URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 353
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
155 PM CDT Mon Jun 2 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Oklahoma Panhandle
  Texas Panhandle and South Plains

* Effective this Monday afternoon and evening from 155 PM until
  900 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 85
    mph likely
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Scattered to numerous thunderstorms are forecast to
develop and evolve into a couple of thunderstorm clusters this
afternoon and spread northeastward through the early evening. 
Severe gusts (60-85 mph) will be the primary hazard with the
stronger storms and their associated convective outflow.  Large hail
may also accompany the stronger thunderstorm cores.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles east and west of a line from 20 miles north of Guymon
OK to 50 miles south southeast of Lubbock TX. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU3).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 75 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
23030.

Mesoscale Discussion 1078
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Areas affected...the Texas Panhandle

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 353...

Valid 022048Z - 022215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 353
continues.

SUMMARY...An increase in convective intensity is expected over the
next 1 to 2 hours.

DISCUSSION...A well-developed outflow boundary has developed and is
emanating from storms across the western Texas Panhandle. This
outflow has mostly outrun the storms thus far. However, it is
quickly moving toward more favorable instability across the central
and eastern Panhandle. In fact, a boundary is apparent on the AMA
0.5 degree base reflectivity east of the radar which likely
represents the edge of the low 70s dewpoints across the eastern
Panhandle. 

As these boundaries collide, expect strong updrafts which should
strengthen the cold pool and severe wind gusts within the line. The
greatest threat for isolated 80-90 mph wind gusts this
afternoon/evening likely exists from this boundary collision
northeastward. This region has the most favorable diurnal timing and
the expectation for storm intensification as this line moves towards
the greater instability.

Mesoscale Discussion 1077

0347 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Areas affected...Northeastern Colorado northeastward through
southwestern MN

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 022047Z - 022245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development is likely this afternoon and
evening along a cold front across much of central Nebraska and
adjacent areas. Severe wind gusts and large hail will be the main
threats.

DISCUSSION...A Cu field is developing this afternoon across central
Nebraska to the south of a slowly sagging cold front. Very large
instability is present with temperatures rising into the upper 80s
and low 90s F across the region. Continued boundary-layer mixing
should erode any remaining inhibition, supporting convection
initiating in the next couple of hours. A number of factors should
contribute to quickly amalgamating storms, including widespread
initiation, largely line-parallel (and relatively modest) bulk shear
vectors, and ML LCLs between 1500-2000 m AGL. Large hail will be
possible with the strongest cores, particularly early in individual
storms' lifecycles, with a transition to a more widespread wind
threat likely during the evening. A tornado or two cannot be ruled
out amidst possibly complex storm interactions and/or stronger
updrafts interacting with locally enhanced surface vertical
vorticity near the front. A watch is possible this afternoon to
address these threats.

Areas affected...Portions of West Texas and the Trans Pecos into
southeast New Mexico

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 022021Z - 022115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated large hail and severe wind gusts are possible
this afternoon and into this evening.

DISCUSSION...Moderate instability has developed across the Trans
Pecos and into West Texas with 1500 to 2000 J/kg MLCAPE. Some
convection has formed along the higher terrain from southeast New
Mexico to the Davis Mountains in Texas. A belt of slightly stronger
mid-level flow will overspread this region through the late
afternoon and into the evening, with RAP forecast soundings
indicating 35 to 40 knots of effective shear where southerly or
southeasterly flow remains by 23Z to 00Z. Therefore, a few
supercells are possible with a threat for large hail and severe wind
gusts. 

Large-scale forcing is mostly moving away from the region, so storm
coverage will likely remain isolated.

Mesoscale Discussion 1075
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0247 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Areas affected...eastern Colorado and western Kansas into far
southwest Nebraska.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 021947Z - 022115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected this afternoon with a primary
threat of severe wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...A gradient of instability exists across the central
High Plains with dewpoints in the 40s near the Front Range and in
the upper 60s across southwest Kansas. SPC mesoanalysis shows a
weakly unstable, but uncapped environment across southeast Colorado
where cold air associated with the upper low has started to move
east of the terrain. As heating continues and temperatures continue
to cool aloft, expect an uncapped environment across much of eastern
Colorado and western Kansas. In addition, ascent will increase as
the trough advances east. 

Therefore, expect a gradual increase in convective coverage across
northeast New Mexico and eastern Colorado this afternoon.
Eventually, these storms should become more intense as they move
toward greater instability. Some large hail is possible initially,
however, severe wind gusts will be preferred. Very steep lapse rates
will support the potential for some significant severe wind gusts of
80-90 mph this evening (in western Kansas), particularly where any
bowing line segments can develop. 

A watch will likely be needed later this afternoon for the threat
from these storms, and storms which will likely move into southwest
Kansas from watch 353.

Mesoscale Discussion 1074
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0214 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Areas affected...Southeastern Wyoming and northeastern Colorado into
western Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 021914Z - 022115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development is likely this afternoon, posing
a threat primarily for severe wind gusts and large hail.

DISCUSSION...Congested Cu are present in visible satellite imagery
across southeastern Wyoming, especially along the higher terrain in
advance of a slowly-southward-sagging cold front. A surface low is
developing in northeastern Colorado, promoting backing southeasterly
low-level flow and some moisture advection into the area. Limited
upper-level cloudiness has supported temperatures rising into the
mid-/upper-70s across the area, likely yielding minimal convective
inhibition in the short term.

As the cold front continues to move southward and a mid-level wave
impinges on the region, scattered thunderstorm development appears
likely in the next couple hours. 12z HREF guidance depicts multiple
stronger updrafts developing off the Laramie Mountains and moving
east into a well-mixed and unstable airmass. Amidst modest bulk
shear values (~30-35 kts) and relatively straight shear profiles,
some splitting supercells and mixed-mode storms are possible. The
primary threats should be large hail and local severe wind gusts
with the stronger cores, especially as they mature in the Nebraska
Panhandle.

Additional thunderstorms are expected in western Nebraska and points
eastward as storms erupt along the cold front later this
afternoon/evening. Trends will continue to be monitored in that
region for possible MCD/watch issuance there.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0344 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Valid 041200Z - 101200Z

Fire weather concerns are forecast to be limited over the coming
week.  The upper-level pattern will largely be characterized by
cyclonic flow over the CONUS through Friday (Day 5) with a series of
shortwave troughs moving through the flow.  By the weekend, a ridge
of high pressure is expected to start building over the West,
leading to a warming and drying trend.  However, the probability of
critical meteorological fire weather conditions (strong winds and
low RH) over dry fuels in the coming week appears low at this time.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Valid 022000Z - 031200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE TEXAS
PANHANDLE AND NORTHWEST OKLAHOMA INTO WESTERN KANSAS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are likely from the Texas Panhandle
and northwest Oklahoma into western Kansas.  Severe gusts 60-75 mph
will be the primary hazard and localized gusts 75-90 mph are
possible.

...20 UTC Update...
The forecast largely remains on track with only minor adjustments
needed. For a general overview of the severe risk, see the
discussion below.

...Minnesota...
Convection associated with a pronounced MCV traversing MN has
persisted longer than anticipated, and has yielded a few
strong/severe wind gusts over the past 1-2 hours. Although
downstream buoyancy is limited (SBCAPE between 500-1000 J/kg), a
corridor of steep low-level lapse rates exists immediately
downstream of the cluster. These low-level thermodynamics should
continue to promote a severe wind threat for the next few hours as
the MCV migrates northeast towards the MN Arrowhead region. 15% wind
probabilities have been expanded downstream to account for this
concern in conjunction with recently issued WW #354.

...Southern High Plains...
A convective cluster is beginning to organize across western TX and
into parts of the TX Panhandle. A pronounced boundary evident in
regional radar imagery is propagating due eastward into an
increasingly buoyant air mass, which should promote a steady
increase in convective coverage through early evening. An 18 UTC AMA
sounding sampled very buoyant conditions (SBCAPE of around 3000
J/kg) with a deepening boundary layer. While wind profiles are
currently not overly impressive, favorable thermodynamics should
promote cold-pool driven storm propagation for the next few hours
until mid-level flow increases later tonight and favors increasing
organization across the Panhandles, southwest KS, and northwest OK.
For additional near-term details see MCD #1075.

...Florida...
Persistent convection through early/mid-afternoon has resulted in
the development of an expansive cirrus shield across the FL
Peninsula with an notable cold pool along the FL west coast. Risk
probabilities have been removed to account for these trends, though
20-30 knot mid-level flow sampled by regional VWPs suggests that
some severe threat may persist within ongoing convection across the
greater Miami, FL area. While remaining daytime heating will be
muted under the cirrus canopy, temperatures warming into the 80s
coupled with a developing sea breeze along Florida's east coast may
support additional convection later this afternoon/early evening (as
hinted by recent CAM guidance).

..Moore.. 06/02/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1128 AM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025/

...Southern High Plains into KS...
Visible-satellite imagery shows a potent mid-level shortwave trough
over AZ, which is forecast to move east-northeastward into northeast
NM this evening and south-central High Plains by daybreak.  Farther
east, a patch of stratus over the northeast TX Panhandle and western
OK is attributable to the northwest periphery of richer low-level
moisture (upper 60s surface dewpoints) per late morning analysis. 
The leading band of large-scale ascent with the Desert Southwest
disturbance is progressing eastward across central NM southward into
southwest TX, as indicated by mid- to high-level clouds and
convection.  

Strong heating will continue this afternoon ahead of the cloud
shield across the southern High Plains into eastern CO/western KS. 
Very steep 0-3 km lapse rates and moderate to very strong buoyancy
(1000-3500 J/kg MLCAPE) and eroding convective inhibition, will
favor scattered storms developing by mid afternoon on the western
part of the moist/unstable sector.  Relatively modest mid to
high-level flow will favor organized multicells.  As storm outflow
begins to congeal and as storms move eastward into an increasingly
moist airmass (PW rising from 1 inch to 1.5 inches), a propensity
for widespread thunderstorms and outflow will peak by early evening.
Forecast experience in the combination of PW, buoyancy, sufficient
shear for multicells, and high agreement in a linear storm mode, all
strongly suggest severe gusts will be the primary hazard.  Gusts
60-75 mph will be common with the stronger surges of outflow and
localized peak gusts 75-90 mph are possible.  Have upgraded to
30-percent significant wind due to confidence in intense outflow. 
CAMs show this activity spreading east across western and northern
OK and into much of central KS before weakening late this evening
into the early overnight.  

...Central High Plains to MN...
A mid-level shortwave trough is forecast to continue eastward across
MT and the northern Plains.  A surface cold front from northwest MN
southwestward into the central High Plains is forecast to focus
thunderstorms this afternoon into tonight.  Strong heating is
expected ahead of this front, where moderate destabilization will be
aided by upper 50s to mid 60s surface dewpoints.  

Initial thunderstorm development is expected during the afternoon 
across MN where the strongest low-level convergence will be in
place.  Dewpoints (and overall buoyancy) will be lower here than
areas farther southwest, which is expected to limit overall storm
strength and contribute to an anafrontal storm character.  Farther
southwest, isolated storms will probably develop by mid afternoon
over southeast WY/NE Panhandle with increasing storm coverage as
this activity moves east during the late afternoon/evening.  Strong
buoyancy will favor robust updrafts, but deep-layer shear will be
modest.  This weaker shear coupled with linear forcing is expected
to result in a quick transition to a predominantly linear mode. As a
result, some supercell threat is possible early in the convective
evolution but, storm mergers and potential clustering/line segments
favor a hail risk transitioning rather quickly to more wind.  Some
continuation of a severe threat (mainly wind) may persist late into
the evening and early overnight across NE, near the terminus of a
45-kt south-southwesterly LLJ.  

...South FL...
Shortwave trough moving over the central Gulf of America is forecast
to continue southeastward into the eastern Gulf, with increasing
large-scale ascent downstream across much of the FL Peninsula. 
Thunderstorm coverage will gradually increase through the mid
afternoon with severe/damaging gusts and large hail possible with
the stronger cores.  This activity will likely weaken by the early
evening.

Fire weather concerns are expected to remain relatively low tomorrow
across the CONUS, so no changes are needed to the ongoing forecast
(see discussion below).

..Jirak.. 06/02/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0107 AM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025/

...Synopsis...
Broad cyclonic flow over much of the West, Plains, and Midwest will
continue on Tuesday. The cutoff low in southern California will
reach the lower Colorado Valley by Wednesday morning. A surface
boundary will stall in the central Great Basin. While dry and breezy
conditions are possible north of the boundary in parts of
Nevada/Utah/western Colorado, precipitation from Monday will likely
have some impact on fuels. Furthermore, cloud cover from additional
activity in the Southwest will also have some tendency to keep RH
higher. Given these factors, only locally elevated conditions are
expected where rainfall amounts remain minimal.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN EASTERN NEW
MEXICO/SOUTHERN COLORADO AND THE EASTERN MIDWEST/LOWER GREAT
LAKES...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible from late afternoon
Wednesday through early morning Thursday in southern Colorado to
eastern New Mexico. Isolated damaging winds may occur across the
eastern Midwest to Lower Great Lakes from mid-afternoon to evening.

...Eastern New Mexico into Southern Colorado...
A southern-stream midlevel trough and accompanying speed maximum
will move east-northeastward across the Southwest into the
southern/central High Plains through the period. Preceding this
feature, widely scattered thunderstorms will spread eastward from
the Southwest to the central/southern High Plains from the afternoon
into the evening/overnight hours. As thunderstorms advance/develop
into eastern NM/southern CO, gradually increasing boundary-layer
moisture (in response to the approaching wave) and diurnal heating
should favor some increase in thunderstorm intensity. Around 40 kt
of deep-layer shear will support a couple organized storms, capable
of producing isolated large hail and severe wind gusts into the
overnight hours. Farther south, additional thunderstorm development
is possible over terrain features across the Trans-Pecos, given
substantial boundary-layer moisture across the region. While
moderate-strong buoyancy and favorable deep-layer shear would
conditionally support isolated strong/severe storms, confidence in
this scenario is currently low -- given lingering inhibition and a
lack of larger-scale ascent.

...Eastern Midwest into the Lower Great Lakes...
A trailing belt of moderate-strong midlevel southwesterly flow will
overlie a weakening/stalling cold front extending across the region.
Widely scattered thunderstorms will track east-northeastward
along/immediately ahead of the front, where a weakly unstable air
mass and around 30-40 kt of deep-layer shear will be in place. This
will support a couple loosely organized storm clusters capable of
producing locally damaging wind gusts during the afternoon and early
evening hours.

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE SOUTHERN
GREAT PLAINS TO THE MID-MS VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible from the southern Great
Plains to the Midwest, mainly from midday to mid-evening Tuesday. A
couple tornadoes, damaging winds, and large hail may occur.

...Synopsis...
A southern-stream midlevel shortwave trough, initially over the
central High Plains, will move northeastward into the Mid/Upper MS
Valley while becoming absorbed into a broad large-scale trough
across the western/central CONUS. A related cold front extending
from the Upper Midwest southwestward to a weak lee cyclone over the
central High Plains will advance east-southeastward across the MS
Valley and southern Plains through the period. This large-scale
evolution will result in a belt of moderate-strong midlevel
southwesterly flow from the southern Plains to the Upper Midwest,
where a broad/strong low-level jet will overlie a moist,
destabilizing boundary layer.

...Central Texas to the Ozarks...
Modestly enhanced/focused forcing for ascent preceding the
southern-stream shortwave trough and weak lee cyclone over the
southern/central Plains will support numerous bands of
eastward-moving thunderstorms during the afternoon into the
evening/overnight hours. While overnight convection and related
boundary-layer overturning is expected here, diurnal heating of an
increasingly moist boundary layer (lower 70s dewpoints) will still
yield moderate surface-based buoyancy. This, combined with 30-40 kt
of effective shear, will support a mix of supercell clusters and
organized line segments -- capable of producing scattered severe
wind gusts, large hail, and possibly a couple embedded tornadoes.
While there does appear to be a focused/favorable corridor for
swaths of severe wind with upscale-growing convection (especially
over the central/southern Plains), early-day storms limit confidence
in the overall convective evolution -- precluding an upgrade to
30-percent wind/ENH at this time. 

...Mid MS Valley to the Upper Midwest...
Increased cloud coverage across the warm/moist sector with
northeastern extent will tend to limit instability, especially given
poor midlevel lapse rates. Nevertheless, ample boundary-layer
moisture and at least pockets of heating will contribute to
weak/locally moderate surface-based buoyancy ahead of the cold
front. Given 40-50 kt of effective shear amid the strong/broad
low-level jet, convective organization into clusters/lines and some
supercell structures is expected along/ahead of the cold front.
Widely scattered damaging winds will be the primary concern with
this activity, though isolated instances of severe hail will also be
possible.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1147 AM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Valid 021700Z - 031200Z

The ongoing forecast for elevated fire weather conditions across the
northern Sacramento Valley in California is on track with no changes
needed.  Surface observations this morning across the region
indicate RH values already below 20% with northerly wind gusts over
20 mph.  These elevated fire weather conditions should persist into
the middle of the afternoon when the wind speeds should weaken as
the surface pressure gradient relaxes across the area.

..Jirak.. 06/02/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0106 AM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025/

...Synopsis...
Broad cyclonic flow will be present across much of the northern tier
states today. A cutoff upper low will slowly sag southeastward off
the southern California coast. High pressure will move into the
Northwest and northern Rockies. A surface front will stall in the
central/southern Great Basin.

...Sacramento Valley...
A few hours of elevated fire weather appears probable in the
northern Sacramento Valley during the morning into the early
afternoon. Northerly winds of 15-25 mph will occur along with RH
falling to 15-20%. While fuels are only marginally receptive (ERCs
just not reaching the 70th percentile per ONCC), the critical
meteorological conditions suggest at least some risk for fire
spread.

Day 1 Convective Outlook

1128 AM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Valid 021630Z - 031200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE TEXAS
PANHANDLE AND NORTHWEST OKLAHOMA INTO WESTERN KANSAS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are likely from the Texas Panhandle
and northwest Oklahoma into western Kansas.  Severe gusts 60-75 mph
will be the primary hazard and localized gusts 75-90 mph are
possible.

...Southern High Plains into KS...
Visible-satellite imagery shows a potent mid-level shortwave trough
over AZ, which is forecast to move east-northeastward into northeast
NM this evening and south-central High Plains by daybreak.  Farther
east, a patch of stratus over the northeast TX Panhandle and western
OK is attributable to the northwest periphery of richer low-level
moisture (upper 60s surface dewpoints) per late morning analysis. 
The leading band of large-scale ascent with the Desert Southwest
disturbance is progressing eastward across central NM southward into
southwest TX, as indicated by mid- to high-level clouds and
convection.  

Strong heating will continue this afternoon ahead of the cloud
shield across the southern High Plains into eastern CO/western KS. 
Very steep 0-3 km lapse rates and moderate to very strong buoyancy
(1000-3500 J/kg MLCAPE) and eroding convective inhibition, will
favor scattered storms developing by mid afternoon on the western
part of the moist/unstable sector.  Relatively modest mid to
high-level flow will favor organized multicells.  As storm outflow
begins to congeal and as storms move eastward into an increasingly
moist airmass (PW rising from 1 inch to 1.5 inches), a propensity
for widespread thunderstorms and outflow will peak by early evening.
Forecast experience in the combination of PW, buoyancy, sufficient
shear for multicells, and high agreement in a linear storm mode, all
strongly suggest severe gusts will be the primary hazard.  Gusts
60-75 mph will be common with the stronger surges of outflow and
localized peak gusts 75-90 mph are possible.  Have upgraded to
30-percent significant wind due to confidence in intense outflow. 
CAMs show this activity spreading east across western and northern
OK and into much of central KS before weakening late this evening
into the early overnight.  

...Central High Plains to MN...
A mid-level shortwave trough is forecast to continue eastward across
MT and the northern Plains.  A surface cold front from northwest MN
southwestward into the central High Plains is forecast to focus
thunderstorms this afternoon into tonight.  Strong heating is
expected ahead of this front, where moderate destabilization will be
aided by upper 50s to mid 60s surface dewpoints.  

Initial thunderstorm development is expected during the afternoon 
across MN where the strongest low-level convergence will be in
place.  Dewpoints (and overall buoyancy) will be lower here than
areas farther southwest, which is expected to limit overall storm
strength and contribute to an anafrontal storm character.  Farther
southwest, isolated storms will probably develop by mid afternoon
over southeast WY/NE Panhandle with increasing storm coverage as
this activity moves east during the late afternoon/evening.  Strong
buoyancy will favor robust updrafts, but deep-layer shear will be
modest.  This weaker shear coupled with linear forcing is expected
to result in a quick transition to a predominantly linear mode. As a
result, some supercell threat is possible early in the convective
evolution but, storm mergers and potential clustering/line segments
favor a hail risk transitioning rather quickly to more wind.  Some
continuation of a severe threat (mainly wind) may persist late into
the evening and early overnight across NE, near the terminus of a
45-kt south-southwesterly LLJ.  

...South FL...
Shortwave trough moving over the central Gulf of America is forecast
to continue southeastward into the eastern Gulf, with increasing
large-scale ascent downstream across much of the FL Peninsula. 
Thunderstorm coverage will gradually increase through the mid
afternoon with severe/damaging gusts and large hail possible with
the stronger cores.  This activity will likely weaken by the early
evening.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM
SOUTHERN/CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS ACROSS THE CENTRAL PLAINS INTO
SOUTHWESTERN MN...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible across the High Plains
into southwestern Minnesota. Severe gusts and large hail are the
expected hazards.

...Central High Plains to MN...
Early morning satellite imagery depicts a northern-stream shortwave
trough moving into western MT. Expectation is for this shortwave to
continue eastward across MT and the northern Plains today, ending
the period over far northwestern Ontario. Surface cyclogenesis is
anticipated over SD ahead of this shortwave. The resulting surface
low will track quickly northeastward into northern MN along a
seasonally strong cold front. This front, which recent surface
analysis places from northwest MN into the far northern NE
Panhandle, is expected to extend from the MN Arrowhead through
central NE by 00Z tonight. Strong heating is expected ahead of this
front, bringing temperatures into the upper 80s/low 90s from central
MN into central NE. These temperatures coupled with dewpoints in the
upper 50s to mid 60s will foster airmass destabilization, and
thunderstorm development is expected as the cold front and
large-scale forcing for ascent interacts with this destabilized
airmass.

Initial thunderstorm development is expected during the afternoon 
across MN where the strongest low-level convergence will be in
place. Dewpoints (and overall buoyancy) will be lower here than
areas farther southwest, which is expected to limit overall storm
strength and contribute to an anafrontal storm character. Late
afternoon/early evening storm development is likely farther
southwest into central NE along the wind shift. Strong buoyancy will
favor robust updrafts, but deep-layer shear will be modest. This
weaker shear coupled with linear forcing is expected to result in a
quick transition to a predominantly linear mode. As a result, some
supercell threat is possible early in the convective evolution but,
storm mergers and potential clustering/line segments favor a hail
risk transitioning rather quickly to more wind. 

Large-scale ascent could also help support another area of
thunderstorms over southeast WY and the adjacent NE Panhandle. The
strength and/or organization of these storms is uncertain, but there
is some chance they will persist long enough to interact with the
storms along front, locally enhancing the severe potential.

...Southern High Plains...
Satellite imagery shows a well-defined shortwave trough moving
across the Southwest. This shortwave is forecast to reach the
southern High Plains by late evening. Increasing large-scale ascent
will result in scattered thunderstorms across much of the region
during the afternoon and evening. Some isolated hail is possible
early, but these storms are expected to become increasingly outflow
dominant as they move into the deeply mixed airmass over the West
TX, the TX/OK Panhandles, and southwest KS. A few severe gusts are
possible.

...South FL...
Shortwave trough moving over the central Gulf Coast is forecast to
continue southeastward into the eastern Gulf, with increasing
large-scale ascent downstream across much of the FL Peninsula.  This
synoptic evolution favors a considerable amount of convection, with
scattered to widespread thunderstorms beginning as early as 18Z.
Some occasionally strong updrafts are possible, capable of both
isolated hail and damaging gusts.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0339 AM CDT Mon Jun 02 2025

Valid 051200Z - 101200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Latest guidance has trended towards a climatologically active
extended period for severe potential. It appears that 15 percent
severe areas will likely be delineated each day within a persistent
split-flow regime. Belts of enhanced mid-level westerlies should
accompany the train of low-amplitude southern-stream shortwave
impulses. Meanwhile, above-average agreement exists with the
amplification of a large-scale trough into the north-central states
towards the end of the period. This would suppress the southern
stream southward in the southern Great Plains to Deep South.

Reliably timing individual low-amplitude impulses/MCVs can be
difficult in this setup. But it appears that the initial impulse
ejecting across the southern Rockies around 12Z Thursday should
serve to focus severe potential from the TX Panhandle into southern
KS on D4. This feature may continue eastward towards the Mid-MS
Valley/eastern Midwest on D5/Friday. But with probable weak
mid-level lapse rates downstream and lack of run-to-run continuity
across guidance, will defer on a 15 percent area highlight.

Areas affected...Parts of central into southeast Texas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 352...

Valid 012037Z - 012200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 352
continues.

SUMMARY...The risk of large hail and severe wind gusts continues
across Severe Thunderstorm Watch 352.

DISCUSSION...A couple semi-discrete supercells continue to track
southeastward along the stationary boundary from central into
southeast TX -- along the east/southeastern periphery of around 2500
J/kg MLCAPE. While these storms are generally becoming removed from
this stronger instability, they will still pose a risk of isolated
large hail and locally severe gusts in the near term. To their
northwest, fresh updrafts are evolving along the stationary boundary
near Waco TX. Given that these evolving storms will track
southeastward through the strongest instability amid 40 kt of
effective shear, gradual intensification into semi-discrete
supercells is also possible -- posing a risk of large to very large
hail and severe wind gusts.

Areas affected...Parts of western/central North Carolina and far
northern South Carolina

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 011913Z - 012145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Widely scattered thunderstorms are expected to continue
developing/advancing eastward across western/central NC and far
northern SC through the afternoon. The strongest storms will be
capable of producing locally damaging wind gusts and marginally
severe hail. The severe threat is expected to remain too isolated
for a watch.

DISCUSSION...Along the southern periphery of a large-scale trough
over the Northeast, VWP data and earlier 12Z soundings sampled a
belt of 40-50 kt midlevel westerly flow across NC. Here,
differential heating along a weak E/W-oriented surface boundary is
supporting isolated to widely scattered showers, which should
continue to deepening into thunderstorms -- given sufficient (albeit
weak) surface-based instability. The moderate/strong westerly flow
aloft is yielding elongated/mostly straight hodographs (around 40 kt
of effective shear), which could promote localized convective
organization into small clusters capable of locally damaging wind
gusts and perhaps marginally severe hail. Current thinking is that
the overall severe threat will remain too isolated for a watch,
though convective trends will be monitored.

0153 PM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...central Colorado and north-central New Mexico

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 011853Z - 012130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will continue to develop through the
afternoon. Instability will support at least some potential for hail
and gusty thunderstorm outflows. However, the lack of stronger
deep-layer shear should limit the overall severe threat to being
more transient in nature. A watch is not likely.

DISCUSSION...Terrain-driven low-level convergence has resulted in
the development of convection across the higher terrain of central
Colorado and north-central New Mexico. To the east of the higher
terrain, surface dewpoints in the 50s coupled with diurnal heating
has resulted in a corridor of MUCAPE between 1000-2000 J/kg, with
the higher values tied to higher surface moisture. Despite
sufficient instability for storm maintenance, deep-layer shear is
weak, with effective-layer shear generally less than 20 knots should
limit the ability for updraft organization. The result should be
updrafts initially tied to the terrain, where low-level convergence
will force ascent. Isolated hail and perhaps a strong wind gust or
two may be possible with these terrain-driven storms.

With time, aggregate cold pools may move off the terrain and into
the high-elevation plains adjacent to the mountains allowing for
additional thunderstorm development. Here, continued heating will
allow most-unstable CAPE to continue to increase until convective
cloud debris overspreads the area reducing insolation. However,
MUCAPE around 2000-2500 J/kg will remain possible. Forecast
soundings indicated that some increase in effective-layer shear, but
still generally below 30 knots. This may allow for some
conglomeration of updrafts and at least transient multi-cell
clusters capable of producing large hail and a strong wind gust or
two.

Given the anticipated isolated/transient nature of any organized
severe threat (should it develop) a watch is not anticipated.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 352
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
140 PM CDT Sun Jun 1 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  North-Central and East Texas

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 140 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 2.5 inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Severe storms including supercell development are expected
this afternoon as a moist environment heats and destabilizes. Large
hail is expected with the most intense storms, with wind damage also
possible as these storms generally spread southeastward through
early/mid-evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 70
statute miles east and west of a line from 30 miles north of
Stephenville TX to 75 miles south southeast of Huntsville TX. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 600. Mean storm motion vector
33025.

Mesoscale Discussion 1060
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0705 AM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...South-central Florida Peninsula

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 011205Z - 011400Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...An isolated tornado threat may continue for the next two
to three hours across south-central Florida. The threat is expected
to remain localized, and weather watch issuance appears unlikely,
although trends will be monitored.

DISCUSSION...An east-to-west band of strong thunderstorms is ongoing
across south-central Florida, along a zone of somewhat focused
low-level convergence. The storms are being supported by a shortwave
trough that is moving through the eastern Gulf. A mid-level jet
streak is analyzed by the RAP from the eastern Gulf extending
eastward across the Florida Peninsula. This jet has strengthened
deep-layer shear over south-central Florida into the 40 to 50 knot
range, according to the RAP. This will support isolated supercell
development this morning. Although RAP forecast soundings across
south-central Florida suggest that low-level shear is not
particularly strong, storm-relative helicity could be locally higher
near the zone of low-level convergence. As a result, transient
supercells could be capable of producing low to mid-level rotation,
with a brief tornado possible. Marginally severe wind gusts could
also occur. The threat should remain localized, and watch issuance
is currently not expected.

Mesoscale Discussion 1059
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0622 AM CDT Sun Jun 01 2025

Areas affected...Southern Oklahoma...North Texas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 351...

Valid 011122Z - 011315Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 351
continues.

SUMMARY...A few strong thunderstorms, with isolated severe gusts or
hail, will be possible over the next few hours. However, any threat
should remain localized, and weather watch issuance is not expected
to the south of the current watch.

DISCUSSION...A cluster of thunderstorms is ongoing in south-central
Oklahoma, which is near a 500 mb jet analyzed by the RAP. This
cluster will continue to move southward across the remainder of
Oklahoma into parts of north Texas over the next few hours. Any
severe threat associated with the cluster will likely remain
localized and brief, primarily due to weak instability. For this
reason, weather watch issuance is not expected to the south of the
ongoing watch. 

As the outflow boundary, associated with the cluster, stalls over
north Texas later this morning, it will likely become a focus for
new convective development. Through that time, the situation will
continue to be monitored for changes in severe weather potential.
