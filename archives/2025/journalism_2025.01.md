The National Weather Service issued a critical fire weather alert for Los Angeles County on Monday.
A fire in the Pacific Palisades – which began burning about six miles from UCLA on Tuesday morning – has since reached more than 2,900 acres, but it does not pose a risk to campus at this time, said UCLA Office of Emergency Management spokesperson Seán Devine.&#160;
Critical fire weather warnings – known as red flag warnings – warn of potential extreme wildfire behavior, according to the NWS.&#160;
A NWS “particularly dangerous situation” warning for potentially destructive conditions was also issued for the Santa Monica Mountains, which are near the UCLA campus.
