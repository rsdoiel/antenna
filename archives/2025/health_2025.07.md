## Mechanisms of sepsis-induced acute liver injury: a comprehensive review

date: 2025-02-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Sepsis is a severe, often life-threatening form of organ dysfunction that arises from an inappropriately regulated host response to infectious pathogen exposure. As the largest gland in the body, the liver serves as a regulatory hub for metabolic, immune, and detoxification activity. It is also an early sepsis target organ such that hepatic dysfunction is observed in 34-46% of patients with sepsis. The precise mechanisms that give rise to sepsis-induced liver injury, however, remain incompletely understood. Based on the research conducted to date, dysregulated systemic inflammation, microbial translocation, microcirculatory abnormalities, cell death, metabolic dysfunction, and liver inflammation may all contribute to the liver damage that can arise in the context of septicemia. This review was developed to provide an overview summarizing the potential mechanisms underlying sepsis-induced liver injury, informing the selection of potential targets for therapeutic intervention and providing a framework for the alleviation of patient symptoms and the improvement of prognostic outcomes.

## Staphylococcus aureus utilizes vimentin to internalize human keratinocytes

date: 2025-02-21, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionVimentin is an intermediate filamentous cytoskeletal protein involved in cell migration, adhesion, and division. Recent studies have demonstrated that several bacteria and viruses interact with vimentin to facilitate entry and trafficking within eukaryotic cells. However, the relationship between Staphylococcus aureus and vimentin remains unclear.MethodsIn the current study, we elucidated vimentin expression mechanism in human keratinocytes infected with S. aureus using Western blot (WB), Flow cytometry, Immunofluorescence (IF) staining, utilizing neutralizing antibodies, and small interference (si) RNA, and a vimentin overexpression vector. The physical interaction between vimentin and S. aureus was shown by IF on cell surface, intra- and intercellular space.ResultsHaCaT cells increased vimentin expression through physical interaction with live S. aureus, and not by heat-killed bacteria or bacterial culture supernatants. The Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 signaling pathway, which includes interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling activation, was involved in S. aureus-mediated vimentin expression. The vimentin protein induced by S. aureus was secreted extracellularly and bound to S. aureus in the culture media. The binding of vimentin to S. aureus accelerated the intracellular infection of HaCaT cells.DiscussionThus, these experiments elucidated the mechanism of vimentin protein expression during S. aureus infection in human skin keratinocytes and revealed the role of vimentin in this process. These findings suggest that vimentin could serve as a potential target for the prevention or treatment of S. aureus infections.

## The intestinal microbiota modulates the visceral sensitivity involved in IBS induced by restraint combined with tail clustering

date: 2025-02-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveTo compare three common stimuli that induce emotional stress to identify the optimal method for establishing an animal model that aligns with the clinical pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and to explore the gut microbiota mechanisms underlying IBS development.MethodsThirty-six SPF-grade female Kunming mice were randomly divided into four groups: the normal control (NC) group, the restraint stress (BM) group, the tail clamp stress (CTM) group, and the restraint combined with tail clamp stress (BCTM) group, with 9 mice in each group. The NC group was fed normally without any stimulation. The BM group was subjected to restraint stress. The CTM group received intermittent tail clamp stress. The BCTM group underwent both restraint stress and intermittent tail clamp stress. The stimulation time for each group was 1 hour, and the modeling duration was 7 days. General behavioral changes in the mice were observed. The fecal water content was measured and calculated. The pain threshold, gastric residue rate, small intestine propulsion rate, and serum levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), serotonin (5-HT), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) were assessed. Histopathological analysis of the small intestine and colon tissues was performed. 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing was subsequently conducted. The effects of different stimuli on mouse symptoms, gastrointestinal motility, visceral hypersensitivity, inflammation levels, and the gut microbiota were analyzed, and correlation analysis was performed.ResultsCompared with the NC group, the BM, CTM, and BCTM groups of mice presented varying degrees of emotional hyperreactivity, accompanied by significantly reduced food intake and fecal water content and markedly elevated levels of inflammation, all of which are indicative of IBS symptoms. Among them, the BCTM group presented the most pronounced emotional hyperreactivity and irritability. The mice in the BCTM group had significantly higher gastric residue rates and 5-HT levels, with a marked reduction in pain tolerance. The gut microbiota of the mice in the BM, CTM, and BCTM groups all exhibited dysbiosis, with changes in the diversity, structural composition, and function of the microbial community. Specific bacterial taxa were enriched in each stress group, and their corresponding KEGG pathways were also significantly altered. Correlation analysis revealed that SCFAs were significantly positively correlated with the small intestine propulsion rate, whereas 5-HT was positively correlated with the gastric residue rate and negatively correlated with the pain threshold. SCFAs were positively correlated with IL-10 and TNF-α, and 5-HT was significantly positively correlated with IL-10 and TNF-α. In the BCTM group, the characteristic bacteria Acinetobacter and Akkermansia were significantly correlated with SCFAs and 5-HT.Conclusion1. The restraint combined with the tail clamp stress method is superior among the three stress protocols and successfully induces the IBS mouse model. 2. Acinetobacter and Akkermansia may contribute to the development of IBS induced by restraint combined with tail clamp stress through the regulation of SCFAs and 5-HT.

## Development and validation of a nomogram for predicting the outcome of metabolic syndrome among people living with HIV after antiretroviral therapy in China

date: 2025-02-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThe prevalence of metabolic syndrome among people living with HIV (PLWH) is increasing worldwide. This study aimed to develop and validate a nomogram to predict the risk of metabolic syndrome in PLWH receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in China, accounting for both traditional and HIV-specific risk factors.MethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted among PLWH receiving ART at a designated treatment center in Yinzhou District, China. A total of 774 patients were randomly assigned to development and validation cohorts in a 5:5 ratio. Predictive variables were identified using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and multivariable Cox regression analysis. The model’s discriminative ability was assessed using the C-index and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Calibration was evaluated through calibration plots, and clinical utility was assessed using decision curve analysis (DCA).Results﻿The nomogram incorporated age, ART regimen, body mass index, fasting blood glucose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and HIV viral load as predictive factors. The C-index was 0.726 in the development cohort and 0.781 in the validation cohort, indicating strong discriminative ability. AUC values for predicting metabolic syndrome at 1, 2, and 3 years were 0.732, 0.728, and 0.737 in the development cohort, and 0.797, 0.803, and 0.783 in the validation cohort. Calibration plots showed strong concordance between predicted and observed outcomes, while DCA affirmed the model’s clinical applicability.ConclusionA user-friendly nomogram incorporating six routinely collected variables was developed and internally validated, which can effectively predict metabolic syndrome in PLWH following ART.

## Xingnao Jiutan tablets modulate gut microbiota and gut microbiota metabolism to alleviate cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury

date: 2025-02-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionXingnao Jiutan tablets (XNJT), a compound Chinese medicine, have been applied to the treatment of the sequelae of cerebral thrombosis or cerebral hemorrhage, transient cerebral ischemia, and central retinal vein obstruction, etc., but the underlying mechanisms are not yet clear. This research focused on examining the impact of XNJT for cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (MCAO/R) injury, utilizing gut microbiota and metabolomic studies.MethodsThe primary components of XNJT were identified through the application of the HPLC technique. We established a MCAO/ R model in mice and conducted behavioral evaluations, cerebral blood flow measurements, and TTC staining. We used ELISA, high-throughput 16S rDNA gene sequencing, and metabolomics techniques to detect inflammatory factors, microbial populations, and metabolites, respectively. Finally, we performed Spearman correlation analysis to investigate the relationships among gut microbiota and metabolites, comprehensively exploring the mechanisms of XNJT to alleviate cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.ResultsWe discovered that XNJT effectively enhanced neurological performance, alleviated cerebral infarction, diminished neuronal cell death, and increased cerebral blood flow. Moreover, XNJT downregulated the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF, IL-6, and IL-1b. Additionally, XNJT improved gut microbiota levels in MCAO/R mice, particularly Bacteroides, Firmicutes, Escherichia-Shigella, and Ligilactobacillus. Furthermore, XNJT primarily modulated differential metabolites in the gut through Glycerophospholipid, Linoleic acid, and Sphingolipid metabolism pathways. Spearman correlation analysis revealed significant associations among intestinal microbiota and various metabolites.DiscussionIn summary, our findings suggest that XNJT can improve cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury outcomes, reduce inflammatory responses, and regulate gut microbiota and differential metabolites. It’s possible that the potential mechanisms are connected to controlling gut microbiota and metabolism.

## The impact of Babesia ovis-infected Rhipicephalus bursa larvae on the severity of babesiosis in sheep

date: 2025-02-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Ovine babesiosis, caused by Babesia ovis, is a significant tick-borne disease affecting sheep globally, with severe economic implications for sheep farming, particularly in Türkiye. Babesia ovis is transmitted exclusively by adult Rhipicephalus bursa ticks, but the potential role of infected larval stages in modulating disease severity has remained unclear. This study investigated whether infestation with B. ovis-infected R. bursa larvae reduces the severity of babesiosis following subsequent exposure to infected adult ticks. Three experimental sheep were infested with B. ovis-infected larvae, while three control sheep were infested with Babesia-free larvae. Both groups were subsequently exposed to B. ovis-infected adult R. bursa. Daily clinical, molecular, and serological monitoring revealed no clinical signs of babesiosis or B. ovis infection following larval infestation. However, all sheep developed severe clinical babesiosis after exposure to infected adult ticks. No significant differences in disease severity, parasitemia levels, or clinical outcomes were observed between the experimental and control groups, indicating that larval infestation does not confer protection or lead to milder disease courses. These findings confirm the exclusive role of adult R. bursa in B. ovis transmission and emphasize the critical need for vector control strategies targeting adult tick populations during peak activity. This study highlights the importance of understanding stage-specific transmission barriers and their implications for vector-borne disease management. Future research should explore the molecular mechanisms limiting pathogen transmission by immature ticks and investigate comparative transmission dynamics across Babesia species to inform targeted control interventions.

## A new strategy improving TB diagnosis: stratified urine LAM test based on lymphocyte counts

date: 2025-02-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundTraditional lipoarabinomannan tests have limited sensitivity in HIV-negative individuals. Our aims were to compare chemiluminescence-based LAM (AIMLAM) and other diagnostic modalities in HIV-negative patients and to explore whether lymphocyte counts impact the sensitivity and costs of AIMLAM.MethodsThis is a prospective, cross-sectional, diagnostic accuracy study. Participants underwent testing with sputum acid-fast bacilli, sputum culture, GeneXpert, and AIMLAM. Their diagnostic efficiency and cost-effectiveness alone or under different lymphocyte count categories was evaluated.ResultsUsing MRS as a reference, the sensitivities of different diagnostic methods were as follows: sputum smear 27.43%, sputum culture 45.13%, GeneXpert 74.34%, and AIMLAM 71.68%. Patients with lymphocyte counts <0.8 × 109/L were significantly more likely to have a positive AIMLAM result (OR = 9.431, 95% CI: 2.659–33.447, P = 0.001). The sensitivity of AIMLAM in patients with lymphocyte counts <0.8 × 109/L reached 93.02%. The overall cost of AIMLAM to detect a positive TB case was $129.82, lower than sputum culture ($136.10) and GeneXpert ($180.27). For patients with lymphocyte counts <0.8 × 109/L, the cost of AIMLAM was further reduced to $67.84 (a 47.74% decrease), which was lower than GeneXpert ($111.65) and sputum culture ($94.28).ConclusionAIMLAM showed promising diagnostic performance in HIV-negative patients. Stratifying patients using lymphocyte cell counting lifted the sensitivity and lowered the cost of LAM, offering a novel diagnostic strategy for tuberculosis in resource-limited settings.

## Molecular epidemiology of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates in Russia, 2015–2023: current trends and forecasting

date: 2025-02-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe emergence of multidrug resistance in N. gonorrhoeae is a serious global problem, and gonorrhea may soon become an incurable disease. The aim of the study was to characterize the N. gonorrhoeae population in Russia from 2015 to 2023 and predict the potential spread of the most concerning clones.MethodsA total of 996 N. gonorrhoeae isolates were examined during the analyzed period. Ceftriaxone and azithromycin susceptibility testing were performed using the agar dilution method. Microarray-based assays and sequencing were employed to identify the genotypes and genetic markers of antimicrobial resistance.ResultsNo ceftriaxone-resistant isolates were found in Russia, however, the number of isolates with reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone has increased to 22.6% in recent years. Since 2020, approximately 12.5% of isolates have exhibited resistance to azithromycin annually. Two clusters of isolates pose a particular threat to Russia: NG-MAST G2212, linked to MLST 1901/1902, carries a mosaic structure in the penA gene; G12302, linked to MLST 9363, contains mosaic alleles in the mtrR and mtrD genes. Additionally, two new high-risk genogroups were characterized: G18898 and G16206. Both are associated with MLST 10314 and harbor mosaic variants of penA or mtrR/mtrD. Analysis of time series data suggests that isolates with mosaic alleles are unlikely to be eradicated from the population in the near future, potentially worsening the epidemiological situation of gonorrhea in Russia.ConclusionsThe native genetic strains of N. gonorrhoeae in Russia, which are susceptible to cephalosporins and macrolides, are being progressively replaced by globally dominant lineages. To further characterize this epidemiologic shift, ongoing surveillance strategies using molecular epidemiology and the identification of genetic markers will be crucial in curbing the growth and spread of N. gonorrhoeae resistance. Such efforts are vital in ensuring the availability of effective treatments for gonococcal infection.

## Baseline HBsAg quantitative and CD4 T cell counts are associated with HBsAg loss in people living with HIV/HBV coinfection after combined antiretroviral therapy

date: 2025-02-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundAchieving Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss is a significant goal for chronic hepatitis B patients. This study aims to evaluate HBsAg loss in individuals with HIV/HBV coinfection and explore the association of clinical variables with this outcome.MethodsWe enrolled 138 individuals coinfected with HIV/HBV and 480 HBV mono-infected individuals who initiated antiviral treatment. We employed Kaplan-Meier analysis to compare the rate of HBsAg loss between individuals with HIV/HBV coinfection and those with HBV mono-infection. In the HIV/HBV coinfected cohort, we used Cox proportional hazards models to assess the association between various factors and the incidence of HBsAg loss.ResultsThe cumulative HBsAg loss rate was higher among HBV/HIV coinfected individuals (13 patients, 11.5% at year 3) compared to HBV mono-infected individuals (1 patient, 0.6%) after antiviral therapy. In the HIV/HBV coinfected cohort, the multivariable analysis revealed that lower baseline HBsAg level (HR 0.53; 95% CI 0.38-0.74, p<0.001) and baseline CD4 T cell counts < 180 cells/uL (HR 0.32; 95% CI 0.10-0.96, p=0.042) were associated with an increased indicator of HBsAg loss. Additionally, the receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis indicated an area under the curve of 0.771 for baseline HBsAg levels and 0.758 for baseline CD4 cell counts at year 1 in predicting HBsAg loss.ConclusionsAfter antiretroviral therapy, HIV/HBV coinfected adults achieve higher rates of HBsAg loss. Baseline HBsAg quantitative and CD4 T cell counts are associated with HBsAg loss in individuals with HIV/HBV coinfection after combined antiretroviral therapy and may inform treatment decisions.

## Clinical utility of nanopore-targeted sequencing for diagnosing and treating pulmonary infectious diseases from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid

date: 2025-02-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundConventional microbial testing (CMTs) for infectious pathogens faces challenges in rapid and comprehensive detection. Nanopore-targeted sequencing (NTS) is a novel approach for rapid identification of pathogens; however, clinical experience with the application of NTS is limited.MethodsWe evaluated the diagnostic value of NTS for detecting microbes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples in patients with pulmonary infectious disease (PID, 137 cases), non-pulmonary infectious disease (NPID, 32 cases), or with an unknown etiology (11 cases). We performed a comparative analysis of the diagnostic efficacy of NTS and CMTs in identifying pulmonary infectious diseases and investigated the clinical utility of NTS as a diagnostic tool.ResultsNTS was significantly more sensitive than CMTs in detecting PID (86.13% vs 67.15%, P < 0.01), particularly for important specific pathogens. There were no significant differences between NTS and CMTs in terms of specificity, positive predictive value or negative predictive value. Moreover, NTS (not CMTs) detected 56 microorganisms consistent with clinical presentation, indicating that NTS can provide clinicians with additional support for infection diagnosis. Additionally, prior antibiotic exposure had no influence on the detection efficiency of NTS but significantly hindered that of CMTs. After antibiotic adjustments based on NTS findings, 87.76% of patients showed significant improvement, with a notable decrease in the level of inflammatory markers (CRP, NP, PCT, WBC) post-treatment. Furthermore, NTS can significantly shorten turnaround time and provide real-time results for rapid decision making.ConclusionsNTS is more efficient than CMTs in diagnosing pulmonary infectious diseases, particularly in detecting critical or specific pathogens, providing faster and more accurate clinical information even for patients with prior antibiotic exposure. Moreover, NTS can assist clinicians in formulating more effective anti-infection strategies.

## Plasma cell-free DNA Droplet Digital PCR provides rapid and efficient infectious microbiology diagnosis for febrile haematological patients

date: 2025-02-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundFebrile haematological patients are at high risk for potential bloodstream infections, the rapid and accurate identification of pathogens is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) is a novel and ultra-sensitively molecular technique for the rapid detection of pathogens. We evaluated the ability of ddPCR to identify infectious etiologies to discuss the applicability of ddPCR in the diagnosis and treatment of infections for febrile haematological patients.MethodsThis study enrolled and analyzed 89 ddPCR tests performed on 71 febrile haematological patients. We conducted a comparison between ddPCR results, blood culture (BC), and conventional microbiological testing (CMT). Additionally, we analyzed the correlation between ddPCR results and inflammatory factors, as well as their impact on antimicrobial therapy.ResultsDdPCR detected 113 pathogens in 72 plasma samples, while CMT identified 39 pathogens in 32 plasma samples. The detection rate of bacteria and viruses using ddPCR was significantly higher than that of CMT (p <0.0001). The turnaround time (TAT) for pathogenic diagnosis was significantly shorter with ddPCR compared to CMT (p <0.0001). When we used the CMT as reference standard, the sensitivity and specificity of ddPCR were 93.8%, 26.3%, respectively. We observed a positive correlation between the ddPCR results and CRP, PCT and IL-6, and ddPCR (AUC=0.771) has better diagnostic performance. The anti-infective treatment strategies were adjusted for 30 patients based on the positive ddPCR results, with 86.7% (26/30) of these cases demonstrating effectiveness in the anti-infective treatment.ConclusionDdPCR has the potential to enhance pathogen detection in febrile haematological patients by offering high sensitivity, rapid, precise results, it demonstrates better diagnostic performance compared to inflammatory factors and can contribute to the real-time clinical optimization of antimicrobial regimens, thereby enhancing the efficacy of anti-infective therapy.

## O2-dependent incapacitation of the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 repressor HilE

date: 2025-02-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

For successful colonization, pathogenic bacteria need to adapt their metabolism and virulence functions to challenging environments within their mammalian hosts that are frequently characterized by low oxygen (O2) tensions. Upon oral ingestion, the human pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) is exposed to changing O2 and pH levels. Low concentrations of O2, which can enhance the virulence of enteroinvasive pathogens, facilitate the expression of the type three secretion system (T3SS-1) encoded by the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) that is critical for enteroinvasion and pathogenicity of S. Typhimurium. To study the impact of key environmental cues of the intestine when Salmonella encounter enterocytes, we established an in vitro growth model, which allows shifting the concentration of O2 from 0.5% to 11% and the pH from 5.9 to 7.4 in the presence of acetate and the alternative electron acceptor nitrate. Compared to normoxia, hypoxia elevated the expression of SPI-1 genes encoding T3SS-1 translocators and effectors, which resulted in higher invasion and effector translocation in epithelial cells. While hypoxia and pH shift only marginally altered the gene expression of SPI-1 regulators, including the SPI-1 repressor hilE, hypoxia and pH shift completely incapacitated HilE in a post-translational manner, ultimately promoting SPI-1 activity. From these findings, we conclude that O2-dependent HilE function allows for ultrasensitive adaptation of SPI-1 activity in environments with varying O2 availability such as the intestinal tract.

## Clinical application of targeted next-generation sequencing in pneumonia diagnosis among cancer patients

date: 2025-02-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundCancer patients are highly susceptible to infections due to their immunocompromised state from both the malignancy and intensive treatments. Accurate and timely identification of causative pathogens is crucial for effective management and treatment. Targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) has become an important tool in clinical infectious disease diagnosis because of its broad microbial detection range and acceptable cost. However, there is currently a lack of systematic research to evaluate the diagnostic value of this method in cancer patients.MethodsTo evaluate the diagnostic value of tNGS for cancer patients with pneumonia, a retrospective analysis was conducted on 148 patients with suspected pneumonia who were treated at the Henan Cancer Hospital. The tNGS results were compared with conventional microbiological tests (CMT) and clinical diagnoses based on symptoms and imaging studies to assess the diagnostic performance of tNGS in cancer patients with pneumonia.ResultsAmong these 148 patients, 130 were ultimately diagnosed with pneumonia. tNGS demonstrated significantly higher sensitivity (84.62% vs. 56.92%) and diagnostic accuracy (85.81% vs. 62.16%) compared to the CMT method. The tNGS method identified more pathogens than CMT method (87.50% vs 57.14%), regardless of whether they were bacteria, fungi, or viruses, primarily due to its broader pathogen detection range and higher sensitivity compared to the CMT method. tNGS had significantly higher diagnostic accuracy for Pneumocystis jirovecii and Legionella pneumophila than the CMT method, but for most pathogens, tNGS showed higher sensitivity but with a correspondingly lower specificity compared to CMT.ConclusiontNGS demonstrates higher sensitivity and a broader pathogen detection spectrum compared to CMT, making it a valuable diagnostic tool for managing pneumonia in cancer patients.

## Does obesity affect the diagnostic value of various biomarkers for periprosthetic joint infections? A single center retrospective study

date: 2025-02-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to examine the impact of obesity on the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infections (PJI) by assessing the levels and diagnostic efficacy of biomarkers.MethodsA total of 254 patients were divided into obese group (n=59) and non-obese group (n=195) according to BMI. Each group was further divided into the PJI group and the AF group. Data on CRP, ESR, fibrinogen, D-dimer, CRP-albumin ratio (CAR), CRP-lymphocyte ratio (CLR), and CRP-monocyte ratio (CMR) were collected from all patients. ROC curve was performed to evaluate the diagnostic values of these biomarkers.ResultsThe levels of biomarkers were significantly higher in PJI patients compared to the AF patients in both the obese and non-obese groups (P < 0.001), but the levels of biomarkers were similar between the obese and non-obese groups. In the obese group, CRP exhibited the highest diagnostic value (AUC=0.982). In the non-obese group, CAR demonstrated the highest diagnostic value (AUC =0.935). Subgroup analysis showed no significant differences in biomarker levels (P > 0.05).ConclusionsObesity did not affect biomarker levels in patients with PJI. But for obese patients, the diagnostic thresholds for CRP and ESR are higher, and clinical diagnosis should be careful to avoid false positives. CRP and CAR were identified as the most effective biomarkers for diagnosing PJI in the obese and non-obese groups, respectively.

## Characteristic profiles of molecular types, antibiotic resistance, antibiotic resistance genes, and virulence genes of Staphylococcus aureus isolates from caprine mastitis in China

date: 2025-02-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Staphylococcus aureus is a significant pathogen in dairy animals, particularly when it infects the mammary gland; however, its prevalence among dairy goats in China remains poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the distribution and characteristics of S. aureus isolates in dairy goats across China. A total of 515 milk samples were collected from goats diagnosed with mastitis in 14 provinces. These samples underwent bacterial isolation and identification, capsular polysaccharides typing, spa typing, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and assessment of antimicrobial resistance and virulence gene. The findings revealed the isolation of 61 S. aureus strains. The highest prevalence rate was recorded in 2018, at 20.4% (11 out of 54 samples), while the lowest prevalence rate was noted in 2023, at 5.2% (3 out of 58 samples). Among the five regions studied, southern China exhibited the highest prevalence rate of 17.5% (10 out of 57 samples), whereas northeastern China showed the lowest rate at 8.2% (8 out of 97 samples). Capsular polysaccharide type 5 emerged as the most prevalent, accounting for 52.5%, and spa type t521 was identified most frequently, at 19.7%. Notably, 52 isolates (85.2%) demonstrated multidrug resistance, displaying resistance to three or more antibiotics. The resistance rates of S. aureus isolates were significantly high to penicillin (95.1%), followed by enrofloxacin (82.0%), kanamycin (78.7%), and levofloxacin (77.0%). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole exhibited the lowest resistance rate at 11.5%. Resistance rates varied across the five different regions. Additionally, eight genes associated with resistance to six classes of antimicrobials were detected, with the blaZ gene (93.4%) being the most prevalent at 93.4%. Furthermore, nine virulence-associated genes were identified, with clfA being the most common virulence gene, present in all isolates. In conclusion, most S. aureus isolates were multiresistant with diverse resistance patterns. Those diverse antimicrobial resistance profiles associated with corresponding resistance genes (p < 0.05) were reported for the first time in S. aureus from caprine mastitis. Sulfonamides could be prioritized preferentially for the treatment of S. aureus mastitis.

## Chaihuang Qingyi Huoxue granule ameliorates severe acute pancreatitis by modulating gut microbiota and repairing the intestinal mucosal barrier

date: 2025-02-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundDuring severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), damage to the intestinal mucosal barrier and translocation of intestinal pathogenic bacteria are key mechanisms that accelerate the disease progression of SAP. Chaihuang Qingyi Huoxue Granule (CH) is a herbal formula used in the clinical treatment of SAP. This study aims to investigate the role of CH in regulating gut microbiota and intestinal mucosal barrier in SAP rats.MethodsSodium taurocholate (3.5%) was retrogradely perfused into the biliopancreatic duct to establish the model of SAP in rats. CH (4.4 g/kg) was administered by gavage. Serum amylase, lipase, and endotoxin levels were measured. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was used to observe morphological changes in the pancreas and colon. The expression of zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin in the colon was examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot. 16S rDNA gene sequencing was used to analyze the gut microbiota of the rats. The content of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the intestinal contents of the rats was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).ResultsCH reduced serum amylase, lipase, and endotoxin levels in SAP rats, alleviated pathological damage in the pancreas and colon, and restored the expression of ZO-1 and occludin. Moreover, CH alleviated gut microbiota dysbiosis in SAP rats, with restored gut microbiota diversity and structure. At the phylum level, the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes increased, while that of Proteobacteria decreased. At the genus level, the abundance of Ruminococcus 1, Parabacteroides, Prevotellaceae UCG-001, Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group, and Lactobacillus increased, while that of Escherichia-Shigella, Enterococcus, and Enterobacter decreased. In addition, CH increased the levels of SCFAs in the intestinal contents of SAP rats.ConclusionCH ameliorates SAP by maintaining the homeostasis and diversity of the gut microbiota, increasing the levels of SCFAs, and repairing the intestinal mucosal barrier.

## A model for predicting bacteremia species based on host immune response

date: 2025-02-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionClinicians encounter significant challenges in quickly and accurately identifying the bacterial species responsible for patient bacteremia and in selecting appropriate antibiotics for timely treatment. This study introduces a novel approach that combines immune response data from routine blood counts with assessments of immune cell activation, specifically through quantitative measurements of Rho family GTPase activity. The combined data were used to develop a machine-learning model capable of distinguishing specific classes of bacteria and their associations.MethodsWe aimed to determine whether different classes of bacteria elicit distinct patterns of host immune responses, as indicated by quantitative differences in leukocyte populations from routine complete blood counts with differential. Concurrently, we conducted quantitative measurements of activated Rac1 (Rac1•GTP) levels using a novel ‘G-Trap assay’ we developed. With the G-Trap, we measured Rac1•GTP in peripheral blood monocytes (PBMC) and polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells from blood samples collected from 28 culture-positive patients and over 80 non-infected patients used as controls.ResultsOur findings indicated that 18 of the 28 patients with bacteremia showed an increase of ≥ 3-fold in Rac1•GTP levels compared to the controls. The remaining ten patients with bacteremia exhibited either neutrophilia or pancytopenia and displayed normal to below-normal Rac1 GTPase activity, which is consistent with bacteria-induced immunosuppression. To analyze the data, we employed partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), a supervised method that optimizes group separation and aids in building a novel machine-learning model for pathogen identification.DiscussionThe results demonstrated that PLS-DA effectively differentiates between specific pathogen groups, and external validation confirmed the predictive model's utility. Given that bacterial culture confirmation may take several days, our study underscores the potential of combining routine assays with a machine-learning model as a valuable clinical decision-support tool. This approach could enable prompt and accurate treatment on the same day that patients present to the clinic.

## The DosR regulon of Mycobacterium avium and adaptation to hypoxia

date: 2025-02-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Like other tuberculous and nontuberculous mycobacterial pathogens of human lung such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. abscessus, M. avium is likely exposed to a variety of stressors during infection, including hypoxic conditions inside activated macrophages and in the avascular necrotic regions of granulomas. How M. avium survives hypoxic stress to establish a chronic infection is currently not well understood. Using RNA-sequencing, we here show that M. avium grown under progressive microaerophilic conditions activates more than 4-fold a subset of 16 genes, the expression of 13 of which is dependent on the two-component system regulator DosRS. A subset of M. avium DosR regulon genes was confirmed to also be activated upon exposure to nitric oxide. Although a second sensor kinase besides DosS has been proposed to function with the transcriptional regulator DosR in M. avium, we show that this other kinase cannot compensate for a deficiency in DosS. Loss of dosRS expression in M. avium led to a significant reduction in viability under hypoxia that was more marked at acidic than at neutral pH. Unlike the situation in M. abscessus, however, loss of DosRS did not significantly impact the ability of M. avium to establish a drug tolerant state in vitro or form biofilms under host relevant conditions. Collectively, these results are suggestive of a lesser impact of DosRS on the ability of M. avium to develop antibiotic tolerance compared to other nontuberculous mycobacteria. The M. avium dosRS mutant further showed no signs of virulence attenuation in murine macrophages and in chronically infected immunocompetent BALB/c mice.

## Application of microphysiological systems to unravel the mechanisms of schistosomiasis egg extravasation

date: 2025-02-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Despite decades of control efforts, the prevalence of schistosomiasis remains high in many endemic regions, posing significant challenges to global health. One of the key factors contributing to the persistence of the disease is the complex life cycle of the Schistosoma parasite, the causative agent, which involves multiple stages of development and intricate interactions with its mammalian hosts and snails. Among the various stages of the parasite lifecycle, the deposition of eggs and their migration through host tissues is significant, as they initiate the onset of the disease pathology by inducing inflammatory reactions and tissue damage. However, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying Schistosoma egg extravasation remains limited, hindering efforts to develop effective interventions. Microphysiological systems, particularly organ-on-a-chip systems, offer a promising approach to study this phenomenon in a controlled experimental setting because they allow the replication of physiological microenvironments in vitro. This review provides an overview of schistosomiasis, introduces the concept of organ-on-a-chip technology, and discusses its potential applications in the field of schistosomiasis research.

## Changes of metabolic parameters, antioxidant capacity, and gut microbiota in response to substitution of ferrous sulfate with iron hydroxy methionine analog chelate in weaned piglets

date: 2025-02-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionPrevious studies have suggested that dietary organic iron offers health advantages compared to its inorganic counterpart. However, the effects of iron hydroxy methionine analog chelate (Fe-HMA) supplementation in weaned piglets have not been fully explored. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of replacing ferrous sulfate with Fe-HMA as the iron source on serum biochemistry, antioxidant capacity, and gut microbiota in weaned piglets.MethodsOne hundred and twenty weaned piglets were randomly allocated to two treatment groups. Each group contained four replicates, with 15 pigs per replicate. Piglets were fed either 100 mg Fe/kg in the form of ferrous sulfate (Fe-sulfate group) or 50 mg Fe/kg in the form of Fe-HMA (Fe-HMA group) as the iron source for 28 days.Results and discussionResults showed that supplementing Fe-HMA as an iron source significantly increased the levels of triglycerides and glucose in portal venous serum, albumin in both serum and portal venous serum and decreased serum low-density lipoprotein level in weaned piglets. Additionally, Fe-HMA supplementation significantly reduced serum and liver malondialdehyde levels, while increasing catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), total superoxide dismutase, and manganese superoxide dismutase levels in serum, as well as GSH-Px and CAT levels in the liver. Moreover, Fe-HMA regulated the intestinal microbiota composition, notably increasing the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and decreasing microbes involved in aromatic_compound_degradation. In conclusion, dietary replacing inorganic iron with Fe-HMA improved metabolic parameters and antioxidant capacity, and regulated gut microbiota composition in weaned piglets.

## Reproductive tract microbiome dysbiosis associated with gynecological diseases

date: 2025-02-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Female health and the microbiota of the reproductive tract are closely associated. The research scope on reproductive tract microbiota extends from the vaginal to the upper reproductive tract and from infectious diseases to various benign and malignant gynecological and obstetrical diseases. The primary focus of this paper was to evaluate the most recent findings about the role of reproductive tract microbiota in gynecological diseases, including endometrial polyps, uterine fibroids, endometriosis, adenomyosis, endometrial hyperplasia, and endometrial carcinoma. Different stages of gynecological diseases have diverse microbiota in the female reproductive tract, and some specific bacteria may help the disease progress. For example, Fusobacterium may exacerbate endometriosis, while treatments that target microbiota, such as antibiotics, probiotics, and flora transplantation, showed some efficacy in the experiment. These findings indicate the wonderful prospect of this field. Additionally, we have discussed how microbiome research can improve our understanding of the interactions between reproductive tract microorganisms and hosts, aid in the screening and diagnosis of gynecological diseases, and direct the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies aimed at maintaining and restoring a healthy reproductive tract microbiota when combined with other technologies like transcriptome and proteome, in vitro cultured cells, and animal models.

## Multiomics insights into BMI-related intratumoral microbiota in gastric cancer

date: 2025-02-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionBody mass index (BMI) is considered an important factor in tumor prognosis, but its role in gastric cancer (GC) remains controversial. There is a lack of studies exploring the effect of BMI on gastric cancer from the perspective of intratumoral microbiota. This study aimed to compare and analyze the differences in and functions of intratumoral microbiota among GC patients with varying BMIs, aiming to ascertain whether specific microbial features are associated with prognosis in low-BMI (LBMI) gastric cancer patients.MethodsA retrospective analysis of the clinicopathological features and prognosis of 5567 patients with different BMIs was performed between January 2010 and December 2019. Tumor tissues from 189 GC patients were collected for 16S rRNA sequencing, 64 samples were selected for transcriptome sequencing, and 57 samples were selected for untargeted metabolomic analysis.ResultsClinical cohort analysis revealed that GC patients with a low BMI presented poorer clinical and pathological characteristics than those with a non-low-BMI (NLBMI). LBMI was identified as a significant independent risk factor for adverse prognosis, potentially exerting immunosuppressive effects on postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed no significant differences in the alpha and beta diversity of the intratumoral microbiota between the two groups of GC patients. However, LEfSe analysis revealed 32 differential intratumoral microbiota between the LBMI and NLBMI groups. Notably, the genus Abiotrophia was significantly enriched in the LBMI group. Further in-depth analysis indicated that the genus Abiotrophia was inversely associated with eosinophils, P2RY12, and SCN4B genes, and positively linked with LGR6 in LBMI gastric cancer patients. Metabolomic assessments revealed that LBMI was positively associated with purine metabolites, specifically guanine and inosine diphosphate (IDP).DiscussionIn conclusion, LBMI is an independent risk factor for poor prognosis in gastric cancer patients and may have an inhibitory effect on postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. Intratumor flora of gastric cancer patients with different BMI levels differed, with different immune cell infiltration and metabolic characteristics. The genus Abiotrophia may promote gastric cancer development and progression by regulating eosinophils and the purine metabolism pathway, which provides a new idea for the precise treatment of gastric cancer.

## Exploring the clinical outcomes and molecular characteristics of Acinetobacter baumannii bloodstream infections: a study of sequence types, capsular types, and drug resistance in China

date: 2025-02-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundBloodstream infections (BSIs) caused by Acinetobacter baumannii have been associated with high mortality. To improve the outcomes of patients, this study explored the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with BSIs, as well as the phenotypic and genomic characteristics of these isolates.MethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted involving A. baumannii BSIs cases from 2020 to 2023 in a tertiary hospital. The clinical characteristics of all A. baumannii isolates were evaluated. Virulence phenotypes of all isolates were evaluated using the growth curve, biofilm-forming assay, antiserum complement killing, and G.mellonella killing assay. Furthermore, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was utilized to analyze genomic characteristics.ResultsThe 30-day mortality rate of 67 patients with BSIs was 55.22%. Patients in the death group had significantly lower platelet counts and higher CRP levels than those in the survival group. Additionally, higher rates of antibiotic use (≥2 classes) and greater carbapenem exposure were observed. Among the isolates, CRAb accounted for 80.6%, ST2 accounted for 76.12%, and KL2/3/7/77/160 accounted for 65.67%. The predominant KL type was KL3, found in 19.4% of the isolates. All ST2 and KL2/3/7/77/160 isolates were CRAb. Among the isolates, 90.7% of the CRAb isolates coharbored blaOXA-23 and blaOXA-66, while one coharbored blaNDM-1 and blaOXA-23. Compared with non-ST2 and non KL2/3/7/77/160 infections, ST2 and KL2/3/7/77/160 infections had higher mortality rates (66.0% vs. 23.5%, P=0.002; 65.90% vs. 34.78%, P=0.015). Patients with ST2 and KL2/3/7/77/160 infections underwent more invasive procedures, received two or more antibiotics and carbapenem therapy before isolation, and had lower serum albumin levels. These isolates exhibited significantly higher resistance to antimicrobial agents. No significant differences in virulence phenotypes were observed between the two groups, except for biofilm formation between the ST2 and non-ST2 groups (P=0.002). However, these isolates harbored more virulence genes related to iron uptake and biofilm formation.ConclusionThe mortality rate associated with BSIs caused by A. baumannii is high. It is of great significance for clinicians to pay attention to the risk factors of the clinical characteristics of patients and to identify the ST and KL types of the strains causing the infection at an early stage.

## Distinct virulence of the microsporidian parasite in honey bees competing habitat

date: 2025-02-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

In natural ecosystems, parasites often infect multiple host species, particularly when hosts share habitats, facilitating host-to-host transmission and altering traditional host-parasite coevolution dynamics. This study examines the microsporidian parasite Nosema ceranae in Eastern honey bees (Apis cerana) and Western honey bees (Apis mellifera), assessing its virulence and proliferation dynamics. Using inoculation experiments, we measured bee mortality and parasite spore loads to infer virulence and proliferation. Additionally, time-series transcriptome analysis of both bees and parasites provide insights into host-pathogen interactions. The results reveal that N. ceranae produces more spores with lower mortality in A. mellifera but causes higher mortality with lower spore production in A. cerana. The parasite also suppresses host gene expression, with stronger suppression observed in A. cerana. These findings suggest that N. ceranae is adapted for low virulence and high proliferation in A. mellifera but exhibits high virulence and limited proliferation in A. cerana. This study highlights the evolution of distinct trade-offs between virulence and proliferation in a multi-host system, offering valuable insights into parasite-host dynamics and their ecological implications.

## Microbiome structure in healthy and pregnant women and importance of vaginal dysbiosis in spontaneous abortion

date: 2025-02-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The vaginal microbiome of healthy women is dominated by Lactobacillus spp. A variety of illnesses, such as vaginosis, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), failed implantation, premature birth (PTB), and preterm pre-labor membrane rupture, are brought on by an unbalanced microbiota. Pregnancy is associated with a decrease in the metabolic capacity of the vaginal resident microbiome, which is consistent with a change to a less complex Lactobacillus-dominated microbiome. Age, race, sexual intercourse, smoking, IUD, contraception, lifestyle, and diet all affect the makeup of the vaginal microbiome. Moreover, physiological events including menarche, the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, menopause, and other hormonal changes have an impact on the vaginal microbiome. The vaginal microbiome is significantly disrupted by the menstrual cycle, with significant changes toward a more varied microbiota occurring around menstruation. Several major factors maintain or disrupt the vaginal microbiome including ethnic group, menstruation cycle, and pregnancy which are discussed in this section. In the index pregnancy, the vaginal microbiota of women who had already given birth, or had just experienced an induced or spontaneous abortion, was qualitatively and quantitatively different from that of women who were having their first child. Early pregnancy vaginal microbiome depletion is a risk factor for early pregnancy miscarriage. Although, early pregnancy miscarriage is not always caused by a high bacterial diversity and quantity of lactobacilli. Lactobacillus protects against pathogens through the production of antibacterial compounds such as lactic acid and bacteriocins.

## Serology reveals comparable patterns in the transmission intensities of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax in Langkat district, North Sumatera Province, Indonesia

date: 2025-02-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe incidence of malaria in Indonesia has declined significantly over the last few decades. Thus, a demand for more sensitive techniques to describe low levels of transmission in the country is important. This study was conducted to evaluate antibody response to Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax in an area nearing elimination in North Sumatera Province, Indonesia.MethodsA cross-sectional survey was conducted in Langkat district, North Sumatera Province, in June 2019. Basic demographic data and filter paper blood spots were collected from 339 participants. Antibody responses to two P. falciparum (PfAMA-1 and PfMSP-119) and two P. vivax (PvAMA-1 and PvMSP-119) antigens were measured using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Seroconversion rates (SCR) were estimated by fitting a simple reversible catalytic model to seroprevalence data for each antibody. Multiple logistic regression was used to investigate factors associated with exposure.ResultsThe overall malaria seroprevalence was 10.6% for PfAMA-1, 13% for PfMSP-119, 18.6% for PvAMA-1, and 7.4% for PvMSP-119. Seropositive individuals for P. falciparum (PfAMA-1/PfMSP-119) and P. vivax (PvAMA-1/PvMSP-119) were similar at 20.7%, with no significant differences observed between age groups (p > 0.05). Based on the reversible catalytic model, the calculated SCRs indicated a higher level of P. falciparum transmission than P. vivax using all tested antigens. In the adjusted model, only spending nights in the forest was associated with P. vivax seropositivity (odd ratio: 3.93, p < 0.001).ConclusionThe analysis of community-based serological data helps describe the similar levels of P. falciparum and P. vivax transmission in the Langkat district. The use of a serological approach enhances the detection of past exposure, aiding in the identification of epidemiological risk factors and malaria surveillance in low transmission settings in Indonesia.

## Immunological memory to COVID-19 vaccines in immunocompromised and immunocompetent children

date: 2025-02-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundMost children in Argentina received only the initial COVID-19 vaccine series, with presumed hybrid immunity after multiple Omicron waves. However, the durability of immune memory, particularly in immunocompromised (IC) children, remains poorly studied.MethodsA cohort of IC (n=45) and healthy children (HC, n=79) was assessed between 13 to 17 months after receiving two or three doses of BBIBP-CorV and/or BNT162b2. Plasma anti-spike IgG, neutralizing activity and antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells against Wuhan and Omicron BA.5 variants were assessed.ResultsMost children remained seropositive after two vaccine doses, but compared with HC, IC exhibited lower neutralizing titers against both Wuhan and Omicron BA.5, particularly those vaccinated with BBIBP-CorV. Even after three vaccine doses, IC showed weaker neutralizing antibody response, CD8+ T cell responses and lower IFN-γ production compared with HC. Integrated analysis of neutralizing antibodies, memory CD4+, and CD8+ T cells revealed a weak immune memory among IC with an important compromise in memory CD8+ T cell responses.ConclusionsImmunity can last up to 17 months, but reduced effectiveness against new variants highlights the need for updated COVID-19 vaccines, especially for IC children. Additional efforts are essential to enhance vaccination coverage and protect this vulnerable population.

## P1 adhesin genotype characteristics of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in China from 2017 to 2019

date: 2025-02-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionMycoplasma pneumoniae is one of the important pathogens of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and P1 adhesin serves as a pathogenic protein and an immune protein involved in the pathogenesis of mycoplasma pneumoniae. The aim of this study was to investigate the P1 adhesin genotype in Mycoplasma pneumoniae and its association with disease severity in patients with CAP from 2017 to 2019.MethodsM. pneumoniae was identified in patient samples by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The P1 genotypes of samples were determined using a culture-independent P1 typing method.ResultsIn total, 1,907 clinical samples were collected from 13 tertiary hospitals in Beijing, Shenyang, and Baotou, including 1488 samples from children and 419 from adults. Of these, 820 samples (43.00%), including 777 from children and 43 from adults, were positive for M. pneumoniae. 797 samples were successfully typed using the culture-independent P1 typing method (P1-1, 605; P1- 2, 192). The M. pneumoniae detection rate and P1-1 detection rate differed significantly between children and adults (both p < 0.01), with P1-1 remaining the dominant genotype. The proportion of P1-2 samples increased in children from 16.75% in 2017 to 28.76% in 2019.DiscussionNo relationship between the P1 genotype and disease severity was identified. Monitoring the genotype changes of P1 adhesin in local populations may positively impact the epidemiological prevention and control of M. pneumoniae infections.

## Assessing mutation accumulation in DNA repair-deficient Listeria monocytogenes: implications for cgMLST cluster thresholds in outbreak analysis

date: 2025-02-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundListeria (L.) monocytogenes is primarily transmitted via contaminated food and can cause listeriosis, an infection often associated with sepsis and meningitis in at-risk individuals. Accurate outbreak detection relies on whole genome sequencing (WGS) and core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST), which use allele thresholds to identify related strains.MethodsThis study investigated mutation rates in L. monocytogenes, focusing on isolates with DNA repair deficiencies. Serial subcultivations were performed, comparing a repair-deficient isolate with a wild-type control. Genetic variability was assessed using WGS and cgMLST.ResultsMutation rates were significantly higher in repair-deficient isolates, exceeding typical cgMLST thresholds currently used in Listeria outbreak investigations, leading to a misclassification of related isolates as unrelated. An additional analysis of the Austrian Listeria database revealed that such deficiencies are rare among isolates.ConclusionsThe standard 7-allele cgMLST threshold effectively identifies related strains in most cases, but may require adjustments for hypermutator strains. Incorporating DNA repair data could improve the accuracy of outbreak investigations, ensuring reliable public health responses.
