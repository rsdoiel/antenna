gut microbiota and metabolomic profiles in HBV-related liver cirrhosis:
insights into disease progression</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundHepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver cirrhosis (HBV-LC) is
a significant global health issue, affecting gut microbiota (GM)
composition and metabolic processes. This study aimed to explore the
associations between intestinal microbiota, metabolic profiles, and
disease progression in patients with HBV-LC.MethodsFecal samples were
collected prospectively from 40 healthy controls (HC) and 83 HBV-LC
patients between December 2022 and August 2023. Gut microbiota
alterations at various stages of liver function were analyzed using 16S
rRNA gene sequencing. Untargeted metabolomics was employed to identify
potential biomarkers and metabolic pathways associated with early
cirrhosis. Additionally, correlations between bacterial genera,
inflammatory markers, and metabolites were investigated.ResultsHBV-LC
patients demonstrated a significant reduction in bacterial diversity and
relative abundance compared to the HC group. Genera such as Alistipes
and Lachnospira were notably depleted, while Fusobacterium and
Enterococcus were enriched in patients with Model for End-Stage Liver
Disease (MELD) scores ≥ 21 or Child-Turcotte-Pugh C grade. Correlation
analyses revealed strong associations between intestinal flora, clinical
indicators of disease severity, and inflammatory factors. Metabolic
analysis showed decreased levels of tocopherol and
21-hydroxypregnenolone, which were strongly linked to the reduced
abundance of Alistipes and Lachnospira. Biosynthesis of unsaturated
fatty acids and linoleic acid metabolism emerged as critical enrichment
pathways.ConclusionsHBV-LC patients displayed significant alterations in
gut microbiota and fecal metabolites, which correlated closely with
disease severity and inflammatory status. These findings provide new
insights into cirrhosis pathogenesis and suggest potential biomarkers
for early diagnosis and disease monitoring.</p>

situ identification of toxin-producing Clostridioides difficile in stool
samples based on single-cell Raman spectroscopy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Clostridioides difficile (CD) has emerged as one of the most
prevalent nosocomial infections in hospitals and is the primary
causative agent of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous
colitis. In recent years, C. difficile-induced infections have resulted
in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, with a particularly
rapid increase in incidence observed in China. C. difficile strains are
categorized into toxin-producing and non-toxin-producing based on their
ability to synthesize toxins, with the pathogenicity of C. difficile
being strictly dependent on the protein toxins produced by the
toxin-producing strains. Therefore, early and rapid identification of
toxin-producing C. difficile is crucial for the diagnosis and prevention
of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Currently, the detection
methods of C. difficile infection carried out by clinical laboratories
in China mainly include C. difficile toxin-producing culture, cell
culture toxin assay, toxin assay by immunological methods, glutamate
dehydrogenase (GDH) assay and nucleic acid amplification assay.However,
current detection methods for CDI in clinical laboratories in China
exhibit significant limitations, such as being time-consuming,
operationally complex, and lacking in specificity and sensitivity. Raman
microspectroscopy has been shown to have the potential for rapid and
reliable identification in microbial diagnostics, with the method
reducing the time to results to less than 1 hour, including the
processing of clinical samples, the measurement of single-cell Raman
spectra, and the final diagnosis through the use of training models. In
this study, we aimed to predict in situ strain identification and
virulent strain identification of 24 raw clinical stool samples by
constructing a reference single-cell Raman spectroscopy (SCRS) database
of common intestinal flora and C. difficile, as well as a reference SCRS
database of toxin-producing and non-toxin-producing C. difficile
strains. The results showed that the accuracy of C. difficile strain
identification in clinical stool samples was 83%, and the accuracy of
virulent strain prediction was 80%. These findings suggest that Raman
spectroscopy may be a viable method for the rapid in situ identification
of virulent and non-virulent C. difficile strains and holds promise for
clinical application in the rapid diagnosis of CDI.</p>

features and management of postoperative lumbar intervertebral space
infections following spinal endoscopy: a retrospective analysis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundPostoperative lumbar intervertebral space infections
following spinal endoscopy are infrequent but severe complications that
can markedly affect patient recovery and treatment outcomes. Early
diagnosis remains challenging due to the nonspecific nature of clinical
symptoms. This study aims to identify the clinical characteristics, risk
factors, and effective diagnostic and treatment strategies for
postoperative intervertebral space infections.MethodsA retrospective
analysis was conducted on 14 cases of postoperative intervertebral space
infections following spinal endoscopy. The data set included patient
demographics, clinical symptoms, imaging findings, blood culture
results, and treatment approaches. The analysis assessed early diagnosis
and treatment outcomes concerning the infection’s progression and the
use of MRI, inflammatory markers, and empirical antibiotics.ResultsThe
most common clinical symptoms included localized back pain, neurological
deficits, and fever, though these lacked specificity. MRI proved
valuable in diagnosing early infections. The majority of cases exhibited
elevated levels of inflammatory markers, such as CRP and ESR. The
treatment plan included early surgical intervention with debridement and
internal fixation, along with extended antibiotic therapy.ConclusionThe
early identification and intervention of postoperative intervertebral
space infections following spinal endoscopy are of critical importance.
The implementation of a strict aseptic technique, the execution of
careful preoperative planning, and the timely use of MRI for diagnosis
are essential to the prevention and effective treatment of these
infections. This study underscores the necessity of a comprehensive
approach to minimize the risk of postoperative intervertebral space
infections and to enhance patient outcomes.</p>

urine cultures: reconciling contamination with the urobiome while
recognizing the pathogens</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Polymicrobial or mixed urine cultures of more than one predominant
microbe confound clinical urinary tract infection diagnosis. The current
College of American Pathologists clinical laboratory standard states
that a urine sample cultured with more than two isolates with &gt;10,000
colony forming units/ml is to be considered contaminated. However, the
presence of urinary sample bacteria in individuals without urinary
symptoms (referred to as asymptomatic bacteriuria) is common especially
in older people and in pregnant individuals. Furthermore, the discovery
of an indigenous urinary microbiome (urobiome) in healthy humans
throughout life from shortly after birth to death conflicts with the
long-standing notion that urine derived from sterile filtered blood
should be sterile above the urethral sphincter. Polymicrobial infections
are not consistent with Koch’s postulates that a single pathogen is
causal for disease. In this review, we will discuss current standards of
contamination, how to reconcile the sterility of urine with the
existence of the urobiome, a history of polymicrobial infections, and
why re-examining current practices is essential for the practice of
medicine, improving quality of life, and potentially saving lives. </p>

3-year retrospective analysis of microbial species and key biomarkers
associated with wound infections in Shantou Hospital, China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-19, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>A biomarker is an important indicator of a normal physiological or
pathological process, or a pharmacological response to a therapeutic
intervention. This retrospective study aimed to measure blood biomarkers
in wound patients, identify the microorganisms responsible for wound
infections and determine their drug susceptibility patterns at a
tertiary care hospital in China. The study was conducted between 2022
and 2024, including 279 patients. A total of 33 microbial species were
isolated using culture techniques, identified, and analyzed for their
antibiotic susceptibility. The organisms were predominantly
gram-positive (50.8%), with Staphylococcus aureus (80.2%) being the most
prevalent species. Among the gram-negative bacteria (41.2%), Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (22.6%) was the most predominant species. Biomarkers such as
white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (ESR) values were higher than normal in most of
microbial species associated with wound infections. The WBC value in
gram-positive infections and the neutrophil and ESR values in fungal
infections were statistically significantly higher than the normal range
(p = 0.0002, p = 0.002, and p = 0.003, respectively). Albumin levels
were high value in P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae (0.48 and 0.56
respectively), while lymphocytes levels were the lowest value (-0.62) in
S. aureus. Resistance to at least one antibiotic was identified in 82.4%
of the isolates. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant microbes in
different wound infections is a significant concern in China. A health
awareness campaign, coupled with improved hygiene measures, should be
implemented to prevent the spread of microorganisms responsible for
wound infections within the community.</p>
