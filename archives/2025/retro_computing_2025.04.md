## CardInfo 1.01 and Currency 2.06 from KevSoft

date: 2025-01-31, from: RiscOS Story

Kevin Wells has updated two of his handy applications that use Wget to relay information back and forth to remote APIs (application programmer interfaces), allowing RISC OS users to access, lookup, and retrieve information from the desktop. The first of the updates was to CardInfo, the initial release of which came back in October 2024. The purpose of the software is to look up information about everyone&#8217;s flexible friend1 &#8211; the plastic in your wallet. Given the first six digits of a bank card number, CardInfo will communicate with BIN&#8230;

## ToggleBD 2.00 now available

date: 2025-01-31, from: RiscOS Story

Fred Graute has released version 2.00 of his Pinboard support module, ToggleBD, which can be used to raise the background of your desktop to the top of the window stack &#8211; effectively bringing it to the front of the display, with any open windows behind it &#8211; so that you can access anything pinned to it, such as iconised windows, shortcuts to files, and so on. Once you&#8217;ve got at what you need, the backdrop can be lowered again so that all your open windows can be accessed as normal.&#8230;

## JWasm 2.19

date: 2025-01-27, from: FreeDOS News

<div class="markdown_content"><p>If you're following along with the latest development tools, you may be interested in JWasm, a MASM-compatible assembler. Version 2.19 was released today and includes several bugfixes and other changes. A few highlights: format mz: stack segment was never written, format mz,pe: start offset for first segment may have resulted in an invalid binary, write listing reworked, PUSHW will emit warning "magnitude of offset exceeds 16-bit" if operand is a 32-bit offset, and using 'option oldmacros' will cause a warning only. You can find it at <a class="" href="https://github.com/Baron-von-Riedesel/JWasm" rel="nofollow">JWasm on GitHub</a>, under <a class="" href="https://github.com/Baron-von-Riedesel/JWasm/releases/tag/v2.19" rel="nofollow">release v2.19</a>.
