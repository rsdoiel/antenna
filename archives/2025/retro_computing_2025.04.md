## Zerofill 2.01

date: 2025-01-30, from: FreeDOS News

<div class="markdown_content"><p>Zerofill writes zeros on the empty disk space for the selected drive. It can help virtual machine and disk compression software to better compact the allocated space in the volume, and so on, reducing its disk usage. Javier has released Zerofill 2.01 with several new features: + Support extended FAT32 drives with 7305 DOS service if available + Increased speed by generating temporary 1GB files (instead of 500MB files as in previous version) + Changed temporary file naming convention + Added a question to confirm deletion of temporary files + other smaller code updates. You can find it on the <a class="" href="https://nikkhokkho.sourceforge.io/?page=ZEROFILL" rel="nofollow">Zerofill web page</a>.</p></div>

## JWasm 2.19

date: 2025-01-27, from: FreeDOS News

<div class="markdown_content"><p>If you're following along with the latest development tools, you may be interested in JWasm, a MASM-compatible assembler. Version 2.19 was released today and includes several bugfixes and other changes. A few highlights: format mz: stack segment was never written, format mz,pe: start offset for first segment may have resulted in an invalid binary, write listing reworked, PUSHW will emit warning "magnitude of offset exceeds 16-bit" if operand is a 32-bit offset, and using 'option oldmacros' will cause a warning only. You can find it at <a class="" href="https://github.com/Baron-von-Riedesel/JWasm" rel="nofollow">JWasm on GitHub</a>, under <a class="" href="https://github.com/Baron-von-Riedesel/JWasm/releases/tag/v2.19" rel="nofollow">release v2.19</a>.
