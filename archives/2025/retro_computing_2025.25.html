<p>date: 2025-06-23, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>Or play audio of any kind, really The Hydra computer range from
R-Comp Interactive is so named because, like the creature of Greek myth,
it is multi-headed – it’s a computer that can hold up to six Raspberry
Pi-based boards, each running its own OS, and all concurrently. Being
from R-Comp, it’s a RISC OS computer first and foremost – that’s the
operating system running on the ‘first’ head, while any of the others
that are in use (the full six don’t have to be enabled) would most
likely be…</p>

Mac G5 to “See” a SATA III HDD</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-22, from: Happy Macs site</p>
<p>Many of you may have revived or upgraded a Power Mac G5 (any of the
models, all the way up through the G5 Quad). You purchased a shiny new

<p>The Achilles heel of most late 2005 Power Mac G5 Quads is the Liquid
