&#8220;Artisan Geometry&#8221; is the overarching term used to describe the design approach in the five Lost Art Press books by Jim Tolpin and George Walker. We often get asked to explain it, and to recommend one or more of their books with which to get started. We decided those questions would be better answered by...

## Bob Flexner, 1940-2024

date: 2025-03-16, from: Lost Arg Press blog

I recently learned my finishing mentor – likely he was yours, too – and friend Bob Flexner died at home on December 29, 2024 (read his obituary here). Bob was perhaps best-known for the book &#8220;Understanding Wood Finishing,&#8221; recognized by many as the bible of all things finishing, and as the long-time finishing columnist for...
