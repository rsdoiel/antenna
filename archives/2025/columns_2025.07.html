<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
If I were in charge of marketing for the Democrats: 1. I’d restart the
online channel that Kamala Harris had that was shut down on Election
Day. 2. I’d get out the message over and over about how things are going
too fast, we need to slow it down, so we can consider what’s happening.
Who? The people. I know this will resonate with almost everyone in the
US, no matter who they voted for. Stop I want to know how these changes
will help or hurt me, my family, community. For Trump voters, it was fun
to make my statement, but I’m afraid this is going too far. I think we
can all relate to that. We aren’t being represented here.
</p>
<p>
I asked <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Google Gemini</a> to
visualize what it feels like to be watching what’s happening in the US
from inside the US. This came close to capturing it, but it could have
expressed the fear of it more clearly. Slow down, please, let us figure
out what you’re doing.

I was about to post a complain about swift concurrency and the more I
twisted myself into a pretzel the less aware I was of a thread misuse I
was attempting.
</p>
<p>
I was working extra hard to attempt to use a thread bound API from the
wrong thread.

<p>
In practice this would have crashed.

<p>BTW, no one thought much about the threading structure we use on
Bluesky. As far as I can tell it was copied from Twitter. It’s not a
very good structure. It encourages spam and abuse. You gotta wonder if
the threading structure had evolved, or if there were more competition,
different approaches to see what would happen, we might have avoided our
meltdown with a better design.</p>

doesn’t often indulge in that kind of humor. I imagine they must’ve had

do. It has never happened before. But it has happened now, and the group

them? Is that correct? What comes next?</p>
