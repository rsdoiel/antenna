<p>Is there some magic making three times, or even pi, the number of

about? Let’s rewind and start with talking about writing code. Let’s say
you start out by writing a program that is exactly one hundred lines

birthday on February 22, 1732, but also traditionally including Abraham
Lincoln, who was born on February 12, 1809.</p>

<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
One of the not-good things about Mastodon is that you can’t moderate
comments under your own posts.
</p>
<p>
If someone says something abusive, it’s there for everyone to see,
forever.
</p>
<p>
I’ve come to value the feature in Facebook that gives the author full
discretion over what comments remain, to head off bad vibes.
</p>
<p>
I think of a post I write as my house, and I want people who visit to
feel respected.
</p>
<p>
A turd in the middle of the living room is not respectful.

<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
A simple idea, a quid pro quo.
</p>
<p>
If we want Democrats to support the Constitution, we have to demonstrate
that we will support them.
</p>
<p>
We are the government of the US, Congress represents us.
</p>
<p>
We have been too passive.
</p>
<p>
But then, they have to include us in governing.
</p>
<p>
No more shutting off the connection after the election.
</p>
<p>
Seems like a fair deal.

<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
If I were in charge of marketing for the Democrats: 1. I’d restart the
online channel that Kamala Harris had that was shut down on Election
Day. 2. I’d get out the message over and over about how things are going
too fast, we need to slow it down, so we can consider what’s happening.
Who? The people. I know this will resonate with almost everyone in the
US, no matter who they voted for. Stop I want to know how these changes
will help or hurt me, my family, community. For Trump voters, it was fun
to make my statement, but I’m afraid this is going too far. I think we
can all relate to that. We aren’t being represented here.
</p>
<p>
I asked <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Google Gemini</a> to
visualize what it feels like to be watching what’s happening in the US
from inside the US. This came close to capturing it, but it could have
expressed the fear of it more clearly. Slow down, please, let us figure
out what you’re doing.

<p>We’re diving head first into a world run by AI bots, before we’ve
even begun to understand how to use them.</p>

<p>BTW, no one thought much about the threading structure we use on
Bluesky. As far as I can tell it was copied from Twitter. It’s not a
very good structure. It encourages spam and abuse. You gotta wonder if
the threading structure had evolved, or if there were more competition,
different approaches to see what would happen, we might have avoided our
meltdown with a better design.</p>

<p>Great quote from a
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=severance+s2e5">favorite
show</a>. “He put the dick in contradiction.” This is a show that
doesn’t often indulge in that kind of humor. I imagine they must’ve had
a great time with it in the writer’s room. Or was it ad-lib’d? And wtf
does it mean?</p>

idea of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-coup">coup</a> in
the US is one we all presumably have a hard time thinking about. I sure
do. It has never happened before. But it has happened now, and the group
that is governing is doing it illegally, and is dismantling the country
as quickly as they can, assuming someone will at some point try to stop
them? Is that correct? What comes next?</p>

<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: Daniel Stenberg Blog</p>
<p>But will it satisfy the world? I have blogged several times in the
past about how OpenSSL decided to not ship the API for QUIC a long time

and thereby …

Republicans alike—agreed that the federal government should regulate
business, provide a basic social safety net, promote infrastructure, and
protect civil rights.</p>
