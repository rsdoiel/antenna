Had an eye test today and ordered new glasses üôå I‚Äôm excited to no
longer suffer from glasses that are just too big for my tiny little head
and keep on sliding down my nose‚Ä¶ over and over again all day every day.
I think the new pair literally has a kids‚Äô frame but if it fits, it
fits!
</p>
<p>
My left eye is unchanged (same degree of short-sighted) from last time
but my right eye is now long-sighted and more astigmatic ü´† Like, can‚Äôt
my eyes just take the average or something? Why do they do this to me.

multiple network interfaces at once in Linux with iperf3</h2>

<p><span
class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Benchmarking
multiple network interfaces at once in Linux with iperf3</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;Recently, I&#39;ve been working on a Pi router build with multiple 2.5 Gbps Ethernet ports using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/647&quot;&gt;Radxa&#39;s Dual 2.5G Router HAT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
I wanted a simple way to check on total network TCP throughput using
<em>both</em> interfaces (or really, as many interfaces as possible) to
multiple computers on my network, and I noticed <code>iperf3</code>‚Äôs
<code>‚Äìbind</code> option (like <code>‚Äìbind [ip address of
interface]</code>) was not splitting the traffic on both interfaces‚Äîit
would just route all traffic through one!
</p>
<p>
Luckily, I found the issue
<a href="https://github.com/esnet/iperf/issues/1572">Failing to bind to
interface when multiple interfaces are present</a>, and in it, <span
class="citation" data-cites="bmah888">@bmah888</span> mentioned the
<code>‚Äìbind-dev</code> option, which is new as of iperf 3.10+.
</p>
<p>
Using that option (like <code>‚Äìbind-dev [interface name]</code>), you
can force an instance of iperf3 to bind to one particular device. For
example, assuming I have two servers on my network running <code>iperf3
-s</code>, I can run the following on the Pi to saturate both
connections as much as the Pi will allow:

<p>Hi Folks:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><a

<h2 id="day-3-of-wordland">Day 3 of WordLand</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
This started out as a post on the support group, but it became a post
that needed to be on the blog.
</p>
<p>
The groundrules here are ‚Äì if you see a problem in the support group and
you can help with it, please give it a try and speak up.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs important to develop a community here if the
<a href="https://wordland.social/">product</a> is going to gain users,
and become solid for all people and achieve all its potential for
blazing a new trail. If it‚Äôs just me, the results are predictable and
not good ‚Äì I‚Äôm one old man here, with limited capability. The product
still has issues, so there is still plenty of work to do, but I think
the result will be worth it.
</p>
<p>
The goal is to bootstrap something new ‚Äì a social network without all
the problems of Twitter et al.¬†Ultimately the limits they impose on
writers are unacceptable. I‚Äôve waited for them to fix these problems for
18 years now, and I‚Äôve come to see, amazingly, they don‚Äôt see them as
problems. They are happy to have writers paste images of their writing
instead of the words themselves. Or break their writing up into
300-character chunks that are basically impossible to read and a bitch
to write. And no titles, no editing, no style, no links. And they call
it the web? (End of editorial.)
</p>
<p>
If this works, it will blaze a trail for new products on both sides,
reading and writing. We‚Äôve got reading covered from a technical
standpoint with FeedLand, and some good UI, I want to integrate them
with WordLand. And, as with everything based on RSS, you can replace my
stuff with others, <i>easily.</i> Unlike the twitter-like systems, which
are monolithic, and rely on federation (which imho doesn‚Äôt actually
work) to make it possible for components to be replaced. They should
have all started with RSS and slowly and carefully added features
without sacrificing the replaceability of components. Instead they
decided, imho unwisely, to try to reinvent RSS. The result is confusion
and stagnation.
</p>
<p>
I would also like to encourage people with WordPress experience to help
come up with a template that accomadates WordLand sites in a canonical
form. Makes sure WL‚Äôs idea of a category is a good match with WP‚Äôs. I am
a very casual WordPress user as you can see from
<a href="https://daveverse.wordpress.com/">my test site</a>. I like the
template, but it has errors in it. I don‚Äôt plan on becoming a WordPress
expert, there are so many of you, and I have my plate full with all
kinds of other stuff where I‚Äôm the only expert.
</p>
<p>
I chose WordPress for the same reason I chose MP3 and XML for podcasting
in 2001. There‚Äôs absolutely no question it‚Äôs the consensus platform for
web publishing. There are others, but the one that‚Äôs most deeply
installed is WordPress. So many people know how to make it work. It‚Äôs a
20+ year thing, and they‚Äôve done an <i>excellent</i> job of maintaining
compatibility. Stuff we developed that worked with WordPress in the 00s
still works today. That probably has a lot to do with it being the
consensus.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it‚Äôs encouraging to see how many people are trying WordLand. Now
I expect there will be lots of problem reports. It‚Äôs an important time
when help is needed.
</p>
<p>
Dave

I think it is hard for new users to find their bearings in Godot in the
"Create Node" UI.
</p>
<p>
I figured I could give some structure and direction by changing it a
bit. So I am going to default to this new version, and let power users
switch to the original one.
</p>
<p>
My only caveat is how shrunk the text feels.

<p>date: 2025-02-22, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
As the weather in Texas flip-flops weekly between sunny Spring and snowy
Winter, I‚Äôve been dealing with a bit of personal health this last
quarter. From my ADHD diagnosis, to trying meds for the first time, to
back-to-back sicknesses, then constant migraines, and then I think I got
the Norovirus on New Years. A debilitating time for me, but in January
it started to turn around when I got some good news‚Ä¶
</p>
<h2>
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a tumor, it‚Äôs a deformity‚Äù
</h2>
<p>
In December I saw my primary care physician about a pain in my ankle
that was causing me to hobble and at times preventing me from walking in
November. It caused a lot of other issues as well; a fire-like pain in
my thigh and a bump on my heel.
</p>
<p>
My doctor thought it might be
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondroma">Chondroma</a>, which
is a bit scary to look up, but is like a tumor made of cartilage. That
tumor can either be on the surface of the bone or inside the bone.
Yikes. I got an x-ray and followed up with an orthopedic surgeon who
gave me some good news that it‚Äôs not a tumor, but
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haglund%27s_syndrome">Haglund‚Äôs
Deformity</a> also known as ‚Äúpump bump‚Äù because a lot of women who wear
heels often get it. The pain comes and goes based on how the tendon rubs
against the bone spur.
</p>
<p>
Because I‚Äôm not in pain right now, the plan now is to take a
non-surgical path and use anti-inflammatories to keep it at bay, saving
surgery as a Plan B.
</p>
<h2>
The side effects of ADHD meds
</h2>
<p>
Last time I said I started on Qelbree, a non-stimulant ADHD medication.
Non-stimulants take about five days to build up, so there‚Äôs no lightning
bolt moment of clarity with non-stimulants that others describe when
taking Adderall or Ritalin. It‚Äôs hard to know if it‚Äôs working, but in
time I started to feel the effects.
</p>
<p>
The most notable one was that I was almost immune to environmental
triggers like clutter and noise that overwhelm me. Whenever I
encountered a mundane task like take out the trash or wash the dishes, I
found it a lot easier to pick up and do without a 30-minute prep talk
with my brain. That part was great‚Ä¶ the side effects though‚Ä¶ not so
great‚Ä¶
</p>
<p>
One of Qelbree‚Äôs listed side effects is insomnia. Sure enough, I‚Äôd wake
up every night at 2 AM and be awake for hours. Not quite night-brain
anxiety, but just‚Ä¶ fully awake. To combat this I read the first four
books of the Murderbot Diaries back-to-back. If life hands you lemons,
make emo robot lemonade.
</p>
<p>
The insomnia wasn‚Äôt great and I was having horrific headaches, so I
switched to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomoxetine">Atomoxetine</a>,
another non-stimulant SNRI that‚Äôs more common. My insurance also said
they weren‚Äôt going to pay for Qelbree, so that worked out. The also
don‚Äôt pay for atomoxetine, but it‚Äôs 10x cheaper so‚Ä¶ I guess that‚Äôs a
good deal? Lol.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôd say ‚Äúthe mox‚Äù ‚Äìthat‚Äôs what we, the moxxers, call it‚Äì is working
evident by the fact that I‚Äôve been able to focus on some long mundane
tasks at work. That‚Äôs been helpful. But it‚Äôs not without its side
effects either. Weight loss is a welcomed side effect (-5 lbs) but
another side effect is extreme dry mouth. My mouth is dry, y‚Äôall ‚Äìhow
dry is it?‚Äì my mouth is so dry I‚Äôm putting lotion on my gums. My dentist
said I need to buy that gel old people use to keep my mouth moisturized.
</p>
<p>
I guess I‚Äôve been lucky in my life thus far because this is my first
time navigating meds and side effects. What I‚Äôd like to avoid is taking
more meds to counter meds, although my gum lotion already crosses that
line.
</p>
<h2>
The rest of the story
</h2>
<p>
This has been a candid personal health issue of Vibe Check magazine.
Behind the scenes it‚Äôs been less adventurous. A busy new year at work as
my team sprints to deliver an ‚Äúintra-source‚Äù design systems project. It
‚Äìand the 1,000 token sidecar project‚Äì have consumed a lot of my brain
and time.
</p>
<p>
My daughter‚Äôs mid-way through her competitive cheer season. I‚Äôm not the
most extreme cheer dad, but I‚Äôm a proud one. Cheer has a lot of
cross-over with child beauty pageants, but it‚Äôs a team sport where kids
do flips. And it costs about 5-figures a year.
</p>
<p>
Hoping this bad health spat is over for now ‚Äìhe says as an ominous storm
cloud appears above my head‚Äì and I can start employing my hands and
brain to do more interesting tasks.

I started drafting a blog post on Marxist-feminism, but I feel like it‚Äôs
going to take me forever to finish because (ironically‚Ä¶) I am so flat
out with housework and baby care that I have no goddamn time to work on
it.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs funny, now the weekend is here, I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúYessss!! Vivian doesn‚Äôt
have work, so he can look after the baby while I‚Ä¶ get on top of the
housework.‚Äù üòñ

Cryptography in AI Systems</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-21, updated: 2025-02-21, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Interesting research: ‚Äú<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/288">How to
Securely Implement Cryptography in Deep Neural Networks</a>.‚Äù
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b> The wide adoption of deep neural networks (DNNs) raises
the question of how can we equip them with a desired cryptographic
functionality (e.g, to decrypt an encrypted input, to verify that this
input is authorized, or to hide a secure watermark in the output). The
problem is that cryptographic primitives are typically designed to run
on digital computers that use Boolean gates to map sequences of bits to
sequences of bits, whereas DNNs are a special type of analog computer
that uses linear mappings and ReLUs to map vectors of real numbers to
vectors of real numbers. This discrepancy between the discrete and
continuous computational models raises the question of what is the best
way to implement standard cryptographic primitives as DNNs, and whether
DNN implementations of secure cryptosystems remain secure in the new
setting, in which an attacker can ask the DNN to process a message whose
‚Äúbits‚Äù are arbitrary real numbers‚Ä¶

<h2 id="who-is-elon-musk">Who is Elon Musk?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-21, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
Journalism is as usual writing news they could have written last year
and should have if they weren‚Äôt dreaming that somehow we‚Äôd escape End of
Democracy 2.0. And we know how that turned out, about the same as
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Hillary%27s%20Emails%22">Hillary‚Äôs
Emails</a>.
</p>
<p>
Who is Elon Musk? Until I read his
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk">Wikipedia profile</a>
last week, I only had a vague idea. I wanted to know if he was actually
raised in South Africa, when he left, and what influence it had on him.
I‚Äôll let you read the article. We should be examining every nook and
cranny of who this unelected guy who never was in a debate, or won a
primary or an election, or had his background investigated, and remains
untouched by any kind of examination.
</p>
<p>
His security detail was just
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/20/politics/elon-musk-private-security-deputized-marshals-service/index.html">deputized</a>
by the <a href="https://www.usmarshals.gov/">US Marshals Service</a>.
What next? Maybe they‚Äôll just give him control of the military and get
on with it. You can see that‚Äôs coming, maybe in March, or sooner.
</p>
<p>
Do you think he‚Äôd have any
<a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/compunction">compunction</a>
against using the military against Americans? This isn‚Äôt his country. So
Americans probably mean nothing special to him. Since we played a role
in the overthrow of their apartheid, probably the opposite. I wonder who
or what he cares about. Has he ever answered a question without
deflecting? Is there any reporter who could or would interview him?
</p>
<p>
If journalism were really doing their job seriously, they would report
on this because this is what we‚Äôre thinking. When will jouralism get
that they are one of us, not above us? The sooner that light goes on,
the better.
</p>
<p>
Here‚Äôs a good story for one of fierce courageous reporters at the NY
Times. Who should be more scared of what‚Äôs coming? Blacks or Jews?

help? Nah I think it‚Äôs all for him, with a taste going to the Trump and
Putin families. He‚Äôs going to use his new power to buy something else.

<h2 id="complying-with-the-online-safety-act">Complying with the Online
Safety Act</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-21, from: Shady Characters blog</p>
<p>
In October 2023, the <abbr class="initialism">UK</abbr> government
passed into law the
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer">Online
Safety Act</a>, a set of regulations intended to make online services
more responsible for the content they carry. It is a laudable aim, but
unfortunately the distinctions the Act draws between large sites such as
Facebook and Google and smaller sites such as this one are
insufficiently well defined. The upshot is that complying with the Act
places a much larger burden on the owners of sites such as <cite>Shady
Characters</cite> than it does on the owners of those larger sites.

<h1 id="2025-02-19-bots-again-cursed">
2025-02-19 Bots again, cursed
</h1>
<p>
I‚Äôm on a trip and once again the bot fuckers are at it. Long term load
average is 0.5; I have two cores so I can handle an average load of 2.0;
but when I looked at my sites this morning load was at 110. Some idiot
is training their AI again, is my guess.
</p>
<p>
I switched off Emacs Wiki and Community Wiki for the time being. They‚Äôll
be back when the AI bros are tired of downloading every link.
</p>
<p>
Munin shows load goin up and up and then Munin breaks down‚Ä¶
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-02-19-bots-again-1.jpg" alt="A Muningraph" />
</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Butlerian_Jihad">#Butlerian Jihad</a>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Emacs">#Emacs</a>
</p>
<p>
Compare this shit I should be dealing with to the stuff I want to look
at:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-02-19-bots-again-2.jpg" alt="Sunrise" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-02-19-bots-again-3.jpg" alt="Mountains" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-02-19-bots-again-4.jpg" alt="Snow" />
</p>
<p>
So here‚Äôs the new deal: I‚Äôm redirecting any request containing
‚Äúrcidonly‚Äù in the query string to
<a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/nobots">nobots</a>. This parameter is
used when showing recent changes for just a single page (‚Äúshow all
changes‚Äù), or for showing a feed for just one page. These are valid
links but when the Internet ingesting machines start slurping, these
endpoints are too expensive. This redirect to the static page already
saves us a lot of resources.
</p>
<p>
In addition to that, I wrote a fail2ban filter
<code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/alex-bots.conf</code> containing this:
</p>
<pre><code>[Definition]
# www.emacswiki.org:443 000.000.000.000 - - [19/Feb/2025:00:05:14 +0100] &quot;GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;from=1728421966&amp;rcidonly=Comments_on_FacesPerBuffer&amp;showedit=1 HTTP/1.1&quot; 200 7168 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/100.0.4896.127 Safari/537.36&quot;
failregex = ^(www\.emacswiki\.org|communitywiki\.org|campaignwiki\.org):[0-9]+ &lt;HOST&gt; .*rcidonly=
</code></pre>
<p>
And I added a section using this filter to my jail
<code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/alex.conf</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>[alex-bots]
enabled = true
port    = http,https
logpath = %(apache_access_log)s
findtime = 3600
maxretry = 2
</code></pre>
<p>
And when I check it, it already contained some bots:
</p>
<pre><code># fail2ban-client status alex-bots
Status for the jail: alex-bots
|- Filter
|  |- Currently failed: 166
|  |- Total failed:     474

`- Actions
   |- Currently banned: 0
   |- Total banned:     9
   `- Banned IP list:
</code></pre>
<p>
<strong>2025-02-20</strong>. I had some further problems.
</p>
<p>
The web interface to my IRC servers no longer worked. The Lounge
reported timeout errors.
</p>
<p>
So I investigated the IRC server and that seemed to work. I noticed that
no numbers appeared on Munin so I was confused. I added a config for
Monit, thinking that perhaps I‚Äôd get more info. But no, everything
seemed to work. I even managed to log on using the <code>irc</code>
program (ircII):
</p>
<pre><code>irc blog-reader SSLIRC/campaignwiki.org:6697
</code></pre>
<p>
Munin also didn‚Äôt show other info, like Apache data. Apparently that‚Äôs
due to me deleting the <code>000-default.conf</code> file which ensures
that localhost is in fact a virtual host. Without it, there‚Äôs no way to
access <code>http://localhost/server-info</code> and
<code>http://localhost/server-status</code>. Well, I fixed that, but
still no numbers.
</p>
<p>
This is when I realized that The Lounge managed to connect to other IRC
servers. It was only failing for my own server. And I started thinking.
</p>
<p>
All these symptoms pointed to me being blocked by my own firewall. And
so it was!
</p>
<p>
This even explained another small setup problem where two of my sites
behind Apache were being served by one service that listened on the same
port but for two domains. Those requests also were getting lost. I
rewrote that particular setup so that each site is now proxied directly
and therefore listens for <code>localhost</code> and a port instead of a
hostname and a port. Because that second pathway goes through the
firewall.
</p>
<p>
Yikes! So much headache only because I had blocked myself.

<p>Once again Maddow is must-watch destination TV this year. Keep on
going. One thing to watch out for, Bluesky <i>will</i> disappoint you.
Don‚Äôt blame them when it happens, because they can‚Äôt be as good as
people think they are. They‚Äôre a startup in a tough market. Sooner or
later Musk is going to aim at them (maybe he already is) and they will
have to seek refuge somewhere, and all big tech companies are bastards.
There isn‚Äôt one of them you can trust with your democracy. So keep that
in mind, and when you see open billionaire-proof social networks rise
up, give them a little the Rachel we love.</p>

<p>One more thing. I like watching Maddow nowadays. She seems unstuck.
And she‚Äôs talking straight to the Repubs, and not with resignation, with
the idea that maybe finally enough is enough, and they might work with
us to save what we can of this great country. Also like that Bernie
Sanders is on the road campaigning in swing districts that are held by
Repubs, to see if he can squeeze out a few defectors from the ranks of
House Republicans. Very important, because the Repub margin there is
only 3. Just have to flip 2. America has to start moving now, or it‚Äôs
going to take a long long time to come back from this. The sooner we all
get that, and that <i>we</i> are part of it, the better things will turn
out, imho.</p>

don‚Äôt like
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3likjorqzmk23">social
networks</a> as they‚Äôre currently configured. The idea that it‚Äôs some
kind of conversation ‚Äì no it really doesn‚Äôt resemble a conversation. I
would like to try a social network that didn‚Äôt have the concept of
replying to a post. Give each other a little more distance. It still
would be a graph, people following other people, but you wouldn‚Äôt be
able to insert something into someone else‚Äôs flow, which is where all
the indecency comes from imho. Or let replies be only visible to the
person it‚Äôs in reply to, so you don‚Äôt end up getting speeches under your
posts. And so that people with a lot of followers don‚Äôt bother reading
anything that‚Äôs related to what they wrote, and thus no new ideas can
enter the flow. We‚Äôve been doing this, the way we do it, since the
inception of Twitter in 2006. For some reason the design of that network
is considered sacred. I was a math major who studied combinatorics,
specifically graph theory ‚Äì and the Twitter way of organizing people and
discourse is just one of many ways people could be arranged.
Predictably, the weird structure of Twitter is turning into the
structure of our society. If we want to change things the fastest way
might be to do another look at what Twiiter does and see if we can‚Äôt
intentionally make something that works better for whatever we think we
should be doing with it, other than staring at the evil people on the
other side and saying how evil they are (or hopeless, or woke or
whatever bullshit the influencers have made up). And with that I wish
you a good evening and note that tomorrow is another day. <span

<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/02/russian-spies-use-device-code-phishing-to-hijack-microsoft-accounts/">increasingly
popular</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The technique is known as device code phishing. It exploits ‚Äúdevice code
flow,‚Äù a form of authentication formalized in the industry-wide
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-device-flow-07#section-3.4">OAuth
standard</a>. Authentication through device code flow is designed for
logging printers, smart TVs, and similar devices into accounts. These
devices typically don‚Äôt support browsers, making it difficult to sign in
using more standard forms of authentication, such as entering user
names, passwords, and two-factor mechanisms.
</p>
<p>
Rather than authenticating the user directly, the input-constrained
device displays an alphabetic or alphanumeric device code along with a
link associated with the user account. The user opens the link on a
computer or other device that‚Äôs easier to sign in with and enters the
code. The remote server then sends a token to the input-constrained
device that logs it into the account‚Ä¶

I started out doing a week to strip blue.threadcenter down to its bones,

these days I‚Äôm using it to the exclusion of pretty much everything else,

usually there‚Äôs nothing for me in those places. Anyway I‚Äôll be pointing

<pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;Because I get the same question on every video where I recompile the Linux kernel on a Pi to work on GPU or other hardware driver support, I finally made a video answering it:&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
<em>How do you recompile Linux?</em>
</p>
<p>
In my case, since I mostly rebuild the kernel for the Pi, I rebuild
<a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux">Raspberry Pi‚Äôs Linux
kernel fork</a> instead of ‚Äòmainline‚Äô linux (the upstream
<a href="https://www.kernel.org">Linux kernel source</a>).

<p>
Raspberry Pi publishes a very thorough guide covering
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/linux_kernel.html#building">building
and cross-compiling the Pi Linux kernel</a>, and my video today mostly
goes through that (with a few little tips on making the experience more
convenient):

<h2 id="an-example-of-ai-use">An example of AI use</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
I just thought of a good example of a question you could bring to
ChatGPT. Here‚Äôs the prompt.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>I‚Äôm thinking of driving from NYC to Jacksonville, FL. I want to do it
in four days with stopovers in three places that have good places to
ride a bike and a Citibike-style bike rental. Choose three places on the
trip, I don‚Äôt mind going out of my way.</i>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It gave me three places to stop, Washington DC, Raleigh NC and
Charleston SC. In each case it told me about the bike-sharing services
and notable bike trails.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2024/02/13/commanderDataStarTrek.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">A
logical next question would be to ask it to find hotels in each place
that are reasonably priced and near an interesting place to ride.
</p>
<p>
It also offered information about weather considerations. It‚Äôs not
necessarily a great time of year for bike riding.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm not actually planning a trip south, I just used it as an example
because I‚Äôve done this trip a number of times and was curious how things
had developed.
</p>
<p>
Another question I used to have when cross-country driving, where can I
find a Starbucks not too far off the route I‚Äôm on. If you were plotting
the progress of public information systems, AI is strictly on a
continuum of services that have developed over the years that make
information more accessible in the way you want it. It actually answers
questions you have in the way you think of asking them.

<p>
Here‚Äôs a
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67b4bace-25e8-8012-99e4-ddec819960e8 ">link

<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog</p>
<p>I‚Äôve never had writer‚Äôs block. Give me a writing assignment and I‚Äôll
blab something out. It might even be good, or at least good enough. But
I don‚Äôt write in final draft. Or talk that way. I know people who can do
either or both. But I don‚Äôt know how they do it, much as [‚Ä¶]</p>

<p>
One of the not-good things about Mastodon is that you can‚Äôt moderate
comments under your own posts.
</p>
<p>
If someone says something abusive, it‚Äôs there for everyone to see,
forever.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve come to value the feature in Facebook that gives the author full
discretion over what comments remain, to head off bad vibes.
</p>
<p>
I think of a post I write as my house, and I want people who visit to
feel respected.
</p>
<p>
A turd in the middle of the living room is not respectful.

<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
A simple idea, a quid pro quo.
</p>
<p>
If we want Democrats to support the Constitution, we have to demonstrate
that we will support them.
</p>
<p>
We are the government of the US, Congress represents us.
</p>
<p>
We have been too passive.
</p>
<p>
But then, they have to include us in governing.
</p>
<p>
No more shutting off the connection after the election.
</p>
<p>
Seems like a fair deal.

<p>
If I were in charge of marketing for the Democrats: 1. I‚Äôd restart the
online channel that Kamala Harris had that was shut down on Election
Day. 2. I‚Äôd get out the message over and over about how things are going
too fast, we need to slow it down, so we can consider what‚Äôs happening.
Who? The people. I know this will resonate with almost everyone in the
US, no matter who they voted for. Stop I want to know how these changes
will help or hurt me, my family, community. For Trump voters, it was fun
to make my statement, but I‚Äôm afraid this is going too far. I think we
can all relate to that. We aren‚Äôt being represented here.
</p>
<p>
I asked <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Google Gemini</a> to
visualize what it feels like to be watching what‚Äôs happening in the US
from inside the US. This came close to capturing it, but it could have
expressed the fear of it more clearly. Slow down, please, let us figure
out what you‚Äôre doing.
