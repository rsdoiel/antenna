<p>From left, Ana Chan, Chailang Palacios, Carol Chan Wong, and Lupe
Borja-Robinson. These four women on Saipan try to stay active each day. 
Chailang is a retired health educator who gardens in her yard and has
several dogs. She says her Catholic spirituality helps her stay focused
on the important things in life:  her faith, family, friends, and good
health. Chailang likes to do tai chi and swims every week with friends.
Lupe is a retired NMC instructor who taught Current Issues and English
as a Second Language classes. For her spirituality, she likes to walk
her dog at American Memorial Park for good health for the dog and
herself.  At AMP, she  focuses on the beauty of Mother Nature.  She and
her dog also get good exercise. She is a former staff writer of the
Pacific Daily News on Guam in the mid 1970’s. She believes she is very
fortunate to have covered the village meetings on Saipan, Tinian and
Rota leading to the plebiscite vote on the Commonwealth Covenant in
1976.  When she has time, she writes short articles with photos on local
issues for Marianas Variety. Sisters Ana, Carol, and Rose Chan from Hong
Kong helped their parents open and operate Canton Restaurant in Garapan
many years ago. Rose is presently off-island. The three sisters have
retired from the Canton Restaurant so it has a new management. The
restaurant is proud of its tasty lunch buffet served almost every
day.</p>
