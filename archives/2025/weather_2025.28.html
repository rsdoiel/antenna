Mesoscale Discussion 1670
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0318 PM CDT Mon Jul 14 2025

Areas affected...eastern Wyoming...southwestern South Dakota...and
Nebraska Panhandle

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 142018Z - 142215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storms are expected to increase in coverage and intensity
through the afternoon and evening.  Convective trends will be
monitored for the possibility of a severe thunderstorm watch.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms initiated early this afternoon over the
higher terrain of Wyoming, as ascent associated with an approaching
midlevel shortwave trough overspreads the area.  Continued
initiation over the higher terrain along with new initiation farther
east along the a surface pressure trough will eventually pose a
severe-weather threat later this afternoon and evening.  

Although low-level moisture is mixing out across much of the area
this afternoon (upper 40s to low 50s F 2-m Td), very steep low-level
and midlevel lapse rates (per 18Z UNR sounding) are still resulting
in over 1000 J/kg of MLCAPE.  The inverted-v thermodynamic profiles
across the region will support an isolated dry-microburst threat for
the strongest storms.  For a more organized severe threat,
deep-layer shear is marginally supportive and strongest (around 30
knots) with northward extent into northeastern Wyoming and
southwestern South Dakota.  The latest CAM guidance suggests some
potential for upscale growth of convection into clusters posing an
organized severe-wind threat.  Convective trends will be monitored
for this scenario and the possibility of a watch.

Mesoscale Discussion 1669
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0218 PM CDT Mon Jul 14 2025

Areas affected...southeastern Georgia into northern/central Florida

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 141918Z - 142145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected to increase in coverage and
intensity through the afternoon, posing an isolated threat of
damaging winds.  A severe thunderstorm watch is unlikely.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms have initiated on low-level convergence
boundaries across the region this afternoon in a hot, unstable
(~2500 J/kg MLCAPE) airmass.  While upper-tropospheric flow is weak
(per XMR 14Z sounding), enhanced low-to-midlevel northerly flow on
the west side of the low off the Atlantic coast may help storm
organization.  Local VWPs indicate around 25-30 knots of flow
between 700 and 500 mb, which may help to organize
southward-to-south-southwestward-propagating clusters as cold pools
begin to merge.  These storms will pose a damaging-wind threat this
afternoon, but the impacts are expected to be too isolated to
warrant a watch.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0257 PM CDT Mon Jul 14 2025

Valid 142000Z - 151200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF
THE MID-ATLANTIC AND THE NORTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to severe thunderstorms are possible across parts of the
northern Plains as well as the Mid-Atlantic States this afternoon
into tonight. Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms are possible
across the East, Mid-South, southeast Arizona, and Florida.

...20z Update...
The previous outlook remains on track and no significant changes
were made with this update. Towering cumulus/initial storm
development is underway across the higher terrain of WY and, as
remaining CINH as shown on the 18z Rapid City Sounding is removed
via diurnal heating, additional development is expected in the
vicinity of the Black Hills. Storms should tend to evolve into
clusters/line segments while moving east this afternoon and evening.
Very steep low- and mid-level lapse rates and dry low levels above
the boundary layer will result in a damaging wind risk, and an
isolated potential for severe hail with isolated stronger storms.

Across the mid-Atlantic, thunderstorms continue to develop and move
east within a very moist/moderately unstable air mass. Please refer
to Mesoscale Convective Discussion 1668 for the latest short-term
thinking regarding convective evolution in this area.

..Bunting.. 07/14/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1135 AM CDT Mon Jul 14 2025/

...Mid-Atlantic into the Northeast...
A belt of stronger mid-level flow extends from the north-central
CONUS/south-central Canadian Prairies through the Northeast, with
some modest cyclonic curvature. A more defined shortwave trough is
currently progressing into the Upper OH Valley/central Appalachians,
along the southern periphery of the belt of stronger, broadly
cyclonic flow. Showers and isolated thunderstorms are currently
ongoing just ahead of this shortwave. 

Expectation is for this shortwave trough to continue
eastward/northeastward throughout the day, with the modest upper
troughing farther north shifting eastward as well. A reservoir of
ample low-level moisture (i.e. dewpoints in the low to mid 70s) is
in place ahead of this shortwave. This low-level moisture will
support airmass destabilization and moderate buoyancy this afternoon
despite widespread cloudiness and tempered daytime heating.
Thunderstorm development is anticipated as large-scale ascent
attendant to the approaching shortwave (and larger upper trough)
moves into the region. Additionally, recent surface analysis places
a trough axis from the northern NY/VT border southwestward through
central PA. Low-level convergence along this axis could augment the
large-scale ascent. All of these factors will act to support
scattered to numerous thunderstorms this afternoon.

While mid-level flow and related deep-layer shear are both expected
to remain fairly modest, some of this convection could congeal into
multiple loosely organized clusters. Steepened low-level lapse rates
and water loaded downdrafts could support isolated strong to
damaging winds as thunderstorms spread generally eastward through
the afternoon and evening. Highest thunderstorm coverage and
greatest relative chance for damaging gusts is expected from eastern
PA through central VA.

...Northern Plains to Northern Minnesota...
Satellite imagery shows a vorticity maximum drifting slowly across
the central Intermountain West. Large-scale ascent attendant to this
vorticity maximum will augment low-level convergence along a
sharpening lee trough, likely resulting in enough lift to promote
thunderstorm development across eastern WY during the late
afternoon. This area is on the southern periphery of a belt of
stronger westerlies, and there appears to be just enough westerly
flow aloft for updraft organization and persistence into the better
moisture and buoyancy farther east. As such, there is a risk for
strong to severe gusts within this deeply mixed airmass throughout
the afternoon and evening.

Thunderstorm development also appears possible along a surface
trough that arcs from western MT to a low in southwest SD. A
conditional severe risk exists with any storms that develop near the
surface low over ND this afternoon, but the greater thunderstorm
coverage is anticipated later this evening and overnight as warm-air
advection across the frontal zone strengthens. Elevated
thunderstorms are also expected tonight as an
upper trough overspreads the northern Rockies. Given ample shear and
buoyancy, isolated hail is possible in both of these regions
tonight.

...Eastern GA into the FL Peninsula...
Ample low-level moisture and robust diurnal heating will result in
strong buoyancy from eastern GA southward across the entire FL
Peninsula this afternoon. A modest cyclone drifting westward towards
the GA/FL coast will interact with this airmass, contributing to
widespread thunderstorm development this afternoon. Convection
should develop along/near the Atlantic Coast before spreading
south-southwestward and inland across much of the FL Peninsula this
afternoon/evening. Several clusters capable of producing isolated
strong to severe winds are possible.

...AZ...
High pressure over the southern Great Basin will contribute to 
around 20-25 kt of northeasterly mid-level flow across southern AZ
this afternoon. This mid-level flow will take storms that develop
across the higher terrain southwestward into the deeply mixed
boundary layer over southeast AZ. A few strong to severe gusts are
possible, but overall coverage will likely be sparse.

...South-Central/Southeast TX into the Mid-South...
A trio of MCVs is apparent on radar and satellite imagery this
morning. One is centered over Real and Uvalde Counties in the TX
Hill Country, with another over Denton and Collin Counties in north
TX, and the third farther north over northeast AR. At least
scattered thunderstorms are possible this afternoon/evening with
each of these MCVs as they progress eastward/northeastward. Vertical
shear will be weak, but discrete storm propagation along the
stronger outflows could result in occasionally strong/damaging
downbursts.

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF EASTERN NEVADA INTO
WESTERN UTAH AND NORTHERN ARIZONA...

...Dry Thunderstorms...
An expansive area of isolated dry thunderstorms across the was
maintained for this update, with only slight northward adjustments
to highlights into north central Nevada as well as southeastern ID
and far western WY given latest model guidance consensus. An
advancing mid-level trough into the northwest and attendant
increased mid-level flow will support faster thunderstorm motions
particularly across central and northeastern NV Tuesday, with
northeast trajectories of 20-30 mph. This will limit rainfall
residence time and increase lightning ignition efficiency over dry
fuels.

...Great Basin...
Enhanced westerly flow over western Nevada associated with the an
encroaching mid-level trough over a deeply mixed boundary layer will
promote west winds approaching 20 mph across northwestern NV.
Relative humidity combined with higher winds will support an
elevated fire weather threat amid dry fuels. Higher winds under a
similarly dry boundary layer will bring critical fire weather
conditions to portions of eastern NV, southwestern UT and the
Arizona Strip.

..Williams.. 07/14/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0144 AM CDT Mon Jul 14 2025/

...Synopsis...
A deepening mid-level wave will bring an increase in winds and
potential for dry thunderstorms across the Great Basin on Tuesday.
Elevated to Critical conditions can be expected in portions of
eastern Nevada, western Utah, northern Arizona and southern Idaho.

...Eastern Nevada, western Utah, northern Arizona...
Increasing southwesterly flow around 10-20 mph will overlap with
afternoon relative humidity reductions to around 10-15 percent on
Tuesday afternoon. The best overlap of Critical winds and relative
humidity appears to be across eastern Nevada into western Utah.
Further south into northern Arizona and the Arizona Strip, winds may
be at or just below Critical thresholds. However, ongoing fires with
a history of erratic fire behavior warrant inclusion into the
Critical area. Gusty and erratic winds from nearby thunderstorms
will also be possible. 

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Isolated dry thunderstorms will be possible on the periphery of
deeper monsoonal moisture across portions of northern Arizona into
western Colorado, Utah, far southern Idaho, western Wyoming, and
Nevada. Within these regions, PWs generally around 0.25-0.50" are
expected with moisture remaining primarily mid-level with drier
boundary layer conditions below. This will promote high based
convection with little precipitation amid faster storm motions with
the mid-level trough passage. Fuels within these regions are
receptive to ignition and as such an isolated dry thunder area was
maintained with this outlook.

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE CENTRAL
HIGH PLAINS EASTWARD TO THE GREAT LAKES AND MIDWEST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe thunderstorms are possible Wednesday
afternoon and evening from parts of the central High Plains to the
Great Lakes.

...Central Plains...
At the start of the period, several areas of convection are likely
to be ongoing from eastern NE into northern KS and western IA.
Additional storms are likely ahead of the slow-moving cold
front/composite outflow sagging south from eastern WY and the
Rockies. Re-intensification and additional storm development appears
likely ahead of the boundary as a broad shortwave trough/MCV shift
eastward. The stronger vertical shear will likely lag to the north
of the front, casting some uncertainty on storm character. However,
sufficient buoyancy/shear should still support a damaging gust and
hail risk from the central High plains eastward.

...Great Lakes...
As the shortwave trough/MCV moves eastward ahead of the front,
redevelopment of scattered showers and thunderstorms is possible
Wednesday across parts of WI into northern IL and MI. Enhanced
westerly flow could support some severe risk with these storms
through the afternoon and potentially across the lower Great lakes
overnight. Confidence in the evolution of this threat is low but the
general environment will be favorable for severe storms with
2000-3000 J/kg of MLCAPE and 25-30+ kt of effective shear.

...Gulf Coast...
A tropical wave over the northern Gulf will likely support numerous
thunderstorms Wednesday afternoon and evening. A very high PWAT air
mass (> 2 inches) and slight enhancement of mid-level easterly shear
could allow for brief storm organization along the immediate central
Gulf Coast. Sporadic damaging gusts or a brief tornado could occur,
though convective details remain limited.

...Upper OH Valley...
On the fringes of the strong sub-tropical ridging, prior convection
could result in the development of an MCV across the OH valley and
central Appalachians early Wed. Should this occur, scattered storms
may redevelop through the morning across the Upper OH valley.
Slightly enhanced flow aloft and high PWATs would suggests some risk
for damaging gusts is possible. However, confidence in the overall
scenario is too low for higher probabilities at this time.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE CENTRAL
AND NORTHERN PLAINS AND WESTERN GREAT LAKES REGION...

...SUMMARY...
Strong to severe thunderstorms are possible Tuesday afternoon and
evening across portions of the central Plains to Upper Midwest.
Isolated damaging gusts are also possible over parts of the northern
Great Basin.

...Central/Northern Plains to the upper Midwest...
A positive-tilt upper trough is forecast to eject eastward with
several weaker leading disturbances located across the northern
Rockies Tuesday. Coincident with increasing mid/upper westerly flow,
height falls and weak ascent will support the development of a
surface low over western SD. This low will move into southern MN by
Wednesday morning, while a cold front will sag southward across MT,
the Dakotas and northern MN.

South of the front and surface low, a seasonably warm/humid air mass
will be in place near the triple point across NE and eastern SD,
extending northward along the front into the upper Midwest. Moderate
to strong destabilization (2500-3500 J/kg MLCAPE), and ascent from
the approaching upper troughs will promote scattered strong to
severe storms by the afternoon. Vertical shear around 25-35 kt will
support a mix of cells and clusters capable of damaging gusts and
hail.

A fairly quick transition to upscale growth is likely Tuesday
evening given the large buoyancy and weaker low-level flow allowing
for consolidation of outflow. Most CAM solutions show eventual MCS
development across central/southeast NE into the overnight hours.
Aided by a 40+ kt southerly low-level jet, this MCS could continue
into parts of western IA and northern KS with a risk for damaging
gusts through 12z.

Farther northeast along the front, veered low-level flow and largely
unidirectional wind profiles should favor a predominately linear
storm mode. One or more clusters may emerge primarily with a risk
for damaging gusts and hail as they moving from MN to northern WI
and western upper MI by Tuesday evening. Locally stronger flow aloft
and near the front could also support a brief tornado or two.

Isolated hail and damaging gusts will also be possible in the
post-frontal upslope flow regime across northern and eastern WY into
western SD. Enhanced mid-level flow and 500-1000 J/kg of MUCAPE
could support a few supercells or stronger clusters near and along
the front.

...Eastern Great Basin...
As the cold front gradually moves south, it should begin to stall
across the northern Great basin Tuesday afternoon. As forcing for
ascent from the upper trough interacts with strong diurnal heating,
scattered thunderstorm are expected along the front and adjacent
higher terrain from northeast NV, through northern UT and into
southwestern WY. Weak to moderate SBCAPE atop deep inverted-V
structures will favor strong downdrafts with these high-based
storms. Damaging gust potential will be maximized along the front
where locally stronger convergence and deep-layer shear should
support a larger concentration and greater persistence of
strong/occasionally severe storm clusters.

...Mid MS Valley...
Scattered to numerous thunderstorms remain likely with several
convectively augmented vort maxima/MCVs currently observed across
central/northeast TX. While less defined than previous guidance
cycles, locally stronger forcing for ascent and enhanced
low/mid-level flow could support one or more clusters of strong to
occasional severe storm Tuesday afternoon across the Mid MS Valley.
These clusters will develop within a very warm/unstable air mass
with the potential for occasional damaging gusts from heavily
water-loaded downdrafts. As mentioned in the prior outlook,
confidence in the ultimate location of theses features as well as
the resulting storm coverage/intensity remains too low to introduce
higher severe probabilities.

...Southern AZ...
Weak easterly flow and seasonably high monsoon moisture south of the
upper ridge are expected to support scattered thunderstorms across
parts of southern AZ Tuesday afternoon and evening. While steering
flow is not overly strong, some enhancement of the mid-level
easterlies could promote slightly more organized storm clusters
capable of damaging gusts given the deeply mixed PBL.

...Southeast and FL...
A weak tropical wave will likely serve as a focus for numerous
thunderstorms Tuesday and Tuesday night across parts of FL and the
Gulf Coast. A warm, unstable and humid air mass will support
numerous thunderstorm clusters over a broad area capable of sporadic
damaging downbursts through much of the day. Locally higher severe
probabilities will be greatest along sea breeze boundaries and near
the upper vort max. However, confidence in more than occasional
severe potential is low.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1148 AM CDT Mon Jul 14 2025

Valid 141700Z - 151200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR CENTRAL WASHINGTON...

...Central/Northeastern Utah and Northwestern Colorado...
A weak upper-level wave evident in water vapor imagery will move
through northern Utah today. Slightly increased mid-level flow on
the southern periphery of the wave will support enhanced dry
downslope flow into the Uinta Basin and along and east of the
central Utah mountain chain. Sustained winds of 10-15 mph along with
10-15 percent relative humidity will result in a period of elevated
fire weather conditions over dry fuels where ERC values are around
the 97th percentile.

Otherwise, no major changes to previous forecast (see below) for the
Northwest, Great Basin or Snake River Plain highlights.

..Williams.. 07/14/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0138 AM CDT Mon Jul 14 2025/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will bring a belt of enhanced westerly flow aloft
across portions of the Pacific Northwest today. A period of Elevated
to Critical fire weather conditions can be expected across the
Columbia River Basin in Oregon and Washington and in the Snake River
Plain in Idaho. The trough will also promote dry thunderstorm
development across the Great Basin.

...Cascades and Columbia River Basin...
Relative humidity reductions to 15-20 percent will combine with west
winds around 15 mph promoting elevated fire weather concerns for the
Columbia River Basin through Monday afternoon. A considerable wind
shift is expected with the dry cold front passage beginning early
afternoon across the Okanagan Valley before reaching the Columbia
River by evening. Although relative humidity will rise behind the
front, a few hours of sustained north winds of 20-30 mph will create
Critical fire weather concerns and could significantly impact
existing active or new fires Monday.

...Snake River Plain...
Relative humidity reductions to 15-20 percent will combine with
westerly winds around 10-15 mph (locally higher) through Monday
afternoon. Locally stronger winds may bring near Critical to
Critical conditions, however the localized nature precludes
inclusion of a Critical area at this time. 

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Forcing for ascent with the upper-level trough will allow for high
based convection to develop across portions of the northern Great
Basin. Primarily mid-level moisture will overspread a very dry and
warm boundary layer, with little to no precipitation and storm
motions around 10-20 mph. This in combination with critical fuels
supports maintaining and area of isolated dry thunderstorm chances
across northern Nevada into southeastern Oregon, southern Idaho, and
far northeastern Nevada.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
MID-ATLANTIC AS WELL AS FAR EAST-CENTRAL WYOMING...SOUTHWEST SOUTH
DAKOTA...AND THE FAR NORTHERN NEBRASKA PANHANDLE...

CORRECTED FOR INCORRECT GEOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION IN HEADLINE

...SUMMARY...
Strong to severe thunderstorms are possible across parts of the
northern Plains as well as the Mid-Atlantic States this afternoon
into tonight. Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms are possible
across the Mid-South, southeast Arizona, and Florida.

...Mid-Atlantic into the Northeast...
A belt of stronger mid-level flow extends from the north-central
CONUS/south-central Canadian Prairies through the Northeast, with
some modest cyclonic curvature. A more defined shortwave trough is
currently progressing into the Upper OH Valley/central Appalachians,
along the southern periphery of the belt of stronger, broadly
cyclonic flow. Showers and isolated thunderstorms are currently
ongoing just ahead of this shortwave. 

Expectation is for this shortwave trough to continue
eastward/northeastward throughout the day, with the modest upper
troughing farther north shifting eastward as well. A reservoir of
ample low-level moisture (i.e. dewpoints in the low to mid 70s) is
in place ahead of this shortwave. This low-level moisture will
support airmass destabilization and moderate buoyancy this afternoon
despite widespread cloudiness and tempered daytime heating.
Thunderstorm development is anticipated as large-scale ascent
attendant to the approaching shortwave (and larger upper trough)
moves into the region. Additionally, recent surface analysis places
a trough axis from the northern NY/VT border southwestward through
central PA. Low-level convergence along this axis could augment the
large-scale ascent. All of these factors will act to support
scattered to numerous thunderstorms this afternoon.

While mid-level flow and related deep-layer shear are both expected
to remain fairly modest, some of this convection could congeal into
multiple loosely organized clusters. Steepened low-level lapse rates
and water loaded downdrafts could support isolated strong to
damaging winds as thunderstorms spread generally eastward through
the afternoon and evening. Highest thunderstorm coverage and
greatest relative chance for damaging gusts is expected from eastern
PA through central VA.

...Northern Plains to Northern Minnesota...
Satellite imagery shows a vorticity maximum drifting slowly across
the central Intermountain West. Large-scale ascent attendant to this
vorticity maximum will augment low-level convergence along a
sharpening lee trough, likely resulting in enough lift to promote
thunderstorm development across eastern WY during the late
afternoon. This area is on the southern periphery of a belt of
stronger westerlies, and there appears to be just enough westerly
flow aloft for updraft organization and persistence into the better
moisture and buoyancy farther east. As such, there is a risk for
strong to severe gusts within this deeply mixed airmass throughout
the afternoon and evening.

Thunderstorm development also appears possible along a surface
trough that arcs from western MT to a low in southwest SD. A
conditional severe risk exists with any storms that develop near the
surface low over ND this afternoon, but the greater thunderstorm
coverage is anticipated later this evening and overnight as warm-air
advection across the frontal zone strengthens. Elevated
thunderstorms are also expected tonight as an
upper trough overspreads the northern Rockies. Given ample shear and
buoyancy, isolated hail is possible in both of these regions
tonight.

...Eastern GA into the FL Peninsula...
Ample low-level moisture and robust diurnal heating will result in
strong buoyancy from eastern GA southward across the entire FL
Peninsula this afternoon. A modest cyclone drifting westward towards
the GA/FL coast will interact with this airmass, contributing to
widespread thunderstorm development this afternoon. Convection
should develop along/near the Atlantic Coast before spreading
south-southwestward and inland across much of the FL Peninsula this
afternoon/evening. Several clusters capable of producing isolated
strong to severe winds are possible.

...AZ...
High pressure over the southern Great Basin will contribute to 
around 20-25 kt of northeasterly mid-level flow across southern AZ
this afternoon. This mid-level flow will take storms that develop
across the higher terrain southwestward into the deeply mixed
boundary layer over southeast AZ. A few strong to severe gusts are
possible, but overall coverage will likely be sparse.

...South-Central/Southeast TX into the Mid-South...
A trio of MCVs is apparent on radar and satellite imagery this
morning. One is centered over Real and Uvalde Counties in the TX
Hill Country, with another over Denton and Collin Counties in north
TX, and the third farther north over northeast AR. At least
scattered thunderstorms are possible this afternoon/evening with
each of these MCVs as they progress eastward/northeastward. Vertical
shear will be weak, but discrete storm propagation along the
stronger outflows could result in occasionally strong/damaging
downbursts.

0735 AM CDT Mon Jul 14 2025

Valid 141300Z - 151200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN PLAINS...EAST...MID-SOUTH...AND SOUTHEAST ARIZONA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms are possible across parts of
the northern Plains, East, Mid-South, and southeast Arizona this
afternoon into tonight.

...Northern Plains to Northern Minnesota...
As an upper trough digs southward from British Columbia to the
northern Rockies today, a belt of enhanced mid-level westerlies will
extend along/near the international border from MT to MN. At the
surface, a front should also extend generally west-east across this
region, displaced slightly south of the mid-level jet. The western
portion of this front (across MT/ND) is forecast to move southward
tonight as a surface low gradually develops/consolidates near the
MT/ND/SD border.

Forcing for ascent will remain weak for much of the day as mid-level
heights remain neutral. Still, high-based convection may develop
across the northern Rockies and adjacent High Plains by this
afternoon/evening. With steep low/mid-level lapse rates and modest
westerly mid-level flow present, some of these thunderstorms could
pose an isolated threat for severe winds/hail as they move eastward
through the evening. The potential for surface-based convection to
develop in proximity to the front remains unclear. A conditionally
favorable environment for severe thunderstorms will exist near the
front, but weak forcing and increasing MLCIN/warmer temperatures
aloft with southward extent cast considerable uncertainty regarding
overall thunderstorm coverage this afternoon/evening. A better
chance exists for elevated thunderstorms to occur tonight as the
upper trough overspreads the northern Rockies. This activity could
pose an isolated threat for mainly severe hail given ample MUCAPE
and strong shear forecast in the cloud-bearing layer.

...Eastern States...
As a weak mid-level shortwave trough moves eastward from the OH
Valley across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast today, scattered to
numerous thunderstorms are expected to initially develop across the
higher terrain of these regions. While mid-level flow and related
deep-layer shear are both expected to remain fairly modest, some of
this convection could congeal into multiple loosely organized
clusters. With daytime heating of a moist low-level airmass,
moderate instability should develop across the lower terrain east of
the Blue Ridge/Appalachians. Modestly steepened low-level lapse
rates should also aid in some enhancement to convective downdrafts,
with isolated strong to damaging winds possible as thunderstorms
spread generally eastward through the afternoon and evening.

Farther south across parts of FL and southeast GA, convection should
develop along/near the Atlantic Coast before spreading
south-southwestward and inland across much of the FL Peninsula this
afternoon/evening. This activity will be associated with a weak
low/mid-level trough currently off the FL Atlantic Coast. While
low-level and deep-layer shear are both forecast to remain modest,
some enhancement to mid/upper-level north-northeasterlies could
promote multiple clusters capable of producing isolated strong to
severe winds given moderate to locally strong instability.

...Mid-South...
A remnant MCV will drift east-northeastward today over the Mid-South
and vicinity while gradually weakening. Modest enhancement to the
low/mid-level flow attendant to this feature could support an
isolated damaging wind threat with convection that develops this
afternoon. But, with deep-layer shear expected to remain weak, the
overall severe threat will likely remain quite isolated/marginal.

...Arizona...
A mid-level anticyclone will remain anchored over the southern Great
Basin today. On the periphery of this anticyclone, around 20-25 kt
of northeasterly mid-level flow may aid thunderstorms that develop
over the higher terrain of southeast AZ/southwest NM in moving
southwestward this afternoon/evening across lower elevations. A very
deeply mixed boundary layer may support isolated severe wind gusts
with this activity, even though instability and deep-layer shear
will likely remain weak.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0329 AM CDT Mon Jul 14 2025

Valid 171200Z - 221200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Upper ridging will build across the south-central and southeastern
U.S. during the Day 4-8 period. This will confine a series of
low-amplitude upper troughs to the northern tier of the U.S. along
the international border. Bouts of strong to severe thunderstorm
potential will be possible through the period as individual
shortwaves provide modestly enhanced mid/upper westerly flow from
the northern Plains to the Great Lakes vicinity. Given the generally
low-amplitude nature the upper pattern across the northern U.S.
through at least Day 6 or 7/Sat or Sun, the main driver of severe
potential each day will be mesoscale features tied to prior days
convective evolution, not well resolved at longer time scales. As a
result, predictability is low.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 132041Z - 132245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Storms with locally damaging winds are possible through
the remainder of the afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Some increase in storm coverage and intensity has been
noted within a very moist and strongly buoyant environment across
east-central TX, along a composite outflow to the east of a
well-defined MCV over central TX. Deep-layer shear is relatively
weak, but modest southwesterly low/midlevel flow attendant to the
MCV and further outflow consolidation could result in a
northeastward-moving storm cluster that will move toward the
ArkLaTex region through the remainder of the afternoon. Such a
cluster could be accompanied by isolated damaging winds. Additional
storm development will be possible ahead of this developing cluster
into northeast TX and southwest AR, which may also be capable of
producing localized downbursts.

Areas affected...southwestern New Mexico and southeastern Arizona

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 132038Z - 132315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storms are expected to increase in coverage and intensity
through the afternoon and into the evening, posing a severe wind
risk.  A severe thunderstorm watch is possible.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms have initiated over the high terrain this
afternoon across the region.  While moisture is meager for this time
of year, it is sufficient to support 500-1000 J/kg of MLCAPE and
robust updrafts.  The 18Z Tucson sounding represents the
characteristic well-mixed, inverted-V sounding profiles across the
region.  Certainly, this environment will support dry-microburst
potential for the strongest storms.  With northeasterly midlevel
flow expected to increase this afternoon and evening, a more
organized wind threat could develop and move south-southwestward off
the higher terrain.  Convective trends will continue to be monitored
for the possibility of watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1662
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0241 PM CDT Sun Jul 13 2025

Areas affected...Parts of central/eastern VA...central MD...the
eastern WV Panhandle

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 131941Z - 132115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated damaging wind remains possible through late
afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Earlier convection across MD and eastern VA has
generated a westward-moving outflow approaching central VA.
Meanwhile, other storms have developed this afternoon along/east of
the Blue Ridge. Deep-layer flow is quite weak across the region,
resulting in generally disorganized storms. However, strong heating
of a very moist airmass (PW around 2 inches) has resulted in MLCAPE
increasing above 3000 J/kg in areas outside of convective outflow.
The large PW and favorable buoyancy will support a threat of
localized wet microbursts, both with storms along the
westward-moving outflow, and the storms moving slowly eastward off
of the Blue Ridge. Outflow collisions may result in brief upticks in
storm intensity through the remainder of the afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1661
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0214 PM CDT Sun Jul 13 2025

Areas affected...eastern Florida peninsula

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 131914Z - 132145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected to continue developing and
moving southward through the afternoon posing an isolated damaging
wind threat.  A severe thunderstorm watch is unlikely.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms continue to develop along the eastern
peninsula of Florida in a very moist and unstable environment. 
While the deep-layer flow/shear is weak (per XMR 15Z sounding),
there does appear to be enhanced north-northwesterly low-level flow
likely associated with the midlevel low off the east coast of
Florida.  As a result, 0-3 km northerly shear is around 20 knots
(per MLB VWP), which is at least modestly supportive of
southward-propagating clusters capable of producing severe, damaging
wind gusts through the afternoon.  The localized, isolated nature of
the threat will preclude watch issuance.
