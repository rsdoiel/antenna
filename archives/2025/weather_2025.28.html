Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0730 AM CDT Wed Jul 16 2025

Valid 161300Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE MIDWEST/GREAT LAKES AND CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe thunderstorms are possible this afternoon
and evening from parts of the central High Plains to the Great Lakes
and Mid-Atlantic.

...Midwest/Great Lakes...
A well-defined MCV is evident on radar/satellite imagery this
morning over IA. This feature will drift east-northeastward today
across the Midwest and Great Lakes, eventually reaching southern
Ontario tonight. A related surface low will develop from IA to
southern WI and Lake Michigan this afternoon/evening, with the
primary synoptic front farther north in WI. Diurnal heating of a
rather moist low-level airmass will likely yield around 1000-2500
J/kg of MLCAPE across southern WI into northern/central IL (locally
stronger with southward extent). The modestly enhanced low/mid-level
winds associated with the MCV should support around 30-40 kt of
deep-layer shear, sufficient for organized severe thunderstorms.

Current expectations are for a band of semi-discrete thunderstorms
to develop across eastern IA into northern IL and southern/central
WI by early to mid afternoon as large-scale ascent attendant to the
MCV overspreads the destabilizing warm sector. Some of this activity
could be supercellular initially and pose a threat for isolated
severe hail along with damaging winds. With time late this afternoon
and evening, gradual upscale growth into a bowing cluster should
occur, with a greater risk for severe/damaging winds towards Lake
Michigan and parts of southern Lower MI. Although low-level flow and
related shear is not forecast to become overly strong this
afternoon, it should be sufficient for some low-level updraft
rotation and perhaps a few tornadoes, particularly across parts of
southern WI/northern IL where semi-discrete convection may occur.

...Ohio Valley/Mid-Atlantic...
A weak mid-level shortwave trough located over the OH Valley this
morning will advance northeastward today to the northern
Mid-Atlantic/NY. Recent visible satellite imagery this morning shows
considerable cloud cover present with this feature, along with some
low clouds downstream. Even so, filtered daytime heating of a
seasonably moist airmass should support the development of weak to
locally moderate instability by this afternoon. Poor lapse rates
aloft may tend to inhibit stronger updrafts to some extent, but
marginal deep-layer shear (generally around 20-30 kt) should still
support some degree of convective organization. Loosely organized
clusters and occasional cells may pose an isolated threat for
damaging winds as they spread generally east-northeastward across
parts of the OH Valley and Mid-Atlantic this afternoon/evening.
Confidence in a more concentrated corridor of damaging winds remains
too low to include greater severe probabilities at this time.

...Central Plains to Northern Missouri...
A convectively reinforced surface front should stall by this
afternoon across KS into eastern CO, with a modest low-level upslope
flow regime occurring across the Front Range/central High Plains. On
the southern periphery of an upper trough moving eastward over the
northern/central Plains, thunderstorms should develop by early
afternoon over the higher terrain of the central Rockies. This
convection is forecast to move eastward into the adjacent High
Plains through the rest of the afternoon, and continuing through the
evening. The post-frontal airmass should only modestly destabilize,
but enough instability and the presence of steepened lapse rates
aloft are forecast to support robust updrafts. Weak low-level flow
veering to westerly and gradually strengthening with height at
mid/upper levels will likely foster around 35-45 kt of deep-layer
shear. This will easily support supercells and associated large hail
threat with the initial development. Some potential for upscale
growth into a loosely organized cluster is possible across southeast
CO and vicinity this evening along/near the stalled surface front.
If this occurs, then severe winds would become the primary risk.

Farther east across KS into northern MO, isolated convection may
develop through peak afternoon heating along the front. While
deep-layer shear is forecast to remain fairly modest, strong
instability and steep mid-level lapse rates could still support
occasional severe hail/wind with the more robust cores that can be
sustained. Additional convection may develop along/north of the
front this evening in a low-level warm advection regime, while also
posing an isolated severe threat.

...Central Gulf Coast...
Convection offshore from the central Gulf Coast remains disorganized
this morning, as a weak surface low (Invest 93L) remains along/near
the coast of the FL Panhandle. Regardless of potential tropical
development (reference latest NHC forecast), modest enhancement to
the low-level wind field should occur as this feature tracks towards
coastal/southeast LA by early Thursday morning. Thunderstorms should
occasionally spread inland along/near the central Gulf Coast through
the period, but overall severe potential still appears too limited
to introduce a Marginal Risk with this update.

Mesoscale Discussion 1677
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0350 PM CDT Tue Jul 15 2025

Areas affected...northeastern Nevada...northern Utah...southeastern
Idaho...and southwestern Wyoming

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 152050Z - 152315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storms will increase in coverage and intensity through the
afternoon, posing a threat of dry microburst winds.  Convective
trends will be monitored for the possibility of a watch.

DISCUSSION...A glancing influence from the shortwave trough to the
north is resulting in some large-scale ascent and an increase in
midlevlel winds this afternoon.  Initial storms are increasing in
coverage and intensity across northeastern Nevada, and this activity
is expected to spread east-northeastward through the afternoon into
southwestern Wyoming.  The 17Z DPG sounding characterizes the very
steep lapse rates (near dry adiabatic up to around 500 mb) in which
these storms are forming.  This environment will support very strong
downdrafts and dry-microburst potential.  Recent VWPs from Salt Lake
City indicate around 30 knots of mid-to-upper-level flow, which may
support some storm organization and propagation.  If storms are able
to organize into clusters, a severe thunderstorm watch may be
considered.

Mesoscale Discussion 1676
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0312 PM CDT Tue Jul 15 2025

Areas affected...eastern Idaho...southern Montana...and
northern/central Wyoming

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 152012Z - 152215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storms are expected to increase in coverage and intensity
through the afternoon posing a risk of severe hail and winds. 
Convective trends will be monitored for the possibility of a watch.

DISCUSSION...Large-scale ascent ahead of a midlevel trough (evident
over the northern Intermountain West in water vapor imagery) is
resulting in thunderstorm development over portions of eastern Idaho
and southwestern Montana.  As this ascent overspreads Wyoming where
better instability is developing, storms are expected to intensify
and organize later this afternoon into the evening.  

Recent VWPs from the Pocatello radar indicate that midlevel westerly
flow has increased to around 40 knots as this disturbance
approaches.  Consequently, there should be enough shear for some
storm organization despite limited instability.  Steep midlevel
lapse rates may support some hail threat with the initial updraft
cores, but the primary threat will be severe winds, as these storms
are developing and moving into deep, well-mixed boundary layers. 
This environment will favor strong evaporative cooling and
dry-microburst potential.  If storms are able to grow upscale into
clusters, a more organized severe-wind threat may materialize
warranting watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1675
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0258 PM CDT Tue Jul 15 2025

Areas affected...south-central South Dakota into much of central
Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 151958Z - 152230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Storms will erupt across south-central South Dakota into
northern and west-central Nebraska in the next 1-2 hours, producing
large hail initially followed by damaging winds.

DISCUSSION...A cold front stretches from east-central SD into
western NE and far eastern CO, with a surface low over western NE.
Satellite imagery shows strong heating and building CU fields along
the front and near the low, and this is where initiation will occur.

Deep-layer lapse rates continue to steepen as a midlevel wave
approaches from the west, and surface temperatures warm. When
combined with mid to upper 60s F dewpoints, moderately strong
instability is noted with MLCAPE to around 3000 J/kg.

Modest westerlies aloft combined with a persistent southerly
boundary-layer winds will support southeastward-moving storms. A few
supercells producing damaging hail are possible initially, but an
evolution to severe MCS is anticipated from late afternoon through
evening. Corridors of significant wind damage may occur.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 514
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
350 PM CDT Tue Jul 15 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northern Kansas
  Western and Central Nebraska
  Southeast South Dakota

* Effective this Tuesday afternoon and evening from 350 PM until
  1100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 80
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to develop along a
front this afternoon into the evening and grow upscale into a linear
cluster.  Large hail will be the primary severe hazard this
afternoon before storms increase in coverage and congeal into one or
two linear clusters.  Severe gusts will become the primary severe
hazard during the evening as this activity moves east-southeast
across the Watch area.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 85
statute miles east and west of a line from 35 miles east northeast
of Chamberlain SD to 20 miles south southeast of Mccook NE. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0258 PM CDT Tue Jul 15 2025

Valid 152000Z - 161200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
CENTRAL NEBRASKA...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
THE INTERIOR WEST...AND PARTS OF THE CENTRAL PLAINS INTO THE UPPER
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe gusts (some 75+ mph) and large hail are probable
across parts of Nebraska late this afternoon and evening.  Scattered
severe gusts are also possible from the Upper Midwest to Utah and
Wyoming this afternoon to mid-evening.

...20Z Update...
The previous forecast remains on track, with only minor changes to
the general thunder line to reflect the latest observations. Please
refer to MCD 1675 for some of the latest short-term trends for storm
development over portions of the central Plains.

..Squitieri.. 07/15/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1121 AM CDT Tue Jul 15 2025/

...Northern/Central Plains to the Upper Midwest...
Primary focus for thunderstorms will be a slowly sagging,
southward-moving cold front across the Upper Midwest and a couple
mid-level perturbations moving east across the north-central states.
Radar imagery shows a convectively augment disturbance moving east
across northern SD and water-vapor imagery shows shortwave trough
moving east across southeast WY.  Both mid-level features will
likely prove instrumental in storm coverage and the risk for severe
activity later today.  

Despite stronger mid-level westerly flow relegated north of the 48th
parallel, strong heating of a moist airmass will result in a very
unstable boundary layer by mid afternoon from the Upper Midwest
southwestward into the NE Sandhills.  Storms will probably develop
from eastern SD and into MN this afternoon near the front and ahead
of the SD mid-level feature.  Sufficient instability and
effective bulk shear should be present along/ahead of the front to
support organized convection, including some supercells. Large hail
will be possible with the initially semi-discrete thunderstorms,
before a rapid transition to a cluster/linear mode increases the
threat for severe/damaging winds. This activity should quickly
weaken by late evening as it encounters a less unstable airmass with
eastward extent across the upper Great Lakes.

A somewhat separate area of thunderstorms should initiate
along/south of the front across parts of southern SD into NE by late
afternoon/early evening. Greater instability will likely be present
across this region compared to locations farther north, but
deep-layer shear should be more modest (around 25-30 kt). Still,
some large hail may occur initially given the presence of steep
mid-level lapse rates. The threat for scattered to numerous
severe/damaging winds is expected to increase through the evening
across central NE as an intense bowing cluster develops and spreads
southeastward. Isolated significant gusts of 75+ mph appear possible
given the rather favorable thermodynamic environment.

...Great Basin into Wyoming...
The only change for this portion of the region is to increase
severe-wind probabilities across northern UT and surrounding states.
The southern fringe of stronger mid-level westerlies was sampled by
the 12 UTC Salt Lake City raob.  With the approach of the upstream
northern Rockies disturbance glancing the region later today,
short-term model guidance (e.g., HREF members, time-lagged HRRR) is
consistent in showing small clusters of storms moving east from
northeast NV/northwest UT eastward into northern UT/southeast ID/far
southwest WY.  Inverted-V profiles will strongly favor evaporative
cooling with the more rain-laden cores.  Scattered severe gusts are
possible with the more intense downbursts through early evening.  

Farther east, the closer proximity to the upper trough digging
southeastward over the northern Rockies will promote scattered
storms across northern into eastern WY this afternoon and evening. 
An organized cluster may evolve given 25-35 kt of deep-layer shear,
while posing a threat for mainly severe/damaging winds given the
presence of steepened low/mid-level lapse rates. Isolated large hail
may also occur. 

...Arizona...
Modest mid-level east-northeasterlies will be present today across
parts of AZ on the southern periphery of a mid-level anticyclone
over the Southwest. Scattered thunderstorms should once again
develop this afternoon over the higher terrain of southeast AZ and
southwest NM. With very steep low/mid-level lapse rates expected
with ample daytime heating, this activity may pose an isolated
threat for severe winds as it spreads into the lower elevations of
southern AZ through the evening.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0241 PM CDT Tue Jul 15 2025

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

Only minor adjustments were made to previous forecast highlights. A
broad dry thunderstorm threat will remain across portions of the
Great Basin, Utah and Western Slope. Thermodynamic profiles remain
supportive of high-based thunderstorms with dry sub cloud layer
evaporation minimizing appreciable rainfall while increasing
potential new lightning ignitions over critically dry fuels. Dry and
breezy conditions across eastern NV and west-central UT will promote
an elevated fire weather threat amid fuel ERC values around the 97th
percentile, supporting fire spread.

..Williams.. 07/15/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0155 AM CDT Tue Jul 15 2025/

...Synopsis...
A departing mid-level trough will bring continued breezy conditions
and Elevated fire weather concerns across portions of southeastern
Nevada into western Utah on Wednesday. Afternoon relative humidity
reductions to 10-15 percent will overlap winds 10-15 mph in these
regions. Fuels remain critically dry with recent dry lightning and
potential for quick spread of new fires.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
A broad area of dry thunderstorm activity will be possible again
from northern AZ into western CO, UT, southern WY, and portions of
eastern NV. High based thunderstorms are expected to continue to
bring little to no rainfall amid critically dry fuels. This will
support potential for new lightning ignitions.

0224 PM CDT Tue Jul 15 2025

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE OHIO
VALLEY TO THE NORTHEAST STATES...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated damaging gusts are possible over parts of the Northeast
Thursday.

...Northeast and upper OH Valley...
Shortwave troughing over the eastern Great Lakes will gradually
merge with broader cyclonic flow over the Northeast and eastern
Canada Thursday. A surface low will steadily deepen as it shifts
eastward with the upper trough. A cold front trailing the low will
serve as a focus for thunderstorm development through the afternoon
from the OH valley to the Mid Atlantic and Northeast. Moderate
buoyancy and strengthening flow aloft will overlap and could support
scattered thunderstorms capable of damaging gusts ahead of the
front. A large disparity exists among forecast guidance with regards
to the position of the cold front, strength of the surface low and
any potential MCVs from prior day's convection. While confidence in
the overall evolution is somewhat low, the broader environment still
appears favorable enough to support some severe risk.

...Mid MS Valley and southern Plains...
Scattered storms are expected along the cold front as it moves
southward across the Mid South and the Southern Plains. Stronger
vertical shear should largely lag behind the front especially with
southward extent. A few stronger storm clusters are possible along
the front where large buoyancy could support sporadic damaging
gusts. However, confidence in the frontal timing and convective
evolution is very low, precluding the addition of severe
probabilities for now.

CORRECTED FOR ERRANT LINE IN SOUTHERN TEXAS

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHEASTERN NEVADA...NORTHWESTERN
UTAH AND SOUTH CENTRAL IDAHO...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN NEVADA INTO WESTERN UTAH
AND NORTHERN ARIZONA...

...Dry Thunderstorms...
A mid-level trough and attendant increased mid-level flow will
provide support for more sustained convection across portions
northeastern NV, far northwestern UT and south-central ID this
afternoon. High-based thunderstorm motions of 25-30 mph will limit
rainfall to less than 0.10 inch while also bringing potential new
ignitions over a very dry fuelscape in addition to gusty and erratic
outflow winds from downbursts. Less concentrated but still impactful
elevated thunderstorms will bring new ignition potential to portions
of the Four Corners area, much of UT, northeastern NV, southeastern
ID and western WY.

Otherwise, dry and breezy conditions across the Snake River Plain
and the Great Basin will bring elevated fire weather conditions to
the region today. A critical fire weather threat remains for
portions of southeast NV, southwestern UT and the Arizona Strip.

..Williams.. 07/15/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0154 AM CDT Tue Jul 15 2025/

...Synopsis...
An active day for fire weather is expected across the Southwest and
Great Basin today. A deepening mid-level wave will bring an increase
in winds and potential for dry thunderstorms across the Great Basin
today. Elevated to Critical conditions can be expected in portions
of eastern Nevada, western Utah, northern Arizona and southern
Idaho.

...Eastern Nevada, western Utah, northern Arizona...
West to southwesterly flow around 15-20 mph will overlap afternoon
relative humidity reductions to 10-15 percent across portions of
eastern NV, western UT, and northern AZ. Fuels in these regions are
critically dry, with notable increase in fire activity over the last
couple of weeks. In addition to background surface winds, nearby
thunderstorm activity may further produce gusty and erratic outflow
winds.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
A broad area of dry thunderstorms will be possible across portions
of northern Arizona into western Colorado, Utah, far southern Idaho,
western Wyoming, and Nevada. Moisture varies across these regions
with potential for a mix of wet/dry storms in a few locations.
Moisture remains mostly mid-level and with increased storm motions
expected with the passage of the mid-level trough, it is likely that
rainfall will be limited and local with new lightning ignitions
possible. Fuels are critically dry with an uptick in fire activity
over last several weeks.

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE FRONT
RANGE AND THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES REGION...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe thunderstorms are possible Wednesday
afternoon and evening from parts of the central High Plains to the
Great Lakes.

...Front Range and High Plains...
A shortwave trough over the northern Rockies will intensify as it
moves eastward across the central US Wednesday. A cold front across
the Front Range and High Plains will continue to sag slowly
southward as surface moisture deepens behind it. Within the broad up
slope flow regime, scattered storm development is expected across
the higher terrain of the central Rockies and High Plains by early
afternoon Wednesday. Enhanced mid-level flow will support initial
supercells capable of hail and isolated damaging gusts. Local
terrain effects and enhanced low-level shear near the front may also
allow for a tornado or two. Scattered severe storms expand in
coverage across the I-25 corridor through the afternoon before
moving eastward into the plains through the evening.

How far east the severe threat will extend remains uncertain as
cooler temperatures and lingering inhibition are likely to be in
place behind the front. Should sufficient upscale growth take place,
an MCS may develop and merge with additional convection farther east
before continuing south/southeastward across the central Plains
overnight. This would support a continued risk for at least isolated
damaging gusts.

...Central Plains...
As the cold front continues to move southward across the central
Plains, lingering inhibition and forcing for ascent displaced to the
north should limit convective development along the front through
much of the day However, warm surface temperatures and 60s-70s F
surface dewpoints will support large buoyancy along the front. As a
30-40 kt low-level jet increases into the evening, storm development
is expected with increasing low-level warm air advection. Isolated
damaging gust are possible.

...Great Lakes...
A convectively augmented shortwave trough over the central Plains
will quickly move eastward along the sagging cold front. Ascent from
this feature will aid in developing a wave cyclone along the front,
enhancing the low-level flow field across parts of WI and northern
IL. An ongoing arc of storms near the surface low should gradually
re-intensify through the morning and into the early afternoon.
Moderate MLCAPE and strengthening flow aloft will support a mix of
cells and clusters. The primary risk is expected to be damaging
gusts, though enlarged low-level hodographs and 100-200 J/kg of
MLCAPE below 3km AGL may support some tornado risk with the more
cellular elements. With time gradual upscale growth into a more
linear structure is expected near the western shores of Lake
Michigan with a continued risk for damaging gusts.

To the east, strong heating of a very humid air mass is expected
across Lower Michigan through the afternoon. Scattered to widespread
storms are likely along the typical lake breeze fronts. Vertical
shear will be weaker through the afternoon, though at least some
enhancement of the flow field could support isolated damaging gusts
with scattered to numerous storms expected. 

There is some potential for a more organized line/cluster of storms
on the western side of the lake to move eastward across Lake
Michigan late in the evening and through the overnight hours.
Stronger flow aloft near the shortwave trough could support damaging
gust and brief tornado potential across parts of northern Lower
Michigan overnight. Higher severe probabilities could be needed if
confidence in this convective scenario increases in future outlooks.


...Upper OH valley...
Widespread thunderstorms are expected across the region in response
to a shortwave impulse. Modest instability is forecast amid a very
moist airmass. While vertical shear will remain fairly limited, some
slight enhancement near the upper trough could support a few
longer-lived storm clusters. Isolated strong gusts/wet microbursts
could occur, with the more intense storms.

...Northern Gulf Coast...
Scattered to numerous thunderstorms associated with Invest 93L will
occasionally move onshore across the northern/central Gulf Coast
Wednesday and Wednesday night. Enhancement of low and mid-level
easterly shear north of the weak surface circulation may support a
few longer-lived cells near the coast. Sporadic damaging gusts and
perhaps a brief tornado are possible, though confidence in this
convective scenario is very low.

NEBRASKA...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS SURROUNDING THE
SLIGHT RISK INTO THE UPPER MIDWEST...FOR NORTHERN AND EASTERN
WYOMING...AND NORTHERN UTAH AND SURROUNDING VICINITY...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe gusts (some 75+ mph) and large hail are probable
across parts of Nebraska late this afternoon and evening.  Scattered
severe gusts are also possible from the Upper Midwest to Utah and
Wyoming this afternoon to mid-evening.

...Northern/Central Plains to the Upper Midwest...
Primary focus for thunderstorms will be a slowly sagging,

Mesoscale Discussion 1670
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0318 PM CDT Mon Jul 14 2025

Areas affected...eastern Wyoming...southwestern South Dakota...and
Nebraska Panhandle

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 142018Z - 142215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storms are expected to increase in coverage and intensity
through the afternoon and evening.  Convective trends will be
monitored for the possibility of a severe thunderstorm watch.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms initiated early this afternoon over the
higher terrain of Wyoming, as ascent associated with an approaching
midlevel shortwave trough overspreads the area.  Continued
initiation over the higher terrain along with new initiation farther
east along the a surface pressure trough will eventually pose a
severe-weather threat later this afternoon and evening.  

Although low-level moisture is mixing out across much of the area
this afternoon (upper 40s to low 50s F 2-m Td), very steep low-level
and midlevel lapse rates (per 18Z UNR sounding) are still resulting
in over 1000 J/kg of MLCAPE.  The inverted-v thermodynamic profiles
across the region will support an isolated dry-microburst threat for
the strongest storms.  For a more organized severe threat,
deep-layer shear is marginally supportive and strongest (around 30
knots) with northward extent into northeastern Wyoming and
southwestern South Dakota.  The latest CAM guidance suggests some
potential for upscale growth of convection into clusters posing an
organized severe-wind threat.  Convective trends will be monitored
for this scenario and the possibility of a watch.

Mesoscale Discussion 1669
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0218 PM CDT Mon Jul 14 2025

Areas affected...southeastern Georgia into northern/central Florida

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 141918Z - 142145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected to increase in coverage and
intensity through the afternoon, posing an isolated threat of
damaging winds.  A severe thunderstorm watch is unlikely.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms have initiated on low-level convergence
boundaries across the region this afternoon in a hot, unstable
(~2500 J/kg MLCAPE) airmass.  While upper-tropospheric flow is weak
(per XMR 14Z sounding), enhanced low-to-midlevel northerly flow on
the west side of the low off the Atlantic coast may help storm
organization.  Local VWPs indicate around 25-30 knots of flow
between 700 and 500 mb, which may help to organize
southward-to-south-southwestward-propagating clusters as cold pools
begin to merge.  These storms will pose a damaging-wind threat this
afternoon, but the impacts are expected to be too isolated to
warrant a watch.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0329 AM CDT Mon Jul 14 2025

Valid 171200Z - 221200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Upper ridging will build across the south-central and southeastern
U.S. during the Day 4-8 period. This will confine a series of
low-amplitude upper troughs to the northern tier of the U.S. along
the international border. Bouts of strong to severe thunderstorm
potential will be possible through the period as individual
shortwaves provide modestly enhanced mid/upper westerly flow from
the northern Plains to the Great Lakes vicinity. Given the generally
low-amplitude nature the upper pattern across the northern U.S.
through at least Day 6 or 7/Sat or Sun, the main driver of severe
potential each day will be mesoscale features tied to prior days
convective evolution, not well resolved at longer time scales. As a
result, predictability is low.

Mesoscale Discussion 1664
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0341 PM CDT Sun Jul 13 2025

Areas affected...Parts of east TX into far southeast OK...northwest
LA...southwest/central AR

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 132041Z - 132245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Storms with locally damaging winds are possible through
the remainder of the afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Some increase in storm coverage and intensity has been
noted within a very moist and strongly buoyant environment across
east-central TX, along a composite outflow to the east of a
well-defined MCV over central TX. Deep-layer shear is relatively
weak, but modest southwesterly low/midlevel flow attendant to the
MCV and further outflow consolidation could result in a
northeastward-moving storm cluster that will move toward the
ArkLaTex region through the remainder of the afternoon. Such a
cluster could be accompanied by isolated damaging winds. Additional
storm development will be possible ahead of this developing cluster
into northeast TX and southwest AR, which may also be capable of
producing localized downbursts.

Mesoscale Discussion 1663
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0338 PM CDT Sun Jul 13 2025

Areas affected...southwestern New Mexico and southeastern Arizona

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 132038Z - 132315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storms are expected to increase in coverage and intensity
through the afternoon and into the evening, posing a severe wind
risk.  A severe thunderstorm watch is possible.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms have initiated over the high terrain this
afternoon across the region.  While moisture is meager for this time
of year, it is sufficient to support 500-1000 J/kg of MLCAPE and
robust updrafts.  The 18Z Tucson sounding represents the
characteristic well-mixed, inverted-V sounding profiles across the
region.  Certainly, this environment will support dry-microburst
potential for the strongest storms.  With northeasterly midlevel
flow expected to increase this afternoon and evening, a more
organized wind threat could develop and move south-southwestward off
the higher terrain.  Convective trends will continue to be monitored
for the possibility of watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1662
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0241 PM CDT Sun Jul 13 2025

Areas affected...Parts of central/eastern VA...central MD...the
eastern WV Panhandle

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 131941Z - 132115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated damaging wind remains possible through late
afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Earlier convection across MD and eastern VA has
generated a westward-moving outflow approaching central VA.
Meanwhile, other storms have developed this afternoon along/east of
the Blue Ridge. Deep-layer flow is quite weak across the region,
resulting in generally disorganized storms. However, strong heating
of a very moist airmass (PW around 2 inches) has resulted in MLCAPE
increasing above 3000 J/kg in areas outside of convective outflow.
The large PW and favorable buoyancy will support a threat of
localized wet microbursts, both with storms along the
westward-moving outflow, and the storms moving slowly eastward off
of the Blue Ridge. Outflow collisions may result in brief upticks in
storm intensity through the remainder of the afternoon.

0214 PM CDT Sun Jul 13 2025

Areas affected...eastern Florida peninsula

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 131914Z - 132145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected to continue developing and
moving southward through the afternoon posing an isolated damaging
wind threat.  A severe thunderstorm watch is unlikely.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms continue to develop along the eastern
peninsula of Florida in a very moist and unstable environment. 
While the deep-layer flow/shear is weak (per XMR 15Z sounding),
there does appear to be enhanced north-northwesterly low-level flow
likely associated with the midlevel low off the east coast of
Florida.  As a result, 0-3 km northerly shear is around 20 knots
(per MLB VWP), which is at least modestly supportive of
southward-propagating clusters capable of producing severe, damaging
wind gusts through the afternoon.  The localized, isolated nature of
the threat will preclude watch issuance.
