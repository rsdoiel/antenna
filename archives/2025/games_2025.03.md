## Marvel Snap down, caught in the TikTok ban

date: 2025-01-20, updated: 2025-01-20, from: Polygon Website

All focus was on TikTok in the last week, as the company prepared to — and eventually did — shut down its video-sharing app to adhere to a national security law explicitly aimed at the ByteDance-owned company.

## A weekend deal sent Skyrim rocketing back up the Steam charts

date: 2025-01-20, updated: 2025-01-20, from: Polygon Website

There’s life in the old dog yet.

The deal reduced the price of Skyrim’s updated Special Edition to just [&#8230;]

## Marvel Rivals player dedicates himself to its worst hero to prove she isn’t as bad as you think

date: 2025-01-20, updated: 2025-01-17, from: Polygon Website

Most Marvel Rivals tier lists agree: Scarlet Witch is one of the worst heroes to play if you plan on climbing the game’s competitive ranks. Like Moira in Overwatch, she’s devastating if left unchecked, but crumbles as soon as people know how to deal with her. In the highest ranks where the meta revolves around [&#8230;]

TikTok is “in the process of restoring service” in the United States after shutting down for a large portion of Sunday.

## Netflix revived and killed the interactive movie — but its platform is still a game

date: 2025-01-19, updated: 2025-01-17, from: Polygon Website

Game designer Sam Barlow deserves a lot of credit for driving the “redemption” of FMVs. The full-motion video game format was pioneered in the early ’90s as a cutting-edge visual technique in an age when computer graphics were more simplistic. But long before that, filmmakers were experimenting with ways to make films more interactive, in [&#8230;]

## Grand Theft Hamlet’s creators put Shakespeare in GTA to put chaos back into Shakespeare

date: 2025-01-19, updated: 2025-01-19, from: Polygon Website

Grand Theft Hamlet is a documentary film, kind of. It’s also an experimental theater project. It’s also a rough-and-ready feature-length machinima, made entirely in-game in Grand Theft Auto Online. It’s also a slapstick comedy of errors about three friends trying to fill an empty period in their lives by staging a production of William Shakespeare’s [&#8230;]
