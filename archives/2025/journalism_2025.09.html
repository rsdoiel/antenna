2025 Q&amp;A: ‘Nosferatu’ costume designer Linda Muir cuts her fangs
with first nomination</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-02, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>From capes to coffins, costume designer Linda Muir is resurrecting
Count Orlok’s wardrobe for the silver screen. Renowned for her
collaborations with director Robert Eggers on “The Witch” and “The
Lighthouse,” Muir has earned her first Academy Award nomination for Best
Costume Design for her work on “Nosferatu.” The black-and-white 1922
horror classic has transformed into a vibrant dark fantasy, adding color
to a colorless world with a reimagined wardrobe.</p>
