<p>date: 2025-01-09, from: Lost Arg Press blog</p>
<p>We spent the last couple months of 2024 working hard on our building
at 407 Madison Ave., an old woodworking tool factory that we are
restoring as our fulfillment center, retail store and editorial offices.
In addition to the staff and sub-contractors, we brought in Zach Haynes

Books Back</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-07, from: Lost Arg Press blog</p>
<p>This week I’ve signed off on a new press run of our four-volume set
of “The Woodworker: The Charles H. Hayward Years.” We ran out of stock

<p>The following is a portion of the introduction to Karvsnitt: Carving,
Pattern and Color in the Slöjd Tradition. Cutting patterns is a natural

symbols have decorated simple tools and utensils. During long winter
nights in front of the fire, symbolic patterns were carved into the
wood….</p>

<p>The below was written by our good friend Mattias Hallin, who lives in
Belgium (though he would, I think, want me to let you know he is
Swedish). You might recall that he is our non-resident expert in linseed
