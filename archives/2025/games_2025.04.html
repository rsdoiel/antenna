<p>date: 2025-01-27, updated: 2025-01-24, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>We’re back with another list of new game releases this week, and it’s
a whole buffet: You can nibble on a little psychological horror, scoop
up a heaping spoonful of sci-fi existentialism, or gorge on an
open-world action game finally making its way to PC. Whether you want
games that swallow your free time or […]</p>

fascists</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, updated: 2025-01-24, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>There’s an old saying that goes: “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”
However, few people know that this is usually followed by another adage:
“But if it’s already stale, don’t keep reheating it with an air fryer.”
Both statements are true for Sniper Elite: Resistance, the latest
installment in Rebellion’s third-person stealth and tactical […]</p>

<p>Dynamax Zapdos is the second Legendary we’re seeing in Max
Battles for Pokémon Go. It’s making its debut during Max Monday on
Jan. 27 from 6-7 p.m. and will be available until Feb. 3 when Dynamax

Gigantamax battles we’ve seen in the past, it […]</p>

<p>The Legend of Ochi premiered at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival. This
initial review was timed for its world premiere embargo. A child
befriending a creature everyone else thinks is too dangerous to befriend
is the backbone of many memorable coming-of-age stories, from Free Willy
and The Black Stallion to E.T. and How to Train […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-26, updated: 2025-01-24, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>The full-motion video game format was all the rage for a brief period
in the 1990s. The ability to play high-quality video — video! — on a
home computer was revolutionary.  But FMV games quickly fell by the
wayside. This was partially due to the rise of 3D graphics on more
powerful home consoles like […]</p>

excellent horror movies that reimagined the ghost story</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-26, updated: 2025-01-24, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Modern Hollywood’s foremost experimenter, Steven Soderbergh, has a
new movie out this week, and it’s all about ghosts. Presence, his
excellent new film and his first real foray into the horror genre, is
shot entirely from the perspective of a ghost who inhabits a house where
a new family has moved in. In the hands […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-26, updated: 2025-01-24, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Healers often get a raw deal in hero shooter games. Classes capable
of keeping players alive are critical, and can make the difference
between a team that wins and a team that loses. Despite risking life and
limb for teammates who may not deserve it, healers say they are rarely
appreciated. This axiom was true […]</p>

known for Metroidvanias Touhou Luna Nights and Record of Lodoss War:
Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth (and the Gradius homage Drainus), Team
Ladybug is attempting a new spin on the beloved action-exploration
