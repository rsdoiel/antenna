‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no greater laugh than when you‚Äôre at your most vulnerable.
You‚Äôre at a funeral, or you‚Äôre in church and something‚Äôs happening and
there‚Äôs great reprieve from the most human moments through humor. And
even in those moments, something is funny or human and fumbling. And
that scene itself [when Charles discovers Sazz‚Äôs ashes], when I was
watching it, I really felt like this scene is encapsulating the whole
experience of the best of this show for me when he is standing there and
then watching him wipe her ashes off and he‚Äôs in deep pain over it, but
caring so much. And then she pops in the doorway. I don‚Äôt know, things
like that just made me happy to have been able to do anything like
that,‚Äù says John Hoffman, co-creator and showrunner for <em>Only Murders
in the Building</em>, about balancing the humor and the grief in the
show.<br><br>In this episode, we go deep into Season 4 of <em>Only
Murders in the Building</em> with co-creator, showrunner and
writer/director John Hoffman. He talks about writing from theme, shares
details about that rip-roaring fight scene between Meryl Streep and
Melissa McCarthy, and exploring visual motifs this season.¬†<br><br>‚ÄúThe
twins and the reflections made me think of so many of my favorite films
and the way cinema is used to show reflections and to do parallels and
the Bergman-esque stuff. And I mean, granted, none of that might relate
to what you‚Äôre watching on this show. But playing off that theme felt
really good. We are a show that‚Äôs about three isolated, very lonely
people in New York City and finding connection and so I think that
recognition of we‚Äôre more alike than we‚Äôre apart also plays a huge part
in the telling of the stories of Season 4. I like organizing them that
way,‚Äù he says.¬†<br><br>Hoffman also shares his advice for writing great
scenes: ‚ÄúKnow what a scene is and know that a scene wants to move in a
certain way, and flip in a certain way. It might not take you in the
direction you thought it was going to, but sometimes it will give you
something of great comfort. Check yourself over and over again‚Ä¶ is it
honest? And check yourself on the truth of a character‚Äôs motivation.
Would a human being do that, ever? And if not, what could compel them to
do it? There are all those things that are just very basic to me,‚Äù he
says.¬†<br><br>To learn more about Hoffman‚Äôs writing process, listen to
the podcast.¬†<br><br><em>Please note: this episode contains mention of
suicide.¬†</em>

Whether or not you play video games, it‚Äôs no secret that movies and
television shows based on video games are big business. The most
lucrative of the videogame film adaptations has been Sega‚Äôs <em>Sonic
the Hedgehog</em>, with the first two films collectively banking over
$750 million worldwide,
<a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-release-date-2027-1236254778/">according
to Variety</a>. The franchise also spawned the Paramount+ series, <span
style="font-style: italic;">Knuckles</span>, featuring the voice of
Idris Elba, that came out earlier this year. Now <span
style="font-style: italic;">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</span> is out in
theaters and once again scoring big at the box office. Paramount has
announced that a fourth <span style="font-style: italic;">Sonic</span>
film is also in the works, set to release in 2027.<br><br>While all this
success may sound like a no-brainer due to the popularity of the
videogame that‚Äôs been a fan-favorite since 1991, the fact that <span
style="font-style: italic;">STH3</span> currently has a
<a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sonic_the_hedgehog_3">Rotten
Tomatoes score of 85%</a> proves that the latest film is a critical
success as well.¬†<br><br>Final Draft sat down with screenwriters Pat
Casey and Josh Miller to find out how they keep Sonic, the popular
whirling dervish of a hedgehog, going strong.

Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned or beginner screenwriter, some years are going
to be better than others. On a whole the film business has been
experiencing a lot of growing pains in recent years due to various
factors: a pandemic, a writer‚Äôs strike, changing technology and viewing
habits, etc. However, the industry is thriving in other areas, and a new
year can offer new opportunities.<br><br>As one year shifts into the
next, it‚Äôs a perfect time for a screenwriter to take stock of their

Except for children‚Äôs books, I can think of relatively few authors for
whom a relatively spare short story would be the occasion for a pricey
hardcover, but between the holiday gift-book market, the 20th
anniversary of <strong>Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell</strong>, and the
anticipation surrounding anything Susanna Clarke writes, one can hardly
blame Bloomsbury for

<p>‚ÄúIn most genre fiction where heroes and villains clash, the hero is
intrinsically reactive. The villain starts making trouble and that‚Äôs the
beginning of the story. If the villain had never showed up, the hero
would have lived a pleasant and unremarkable life and had a lovely time.
And nothing novel-worthy would have popped up. But the villain comes
along and does something terrible and that makes heroic action
necessary. So if that‚Äôs the function of the hero in the story, to be
called to heroic action, then the first conflict that‚Äôs readily
available to you is reluctance or a sense of being unworthy‚Ä¶ and then
after that, the hero will be called to take on a new shape and often
that will be in response to the shape of the danger, in response to the
shape of the wickedness a foot,‚Äù says Oscar-nominated screenwriter, Jon
Spaihts, about the classic hero-villain relationship in <em>Dune: Part
One</em>¬†and <em>Dune: Part Two</em>, based on the books by Frank
Herbert.¬† <br> <br>In this episode, Jon Spaihts talks about the
importance of hand-to-hand combat in mythic storytelling, his favorite
scene in <em>Dune: Part Two</em>, and we do a deep dive into his most
adored character, Lady Jessica, played by Rebecca Ferguson. We explore
the nature of her mystical powers and why she‚Äôs so feared by the men in
the story.¬† <br> <br>Spaihts also shares his advice about what it really
means to get personal with your writing.¬† <br> <br>‚ÄúWhen people say to
make your story personal, they don‚Äôt really mean look at yourself. You
are the least qualified person to say something meaningful about
yourself. What people are really talking about is that you should focus
on the things that obsess you. You can look at the things that are most
plangent to your feelings, that are most itchy and sticky for your
intellect, the things you can‚Äôt stop thinking about. You can focus on
the experiences that have impacted you most profoundly. Those things ‚Äì
the things that push on you and pull on you ‚Äì that is personal
storytelling. You look not at yourself, you look at the things that have
moved you, that have affected you, that have changed you, redirected
your life and the things that preoccupy you. Those are your seeds of
personal storytelling,‚Äù says Spaihts.¬† <br> <br>To hear more about
