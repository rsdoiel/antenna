## The Mediocrity of Modern Google

date: 2025-03-30, from: Om Malik blog

These days, whenever I think about Google, I recall a line from Madame Bovary. “She wanted to die, but she also wanted to live in Paris,” Flaubert writes, capturing Emma Bovary’s provincial reality and her romanticized dreams of escape. That is Google in a nutshell, isn’t it? The company that once represented the pinnacle of &#8230;

## IFSC Competition Regulations Para Climbing Events

date: 2025-03-30, from: Stubbornella Blog

The international federation of sport climbing released its 2025 paraclimbing regulations. The document was a PDF that was in accessible to screen readers so I converted it to HTML. It is far from perfect, but should be a lot better than the PDF. For some odd reason every bit of text on the PDF was [&#8230;]

## 2025-03-30 Don't visit the USA

date: 2025-03-30, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-03-30-don-t-visit-the-usa">2025-03-30 Don&rsquo;t visit the USA</h1>

<p>When people talk about minimal laptop installs, burner phones, and the
mess of US border crossings, I wonder where they habe been the last
twenty years. A dude from work flew to the states to work for HP as a
student, got turned back at the airport and put on a flight back. He
got to make one family call, his dad called HP, they called some
lawyers and by the time they go there he was already on a plane. And
those were the good days, before 9/11, Homeland Security and all that.</p>

<p>Have you seen the forms they have you sign on the Visa Waiver program?
The border agents have total discretion over you. Those are not &ldquo;passenger
rights&rdquo; but &ldquo;small mercies&rdquo;. And that was long before Trump. It&rsquo;s
terrible fuckery now, but it wasn&rsquo;t great before that. Not travelling
to the states? I&rsquo;ve told people at the office that I won&rsquo;t be going to
the states for work ever since 9/11. The last time I went happily was,
uh, when The Phantom Menace came out?</p>

<p>I went once more when
my wife wanted to go to Hawaii. Somebody there held my hand and
prayed for me on a parking lot. Somebody there gave me an ad for an
underground firing range. I learned how the US treated the locals. No,
visiting the US was never an easy call to make. And those were the
good days.</p>

<p>And what about boycotting the US? It is with despair that I see my
employer buying more and more into Windows and Microsoft and Azure and
Amazon S3. Have they not learned anything from Snowden? American IT is
not to be trusted. I mean, it&rsquo;s probably not be trusted anywhere, but
when give a choice, there is no reason to trust the USA. The agencies
can get all the information they want and hand out gag orders to prevent
the well-meaning corporations to warning you. From the outside, they
are just as bad as the rest of them. And they will use their power against
you. And Snowden was during the good years!</p>

<p>And yes, Fortress Europe is not great, either. Two things being not
great doesn&rsquo;t make a right, though. The first step is to realise how
bad the situation is, how bad the situation has been.</p>

<p>And now the situation really is fucked up.</p>

<p>If you look at the attempts at regime change in recent years,
I think the lessons are obvious: It can only succeed with long, weekly
mass demonstrations, in broad coalitions.</p>

<p>The only way out of a corrupt government
that controls access to jobs, controls the institutions, controls most
media is weekly protest. It takes a long time to grow. You have to
be there, every time. &ldquo;Pumpaj!” Keep the pressure up.</p>

<p>Join whatever protest is on this week.</p>

<p>I also think it is important to not conflate the man with the mob.
Name no names! Because it’s never just one person. If it looks like
one person then that person is the face man of the mob. The people that
need kicking are all those that got their jobs from the mob. All these
greedy incompetents whose only qualification is how far they can bend
over.</p>

<p>Yeet them into the sun. Send them off to Mars. Whatever.</p>

<p>To think that Canadians or Greenlanders want to be part of the USA is
about as absurd to me as Taiwanese wanting to be part of mainland China
or Ukrainians wanting to be part of Russia. The only ones not getting it
are the sympathisers of the dread regimes in China, in Russia &ndash; and in the USA.</p>

## When AI Whispers in Ink

As one month ends and another begins, I find myself performing what has become a private ritual with two pens from my unusually large collection of fountain pens. These are not the sober instruments that sign checks or pen manuscripts—those steadfast companions are already loaded with respectable blues and blacks, the colors of responsibility. These &#8230;

This is a moment. I no longer have to beg for this. It exists. So the first step has already been taken, thank goodness!!!

## Miscellany № 107: old books (and a new Book)

date: 2025-03-29, from: Shady Characters blog

<p>Some big news today: <a href="/books/the-book"><cite>The Book: A Cover-to-Cover Exploration of the Most Powerful Object of our Time</cite></a> will be published soon in paperback!</p>
<p>The paperback edition is updated from the hardback, with all of the various <a href="https://shadycharacters.co.uk/books/the-book/errata-for-the-book/">errata</a> fixed and a number of changes made to account for the book’s paperback rather than hardcover construction.  If you remember, the hardback edition had a number of references to its own physical form (“Tip the book towards you and look at the spine”, and so on) which have now been modified accordingly. Of course, the paperback edition provides a new and different set of reference points, so if some passages now ask you to find a hardback on your bookshelf, others can now tell you to look again at the paperback in your hands.</p><a class="more-link" href="https://shadycharacters.co.uk/2025/03/miscellany-107-book-paperback/">Read more →</a>

## 2025-03-28 Locarno Camellia park

date: 2025-03-28, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-03-28-locarno-camellia-park">2025-03-28 Locarno Camellia park</h1>

<p>It’s spring and we went there. Locarno is in the canton Ticino, in the south of Switzerland, at the shores of Lago Maggiore (“big lake”) that it shares with Italy.</p>

<p>They have a fantastic camellia park. In early spring, it&rsquo;s the best place to be.</p>

<p>I tried to take pictures with my trusty Olympus EP-5 and the 30mm 1:3.5 macro lens. Sadly, I have been untrained by the phone and was confused by the settings and the tiny screen. Oh my! So this is mix of camera pictures and phone pictures.</p>

## We had it all on the web, and we will again

date: 2025-03-28, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>When we flatten out the differences between the different social networks, we'll start with their RSS feeds, if it works, ultimately there will be no need for different social networks. And again, if it works, we'll bring back the features of the open web that Twitter left out.</p>
<p>This is a much better approach to federation, delivers the benefits long before hashing out the diffs betw ATP and ActivityPub will take. And we really have the choice that Bluesky says they will deliver, and yes, it will also be billionaire-proof.</p>

## DIY PTP Grandmaster Clock with a Raspberry Pi

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">DIY PTP Grandmaster Clock with a Raspberry Pi</span>

            <blockquote>
  <p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: I set up an open source <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/time-pi">Time Pi project</a> to build a stratum 1 PTP and NTP timeserver using a Raspberry Pi.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Time is important to modern society, and most of us have a clock on our wrist that's more accurate than at any time in human history. But <em>highly precise</em> time is important in many industries, especially robotics, finance, and media production. And with tech like VR working its way into homes, precise time may become more important <em>there</em>, too.</p>

<p>The timing industry has many solutions for 'grandmaster' clocks, which take in highly accurate time from GPS, GNSS, or other atomic-clock-backed time sources, and distribute it to local networks with <em>extreme</em> precision—down to the nanosecond range—using PTP.</p>

## Is software art?

date: 2025-03-28, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I believe it is. When people say my software thinks like they do, what's really happening is the software has gotten out of their way, they've incorporated the way it works into the base of their spine, so they can remain in the world they're writing about, and forget that they're using a piece of software. They perceive that as the software thinking like they do, which is fine -- it's the goal. But it's quite possible they have a totally different experience that takes them out of their suspension of disbelief by not working the way they expect, the same way it did the last 100 times, or it failes to open a file, or whatever might cause them to leave their own world and have to deal with the one I, and generations of software developers, have created, which can (as I know) be excruciating, humiliating, and whatever else you may feel. </p>

## What is art?

date: 2025-03-28, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Yesterday I <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/03/27/131121.html">posted</a> four new ChatGPT-created drawings, created with the latest upgrade of ChatGPT's drawing functions which are better than previous versions. The usual controversy is rekindled on the networks. The concern as always is that it learned how from human artists, puts artists out of business, and human artists create art, machines can't, and since this is created by software, it isn't art. </p>
<p>This gives me a chance to write a piece I've been wanting to write for a while. The meaning of art imho comes from what it says to and about the person observing it, what it does to them, how it changes them, what they experience. For most people, most of the time, they don't have any idea who created the art beyond their name, nationality and when they lived. If you see enough of their work, you learn about the work, not the person. What you learn from art is always going to be about yourself.  </p>
<p>My father once told me, in all seriousness, the cliche about an abstract work of art -- it isn't art, my father said. I said to him, Dad that you feel so strongly about it means to you it most definitely <i>is</i> art. I believe if he were more truthful about his response, he would say what's behind the feeling, he's experiencing dishonesty, stolen valor, the artist is a profiteer, the person who made it a <i>con</i> artist not a real artist. Pretty similar to what people say in 2025 about art-making machines. </p>

## AIs as Trusted Third Parties

date: 2025-03-28, updated: 2025-03-27, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>This is a truly fascinating paper:  &#8220;<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08970">Trusted Machine Learning Models Unlock Private Inference for Problems Currently Infeasible with Cryptography</a>.&#8221; The basic idea is that AIs can act as trusted third parties:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> We often interact with untrusted parties. Prioritization of privacy can limit the effectiveness of these interactions, as achieving certain goals necessitates sharing private data. Traditionally, addressing this challenge has involved either seeking <em>trusted intermediaries</em> or constructing <em>cryptographic protocols</em> that restrict how much data is revealed, such as multi-party computations or zero-knowledge proofs. While significant advances have been made in scaling cryptographic approaches, they remain limited in terms of the size and complexity of applications they can be used for. In this paper, we argue that capable machine learning models can fulfill the role of a trusted third party, thus enabling secure computations for applications that were previously infeasible. In particular, we describe Trusted Capable Model Environments (TCMEs) as an alternative approach for scaling secure computation, where capable machine learning model(s) interact under input/output constraints, with explicit information flow control and explicit statelessness. This approach aims to achieve a balance between privacy and computational efficiency, enabling private inference where classical cryptographic solutions are currently infeasible. We describe a number of use cases that are enabled by TCME, and show that even some simple classic cryptographic problems can already be solved with TCME. Finally, we outline current limitations and discuss the path forward in implementing them...</p></blockquote>

Joel Wallenberg interviewed me on 14<sup>th</sup> February for his article in the 28<sup>th</sup> February edition of <a href="https://www.grantspub.com/"><i>Grant's Interest Rate Observer</i></a> entitled <i>Memo to the bitcoiners</i>. Alas, it is paywalled, but among the many quotes from me Wallenberg used was that blockchain-based systems "are very vulnerable to supply-chain attacks".<br />
<br />
Exactly a week after the interview and a week before the article went to press, we got an example, the <a href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=bybit-hack">biggest cryptocurrency heist in history</a>. Below the fold I discuss the details.<br />

Among the countries the US recently <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7435pnle0go">voted with in the UN General Assembly</a> is the Democratic Peoples' Republic of Korea (DPRK). The US administration may have been impressed with the DPRK's innovative, diversified business model. This includes divisions responsible for supporting the Russian invasion of Ukraine with <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/31/europe/ukraine-russia-kursk-north-korean-troops-intl/index.html">soldiers</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/28/asia/north-korea-munitions-factories-shipments-russia-ukraine-intl-hnk/index.html">arms</a>, <a href="https://boingboing.net/2021/06/21/how-north-korea-perfected-counterfeiting-100-bills.html">counterfeiting $100 bills</a>, <a href="https://www.armyupress.army.mil/Portals/7/Hot%20Spots/Documents/North-Korea/Hurst-North-Korea.pdf">drug smuggling</a>, and trafficking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illicit_activities_of_North_Korea">wildlife and humans</a>. One of the most profitable divisions is responsible for stealing cryptocurrencies, and on 21<sup>st</sup> February it had a major success by stealing Ethereum with a notional value of $1.5B from the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/02/how-north-korea-pulled-off-a-1-5-billion-crypto-heist-the-biggest-in-history/">Bybit exchange</a>.<br />
<br />
<i>The Economist</i> asks <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2025/03/19/why-are-north-korean-hackers-such-good-crypto-thieves"><i>Why are North Korean hackers such good crypto-thieves?</i></a> It is a good question because:<br />
<blockquote>
n 2023 North Korean hackers made away with a total of $661m, according to Chainalysis, a crypto-investigations firm; they doubled the sum in 2024, racking up $1.34bn across 47 separate heists, an amount equivalent to more than 60% of the global total of stolen crypto. The ByBit operation indicates a growing degree of skill and ambition: in a single hack, North Korea swiped the equivalent of $1.5bn from the exchange, the largest-ever heist in the history of cryptocurrency.

The reason is that they are a mainstay of the <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2025/03/19/why-are-north-korean-hackers-such-good-crypto-thieves">DPRK's economy</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Crypto-thievery is a more efficient way to earn hard currency than traditional sources, such as overseas labourers or illegal drugs. The United Nations Panel of Experts (UNPE), a monitoring body, reported in 2023 that cyber-theft accounted for half of North Korea’s foreign-currency revenue. North Korea’s digital plunder last year was worth more than three times the value of its exports to China, its main trade partner. “You take what took millions of labourers, and you can replicate that with the work of a few dozen people,” says Mr Carlsen.
</blockquote>
The attribution of the Bybit theft to the DPRK is convincing, because the <i>modus operandi</i> was very similar to last October's theft of <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-eu-throws-a-hand-grenade-on-software-liability">$50M from Radiant Capital's multisig cold wallet</a>. Radiant <a href="https://medium.com/@RadiantCapital/radiant-post-mortem-fecd6cd38081">reported</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Attackers were able to compromise the devices of at least these three core contributors through a sophisticated malware injection. These compromised devices were then used to sign malicious transactions.<br />
<br />
Although three compromised devices have been confirmed, it is likely that more were targeted — the means by which they were compromised remains unknown and under investigation. The devices were compromised in such a way that the front-end of <a href="https://app.safe.global/welcome">Safe{Wallet}</a> (f.k.a. Gnosis Safe) displayed legitimate transaction data while malicious transactions were signed and executed in the background.
</blockquote>
This is kind of like Obi-Wan Kenobi's "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1rlThKe1qo">These aren't the droids you're looking for</a>".<br />
<br />
Radiant was being careful. They used Safe{Wallet} to implement a multi-sig wallet, which required at least three signatures to authorize a transaction. And they <a href="https://medium.com/@RadiantCapital/radiant-post-mortem-fecd6cd38081">checked the transactions carefully</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Each transaction was simulated for accuracy on Tenderly and individually reviewed by multiple developers at each signature stage. Front-end checks in both <a href="https://tenderly.co/transaction-simulator">Tenderly</a> and Safe showed no anomalies during these reviews.<br />
<br />
To underscore the significance of this point, the compromise was <b>completely undetectable</b> during the manual review of the Gnosis Safe UI and Tenderly simulation stages of the routine transaction.

<a href="https://app.safe.global/welcome">Safe{Wallet}</a> is an open-source Web app that creates and manages access to multi-sig wallets. In effect it interposes a user interface layer above the Ethereum blockchain.  Last May Alex Miguel's <a href="https://milkroad.com/reviews/safe-wallet/"><i>Safe Wallet Review 2025: Pros, Cons, &amp; Features</i></a> complimented the UI:<br />
<blockquote>
The UI for a Safe is clean and intuitive. You can browse the assets in the safe easily, as well as check and manage the participating addresses. 
</blockquote>
The nature of the Ethereum ecosystem means that this user interface has <a href="https://medium.com/@RadiantCapital/radiant-post-mortem-fecd6cd38081">some issues</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Front-end verification of all three multi-signature transactions showed no signs of compromise, aside from Safe App transaction resubmissions due to failures. It is important to highlight that resubmitting Safe transactions due to failures is a common and expected occurrence. Transactions submitted on the Safe front-end can fail due to gas price fluctuations, nonce mismatch, network congestion, insufficient gas limit, smart contract execution errors, token insufficiency, pending transactions, front-end synchronization issues, timeouts, or permission/signature errors in multi-signature setups. As a result, this behavior did not raise immediate suspicion. The malicious actors exploited this normalcy, using the process to collect multiple compromised signatures over several attempts, all while mimicking the appearance of routine transaction failures.
</blockquote>
It is important to note that, at the time they were writing, Radiant did not know <i>how</i> the developer's devices were compromised to sign the malicious transactions. They did set out a list of precautions which, I believe, would have prevented the subsequent Bybit heist, <a href="https://medium.com/@RadiantCapital/radiant-post-mortem-fecd6cd38081">in particular</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Take raw transaction data out of your wallet provider when a signature is prompted (e.g., Metamask, Rabby) and plug it into <a href="https://etherscan.io/inputdatadecoder">https://etherscan.io/inputdatadecoder</a>. Confirm that the function you are calling, and the ToAddress all match up with the intended behavior. If a device were to be compromised, like in the case above, it would either not decode at all, call a different function than the one you thought you were calling, or it would result in a different owner address than the one you intended.

The most comprehensive analysis of the Bybit heist I found was Cyfrin's <a href="https://www.cyfrin.io/blog/safe-wallet-hack-bybit-exploit"><i>The Safe Wallet Hack That Led to Bybit’s $1.4B Heist</i></a>. In summary, the attackers:<br />
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Compromised a developer machine at Safe</li>
<li>Injected malicious JavaScript into a development container</li>
<li>Specifically targeted Bybit exchange to stay undetected longer</li>
<li>Manipulated what Bybit signers saw in the Safe interface</li>
</ol>
...<br />
This represents a sophisticated supply chain attack rather than a direct compromise of end-user devices.<br />
<br />
This attack followed an almost identical pattern to recent attacks on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_WazirX_hack">WazirX Exchange</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/radiant-capital-hack-how-hackers-used-a-pdf-to-steal-50-million/">Radiant Capital</a>. This suggests that the same threat actors are repeatedly using this technique successfully.<br />
<br />
It's now believed that the Safe UI was the compromise point in all these cases rather than end-user machines, which explains the similar attack patterns.
</blockquote>
Because the attackers had access to the Safe developer's machine, they had access to one of Safe's S3 buckets, from which the Safe code running on the machines at Bybit downloaded the malware.<br />
<br />
According to Thanh Nguyen of Verichains' <a href="https://coinacademy.fr/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bybit-Incident-Investigation-Report.pdf">preliminary report</a>:<br />
<blockquote> 
By examining the machines of three Signers from Bybit, malicious JavaScript payload from app.safe.global was discovered in the Google Chrome cache files.<br />
<br />
There are two javascript files that were modified: _app-52c9031bfa03da47.js and 6514.b556851795a4cbaa.js.<br />
...<br />
From the Wayback Archive (https://web.archive.org/), we also identified an instance of this malicious JavaScript file dating back to Feb 19, 2025 17:29:05
</blockquote>
The malware was planted on 19<sup>th</sup> February around 17:29 GMT, and removed about 2 minutes after the heist on 21<sup>st</sup> February at 14:15 GMT.<br />
<br />
Later the same day, <a href="https://x.com/arkham/status/1893033424224411885">@zachxbt</a> attributed the heist to the DPRK's Lazarus Group:<br />
<blockquote>
At 19:09 UTC today, <a href="https://x.com/zachxbt">@zachxbt</a> submitted definitive proof that this attack on Bybit was performed by the LAZARUS GROUP.<br />
<br />
His submission included a detailed analysis of test transactions and connected wallets used ahead of the exploit, as well as multiple forensics graphs and timing analyses.<br />
<br />
The submission has been shared with the Bybit team in support of their investigation. We wish them all the best.
</blockquote>
Cyfrin agrees with Radiant's <a href="https://www.cyfrin.io/blog/safe-wallet-hack-bybit-exploit">key precaution</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Bybit’s team trusted what they saw on their screens, and Safe’s engineering team trusted that their systems were secure.<br />
<br />
“Don’t trust, verify” has become a blockchain mantra for a reason.<br />
<br />
When the signers reviewed the transaction but did not verify the calldata on their physical hardware devices, everything appeared correct. This underscores the critical need for thorough transaction verification beyond what’s displayed on the screen.<br />
<br />
To spell it out, the computers showed a spoofed transaction that tricked them, but their wallets showed the malicious transaction. They could have caught this on the hardware wallet, but as of today, calldata can be tricky to verify on a wallet.
</blockquote>
It is likely that the Safe developer's machine was compromised via a phishing attack. That was the <i>modus operandi</i> for the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/radiant-capital-hack-how-hackers-used-a-pdf-to-steal-50-million/">Radiant heist</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The attack began on Sept. 11, when a Radiant Capital developer received a Telegram message from someone impersonating a trusted former contractor. According to the message, the contractor was looking for a new job opportunity in smart contract audits. It requested comments on the contractor’s work and provided a link to a compressed PDF detailing their next assignment. The hackers even mimicked the contractor’s legitimate website to add credibility.<br />
<br />
The zip file contained a disguised executable named INLETDRIFT. Upon opening, it installed malware on the developer’s macOS device, granting attackers access to the developer’s system. The malware was designed to communicate with a hacker-controlled server.
</blockquote>
The security of a multi-billion dollar exchange depended upon the developers at a software supplier not clicking on a link in a Telegram message.<br />
<br />
The new US administration's enthusiasm for <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/issue-78/">grifts such as cryptocurrencies</a> means the outlook for the DPRK's cryptocurrency division <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2025/03/19/why-are-north-korean-hackers-such-good-crypto-thieves">is rosy</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Tackling the problem requires multilateral efforts across governments and the private sector, but such collaboration has been fraying. Russia used its UN veto to gut the UNPE last year. President Donald Trump’s cuts to American development aid have hit programmes aimed at building cyber-security capacity in vulnerable countries.<br />
<br />
By contrast, the North Korean regime is throwing ever more resources at cybercrime. South Korea’s intelligence services reckon its cybercrime force grew from 6,800 people in 2022 to 8,400 last year. As the crypto-industry expands in countries with weaker regulatory oversight, North Korea has an increasingly “rich target environment”, says Abhishek Sharma of the Observer Research Foundation, an Indian think-tank. Last year, Mr Sharma notes, North Korea attacked exchanges based in India and Indonesia.

Two weeks after the article that quoted me appeared, the front page of <i>Grant's Interest Rate Observer</i> summed the situation up with this pithy cartoon, which I use with permission. The 28<sup>th</sup> March edition featured another excellent cryptocurrency-focused article entitled <i>The two lives of Donald J. Trump</i>:<br />
<blockquote>
Crypto prices are prone to crashes &mdash; one could say that crypto exchanges are designed to facilitate them. It would be strange if the immensity of the market caps involved did not introduce a new element of risk into a world that hardly needs more. As for America’s multitasking president, he boasted (through his lawyer) in 2019 that he could commit murder on Fifth Avenue in broad daylight and not be charged with a crime.  A conflict of interest is no capital crime, but Trump continues to mix the business of state with the pleasures and temptations of money-making.
</blockquote>
The article features extensive quotes from the wonderful <a href="https://www.coalexander.com/">Prof. Carol Alexander</a> about the problem of "rehypothecation" in DeFi:<br />
<blockquote>
One can borrow up to 78.5% loan-to-value on Aave against the special tokens and make an interest spread of 29 basis points by staking the newly borrowed ether. Starting with 100 ETH, for instance, one could stake them (earning 3%), use the automatically generated liquid staking tokens to borrow 78 more ETH, stake those to earn a net 29 basis points, use the resulting 78 more liquid staking tokens to borrow 78% of 78, i.e., 61, more ether, stake them for another 29 basis points and so on. ...  In fact, an enterprising decentralized financier will need to iterate the borrowing and staking process 12 times until he is levered 4.5 times, having borrowed 3.5 ether tokens for each originally laid out, before the resulting digital hoard will even break 4% in yield,
</blockquote>
This all sounds great until the price of the collateral drops, perhaps in one of the flash crashes to which cryptocurrencies are subject:<br />
<blockquote>
On May 19, 2021, a flash crash in multiple cryptocurrencies briefly knocked more than 25% off the price of bitcoin and 34% off the price of ether before the prices recovered somewhat, all inside of an hour.
</blockquote>
In minutes the collateral will be liquidated automatically, and if that doesn't clear the position, so will any other assets the exchange can get its hands on. The article quotes Alexander:<br />
<blockquote>
the entire portfolio, not just in ether, but all the other positions, will get taken out by the exchange. The exchange is not supposed to sell these things straight away. They have things called “guarantee funds” or “insurance funds,” which are supposed to absorb the liquidated positions [and hold them].  But they don’t. They dump them into the market. I’ve got all the data to show that.
</blockquote>
This is the business into which Trump's World Liberty Financial wants to get:<br />
<blockquote>
“With World Liberty Financial [Trump] stands to make billions. . . . They want to provide lending and borrowing services like Aave. Aave is the biggest shadow bank [in decentralized finance],” Alexander explains, representing a market for crypto-token deposits and loans worth $29.1 billion.

## A new ChatGPT drawing tool

<p>ChatGPT's drawing function has gotten a huge upgrade. I've been doing tests for the last 24 hours. </p>
<p>First I gave it a screen shot of WordLand and asked for a nice colorful poster for the product. Then I had it make a movie poster for Mutiny on the Bounty with different actors, and As Good as it Gets, and then a stunning rendering of an El Salvador news photo in the style of Edward Hopper. It refused to do an R Crumb rendering or Doonesbury, but it was OK with Hopper.</p>

## 2025-03-20 Something about the bot defence is working

date: 2025-03-26, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-03-20-something-about-the-bot-defence-is-working">2025-03-20 Something about the bot defence is working</h1>

<p>At midnight, there was a surge in activity.
CPU usage went up.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-03-20-bot-defence-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Load went up, too. But it stayed within reasonable bounds &ndash; less than 4 instead of the more than 80 I have seen in the past.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-03-20-bot-defence-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And the number of IP addresses blocked by <code>fail2ban</code> went from 40 to 50.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-03-20-bot-defence-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m usually sceptical of this because the big attacks are from a far wider variety of IP numbers.
In this case, however, maybe there was some probing that resulted in blocks? I don&rsquo;t know. Lucky, I guess?</p>

<p>In any case, the site is still up. Yay for small wins.</p>

<p>Also, I cannot overstate how good it feel to have some <a href="https://munin-monitoring.org/">Munin</a> graphs available.</p>

<p><code>alex-bots</code> is a setup I desribed in <a href="2025-02-19-bots-again">2025-02-19 Bots again, cursed</a>.
Basically a request to one of my Oddmuse wikis containing the parameter <code>rcidonly</code> is an expensive endpoint: &ldquo;all changes for this single page&rdquo; or &ldquo;a feed for this single page&rdquo;. This is something a human would rarely access and yet it somehow the URLs landed in some dataset for AI training, I suspect. So what I do is I’m redirecting any request containing “rcidonly” in the query string to <code>/nobots</code>, warning humans not to click on these links.</p>

<p>In addition to that, the filter <code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/alex-bots.conf</code> contains this:</p>

<pre><code>[Definition]
failregex = ^(www\.emacswiki\.org|communitywiki\.org|campaignwiki\.org):[0-9]+ &lt;HOST&gt; .*rcidonly=
</code></pre>

<p>And I added a section using this filter to my jail <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/alex.conf</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[alex-bots]
enabled = true
port    = http,https
logpath = %(apache_access_log)s
findtime = 3600
maxretry = 2
</code></pre>

<p>So if an IP number visits three URLs containing &ldquo;rcidonly&rdquo; in an hour, they get banned for ten minutes.</p>

<p>The <code>recidive</code> filter (a standard filter you just need to activate) then makes sure that any IP number that got blocked three times gets blocked for a week.</p>

<p><strong>2025-03-20</strong>. Ever since Drew DeVault published his blog post, more people seem to notice what&rsquo;s going on: AI ingestion is killing web sites and web services.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you think these crawlers respect <code>robots.txt</code> then you are several assumptions of good faith removed from reality. These bots crawl everything they can find, <code>robots.txt</code> be damned, including expensive endpoints like git blame, every page of every git log, and every commit in every repo, and they do so using random User-Agents that overlap with end-users and come from tens of thousands of IP addresses – mostly residential, in unrelated subnets, each one making no more than one HTTP request over any time period we tried to measure – actively and maliciously adapting and blending in with end-user traffic and avoiding attempts to characterize their behavior or block their traffic. &ndash; <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2025/03/17/2025-03-17-Stop-externalizing-your-costs-on-me.html">Please stop externalizing your costs directly into my face</a>, by Drew DeVault, for SourceHut</p>

<p>Then, yesterday morning, KDE GitLab infrastructure was overwhelmed by another AI crawler, with IPs from an Alibaba range; this caused GitLab to be temporarily inaccessible by KDE developers. I then discovered that, one week ago, an Anime girl started appearing on the GNOME GitLab instance, as the page was loaded. It turns out that it&rsquo;s the default loading page for Anubis, a proof-of-work challenger that blocks AI scrapers that are causing outages. &ndash; <a href="https://thelibre.news/foss-infrastructure-is-under-attack-by-ai-companies/">FOSS infrastructure is under attack by AI companies</a>, by Niccolò Venerandi, for LibreNews</p>

<p>What do SourceHut, GNOME’s GitLab, and KDE’s GitLab have in common, other than all three of them being forges? Well, it turns out all three of them have been dealing with immense amounts of traffic from “AI” scrapers, who are effectively performing DDoS attacks with such ferocity it’s bringing down the infrastructures of these major open source projects. Being open source, and thus publicly accessible, means these scrapers have unlimited access, unlike with proprietary projects. … Everything about this “AI” bubble is gross, and I can’t wait for this bubble to pop so a semblance of sanity can return to the technology world. Until the next hype train rolls into the station, of course. &ndash; <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/141969/foss-infrastructure-is-under-attack-by-ai-companies/">FOSS infrastructure is under attack by AI companies</a>, by Thom Holwerda, for OSnews</p>

<p><strong>2025-03-22</strong>. Ordinary sysadmins get hit as well. Here&rsquo;s Sean Conner of the The Boston Diaries: He reports on <a href="https://boston.conman.org/2025/03/21">Friday, March 21, 2025</a> that his logs show a total of 468439 requests for February 2025. The top hitter was 4.231.104.62 with 43242 requests (9%). This was from MICROSOFT-CORP-MSN-AS-BLOCK, US. But the ASN has more networks, of course. Adding them all up give 78889 (17%).</p>

<p>He links to the <a href="https://www.team-cymru.com/ip-asn-mapping">IP to ASN Mapping Service</a> by Team Cymru. I started switching my <a href="/admin/network-lookup">network-lookup</a> script to using it because it also supports IPv6. Something that I haven&rsquo;t done is find the ASN and then block all the blocks belonging to the ASN. That&rsquo;s where I want to be, actually.</p>

<p><strong>2025-03-26</strong>. More media are picking it up, but with a strange focus on &ldquo;open source&rdquo;.</p>

## Join a parade today

date: 2025-03-26, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>This morning‘s <a href="https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/03/26/join-a-parade-today/">early morning missive</a> from WordLand..</p>
<p>Talking with friends about What To Do.</p>
<p>I actually have an idea.</p>
<p>We all try to lead a parade, with a big viral idea, if only everyone would follow me, it might just work. A lot of us have that feeling. My advice — it doesn’t work. Lose it. Instead, find a parade you can join, and add your energy, talent and experience to it.</p>
<p>We have a tremendous oversupply of would-be parade leaders, we need to build momentum, and it doesn’t really matter what it is or who leads it. As long as it’s something the press can cover. A movement that begets more motion. A huge march in DC. Demonstrations at Tesla dealers. Blogging in a group. Helping an existing group route around an outage. Making a great list of causes others can join. Reading a blog and finding the thing the blogger is looking for. And so on.</p>
<p>There’s great satisfaction in joining a righteous cause that’s working, my bother, my sister.</p>
<p>This goes back to something observed in standards work. The standard is set by the person who goes second, not the one who goes first. The person who chooses to interop instead of blazing a new incompatible trail. We should celebrate people who support others as much as we do the one who goes first. You need both, and the thirds and fourth adopters to create a movement.</p>
<p>At a time like now when there’s no room for error or individual ego, as Ben Franklin’s so wisely said during America’s revolution, we must all hang together or most assuredly we will all hang separately.</p>
<p>PS: One way facebook can cripple a nascent movement, by the algorithm not showing you parades you might like too much. Remember Zuck is trying to ingratiate himself to trump. I find I’m seeing posts of vital interest to me over 24 hours after they were posted, when 165 people have already liked it. Suspicious behavior. We need to own our own social net. </p>
<p>PPS: This philosophy led me to build on WordPress as a foundation, instead of building my own, which I am fully capable of. It’s working much better this way, so far. Could the be a way toward our own social net? Possibly.</p>

## Doc's approach to WordLand

date: 2025-03-26, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Watching Doc Searls use WordLand to post to his <a href="https://doc.searls.com/">WordPress blog</a>. </p>
<p>He's using it the way <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+manila&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS743US747&oq=site%3Ascripting.com+manila&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.4100j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">Manila</a> worked for blogging in the late 90s early 00s. Every day is a new page, which contained as many items as you liked. When you add a blank line that starts a new post. It's Markdown kind of a approach to structuring text. </p>
<p>There's a point where you click the <i>Flip Home Page</i> button. You can do that once a day. Each day is a fresh start. Each day gets its own archive page. The software can automate some of that, but it's trivial to do it by hand. A nice daily ritual. </p>
<p>The RSS feed we generated looked for two Returns in the text, that started a new &lt;item>.</p>
<p>Manila eventually adopted Blogger's approach, but I always liked this way because it said a blog post can be a very small thing. That was certainly the way I write. Some ideas don't require a lot of writing, so why should they take up so much space? I'm trying to make sure that as WordLand evolves, it treats little things and big things with equal respect. </p>
<p>Basically Doc is doing manually what Manila did for you, but it's not a lot of work, he just clicks the + icon to create a new post, when he wants a fresh start. He has to choose a site from a popup, and then he's ready to write. The advantage is he has them all arrayed for him to make a change where ever he likes. I have that when I write in Drummer. </p>
<p>He's not getting the benefit of the RSS treatment in Manila. Both WordPress and WordLand see that as one post, not N posts. </p>
<p>Below is a screen shot of Docs blog, and below it, in contrast is a page generated by Manila in 2001.</p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/03/26/docsBlogScreen.png"></center>A screen shot of a <a href="https://doc.searls.com/2025/03/25/there-they-go/">day</a> in the life of Doc's new blog.</div></p>

## AI Data Poisoning

date: 2025-03-26, updated: 2025-03-25, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Cloudflare has a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/cloudflare-turns-ai-against-itself-with-endless-maze-of-irrelevant-facts/">new feature</a>&#8212;available to free users as well&#8212;that uses AI to generate random pages to feed to AI web crawlers:</p>
<blockquote><p>Instead of simply blocking bots, Cloudflare&#8217;s new system lures them into a &#8220;maze&#8221; of realistic-looking but irrelevant pages, wasting the crawler&#8217;s computing resources. The approach is a notable shift from the standard block-and-defend strategy used by most website protection services. Cloudflare says blocking bots sometimes backfires because it alerts the crawler&#8217;s operators that they&#8217;ve been detected.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we detect unauthorized crawling, rather than blocking the request, we will link to a series of AI-generated pages that are convincing enough to entice a crawler to traverse them,&#8221; writes Cloudflare. &#8220;But while real looking, this content is not actually the content of the site we are protecting, so the crawler wastes time and resources.&#8221;...</p></blockquote>

<p>Israel is continuing its genocide against the Palestinians.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesca_Albanese">Fanscesca Albanese</a> is saying all the right things but people keep arming and Israel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo; to believe that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territories said on Tuesday. &ndash; <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/03/1147976">Rights expert finds ‘reasonable grounds’ genocide is being committed in Gaza</a></p>

<p>Russia is continuing its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War">invasion of Ukraine</a>.
I&rsquo;m following <a href="https://meduza.io/en">Meduza</a> for news from Russia.
I don&rsquo;t know what to do. But seizing Russian assets and supporting Ukraine should be at the obvious thing to do.
Remember the news in 2014:</p>

Today Kyiv feels betrayed - and not merely by Moscow. &ndash; <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/ukraines-forgotten-security-guarantee-the-budapest-memorandum/a-18111097">Ukraine&rsquo;s forgotten security guarantee</a>, by Roman Goncharenko / bw, for DW</p>

We really do have a problem honoring the achievements of white men. I know because I get the bullshit when people have tried to honor me for my achievements. When I was offered a keynote spot a the <a href="https://isoj.org/symposia/2019/">ISOJ conference in 2019</a>, to honor my (then) 25 years of blogging, I told the show runner, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosental_Alves">Rosental Alves</a>,  that his audience wouldn't like me. He is gentle generous person, so I believe he was genuinely puzzled. I decided to go, because a future of journalism conference that thinks the advent of blogs was something for journalists and journalism students to acknowledge was something I wanted to see. But in the Q&A period, it all came out. Bluntly and rudely. My contributions mean nothing because I am a white man and in their minds I couldn't have failed. Do they really believe that? Swimming upstream isn't easy for anyone. The experience at that conference was pretty good proof of that. Behind my back in Silicon Valley, while I was writing about the failures along with the victories, when professional journalists and magazine publishers almost unconditionally worshipped the tech gods, I assume because they respect money more than anything, I wrote about the great victories of tech, but a lot of them didn't come from billionaires and VCs. I don't study the creativity of bankers, I care about tools for creative <i>people.</i> I tried to write the truth, didn't always succeed and sometimes I had to retract. But I did pretty much what journalism preaches. Stayed true to what I believe. The "white men bad" thing was an excuse for people to say I was weak or stupid, or whatever they think. So we get the backlash now. Some of the energy that MAGA gets is honest frustration of people who are victims of DEI, despite the hype from "the woke" which is a term I despise, what's wrong with being awake, what's the alternative, being asleep? dead? -- these righteous assholes, on both sides of this thing, really do treat people as objects, and that hurts, and that kind of pain is hard to forget.

## Report on Paragon Spyware

date: 2025-03-25, updated: 2025-03-24, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Citizen Lab has a <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2025/03/a-first-look-at-paragons-proliferating-spyware-operations/">new report</a> on Paragon&#8217;s spyware:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Introducing Paragon Solutions.</strong> Paragon Solutions was founded in Israel in 2019 and sells spyware called Graphite. The company differentiates itself by claiming it has safeguards to prevent the kinds of spyware abuses that NSO Group and other vendors are notorious for.
<li><strong>Infrastructure Analysis of Paragon Spyware.</strong> Based on a tip from a collaborator, we mapped out server infrastructure that we attribute to Paragon&#8217;s Graphite spyware tool. We identified a subset of suspected Paragon deployments, including in Australia, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Israel, and Singapore.

I live in a place now with a score of zero, you can't do anything without a car. I moved from a place with a <a href="https://www.walkscore.com/score/301-w-57th-st-new-york-ny-10019">score</a> of 99. I'd like to have social networks get a score like that, for how much they feed energy into the open web, vs how much they take out. Something that attracts you from the open web, uses it to build its network, but doesn't reciprocate, gets a low score. Like Twitter or Facebook, they'd have a lot of nerve saying they were of the web, and thankfully they don't. But Bluesky? They would like you to believe they are of the web, that they are feeding the web, when they are not. They would get Twitter's score, divided by two for the dishonesty. Substack? They don't make the claim so they're bad for the web but not the worst. Mastodon? They're trying. But they could make a concerted effort to check the boxes on <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a>, and implement support across their entire network. Give writers a chance to really work on the platform. Give Bluesky some competition which they desperately need (by my estimation, probably not theirs).

A thought for everyone struggling to see a good future in all the michegas. My advice -- please -- do your protesting, resisting, DEIing, organizing, learning, and look for silver linings (they are there) and most important keep doing things that feed your soul. Treat yourself with love even if the world isn't. So in that spirit for those of us who love cats -- a <a href="https://prisonjournalismproject.org/2024/10/23/cats-came-to-my-california-prison/">story</a>.

I would devise a macro that turned random text I wrote online into a properly formatted blog post. for example when i write fast i almost never stop to capitalize things that should be capitalized. or i might abbreviate the name of a product so i expect it to fill it in, as a professional copy editor would. I hope we're heading there. And if they have this, put it behind a simple api so i can wire it into my favorite writing tool. We could even work on a set of standards, a higher level Markdown if you will, that goes deeper than formatting. That would be something for an experienced copy editor to do imho.

We're getting into WordPress in a new way, the need for a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/64">featured image</a> came from users. I didn't know they had this feature in WordPress. If you asked me if it did, I would have said yes, I'm sure it does, but where and what is it called? i could've gotten that too via chatgpt, but i would have had to think of it. that's where having sharp users makes a world of difference. When people thank me for my generosity, they don't get it. I want something out of it, your experience and your mind. It's one of my main raw materials.

With all the good stuff happening with <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a> I haven't found time to wind down feedland.com and feedland.org. The servers are still working, though not performing as I'd like them to, but it doesn't seem I'm going to get the time to do a graceful transition before my self-imposed March 31 deadline. So I'll come up with a new plan, and if you're using either of these services, enjoy! and keep <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/forewarned-is-forearmed">backing up</a> your subscription list.

## More Countries are Demanding Backdoors to Encrypted Apps

<p>Last month, I <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/02/uk-is-ordering-apple-to-break-its-own-encryption.html">wrote about</a> the UK forcing Apple to break its Advanced Data Protection encryption in iCloud. More recently, both <a href="https://therecord.media/sweden-seeks-backdoor-access-to-messaging-apps">Sweden</a> and <a href="https://www.laquadrature.net/en/warondrugslaw/">France</a> are contemplating mandating backdoors. Both initiatives are attempting to <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/12/scaring_people_.html">scare people</a> into supporting backdoors, which are&#8212;of course&#8212;are <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/07/back_doors_wont.html">terrible idea</a>.</p>

## When profit trumps principles

date: 2025-03-23, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

Enshittification as a matter of taste by Dave Rupert To me, enshittification means that a person who lacks taste was put in a position of power. Scale above all else is the philosophy that both buries us in endless genAI slop and locks customers in to enshittified platforms&#8230; and taste is in tension with scale. [&#8230;]
