date: 2025-03-24, updated: 2025-03-21, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Last month I <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/02/uk-is-ordering-apple-to-break-its-own-encryption.html">wrote about</a> the UK forcing Apple to break its Advanced Data Protection encryption in iCloud. More recently, both <a href="https://therecord.media/sweden-seeks-backdoor-access-to-messaging-apps">Sweden</a> and <a href="https://www.laquadrature.net/en/warondrugslaw/">France</a> are contemplating mandating back doors. Both initiatives are attempting to <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/12/scaring_people_.html">scare people</a> into supporting back doors, which are&#8212;of course&#8212;are <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/07/back_doors_wont.html">terrible idea</a>.</p>

## Slow craft: writing with a noncapitalist mentality (Part 6)

date: 2025-03-24, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

This is part six of a series on tackling wants, managing my media diet, and finding enough. Each post stands alone, so you don&#8217;t have to read them all. Read the introduction on &#8220;the mindset of more.&#8221; Last summer, after taking months off from fiction writing to recover from surgery, I blogged about not treating [&#8230;]

## Real Agency

date: 2025-03-23, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

I nominate agency as Word of the Year for 2025. I don&#8217;t nominate agentic, which is suddenly hot shit: See, agency is a noun, and agentic is an adjective. And, as Strunk and White taught us, Write with nouns and verbs, not with adjectives and adverbs&#8230; it is nouns and verbs, not their assistants, that [&#8230;]

Perhaps in response to the growing outcry over last weekend&#8217;s rendition of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador under a legal justification a federal judge has found questionable, President Donald Trump last night told reporters that he didn&#8217;t sign the proclamation that set that legal process in motion.

## When profit trumps principles

date: 2025-03-23, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

Enshittification as a matter of taste by Dave Rupert To me, enshittification means that a person who lacks taste was put in a position of power. Scale above all else is the philosophy that both buries us in endless genAI slop and locks customers in to enshittified platforms&#8230; and taste is in tension with scale. [&#8230;]
