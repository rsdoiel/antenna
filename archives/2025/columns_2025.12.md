<p>Tulpen-Magnolie<br>
Magnolia soulangeana</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-03-21-blumen-20.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I thought chaenomeles was always red, but I guess not.
Here it is again.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-03-21-blumen-22.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The contrast between those trees and the road construction works is poignant.</p>

<p>Israel is continuing its genocide against the Palestinians.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesca_Albanese">Fanscesca Albanese</a> is saying all the right things but people keep arming and Israel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo; to believe that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territories said on Tuesday. &ndash; <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/03/1147976">Rights expert finds ‚Äòreasonable grounds‚Äô genocide is being committed in Gaza</a></p>

<p>Russia is continuing its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War">invasion of Ukraine</a>.
I&rsquo;m following <a href="https://meduza.io/en">Meduza</a> for news from Russia.
I don&rsquo;t know what to do. But seizing Russian assets and supporting Ukraine should be at the obvious thing to do.
Remember the news in 2014:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Twenty years ago, Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons in exchange for security guarantees from Russia and the West. Today Kyiv feels betrayed - and not merely by Moscow. &ndash; <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/ukraines-forgotten-security-guarantee-the-budapest-memorandum/a-18111097">Ukraine&rsquo;s forgotten security guarantee</a>, by Roman Goncharenko / bw, for DW</p>

With Putin&rsquo;s signature.</p>

<p>In a world where there are no consequences, sociopaths keep going on a rampage.</p>

<p>The US federal government keeps collapsing. Soon, the federal state will be dismantled. I wonder if there will be a new (smaller?) union to rise from the ashes.</p>

<blockquote>

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2023/02/28/presidentCarter.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">This may seem controversial, but the Repubs do have a point re <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity,_equity,_and_inclusion">DEI</a>. We really do have a problem honoring the achievements of white men. I know because I get the bullshit when people have tried to honor me for my achievements. When I was offered a keynote spot a the <a href="https://isoj.org/symposia/2019/">ISOJ conference in 2019</a>, to honor my (then) 25 years of blogging, I told the show runner, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosental_Alves">Rosental Alves</a>,  that his audience wouldn't like me. He is gentle generous person, so I believe he was genuinely puzzled. I decided to go, because a future of journalism conference that thinks the advent of blogs was something for journalists and journalism students to acknowledge was something I wanted to see. But in the Q&A period, it all came out. Bluntly and rudely. My contributions mean nothing because I am a white man and in their minds I couldn't have failed. Do they really believe that? Swimming upstream isn't easy for anyone. The experience at that conference was pretty good proof of that. Behind my back in Silicon Valley, while I was writing about the failures along with the victories, when professional journalists and magazine publishers almost unconditionally worshipped the tech gods, I assume because they respect money more than anything, I wrote about the great victories of tech, but a lot of them didn't come from billionaires and VCs. I don't study the creativity of bankers, I care about tools for creative <i>people.</i> I tried to write the truth, didn't always succeed and sometimes I had to retract. But I did pretty much what journalism preaches. Stayed true to what I believe. The "white men bad" thing was an excuse for people to say I was weak or stupid, or whatever they think. So we get the backlash now. Some of the energy that MAGA gets is honest frustration of people who are victims of DEI, despite the hype from "the woke" which is a term I despise, what's wrong with being awake, what's the alternative, being asleep? dead? -- these righteous assholes, on both sides of this thing, really do treat people as objects, and that hurts, and that kind of pain is hard to forget.

## Report on Paragon Spyware

date: 2025-03-25, updated: 2025-03-24, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Citizen Lab has a <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2025/03/a-first-look-at-paragons-proliferating-spyware-operations/">new report</a> on Paragon&#8217;s spyware:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Introducing Paragon Solutions.</strong> Paragon Solutions was founded in Israel in 2019 and sells spyware called Graphite. The company differentiates itself by claiming it has safeguards to prevent the kinds of spyware abuses that NSO Group and other vendors are notorious for.
<li><strong>Infrastructure Analysis of Paragon Spyware.</strong> Based on a tip from a collaborator, we mapped out server infrastructure that we attribute to Paragon&#8217;s Graphite spyware tool. We identified a subset of suspected Paragon deployments, including in Australia, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Israel, and Singapore.

I live in a place now with a score of zero, you can't do anything without a car. I moved from a place with a <a href="https://www.walkscore.com/score/301-w-57th-st-new-york-ny-10019">score</a> of 99. I'd like to have social networks get a score like that, for how much they feed energy into the open web, vs how much they take out. Something that attracts you from the open web, uses it to build its network, but doesn't reciprocate, gets a low score. Like Twitter or Facebook, they'd have a lot of nerve saying they were of the web, and thankfully they don't. But Bluesky? They would like you to believe they are of the web, that they are feeding the web, when they are not. They would get Twitter's score, divided by two for the dishonesty. Substack? They don't make the claim so they're bad for the web but not the worst. Mastodon? They're trying. But they could make a concerted effort to check the boxes on <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a>, and implement support across their entire network. Give writers a chance to really work on the platform. Give Bluesky some competition which they desperately need (by my estimation, probably not theirs).

A thought for everyone struggling to see a good future in all the michegas. My advice -- please -- do your protesting, resisting, DEIing, organizing, learning, and look for silver linings (they are there) and most important keep doing things that feed your soul. Treat yourself with love even if the world isn't. So in that spirit for those of us who love cats -- a <a href="https://prisonjournalismproject.org/2024/10/23/cats-came-to-my-california-prison/">story</a>.

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/03/24/rulingClass.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">The ruling class in America is more out in the open now. Pretty much the same people who brought us the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_Lehman_Brothers">Lehman Brothers</a> too-big-to-fail meltdown in 2008 and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Brothers_riot">Brooks Brothers Riot</a> in Y2K. Not sure if <i>oligarch</i> is the right word. Peter O'Toole starred in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ruling_Class_(film)">The Ruling Class</a>, a favorite when I was younger. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w936v-gomtc">last song</a> in the movie is pretty freaking great.

I want natural language text macros in ChatGPT. I would devise a macro that turned random text I wrote online into a properly formatted blog post. for example when i write fast i almost never stop to capitalize things that should be capitalized. or i might abbreviate the name of a product so i expect it to fill it in, as a professional copy editor would. I hope we're heading there. And if they have this, put it behind a simple api so i can wire it into my favorite writing tool. We could even work on a set of standards, a higher level Markdown if you will, that goes deeper than formatting. That would be something for an experienced copy editor to do imho.

We're getting into WordPress in a new way, the need for a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/64">featured image</a> came from users. I didn't know they had this feature in WordPress. If you asked me if it did, I would have said yes, I'm sure it does, but where and what is it called? i could've gotten that too via chatgpt, but i would have had to think of it. that's where having sharp users makes a world of difference. When people thank me for my generosity, they don't get it. I want something out of it, your experience and your mind. It's one of my main raw materials.

With all the good stuff happening with <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a> I haven't found time to wind down feedland.com and feedland.org. The servers are still working, though not performing as I'd like them to, but it doesn't seem I'm going to get the time to do a graceful transition before my self-imposed March 31 deadline. So I'll come up with a new plan, and if you're using either of these services, enjoy! and keep <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/forewarned-is-forearmed">backing up</a> your subscription list.

## More Countries are Demanding Backdoors to Encrypted Apps

<p>Last month, I <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/02/uk-is-ordering-apple-to-break-its-own-encryption.html">wrote about</a> the UK forcing Apple to break its Advanced Data Protection encryption in iCloud.

Perhaps in response to the growing outcry over last weekend&#8217;s rendition of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador under a legal justification a federal judge has found questionable, President Donald Trump last night told reporters that he didn&#8217;t sign the proclamation that set that legal process in motion.

## When profit trumps principles

date: 2025-03-23, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

Enshittification as a matter of taste by Dave Rupert To me, enshittification means that a person who lacks taste was put in a position of power. Scale above all else is the philosophy that both buries us in endless genAI slop and locks customers in to enshittified platforms&#8230; and taste is in tension with scale. [&#8230;]
