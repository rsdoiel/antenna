## Buying a $250 Residency Card From a Tropical Island Let Me Bypass U.S. Crypto Laws

date: 2025-03-03, from: 404 Media Group

U.S. traders are buying 'digital residency' in Palau to skirt restrictions on the amount of cryptocurrency they can withdraw and the exchanges they can use. Major exchanges have already banned the ID, fearing abuse.

## Notes from my Accessibility and Gen AI podcast appearence

date: 2025-03-02, updated: 2025-03-02, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p>I was a guest on <a href="https://accessibility-and-gen-ai.simplecast.com/episodes/ep-6-simon-willison-datasette">the most recent episode</a> of the <a href="https://linktr.ee/a11ygenai">Accessibility + Gen AI Podcast</a>, hosted by Eamon McErlean and Joe Devon. We had a really fun, wide-ranging conversation about a host of different topics. I've extracted a few choice quotes from the transcript.</p>

<p><lite-youtube videoid="zoxpEM6TLEU" js-api="js-api"
  title="Ep 6 - Simon Willison - Creator, Datasette"
  playlabel="Play: Ep 6 - Simon Willison - Creator, Datasette"
> </lite-youtube></p>

<h4 id="alt-text">LLMs for drafting alt text</h4>

<p>I use LLMs for the first draft of my alt text (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoxpEM6TLEU&amp;t=22m10s">22:10</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I actually use Large Language Models for most of my alt text these days. Whenever I tweet an image or whatever, I've got a Claude project called Alt text writer. It's got a prompt and an example. I dump an image in and it gives me the alt text.</p>
<p>I very rarely just use it because that's rude, right? You should never dump text onto people that you haven't reviewed yourself. But it's always a good starting point.</p>
<p>Normally I'll edit a tiny little bit. I'll delete an unimportant detail or I'll bulk something up. And then I've got alt text that works.</p>
<p>Often it's actually got really good taste. A great example is if you've got a screenshot of an interface, there's a lot of words in that screenshot and most of them don't matter.</p>
<p>The message you're trying to give in the alt text is that it's two panels on the left, there's a conversation on the right, there's a preview of the SVG file or something. My alt text writer normally gets that right.</p>
<p>It's even good at summarizing tables of data where it will notice that actually what really matters is that Gemini got a score of 57 and Nova got a score of 53 - so it will pull those details out and ignore [irrelevant columns] like the release dates and so forth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's the current custom instructions prompt I'm using for that Claude Project:</p>
<blockquote><p><code>You write alt text for any image pasted in by the user. Alt text is always presented in a fenced code block to make it easy to copy and paste out. It is always presented on a single line so it can be used easily in Markdown images. All text on the image (for screenshots etc) must be exactly included. A short note describing the nature of the image itself should go first.</code></p></blockquote>

<h4 id="ethics">Is it ethical to build unreliable accessibility tools?</h4>

<p>On the ethics of building accessibility tools on top of inherently unreliable technology (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoxpEM6TLEU&amp;t=5m35s">5:33</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people I've talked to have been skeptical about the accessibility benefits because their argument is that if you give somebody unreliable technology that might hallucinate and make things up, surely that's harming them.</p>
<p>I don't think that's true. I feel like people who use screen readers are used to unreliable technology.</p>
<p>You know, if you use a guide dog - it's a wonderful thing and a <em>very</em> unreliable piece of technology.</p>
<p>When you consider that people with accessibility needs have agency, they can understand the limitations of the technology they're using. I feel like giving them a tool where they can point their phone at something and it can describe it to them is a world away from accessibility technology just three or four years ago.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="not-a-threat">Why I don't feel threatened as a software engineer</h4>
<p>This is probably my most coherent explanation yet of why I don't see generative AI as a threat to my career as a software engineer (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoxpEM6TLEU&amp;t=33m51s">33:49</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My perspective on this as a developer who's been using these systems on a daily basis for a couple of years now is that I find that they enhance my value. I am so much more competent and capable as a developer because I've got these tools assisting me. I can write code in dozens of new programming languages that I never learned before.</p>
<p>But I still get to benefit from my 20 years of experience.</p>
<p>Take somebody off the street who's never written any code before and ask them to build an iPhone app with ChatGPT. They are going to run into so many pitfalls, because programming isn't just about can you write code - it's about thinking through the problems, understanding what's possible and what's not, understanding how to QA, what good code is, having good taste.</p>
<p>There's so much depth to what we do as software engineers.</p>
<p>I've said before that generative AI probably gives me like two to five times productivity boost on the part of my job that involves typing code into a laptop. But that's only 10 percent of what I do. As a software engineer, most of my time isn't actually spent with the typing of the code. It's all of those other activities.</p>
<p>The AI systems help with those other activities, too. They can help me think through architectural decisions and research library options and so on. But I still have to have that agency to understand what I'm doing.</p>
<p>So as a software engineer, I don't feel threatened. My most optimistic view of this is that the cost of developing software goes down because an engineer like myself can be more ambitious, can take on more things. As a result, demand for software goes up - because if you're a company that previously would never have dreamed of building a custom CRM for your industry because it would have taken 20 engineers a year before you got any results... If it now takes four engineers three months to get results, maybe you're in the market for software engineers now that you weren't before.</p>

## 18f.org

date: 2025-03-02, updated: 2025-03-02, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://18f.org/">18f.org</a></strong></p>
New site by members of 18F, the team within the US government that were doing some of the most effective work at improving government efficiency.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For over 11 years, 18F has been proudly serving you to make government technology work better. We are non-partisan civil servants. 18F has worked on hundreds of projects, all designed to make government technology not just efficient but effective, and to save money for American taxpayers.</p>
<p>However, all employees at 18F ‚Äì a group that the Trump Administration GSA Technology Transformation Services Director called "the gold standard" of civic tech ‚Äì were terminated today at midnight ET.</p>
<p><strong>18F was doing exactly the type of work that DOGE claims to want ‚Äì yet we were eliminated.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The entire team is now on "administrative leave" and locked out of their computers.</p>
<p>But these are not the kind of civil servants to abandon their mission without a fight:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We‚Äôre not done yet.</strong></p>
<p>We‚Äôre still absorbing what has happened. We‚Äôre wrestling with what it will mean for ourselves and our families, as well as the impact on our partners and the American people.</p>
<p>But we came to the government to fix things. And we‚Äôre not done with this work yet.</p>
<p>More to come.</p>

## Hallucinations in code are the least dangerous form of LLM mistakes

date: 2025-03-02, updated: 2025-03-02, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p>A surprisingly common complaint I see from developers who have tried using LLMs for code is that they encountered a hallucination - usually the LLM inventing a method or even a full software library that doesn't exist - and it crashed their confidence in LLMs as a tool for writing code. How could anyone productively use these things if they invent methods that don't exist?</p>
<p>Hallucinations in code <strong>are the least harmful hallucinations you can encounter from a model</strong>.</p>
<p>The real risk from using LLMs for code is that they'll make mistakes that <em>aren't</em> instantly caught by the language compiler or interpreter. And these happen <em>all the time</em>!</p>

<p>The moment you run LLM generated code, any hallucinated methods will be instantly obvious: you'll get an error. You can fix that yourself or you can feed the error back into the LLM and watch it correct itself.</p>
<p>Compare this to hallucinations in regular prose, where you need a critical eye, strong intuitions and well developed fact checking skills to avoid sharing information that's incorrect and directly harmful to your reputation.</p>
<p>With code you get a powerful form of fact checking for free. Run the code, see if it works.</p>
<p>In some setups - <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/code-interpreter/">ChatGPT Code Interpreter</a>, <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview">Claude Code</a>, any of the growing number of "agentic" code systems that write and then execute code in a loop - the LLM system itself will spot the error and automatically correct itself.</p>
<p>If you're using an LLM to write code without even running it yourself, <em>what are you doing?</em></p>
<p>Hallucinated methods are such a tiny roadblock that when people complain about them I assume they've spent minimal time learning how to effectively use these systems - they dropped them at the first hurdle.</p>
<p>My cynical side suspects they may have been looking for a reason to dismiss the technology and jumped at the first one they found.</p>
<p>My less cynical side assumes that nobody ever warned them that you have to put a lot of work in to learn how to get good results out of these systems. I've been exploring <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming/">their applications for writing code</a> for over two years now and I'm still learning new tricks (and new strengths and weaknesses) almost every day.</p>

<h4 id="qa">Manually testing code is essential</h4>

<p>Just because code looks good and runs without errors doesn't mean it's actually doing the right thing. No amount of meticulous code review - or even comprehensive automated tests - will demonstrably prove that code actually does the right thing. You have to run it yourself!</p>
<p>Proving to yourself that the code works is your job. This is one of the many reasons I don't think LLMs are going to put software professionals out of work.</p>
<p>LLM code will usually look fantastic: good variable names, convincing comments, clear type annotations and a logical structure. This can lull you into a false sense of security, in the same way that a gramatically correct and confident answer from ChatGPT might tempt you to skip fact checking or applying a skeptical eye.</p>
<p>The way to avoid <em>those</em> problems is the same as how you avoid problems in code by other humans that you are reviewing, or code that you've written yourself: you need to actively exercise that code. You need to have great manual QA skills.</p>
<p>A general rule for programming is that you should <em>never</em> trust any piece of code until you've seen it work with your own eye - or, even better, seen it fail and then fixed it.</p>
<p>Across my entire career, almost every time I've assumed some code works without actively executing it - some branch condition that rarely gets hit, or an error message that I don't expect to occur - I've later come to regret that assumption.</p>

<h4 id="tips">Tips for reducing hallucinations</h4>
<p>If you really are seeing a deluge of hallucinated details in the code LLMs are producing for you, there are a bunch of things you can do about it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Try different models. It might be that another model has better training data for your chosen platform. As a Python and JavaScript programmer my favorite models right now are Claude 3.7 Sonnet with thinking turned on, OpenAI's o3-mini-high and GPT-4o with Code Interpreter (for Python).</li>
<li>Learn how to use the context. If an LLM doesn't know a particular library you can often fix this by dumping in a few dozen lines of example code. LLMs are incredibly good at imitating things, and at rapidly picking up patterns from very limited examples. Modern model's have increasingly large context windows - I've recently started using Claude's new <a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/10167454-using-the-github-integration">GitHub integration</a> to dump entire repositories into the context and it's been working extremely well for me.</li>
<li>Chose <a href="https://boringtechnology.club/">boring technology</a>. I genuinely find myself picking libraries that have been around for a while partly because that way it's much more likely that LLMs will be able to use them.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll finish this rant with a related observation: I keep seeing people say "if I have to review every line of code an LLM writes, it would have been faster to write it myself!"</p>
<p>Those people are loudly declaring that they have under-invested in the crucial skills of reading, understanding and reviewing code written by other people. I suggest getting some more practice in. Reviewing code written for you by LLMs is a great way to do that.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Bonus section</em>: I asked Claude 3.7 Sonnet "extended thinking mode" to review an earlier draft of this post - "<code>Review my rant of a blog entry. I want to know if the argument is convincing, small changes I can make to improve it, if there are things I've missed.</code>". It was quite helpful, especially in providing tips to make that first draft a little less confrontational! Since you can share Claude chats now <a href="https://claude.ai/share/685cd6d9-f18a-47ef-ae42-e9815df821f1">here's that transcript</a>.</p>
