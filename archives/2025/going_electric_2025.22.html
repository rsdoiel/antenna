In your daily reminder that China is living in the year 3000 while most
Americans still think EVs and hybrids are new technology
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_EV1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly
thirty years after the launch of GM’s EV1</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_hybrid_vehicles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the
original Toyota Prius</a>, leading global plugin car brand BYD has
announced fresh plans to deploy 15,000 megawatt charging stations across
the nation.

<p>
The electric motorcycle market is a small and highly interconnected one,
with a limited amount of suppliers and an even smaller number of actual
honest-to-goodness motorcycle manufacturers. While Covid-era progress
led to a series of highly-funded
<a href="https://electrek.co/2022/07/20/ryvid-anthem-electric-motorcycle-unveil/">rapid
advancements</a> and
<a href="https://electrek.co/2020/11/18/damon-unveils-two-new-electric-motorcycles-based-on-novel-hyperdrive-platform/">flashy
announcements</a>, the last few years have been hard on the industry as
funding and excitement have both dwindled, resulting in a smaller number
of big releases. So it makes sense that people would jump at news that
Honda is now producing its first electric motorcycle and that you can
already buy it. The only problem is that none of that is true – finally
some <em>real</em> fake news.

The French are saying “non, merci” to Tesla, as sales crashed to just
700 units in May – a level not seen in more than three years.

<p>
The Model Y changeover was clearly not the problem.

Tesla still has no plan to make things right for millions of car owners
with its ‘HW3’ system, more than four months after it finally admitted
that the hardware won’t support self-driving.
</p>
<p>
At this point, the automaker is just hoping they buy new cars.
