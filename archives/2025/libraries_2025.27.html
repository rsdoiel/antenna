<h2 id="data-science-crossref">Data Science <span class="citation"
data-cites="Crossref">@Crossref</span></h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
To address the growing scale and complexity of scholarly data, we’ve
launched a new data science function at Crossref. In April, we were
excited to welcome our first data scientists,
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/people/jason-portenoy/">Jason
Portenoy</a> and
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/people/alex-b%C3%A9dard-vall%C3%A9e/">Alex
Bédard-Vallée</a>, to the team. With their arrival, the Data Science
team is now fully up and running. In this blog post, we’re sharing our
vision and what’s ahead for data science at Crossref.
</p>
<h2 id="new-approach-to-achieve-our-mission">
New approach to achieve our mission
</h2>
<p>
Over the last few years, we have witnessed substantial growth of the
scholarly community in general, and Crossref in particular. This has
been reflected in the increase in the volume and variety of the data we
collect, store and process, including scholarly metadata and Crossref
operational data related to membership, DOI registrations, billing,
usage measurement, and other activities.
</p>
<p>
On the one hand, this growth opens new possibilities for using the data
to better understand the scholarly landscape, serve our community,
develop services, and make informed decisions. On the other hand, it
forces us to address a set of challenges related to the scale and
complexity of the data.
</p>
<p>
The new Data Science team, created as part of
<a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/bm6g0-gvy36" target="_blank">last
year’s broader organisational changes</a>, will address these challenges
and fulfil our data-related ambitions. As part of our
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/strategy/">strategic mission</a>, we
created the following vision for the Data Science team within Crossref
and our community:
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Data Science team uses scientific research and data science
to deliver, assess, improve, and enrich scholarly metadata.</strong>
</p>
<p>
The work of the Data Science team broadly entails two types of projects:
1) data analysis &amp; insights; and 2) data services &amp; workflows.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Data analysis &amp; insights</strong>: The goal of these kinds
of projects is to broaden our understanding of the scholarly record and
our community and help Crossref make decisions in a data-driven way,
without trying to create any specific application or product. They will
help Crossref explore new strategic directions, make more informed
decisions, monitor the trends and outcomes of certain decisions and
policies, and discover and share new insights with the community. This
category also involves large and small data assessments and analyses,
measuring and monitoring certain metrics, verifying hypotheses,
answering questions using data, monitoring trends in the metadata,
forecasting, data visualisation, reporting, and interpreting results.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Data services &amp; workflows</strong>: The goal of these kinds
of projects is to apply scientific knowledge and data analysis to build
and maintain Crossref services, tools, and workflows. The Data Science
team collaborates with other Crossref teams on the research, design and
implementation of the Crossref system and its various components. This
will involve modelling across different data stores and APIs, as well as
designing efficient and robust data workflows for various processes,
including metadata deposit, validation, and dissemination. Furthermore,
the team will investigate and implement modern tools and techniques for
efficient data processing, storage and analysis, and strategies for data
enrichment. Finally, the Data Science team is involved in planning and
implementing comprehensive monitoring and reporting for various features
and services.
</p>
<h2 id="connecting-with-the-community">
Connecting with the community
</h2>
<p>
Crossref exists as part of a diverse, global community of 22,000 members
from 160 countries, plus countless systems that rely on our metadata.
Launching the new Data Science function gives us a great opportunity to
connect more deeply and in new ways with the wider scholarly community.
We’re keen to engage with Crossref members, users of our services, and
partner organisations to better understand trends and needs, and to
contribute to others’ community initiatives and awareness.
</p>
<p>
One area we’re particularly interested in is the growing range of
initiatives in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metascience" target="_blank">metascience</a>
space. We’re looking to expand and solidify our understanding of how
researchers use our data and services, and to learn more about their
needs and perspectives. These insights will help inform the design and
functionality of our data workflows and APIs over the long term.
</p>
<p>
We’re also committed to supporting the scholarly community’s efforts to
preserve the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/research-integrity/">integrity
of the scholarly record (ISR)</a>. By applying modern, scalable data
processing techniques, we aim to help detect and investigate potential
issues affecting metadata quality, including both intentional
manipulation and unintentional errors or inconsistencies.
</p>
<p>
More broadly, we’re looking forward to engaging with our community on
scalable data processing approaches, as well as best practices and
standards for processing and enriching scholarly metadata.
</p>
<h2 id="introducing-new-members-of-the-team">
Introducing new members of the team
</h2>
<p>
We couldn’t pursue our ambitious goals without the dedication and
passion of our team. In April, we were thrilled to welcome two data
scientists, Jason Portenoy and Alex Bédard-Vallée, to the Crossref team.
</p>
<p>
Alex Bédard-Vallée brings over six years of experience extracting
meaningful insights from data within the research and scholarly
publishing sector, applying it to large-scale bibliometric data, aiming
to better serve the scholarly community. Prior to Crossref, during his
tenure at Elsevier, he was instrumental in modernising data
infrastructure, significantly enhancing the efficiency of massive
research data pipelines. His contributions included developing automated
data quality checks, creating reusable Python tools to streamline data
access, and leveraging machine learning techniques to uncover research
trends. Alex provided key insights for major reports, contributing to
evaluations for the Canada Research Chairs Program and the NSF Science
and Engineering Indicators between 2020 and 2024. Alex holds an M.Sc. in
Quantum Physics (2018) and a B.Sc. in Physics (2016) from the Université
de Sherbrooke.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.jasport.org/" target="_blank">Jason Portenoy</a> is
a New York-based data scientist with a background in bibliometric
research and building applications using scholarly data. Through his
work, he has become a passionate advocate for the maintenance and
improvement of high-quality scholarly metadata. He holds a PhD in
Information Science from the University of Washington where he studied
how scholarly metadata can offer insights into scientific activity and
help develop tools to address information overload. He brings experience
working at OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar, and other organisations concerned
with scholarly communication. Most recently, he was the Senior Data
Engineer at OpenAlex, and he is now excited to continue his work using
data science to support and strengthen crucial open scholarly
infrastructure.
</p>
<h2 id="whats-next-for-us">
What’s next for us?
</h2>
<p>
In the short term, we are focusing on two main projects: analysing how
reliably DOIs resolve, and detecting discrepancies in bibliographic
references at scale.
</p>
<p>
<strong>DOI resolutions</strong>: DOIs are persistent identifiers and
links that are meant to consistently resolve to landing pages that
represent the object they identify and Crossref has certain obligations
that members have to adhere to, one of which is that if the location of
the landing page changes, it is the responsibility of the member to
update the metadata so the DOI continues to resolve correctly.
<a href="https://doi.org/10.64000/hv6t0-0h481" target="_blank">Some
prior work</a> has suggested this doesn’t always happen, so there are
some gaps in the scholarly record. We’re now analysing metadata from a
broad sample of members to better understand the scale of the issue, and
to identify cases where members may need to update their metadata
records.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Detecting discrepancies in bibliographic references</strong>:
Following
<a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2501.03771" target="_blank">last
year’s reports</a> of discrepancies between bibliographic references in
metadata records and those found in full-text PDFs, we’ve explored ways
to run broader, systematic checks across a larger set of members and
metadata records. The goal was to understand how widespread these
inconsistencies are and to identify cases where members may need support
in correcting references in their metadata records. Ultimately, we aim
to create a collaborative process that improves the accuracy and
reliability of bibliographic references across the scholarly record,
enhancing research discovery and reproducibility and ensuring impact
assessments are reliable.
</p>
<p>
Look out for forthcoming blog posts with more details on these projects!
</p>
<p>
Looking further ahead, Crossref has two big projects for which the Data
Science team will serve central roles: developing dashboards, and
improving metadata matching.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Data dashboards</strong>: We are planning to develop a series of
dashboards to monitor the state of the scholarly record over time. These
will include both work-level statistics (e.g., how many works of a given
type have been registered?) and more detailed insights at the
relationship level (e.g., how many bibliographic references have been
automatically matched? How often are ROR IDs included in funder
assertions?). Upstream, this will require us to build an environment
where all relevant data sources can be combined, as well as adopting a
suite of scalable tools and data processing techniques.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Metadata matching</strong>: In April, we commenced the matching
project. It is a major effort to rebuild Crossref’s metadata matching
workflows using modern software development and data science practices.
The goal is to create a dedicated consolidated matching workflow that
will eventually replace all existing production matching processes, with
results made available through the REST API. This project covers six
matching tasks: bibliographic reference matching, funder name matching,
preprint matching, affiliation matching, grant matching, and title
matching.
</p>
<p>
(In the meantime, as we do not have a good mechanism to add matching
results to the REST API yet, we separately released two datasets with
relationships discovered by automated matching strategies:
<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15124417" target="_blank">a
dataset of relationships between preprints and journal articles</a>, and
<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15254993" target="_blank">a
dataset of relationships involving research organisations</a>.)
</p>
<p>
As you can tell, we are very excited about Crossref’s role in the
modern, open, community-focused future of scholarly infrastructure. The
new Data Science team is a crucial component of this vision. If you’re
interested in collaborating or learning more about data science at
Crossref, we’d love to hear from you!
