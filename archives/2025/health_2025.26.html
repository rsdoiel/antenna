cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression in Chinese yellow quail</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionImmunosuppression in poultry production, particularly in
high-value species like the Chinese yellow quail (Coturnix japonica),
increases disease susceptibility and economic losses. Plant-derived
polysaccharides, such as those from Terminalia chebula Retz (TC) and
Rubia cordifolia L. processed Terminalia chebula Retz polysaccharide
(RTCP), offer promising alternatives due to their ability to enhance
host defense mechanisms without adverse effects. This study investigates
RTCP’s efficacy in mitigating cyclophosphamide (CTX)-induced
immunosuppression in quails, focusing on immune function
restoration.MethodsOne hundred and twenty 21-day-old healthy quails were
randomly divided into six groups (n=20/group): a blank control (saline),
a model group (saline + CTX), and four RTCP-treated groups (0.25, 0.5,
0.75, 1 g/kg + CTX). CTX (80 mg/kg) was administered intramuscularly
(days 4–7) to induce immunosuppression, except in the blank control.
Spleen indices, histology, cytokine profiles, antibody titers,
GATA-3/T-bet mRNA expression, and transcriptional networks were
analyzed.ResultsCTX significantly reduced spleen weight, organ indices,
cytokine levels, and antibody titers (P&lt;0.05). Compared to the model
group, 0.5 g/kg RTCP restored spleen morphology and function, elevated
cytokines (e.g., IL-2, IFN-γ) and immunoglobulins, and upregulated
complement components (C3, C5) and acute-phase proteins, enhancing
T-cell and B-cell activation (P&lt;0.05). RTCP also rebalanced the
Th1/Th2 axis by normalizing the T-bet/GATA-3 ratio, indicating immune
homeostasis recovery.DiscussionRTCP effectively counteracted CTX-induced
immunosuppression by modulating innate and adaptive immunity, including
complement activation and Th1/Th2 balance. These findings highlight
RTCP’s potential as a natural immunomodulator in poultry. Further
research should optimize dosing and explore gut-microbiota-immune
interactions to enhance therapeutic applications.</p>

of oral and gut microbiomes in enterosalivary nitrate metabolism and
their effects on systemic disease</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Nitrate, which maintains hemostasis in systemic circulation, is
obtained from nitrate-rich vegetables, concentrated, reabsorbed by the
salivary glands, and reduced to nitrite and nitric oxide (NO•). The
bioavailability of nitrate and nitrite depends on unique nitrate
reductases present in specific bacterial communities in the mouth and
gut of mammals. The dominant bacteria in the oral cavity, stomach, and
gut differ among internal environments. Nitrate can modulate microbiota
metabolism and has important pathophysiological functions in diseases
such as cardiovascular diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, diabetes,
metabolic diseases, and brain diseases via nitrate-reducing bacteria.
Thus, in this review, we summarized the beneficial role of
enterosalivary nitrate metabolism, focusing on the role of oral and gut
bacterial communities in the enzymatic reduction of nitrate to nitrite.
We have also discussed different nitrate-reduction pathways; influencing
factors of nitrate-reducing bacteria; and the relationship among
systemic health, nitrate intake, and bacteria. This review of
enterosalivary nitrate and related microbiomes could provide a new
perspective for the application of nitrate.</p>

profiling of colorectal cancer biopsies: a culture-based study in Indian
patients</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Emerging research has highlighted the significant role of
microorganisms in the initiation and progression of colorectal cancer
(CRC). However, further investigation is required to elucidate the
precise mechanisms by which the microbial community or specific bacteria
contribute to carcinogenesis. The present work deals with the isolation
and identification of bacteria from nine CRC biopsy samples and nine
adjacent normal biopsy samples. Different media, such as brain heart
infusion (BHI), anaerobic basal agar (ABA), and trypticase soy agar
(TSA), and culture conditions have been manipulated to maximize the
isolation of bacteria residing in biopsy samples. A total of 75 bacteria
were isolated from the tumor and adjacent site. Enterococcus,
Escherichia, Klebsiella, Shigella, Citrobacter, Morganella, and
Veillonella have been found to be enriched in most of the tumor
biopsies, while biopsies collected from adjacent tissues had
Escherichia, Shigella, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus bacteria. A
culture-based approach to assessing bacterial diversity offer
advantages, enabling the study of individual bacteria to elucidate
mechanisms of intestinal carcinogenesis. This approach may provide novel
insights into pathology and potentially lead to new therapeutic
modalities targeting the specific bacteria implicated in the
inflammation and carcinogenesis of CRC.</p>

between vaginal microecological alterations and high-risk human
papillomavirus infection: a cross-sectional study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the correlation between
alterations in the vaginal microecological environment and high-risk
human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection, thereby providing a theoretical
basis for clinical prevention and early intervention.MethodsA total of
854 patients who visited the gynecology outpatient clinic at Wusong
Central Hospital, Baoshan District, Shanghai, between June and December
2023 were included. Vaginal secretions were collected for HPV genotyping
and microecological analysis. Patients were categorized into
HR-HPV-positive (n=222) and HR-HPV-negative (n=632) groups. The
detection rates of various HR-HPV subtypes (HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39,
45, 51, 52, 53, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 73, 82) were analyzed. Key
microecological indicators—including vaginal pH, hydrogen peroxide,
leukocyte esterase, sialidase, Lactobacillus levels, and vaginal
cleanliness—were compared between the two groups, and their predictive
value for HR-HPV infection was assessed using ROC curve
analysis.ResultsSignificant differences were observed between the two
groups in terms of vaginal pH, hydrogen peroxide, leukocyte esterase,
sialidase activity, Lactobacillus abundance, and vaginal cleanliness
(all P &lt; 0.05). The ROC curve analysis yielded an AUC of 0.701,
indicating moderate predictive value.ConclusionChanges in the vaginal
microecological environment are significantly associated with HR-HPV
infection. Monitoring vaginal microecological indicators may provide
adjunctive information for clinical prevention and early intervention,
though further prospective studies are needed to establish
causality.</p>

infection</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveTo investigate the relationship between TNF-α, IL-6, and
IFN-γ serum levels and the severity of infection and prognosis in
patients with diabetic foot infection (DFI).MethodsA total of 144
patients diagnosed with diabetic foot at our hospital from January 2020
to December 2023 were enrolled in the study. Patients were divided into
an infection group (70 cases) and a non-infection group (74 cases) based
on the presence of infection. The infection group was further
categorized into mild (29 cases), moderate (18 cases), and severe
infection (23 cases) subgroups according to infection severity. Serum
levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IFN-γ in DFI patients were analyzed, and
their predictive value for treatment outcomes was evaluatedResultsSerum
levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IFN-γ were significantly higher in the
infection group than in the non-infection group (P&lt;0.05). Moreover,
there were significant differences in TNF-α, IL-6, and IFN-γ levels
among patients with mild, moderate, and severe infections (P&lt;0.05).
ROC curve analysis demonstrated that the area under the curve (AUC) for
the combined detection of TNF-α, IL-6, and IFN-γ in assessing DFI
severity was 0.855, which was significantly higher than that of TNF-α
(0.811), IL-6 (0.793), and IFN-γ (0.764) (P&lt;0.05). Furthermore, serum
levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IFN-γ were significantly higher in the poor
prognosis group than in the good prognosis group (P&lt;0.05). ROC curve
analysis showed that the AUC for predicting poor prognosis in DFI
patients was 0.926 when TNF-α, IL-6, and IFN-γ were combined, which was
significantly higher than that of TNF-α (0.849), IL-6 (0.834), and IFN-γ
(0.809) (P&lt;0.05).ConclusionSerum levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IFN-γ are
elevated in DFI patients and are closely associated with infection
severity and prognosis. The combined detection of these three
inflammatory factors can serve as a predictive indicator for infection
severity and poor prognosis in DFI patients.</p>

id="mosquito--and-tick-borne-orthoflaviviruses-cross-an-in-vitro-endothelial-astrocyte-barrier">Mosquito-
and tick-borne orthoflaviviruses cross an in vitro endothelial-astrocyte
barrier</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe genus Orthoflavivirus of the Flaviviridae family
includes several notable pathogens such as mosquito-borne West-Nile
virus (Orthoflavivirus nilense, WNV) and Tick-borne encephalitis virus
(Orthoflavivirus encephalitidis, TBEV) that are highly neurotropic and
may cause severe neurological disease leading to lifelong disabilities,
coma and death. These viruses have developed mechanisms to breach the
compact blood-brain barrier (BBB) and establish infection within the
central nervous system (CNS). Nevertheless, neuroinvasive mechanisms of
orthoflaviviruses remain poorly understood. Complex anatomy of the CNS
and the organization of the BBB is a major challenge to study
neuroinvasion of orthoflaviviruses in vivo. Therefore, in vitro BBB
models are useful tools to study direct interaction of viruses with the
endothelial barrier.MethodsIn this study, we employed an in vitro
transwell BBB model comprising primary mouse brain microvascular
endothelial cells and astrocytes to compare the ability of
mosquito-borne and tick-borne orthoflaviviruses to cross a compact
endothelial barrier and reach the basolateral compartment of the
transwell system. The influence of virus inoculation on the barrier
properties was determined by measuring transendothelial electrical
resistance (TEER).ResultsThe results demonstrate that while pathogenic
WNV and TBEV cross the endothelial barrier the ability of low pathogenic
Usutu virus (USUV) and Langat virus (LGTV) was inconsistent. All viruses
tested display virus replication within the endothelial cells.
Nevertheless, virus replication did not affect the barrier function of
endothelial cells as demonstrated by sustained TEER and absence of
leakage of high molecular weight dextran molecules through the
endothelial barrier even at several hours post infection.DiscussionOur
findings indicate that orthoflaviviruses can infect the endothelial
cells, replicate within them without affecting the cells and its barrier
function. Nevertheless, only pathogenic WNV and TBEV showed the ability
to cross the endothelial barrier and reach the basolateral
compartment.</p>

strain defined as a novel species in the Acinetobacter genus

blaNDM-1 from a beef cattle farm in Hebei, China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe co-existence phenomenon of antibiotic resistance
genes (ARGs), particularly of last-resort antibiotics in multi-drug
resistant (MDR) bacteria, is of particular concern in the least studied
bacterial species.MethodsIn 2023, strain M2 was isolated from the sludge
sample at a commercial bovine farm in Hebei province, China, using a
MacConkey plate containing meropenem. PCR amplification and Sanger
sequencing verified it co-carrying blaNDM and tet(X) genes. It was
classified within the Acinetobacter genus by MALDI-TOF-MS and 16S rDNA
analyses. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on the Oxford
Nanopore platform, with species-level identification via ANI and dDDH.
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed against 20
antibiotics. Conjugation assays employed the filter-mating method using
E. coli J53 and Salmonella LGJ2 as recipients.ResultsThis strain was
confirmed as a novel species of Acinetobacter genus, showing resistance
to meropenem, ampicillin, ceftazidime, cefepime, gentamicin, kanamycin,
fosfomycin, imipenem, ertapenem, and tetracycline. Despite carrying
tet(X3), it remained susceptible to tigecycline, omadacycline, and
doxycycline. The genome carried 11 ARG types, multiple metal resistance
genes (MRGs), and virulence factor (VF) genes. The blaNDM-1 was located
in a skeleton, ISAba125-blaNDM-1-bleMBL-trpF, which was carried by an
ISAba14-mediated rolling-circle-like structure in pM2-2-NDM-1
(rep_cluster_481). Integrative and conjugative element (ICE) and
multiple pdif modules (driven by the XerCD site-specific recombination
(XerCD SSR) system), which were associated with the mobilization of
resistance determinants, were identified in this plasmid. Chromosomal
tet(X3) was mediated by ISVsa3, forming a skeleton, ISVsa3-XerD-tet
(X3)-res-ISVsa3.DiscussionThe co-occurrence of blaNDM and tet(X) in a
novel species of the Acinetobacter genus hints that substantial
undiscovered bacteria co-carrying high-risk ARGs are concealing in the
agroecological system, which should cause particular concern.</p>

is more: the lack of autoinducer-2-dependent quorum sensing promotes
competitive fitness of Escherichia coli strain 83972</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Autoinducer-2 is a signaling molecule involved in quorum sensing in
Escherichia coli. Quorum sensing enables coordinated behavior based on
cell density and helps bacteria adapt to their environment. The luxS
gene and the lsr locus are involved in the biosynthesis, transport, and
intracellular phosphorylation of autoinducer-2. Disruption of
autoinducer-2 biosynthesis or transport can reduce biofilm formation,
chemotaxis, and the expression of genes relevant for the
uropathogenicity of E. coli. Interestingly, most isolates of E. coli
phylogroup B2, in which uropathogenic and other extraintestinal
pathogenic strains are overrepresented, lack the lsr operon. We show
that autoinducer-2-dependent quorum sensing is not fundamentally
beneficial for efficient and prolonged urinary bladder colonization. We
demonstrate that the lsr-negative asymptomatic bacteriuria isolate 83972
has a higher fitness than its lsr-complemented variant. Using
transcriptome analyses, competitive growth assays, and comparisons of
selected fitness properties, we show that restoration of the lsr operon
in this strain background results in growth retardation, loss of
competitiveness, and higher sensitivity to oxidative stress. Our results
illustrate that the lack of autoinducer-2-dependent quorum sensing
contributes to the well-known fitness and competitiveness of E. coli
83972, on which its effective use for bacterial interference in the
urinary bladder relies. It is vital to delve deeper to fully understand
the fitness and competitiveness of the ABU strain 83972 if we are to
optimize its use in therapeutic colonization. The key is to unravel the
underlying molecular mechanisms, thus ensuring the efficacy and safety
of this treatment as an alternative to antibiotic therapy.</p>

probiotics in adolescents’ obesity</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The prevalence of adolescent obesity continues to rise globally,
posing significant public health challenges by affecting both physical
and psychological wellness and increasing the risk of metabolic diseases
in adulthood. Probiotics may influence obesity through various
mechanisms, including restoring gut microbiota balance, reducing chronic
inflammation, modulating lipid metabolism, aiding in weight control, and
improving metabolic health. This review aims to explore the mechanisms
by which probiotics act as key modulators of obesity and summarize
current findings from clinical trials involving probiotics in adolescent
obesity. The large-scale, multicenter, long-term follow-up randomized
controlled trials are necessary to determine the optimal probiotics
strains, dosages, and treatment durations, as well as to assess their
long-term efficacy and safety in the future. Through such rigorous
studies, probiotics have the potential to become a safe, effective, and
accessible adjunct in the comprehensive management of adolescent
obesity, offering a more holistic approach to health management for this
population.</p>

bioinformatic analysis to systematically unveil shared pathways and
molecular mechanisms underlying monkeypox and its predominant
neurological manifestations</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-02, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundMonkeypox (MPOX) is a zoonotic disease caused by the MPOX
virus (MPXV). MPOX resurfaced globally in May 2022, spreading throughout
six WHO regions, resulting in nearly 87,000 cases and 112 deaths.
Clinical symptoms include swollen lymph nodes, fever, joint pain and
several neurological complications such as headache, encephalitis,
myalgia, fatigue, photophobia and seizures. Despite these
manifestations, the precise mechanisms of MPXV’s neurotropism remain
elusive. This study aimed to explore the genetic underpinnings of
MPOX-related neurological manifestations, including headache, myalgia,
fatigue, and photophobia, using advanced bioinformatics
tools.MethodsData were sourced from the GeneCards database, which is an
integrated database of human genes. Genes linked to MPOX and its
neurological manifestations were identified and cross-referenced to
uncover shared genes between these conditions. Network visualization was
created using STRING, followed by topological analysis in Cytoscape to
identify key genes based on degree and betweenness centrality.
Functional enrichment analysis through ToppGene provided insights into
molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components
associated with these target genes. Pathway analysis was performed using
WikiPathways, and cell-type-specific enrichment was conducted using
Enrichr. Additionally, we predicted functional microRNAs using
mirTarbase and identified potential drug candidates via the Stitch
database. ResultsWe identified 32 MPOX-associated genes and a large set
of neurological manifestation-related genes. Ten hub genes, including
CD55, CXCL1, NFKB1, CXCL8, CD4, IL6, MX1, CFH, KLRK1, and CD46 were
shared between MPOX and its neurological manifestations. Five novel
genes, including CFHR3, C5AR1, C3AR1, IFNA2, and CXCL3 were predicted to
be associated with MPOX and its neurological complications. Gene
ontology analysis highlighted biological processes such as immune
regulation, viral life cycle, and lymphocyte activation, while pathway
enrichment identified critical signaling mechanisms like prostaglandin
signaling, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling, complement activation,
and neuroinflammation. Moreover, cell types such as T-helper cells,
natural killer cells, and microglia were found to be significantly
impacted by MPOX and its frequent neurological complications. We
identified 11 key microRNAs associated with MPOX-neurological
manifestations and repurposed eight potential drugs, offering promising
therapeutic strategies. ConclusionThis study emphasizes the central role
of the complement system, immunological responses, and inflammatory
pathways in the neurological manifestations of MPOX. The identification
of novel genes and predicted therapeutic targets paves the way for
future research and therapeutic interventions. Experimental validation
is required to confirm these findings and determine the effectiveness of
the proposed treatments.</p>

of fecal microbiota in newly diagnosed patients with inflammatory bowel
disease using shotgun metagenomics</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionDysbiosis is a key mechanism in inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD) pathophysiology. Previous microbiota studies in IBD
generally have involved patients treated with immunosuppressive agents,
which can affect the results. We aimed to elucidate the fecal microbiota
composition in newly diagnosed treatment-naïve IBD
patients.MethodsMicrobiota from stool samples were investigated using
shotgun metagenomics sequencing and subsequent bioinformatics
analysis.ResultsA total of 103 patients with Crohn’s disease (CD), 144
with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 49 healthy controls (HC) were
included. CD patients had significantly lower species-level diversity
than those with UC and HC. CD subgroups with Ileocolonic location and
stricturing behavior showed reduced diversity compared to HC. A negative
correlation was observed between endoscopic severity and microbial
diversity in CD patients. UC patients had similar microbial diversity to
HC, which was unaffected by disease activity. Taxonomic abundance
analysis revealed a tendency towards a higher relative abundance of
Escherichia coli and a lower relative abundance of Faecalibacterium
prausnitzii in IBD patients compared to HC. However, the most
significant differences in these patients compared to HC were observed
in less abundant species, such as Toxoplasma gondii, Gemella
morbillorum, and several species of the Adlercreutzia genera. Functional
analysis in these patients highlighted changes in carbohydrate and
nucleotide pathways.DiscussionOur data suggest that newly diagnosed CD
patients show significant microbiota composition disparities compared to
UC patients and HC. Microbiota differences in these patients are linked
to dysbiosis, characterized by a reduction in beneficial genera such as
Gemella and Adlercreutzia, and a rise in pathogenic species.</p>

single-center investigation on serotypes, drug resistance and clinical
significance of GBS isolates from pregnant and non-pregnant adults in
Baoji, China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectivesTo assess the epidemiology, serotype distribution, and
antimicrobial resistance of GBS among both pregnant and non-pregnant
adults in Baoji, China, addressing an existing gap in current
research.MethodsBased on the GBS strains identified in the clinical
laboratory from 2016 to 2024, information on age, gender, specimen type,
and diagnosis was collected for the corresponding adult cases, including
both colonization and infection cases. GBS was identified using three
methods: mass spectrometry, CAMP test and latex agglutination kit for
streptococcal serotyping. Serotypes were determined by latex
agglutination, and antimicrobial susceptibility was tested against 20
antimicrobials using an automated drug susceptibility system.ResultsA
total of 200 GBS strains were collected, in which 107 were from pregnant
women, and 93 from non-pregnant adults including 34 males. Clinical
pathogenic isolates were defined for 86 cases, in which the urinary
tract infections were predominant (61.6%), and invasive infections were
confirmed for 16 cases (18.6%). A total of 5 serotypes were identified
in the present 200 strains, including serotype Ib (34.5%), V (26.0%),
III (21.5%), Ia (2.0%) and VIII (1.0%). In addition, 30 strains (15.0%)
were non-typeable (NT). The coverage rate of the hexavalent vaccine
currently in development is 84.5%. Significant differences are observed
in the proportions of serotypes Ib, III, and/or V across various age
groups, pregnancy statuses, and between colonized and infectious
strains. Notably, the proportion of serotype V varies markedly, with
32.3% in the 18–39 age group versus 18.9% in the 40–64 age group and 10%
in the &gt;64 age group, 36.4% in pregnant women compared to 14.0% in
non-pregnant women, and 34.2% in colonized strains as opposed to 15.1%
in infectious ones. All 200 GBS strains were sensitive to penicillin,
and the resistance rates to erythromycin, azithromycin, levofloxacin,
clindamycin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol were 93.5%, 93.5%, 70.5%,
70.0%, 53.5%, and 13.0%, respectively.ConclusionThe present findings
suggest that GBS may potentially infect and colonize adults, regardless
of gender or age, in Baoji, China. Serotypes Ib, III, and V are common
serotypes, but their frequency is related to the host’s age group,
pregnancy status, and clinical relevance. GBS isolates are still
generally susceptible to penicillin.</p>

challenge of multidrug resistance in hospitalized pediatric patients
with urinary tract infections</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-01, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe choice of empirical treatment in pediatric urinary
tract infections (UTIs) is increasingly complicated by the emergence of
antibiotic resistance and the growing prevalence of multidrug-resistant
organisms (MDROs). The aim of this study is to assess the resistance
patterns of isolated uropathogens among children and adolescents
hospitalized with UTIs in Lebanon; and determine the risk factors
associated with MDRO-related UTIs over a 10-year period.MethodsA
retrospective chart review was conducted at two tertiary medical centers
in Beirut. Children and adolescents less than 18 years who were
admitted, between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2021, with the
following ICD-10 codes: “urinary tract infection”, “cystitis” and/or
“pyelonephritis “ were included. A case was excluded if the urine
culture was polymicrobial or did not meet the definition of UTI we used.
Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed
to identify risk factors for MDRO infections.ResultsAmong the 876
pediatric UTI cases included, 85% were above 2 months of age and 74.1%
were females. 64.5% of 644 Escherichia coli and 61.9% of 114 Klebsiella
spp. isolates met international MDR criteria. After a period of
fluctuation, the proportion of MDROs began to steadily increase starting
2019 eventually surpassing the 2011 percentage by nearly 10% in 2021
(67.9%, p = 0.248). Only 2.1% of MDR E. coli and 2.9% of MDR Klebsiella
spp. were resistant to carbapenems. However, aminoglycoside resistance
was high ranging between 28.3% and 48.6%. Children aged ≥ 5 years were
nearly twice as likely to present with an MDR uropathogen compared to
those &lt; 5 years of age (p &lt; 0.001). Only a history of leukemia (p
= 0.010, AOR = 4.248, 95% CI [1.412–12.778]) and antibiotic use in the
preceding 30 days (p = 0.012, AOR = 2.045, 95% CI [1.167–3.582]) were
found as independent risk factors for UTIs caused by MDROs in
multivariable logistic regression.ConclusionThis study highlights the
increasing threat of MDROs among pediatric UTIs. Recent antibiotic use
was strongly associated with MDRO infections highlighting the urgent
need for effective antimicrobial stewardship, re-evaluation of empiric
treatment guidelines, and strict abidance by infection control
measures.</p>

GenMax MTB-RIF/INH: a moderate-complexity automated NAAT for rapid
simultaneous detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and
rifampin/isoniazid resistance</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveGiven the increase of treatment failure, relapse and
acquired resistance observed in isoniazid (INH) resistance, there is an
urgent to improve rifampin (RIF) -priority based diagnostic strategies.
Therefore, we evaluated the performance of Innovo GenMax MTB-RIF/INH
(GenMax), a moderate- complexity automated nucleic acid amplification
test (NAAT), for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and
resistance to RIF and INH.MethodsAnalytical sensitivity (limit of
detection, LOD) was determined using serial dilutions of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis H37Rv (ATCC 27249) strains. Diagnostic accuracy was
assessed in clinical sputum specimens against microbiological reference
standards (MRS: positive by smear microscopy, culture or Xpert MTB/RIF
for diagnosis of TB) and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST).
Discordant results were resolved by sequencing resistance genes (IS6110,
rpoB, katG, inhA, ahpC) and follow-up diagnosis results.ResultsGenMax
demonstrated a calculated LOD of 8.8 CFU/mL (95% CI: 7.4-11.4) for MTBC,
674.1 CFU/mL (95% CI: 578.8-923.5) for RIF resistance, and 747.3 CFU/mL
(95% CI: 613.7-1081.3) for INH resistance. In clinical evaluation, the
sensitivity and specificity for MTBC detection were 97.52% (95% CI:
92.38–99.36) and 93.65% (95% CI: 88.91–96.53), respectively. For RIF and
INH resistance, sensitivities were 88.46% (95% CI: 68.72–96.97) and
85.19% (95% CI: 65.39–95.14), with specificity of 92.42% (95% CI:
82.50-97.18) and 94.12% (95% CI: 84.86-98.10).ConclusionInnovo GenMax
MTB-RIF/INH is a rapid and automated assay with high sensitivity for
MTBC detection, suitable for decentralized settings. While its
performance for RIF/INH resistance detection is competitive with
existing assays, its sensitivity remains gaps relative to WHO targets.
Further optimization, particularly through expanded probe coverage, is
needed to bridge this gap and ensure reliable detection in clinical
settings.</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Since the early 20th century, there has been extensive discussion on
the intricate relationship between pathogenic infection and tumors.
However, most studies on host-pathogen interactions are performed based
on the in-vitro culture, immortalized cell lines or animal experiments.
A significant challenge lies in accurately establishing a coculture
model between tumors and pathogens under the three-dimensional (3D)
context. Recently, the hybrid model system that incorporates 3D tumor
organoids and two-dimensional cell lines have been gradually used to
analyze the intricate relationship between pathogens and tumors, and
several coculture techniques for tumor organoids and pathogens have also
been developed. Therefore, this study systematically reviewed the
preparation and identification of tumor organoids, coculture techniques
with pathogens, and their clinical applications, aiming to further
understand and simulate the interaction mechanism between the hosts and
pathogens.</p>

a novel tetracycline resistance determinant in Streptococcus
dysgalactiae</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundStreptococcus dysgalactiae (SD) is a potent pathogen
associated with infections in a broad range of host species. Notably, a
substantial proportion of SD isolates exhibit reduced susceptibility to
tetracycline but lack identifiable resistance determinants. In the
present study, we wanted to explore the genetic basis for this low-grade
resistance to tetracycline.MethodsGenome-wide association studies were
performed on a collection of 407 SD genomes to identify potential novel
resistance determinants. Two strains of SD, belonging to each of the
subspecies dysgalactiae and equisimilis were used for mutagenesis.
Natural transformation was exploited to knock out resistance gene
candidates, and the resultant mutants were compared with their
respective wildtypes regarding susceptibility to tetracycline,
doxycycline, minocycline, tigecycline, erythromycin, gentamicin,
clindamycin and ciprofloxacin.ResultsWe identified a two gene operon,
herein designated trexAB, significantly associated with reduced
susceptibility to tetracycline. The proteins encoded by the operon were
predicted in silico to constitute a heterodimeric efflux transporter.
The knockout of trexAB led to a 16- to 32-fold reduction in minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) for tetracycline and a 4-fold reduction
in MIC for tigecycline in the investigated strains. No differences
between mutants and wildtypes were observed for other antibiotics
included in the test panel. Whole genome alignment of mutants and their
respective wildtypes revealed no differences other than the expected
differences caused by the knockout.ConclusionWe have characterized a
novel operon causing low-grade resistance to tetracycline in SD. The MIC
distribution of trexAB-positive isolates is intersected by the current
EUCAST susceptibility breakpoint, and our findings are relevant for
future revisions and determinations of adequate breakpoints for
tetracycline in S. dysgalactiae.</p>

silver nanoparticles from garlic: a novel therapeutic approach for
treating Escherichia fergusonii wound infections</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionComplicated wound infections pose a significant challenge
to patient recovery and healthcare systems, particularly due to the
emergence of less common but highly resistant multidrug-resistant (MDR)
pathogens that undermine the efficacy of conventional antibiotic
therapies. This growing threat highlights the urgent need for innovative
antimicrobial approaches. MethodologyIn this study, we synthesized
eco-friendly silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using garlic extract to combat
complicated wound infections caused by atypical MDR pathogens.
ResultsGenetic sequencing of 16S rRNA gene, aligned with phenotypic
identification methods, confirmed that Escherichia fergusonii (E.
fergusonii) as a significant atypical pathogen responsible for
complicated wound infections, with a prevalence rate of 24% (12 out of
50 cases). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that all
identified E. fergusonii strains exhibited MDR patterns. Garlic extract,
analyzed using GC-MS and UPLC-ESI-MS/MS, identified sulfur-containing
bioactive compounds such as allyl methyl trisulfide, dimethyl
trisulfide, and allicin, which facilitated the biosynthesis of AgNPs.
Stable, spherical AgNPs (15–20 nm) with strong antimicrobial properties
were confirmed under optimal conditions (10 mL garlic extract, 40°C, pH
8.0). Their properties were validated using UV-Vis spectroscopy, XRD,
and TEM. Antibacterial assays of AgNPs showed mean inhibition zones of
28±0.5 mm and MIC values of 100 µg/mL. TEM analysis revealed that AgNPs
compromised bacterial membrane integrity, leading to structural damage,
increased permeability, and leakage of intracellular contents.
Simultaneously, they induced a concentration-dependent depletion of
intracellular glutathione (GSH) in E. fergusonii, suggesting that both
membrane disruption and oxidative stress synergistically contribute to
bacterial cell lysis and death. A strong synergistic interaction was
observed between AgNPs, used at a safe concentration below 50 µM as
confirmed by cytotoxicity assays, and antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin,
as evidenced by a fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index of
0.37. Time-kill assays demonstrated rapid bacterial eradication when
AgNPs were combined with antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin.
ConclusionThese findings underscore the promise of garlic-derived silver
nanoparticles (AgNPs) as a fast-acting, eco-friendly option for treating
complex wound infections caused by atypical multidrug-resistant (MDR)
pathogens.</p>

of the erythrocyte binding proteins of the Pvfam “a” family of
Plasmodium vivax interact with Basigin to assist parasite entry into the
host cell</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Molecular mechanisms of red cell invasion by the Plasmodium vivax
parasite remain obscure since information on receptor–ligand interaction
is scarce. Several proteins of the P. vivax Pvfam “a” family are known
to bind with host erythrocytes. Some of them share their erythrocyte
receptors with each other and vice versa, but the identification of
these receptors is awaited with the exception of PvTRAg38. Here, we
demonstrate by using solid-phase binding assay and surface plasmon
resonance that majority (7 out of 10) of these erythrocyte binding
proteins (PvTRAg, PvTRAg33.5, PvTRAg35.2, PvTRAg34, PvTRAg36, PvTRAg38,
and PvTRAg69.4) interact with the erythrocyte receptor Basigin. These
interactions seem to be important for the parasite’s survival since each
of these proteins interfered with the parasite’s growth in a
heterologous culture system. Furthermore, a higher parasite growth
inhibition rate was observed with the combination of these proteins,
suggesting the significance of multiple parasite ligand’s interaction
with the same erythrocyte receptor during the invasion process. These
results will be helpful in understanding P. vivax biology and developing
the therapeutics for vivax malaria.</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis
(TB), has plagued humankind for millennia. Claiming 1.25 million lives
in 2023, TB remains the worldwide leading cause of death from a
single-infectious agent. Improved vaccines, diagnostics and treatment
regimens for drug-susceptible and drug-resistant cases are paramount to
attain the goals of the WHO’s End TB Strategy. Our knowledge gap in
protective immunity in TB impedes the development of such new vaccines
and host-directed interventions. Mtb is a pathogen highly adapted to
humans and primarily infects the lungs. Access to relevant specimens is
invasive, preventing ample human TB studies, which therefore mostly rely
on peripheral blood specimens and biopsies. Thus, there is a need for
relevant surrogates. In recent years, in vivo, in vitro, and in silico
systems have arisen to approach and model different aspects of TB
pathogenesis. Moving away from cell-line infections and classical animal
models, TB research has advanced to genetically diverse mice, 3D
organoid cultures and computational modelling. We will review current TB
models and discuss their applicability to decipher protective human
immunity, understand disease progression, transmission, as well as
evaluate vaccine candidates and unravel host-directed therapeutic
approaches.</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionProne positioning is a commonly recommended intervention
in clinical practice to enhance oxygenation in COVID-19 patients with
ARDS, but its effects on inflammatory markers in the blood and lungs
have not been thoroughly investigated.MethodsThis retrospective study
examined COVID-19-related ARDS patients admitted to the ICU of a
tertiary hospital between January 2020 and November 2023. The analysis
focused on measuring cytokines and lymphocyte subsets in both blood and
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) to evaluate the impact of prone
positioning on inflammatory markers in the lungs and systemic
circulation.ResultsOf the 86 intubated patients, 44 were included in the
study, with 30 undergoing prone positioning. Compared to the supine
position, prone positioning was associated with elevated plasma levels
of IL-12p70 and IL-4, as well as increased expression of IFN-α and TNF-α
in BALF. With increased frequency of prone positioning, oxygenation
progressively improved, accompanied by a rise in plasma IL-4 levels. No
significant differences in peripheral blood lymphocyte levels were
observed between the supine and prone groups.ConclusionThis study sheds
light on the potential mechanisms of prone positioning in both local and
systemic circulation, particularly in the context of inflammatory
markers. In COVID-19-related ARDS, prone positioning may strengthen the
immune response by modulating inflammatory markers in the lungs and
bloodstream.</p>

<p>Beyond its historical association with cervical cancer in women,
human papillomavirus (HPV) infection poses a widespread health concern,
particularly for men. Recent studies have highlighted the prevalence of
HPV-related cancers, including penile and anal cancers, among the male
population, making the case for male HPV testing all the more
compelling. The potential for cross-infection between sexual partners
underscores the need for comprehensive screening strategies. However,
challenges still remain, such as the limited availability of testing
methods and the absence of uniform medical guidelines, hampering
effective HPV detection in men. Addressing these challenges through

T cells promote tubule-interstitial damage in malaria-induced acute
kidney injury</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionMalaria acute kidney injury (MAKI) is associated with
severe malaria and correlates with poor prognosis and death of patients
infected with Plasmodium falciparum. The pathogenesis of MAKI is not
completely understood but some hypotheses are well recognized.
Host–parasite interactions lead to mechanical obstruction, disorders in
the renal microcirculation, and immune-mediated glomerular injury. We
investigated the influence of CD8⁺ T cells in the pathogenesis of
malaria-induced renal disease.MethodsTo assess the role of T lymphocytes
in MAKI pathogenesis, we used adoptive transfer; antibody-driven CD8+ T
cells depletion and treatment with FYT720.ResultsThe transference of
total T cells isolated from malaria-infected donor mice into naive
recipient animals reproduced kidney tubule-interstitial damage without
affecting glomerular function. It was associated with increased
accumulation of CD8+ T cells in the kidneys of recipient mice. The
selective depletion of CD8+ T cells in infected animals resulted in
protection from tubular injury, although glomerular alterations still
occurred. Finally, we evaluated FTY720, an immunomodulatory drug that
sequesters T cells in lymphoid organs and limits their migration, as a
potential therapeutic strategy. Treatment with FTY720 prevented the
development of proteinuria and the increase in the urine to creatinine
ratio. Moreover, FTY720 reduced urinary γ-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT)
levels, a marker of tubular injury, but did not alter plasma urea and
creatinine, two markers of glomerular function.DiscussionOur results add
new knowledge demonstrating that CD8+ T cells have a specific role in
tubule-interstitial injury pathology during MAKI.</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionInsulin resistance (IR) underlies metabolic diseases such
as obesity and diabetes. Statins are lipid-lowering drugs that have also
been studied to improve insulin resistance, but the mechanism is not
well understood. Metagenomics and metabolomics were used to analyze the
main species and metabolic pathways involved in intestinal microbes
while improving insulin resistance in mice with rosuvastatin in this
study.MethodsC57BL/6J male mice fed a high-fat diet were used to
establish the insulin resistance (IR) mouse model. Rosuvastatin (RSV)
was then administered for 8 weeks. Metagenomics and metabolomics were
utilized to analyze the microbial composition and short chain fatty acid
metabolites in intestinal feces of mice.ResultsIt was observed that
insulin-resistant mice showed significant improvement in insulin
resistance following treatment with RSV. In comparison to the HFD group,
specific bacterial strains were significantly increased, and the levels
of butyric acid, caproic acid, and isovaleric acid among the short-chain
fatty acids were notably elevated in the RSV group. Through KEGG
enrichment analysis, 19 dominant strains and 15 key enzymes involved in
butyric acid metabolism were identified.ConclusionsThe results suggested
that IR mice might enhance insulin sensitivity by promoting butyric acid
synthesis via intestinal microbes following RSV treatment.</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionDue to their content of multiple antimicrobial bioactive
substances, cell-free supernatants (CFS) from lactic acid bacteria are
emerging as novel antimicrobials. We have previously demonstrated that
CFS from Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus exert strong antibacterial and
antibiofilm activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from
chronic infections. Herein, we sought to identify the CFS fraction(s)
responsible for such activities and characterize the same CFS in terms
of immunomodulatory properties and protein content.MethodsA P.
aeruginosa clinical isolate was used in the study. CFS fractions were
obtained by 3 kDa cut-off size-exclusion filtration. The antibacterial
and antibiofilm activity of unfractionated and fractionated CFS was
tested on planktonic and biofilm-associated P. aeruginosa using
colony-forming unit enumeration, crystal violet staining, and confocal
microscopy. Label-free qualitative proteomic was performed using a
shotgun approach with mass spectrometry to characterize the protein
content of the CFS. Additionally, the immunomodulatory effects of the
CFS were evaluated on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
stimulated with P. aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or
biofilm-derived P. aeruginosa cells.ResultsBoth antibacterial and
antibiofilm activities were mainly, but not exclusively, ascribed to the
low molecular weight CFS fraction (≤ 3 kDa), which contained most of the
lactic acid, suggesting a major role of this component in the
antimicrobial effect of CFS. The &gt; 3 kDa fraction alone was almost
inactive but displayed a synergistic antibacterial effect when
reconstituted with the ≤ 3 kDa fraction. Proteomics analysis of CFS
revealed the presence of cell wall hydrolases, suggesting that these
enzymes might contribute to the antibacterial activity observed in the
reconstituted fractions. Following 6 h stimulation of PBMC with LPS or
biofilm-derived P. aeruginosa, a marked anti-inflammatory effect was
exhibited by unfractionated CFS as well as ≤ 3kDa fraction at non-toxic
concentrations, while the &gt; 3kDa fraction was found to induce the
production of IL-6, TNF-α, and to a lesser extent of IL-10.ConclusionThe
obtained results support that, due to their multiple antimicrobial and
anti-inflammatory effects, probiotic metabolites might represent a
promising strategy for the prevention and/or treatment of chronic
infections with an intense inflammatory response such as those caused by
P. aeruginosa.</p>

<p>IntroductionDetermining metabolic profiles during host-pathogen
interactions is crucial for developing novel diagnostic tests and
exploring the mechanisms underlying infectious diseases. However, the
characteristics of the circulating metabolites and their functions after
Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection have not been fully elucidated.
Therefore, this study aimed to identify the differential metabolites in
tuberculosis (TB) patients and explore the diagnostic value of these
metabolites as potential biomarkers.MethodsSeventy-two TB patients and
78 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited as the training set, while 30
TB patients and 30 HCs were enrolled as the independent validation set.
Metabolites in plasma samples were analyzed by high-resolution mass
spectrometry. Differential metabolites were screened using principal
component analysis and machine learning algorithms including LASSO,
Random Forest, and XGBoost. The diagnostic accuracy of the core
differential metabolites was evaluated. Pearson correlation analysis was
performed.ResultThe metabolic profiling of TB patients showed
significant separation from that of the HCs. In the training set, 282
metabolites were identified as differentially expressed in TB patients,
with 214 metabolites validated in the independent validation cohort.
KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that the differential
metabolites were mainly enriched in lipid metabolism. Seven core
differential metabolites were identified by the three machine learning
algorithms. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that
Angiotensin IV had high accuracy in diagnosing TB.ConclusionThese newly
identified plasma metabolites are expected to serve as potentially
valuable biomarkers for TB, potentially facilitating the diagnosis of
the disease and enhancing the understanding of its underlying
mechanisms.</p>
