<h2 id="building-your-own-atomic-bootc-desktop">Building your own Atomic
(bootc) Desktop</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>Bootc and associated tools provide the basis for building a
personalised desktop. This article will describe the process to build
your own custom installation. ↫ Daniel Mendizabal at Fedora Magazine The
fact that atomic distributions make it relatively easy to create custom
“distributions” is s really interesting bonus quality of these types of
Linux distributions. The developers behind Blue95, which we talked about
a few weeks ago, based their entire distribution on this bootc
personalised desktop approach using Fedora, and they argue that the term
“distribution” probably isn’t the correct term here: Blue95 is a
collection of scripts and YAML files cobbled together to produce a
Containerfile, which is built via GitHub Actions and published to the
GitHub Container Registry. Which part of this process elevates the
project to the status of a Linux distribution? What set of RUN commands
in the Containerfile take the project from being merely a Fedora-based
OCI image to a full-blown Linux distribution? ↫ Adam Fidel While this
discussion is mostly academic, I still find it interesting how with the
march of technology, and with the aid of new ideas, it’s becoming easier
and easier to spin up a customised version of you favourite Linux
distribution, making it incredibly easy to have your own personal ISO,
with all your settings, themes, and customisations applied. This has
always been possible, but it seems to be getting easier. Atomic,
immutable distributions are not for me, personally, but I firmly believe
most distributions focusing on average, normal users – Ubuntu, Fedora,
SUSE – will eventually move their immutable variants to the prime spot
on their web sites. This will make a whole lot of people big mad, but I
think it’s inevitable. Of course, traditional Linux distributions won’t
be going away, but much like how people keep complaining about systemd
despite the tons alternatives, I’m guessing the same will happen with
immutable distributions.</p>

<h2 id="gtk-markup-language-blueprint-becomes-part-of-gnome">GTK markup
language Blueprint becomes part of GNOME</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>This week’s This Week in GNOME mentions that Blueprint will become
part of GNOME. Blueprint is now part of the GNOME Nightly SDK and is
expected to be part of the GNOME 49 SDK. This means, apps relying on
Blueprint won’t have to install it manually anymore. Blueprint is an
alternative to defining GTK/Libadwaita user interface via .ui XML-files
(GTK Builder files). The goal of blueprint is to provide UI definitions
that require less boilerplate than XML and are easier to learn.
Blueprint also provides a language server for IDE integration. ↫ Sophie
Herold Quite a few applications already make use of Blueprint, and even
some Core GNOME applications use it, so it seems logical to make it part
of the default GNOME installation.</p>
