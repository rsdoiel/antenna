**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-05-12, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/12/peakyBlinders.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I worked my way through all six seasons of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky_Blinders_(TV_series)">Peaky Blinders</a>. I had tried it a few times before and found it hard to get started, but this time I persevered, got to know the characters, and enjoyed the stories. I knew the series was about to end as we approached the end of the final episode, and thought things were about to wind down, and then it took a little turn, no spoilers, that maybe was the best ending for any series ever. Originally I thought that honor went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Feet_Under_(TV_series)">Six Feet Under</a>, which had a kickass ending too, but when I re-watched the series recently I realized the rest of the show was pretty awful. Ever had that experience when you thought a show was great, and then re-watched it and realized it was junk? That happened with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood_(TV_series)">Deadwood</a> too. After a while I just couldn't watch it, it was so insipid. What was I even thinking the first time around? Not sure what's next on the agenda. I know I'm watching the Knicks tonight, with a certain <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/17/134201.html?title=theKnicksAndTheEpicFart">dread</a>.

## 2025-05-11 Novigrad, Rovinj, Poreƒç

date: 2025-05-12, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-05-11-novigrad-rovinj-poreƒç">2025-05-11 Novigrad, Rovinj, Poreƒç</h1>

<p>We‚Äôre spending a few days in Croatia. We took the plane to Zagreb, got a rental car and drove west to Istria. Our first station is Novigrad. The reputation for fabulous sunsets is well deserved.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-1.jpg" alt="a propeller on an airplane" /></p>

<p>First stop on the autobahn. Pistachio baklava and Apfelstrudel, coffe and sparkling water.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-2.jpg" alt="Strudel, baklava, coffee and sparkling water" /></p>

<p>Many hours later we finally arrived.
Claudia does all the driving.
I‚Äôm happy to see she‚Äôs still smiling.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-3.jpg" alt="Alex" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-4.jpg" alt="Claudia" /></p>

<p>In May, everything is still offseason.
The sunset is wonderful.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-5.jpg" alt="Sunset" /></p>

<p>The next day, we take a walk around town.
There are pools cut into the stoneworks.
But in May, I don‚Äôt feel like taking a bath.
We saw a handful of people swimming, however.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-6.jpg" alt="A flagstone waterfront with two small round pools cut out" /></p>

<p>We looked at the Loƒëa Belveder.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-7.jpg" alt="Alex sitting on a bench in a viewpoint" /></p>

<p>And then we found one of these colourful umbrella passages popular all over the world.
I mean, it‚Äôs nice to have colourful shade.
I‚Äôm not sure we need to use functional umbrellas for it.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-8.jpg" alt="A street with ropes up above, with caught up umbrellas casting a colourful shade" /></p>

<p>In the early afternoon we drove to Rovinj and jogged around.
The houses of the old town are built right to the water‚Äôs edge.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-9.jpg" alt="An old town with a tower" /></p>

<p>Because the picture above was taken against the sun, we decided to cross the isthmus and take a picture with the sun in our back. It wasn‚Äôt much better, though.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-10.jpg" alt="The same old town from another angle" /></p>

<p>We decided to get up onto the hill.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-11.jpg" alt="Alex on some easy stairs, in shorts and with a red t-shirt" /></p>

<p>On the way back we noticed little alleys going straight up or straight down towards the water.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-12.jpg" alt="Alex on some very steep stairs" /></p>

<p>Nice old cobblestone roads.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-13.jpg" alt="Narrow alleys with cobblestone roads" /></p>

<p>On the way out, we found a tree with pink flowers. üòç</p>

<p>GewoÃàhnlicher Judasbaum<br>
Cercis siliquastrum</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-14.jpg" alt="Pink flowers on a tree" /></p>

<p>We decided to drive back via Poreƒç.
Again, we jogged through town.
We saw two towers with rooftops.
This one seemed to be open.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-15.jpg" alt="Alex on a square with a three story round tower visible in the back" /></p>

<p>And it was open! We had something to drink.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-16.jpg" alt="Alex making a selfie" /></p>

<p>On the way back we decided to look at the outside of the city wall. And it was full of flowers.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-17.jpg" alt="Old walls, old houses, pink flowers, nesting oidgeons" /></p>

<p>So beautiful! üòç</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-18.jpg" alt="Pink flowers growing out of the wall" /></p>

<p>So very beautiful! üòç</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-19.jpg" alt="More pink flowers growing out of the wall" /></p>

<p>You know I can‚Äôt help myself.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-20.jpg" alt="Blue flowers" /></p>

<p>We returned to Novigrad and had dinner by the sea.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-21.jpg" alt="Claudia sitting at a table" /></p>

<p>The sunset was, once again, beautiful.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-22.jpg" alt="Yellow flowers" /></p>

<p>That park at the corner has a bunch of trees with hundreds of starlings coming home to sleep. They talk to each other and it‚Äôs the most fascinating murmuring.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-23.jpg" alt="Alex listening to the starlings" /></p>

<p>When you watched closely, the round shadows in the lower part of the tree were pine cones but at the top the round shadows moved around. These were innumerable birds trying to find a place to sleep next to each other. üòç</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-24.jpg" alt="Tree silhouette against the sunset" /></p>

<p>We sat under the trees but it was getting cold.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-25.jpg" alt="Tree silhouette and Alex sitting on the wall against the sunset" /></p>

<p>This walk was beautiful.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-26.jpg" alt="The marina area again with the pools, late in the evening" /></p>

<p>The sunset was, again, fantastic.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-05-11, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

So far Gemini has done the best job of emulating my coding style. Here's an <a href="https://g.co/gemini/share/96dad470052e">example</a>. I didn't have to instruct it in how to do it, it figured it out. Impressive. I've spent a lot of time trying and failing to get Claude and ChatGPT to work the way I work. It makes a big difference, because if I want to try out something they've offered, I have to spend time doing grunt work to get it so I can read it and understand what they're doing.

## What do I really own?

date: 2025-05-11, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I once owned a few acres of land that had some old trees on it. I sat under one of the trees on a lovely afternoon, and thought of the tree "I own you." The tree formed a thought that somehow I could tune into. "I was here long before you were born and I will be here long after you die." I didn't see it exactly as a response to my claim of ownership. But it sure did put things in perspective!</p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/11/ownership.png"></center>I thought of the tree, "I own you."</div></p>
<p>PS: I wrote that paragraph in <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/09/09/onlyStealFromTheBest.html#p9324">2011</a>. </p>
