## Using GPS for the most accurate time possible on a Mac

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Using GPS for the most accurate time possible on a Mac</span>

            <p></p>

<p>I'm deep in the rabbit hole of all things time and timing. One step on any modern horologist's journey is GPS time.</p>

<p>NIST just <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2025/04/new-atomic-fountain-clock-joins-elite-group-keeps-world-time">put NIST-F4 online</a>, accurate to within 2.2e-16 ppm (that's <code>0.00000000000000022</code> seconds. The clock is <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1681-7575/adc7bd">described in Metrologia</a> thusly:</p>

## Communications Backdoor in Chinese Power Inverters

date: 2025-05-16, updated: 2025-05-16, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>This is a <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/ar-AA1EMfHP">weird story</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>U.S. energy officials are reassessing the risk posed by Chinese-made devices that play a critical role in renewable energy infrastructure after unexplained communication equipment was found inside some of them, two people familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Over the past nine months, undocumented communication devices, including cellular radios, have also been found in some batteries from multiple Chinese suppliers, one of them said.</p>
<p>Reuters was unable to determine how many solar power inverters and batteries they have looked at...</p></blockquote>

## Installing an outdoor GPS antenna for more accurate time

date: 2025-05-15, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Installing an outdoor GPS antenna for more accurate time</span>

            <p>I've been deep into time and timing lately (more shenanigans coming tomorrow), but today I posted a video covering the install of a <a href="https://www.pctel.com/antenna-product/timing-antenna-with-integrated-lightning-protection/">PCTEL GPS/GNSS antenna</a> at my studio.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I put up the antenna after realizing how indoor GPS reception is just never that great, due to a variety of factors (like multipath propagation and interference), even if I placed my antennas up in the plenum space right under the roof. Of course, it doesn't help that my studio has a metal roof :)</p>

## 2025-05-15 Driving to Grabovac

date: 2025-05-15, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-05-15-driving-to-grabovac">2025-05-15 Driving to Grabovac</h1>

<p>Today not much happened. We ate breakfast, packed our stuff and drove to Grabovac. Claudia does all the driving. The roads were narrow and progress was slow. The 125km took us a long time. And when we arrived, we had a siesta two hours long.</p>

<p>Claudia isn’t feeling too well. At first we thought she had picked up a stomach bug somewhere but then we saw that the bottled water she was drinking (Donat) contained 1000mg of magnesium! She drank one and half litres of it for a few days. And as they say, beyond 250mg/day it starts getting weird and closer to 2500mg/day it gets dangerous.</p>

<p>When stopping for a snack in the autobahn, we like the pistachio croissant which we cannot get in Switzerland.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-grabovac-1.jpg" alt="croissant with green stuff on it" /></p>

<p>Around dinner the weather starts turning bad. Storm clouds and rain. It will be cold, tomorrow.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-grabovac-2.jpg" alt="a swimming pool with dark clouds overhead" /></p>

<p>Walking around the property, we saw these huge flowers along with some irises.</p>

<p>Clematis patens</p>

## 2025-05-14 Crikvenica

date: 2025-05-15, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-05-14-crikvenica">2025-05-14 Crikvenica</h1>

<p>Today was a no-car day and we went for a hike. First we walked along the coast to the neighbouring village of Dramalji, then up the hill and over a pass to Tribalj, then back along the Dubračina back to Crikvenica.</p>

<p>Thanks to OsmAnd for the navigation and Flora Incognita for identifying the plants late at night.</p>

<p>Pictures by Claudia and me.</p>

<p>We started along the coast, on that one-way street.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-1.jpg" alt="a street with a one-way sign" /></p>

<p>Across the sea you can see the island of Krk. We did not have the time to visit.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-2.jpg" alt="Alex and Claudia grinning at the camera, both wearing hats and sunglasses" /></p>

<p>When there are no sandy beaches, concrete slabs dot the coast for roasting tourists in summer.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-3.jpg" alt="empty concrete platforms by the sea" /></p>

<p>I like the rocks without the construction work but I guess it’s harder to get into the water.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-36.jpg" alt="The rocky coast without construction works" /></p>

<p>Then we started the ascent.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-4.jpg" alt="stairs going up" /></p>

<p>We always stop for new flowers along the way!
This one grew out of a stone wall.</p>

<p>Garten-Löwenmaul<br>
Antirrhinum majus</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-5.jpg" alt="purple flowers" /></p>

<p>Further up, more flowers grew along the way.</p>

<p>Strahlen-Breitsame<br>
Orlaya grandiflora</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-6.jpg" alt="white flowers" /></p>

<p>Even further up, we entered a landscape of salvia. This was simply the first one, growing next to the trail.</p>

<p>Echter Salbei<br>
Salvia officinalis</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-7.jpg" alt="violet flowers" /></p>

<p>Up and up, leaving the town behind.
Sometimes, stonewalls line the trail.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-8.jpg" alt="dry stone walls to the left and right of the trail" /></p>

<p>Then the walls disappear and the sun bakes us.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-9.jpg" alt="the trail is overgrown with white and yellow flowers" /></p>

<p>Megascolia maculata</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-37.jpg" alt="looks like a hornet but it is a wasp" /></p>

<p>The trail is made up of broken white rocks.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-10.jpg" alt="Claudia looking back at me" /></p>

<p>Looking back towards the sea and the island of Krk.
It&rsquo;s still steep going.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-11.jpg" alt="rough gravel trail and the ocean in the distance" /></p>

<p>Crepis neglecta</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-12.jpg" alt="yellow flowers" /></p>

<p>The trail keeps climbing. We started at sea level and the pass is at about 300 and something meters above the sea.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-13.jpg" alt="Pine trees, gravel trail, no shade" /></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t remember seeing a purple variant.</p>

<p>Gewöhnlicher Wundklee<br>
Anthyllis vulneraria</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-14.jpg" alt="purple flowers" /></p>

<p>Rapunzel-Glockenblume<br>
Campanula rapunculus</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-15.jpg" alt="violet flowers" /></p>

<p>This is what it looks like when I’m taking pictures.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-38.jpg" alt="Alex squatting on the ground, pointing the phone at a tiny flower" /></p>

<p>Flora Incognita seems to be very unsure about this one, but we saw it a lot.
Milchstern or Ornithogalum seems good to me, but which one?</p>

<p>Ornithogalum baeticum</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-16.jpg" alt="White flower" /></p>

<p>iSeek says:</p>

<p>Frühlingsmistkäfer<br>
Trypocopris vernalis</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-17.jpg" alt="Black beetles" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-39.jpg" alt="more of these strange beetles" /></p>

<p>Glucken<br>
Lasiocampidae</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-18.jpg" alt="Caterpillar" /></p>

<p>Not too long after that I nearly ran into this fellow, lowering itself from a branch by a silk strand.</p>

<p>Eulenfalter<br>
Acronicta</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-19.jpg" alt="Another caterpillar in mid air" /></p>

<p>iSeek says:</p>

<p>Schwarzer Bär<br>
Arctia villica</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-40.jpg" alt="a black butterfly with yellow dots" /></p>

<p>We reached a different biome!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-20.jpg" alt="brushes, grass, stones" /></p>

<p>We call it tick country. 😰</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-21.jpg" alt="Claudia walking along a narrow trail through higher grass and brushes" /></p>

<p>Endless sage meadows, up here.</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-42.jpg" alt="sage meadow" /></p>

<p>Far behind us, the sea is still visible.
We keep on walking.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-24.jpg" alt="Brushes, stones" />

<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-26.jpg" alt="more sage with carpenter bee" /></p>

<p>We take too many pictures.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-41.jpg" alt="Alex taking pictures of flowers" /></p>

<p>Gewöhnlicher Perückenstrauch<br>
Cotinus coggygria</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-27.jpg" alt="yellow-green flowers" /></p>

<p>We finally reached the other side.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-44.jpg" alt="a lake at the bottom of the valley" /></p>

<p>The biome changed again.
The forest is cooler and the ground is no longer dry.</p>

<p>Pfirsichblättrige Glockenblume<br>
Campanula persicifolia</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-28.jpg" alt="violet flowers" /></p>

<p>The trail is pretty steep!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-29.jpg" alt="Claudia on the trail" /></p>

<p>Luckily, there is a lot of shade.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-30.jpg" alt="A forest with slender trees and green canopy" /></p>

<p>Markings are good. We lost our way once, at the top of the pass, ending up at a plaque commemorating the fight against fascism in 1945 and 1956, I guess. I couldn’t actually read anything except the years. We turned back and soon found our way.</p>

<p>Is this the partisan trail?</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-45.jpg" alt="dry stone wall with a hiking trail marker" /></p>

<p>Rapunzel-Glockenblume<br>
Campanula rapunculus</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-31.jpg" alt="And more violet flowers" /></p>

<p>We finally reached the little river that will take us back!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-32.jpg" alt="a river, three or four meters wide" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-33.jpg" alt="the river doesn&rsquo;t carry much water, the trees grow bigger" /></p>

<p>Claudia spotted two snakes!</p>

<p>At this point the river only runs beneath the rocks. For long stretches it disappears completely.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-34.jpg" alt="here is Claudia trying to take a picture of the snake" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-47.jpg" alt="a long black snake with its head in the grass" /></p>

<p>Every now and then we see a bunch of yellow irises like the ones we have on our balcony, which we got from Claudia&rsquo;s parents&rsquo; garden pond.</p>

<p>Gelbe Schwertlilie<br>
Iris pseudacorus</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-35.jpg" alt="Giant yellow flowers" /></p>

<p>And we keep on walking!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-46.jpg" alt="Alex walking along the river" /></p>

<p>And we’re on the end stretch! 😅</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-48.jpg" alt="a bridge over the dry river" /></p>

<p><strong>Content warning: ticks!</strong></p>

<p>Remember how we joked about being on the tick trail? When we came back, we ate ice-cream, we went for a swim in the ocean, we went to the sauna, to the whirlpool, back to the sauna, back the hotel room, and a tick fell of my stuff as I stepped on the balcony! 😱 And then we examined each other and I found a tick on my wife! 😱 😱 Both ticks were still &ldquo;empty&rdquo; but that really feeds our paranoia. Now we&rsquo;re examining all our clothes from all sides before putting them on and I <em>hate</em> that feeling.</p>

## Here There Are Blueberries

On Sunday 4<sup>th</sup> May Vicky & I saw <a href="https://www.berkeleyrep.org/shows/here-there-are-blueberries/">Berkeley Rep's production</a> of a thought-provoking new play by Moisés Kaufman, Amanda Gronich, and Tectonic Theater, the team behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Laramie_Project"><i>The Laramie Project</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
about the reaction to the 1998 murder of gay University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard in Laramie, Wyoming. The murder was denounced as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_crime">hate crime</a> and brought attention to the lack of hate crime laws in various states, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming">Wyoming</a>.<br />
<br />
An example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_theatre#Verbatim_theatre">verbatim theatre</a>, the play draws on hundreds of interviews conducted by the theatre company with inhabitants of the town, company members' own journal entries, and published news reports.
</blockquote>
The new play, <a href="https://www.heretherareblueberries.com/"><i>Here There Are Blueberries</i></a>, is on tour after a 2022 premiere at the La Jolla Playhouse and a 2024 run at the New York Theatre Workshop. Vinson Cunningham reviewed the New York production in <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/05/27/here-there-are-blueberries-theatre-review"><i>The Chilling Truth Pictured in “Here There Are Blueberries”</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
There’s something awful about a lost picture. Maybe it’s because of a disparity between your original hope and the result: you made the photograph because you intended to keep it, and now that intention—artistic, memorial, historical—is fugitive, on the run toward ends other than your own. The picture, gone forever, possibly revived by strange eyes, will never again mean quite what you thought it would.
</blockquote>
The play dramatizes the process archivists at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum went through to investigate an album of photographs taken at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp">Auschwitz</a>. Photographs from Auschwitz are extremely rare because the Nazis didn't want evidence of what happened there to survive.<br />
<br />
Below the fold I discuss the play and some of the thoughts it provoked that are relevant to digital preservation.<br />

I've been interested in verbatim theatre for a long time, Not just the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Laramie_Project"><i>The Laramie Project</i></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Laramie_Project:_Ten_Years_Later"><i>The Laramie Project: Ten Years Later</i></a>, but also the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Deavere_Smith">Anna Deavere Smith</a>, David Hare's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Permanent_Way"><i>The Permanent Way</i></a>, and the amazing verbatim musical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Road_(musical)"><i>London Road</i></a>.<br />
<br />
Developing one of these plays is a painstaking process, The actors conduct extended interviews with the people they will represent, and the playwrights select and organize quotes from the interviews. And, in the case of <i>London Road</i>, set them to music.<br />
<br />
In this case most of the participants were archivists at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum who, in 2006, received an offer to donate an album of photographs from Auschwitz. Initially skeptical, archivist Rebecca Erbelding rapidly established that the more than 100 images in the album documented the life of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Friedrich_H%C3%B6cker">Karl-Friedrich Höcker</a> during the period from May to December 1944 when he served as the adjutant to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Baer_(Nazi)">Richard Baer</a>, the last commandant of Auschwitz. Thus the album became known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B6cker_Album">Höcker Album</a>.<br />
<br />

The archivists were immediately struck by the lack of any images of camp inmates. Instead, many images showed camp staff relaxing at a resort the inmates constructed for the camp called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solah%C3%BCtte">Solahütte</a>. Time off at the Solahütte was a reward for good performance. Höcker is seen at the Solahütte:<br />
<blockquote>
in the company of young women—stenographers and typists, trained at the SS school in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obernai">Obernai</a>, who were known generally as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS#SS-Frauenkorps"><i>SS Helferinnen</i></a>, the German word for (female) "helpers".

Many of the images showed Höcker with more senior SS officers including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_H%C3%B6ss">Rudolf Höss</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Mengele">Josef Mengele</a>. Some showed Höcker's home and children, including a scene with the children floating in the home's pool in a boat the inmates made for them.<br />
<br />
The survival of the album is remarkable. A US Army counter-intelligence officer was assigned to Frankfurt in the aftermath of the war. His story is that, unable to find a official billet, he occupied an abandoned apartment in whose trash he found the album. It wasn't until 2006, six decades later, that he offered it to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum.<br />

One image shows a group of about 70 soldiers at the Solahütte celebrating. It was discovered that they were celebrating the conclusion of the operation led by Adolf Eichmann to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust_in_Hungary">exterminate the Hungarian Jews from Carpathian Ruthenia</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Between 15 May and 9 July 1944, over 434,000 Jews were deported on 147 trains, most of them to Auschwitz, where about 80 percent were gassed on arrival.
</blockquote> 
Despite the celebration, the operation was less than completely successful. Before it was stopped by Miklós Horthy, the Regent of Hungary, it had only succeeded in transporting about 434,000 of Hungary's about 825,000 Jews, and killing about 350,000 of them.<br />

Strangely, the arrival of one of the trains is documented in the only other known album of photographs from Auschwitz, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_Album"><i>Auschwitz Album</i></a>. The images:<br />
<blockquote>
document the disembarkation of the Jewish prisoners from the train boxcars, followed by the selection process, performed by doctors of the SS and wardens of the camp, which separated those who were considered fit for work from those who were to be sent to the gas chambers. The photographers followed groups of those selected for work, and those selected for death, to a birch grove just outside the crematoria, where they were made to wait before being killed.
</blockquote>
The Auschwitz Album's survival is <a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/auschwitz-through-the-lens-of-the-ss-a-tale-of-two-albums?series=12">equally remarkable</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The original owner of that album, Lili Jacob (later Zelmanovic Meier), was deported with her family to <a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/narrative/3673/en">Auschwitz</a> in late May 1944 from Bilke (today: Bil'ki, Ukraine), a small town near Berehovo in Transcarpathian Rus which was then part of Hungary. They arrived on May 26, 1944, the same day that professional SS photographers photographed the arrival of the train and the selection process. Richard Baer and Karl Höcker arrived at Auschwitz mere days before the arrival of this transport. After surviving Auschwitz, forced labor in Morchenstern, a <a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/narrative/6074/en">Gross-Rosen</a> subcamp, and transfer to <a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/narrative/4909/en">Dora-Mittelbau</a> where she was liberated, Lili Jacob discovered an album containing these photographs in a drawer of a bedside table in an abandoned SS barracks while she was recovering from typhus.
</blockquote>
Because it was taken the day Jacob arrived, <a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/auschwitz-through-the-lens-of-the-ss-a-tale-of-two-albums?series=12">she</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
first found a photograph of her rabbi but then also discovered a photo of herself, many of her neighbors, and relatives, including a famous shot of her two younger brothers Yisrael and Zelig Jacob.
</blockquote>
She took the album with her as she immigrated to the United States. In 1983 she donated it to <a href="https://www.yadvashem.org/">Yad Vashem</a>, after which it was published.<br />

The title of the play, "Here There Are Blueberries", is the caption of a series of images showing Höcker serving blueberries to a group of Helferinnen at the Solahütte.<br />
<br />
Höcker served 18 months in a British POW camp before resuming his pre-war life as a bank cashier. In 1963 he was tried in Frankfurt and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Friedrich_H%C3%B6cker#Post-war_trials">sentenced to 7 years</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Höcker denied having participated in the selection of victims at Birkenau or having ever personally executed a prisoner. He further denied any knowledge of the fate of the approximately 400,000 Hungarian Jews who were murdered at Auschwitz during his term of service at the camp. Höcker was shown to have knowledge of the genocidal activities at the camp, but could not be proved to have played a direct part in them. In post-war trials, Höcker denied his involvement in the selection process. While accounts from survivors and other SS officers all but placed him there, prosecutors could locate no conclusive evidence to prove the claim.
</blockquote>
In 1989 he was tried again and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Friedrich_H%C3%B6cker#Post-war_trials">sentenced to 4 years</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
On 3 May 1989 a district court in the German city of Bielefeld sentenced Höcker to four years imprisonment for his involvement in gassing murders of prisoners, primarily Polish Jews, in the Majdanek concentration camp in Poland. Camp records showed that between May 1943 and May 1944 Höcker had acquired at least 3,610 kilograms of Zyklon B poisonous gas for use in Majdanek from the Hamburg firm of Tesch & Stabenow.
</blockquote>
Obviously, many of the thoughts provoked by the play are relevant to current events, about how one would have behaved and how bureaucrats can compartmentalize their lives so as to claim ignorance of the activities they administer, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Friedrich_H%C3%B6cker#Post-war_trials">Höcker did in his first trial</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
I only learned about the events in Birkenau…in the course of time I was there… and I had nothing to do with that. I had no ability to influence these events in any way…neither did I want them, nor carry them out. I didn’t hurt anybody… and neither did anyone die at Auschwitz because of me.
</blockquote>
The other set of thoughts are relevant to digital preservation. Obviously, the negatives of the photographs in the two albums did not survive. Individual prints from the negatives did not survive. The images survive because in both cases a set of prints was selected and bound into an album, which protected them. Once the albums had been discovered, their survival for many decades was well within the capabilities of the officer and the survivor. "Benign neglect" was all that was needed. A few of the prints suffered visible water damage, but this didn't impair their value as historical documents.<br />
<br />
Compared to WW2, many more images and videos documenting the events currently under way in Ukraine, Gaza, Myanmar, Syria, and many other places are being captured. But they are captured in digital form, and this makes their survival over enough decades to be used in war crimes trials and as the basis for histories unlikely. They may be collected into "albums" on physical media or in cloud services, but neither provides the protection of a physical album. The survival for many decades of such digital albums is well beyond the capabilities of those who took, or who found them. This fact should allow the perpetrators of today's atrocities to sleep much easier at night.<br />
<br />
Before they were delivered to preservation experts the survivor and the officer had custody of their albums for four and six decades respectively. Four decades is way longer than the expected service life of any digital medium in common use; images and video on physical media require the custodian proactively to migrate them to new media at intervals.  "Benign neglect" does not pay the rent for cloud storage, and trusting to the whims of the free cloud storage services is likely to be neglect but hardly benign.<br />
<br />
To improve the chances of current-day albums analogous to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_Album">Auschwitz Album</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B6cker_Album">Höcker Album</a> we need a consumer-grade long-lived storage medium that is cheap enough for everyday use. Alas, for the reasons I set out in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/03/archival-storage.html"><i>Archival Storage</i></a>, we are extremely unlikely to get it.<br />

## 2025-05-13 Opatija, Crikvenica

date: 2025-05-14, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-05-13-opatija-crikvenica">2025-05-13 Opatija, Crikvenica</h1>

<p>We stopped in Opatija. The settlement along a lake along a steep hill reminded me of Lausanne or Neufchâtel in Switzerland. There were hollow ruins as well as fancy new Grand Hotels, some with an ancient Viennese flair. To me, that’s weird. To chase the colonised past for tourism cash? 🫤 Didn’t the Austrians use Croatian troops to out down Italian revolts and the like? Well, after the Austro-Hungarian empire fell apart, the Italians took over Opatija but then the communists pushed them ought.</p>

<p>Visiting former Yugoslavia is dreadful from a history perspective because when I was a teenager the civil war and the breakup of the country was always there, in the back of my mind. Watching <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warriors_(1999_TV_series)">Warriors</a> many years later was the worst, though.</p>

<p>Hearing so many Austrians on the streets is weird.</p>

<p>I guess I felt a little bit of Austrian empire shame. 😳</p>

<p>Claudia also decided to contribute some pictures, seeing how I hadn’t noticed that the lens had gotten smeared with sun lotion.</p>

<p>We had parked the car in the parking lot of a crumbling hotel ruin.</p>

Here's why. As long as there are lots of good podcasts available for listening to via RSS on phones, every competitive 'caster is going to want to be there, because their competitors are. And as long as I can get a good selection of interesting stuff to listen to on my phone, there's no reason look elsewhere. And as far as I know I can't listen to a YouTube "podcast" in my car or when walking. One more thing, please stop using death metaphors re RSS.

It was a way of earning points from the people who ran Twitter and tech conferences like SXSW, basically asshole-like people who wanted to close the door on the open web. And now here we are 2.5 decades later and people are <i>still</i> doing it. You should self-censor on that one, those people are long-gone, probably doing stuff with crypto or nuzzling up to oligarchs, and you're keeping their asshole-ness alive. That's pretty fucked up.

I&#8217;ve been letting these posts about my reading slip recently, for reasons of general busy-ness.

## About the Baseline theme

date: 2025-05-14, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Scott Hanson has been working on the <a href="https://wordland.shanson.de/2025/05/13/how-to-install-baseline/">Baseline theme</a> and it's ready for people to try out. </p>
<p>An important caveat. This theme was designed to be the beginning theme for WordLand-authored WordPress sites. </p>
<p>The goal is to get the minimal features for a nice blog-oriented site running in WordPress. </p>
<p>It's open source, so you can start with Baseline and add all the features you want.</p>
<p>And Scott has said he'd be happy to work with others to make it so that it would be great for presenting non-WordLand-authored writing. </p>
<p>As the developer of <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>, I wanted to go back to the beginning and take fresh a approach to the way blogs implement various features in 2025. It's been a long time since we took a fresh look, and lots has happened since. The market has grown by orders of magnitude, and new user interfaces have become widely used, especially with social media apps. WordLand itself has been heavily influenced by Facebook and Twitter, for example, even though blogging predates both. So of course the <i>presentation</i> of the blog has opportunities to evolve as well.</p>
<p>The bottom-line -- if you already have a WordPress theme you're happy with, then stick with it, no need to use Baseline. But if you're starting a fresh site, using WordLand as your editor, and you value simplicity, then I recommend trying it, and if you like it, keep using it.</p>
<p>BTW, I have it installed on <a href="https://daveverse.org/">daveverse.org</a>, and I'm a happy camper. So we have one endorsement. It's a good start. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>
<p>PS: If you have comments or questions, here's a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/88">good place</a> to post them. </p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-05-13, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/13/knickGameCard.png" style="float: right; border: 1px solid silver; margin-left: 10px;">This is what it says on Google about tomorrow night's Knicks game vs the Celtics in Boston. I've pointed the red arrow at the part that makes me think I must be dreaming. <i>NYK leads 3-1.</i> Yesterday at this time (5:30PM Eastern) I was in a funk, sure that the Knicks were about to be obliterated by the Celtics who had blown out the Knicks on Saturday, and the beginning of last night's game confirmed that suspicion. The Knicks couldn't seem to hit a shot, and the Celtics were hitting 3-pointers over and over and over and over. My body chemistry shifted. I felt the doom members of an ancient tribe of primitive humans must have felt as we were losing a war for existence with a neighboring tribe. It's primitive, but it's real. However! In the second half it turned around. The Knicks came out with a purpose, unlike the previous two wins, this one was not a squeaker at the end. The Knicks were masterful. They won this game, not by luck or perseverence, rather simply by <i>being better</i> than the Celtics. The reigning champion Celtics who must've relaxed just enough to fuel the victory for the hometown boys. So we're up 3-1 now. The Celtics have to win the next three. If they lose one, it's over. No I didn't think we'd be here tonight. Remember that when you feel sure you know that something is going to turn out a certain way. You just never know, it could come out a different way, as unbelievable as that might be.

## 2025-05-11 Novigrad, Rovinj, Poreč

date: 2025-05-12, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-05-11-novigrad-rovinj-poreč">2025-05-11 Novigrad, Rovinj, Poreč</h1>

<p>We’re spending a few days in Croatia. We took the plane to Zagreb, got a rental car and drove west to Istria. Our first station is Novigrad. The reputation for fabulous sunsets is well deserved.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-1.jpg" alt="a propeller on an airplane" /></p>

<p>First stop on the autobahn. Pistachio baklava and Apfelstrudel, coffe and sparkling water.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-2.jpg" alt="Strudel, baklava, coffee and sparkling water" /></p>

<p>Many hours later we finally arrived.
Claudia does all the driving.
I’m happy to see she’s still smiling.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-3.jpg" alt="Alex" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-4.jpg" alt="Claudia" /></p>

<p>In May, everything is still offseason.
The sunset is wonderful.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-5.jpg" alt="Sunset" /></p>

<p>The next day, we take a walk around town.
There are pools cut into the stoneworks.
But in May, I don’t feel like taking a bath.
We saw a handful of people swimming, however.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-6.jpg" alt="A flagstone waterfront with two small round pools cut out" /></p>

<p>We looked at the Lođa Belveder.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-7.jpg" alt="Alex sitting on a bench in a viewpoint" /></p>

<p>And then we found one of these colourful umbrella passages popular all over the world.
I mean, it’s nice to have colourful shade.
I’m not sure we need to use functional umbrellas for it.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-8.jpg" alt="A street with ropes up above, with caught up umbrellas casting a colourful shade" /></p>

<p>In the early afternoon we drove to Rovinj and jogged around.
The houses of the old town are built right to the water’s edge.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-9.jpg" alt="An old town with a tower" /></p>

<p>Because the picture above was taken against the sun, we decided to cross the isthmus and take a picture with the sun in our back. It wasn’t much better, though.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-10.jpg" alt="The same old town from another angle" /></p>

<p>We decided to get up onto the hill.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-11.jpg" alt="Alex on some easy stairs, in shorts and with a red t-shirt" /></p>

<p>On the way back we noticed little alleys going straight up or straight down towards the water.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-12.jpg" alt="Alex on some very steep stairs" /></p>

<p>Nice old cobblestone roads.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-13.jpg" alt="Narrow alleys with cobblestone roads" /></p>

<p>On the way out, we found a tree with pink flowers. 😍</p>

<p>Gewöhnlicher Judasbaum<br>
Cercis siliquastrum</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-14.jpg" alt="Pink flowers on a tree" /></p>

<p>We decided to drive back via Poreč.
Again, we jogged through town.
We saw two towers with rooftops.
This one seemed to be open.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-15.jpg" alt="Alex on a square with a three story round tower visible in the back" /></p>

<p>And it was open! We had something to drink.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-16.jpg" alt="Alex making a selfie" /></p>

<p>On the way back we decided to look at the outside of the city wall. And it was full of flowers.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-17.jpg" alt="Old walls, old houses, pink flowers, nesting oidgeons" /></p>

<p>So beautiful! 😍</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-18.jpg" alt="Pink flowers growing out of the wall" /></p>

<p>So very beautiful! 😍</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-19.jpg" alt="More pink flowers growing out of the wall" /></p>

<p>You know I can’t help myself.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-20.jpg" alt="Blue flowers" /></p>

<p>We returned to Novigrad and had dinner by the sea.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-21.jpg" alt="Claudia sitting at a table" /></p>

<p>The sunset was, once again, beautiful.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-22.jpg" alt="Yellow flowers" /></p>

<p>That park at the corner has a bunch of trees with hundreds of starlings coming home to sleep. They talk to each other and it’s the most fascinating murmuring.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-23.jpg" alt="Alex listening to the starlings" /></p>

<p>When you watched closely, the round shadows in the lower part of the tree were pine cones but at the top the round shadows moved around. These were innumerable birds trying to find a place to sleep next to each other. 😍</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-24.jpg" alt="Tree silhouette against the sunset" /></p>

<p>We sat under the trees but it was getting cold.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-25.jpg" alt="Tree silhouette and Alex sitting on the wall against the sunset" /></p>

<p>This walk was beautiful.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-26.jpg" alt="The marina area again with the pools, late in the evening" /></p>

<p>The sunset was, again, fantastic.</p>

## 2025-05-12 Novigrad – Dajla

date: 2025-05-12, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-05-12-novigrad-dajla">2025-05-12 Novigrad – Dajla</h1>

<p>Today was a no-car day. Yay! We got up, had breakfast, went for a walk, came back, and went for a slow 16km jog along the coast, with a stop for water and palačinke (crêpes). So nice!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-12-dajla-1.jpg" alt="a screenshot of a map with our route" /></p>

<p>A jasmine closeup.
Or so I thought. The smell was so strong.
But then again, it didn’t quite look like the jasmin I saw in Thailand. And Flora Incognita says:</p>

<p>Chinesischer Klebsame<br>
Pittosporum tobira</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-12-dajla-2.jpg" alt="white flowers" /></p>

<p>Looks like cloves I thought. Stand amidst some clover, I thought. But the app says:</p>

<p>Gegliederter Sauerklee<br>
Oxalis articulata</p>

<p>What? Learning new thin gs every day!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-12-dajla-3.jpg" alt="pink flowers with leaves consisting of three parts" /></p>

<p>On the run, along some olive trees…</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-12-dajla-4.jpg" alt="olive trees" /></p>

<p>On and on…</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-12-dajla-5.jpg" alt="a dirt road between trees" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-12-dajla-6.jpg" alt="a dirt road and the icean visible between the trees" /></p>

<p>Italienischer Aronstab<br>
Arum italicum</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-12-dajla-7.jpg" alt="a big leaf pointing up, wrapped around a yellow rod" /></p>

<p>Alex and Claudia on the run. Happy!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-12-dajla-8.jpg" alt="I’m wearing a hat against the sun" /></p>

<p>The beach is always stony, never sandy.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-12-dajla-9.jpg" alt="bushes separating dirt track from the ocean" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-12-dajla-10.jpg" alt="more rocks" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-12-dajla-11.jpg" alt="pine trees on the coast" /></p>

<p>The trail took us through camping grounds and endless holiday bungalow settlements, most of them empty. If you ever come here, don’t come between June and September because the infrastructure here is built of a gazillion tourists. May is great, I’d say. But we’ve been very lucky with the weather.</p>

## How to make a Link Aggregator in Obsidian

date: 2025-05-12, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>I’m finishing up my move from Notion to Obsidian and one complexity I encountered was all my saved links. In the almost seven years of using Notion, I amassed a ~1.2 GB database of links. This is because of how the Notion Web Clipper creates a backup of the article and its assets. While this is gold to an internet archivist… I really only use this feature to sneak around paywalls. Moving to Obsidian gave me a chance to rethink my link collection process and along the way I figured out how to make an automated Link Aggregator that I could parlay into a newsletter-like blog post.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Install Obsidian Web Clipper</h2>
<p>The first step was to capture links. I had looked at <a href="https://medium.com/@_jonas/quick-bookmarks-clippings-in-obsidian-3050d375697a">creating a custom bookmarklet</a>, but as I rolled this out across my iPad, iPhone, personal computer, and work computer, the foundation wasn’t sturdy. If I made a change in how I wanted it to work, I’d have to manually edit half-a-dozen JavaScript bookmarklets. The path of least resistance was to embrace Obsidian Web Clipper, the community standard browser extension for this sort of task instead that is available in all browsers.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/obsidian-web-clipper-add-item-popup.jpg" alt="The Obsidian Add Item Popup window with fields like title, tags, description, and published date" /></p>
<p>Obsidian Web Clipper actually solves a long-standing issue I had with Notion Web Clipper, I couldn’t add tags in the “Add Item” workflow, you had to bounce out to the app and manage it there. Obsidian Web Clipper let’s you add tags right there in the “Add Item” window. But it’s not all roses because Obsidian will <em>always</em> bounce you out to the application for saving. Weirdly –because it’s the same as what I didn’t like about Notion– I don’t mind this in Obsidian because it gives me a chance to review the content I’m digitally hoarding.</p>
<p>Obsidian Web Clipper will also scrape the text, which is handy for retrieval later, but critically it doesn’t save images and hotlinks to the production assets. This might upset archivists, but as someone who doesn’t want a 1.2 GB link database again, I welcome it.</p>
<p>I know AI is a controversial topic, but this is one place I would welcome an LLM to summarize articles and provide some bullet points for reference later. Perhaps a short list of other publications that have referenced this article as well? I’m spit-balling, but I don’t need scraped text, what I need is something to jog my memory.</p>
<p>If I had more time, I’d grab some quotes I found interesting and <a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/">do like Jim does</a> and add my own thoughts and notes as a response. Are “reaction blogs” a thing? I guess they are.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/obsidian-web-clipper-settings.jpg" alt="The Obsidian Web Clipper Settings page where you customize the fields you want to see for your link template" /></p>
<p>The one change I make to the Default template is to remove some fields and set my default Note Location folder to “Inputs/Links”. This is unique to how I have my vault organized (more on that later), but links are easy to accumulate and I find having a dedicated bucket for them will save you cognitive load later.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Write a brief summary</h2>
<p>My link aggregation process has one mandatory process step: Write a brief summary. A short tweet-length description of why I found this link interesting or useful. This is akin to the “WHY?” column in a database that we’ve been discussing on Shop Talk this year. Why was this link cool enough to collect? Why did I find it interesting? What were my thoughts?</p>
<p>Actual human thoughts are becoming a valuable commodity these days.</p>
<p>In Obsidian Web Clipper there’s a <code>description</code> field that by default grabs the document description meta tag. This is not useful most of the time, but can give you some text to shape if you’re in a hurry.</p>
<h2>Step 3: Generate a DataView</h2>
<p>The last step is to create a New Note called “Link Aggregator” to generate a list of links I can copy over to a Markdown file in my blog. To do that I use the <a href="https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/">Dataview</a> plugin, which allows you to use an SQL-like query language to generate a <code>LIST</code> or <code>TABLE</code> of content based on your query.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>```dataview
LIST WITHOUT ID elink(file.frontmatter.source, file.name)+
                ": "+file.frontmatter.description
FROM "Inputs/Links"
WHERE file.ctime &gt;= date(today) - dur(1 week)
SORT file.name ASC
```
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>There’s a lot to Dataview, but this query will generate a list of external links from my Links folder that I added within the last week. Now I can slurp up those links and put them in a blog post or newsletter.</p>
<p>Process-wise, I have to copy the Dataview-generated list into a New Note in Obsidian because copying the text from the Link Aggregator page to my blog pastes the Dataview query. Creating a dummy Note isn’t ideal but at least I have a workaround. I’m sure I’m one plugin away from being able to export markdown from a Dataview query.</p>
<h2>Happy Aggregating!</h2>
<p>Like other ideas in my life, I’ve tried to make this as low-effort as possible or else I won’t do it. I think I have a system in place that allows me to do what I was already doing (collect links), but a more efficient and effective way to do something I want to do more (share links). If this is useful, feel free to steal this idea and make your own aggregator.</p>
<p>The Web is a network of content, let’s build the network. Blogs linking to other blogs are the best blogs, let’s not lose that part of blogging. We are in algorithmic content bubbles looking at different Internets, let’s pop those bubbles by sharing what we find in our Internet journeys.</p>

I had tried it a few times before and found it hard to get started, but this time I persevered, got to know the characters, and enjoyed the stories. I knew the series was about to end as we approached the end of the final episode, and thought things were about to wind down, and then it took a little turn, no spoilers, that maybe was the best ending for any series ever. Originally I thought that honor went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Feet_Under_(TV_series)">Six Feet Under</a>, which had a kickass ending too, but when I re-watched the series recently I realized the rest of the show was pretty awful. Ever had that experience when you thought a show was great, and then re-watched it and realized it was junk? That happened with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood_(TV_series)">Deadwood</a> too. After a while I just couldn't watch it, it was so insipid. What was I even thinking the first time around? Not sure what's next on the agenda. I know I'm watching the Knicks tonight, with a certain <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/05/17/134201.html?title=theKnicksAndTheEpicFart">dread</a>.

So far Gemini has done the best job of emulating my coding style. Here's an <a href="https://g.co/gemini/share/96dad470052e">example</a>. I didn't have to instruct it in how to do it, it figured it out. Impressive. I've spent a lot of time trying and failing to get Claude and ChatGPT to work the way I work. It makes a big difference, because if I want to try out something they've offered, I have to spend time doing grunt work to get it so I can read it and understand what they're doing.

## What do I really own?

date: 2025-05-11, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I once owned a few acres of land that had some old trees on it. I sat under one of the trees on a lovely afternoon, and thought of the tree "I own you." The tree formed a thought that somehow I could tune into. "I was here long before you were born and I will be here long after you die." I didn't see it exactly as a response to my claim of ownership. But it sure did put things in perspective!</p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/11/ownership.png"></center>I thought of the tree, "I own you."</div></p>
<p>PS: I wrote that paragraph in <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/09/09/onlyStealFromTheBest.html#p9324">2011</a>. </p>
