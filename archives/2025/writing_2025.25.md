## Landfall by James Bradley: Review by Ian Mond

## Portalmania by Debbie Urbanski: Review by Niall Harrison

<p>Portalmania, Debbie Urbanski (Simon &#38; Schuster 978-1-6680-6111-4, $18.99, 320pp, tp) May 2025.</p>
<p>For anyone who reads Debbie Urbanski’s debut collection <strong>Portalmania </strong>after being primed by <strong>Metallic Realms</strong>’s typology of contemporary SF writers, it is an understandable first reaction (be­cause I had it myself) to initially file her as a Jane Noh Johnson, because there are similarities with the deadpan strangeness and structural playful­ness of writers like Kelly Link and  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/06/portalmania-b-by-debbie-urbanski-review-by-niall-harrison/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## 'Meandering Scars': How One Filmmaker Uses Storytelling as a Tool for Disability Advocacy

<p>When Allison Norlian and her filmmaking partner, Kody Leibowitz, set out to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro, they knew they would need a lot more gear than good hiking boots, a sleeping bag and a map. They needed cameras, sound equipment and a protagonist given they were also planning to shoot and co-direct their first feature documentary.

## Screenwriting Wisdom from Liz Craft: Showrunner & ‘Happier in Hollywood’ Co-Host Breaks It Down

date: 2025-06-26, from: Final Draft blog

</div> 
<p>What makes a successful writer tick? How do they handle bad news? How have others changed their lives and how do they pay it forward?&nbsp;<br><br>If you want to learn from the best, you’ve come to the right place. Read on below for a glorious dive into the mind of Liz Craft, host of the popular podcast ‘<a href="https://happierinhollywood.com/">Happier in Hollywood</a>’ whose writing credits include <span style="font-style: italic;">The Shield, Lie To Me, The Vampire Diaries, The 100</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Fantasy Island</span>.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">FD: Let’s dig in! Now, because you already have a flourishing Substack and popular podcast, you already share so much information and advice with writers. But for anybody who maybe hasn’t listened to your podcast yet, do you have a favorite episode to recommend?&nbsp;</span><br><br>That’s a good question. The podcast is called Happier in Hollywood. I host it with my writing partner Sarah Fain. And we have a <a href="https://happierinhollywoodpod.substack.com/">Substack</a> with the same name. We actually put together a list of our <a href="https://happierinhollywoodpod.substack.com/p/top-20-hih-episodes-for-television">favorite 20 episodes</a>, the best ones for aspiring TV writers.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">FD: In addition to the podcast, you and Sarah have also written some books. Do you have any advice for screenwriters interested in dipping their toes in the book-writing pool? Are there ways that the process of writing a book was similar or different than breaking a story for a studio?&nbsp;</span><br><br>Yeah, definitely. I think it’s helpful to have the experience of breaking story from screenwriting. What’s odd is how much you can write with a book. It’s really hard to get used to a lot of description and interior monologue because of course we have almost none of that, certainly no interior monologue, in a script. So that is a muscle that we’re having to learn to flex over and over again. I also think that in novel writing, you leave more room for the story to unfold as you write than one does in screenwriting because, you know, we always break a story completely before writing an episode of something or a pilot, but writing a novel, I think many writers leave more room for finding out the story as they write. &nbsp;</p>

<p>One thing you can rely on science fiction for is a bit of self-mythologisation. Probably every literary field (probably every field of any kind) does a bit of it, but from the Futurians and the Science Fiction League onwards, and among both elite writing groups and local fan groups, science fiction has a tradition of convert­ing anecdote to  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/06/metallic-realms-by-lincoln-michel-review-by-niall-harrison/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

“Market dilution” suggests that “using copyrighted books to train an LLM might harm the market for those works because it enables the rapid generation of countless works that compete with the originals, even if those works aren’t themselves infringing.”

## How the Writers of ‘I Don’t Understand You’ Are Rewriting Horror-Comedy Rules

date: 2025-06-25, from: Final Draft blog

<div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"> 
 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/how-the-writers-of-i-dont-understand-you-are-rewriting-horror-comedy-rules" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/Andrew%20Rannells%20and%20Nick%20Kroll%20in%20I%20Dont%20Understand%20You%20%282%29.png" alt="Standing in the dark, Nick Kroll holds a lit match in front of himself and Andrew Rannells in I Don't Understand You " class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<p>Written and directed by David Joseph Craig and Brian Crano, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27623406/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_i%2520don%27t%2520understand%2520you"><em>I Don’t Understand You</em></a> is a horror-comedy that unabashedly pushes the limits of both the horror and comedy genres. Starring Nick Kroll and Andrew Rannells as a married couple on the verge of adopting a baby, they take a Babymoon to Italy where they soon realize they are in over their heads when it comes to understanding the language, food, culture – and each other. While the fish out of water scenario provides great farcical comedy, the horror aspects slowly begin to creep in as the humor grows darker.<br><br>“We set out to write a horror movie with comedic flares,” says Craig, “but we ended up with a comedy that had horror flares. It just evolved that way.”<br><br>David Joseph Craig and Brian Crano are married in real life and are as sharp, witty and possibly as lovingly bumbling as the characters they inspired on screen. The couple met on a blind date that their agent set up for them. “It was a very interesting, Hollywood-ish way to meet,” says Craig, adding, “But it’s 15 years later, so it worked out!”&nbsp;<br><br>After adopting a baby in real-life, Craig and Crano found themselves spending a lot of time together during COVID and wanted a shared creative outlet. “It started in the living room. We had just had our son. It was the beginning of the pandemic. We had an infant sleeping on us, and we were like, ‘What if we started writing this movie together?’” Crano says.<br><br>Projecting their Final Draft document onto their TV screen, writing together began as a fun way to fill the time. Crano describes a moment when he wrote a character inspired by Craig. As he typed COLE, 35, <span style="font-style: italic;">but</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">admits</span> to 32, Craig ruffled, saying, “You can’t say that!” Finally conceding that the description was both hilarious and authentic, Craig agreed to keep it in the script. As they got to the heart of each other’s insecurities on the page, they both knew they were onto something.&nbsp;<br><br>“We could make fun of each other through this process,” Crano says, “and that was entertaining enough to keep us sane.”<br><br>The film’s early scenes are pulled from their real lives, including the emotional rollercoaster of the adoption process. But rather than turn it into a straight drama, the couple decided to use genre as a vehicle to explore – and then bust open – the familiar tropes of LGBTQ+ stories.<br><br>“So many portrayals of adoption on screen paint the birth mother as a villain,” says Crano. “But that couldn’t have been further from our experience. We wanted to make the birth mother the hero of the film, and let the gay characters, for once, be the ones who go off the rails.”</p>
