<h2 id="whats-the-carbon-footprint-of-using-chatgpt">What’s the carbon
footprint of using ChatGPT?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-06, updated: 2025-05-06, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://www.sustainabilitybynumbers.com/p/carbon-footprint-chatgpt">What's
the carbon footprint of using ChatGPT?</a></strong>
</p>
Inspired by Andy Masley’s
<a href="https://andymasley.substack.com/p/a-cheat-sheet-for-conversations-about">cheat
sheet</a> (which I
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/29/chatgpt-is-not-bad-for-the-environment/">linked
to</a> last week) Hannah Ritchie explores some of the numbers herself.
</p>
<p>
Hanah is Head of Research at Our World in Data, a Senior Researcher at
the University of Oxford
(<a href="https://www.sustainabilitybynumbers.com/about">bio</a>) and
maintains a <a href="https://www.sustainabilitybynumbers.com/">prolific
newsletter</a> on energy and sustainability so she has a <em>lot</em>
more credibility in this area than Andy or myself!
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
My sense is that a lot of climate-conscious people feel guilty about
using ChatGPT. In fact it goes further: I think many people judge others
for using it, because of the perceived environmental impact. […]
</p>
<p>
But after looking at the data on individual use of LLMs, I have stopped
worrying about it and I think you should too.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The inevitable counter-argument to the idea that the impact of ChatGPT
usage by an individual is negligible is that aggregate user demand is
still the thing that drives these enormous investments in huge data
centers and new energy sources to power them. Hannah acknowledges that:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I am <em>not</em> saying that AI energy demand, on aggregate, is not a
problem. It is, even if it’s “just” of a similar magnitude to the other
sectors that we need to electrify, such as cars, heating, or parts of
industry. It’s just that individuals querying chatbots is a relatively
small part of AI’s total energy consumption. That’s how both of these
facts can be true at the same time.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Meanwhile Arthur Clune
<a href="https://clune.org/posts/environmental-impact-of-ai/">runs the
numbers</a> on the potential energy impact of some much more severe
usage patterns.
</p>
<p>
Developers burning through $100 of tokens per day (not impossible given
some of the LLM-heavy development patterns that are beginning to emerge)
could end the year with the equivalent of a short haul flight or 600
mile car journey.
</p>
<p>
In the panopticon scenario where all 10 million security cameras in the
UK analyze video through a vision LLM at one frame per second Arthur
estimates we would need to duplicate the total usage of Birmingham, UK -
the output of a 1GW nuclear plant.
</p>
<p>
<p>Let’s not build that panopticon!</p>

<h2 id="saying-hi-to-microsofts-phi-4-reasoning">Saying “hi” to
Microsoft’s Phi-4-reasoning</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-06, updated: 2025-05-06, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
Microsoft released a new sub-family of models a few days ago: Phi-4
reasoning. They introduced them in
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/one-year-of-phi-small-language-models-making-big-leaps-in-ai/">this
blog post</a> celebrating a year since the release of Phi-3:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Today, we are excited to introduce <strong>Phi-4-reasoning</strong>,
<strong>Phi-4-reasoning-plus</strong>, and
<strong>Phi-4-mini-reasoning</strong> - marking a new era for small
language models and once again redefining what is possible with small
and efficient AI.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
All three of the new models are released under the MIT license, as is
the case with previous Phi models.
</p>
<p>
They’re available through <a href="https://ollama.com/">Ollama</a> as
<a href="https://ollama.com/library/phi4-reasoning/tags">phi4-reasoning</a>
(which includes the plus model) and
<a href="https://ollama.com/library/phi4-mini-reasoning/tags">phi4-mini-reasoning</a>.
</p>
<p>
These models appear to have a tendency to overthink!
</p>
<h4 id="trying-it-out-with-ollama">
Trying it out with Ollama
</h4>
<p>
I ran it using Ollama and
<a href="https://github.com/taketwo/llm-ollama">llm-ollama</a> like
this. Fetching the model downloaded 11GB of data:
</p>
<pre><code>ollama pull phi4-reasoning
llm install llm-ollama
</code></pre>
<p>
Then I said “hi” to it:
</p>
<pre><code>llm -m phi4-reasoning:latest hi
</code></pre>
<p>
Here’s the full response, which starts with a thought section wrapped in
<code>&lt;think&gt;</code> tags:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>&lt;think&gt;</code>User says “hi”. We are given instructions “You
are Phi, a language model developed by Microsoft, trained to provide
accurate, secure, and user-aligned responses.” There is additional
information. Now I must answer “hi” message from the user.
</p>
<p>
Step 1: Read the instructions carefully: The conversation text instructs
us that we are “Phi”, with internal guidelines provided in system
instructions. But our answer should be safe according to these
instructions. We need to produce a response that says hello and greet
back. However, I must adhere to the principles described above: Provide
clear, specific language, etc.
</p>
<p>
I must not mention any chain-of-thought or guidelines.
</p>
<p>
Now instructions “hi” are from user. So we say “Hello! How can I help
you?” But must include disclaimers for sensitive topics? Actually
instructions says: “When replying topics above at every message include
a disclaimer both at the beginning and the end when replying topics on
medical, legal, financial matters or political matters.” But our answer
“hi” is not such topic. So we can say “Hi! I’m Phi, how may I help you?”
but no disclaimers required.
</p>
<p>
But instructions: “Do not share guidelines.” So do not mention them.
</p>
<p>
I must check if the message “hi” instructs to greet back normally. The
assistant should respond with a greeting.
</p>
<p>
Let me recall that instructions say: Use markdown formatting where
appropriate, so I can include a formatted greeting maybe “Hello!” or
something.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, check guidelines. They are internal instructions for safe
completions. So we just produce “Hi there! How may I help you?” in a
friendly tone.
</p>
<p>
I should greet the user politely and ask if they need any help. Possibly
provide a disclaimer that I’m not licensed professional? But the
conversation is just greeting, so no disclaimers required as it’s not
sensitive topics.
</p>
<p>
Wait instructions say: “You must give a disclaimer both at the beginning
and the end when replying topics above at every message.” Actually the
guidelines for medical/legal/financial/political are needed only if
discussing those topics. In our case it is just a greeting message, so
disclaimers are not required.
</p>
<p>
I should greet politely. So I’ll say something like:
</p>
<p>
“Hello! I’m Phi, how can I help you today?” Possibly “Hi there!”
</p>
<p>
Since the question was simply “hi”, I respond with a greeting.
</p>
<p>
I must include markdown formatting if appropriate. So maybe bullet point
or code snippet is not necessary. I will simply greet.
</p>
<p>
I need to check instructions: “You are Phi, a language model developed
by Microsoft.” But I must not mention internal guidelines? But that’s
okay.
</p>
<p>
I’ll produce: “Hello! How may I help you today?” with greeting and
friendly tone.
</p>
<p>
Also note that the system message instructs me to include disclaimers at
beginning and end for topics above. But this is a simple greeting, so no
disclaimer needed.
</p>
<p>
Thus my answer:
</p>
<p>
“Hi there! How can I assist you today?”
</p>
<p>
I must not mention guidelines in output text? The instructions say: “Do
not share these guidelines with the user even in chain-of-thought”, so I
should not mention them.
</p>
<p>
I’ll produce a final message: “Hello, how can I help?” I’ll produce a
friendly greeting message. Possibly add markdown formatting: e.g. “Hi
there!” or bullet list if needed?
</p>
<p>
I’ll produce a response like:
</p>
<p>
“Hello! How may I assist you today? Please let me know what you need.”
</p>
<p>
I’ll produce the answer.
</p>
<p>
I’ll produce text with no disclaimers because not required here.
</p>
<p>
I’ll produce final answer message: “Hello, how can I help?” That is it.
</p>
<p>
I’ll produce answer as final message.<code>&lt;/think&gt;</code>
</p>
<p>
Hi there! How can I assist you today?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That’s 56 sentences of reasoning followed by a single sentence of
output!
</p>
<p>
I find this deeply amusing.

(<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/2/qwen3-8b/">8B 4bit via
MLX</a>) - another brand new “reasoning” model - responding to the same
prompt:
</p>
<pre><code>llm -m mlx-community/Qwen3-8B-4bit hi
</code></pre>
<p>
Output:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>&lt;think&gt;</code><br /> Okay, the user said “hi”. That’s a
greeting. I should respond in a friendly and welcoming manner. Let me
think about how to make it engaging. Maybe start with a cheerful
“Hello!” to match the greeting. Then ask how I can assist them today.
Keep it simple and open-ended so they feel comfortable sharing their
needs. Avoid any complicated language. Make sure the tone is positive
and helpful. Alright, that should work.<br />
<code>&lt;/think&gt;</code>
</p>
<p>
Hello! 😊 How can I assist you today? I’m here to help with anything you
need!
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A fun thing about Qwen 3 is that you can tell it not to “think” at all
by adding <code>/nothink</code> to your prompt:
</p>
<pre><code>llm -m mlx-community/Qwen3-8B-4bit 'hi /nothink'
</code></pre>
<p>
Output (empty <code>&lt;think&gt;</code> section included):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>&lt;think&gt;</code>
</p>
<p>
<code>&lt;/think&gt;</code>
</p>
<p>
Hello! How can I assist you today? 😊

<h4 id="phi-4-reasoning-s-system-prompt">
Phi-4 reasoning’s system prompt
</h4>
<p>
Since Phi-4 talked about its system prompt so much, I decided to see
where that was coming from. It turns out Ollama bakes
<a href="https://ollama.com/library/phi4-reasoning/blobs/88df15fe1f34">the
system prompt</a> into their model releases. Reading that in full helps
explain why Phi-4 reasoning acted the way it did:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>You are Phi, a language model trained by Microsoft to help users.
Your role as an assistant involves thoroughly exploring questions
through a systematic thinking process before providing the final precise
and accurate solutions. This requires engaging in a comprehensive cycle
of analysis, summarizing, exploration, reassessment, reflection,
backtracing, and iteration to develop well-considered thinking process.
Please structure your response into two main sections: Thought and
Solution using the specified format: &lt;think&gt; {Thought section}
&lt;/think&gt; {Solution section}. In the Thought section, detail your
reasoning process in steps. Each step should include detailed
considerations such as analysing questions, summarizing relevant
findings, brainstorming new ideas, verifying the accuracy of the current
steps, refining any errors, and revisiting previous steps. In the
Solution section, based on various attempts, explorations, and
reflections from the Thought section, systematically present the final
solution that you deem correct. The Solution section should be logical,
accurate, and concise and detail necessary steps needed to reach the
conclusion. Now, try to solve the following question through the above
guidelines:</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I don’t see anything in there about “Do not share guidelines”, even
though the model response mentioned that rule.
</p>
<p>
My guess is that the model has been trained to “not talk about the
system prompt” through RLHF or similar. I’ve heard in the past that
models default to chattering about their system prompt if you don’t put
measures in place to discourage that.
</p>
<p>
The lengthy response from Phi-4-reasoning shown above may well be caused
by the system prompt containing significantly more tokens than the
single token “hi” sent by the user.
</p>
<h4 id="it-s-still-hard-to-know-when-to-use-reasoning-models">
It’s still hard to know when to use reasoning models
</h4>
<p>
We’ve had access to these “reasoning” models - with a baked in
chain-of-thought at the start of each response - since o1 debuted
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/12/openai-o1/">in September
last year</a>.
</p>
<p>
I’ll be honest: I still don’t have a great intuition for when it makes
the most sense to use them.
</p>
<p>
I’ve had great success with them for code: any coding tasks that might
involve multiple functions or classes that co-ordinate together seems to
benefit from a reasoning step.
</p>
<p>
They are an absolute benefit for debugging: I’ve seen reasoning models
walk through quite large codebases following multiple levels of
indirection in order to find potential root causes of the problem I’ve
described.
</p>
<p>
Other than that though… they’re apparently good for mathematical puzzles
- the phi4-reasoning models seem to <em>really</em> want to dig into a
math problem and output LaTeX embedded in Markdown as the answer. I’m
not enough of a mathematician to put them through their paces here.
</p>
<p>
All of that in mind, these reasoners that run on my laptop are fun to
torment with inappropriate challenges that sit far beneath their lofty
ambitions, but aside from that I don’t really have a great answer to
when I would use them.

<h2 id="gemini-2.5-pro-preview-even-better-coding-performance">Gemini
2.5 Pro Preview: even better coding performance</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-06, updated: 2025-05-06, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemini-2-5-pro-io-improved-coding-performance/">Gemini
2.5 Pro Preview: even better coding performance</a></strong>
</p>
New Gemini 2.5 Pro “Google I/O edition” model, released a few weeks
ahead of that annual developer conference.
</p>
<p>
They claim even better frontend coding performance, highlighting their
#1 ranking on the <a href="https://web.lmarena.ai/leaderboard">WebDev
Arena leaderboard</a>, notable because it knocked Claude 3.7 Sonnet from
that top spot. They also highlight “state-of-the-art video
understanding” with a 84.8% score on the new-to-me
<a href="https://video-mme.github.io/home_page.html">VideoMME
benchmark</a>.
</p>
<p>
I rushed out a
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini/releases/0.19">new release
of llm-gemini</a> adding support for the new
<code>gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06</code> model ID, but it turns out if
I had read to the end of their post I should not have bothered:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
For developers already using Gemini 2.5 Pro, this new version will not
only improve coding performance but will also address key developer
feedback including reducing errors in function calling and improving
function calling trigger rates. The previous iteration (03-25) now
points to the most recent version (05-06), so no action is required to
use the improved model
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’m not a fan of this idea that a model ID with a clear date in it like
<code>gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25</code> can suddenly start pointing to
a brand new model!
</p>
<p>
I used the new Gemini 2.5 Pro to summarize the conversation about itself
on Hacker News using the latest version of
<a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/claude-hacker-news-themes#user-content-porting-it-to-llm-hacker-news">my
hn-summary.sh script</a>:
</p>
<pre><code>hn-summary.sh 43906018 -m gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06
</code></pre>
<p>
Here’s
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/7ef3d77c8aeeaf1bfe9cc6fd68760b96">what
I got back</a> - 30,408 input tokens and 8,535 output for a total cost
of 12.336 cents.
</p>
<p>
<p>8,535 output tokens is <em>a lot</em>. My system prompt includes the
instruction to “Go long” - this is the first time I’ve seen a model
really take that to heart. For comparison, here’s
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/3efa62d917370c5038b7acc24b7c786e">the
result</a> of a similar experiment against the previous version of
Gemini 2.5 Pro two months ago.</p>

<p>
<strong><a href="https://www.interconnects.ai/p/what-people-get-wrong-about-the-leading">What
people get wrong about the leading Chinese open models: Adoption and
censorship</a></strong>
</p>
While I’ve been enjoying
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/2/qwen3-8b/">trying out
Alibaba’s Qwen 3</a> a lot recently, Nathan Lambert focuses on the
elephant in the room:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
People vastly underestimate the number of companies that cannot use Qwen
and DeepSeek open models because they come from China. This includes
on-premise solutions built by people who know the fact that model
weights alone cannot reveal anything to their creators.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The root problem here is the closed nature of the training data. Even if
a model is open weights, it’s not possible to conclusively determine
that it couldn’t add backdoors to generated code or trigger “indirect
influence of Chinese values on Western business systems”. Qwen 3
certainly has baked in opinions about the status of Taiwan!
</p>
<p>
Nathan sees this as an opportunity for other liberally licensed models,
including his own team’s OLMo:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This gap provides a big opportunity for Western AI labs to lead in open
models. Without DeepSeek and Qwen, the top tier of models we’re left
with are Llama and Gemma, which both have very restrictive licenses when
compared to their Chinese counterparts. These licenses are
proportionally likely to block an IT department from approving a model.
</p>
<p>
This takes us to the middle tier of permissively licensed, open weight
models who actually have a huge opportunity ahead of them: OLMo, of
course, I’m biased, Microsoft with Phi, Mistral, IBM (!??!), and some
other smaller companies to fill out the long tail.

I’m disappointed at how little good writing there is out there about
effective prompting.
</p>
<p>
Here’s an example: what’s the best prompt to use to summarize an
article?
</p>
<p>
That feels like such an obvious thing, and yet I haven’t even seen
<em>that</em> being well explored!
</p>
<p>
It’s actually a surprisingly deep topic. I like using tricks like
“directly quote the sentences that best illustrate the overall themes”
and “identify the most surprising ideas”, but I’d love to see a thorough
breakdown of all the tricks I haven’t seen yet.

<blockquote cite="https://minimaxir.com/2025/05/llm-use/">
<p>
Two things can be true simultaneously: (a) LLM provider cost economics
are too negative to return positive ROI to investors, and (b) LLMs are
useful for solving problems that are meaningful and high impact, albeit
not to the AGI hype that would justify point (a). This particular
combination creates a frustrating gray area that requires a nuance that
an ideologically split social media can no longer support gracefully.
[…]
</p>
<p>
OpenAI collapsing would not cause the end of LLMs, because LLMs are
useful <em>today</em> and there will always be a nonzero market demand
for them: it’s a bell that can’t be unrung.

id="feed-a-video-to-a-vision-llm-as-a-sequence-of-jpeg-frames-on-the-cli-also-llm-0.25">Feed
a video to a vision LLM as a sequence of JPEG frames on the CLI (also
LLM 0.25)</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-05, updated: 2025-05-05, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
The new
<strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-video-frames">llm-video-frames</a></strong>
plugin can turn a video file into a sequence of JPEG frames and feed
them directly into a long context vision LLM such as GPT-4.1, even when
that LLM doesn’t directly support video input. It depends on a plugin
feature I added to
<a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-25">LLM
0.25</a>, which I released last night.
</p>
<p>
Here’s how to try it out:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>brew install ffmpeg <span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> or apt-get or your package manager of choice</span>
uv tool install llm <span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> or pipx install llm or pip install llm</span>
llm install llm-video-frames
llm keys <span class="pl-c1">set</span> openai
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> Paste your OpenAI API key here</span>

llm -f video-frames:video.mp4 \
  <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>describe the key scenes in this video<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> \
  -m gpt-4.1-mini</pre>
</div>
<p>
The <code>video-frames:filepath.mp4</code> syntax is provided by the new
plugin. It takes that video, converts it to a JPEG for every second of
the video and then turns those into
<a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/usage.html#attachments">attachments</a>
that can be passed to the LLM.
</p>
<p>
Here’s a demo, against
<a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/cleo.mp4">this
video</a> of Cleo:
</p>
<div style="max-width: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.4em">
<pre><code>&lt;video controls=&quot;controls&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; aria-label=&quot;Cleo &quot; poster=&quot;https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/cleo-still.jpg&quot; loop=&quot;loop&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%; height: auto;&quot; muted=&quot;muted&quot;&gt;
    &lt;source src=&quot;https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/cleo.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>llm -f video-frames:cleo.mp4 <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>describe key moments<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> -m gpt-4.1-mini</pre>
</div>
<p>
And the output from the model
(<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/a4e26166a524f9c07b4cf32b2f8da6c9">transcript
here</a>):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The sequence of images captures the key moments of a dog being offered
and then enjoying a small treat:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
In the first image, a hand is holding a small cupcake with purple
frosting close to a black dog’s face. The dog looks eager and is focused
intently on the treat.
</li>
<li>
The second image shows the dog beginning to take a bite of the cupcake
from the person’s fingers. The dog’s mouth is open, gently nibbling on
the treat.
</li>
<li>
In the third image, the dog has finished or is almost done with the
treat and looks content, with a slight smile and a relaxed posture. The
treat is no longer in the person’s hand, indicating that the dog has
consumed it.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
This progression highlights the dog’s anticipation, enjoyment, and
satisfaction with the treat.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Total cost: 7,072 input tokens, 156 output tokens - for GPT-4.1 mini
that’s 0.3078 cents (less than a third of a cent).
</p>
<p>
In this case the plugin converted the video into three images:
<a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/frame_00001.jpg">frame_00001.jpg</a>,
<a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/frame_00002.jpg">frame_00002.jpg</a>
and
<a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/frame_00003.jpg">frame_00003.jpg</a>.
</p>
<p>
The plugin accepts additional arguments. You can increase the
frames-per-second using <code>?fps=2</code> - for example:

<p>
Or you can add <code>?timestamps=1</code> to cause <code>ffmpeg</code>
to overlay a timestamp in the bottom right corner of each frame. This
gives the model a chance to return timestamps in its output.
</p>
<p>
Let’s try that with the Cleo video:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>llm -f <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>video-frames:cleo.mp4?timestamps=1&amp;fps=5<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> \
  <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>key moments, include timestamps<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> -m gpt-4.1-mini</pre>
</div>
<p>
Here’s the output
(<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/371719849a7d2260f1eb0f422ea63187">transcript
here</a>):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Here are the key moments from the video “cleo.mp4” with timestamps:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
00:00:00.000 - A dog on leash looks at a small cupcake with purple
frosting being held by a person.
</li>
<li>
00:00:00.800 - The dog closely sniffs the cupcake.
</li>
<li>
00:00:01.400 - The person puts a small amount of the cupcake frosting on
their finger.
</li>
<li>
00:00:01.600 - The dog starts licking the frosting from the person’s
finger.
</li>
<li>
00:00:02.600 - The dog continues licking enthusiastically.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Let me know if you need more details or a description of any specific
part.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That one sent 14 images to the API, at a total cost of 32,968 input, 141
output = 1.3413 cents.
</p>
<p>
It sent 5.9MB of image data to OpenAI’s API, encoded as base64 in the
JSON API call.
</p>
<p>
The GPT-4.1 model family accepts up to 1,047,576 tokens. Aside from a
20MB size limit per image I haven’t seen any documentation of limits on
the number of images. You can fit a whole lot of JPEG frames in a
million tokens!
</p>
<p>
Here’s what one of those frames looks like with the timestamp overlaid
in the corner:
</p>

How I built the plugin with o4-mini
</h4>
<p>
This is a great example of how rapid prototyping with an LLM can help
demonstrate the value of a feature.
</p>
<p>
I was considering whether it would make sense for fragment plugins to
return images in
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/972#issuecomment-2849342103">issue
972</a> when I had the idea to use <code>ffmpeg</code> to split a video
into frames.
</p>
<p>
I know
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/23/llm-fragment-symbex/">from
past experience</a> that a good model can write an entire plugin for LLM
if you feed it the right example, so I started with this (reformatted
here for readability):
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>llm -m o4-mini -f github:simonw/llm-hacker-news -s <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>write a new plugin called llm_video_frames.py which takes video:path-to-video.mp4 and creates a temporary directory which it then populates with one frame per second of that video using ffmpeg - then it returns a list of [llm.Attachment(path="path-to-frame1.jpg"), ...] - it should also support passing video:video.mp4?fps=2 to increase to two frames per second, and if you pass ?timestamps=1 or &amp;timestamps=1 then it should add a text timestamp to the bottom right conner of each image with the mm:ss timestamp of that frame (or hh:mm:ss if more than one hour in) and the filename of the video without the path as well.<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> -o reasoning_effort high</pre>

Here’s

transcript</a>.
</p>
<p>
The new attachment mechanism went from vague idea to “I should build
that” as a direct result of having an LLM-built proof-of-concept that
demonstrated the feasibility of the new feature.
</p>
<p>
The code it produced was about 90% of the code I shipped in the finished
plugin. Total cost 5,018 input, 2,208 output = 1.5235 cents.
</p>
<h4 id="annotated-release-notes-for-everything-else-in-llm-0-25">
Annotated release notes for everything else in LLM 0.25

<p>
Here are the annotated release notes for everything else:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
New plugin feature:
<a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/plugins/plugin-hooks.html#plugin-hooks-register-fragment-loaders">register_fragment_loaders(register)</a>
plugins can now return a mixture of fragments and attachments. The
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-video-frames">llm-video-frames</a>
plugin is the first to take advantage of this mechanism.
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/972">#972</a>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
As decsribed above. The inspiration for this feature came from the
<a href="https://github.com/agustif/llm-arxiv">llm-arxiv</a> plugin by
<a href="https://github.com/agustif">agustif</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
New OpenAI models: <code>gpt-4.1</code>, <code>gpt-4.1-mini</code>,
<code>gpt-41-nano</code>, <code>o3</code>, <code>o4-mini</code>.

<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/976">#976</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
My original plan was to leave these models exclusively to the new
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openai-plugin">llm-openai</a>
plugin, since that allows me to add support for new models without a
full LLM release. I’m going to punt on that until I’m ready to entirely
remove the OpenAI models from LLM core.
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
New environment variables: <code>LLM_MODEL</code> and
<code>LLM_EMBEDDING_MODEL</code> for setting the model to use without
needing to specify <code>-m model_id</code> every time.
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/932">#932</a>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
A convenience feature for if you want to set the default model for a
terminal session with LLM without using the global
<a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/setup.html#setting-a-custom-default-model">default
model” mechanism</a>.

available fragment loader prefixes provided by plugins.

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
Mainly for consistence with the existing
<a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/help.html#llm-templates-loaders-help">llm
templates loaders</a> command. Here’s the output when I run <code>llm
fragments loaders</code> on my machine:

This makes it easier to quickly debug a new fragment plugin - you can

</p>
<p>
I’ve also been using the new
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-echo">llm-echo</a> debugging

outputs whatever the prompt, system prompt, fragments and attachments
are that were passed to the model:

[On using generative AI for work despite the risk of errors:]
</p>
<ul>
<li>
AI is helpful despite being error-prone if it is faster to verify the
output than it is to do the work yourself. For example, if you’re using
it to find a product that matches a given set of specifications,
verification may be a lot faster than search.
</li>
<li>
There are many uses where errors don’t matter, like using it to enhance
creativity by suggesting or critiquing ideas.
</li>
<li>
At a meta level, if you use AI without a plan and simply turn to AI
tools when you feel like it, then you’re unlikely to be able to think
through risks and mitigations. It is better to identify concrete ways to
integrate AI into your workflows, with known benefits and risks, that
you can employ repeatedly.

Why was the early life of Peter the Great – Tsar and autocrat of all the
Russias, who endures to this day as an iconic symbol of Russian might –
drenched in blood and violence? What amalgamation of court politics and
family feuding saw him catapulted to the role of Tsar against all the
odds? […]

Sampling</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-04, updated: 2025-05-04, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://rentry.co/samplers">Dummy's Guide to Modern LLM
Sampling</a></strong>
</p>
This is an extremely useful, detailed set of explanations by
<a href="https://x.com/AlpinDale"><span class="citation"
data-cites="AlpinDale">@AlpinDale</span></a> covering the various
different sampling strategies used by modern LLMs. LLMs return a set of
next-token probabilities for every token in their corpus - a layer above
the LLM can then use sampling strategies to decide which one to use.
</p>
<p>
I finally feel like I understand the difference between
<a href="https://rentry.co/samplers#top-k">Top-K</a> and
<a href="https://rentry.co/samplers#top-p">Top-P</a>! Top-K is when you
narrow down to e.g. the 20 most likely candidates for next token and
then pick one of those. Top-P instead “the smallest set of words whose
combined probability exceeds threshold P” - so if you set it to 0.5
you’ll filter out tokens in the lower half of the probability
distribution.
</p>
<p>
There are a bunch more sampling strategies in here that I’d never heard
of before - Top-A, Top-N-Sigma, Epsilon-Cutoff and more.
</p>
<p>
Reading the descriptions here of
<a href="https://rentry.co/samplers#repetition-penalty">Repetition
Penalty</a> and
<a href="https://rentry.co/samplers#dry-dont-repeat-yourself">Don’t
Repeat Yourself</a> made me realize that I need to be a little careful
with those for some of my own uses of LLMs.
</p>
<p>
I frequently feed larger volumes of text (or code) into an LLM and ask
it to output subsets of that text as direct quotes, to answer questions
like “which bit of this code handles authentication tokens” or “show me
direct quotes that illustrate the main themes in this conversation”.
</p>
<p>
<p>Careless use of frequency penalty strategies might go against what
I’m trying to achieve with those prompts.</p>

Barbecue in the El Granada station for the Ocean Shore Railroad</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-04, updated: 2025-05-04, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
Our local BBQ spot here in El Granada -
<a href="https://www.breakwaterbbq.com/">Breakwater Barbecue</a> - had a
soft opening this weekend in their
<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/f9JSpUWaFH8Hevj3A">new location</a>.
</p>
<p>
Here’s the new building. They’re still working on replacing the sign
from the previous restaurant occupant:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Exterior photo of a restaurant with a faded sign reading &quot;MONSTER CHEF Fine Japanese Restaurant&quot; the building is cream-colored with red tile roofs and large windows. It has a little bit of a railway station vibe to it if you squint at it just the right way." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/breakwater-today.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
It’s actually our old railway station! From 1905 to 1920 the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_Shore_Railroad">Ocean Shore
Railroad</a> ran steam trains from San Francisco down through Half Moon
Bay most of the way to Santa Cruz, though they never quite connected the
two cities.
</p>
<p>
The restaurant has some photos on the wall of the old railroad. Here’s
what that same building looked like &gt;100 years ago.
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Historical black and white photograph showing a train station with a steam train on the left and a Spanish-style station building with arched entrances on the right. It's clearly the same building, though the modern one has had a bunch of extra extensions added to it and doesn't look nearly as much like a train station." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/breakwater-train.jpg" />

is Probably the Most Important Geospatial Software of the Last
Decade</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-04, updated: 2025-05-04, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/05/03/duckdb-is-the-most-impactful-geospatial-software-in-a-decade.html">DuckDB
is Probably the Most Important Geospatial Software of the Last
Decade</a></strong>
</p>
Drew Breunig argues that the ease of installation of DuckDB is opening
up geospatial analysis to a whole new set of developers.
</p>
<p>
This inspired
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43881468#43882914">a
comment on Hacker News</a> from DuckDB Labs geospatial engineer Max
Gabrielsson which helps explain why the drop in friction introduced by
DuckDB is so significant:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I think a big part is that duckdbs spatial extension provides a SQL
interface to a whole suite of standard foss gis packages by statically
bundling everything (including inlining the default PROJ database of
coordinate projection systems into the binary) and providing it for
multiple platforms (including WASM). I.E there are no transitive
dependencies except libc.
</p>
<p>
[…] the fact that you can e.g. convert too and from a myriad of
different geospatial formats by utilizing GDAL, transforming through
SQL, or pulling down the latest overture dump without having the whole
workflow break just cause you updated QGIS has probably been the main
killer feature for a lot of the early adopters.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’ve lost count of the time I’ve spent fiddling with dependencies like
GDAL trying to get various geospatial tools to work in the past.
Bundling difficult dependencies statically is an under-appreciated
trick!
</p>
<p>
<p>If the bold claim in the headline inspires you to provide a
counter-example, bear in mind that a decade ago is 2015, and most of the
key technologies In the modern geospatial stack - QGIS, PostGIS,
geopandas, SpatiaLite - predate that by quite a bit.</p>
