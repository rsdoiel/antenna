Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0743 AM CDT Tue Jul 08 2025

Valid 081300Z - 091200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
MID-ATLANTIC STATES...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are expected across the Mid-Atlantic
states. More isolated severe storms are expected across portions of
the Plains into the Mid Mississippi Valley.

...Mid-Atlantic States...
A relatively active thunderstorm day is expected this afternoon into
evening regionally. In association with semi-amplified westerlies
centered over the Midwest/Great Lakes, a weak mid-level disturbance
or two will likely influence the region later today. This will be in
conjunction with a moist airmass, with moderately strong buoyancy
developing by late morning given ample insolation east of the
Appalachians. A modest enhancement to the westerlies aloft may
contribute to as much as 25 kt effective shear, supportive of
sustained clusters and linear segments. Steep low-level lapse rates
and high-water content suggests damaging downbursts are likely,
especially with any organized clusters this afternoon through around
mid-evening. This most favored corridor for downbursts/tree damage
is expected to focus east of the Blue Ridge across eastern portions
of Virginia/Maryland into southeast Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

...Plains to Middle Mississippi Valley...
Severe storms will again be possible today on the eastern periphery
of the Southwest/Four Corners-centered upper ridge. Several
low-amplitude disturbances will pivot the ridge coincident with
modestly enhanced north-northwesterly flow aloft across the High
Plains, while a decayed MCS and residual MCV/outflow will influence
renewed diurnal deep convective development across the Ozarks and
middle Mississippi Valley later today. Sporadic bouts of damaging
winds can be expected, with large hail potential more focused across
the High Plains, and in particular the north-central High Plains
where a Slight Risk could be warranted pending
guidance/observational trends later this morning.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0317 AM CDT Tue Jul 08 2025

Valid 111200Z - 161200Z

...DISCUSSION...
The overall current large-scale pattern will persist through this
forecast period, albeit with minor day-to-day variations. More
specifically, a mid-level ridge will persist across the western US,
although its center will meander from the Southwest US to off the
coast of California and back; a series of shortwave troughs of
varying intensity will quickly move across the northern Plains; and
a very warm, moist environment will remain entrenched across the
eastern US. 

This overall pattern suggests episodic bouts of severe thunderstorms
on any given day. However, the timing and location of specific
episodes will be tied to mesoscale details and impacts from prior
days' convection which have low predictability on time scales of
this forecast period. As such, low confidence in the details of
required to identify any of these severe events currently precludes
any probabilistic delineation at this time.

That said, there are a couple of scenarios being monitored for
potential future highlights. The first is the potential for severe
storms across the southern Plains on Saturday or Sunday associated
with a residual boundary/front. However, impacts from a potential
overnight mesoscale convective system moving from the High Plains
into the Southern Plains on Friday night into Saturday lead to
little confidence in the placement of any boundaries and the
resulting severe potential. 

Another potential is for severe convection across northern Minnesota
and the Upper Great Lakes early next week associated with a stronger
shortwave trough moving through southern Canada. However, guidance
continues to show high variance regarding the strength of moisture
return, degree of instability, and timing of the shortwave itself to
preclude unconditional severe probabilities at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 1595
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0328 PM CDT Mon Jul 07 2025

Areas affected...south-central Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 072028Z - 072200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated storms capable of large hail/damaging winds
expected to to continue. Watch issuance is possible but remains
uncertain in the short term.

DISCUSSION...Visible satellite/radar shows a few isolated storms
that have developed during peak heating amid a very unstable
airmass, characterized by MLCAPE values nearing 3000 J/kg. Deep
layer shear has remained somewhat marginal thus far, perhaps
approaching 30-35 kt, but is forecast to increase with time. Thus,
storms should exhibit supercell characteristics, with large hail and
damaging winds the primary threats. Southeasterly low-level flow is
promoting at least some elongation of hodographs, but low-level
shear remains weak in general. Thus, the tornado threat appears low
but cannot be ruled out. These storms are expected to remain
isolated, and thus, watch issuance is not anticipated in the short
term. However, convective trends will be monitored should a watch be
needed for the region.

Mesoscale Discussion 1594
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0303 PM CDT Mon Jul 07 2025

Areas affected...Far northeast New York...northern Vermont and New
Hampshire...and into central Maine

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 072003Z - 072200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong thunderstorms may pose a severe wind/hail
risk through the afternoon and early evening hours. This threat is
expected to remain sufficiently isolated to preclude watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...Latest regional radar imagery shows a gradual
maturation of convection across far northeast NY and across central
ME along/ahead of a cold front. Temperatures warming into the low
80s with dewpoints in the upper 60s to low 70s is slowly eroding
inhibition with MLCAPE increasing to around 500-1000 J/kg region
wide. This warming trend should continue and will promote further
thunderstorm intensification over the next couple of hours. 30-40
knot mid-level winds in proximity to a weakening upper trough are
supporting sufficient hodograph elongation for organized convection.
While convective mode will likely transition to predominantly a
semi-organized convective band due to strong flow along the
initiating cold front, an initial supercell or two appears possible
and may pose a severe hail/wind risk through the afternoon -
especially across central ME where forcing for ascent is currently
more nebulous. With time, strong to severe winds should become the
predominant hazard as a band of storms begins to emerge. Despite
these concerns, the overall severe threat is expected to remain
sufficiently isolated to preclude watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1593
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0255 PM CDT Mon Jul 07 2025

Areas affected...eastern North Dakota and northwest Minnesota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 071955Z - 072200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Large hail, damaging winds, and perhaps a tornado are
possible this afternoon/evening. Watch issuance is possible.

DISCUSSION...Regional satellite/radar show convection developing
along a cold front positioned from northeast North Dakota extending
southwestward, and along a warm front extending into northeast
Minnesota. This activity is developing in a region where skies have
remained clear in proximity to passing cirrus clouds to the
immediate south. In addition, cool mid-level temperatures are
overspreading the region, in association with an upper-level trough.
These factors are contributing to destabilization that is yielding
MLCAPE values near 1500 J/kg. Ample effective shear of 40-45 kt is
also present, associated with the aforementioned trough.

Storms are expected to continue increasing in coverage and severity
throughout the afternoon and into the evening. Large hail and
damaging wind gusts will be the primary threats. A tornado will also
be possible with any storm that can favorably interact with
aforementioned warm front. Coverage of storms remains uncertain in
the short term, given the extent of the cirrus shield limiting
destabilization. However, at least some CAM solutions suggest
greater coverage may materialize. Thus, convective trends will be
monitored for possible watch issuance this afternoon/evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 1592
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0223 PM CDT Mon Jul 07 2025

Areas affected...northeast Colorado...far southeast
Wyoming...southwest Nebraska...and northwest Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 071923Z - 072130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered severe storms expected by mid/late afternoon,
posing a threat for severe wind/hail. Watch possible.

DISCUSSION...Visible satellite show a broad area of terrain
generated convection over the mountains of central/northern Colorado
into far southeast Wyoming. Additional convection is now forming
downstream of this activity, along the lee of the Rockies. Clear
skies have promoted strong insolation amid a relatively moist
low-level airmass for the central High Plains, with dew point
temperatures in the mid/upper 50s F. This is contributing to an
west-to-east instability gradient, with MLCAPE values approaching
1500 J/kg in far northeast Colorado. Surface observations also
indicate a weak upslope flow regime in this region in advance of a
stalling cold front across the panhandle of Nebraska.

The aforementioned convection should continue to develop and
propagate eastward off the high terrain with time. As this occurs,
storms will encounter greater instability as MLCAPE values are
forecast to approach 2000-2500 J/kg. Effective shear is forecast to
increase throughout the afternoon/evening, approaching 35-45 kt.
This will help to promote storm organization into
supercell/multicell modes, with damaging winds and severe hail
expected. With time, cold pools may promote upscale growth into an
MCS this evening, transitioning into more of a damaging wind threat.
Given this potential, the area is being monitored for possible watch
issuance this afternoon.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0258 PM CDT Mon Jul 07 2025

Valid 072000Z - 081200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PORTIONS
OF NORTHEAST COLORADO INTO NEBRASKA AND SOUTH DAKOTA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe storms are likely across the central into northern
Plains. Severe wind gusts and large hail are the main threats.
Isolated damaging winds are also possible across parts of the Lower
Great Lakes, Ohio/Tennessee River Valleys, and the Northeast.

...20z Update Northern Plains...
The prior forecast remains largely on track this afternoon with only
minor adjustments. The northern portions of the Level 3 ENH area
were trimmed for trends with ongoing convection. Surging outflow has
cooled surface temperatures into the low 70s across northeastern SD
and west-central MN. As the outflow continues to move south, this
should focus storm development and severe potential along the
boundary. Supercells and organized clusters are still expected
across parts of eastern SD into northern NE this afternoon/evening.
Hail and damaging gusts are likely, along with an isolated tornado
or two.

Upscale growth into an organized cluster/MCS is likely this evening.
Damaging wind gusts will be the primary risk later this evening and
into the overnight hours. While confidence in the eastern extent of
the severe risk is low, recent CAM guidance suggests some damaging
wind threat may extended farther east into portions of central IA.
Have adjusted the level 1 MRGL for this potential.

...Central High Plains...
Storm initiation is underway within a broad upslope flow regime
across western SD and eastern WY/CO. Scattered storms, including a
few supercells appear likely. Moderate buoyancy/steep mid-level
lapse rates and 30-40 kt of deep-layer shear will favor a risk for
damaging wind gusts and hail. Consolidation into one or more
clusters is likely tonight, with a continued threat for damaging
winds. See MCD#1592 for additional short-term info.

...OH Valley/Northeast...
Scattered to numerous thunderstorms are ongoing from the central US
to the OH Valley and into the Northeast. Amid weak vertical shear
pulse multi-cell storms with occasional damaging gusts will remain
likely into this evening. The severe risk will be largely diurnal
with a decreasing risk after dark. Have adjusted the severe risk for
current frontal/storm position slightly farther east.

..Lyons.. 07/07/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1124 AM CDT Mon Jul 07 2025/

...SD/NE/KS/CO...
A complex evolution of convection is expected this afternoon and
evening across the central Plains.  One line/cluster of
thunderstorms is expected to develop from the showers across SD. 
Continued daytime heating will eventually lead to intensification
and organization of storms building southeastward into NE and
western IA.  These storms will pose a risk of large hail and
damaging winds.

Farther southwest, storms are expected to develop and spread
eastward across southeast WY and northeast CO (similar to yesterday)
and eventually track into western NE/KS.  These storms will also
pose risk of damaging winds and hail through the early evening.

It appears likely that these two convective regimes will congeal
during the evening, with more of a southward push into KS and
eventually northern OK late tonight, although the severe risk by
that time is uncertain.

...OH to ME...
A warm/humid air mass is present today from OH northeastward across
parts of NY/PA and northern New England.  Widely scattered afternoon
thunderstorms are expected along this entire corridor.  Strong
daytime heating will result in steep low-level lapse rates, with
sufficient mid-level westerly flow to aid in gusty/damaging wind
gusts.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0258 PM CDT Mon Jul 07 2025

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...Northwest and Great Basin...
An approaching mid-level trough and associated increasing mid-level
west winds will introduce elevated fire weather conditions into the
Columbia Gorge/Basin and adjacent leeward slopes of the Cascades
Tuesday. A mid-level low off the coast of northern CA will provide
supportive dynamics for isolated thunderstorms across central OR.
Limited precipitation with these thunderstorms will increase fire
ignition potential amid receptive fuels primarily across the higher
terrain of central and east-central OR. Elevated fire weather
conditions atop dry fuels are still expected across much of central
and eastern NV and far western UT where southwest winds of 10-20 mph
and relative humidity in the 10-15% range will be collocated.

..Williams.. 07/07/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0200 AM CDT Mon Jul 07 2025/

...Synopsis...
A midlevel low will gradually approach the northern CA coast as it
loosely phases with a stronger midlevel trough moving eastward
across British Columbia on Tuesday. Large-scale ascent preceding the
midlevel low will aid in isolated thunderstorm development along the
higher terrain of central OR. Around 0.7 inch PW and a deeply mixed
boundary layer will favor dry thunderstorms, with an associated risk
of lightning-induced ignitions and strong/erratic outflow winds. At
the same time, a belt of moderate-strong midlevel winds peripheral
to the trough in British Columbia will cross the Cascades. This will
promote dry/breezy downslope winds in the Columbia Basin, with the
strongest winds expected through the Cascade Gaps. Given
dry/receptive fuels, elevated fire-weather conditions are expected.

Farther south, moderate deep-layer southwesterly flow ahead of the
midlevel low will overspread a well-mixed boundary layer across
parts of central/southern NV, where elevated to locally critical
fire-weather conditions are expected.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0213 PM CDT Mon Jul 07 2025

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE
NORTHERN PLAINS...AND OVER PARTS OF THE APPALACHIANS AND MID
ATLANTIC REGION...

...SUMMARY...
At least isolated severe storms are possible in the northern Plains
on Wednesday, with locally large hail and areas of severe gusts.
Isolated damaging gusts are also possible across parts of the
eastern U.S.

...Northern Plains...
An upper high will remain over the Four Corners states on Wednesday,
with ridge extending northward into MT. This ridge will break down
late in the day as a large trough sweeps along the Canadian border,
and a separate smaller shortwave moves across the Great Basin. 

During the day, a surface trough will deepen over the northern to
central High Plains, with southerly surface winds maintaining a
plume of 60s F dewpoints. Strong heating will occur beneath the
initial ridge, resulting in an uncapped air mass. Storms will form
near this trough from the central Dakotas into western NE, with
widely scattered storms traveling southeastward and producing
localized corridors of large hail and damaging gusts. A significant
hail storm may occur as upper-level winds increase, elongating
hodographs beneath the steep-lapse rates aloft.

...VA...MD...DE...Carolinas...
An upper trough will continue eastward across eastern Ontario and
into Quebec, with modest southwest winds of 30 kt at 500 mb as far
south as VA. In contrast to the previous day, lapse rates and
instability are not forecast to be as strong, due to lingering
clouds and perhaps areas of outflow from early day rain. However,
the air mass will again destabilize, with modest instability
developing. Storms will form over the higher terrain during the
later afternoon, with areas of strong outflow pushing east through
evening.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1225 PM CDT Mon Jul 07 2025

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF THE
MID ATLANTIC...AND OVER A PORTION OF THE SOUTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe storms capable of damaging gusts are most
probable over parts of the Mid Atlantic, and over much of Oklahoma.

...Parts of the central/southern Plains to the mid MS Valley...
A weak northwest flow pattern will exist over the central and
southern Plains on Tuesday, around an upper high over the Four
Corners region. Of note are relatively cool midlevel temperatures
for this time of year, with -8 to -10 C at 500 mb from OK into KS.

At the surface, a boundary will stretch from parts of northern MO
into southern KS, possibly enhanced by areas of early convection.
Strong heating and a very moist air mass will lead to strong
destabilization, especially across KS, OK, MO and northern TX. While
model solutions do vary with timing of redevelopment along this
boundary, the overarching theme is for one or more clusters of
storms to form late in the day, with a southward propagation. Given
substantial instability and precipitable water content, areas of
severe wind gusts appear likely with any MCS. Depending on how
organized such an MCS becomes, it could potentially reach northern
TX by 12Z Wednesday with wind potential.

...Mid Atlantic...
An upper trough will move across the Great Lakes region Tuesday,
with peripheral effects across parts of the area. A surface trough
will deepen during the day along the I-95 corridor, where a very
moist and unstable air mass will exist due to 70s F dewpoints and
strong heating.

Forecast soundings indicate tall, moist CAPE profiles with MUCAPE of
2000-3000 J/kg and precipitable water values over 2.00 inches. This
should foster robust storms with heavy water loading and severe
downdraft potential.

Storms should form by early afternoon over eastern WV/western and
northern VA, with an upward trend in coverage and intensity across
southeast PA, northern and central VA, MD, DE and NJ. Strong to
severe wind gusts appear likely with these storms, especially as
outflows merge after about 21Z.

1149 AM CDT Mon Jul 07 2025

Valid 071700Z - 081200Z

...Central Nevada...
Increasing mid-level flow on the southeastern periphery of a cut off
low off the northern CA coast will overspread portions of the Great
Basin today. A very dry boundary layer with single digit relative
humidity and sustained south/southwest winds of around 15 mph will
support elevated fire weather conditions over portions of central
Nevada this afternoon. Otherwise, previous forecast (see below) for
isolated dry thunderstorms across far northern CA into south-central
OR remains consistent with latest short term model guidance.

..Williams.. 07/07/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0158 AM CDT Mon Jul 07 2025/

...Synopsis...
A midlevel low off the northern/central CA coast will move slowly
northward through the period. Related midlevel ascent will
overspread northern CA into southern OR, aiding in the development
of isolated high-based thunderstorms over the higher terrain during
the afternoon. Deep inverted-V soundings with 0.5-0.75 inch PW will
favor dry thunderstorms, with an associated risk of
lightning-induced ignitions and gusty outflow winds atop receptive
fuels. 

Farther south, enhanced southerly flow peripheral to the midlevel
low will overspread a well-mixed boundary layer across the Great
Basin. This will promote locally dry/breezy conditions, with locally
elevated fire-weather conditions possible over parts of
central/southern NV during the afternoon.

Continued daytime heating will eventually lead to intensification
and organization of storms building southeastward into NE and
western IA.  These storms will pose a risk of large hail and
damaging winds.

Farther southwest, storms are expected to develop and spread
eastward across southeast WY and northeast CO (similar to yesterday)
and eventually track into western NE/KS.  These storms will also
pose risk of damaging winds and hail through the early evening.

It appears likely that these two convective regimes will congeal
during the evening, with more of a southward push into KS and
eventually northern OK late tonight, although the severe risk by
that time is uncertain.

...OH to ME...
A warm/humid air mass is present today from OH northeastward across
parts of NY/PA and northern New England.  Widely scattered afternoon
thunderstorms are expected along this entire corridor.  Strong
daytime heating will result in steep low-level lapse rates, with
sufficient mid-level westerly flow to aid in gusty/damaging wind
gusts.

0344 PM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025

Areas affected...north-central North Carolina into far southern
Virginia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 062044Z - 062215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A brief tornado or strong wind gust will remain possible
with the convection near the remnant core of TD Chantal.

DISCUSSION...Afternoon imagery shows the remnants of TD Chantal
located across portions of north-central NC near 34.4 deg N 79.2 deg
W. Within the broader precip shield, a few deeper convective towers
have remained strong with occasional cyclonic rotation observed.
Enhanced low-level shear (0-1km SRH near 200 m2/s2) near the remnant
center will remain strong enough to support occasional low-level
mesocyclones with this convection. Despite weak buoyancy (MLCAPE
(~500 J/kg) the moist surface environment and some deeper storms may
remain capable of a brief tornado two and damaging gust into this
evening. Widespread severe weather is not anticipated, and the
interaction of the circulation with higher terrain to the west
should slowly limit the threat tonight.

0326 PM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025

Areas affected...portions of northern Maine

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 062026Z - 062200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated to widely scattered thunderstorms, including a
few supercells, may pose a risk for damaging gusts and small hail
this afternoon/evening. A WW is unlikely.

DISCUSSION...As of 2020 UTC, regional radar and satellite imagery
showed convection was strengthening across portions of Maine. As
temperatures have warmed into the upper 70s to low 80s, around 1000
J/kg of MLCAPE has developed with dewpoints in the 60s. While not
overly strong, this buoyancy should continue to support occasional
stronger updrafts with convection across the region. Deep-layer
shear is supportive of storm organization with the KCBW VAD showing
an elongated hodograph and 30-45 kt of bulk shear. Weak mid-level
rotation has already been observed and the environment suggests a
few supercell/organized multi cell structures are possible. With
poor lapse rates and relatively limited buoyancy, damaging gusts
still appear to be the primary risk. However, some small hail and a
brief tornado are possible with the stronger rotating storms.

HRRR guidance and observations suggests additional storm
development/intensification is plausible this afternoon with more
storms developing/moving in from eastern Canada this evening. While
some severe risk is possible, confidence in severe coverage is low
owing to weak forcing and limited buoyancy. Convective trends are
being monitored, but a WW is currently unlikely.

Areas affected...Eastern New Mexico

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 061918Z - 062145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms emanating off the southern Rockies will pose
an isolated severe wind/hail threat through the late afternoon and
early evening hours. Watch issuance is not expected.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm development within the Sangre de Cristo
and Sacramento mountains is evident in recent GOES imagery. Weak
mid-level flow over the region will likely result in slow storm
propagation off the higher terrain, but as this occurs storms will
eventually move into an unseasonably moist air mass downstream
(dewpoint values in the 75th-90th percentile for early July). This
moisture is contributing to around 1000-1500 J/kg MLCAPE that should
promote thunderstorm maintenance, and possibly intensification,
through late evening. A combination of semi-discrete cells and
propagating clusters is expected with an attendant threat for
isolated large hail (most likely near/below 1.25 inch in diameter)
and sporadic severe wind gusts. The overall severe threat is
expected to remain relatively isolated given the modest kinematic
environment, which should preclude the need for watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1578
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0138 PM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025

Areas affected...Northeast Colorado to southeast Wyoming and western
Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 061838Z - 062115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms developing within the higher terrain of the
central Rockies will spread east and intensify through the
afternoon. As this occurs, the threat for severe winds, and possibly
large hail, will increase. Watch issuance is probable later this
afternoon as thunderstorms increase in coverage and intensity.

DISCUSSION...Latest GOES imagery and lightning data shows a gradual
uptick in convection within the higher terrain of central to
northern CO and far southern WY as daytime heating drives increasing
orographic ascent within a weakly capped air mass. This initial
activity is expected to spread east into the High Plains over the
coming hours given 30-40 knot westerly flow within the CAPE-bearing
layer. Storm intensification is expected as convection overspreads a
relatively moist low-level air mass (dewpoints remain in the mid to
upper 50s downstream) and as lingering inhibition is removed via
deepening boundary-layer heating/mixing. 

Across southeast WY and western NE, slightly stronger zonal flow
aloft coupled with weak easterly low-level winds should promote
adequate deep-layer shear for a couple of supercells with an
attendant large hail risk (possibly up to 2 inches in diameter). The
tornado threat may also be locally greatest across this region due
to augmented low-level shear/SRH on the immediate cool side of a
residual outflow boundary emanating out of central NE.

Further south across CO, observed dewpoint depressions and
short-term forecast soundings suggest LCL heights should approach
2.5 to 3 km as temperatures warm into the upper 80s, which will
promote strong downdraft evaporative cooling and accelerations as
well as rapid cold pool production. Strong to severe downburst winds
and sporadic large hail appear likely within initially discrete
cells moving off the terrain and/or developing within the DCVZ, but
upscale growth into organized clusters is anticipated later this
afternoon/evening with a more widespread severe wind risk (with
gusts possibly as high as 70-80 mph). Watch issuance is probable as
these threats begin to emerge in the coming hours.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 489
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
120 PM MDT Sun Jul 6 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northeast Colorado
  Nebraska Panhandle
  Southeast Wyoming

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 120 PM until
  800 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 75
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 2 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will intensify through the afternoon off the
foothills of northeast Colorado and southeast Wyoming.  A few severe
storms are expected, capable of large hail and damaging wind gusts
through the early evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles east and west of a line from 15 miles east northeast
of Torrington WY to 50 miles south southeast of Limon CO. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 65 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
27030.

Areas affected...east North Carolina

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 061251Z - 061515Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A marginal increase in tornado potential may occur this
morning as Tropical Storm Chantal continues to move inland. The
overall tornado potential should remain low enough to preclude the
need for a TC-related Tornado Watch. However, trends will be
monitored.

DISCUSSION...A marginal increase in tornado potential may occur this
morning as Tropical Storm Chantal continues to move inland. This
marginal increase would coincide with modest diurnal heating
increasing and several feeder bands streaming inland on the eastern
semicircle of Chantal. The onshore environment containing these
feeder bands has little instability at present and the low-level
storm-relative helicity is on the lower side of land-falling
tropical cyclones. That said, the low-level storm-relative helicity
still remains sufficient for low-level rotation with stronger
thunderstorm updrafts. Present thinking is that the limited
instability and modest low-level helicity should preclude any longer
duration/larger area tornado threat and thus a TC-related tornado
watch is not currently anticipated. However, trends will continue to
be evaluated for increasing buoyancy and/or low-level helicity.

Mesoscale Discussion 1574
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0714 AM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025

Areas affected...southwest South Dakota and north-central Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 061214Z - 061415Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Ongoing thunderstorms should persist for another couple of
hours before weakening. Isolated hail and a damaging wind gust or
two will remain possible in the near term. A watch is not currently
expected.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms continue this morning across southwest
South Dakota along the southwest portion of a remnant MCS that moved
across this region overnight. These thunderstorms appear to be
driven by isentropic ascent focused atop a residual cold pool left
over from the overnight convection. This shows up as strong warm-air
advection centered around 700 MB in regional mesoanalysis.
Mesoanalysis also indicates a rich CAPE reservoir to the southwest
of the ongoing storms, within the thunderstorm source/inflow region,
providing additional buoyancy. With time, diurnal heating should
begin to modify the existing cold pool and weaken the isentropic
ascent/WAA leading to a downward trend in thunderstorm intensity.
Before this weakening occurs, lapse rates do not appear particular
steep this morning per RAP-model forecast soundings, and an
isotherms layer extends upward from the surface to around 800 mb.
This should limit the severe potential to isolated hail and perhaps
a damaging wind gust or two -- realistically only in the most
intense cores.

A watch is not anticipated.
