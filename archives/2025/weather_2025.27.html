Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0754 AM CDT Fri Jul 11 2025

Valid 111300Z - 121200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE MIDWEST
AND CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected this afternoon and evening across
the Midwest to southern portions of the Great Lakes region,
accompanied by a risk for damaging wind gusts, hail, as well as some
tornado potential. Severe thunderstorms are also expected across the
central/southern High Plains and Upper Midwest.

...Midwest/Lower Missouri Valley to Great Lakes...
A decayed overnight MCS and residual convection/cloud cover will
reinforce the baroclinic zone regionally. Near/south of the
boundary, surface dew points near and above 70F, beneath modestly
steep mid-level lapse rates, are forecast to contribute to CAPE on
the order of 2000-3000 J/kg. This will be beneath a lingering belt
of convectively augmented mid-level flow (on the order of 30-50 kt
in the 700-500 mb layer). Coupled with modest, clockwise-curved
low-level hodographs in advance of a weak surface wave, the
environment should become conducive to supercell structures into
mid/late afternoon. These supercells may pose a risk for hail and
potentially a couple of tornadoes across parts of northern Missouri
and southern/eastern Iowa into northern Illinois, and possibly far
southern Wisconsin. Damaging wind gusts should become the more
predominant potential hazard as convection tends to grow upscale
into east/southeastward-moving clusters this evening.

...Central High Plains...
The immediate post-frontal regime should be favorable for severe
storm development this afternoon into evening across southeast
Wyoming and northeast Colorado into southwest Nebraska/northwest
Kansas. Some initial supercells capable of large hail can be
expected, and one or more east/eastward-moving clusters may evolve
by evening with severe-caliber winds also a possibility.

...Upper Midwest...
At least isolated strong to severe thunderstorms can be expected
near the east/southeastward-moving front this afternoon, including
the eastern Dakotas into much of Minnesota. This will be influenced
by the amplifying upper-level trough approaching the
Dakotas/northern Minnesota. The strongest winds aloft/vertical shear
will tend to lag the front, but ample near/pre-frontal buoyancy will
support storms capable of hail/wind.

...Southern Rockies into the Great Plains...
Thermodynamic profiles characterized by modest low-level moisture,
but with generally steep lapse rates, including fairly deep
boundary-layer mixing, may become conducive to scattered
thunderstorm clusters posing a risk for severe wind and hail late
this afternoon and evening. A degree of storm organization may be
aided by modest shear beneath northwesterly mid-level flow, with
thunderstorm activity mostly initiating off the higher terrain of
the Front Range through Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Additionally,
low-level convergence within surface troughing across southern
Kansas through the Oklahoma/Texas Panhandle vicinity may also become
sufficient for thunderstorm initiation during the peak late
afternoon heating, and one or more semi-organized clusters capable
of wind damage could evolve. This region will be reevaluated in
subsequent outlooks for potential inclusion of a wind-related Slight
Risk.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0340 AM CDT Fri Jul 11 2025

Valid 141200Z - 191200Z

...DISCUSSION...
A surface cold front across the southern Great Plains early in the
period will quickly redevelop northward into the northern Plains in
response to strong lee cyclogenesis across the northern High Plains.
This cyclogenesis will occur in response to a positive-tilt
short-wave trough moving through the broadly zonal mid-level flow
across the northern US. 

This front will move back south during the period as a seasonably
strong high pressure builds southward into the central US in the
wake of the aforementioned short-wave trough. Thunderstorms are
likely to develop in the vicinity of the front/aggregate outflow
boundary each afternoon as it moves south. However, given the lack
of significant flow amplification as the mid-level wave crosses the
northern US, it is likely that thunderstorms will remain displaced
south of the requisite effective-layer shear needed to promote an
organized severe threat identifiable at this time range.

One exception to the idea that storms will be displaced from the
better shear may take place on Monday/Day-4 across portions of North
Dakota. Here, low-level moisture will surge northward in response to
the aforementioned northern High Plains lee cyclogenesis. Steep
mid-level lapse rates will overspread the northern Great Plains
during the day, yielding most-unstable CAPE values ranging from 1000
J/kg to perhaps 3000 J/kg depending on model guidance.  

However, run-to-run inconsistency in the space and time evolution of
relevant features leads to little confidence in identifying where
any overlap of thunderstorms, instability, and effective-layer shear
might support severe thunderstorms. However, if model guidance
begins to converge on potential scenarios, probabilistic delineation
may become warranted in subsequent forecasts.

Mesoscale Discussion 1633
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0243 PM CDT Thu Jul 10 2025

Areas affected...Eastern Colorado to northeast New Mexico and
northwest Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 101943Z - 102145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms moving off the Rockies will be capable of
severe downburst winds from eastern Colorado into northeast New
Mexico and northwest Kansas. Thunderstorm coverage is expected to be
relatively higher across CO, and may require watch issuance in the
short-term.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm coverage has slowly increased over the
past 1-2 hours across central CO. Observed dewpoint depressions on
the order of 40-50 F hint that very deep/dry boundary layers are in
place east of the Front Range across the High Plains. While buoyancy
is fairly limited (MLCAPE around 250-500 J/kg), LCLs between 3-4 km
will favor very strong downdraft accelerations via evaporative
cooling. Severe downburst winds have already been observed with more
isolated convection earlier today, and velocity imagery from KFTG is
showing 40-50 knot low-level outflow winds associated with stronger
convective cores. The potential for severe winds should increase in
tandem with convective coverage through the late afternoon hours
when diurnal heating/mixing will be maximized. Expanding cold pools
coupled with 25-35 knot 0-6 km bulk shear may support the
development of one or more organized clusters that could pose a more
robust wind threat with gusts potentially as high as 80 mph. In
general, thunderstorm coverage should remain greatest across CO due
to ascent associated with a passing mid-level wave and weak cold
front, though more isolated severe storms are possible further south
into northeast NM. Watch issuance is probable for portions of the
region as thunderstorm coverage (and the severe wind threat)
increases.

Mesoscale Discussion 1632
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0241 PM CDT Thu Jul 10 2025

Areas affected...much of western Kansas into south-central Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 101941Z - 102145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Storms will develop across much of western Kansas and into
south-central Nebraska, with damaging wind gusts likely. Isolated
large hail may also occur.

DISCUSSION...Satellite imagery shows towering CU developing with a
surface trough/wind shift from the western OK across KS and into
south-central NE. Temperatures within this zone are near 100 F,
while dewpoints have only only mixed down into the mid to upper 50s
F. 

Given the hot and deeply mixed boundary layer, strong wind gusts
appear probable. Veering winds with height also suggest some
cellular mode is possible as well, and isolated hail may occur with
the strongest storms. However, northeastward propagating mixed-mode
severe appears most likely.

Mesoscale Discussion 1631
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0220 PM CDT Thu Jul 10 2025

Areas affected...north-central into eastern Nebraska...far southeast
South Dakota...western Iowa

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 101920Z - 102145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Severe storms are expected to develop close to 21Z over
north-central Nebraska, with activity spreading east/southeast
across the Missouri River this evening. A tornado and hail risk may
exist initially, following by a corridor of significant damaging
wind potential.

DISCUSSION...Satellite and radar indicate an arcing line of elevated
thunderstorms over northeast NE, spreading into southeast SD and
western IA. This activity is supported by theta-e advection with
southwest flow off the surface, with steep lapse rates aloft.

Behind this activity, temporary subsidence and clearing exist over
eastern NE. While initially cool, this air mass should destabilize
again this evening.

Meanwhile, a large CU field is currently developing over central and
north-central NE, near a stationary front. Deep moisture convergence
will persist in this area, with the cap being breached later this
afternoon. Aiding cap removal are hot temperatures just downstream
into northern KS/southern NE, where temperatures are over 100 F.

Veering winds with height, combined with strong instability, will
favor slow-moving supercells at first, with tornado and large hail
risk. With time, a severe MCS is forecast, with increasing damaging
wind potential. Significant wind gusts over 75 mph appear likely.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 502
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
230 PM MDT Thu Jul 10 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Eastern Colorado
  Western and Central Kansas
  Southwest and South-Central Nebraska

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 230 PM until
  900 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 75
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm coverage is expected to increase across a
wide area from the Colorado Front Range into western Kansas and
south-central Nebraska this afternoon, with storms continuing into
the evening. Some isolated hail is possible with these storms,
particularly along the Front Range, but the primary severe hazard is
expected to be strong wind gusts. Some wind gusts to 75 mph are
possible.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 130
statute miles east and west of a line from 25 miles northeast of
Imperial NE to 15 miles east southeast of Elkhart KS. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 501
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
310 PM CDT Thu Jul 10 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Far Western Iowa
  Northeast Nebraska
  Extreme Southeast South Dakota

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 310 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 80
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter likely

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development is anticipated within the very
unstable airmass across central/northeast NE this afternoon.
Environmental conditions support initial supercells capable of all
severe hazards, including large to very large hail and tornadoes.
Upscale growth is anticipated after the initial cellular mode, with
the resultant convective line progressing quickly eastward. Strong
wind gusts are possible within this line, including gusts over 75
mph.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 75 statute miles
north and south of a line from 5 miles north northwest of Broken Bow
NE to 10 miles east of Denison IA. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 70 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 27035.

0259 PM CDT Thu Jul 10 2025

Valid 102000Z - 111200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PARTS OF
THE MID-MISSOURI VALLEY...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM EASTERN
COLORADO INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS AND PORTIONS OF IOWA...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms capable of large hail, damaging winds, and
perhaps a couple of tornadoes are possible late this afternoon into
tonight across parts of the central Great Plains to the Midwest,
particularly across the Middle Missouri Valley. Additional severe
storms are expected across parts of the Northeast and Southeast.

...20Z Update...
In the wake of MCV moving into western Wisconsin, a belt of stronger
shear is evident where modest northwesterly flow aloft is positioned
over surface southeasterly winds in central/eastern Iowa.
Furthermore, temperatures have risen into the upper 80s/low 90s F.
Given the potential for widely scattered to scattered storms to
develop on the southwestern flank of the MCV, the Slight risk has
been expanded into more of eastern Iowa. The remainder of the
outlook is unchanged. See the previous discussion for additional
details.

..Wendt.. 07/10/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1133 AM CDT Thu Jul 10 2025/

...Central High Plains through the Central Plains into IA...
Recent surface analysis places a low near the NE/CO border, with a
moist airmass ahead of it over the central Plains. Satellite imagery
also shows a shortwave trough moving through the Great Basin towards
the central High Plains. Both of these features are expected to move
eastward throughout the day, with the surface low contributing to
eventual convective initiation over far southeast SD/northeast NE
and northwest IA this afternoon. The shortwave is expected to result
in numerous thunderstorms over the high terrain, with these storms
then moving eastward into the central High Plains. 

The thunderstorms that develop near the surface low will encounter a
strongly unstable and moderately sheared environment supportive of
initial supercells capable of all severe hazards, including very
large hail and tornadoes. This activity should quickly grow upscale,
with the resulting convective line pushing southeastward into more
of northeast NE and western IA. Given ample buoyancy downstream,
some significant wind gusts are possible as this line moves
eastward/southeastward.

Farther west, the thunderstorms moving into the central High Plains
will initially be high-based and capable of strong wind gusts as
they move into the very deeply mixed airmass downstream. Some
amalgamation along cold pools is possible here over time, with the
resulting convective line likely moving eastward across
south-central NE and central KS. Damaging gusts will be possible as
this line moves eastward.

...Mid MS Valley...
A well-defined MCV is currently moving across southern MN, with the
expectation that it will continue gradually eastward throughout the
day. Daytime heating along the southern/southeastern periphery of
this vorticity max will likely result in airmass destabilization and
moderate buoyancy from eastern IA into southern WI and northern IL
this afternoon. Mesoscale ascent attendant to the MCV will interact
with this airmass, likely resulting in thunderstorm development. Low
to mid-level flow enhanced by the MCV will result in moderate
vertical shear and the potential for a few supercells. Given the
mesoscale nature of this scenario, overall storm coverage, including
the supercell coverage, is uncertain. Any supercells that do develop
could result in a threat for all severe hazards, including large
hail and a brief tornado. Conditionality of the overall scenario
merits only low severe probabilities for now, but higher
probabilities maybe needed for the 20Z if trends merit.

...New England and Upper Ohio Valley...
A shortwave trough currently is moving through the base of the
larger cyclone over central/eastern ON. This shortwave is forecast
to continue eastward throughout the day, resulting in broad ascent
from the Upper OH Valley into New England. Scattered thunderstorm
development is probable during peak afternoon heating, as this wave
interacts with moderate buoyancy and vertical shear. A predominantly
multicellular mode is anticipated, with damaging winds and isolated
hail as the primary risks. A corridor of slightly better low-level
moisture is expected over the Champlain Valley vicinity, which could
result in both greater storm coverage and stronger, more long-lived
updrafts. As a result, there is a small area where higher severe
coverage is possible. 

...Southeast/Southern Atlantic Seaboard...
A very moist airmass is in place across the Southeast and southern
Atlantic Seaboard. Recent surface analysis reveals dewpoints in the
low to mid 70s areawide. 12Z soundings at FFC, JAX, and CHS sampled
PW values of 1.91", 1.97", and 2.14", respectively. This ample
low-level moisture will help support airmass destabilization and
moderate to strong buoyancy as temperatures increase into the upper
80s and low 90s this afternoon. Subtle ascent along the southern
periphery of broad upper troughing will interact with this unstable
and buoyant airmass to support scattered strong to severe
thunderstorms this afternoon through early/mid-evening.

Vertical shear across the region will be very weak, resulting in an
outflow-dominant storm mode, with new development then occurring
along these outflows. Water-loaded downbursts will be the primary
hazard as these clusters gradually move southeastward over time.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0233 PM CDT Thu Jul 10 2025

Valid 121200Z - 181200Z

Upper ridging will develop across the western CONUS through the
weekend, before a mid-level trough traverses the Pacific Northwest
and northern Rockies by early next week. Thereafter, upper ridging
will briefly set in during the middle of next week before another
mid-level trough impinges on the Northwest before next weekend. The
net result will be a warming and drying trend across much of the
Interior West into the Pacific Northwest, which will augment the
curing of fuels. 

The passage of the first mid-level trough will provide enough upper
support to induce dry/windy conditions across portions of the
Cascades on Day 4 (Sunday), and then farther east over the Snake
River Plain Days 5-6 (Monday-Tuesday), where 40 percent Critical
probabilities have been introduced. Isolated dry thunderstorms could
occur across portions of the Pacific Northwest into the northern and
central Rockies early next week, but the specifics of timing and
coverage (given model differences) are too unclear to warrant dry
thunderstorm probabilities at this time. Furthermore, considerable
spread exists among medium-range guidance in the placement and
timing of the next mid-level trough late next week. Given these
uncertainties, probabilities for dry/windy conditions and dry
thunderstorms have been withheld.

0228 PM CDT Thu Jul 10 2025

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN THE LOWER MI
VICINITY...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered damaging winds are possible across the Lower Michigan
vicinity on Saturday afternoon. A broad swath of isolated severe
thunderstorms is anticipated from the Great Lakes to the southern
High Plains, mainly Saturday afternoon/evening.

...Great Lakes...
A shortwave trough should be centered on the MB/ON to the Dakotas/MN
border at 12Z Saturday. An embedded impulse should take on an
increasingly negative tilt as it ejects through the basal region of
the trough. This will help broaden the belt of moderate mid-level
(30-45 kts at 500 mb) southwesterlies across most of the Great
Lakes. Large spread, typical for this time of year, exists with the
handling of downstream MCVs and related flow/ascent enhancements, as
well as mesoscale placement of the effective outflow boundary from
prior day convection. The most likely corridor for ample buoyancy
development should be from southern/eastern Lower MI southward in
the Midwest. Stronger deep-layer shear will overlap the synoptic
cold front farther west in central/eastern WI and western Upper MI.
However, the degree of destabilization in this corridor is
uncertain. An ensemble of D3 CAM guidance and ML severe probs
suggests that the Lower MI vicinity will have the best chance at
clusters capable of scattered damaging winds during Saturday
afternoon.

...Mid-MS Valley to the Southern High Plains...
Multiple areas of general thunderstorms are expected to be ongoing
at 12Z Saturday from the Ozarks to the southern High Plains. With
only peripheral influence of the Upper Midwest shortwave trough,
afternoon to evening severe potential will be tied to the influence
of remnant MCVs embedded within generally weak deep-layer shear.
Greater concentration of thunderstorms that may grow upscale into a
slow-moving MCS on Saturday evening seems plausible across a portion
of the southern High Plains. Mesoscale predictability warrants
broad, low severe probabilities at this time.

1253 PM CDT Thu Jul 10 2025

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

An isolated dry thunderstorm delineation was added to portions of
western Colorado for tomorrow (Friday). Thunderstorms should develop
over the higher terrain as upper-support glances the region from the
north. The storms should be initially dry before transitioning to a
more wet phase as they advance toward the central High Plains, where
greater moisture/buoyancy will be present. Fuels are dry across
western Colorado, with ERCs exceeding critically dry thresholds, and
fuel moisture dipping into the single digits amid a severe drought
and more than a month without appreciable rainfall. As such, any
thunderstorms developing over the drier fuel beds will have
considerable ignition potential, warranting the introduction of
isolated dry thunderstorm highlights.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1057 PM CDT Wed Jul 09 2025/

...Synopsis...
A large-scale ridge will build over the western CONUS on Friday,
resulting in a warming trend and lighter surface winds. Outside of
terrain-favored areas, this will generally limit fire-weather
concerns regionally compared to previous days.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE LOWER MO
VALLEY TO THE SOUTHERN GREAT LAKES...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered damaging winds, a tornado or two, and isolated severe hail
are possible, mainly in the mid-afternoon to mid-evening on Friday
from the Lower Missouri Valley to the southern Great Lakes.

...Lower MO Valley to the southern Great Lakes...
Remnants of a probable severe MCS on D1 over the Mid-MO Valley
should be ongoing from eastern IA to southern Lower MI at 12Z
Friday. In its wake, the composite MCV/low-amplitude shortwave
trough should drift east across the Upper MS Valley. A compact belt
of enhanced 700-500 mb winds will aid in another round of multicell
clusters later in the afternoon as storms redevelop along trailing
outflows to the Lower MO Valley. Large buoyancy will promote initial
severe hail transitioning to scattered strong to severe gusts.
Whether a forward-propagating MCS will develop with a greater severe
wind threat is uncertain given low confidence on mesoscale placement
of prior convective outflow coincident with the compact flow
enhancement. A tornado or two is also possible, focused along
wherever the large-scale convective outflow sets up.

...Upper Midwest...
Isolated severe storms from both damaging winds and hail are
possible as scattered to widespread thunderstorms develop by late
afternoon to early evening Friday along the synoptic cold front from
northern MN to eastern SD. Despite ample buoyancy ahead of the
front, mid-level flow enhancement should be largely confined west of
the front. This will be due to the initial positive-tilt orientation
and compactness of the shortwave trough across the southern Canadian
Prairies into the northern Great Plains. 

...Central to southern High Plains...
Modest mid-level northwesterlies will support an isolated severe
threat across the bulk of the High Plains amid a moderately buoyant
airmass. Post-frontal, upslope flow should yield a few weak
supercells in the southeast WY/northeast CO vicinity. Adequate
deep-layer shear should exist for transient mid-level rotation and
multicell clustering in eastern NM and west TX. Isolated severe
wind/hail are possible from mid-afternoon to mid-evening Friday.

...East...
A low-amplitude mid-level trough will move east from QC to the
Canadian Maritimes. Weak height rises/warming mid-level temperatures
will occur in its wake across New England, limiting convective
coverage/intensity on Friday. Isolated to widely scattered
thunderstorms are probable along the lee of the Appalachians into
the higher terrain of southern New England. Weaker deep-layer shear
and lower PW values relative to prior days will temper wet
microburst potential. Have maintained a level 1-MRGL risk where the
greatest coverage of pulse storms is expected.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS FAR
SOUTHEAST SD...NORTHEAST NE...AND WESTERN IA...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS FAR
NORTHEAST NY AND MOST OF VT...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms capable of large hail, damaging winds, and
perhaps a couple of tornadoes are possible late this afternoon into
tonight across parts of the central Great Plains to the Midwest,
particularly across the Middle Missouri Valley. Additional severe
storms are expected across parts of the Northeast and Southeast.

...Central High Plains through the Central Plains into IA...
Recent surface analysis places a low near the NE/CO border, with a
moist airmass ahead of it over the central Plains. Satellite imagery
also shows a shortwave trough moving through the Great Basin towards
the central High Plains. Both of these features are expected to move
eastward throughout the day, with the surface low contributing to
eventual convective initiation over far southeast SD/northeast NE
and northwest IA this afternoon. The shortwave is expected to result
in numerous thunderstorms over the high terrain, with these storms
then moving eastward into the central High Plains. 

The thunderstorms that develop near the surface low will encounter a
strongly unstable and moderately sheared environment supportive of
initial supercells capable of all severe hazards, including very
large hail and tornadoes. This activity should quickly grow upscale,
with the resulting convective line pushing southeastward into more
of northeast NE and western IA. Given ample buoyancy downstream,
some significant wind gusts are possible as this line moves
eastward/southeastward.

Farther west, the thunderstorms moving into the central High Plains
will initially be high-based and capable of strong wind gusts as
they move into the very deeply mixed airmass downstream. Some
amalgamation along cold pools is possible here over time, with the
resulting convective line likely moving eastward across
south-central NE and central KS. Damaging gusts will be possible as
this line moves eastward.

...Mid MS Valley...
A well-defined MCV is currently moving across southern MN, with the
expectation that it will continue gradually eastward throughout the
day. Daytime heating along the southern/southeastern periphery of
this vorticity max will likely result in airmass destabilization and
moderate buoyancy from eastern IA into southern WI and northern IL
this afternoon. Mesoscale ascent attendant to the MCV will interact
with this airmass, likely resulting in thunderstorm development. Low
to mid-level flow enhanced by the MCV will result in moderate
vertical shear and the potential for a few supercells. Given the
mesoscale nature of this scenario, overall storm coverage, including
the supercell coverage, is uncertain. Any supercells that do develop
could result in a threat for all severe hazards, including large
hail and a brief tornado. Conditionality of the overall scenario
merits only low severe probabilities for now, but higher
probabilities maybe needed for the 20Z if trends merit.

...New England and Upper Ohio Valley...
A shortwave trough currently is moving through the base of the
larger cyclone over central/eastern ON. This shortwave is forecast
to continue eastward throughout the day, resulting in broad ascent
from the Upper OH Valley into New England. Scattered thunderstorm
development is probable during peak afternoon heating, as this wave
interacts with moderate buoyancy and vertical shear. A predominantly
multicellular mode is anticipated, with damaging winds and isolated
hail as the primary risks. A corridor of slightly better low-level
moisture is expected over the Champlain Valley vicinity, which could
result in both greater storm coverage and stronger, more long-lived
updrafts. As a result, there is a small area where higher severe
coverage is possible. 

...Southeast/Southern Atlantic Seaboard...
A very moist airmass is in place across the Southeast and southern
Atlantic Seaboard. Recent surface analysis reveals dewpoints in the
low to mid 70s areawide. 12Z soundings at FFC, JAX, and CHS sampled
PW values of 1.91", 1.97", and 2.14", respectively. This ample
low-level moisture will help support airmass destabilization and
moderate to strong buoyancy as temperatures increase into the upper
80s and low 90s this afternoon. Subtle ascent along the southern
periphery of broad upper troughing will interact with this unstable
and buoyant airmass to support scattered strong to severe
thunderstorms this afternoon through early/mid-evening.

Vertical shear across the region will be very weak, resulting in an
outflow-dominant storm mode, with new development then occurring
along these outflows. Water-loaded downbursts will be the primary
hazard as these clusters gradually move southeastward over time.

Mesoscale Discussion 1620
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0343 PM CDT Wed Jul 09 2025

Areas affected...Portions of
Maryland...Delaware...Pennsylvania...and New Jersey

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 497...

Valid 092043Z - 092245Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 497
continues.

SUMMARY...Convective trends are being monitored for the need for
downstream watch issuance across parts of Maryland, Delaware,
Pennsylvania, and New Jersey as storms spread east through early
evening.

DISCUSSION...Regional radar mosaics continue to show a slow, but
steady, increase in convective coverage across southern PA and parts
of northern MD as lift associated with a mid-level impulse continues
to migrate east and overspreads a moderately buoyant air mass.
Regional VWPs continue to sample 30-40 knot mid-level flow
associated with the upper feature, but the nebulous forcing for
ascent and modest mid-level lapse rates appear to be modulating
convective intensity and longevity of more discrete cells across
PA/MD. While the convective parameter space is supportive of
organized/severe convection, it remains unclear how intense
convection will become over the next few hours. 

Further south into eastern MD and DE, confidence is higher in a
severe wind threat later this evening. A squall line is slowly
organizing across central VA and is expected to continue
intensifying over the next few hours (see recently issued MCD #1619
for additional details). Recent surface observations and MLCAPE
analyses show a plume of rich low-level moisture/buoyancy extending
into southern DE/southeast MD, which should maintain the convective
line as it spreads east into the evening hours. Slow storm motions
cast some uncertainty on exactly when a downstream watch will be
needed, but recent high-res guidance suggest a damaging wind threat
will begin to materialize between 23-01 UTC.

Mesoscale Discussion 1619
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0249 PM CDT Wed Jul 09 2025

Areas affected...Far northern North Carolina into Virginia and
southern Maryland

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 497...

Valid 091949Z - 092145Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 497
continues.

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm intensification is ongoing across northern
North Carolina into Virginia. An increase in damaging/severe wind
potential is expected over the next couple of hours.

DISCUSSION...A leading convective band emanating off the Blue Ridge
Mountains is becoming established from northern VA into far
northwest NC. Latest GOES IR imagery shows rapid cloud-top cooling
associated with several deeper embedded convective cores, signifying
robust intensification. Buoyancy immediately downstream continues to
increase with temperatures warming into the upper 80s/low 90s and
MLCAPE approaching 2500 J/kg as of the 20z RAP mesoanalysis. This
air mass should promote further intensification over the next
several hours and is favorable for strong water-loaded downbursts.
At this point, storm mode should primarily be linear given mean flow
oriented along the developing band. 25-30 knot bulk shear should
support a few embedded surging segments within the line that may
pose a few focused corridors of damaging/severe winds with gusts as
high as 55-65 mph. Latest guidance hints that this potential should
be maximized over the next few hours from the NC/VA border into
central VA.

Mesoscale Discussion 1618

0248 PM CDT Wed Jul 09 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern Idaho into southern Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 091948Z - 092115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Severe gusts will become an increasing concern as at least
scattered thunderstorms develop and mature through the afternoon. A
Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance may be needed.

DISCUSSION...Deepening CU over eastern ID/southern MT are indicating
attempts at thunderstorm initiation atop a destabilizing boundary
layer with eroding convective inhibition. 19Z mesoanalysis shows
boundary-layer lapse rates already reaching 9 C/km in some spots,
with 500+ J/kg MLCAPE. RAP forecast soundings indicate a dry
boundary layer extending to 500 mb, which is being overspread by
stronger mid-upper level flow and 30 kts of effective bulk shear
(i.e. straight hodographs indicating speed shear). Organized,
high-based multicells should traverse portions of the the northern
Rockies, accompanied by mainly a severe gust threat. If confidence
increases in greater coverage of severe gusts, a Severe Thunderstorm
Watch may be needed.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 498
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
145 PM MDT Wed Jul 9 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  South-Central North Dakota
  Northwest into North-Central Nebraska
  Western and Central South Dakota

* Effective this Wednesday afternoon and evening from 145 PM
  until 900 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 80
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development is anticipated over the next few
hours from the western Dakotas down into the Nebraska Panhandle. A
few discrete supercells are possible within this region before
evolving towards a more linear mode with time. One or more
convective lines could then move eastward into more of the central
Dakotas and north-central Nebraska, with strong to severe gusts as
the primary risk. Some gusts over 75 mph are possible.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 85
statute miles east and west of a line from 30 miles northwest of
Bismarck ND to 40 miles southwest of Mullen NE. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1157 AM CDT Wed Jul 09 2025

Valid 091700Z - 101200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN NEVADA AND FAR WESTERN
UTAH...

...Montana...
A mid-level trough translating east across the Canada/U.S. border
and subsequent breakdown of upper-level ridge over the Northern
Rockies along with sufficient mid-level moisture/instability will
aid in high-based thunderstorm development across the higher terrain
of western MT, moving into eastern MT by evening. Fast
east-northeastward thunderstorm trajectories on the order of 25-30
knots will limit rainfall (in addition to gusty/erratic outflow
winds) over dry fuels, supporting an increased wildfire spread
potential for portions of central and eastern MT where isolated dry
thunderstorm highlights were added.

Otherwise, previous forecast (see below) for additional fire weather
threats across the Western U.S. remains on track with minimal
changes.

..Williams.. 07/09/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0156 AM CDT Wed Jul 09 2025/

...Synopsis...
A compact midlevel trough will advance eastward across the northern
Great Basin during the day. At the same time, a separate large-scale
trough will move eastward across western Canada.

...Great Basin...
Preceding the compact midlevel trough, moderate deep-layer
southwesterly flow will overspread the Great Basin during peak
heating. Deep boundary-layer mixing into this strengthening flow
aloft will result in an expansive area of lower-teens RH and 20-25
mph sustained west-southwesterly surface winds. Given increasingly
dry fuels across the region, critical fire-weather conditions are
expected from central NV into western UT (with elevated conditions
surrounding this area across the Great Basin).

...Northwest...
Large-scale ascent accompanying the compact midlevel trough will aid
in isolated to widely scattered thunderstorm development over
southeastern OR, southwestern ID, and far northeastern CA during the
afternoon/evening hours. Deep inverted-V soundings and 0.5-0.7 inch
PW will favor dry thunderstorms -- with a risk of lightning-induced
ignitions and strong/erratic outflow winds. 

Additionally, strong westerly flow in the base of the large-scale
trough moving across western Canada will persist across the
Cascades. Despite slightly higher RH than previous days, strong
downslope/westerly surface winds will favor elevated to locally
critical fire-weather conditions in the Columbia Basin.

Mesoscale Discussion 1608
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0257 PM CDT Tue Jul 08 2025

Areas affected...portions of northeast Wisconsin and the UP of
Michigan

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 081957Z - 082130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong to severe storms may pose a risk for
damaging gusts and some hail this afternoon. A WW is not
anticipated.

DISCUSSION...Across portions of the upper Great Lakes, isolated
thunderstorms have developed along a weak front/wind shift this
afternoon.  Aided by weak ascent from a broad shortwave trough,
additional storm development/maturation is possible over the next
few hours. Warming surface temperatures and 60s F dewpoints were
supporting ~1000 J/kg of MCLAPE. Sufficient for strong updrafts,
35-40 kt of flow aloft will also favor some organization with
supercell structures or clusters. Isolated damaging gusts and some
hail are possible with the strongest storms.

The environment should continue to support occasional strong to
severe storms over the next few hours as the wind shift continues
toward the western shores of Lake Michigan. HRRR guidance suggests
additional storms are possible farther south into northern WI with
time. However, the limited overlap of buoyancy and shear, plus the
limited duration before crossing offshore suggests the overall
severe potential is low. A WW is unlikely, though convective trends
will be monitored.

Mesoscale Discussion 1607
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0232 PM CDT Tue Jul 08 2025

Areas affected...Portions of the Mid-Atlantic

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 496...

Valid 081932Z - 082130Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 496
continues.

SUMMARY...A line of thunderstorms is showing signs of
intensification; the damaging wind potential is expected to increase
over the coming hours as the line of storms approaches the I-95
corridor.

DISCUSSION...Latest GOES IR imagery shows steady cloud-top cooling
of individual cells embedded within a developing convective band as
convection begins moving off of the higher terrain and into a very
buoyant air mass in place downstream across the Mid-Atlantic. Latest
RAP mesoanalysis estimates suggest that MLCAPE ahead of the
developing line has increased to around 2500 J/kg as surface
temperatures warm into the mid 90s. Additionally, regional VWPs are
sampling 20-30 knot mid-level winds, which is supporting slightly
stronger deep-layer bulk shear values than depicted by recent
RAP/mesoanalysis estimates, which should contribute to better
organization and longevity of the developing band. Consequently, the
intensification trend is expected to continue as storms spread east
over the next few hours. As this occurs, the potential for
damaging/severe winds should also increase as cold pool
consolidation/organization continues. Recent storm track estimates
suggest that this activity should reach the I-95 corridor roughly
during the 20-22 UTC time frame, which should be when diurnal
heating and MLCAPE magnitudes will be maximized.

Mesoscale Discussion 1595
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0328 PM CDT Mon Jul 07 2025

Areas affected...south-central Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 072028Z - 072200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated storms capable of large hail/damaging winds
expected to to continue. Watch issuance is possible but remains
uncertain in the short term.

DISCUSSION...Visible satellite/radar shows a few isolated storms
that have developed during peak heating amid a very unstable
airmass, characterized by MLCAPE values nearing 3000 J/kg. Deep
layer shear has remained somewhat marginal thus far, perhaps
approaching 30-35 kt, but is forecast to increase with time. Thus,
storms should exhibit supercell characteristics, with large hail and
damaging winds the primary threats. Southeasterly low-level flow is
promoting at least some elongation of hodographs, but low-level
shear remains weak in general. Thus, the tornado threat appears low
but cannot be ruled out. These storms are expected to remain
isolated, and thus, watch issuance is not anticipated in the short
term. However, convective trends will be monitored should a watch be
needed for the region.

Mesoscale Discussion 1594
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0303 PM CDT Mon Jul 07 2025

Areas affected...Far northeast New York...northern Vermont and New
Hampshire...and into central Maine

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 072003Z - 072200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong thunderstorms may pose a severe wind/hail
risk through the afternoon and early evening hours. This threat is
expected to remain sufficiently isolated to preclude watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...Latest regional radar imagery shows a gradual
maturation of convection across far northeast NY and across central
ME along/ahead of a cold front. Temperatures warming into the low
80s with dewpoints in the upper 60s to low 70s is slowly eroding
inhibition with MLCAPE increasing to around 500-1000 J/kg region
wide. This warming trend should continue and will promote further
thunderstorm intensification over the next couple of hours. 30-40
knot mid-level winds in proximity to a weakening upper trough are
supporting sufficient hodograph elongation for organized convection.
While convective mode will likely transition to predominantly a
semi-organized convective band due to strong flow along the
initiating cold front, an initial supercell or two appears possible
and may pose a severe hail/wind risk through the afternoon -
especially across central ME where forcing for ascent is currently
more nebulous. With time, strong to severe winds should become the
predominant hazard as a band of storms begins to emerge. Despite
these concerns, the overall severe threat is expected to remain
sufficiently isolated to preclude watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1593
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0255 PM CDT Mon Jul 07 2025

Areas affected...eastern North Dakota and northwest Minnesota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 071955Z - 072200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Large hail, damaging winds, and perhaps a tornado are
possible this afternoon/evening. Watch issuance is possible.

DISCUSSION...Regional satellite/radar show convection developing
along a cold front positioned from northeast North Dakota extending
southwestward, and along a warm front extending into northeast
Minnesota. This activity is developing in a region where skies have
remained clear in proximity to passing cirrus clouds to the
immediate south. In addition, cool mid-level temperatures are
overspreading the region, in association with an upper-level trough.
These factors are contributing to destabilization that is yielding
MLCAPE values near 1500 J/kg. Ample effective shear of 40-45 kt is
also present, associated with the aforementioned trough.

Storms are expected to continue increasing in coverage and severity
throughout the afternoon and into the evening. Large hail and
damaging wind gusts will be the primary threats. A tornado will also
be possible with any storm that can favorably interact with
aforementioned warm front. Coverage of storms remains uncertain in
the short term, given the extent of the cirrus shield limiting
destabilization. However, at least some CAM solutions suggest
greater coverage may materialize. Thus, convective trends will be
monitored for possible watch issuance this afternoon/evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 1592
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0223 PM CDT Mon Jul 07 2025

Areas affected...northeast Colorado...far southeast
Wyoming...southwest Nebraska...and northwest Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 071923Z - 072130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered severe storms expected by mid/late afternoon,
posing a threat for severe wind/hail. Watch possible.

DISCUSSION...Visible satellite show a broad area of terrain
generated convection over the mountains of central/northern Colorado
into far southeast Wyoming. Additional convection is now forming
downstream of this activity, along the lee of the Rockies. Clear
skies have promoted strong insolation amid a relatively moist
low-level airmass for the central High Plains, with dew point
temperatures in the mid/upper 50s F. This is contributing to an
west-to-east instability gradient, with MLCAPE values approaching
1500 J/kg in far northeast Colorado. Surface observations also
indicate a weak upslope flow regime in this region in advance of a
stalling cold front across the panhandle of Nebraska.

The aforementioned convection should continue to develop and
propagate eastward off the high terrain with time. As this occurs,
storms will encounter greater instability as MLCAPE values are
forecast to approach 2000-2500 J/kg. Effective shear is forecast to
increase throughout the afternoon/evening, approaching 35-45 kt.
This will help to promote storm organization into
supercell/multicell modes, with damaging winds and severe hail
expected. With time, cold pools may promote upscale growth into an
MCS this evening, transitioning into more of a damaging wind threat.
Given this potential, the area is being monitored for possible watch
issuance this afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1582
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0344 PM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025

Areas affected...north-central North Carolina into far southern
Virginia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 062044Z - 062215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A brief tornado or strong wind gust will remain possible
with the convection near the remnant core of TD Chantal.

DISCUSSION...Afternoon imagery shows the remnants of TD Chantal
located across portions of north-central NC near 34.4 deg N 79.2 deg
W. Within the broader precip shield, a few deeper convective towers
have remained strong with occasional cyclonic rotation observed.
Enhanced low-level shear (0-1km SRH near 200 m2/s2) near the remnant
center will remain strong enough to support occasional low-level
mesocyclones with this convection. Despite weak buoyancy (MLCAPE
(~500 J/kg) the moist surface environment and some deeper storms may
remain capable of a brief tornado two and damaging gust into this
evening. Widespread severe weather is not anticipated, and the
interaction of the circulation with higher terrain to the west
should slowly limit the threat tonight.

Mesoscale Discussion 1581
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0326 PM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025

Areas affected...portions of northern Maine

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 062026Z - 062200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated to widely scattered thunderstorms, including a
few supercells, may pose a risk for damaging gusts and small hail
this afternoon/evening. A WW is unlikely.

DISCUSSION...As of 2020 UTC, regional radar and satellite imagery
showed convection was strengthening across portions of Maine. As
temperatures have warmed into the upper 70s to low 80s, around 1000
J/kg of MLCAPE has developed with dewpoints in the 60s. While not
overly strong, this buoyancy should continue to support occasional
stronger updrafts with convection across the region. Deep-layer
shear is supportive of storm organization with the KCBW VAD showing
an elongated hodograph and 30-45 kt of bulk shear. Weak mid-level
rotation has already been observed and the environment suggests a
few supercell/organized multi cell structures are possible. With
poor lapse rates and relatively limited buoyancy, damaging gusts
still appear to be the primary risk. However, some small hail and a
brief tornado are possible with the stronger rotating storms.

HRRR guidance and observations suggests additional storm
development/intensification is plausible this afternoon with more
storms developing/moving in from eastern Canada this evening. While
some severe risk is possible, confidence in severe coverage is low
owing to weak forcing and limited buoyancy. Convective trends are
being monitored, but a WW is currently unlikely.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0218 PM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025

Areas affected...Eastern New Mexico

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 061918Z - 062145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms emanating off the southern Rockies will pose
an isolated severe wind/hail threat through the late afternoon and
early evening hours. Watch issuance is not expected.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm development within the Sangre de Cristo
and Sacramento mountains is evident in recent GOES imagery. Weak
mid-level flow over the region will likely result in slow storm
propagation off the higher terrain, but as this occurs storms will
eventually move into an unseasonably moist air mass downstream
(dewpoint values in the 75th-90th percentile for early July). This
moisture is contributing to around 1000-1500 J/kg MLCAPE that should
promote thunderstorm maintenance, and possibly intensification,
through late evening. A combination of semi-discrete cells and
propagating clusters is expected with an attendant threat for
isolated large hail (most likely near/below 1.25 inch in diameter)
and sporadic severe wind gusts. The overall severe threat is
expected to remain relatively isolated given the modest kinematic
environment, which should preclude the need for watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1578
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0138 PM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025

Areas affected...Northeast Colorado to southeast Wyoming and western
Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 061838Z - 062115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms developing within the higher terrain of the
central Rockies will spread east and intensify through the
afternoon. As this occurs, the threat for severe winds, and possibly
large hail, will increase. Watch issuance is probable later this
afternoon as thunderstorms increase in coverage and intensity.

DISCUSSION...Latest GOES imagery and lightning data shows a gradual
uptick in convection within the higher terrain of central to
northern CO and far southern WY as daytime heating drives increasing
orographic ascent within a weakly capped air mass. This initial
activity is expected to spread east into the High Plains over the
coming hours given 30-40 knot westerly flow within the CAPE-bearing
layer. Storm intensification is expected as convection overspreads a
relatively moist low-level air mass (dewpoints remain in the mid to
upper 50s downstream) and as lingering inhibition is removed via
deepening boundary-layer heating/mixing. 

Across southeast WY and western NE, slightly stronger zonal flow
aloft coupled with weak easterly low-level winds should promote
adequate deep-layer shear for a couple of supercells with an
attendant large hail risk (possibly up to 2 inches in diameter). The
tornado threat may also be locally greatest across this region due
to augmented low-level shear/SRH on the immediate cool side of a
residual outflow boundary emanating out of central NE.

Further south across CO, observed dewpoint depressions and
short-term forecast soundings suggest LCL heights should approach
2.5 to 3 km as temperatures warm into the upper 80s, which will
promote strong downdraft evaporative cooling and accelerations as
well as rapid cold pool production. Strong to severe downburst winds
and sporadic large hail appear likely within initially discrete
cells moving off the terrain and/or developing within the DCVZ, but
upscale growth into organized clusters is anticipated later this
afternoon/evening with a more widespread severe wind risk (with
gusts possibly as high as 70-80 mph). Watch issuance is probable as
these threats begin to emerge in the coming hours.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 489
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
120 PM MDT Sun Jul 6 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northeast Colorado
  Nebraska Panhandle
  Southeast Wyoming

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 120 PM until
  800 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 75
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 2 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will intensify through the afternoon off the
foothills of northeast Colorado and southeast Wyoming.  A few severe
storms are expected, capable of large hail and damaging wind gusts
through the early evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles east and west of a line from 15 miles east northeast
of Torrington WY to 50 miles south southeast of Limon CO. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 65 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
27030.

Mesoscale Discussion 1575
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0751 AM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025

Areas affected...east North Carolina

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 061251Z - 061515Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A marginal increase in tornado potential may occur this
morning as Tropical Storm Chantal continues to move inland. The
overall tornado potential should remain low enough to preclude the
need for a TC-related Tornado Watch. However, trends will be
monitored.

DISCUSSION...A marginal increase in tornado potential may occur this
morning as Tropical Storm Chantal continues to move inland. This
marginal increase would coincide with modest diurnal heating
increasing and several feeder bands streaming inland on the eastern
semicircle of Chantal. The onshore environment containing these
feeder bands has little instability at present and the low-level
storm-relative helicity is on the lower side of land-falling
tropical cyclones. That said, the low-level storm-relative helicity
still remains sufficient for low-level rotation with stronger
thunderstorm updrafts. Present thinking is that the limited
instability and modest low-level helicity should preclude any longer
duration/larger area tornado threat and thus a TC-related tornado
watch is not currently anticipated. However, trends will continue to
be evaluated for increasing buoyancy and/or low-level helicity.

Mesoscale Discussion 1574
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0714 AM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025

Areas affected...southwest South Dakota and north-central Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 061214Z - 061415Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Ongoing thunderstorms should persist for another couple of
hours before weakening. Isolated hail and a damaging wind gust or
two will remain possible in the near term. A watch is not currently
expected.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms continue this morning across southwest
South Dakota along the southwest portion of a remnant MCS that moved
across this region overnight. These thunderstorms appear to be
driven by isentropic ascent focused atop a residual cold pool left
over from the overnight convection. This shows up as strong warm-air
advection centered around 700 MB in regional mesoanalysis.
Mesoanalysis also indicates a rich CAPE reservoir to the southwest
of the ongoing storms, within the thunderstorm source/inflow region,
providing additional buoyancy. With time, diurnal heating should
begin to modify the existing cold pool and weaken the isentropic
ascent/WAA leading to a downward trend in thunderstorm intensity.
Before this weakening occurs, lapse rates do not appear particular
steep this morning per RAP-model forecast soundings, and an
isotherms layer extends upward from the surface to around 800 mb.
This should limit the severe potential to isolated hail and perhaps
a damaging wind gust or two -- realistically only in the most
intense cores.

A watch is not anticipated.
