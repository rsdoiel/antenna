Mesoscale Discussion 1620
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0343 PM CDT Wed Jul 09 2025

Areas affected...Portions of
Maryland...Delaware...Pennsylvania...and New Jersey

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 497...

Valid 092043Z - 092245Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 497
continues.

SUMMARY...Convective trends are being monitored for the need for
downstream watch issuance across parts of Maryland, Delaware,
Pennsylvania, and New Jersey as storms spread east through early
evening.

DISCUSSION...Regional radar mosaics continue to show a slow, but
steady, increase in convective coverage across southern PA and parts
of northern MD as lift associated with a mid-level impulse continues
to migrate east and overspreads a moderately buoyant air mass.
Regional VWPs continue to sample 30-40 knot mid-level flow
associated with the upper feature, but the nebulous forcing for
ascent and modest mid-level lapse rates appear to be modulating
convective intensity and longevity of more discrete cells across
PA/MD. While the convective parameter space is supportive of
organized/severe convection, it remains unclear how intense
convection will become over the next few hours. 

Further south into eastern MD and DE, confidence is higher in a
severe wind threat later this evening. A squall line is slowly
organizing across central VA and is expected to continue
intensifying over the next few hours (see recently issued MCD #1619
for additional details). Recent surface observations and MLCAPE
analyses show a plume of rich low-level moisture/buoyancy extending
into southern DE/southeast MD, which should maintain the convective
line as it spreads east into the evening hours. Slow storm motions
cast some uncertainty on exactly when a downstream watch will be
needed, but recent high-res guidance suggest a damaging wind threat
will begin to materialize between 23-01 UTC.

Mesoscale Discussion 1619
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0249 PM CDT Wed Jul 09 2025

Areas affected...Far northern North Carolina into Virginia and
southern Maryland

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 497...

Valid 091949Z - 092145Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 497
continues.

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm intensification is ongoing across northern
North Carolina into Virginia. An increase in damaging/severe wind
potential is expected over the next couple of hours.

DISCUSSION...A leading convective band emanating off the Blue Ridge
Mountains is becoming established from northern VA into far
northwest NC. Latest GOES IR imagery shows rapid cloud-top cooling
associated with several deeper embedded convective cores, signifying
robust intensification. Buoyancy immediately downstream continues to
increase with temperatures warming into the upper 80s/low 90s and
MLCAPE approaching 2500 J/kg as of the 20z RAP mesoanalysis. This
air mass should promote further intensification over the next
several hours and is favorable for strong water-loaded downbursts.
At this point, storm mode should primarily be linear given mean flow
oriented along the developing band. 25-30 knot bulk shear should
support a few embedded surging segments within the line that may
pose a few focused corridors of damaging/severe winds with gusts as
high as 55-65 mph. Latest guidance hints that this potential should
be maximized over the next few hours from the NC/VA border into
central VA.

0248 PM CDT Wed Jul 09 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern Idaho into southern Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 091948Z - 092115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Severe gusts will become an increasing concern as at least
scattered thunderstorms develop and mature through the afternoon. A
Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance may be needed.

DISCUSSION...Deepening CU over eastern ID/southern MT are indicating
attempts at thunderstorm initiation atop a destabilizing boundary
layer with eroding convective inhibition. 19Z mesoanalysis shows
boundary-layer lapse rates already reaching 9 C/km in some spots,
with 500+ J/kg MLCAPE. RAP forecast soundings indicate a dry
boundary layer extending to 500 mb, which is being overspread by
stronger mid-upper level flow and 30 kts of effective bulk shear
(i.e. straight hodographs indicating speed shear). Organized,
high-based multicells should traverse portions of the the northern
Rockies, accompanied by mainly a severe gust threat. If confidence
increases in greater coverage of severe gusts, a Severe Thunderstorm
Watch may be needed.

* Effective this Wednesday afternoon and evening from 200 PM
  until 1000 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Isolated large hail events to 1 inch in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm coverage is expected to increase across the
region this afternoon, with multiple rounds of storms possible.
Moderate buoyancy and vertical shear is expected to support bowing
line segments capable of damaging wind gusts. A few instances of
hail are possible as well, particularly over regions of higher
terrain.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 95
statute miles east and west of a line from 5 miles west northwest of
Hagerstown MD to 60 miles south southwest of Dublin VA. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU7).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1 inch. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A few
cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
27035.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0259 PM CDT Wed Jul 09 2025

Valid 092000Z - 101200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS CENTRAL SOUTH
DAKOTA INTO FAR NORTH-CENTRAL NEBRASKA...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PARTS OF THE
MID-ATLANTIC...SOUTH-CENTRAL MONTANA...

...SUMMARY...
Severe wind gusts and isolated large hail are possible across parts
of the northern/central Plains late this afternoon into evening.
Scattered damaging winds are possible this afternoon to early
evening from parts of the Carolinas to the Mid-Atlantic as well as
over central Montana.

...20Z Update...
No changes have been made to the ongoing forecast. There remains
potential for another focused corridor of severe wind gusts farther
south into central Nebraska this evening. The low-level jet will be
focused in this area. Coverage/organization of storms moving out of
the Nebraska Panhandle remains a question. Confidence is still too
low for a southward expansion of severe wind probabilities.

..Wendt.. 07/09/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1131 AM CDT Wed Jul 09 2025/

...Northern/Central Plains...
A reservoir of ample low-level moisture currently exists from the
central Plains back northwestward into eastern MT, with upper 60s
dewpoints in NE and mid 60s dewpoints as far northwest as DIK in
southwest ND. Steep mid-level lapse rates extend over the
westernmost portions of this greater low-level moisture, which will
support the development of strong to very strong buoyancy later this
afternoon. Thunderstorms are not expected to develop within this
area of strong buoyancy, but instead will likely initiate farther
west (from southeast MT/northeast WY into the NE Panhandle) amid a
combination of weak lee troughing and subtle ascent attendant to
low-amplitude shortwave trough. Here, modest buoyancy, high cloud
bases, and moderate westerly flow aloft will result in
outflow-dominant storm structures which will quickly move into the
more buoyant airmass downstream. Given the ample buoyancy and
moderate vertical shear, updrafts should persist along this
fast-moving outflow, resulting in more progressive convective
clusters. Severe gusts will be possible as these clusters move
eastward/southeastward, with some potential for gusts over 75 mph.
Recent guidance has provided more confidence in higher severe wind
coverage, meriting the introduction of 30% wind probabilities and
southeastward expansion of the 15% wind probabilities past the MO
River in NE/IA.

...Mid-Atlantic/Southeast States...
Recent satellite imagery shows a shortwave trough extending from
southern Ontario through the Lower OH Valley. Morning soundings and
recent mesoanalysis both show moderate mid-level flow (i.e. 30 to 40
kt at 500 mb) throughout the base of this shortwave. Expectation is
for this wave to continue eastward/northeastward through the OH
Valley, reaching the Mid-Atlantic by late afternoon. The airmass
preceding this wave across the Mid-Atlantic is very moist, with
dewpoints ranging from the upper 60s/low 70s from eastern PA/NJ to
the mid 70s across the eastern Carolina. This ample low-level
moisture will result in quick airmass destabilization amid strong
daytime heating. Limited remaining convective inhibition on recent
mesoanalysis indicates this destabilization is already firmly
underway.

Large-scale lift attendant to the approaching shortwave (augmented
by orographic ascent) coupled with airmass destabilization will
result in scattered to numerous thunderstorms development this
afternoon over the southern Appalachians and Blue Ridge Mountains.
This initial, more cellular development could produce isolated hail.
These storms should then spread eastward towards the coast with some
increasing coverage possible. The strongest mid-level flow (and
greatest vertical shear) this afternoon will extend from WV across
northern VA/southern PA and NJ. The greatest buoyancy will be
farther south, across the Carolinas and GA. Even with this
displacement, there is enough overlap between the buoyancy and shear
to support loosely organized strong to severe storms. The highest
concentration of severe storms is anticipated from southeast
PA/southern NJ southward across central VA and the Delmarva into
central NC. In this region, numerous thunderstorms coupled with
moderate shear should result in several cold-pool-dominated,
forward-propagating convective clusters. Damaging gusts will be the
primary risk within this more linear activity.  

...Northern Intermountain West/Rockies and Northern Great Basin...
A shortwave trough is currently moving through northern CA. An
elongated belt of enhanced southwesterly mid-level flow exists from
the base of this shortwave (over northern CA/northwest NV)
northeastward across the northern Great Basin/Rockies. Scattered
thunderstorm development is anticipated within this favorable flow
regime. Daytime heating and steepened low-level lapse rates coupled
with this enhanced mid-level flow should support a strong to severe
wind gusts from parts of eastern Oregon into Idaho/Montana and
possibly northern Utah. Highest coverage is expected over
south-central MT.

...Lower Michigan to northwest Ohio...
Scattered thunderstorms are forecast develop this afternoon beneath
a weak upper trough across parts of Lower Michigan and northwest
Ohio. A modest combination of instability and deep-layer shear will
support isolated/marginally severe hail and locally damaging winds
with the strongest updrafts.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Wed Jul 09 2025

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...Greater Four Corners Region...
A mid-level short wave trough currently over the Great Basin will
shift eastward into the Southern Rockies by Day 2/Friday. Elevated
westerly mid-level flow maxima at the base of trough will overspread
the Greater Four Corners region Friday afternoon. A deep, well-mixed
boundary layer and enhanced mid-level flow will support breezy
west-northwest surface winds and widespread relative humidity of 15
percent or less in the afternoon, resulting in elevated fire weather
conditions for much of the Upper Colorado River Basin and Four
Corners Region.

..Williams.. 07/09/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0156 AM CDT Wed Jul 09 2025/

...Synopsis...
Along the northern periphery of a large-scale ridge over the
Southwest, a midlevel shortwave trough will move eastward from the
Great Basin into the central Rockies. Enhanced westerly flow aloft
accompanying this feature will overspread a deeply mixed boundary
layer during the afternoon. As a result, an expansive area of 15
percent RH and 15-20 mph sustained westerly surface winds will favor
elevated to locally critical fire-weather conditions across the Four
Corners region.

  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development is anticipated over the next few
hours from the western Dakotas down into the Nebraska Panhandle. A
few discrete supercells are possible within this region before
evolving towards a more linear mode with time. One or more
convective lines could then move eastward into more of the central
Dakotas and north-central Nebraska, with strong to severe gusts as
the primary risk. Some gusts over 75 mph are possible.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 85
statute miles east and west of a line from 30 miles northwest of
Bismarck ND to 40 miles southwest of Mullen NE. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 497...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 70 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
28035.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0227 PM CDT Wed Jul 09 2025

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN CENTRAL KS TO
EASTERN IA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible, mainly late afternoon
and evening on Friday, from central Kansas to eastern Iowa.

...Central States...
Primary change this outlook is to add a level 2-SLGT risk for the
most probable corridor of severe storms during the late afternoon
and evening Friday. Have also expanded the longitudinal extent of
the level 1-MRGL in the North-Central States and southward through
the southern High Plains.

A decaying MCS should be ongoing at 12Z Friday in vicinity of IA. An
attendant MCV with this activity may be separate from the mid-level
impulse/low-amplitude shortwave trough that is progged to emerge
onto the central Great Plains Thursday night. A belt of modestly
enhanced mid-level west-southwesterlies ahead of these features will
support semi-organized clustering as renewed convective development
occurs towards peak heating. This is anticipated from along a
retreating large-scale outflow boundary southwestward towards the
dryline mixing into central KS. With ample buoyancy, scattered
severe storms seem possible with damaging wind as the main hazard. 

Isolated severe storms are possible across a much broader region.
Along the synoptic cold front in northern MN to eastern SD,
mid-level flow enhancement should be confined west of the front,
owing to the positive-tilt orientation and compact nature of the
shortwave trough across the southern Canadian Prairies into the
northern Great Plains. Modest mid-level northwesterlies will support
an isolated severe threat across the central/southern High Plains,
with high-based convection in a limited buoyancy environment.

...East...
A low-amplitude mid-level trough will move east from QC to the
Canadian Maritimes. Weak height rises will occur in its wake across
New England. Still, most guidance suggests isolated thunderstorms
will be possible in this region, where moderate effective bulk shear
could support an isolated/marginal wind/hail threat Friday
afternoon.

Farther south, scattered thunderstorms seem probable Friday
afternoon from the DE to Savannah Valleys. Prior days of extensive
convective overturning should temper PW values/storm coverage to an
extent. This suggests wet microburst potential may be subdued.

1224 PM CDT Wed Jul 09 2025

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN THE CENTRAL
GREAT PLAINS AND THE SOUTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
A corridor of scattered damaging winds is possible Thursday
afternoon across a portion of the Southeast. Scattered severe
thunderstorms are possible over parts of the central Great Plains,
mainly from late afternoon through Thursday night.

...Central States...
Much uncertainty plagues this forecast cycle with low predictability
across guidance related to the development/evolution of multiple
MCVs from D1. These MCVs will meander downstream of a low-amplitude
shortwave trough progressing east from the northeast Great Basin
into the central Great Plains on D2. Meanwhile, a positive-tilt
shortwave trough should amplify from the Canadian Rockies into the
southern Prairie Provinces/northern High Plains by early Friday. 

Have expanded level 1-MRGL risk eastward across the Upper MS Valley
for potential diurnal intensification of convection surrounding
remnant MCVs. While confidence is quite low in spatiotemporal
details and the degree of convective coverage, there is adequate
signal across guidance to warrant low-probability severe hail/wind
hazards.

Primary severe potential will likely commence towards peak heating
across the central High Plains ahead of the aforementioned
low-amplitude shortwave trough. Hot/deep-mixed thermodynamic
profiles are expected from southwest/south-central NE southward, as
the dryline reaches central KS. High-based convection in the
post-dryline airmass will offer a threat of sporadic severe gusts.
As convection impinges on a more buoyant airmass downstream, in
tandem with a strengthening low-level jet from the southern High
Plains towards eastern NE, an MCS should develop over NE in the
evening. A downstream warm-advection arc will aid in sustaining this
MCS eastward across a portion of the Mid-MO Valley. A swath of
severe wind gusts with embedded severe hail will be possible
Thursday night. 

Farther north in the northern Great Plains, latest signals are for
broad, low-probability hail/wind threats. The timing of ascent and
strengthening mid/upper-level flow appears delayed until late in the
period ahead of the Canadian Rockies/northern High Plains trough.
Convective coverage should remain isolated during the late afternoon
to early evening along a weak surface front/trough. Modest
deep-layer shear during this timeframe will modulate the overall
threat as well. Greater convective potential should exist overnight
but may largely remain behind the undercutting surface front as it
sharpens southeastward. 

...East...
Weak deep-layer shear will be prevalent across much of the region on
Thursday afternoon, south of modest mid-level westerlies across
NY/New England associated with a low-amplitude shortwave trough over
southeast Canada. Rich boundary-layer moisture will remain prevalent
from the DE Valley southward. This will support a primary threat of
wet microbursts producing erratic damaging winds. Have maintained a
level 2-SLGT risk in a portion of the Southeast for the most
probable corridor of widespread thunderstorms producing localized
damaging winds.

1157 AM CDT Wed Jul 09 2025

Valid 091700Z - 101200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN NEVADA AND FAR WESTERN
UTAH...

...Montana...
A mid-level trough translating east across the Canada/U.S. border
and subsequent breakdown of upper-level ridge over the Northern
Rockies along with sufficient mid-level moisture/instability will
aid in high-based thunderstorm development across the higher terrain
of western MT, moving into eastern MT by evening. Fast
east-northeastward thunderstorm trajectories on the order of 25-30
knots will limit rainfall (in addition to gusty/erratic outflow
winds) over dry fuels, supporting an increased wildfire spread
potential for portions of central and eastern MT where isolated dry
thunderstorm highlights were added.

Otherwise, previous forecast (see below) for additional fire weather
threats across the Western U.S. remains on track with minimal
changes.

..Williams.. 07/09/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0156 AM CDT Wed Jul 09 2025/

...Synopsis...
A compact midlevel trough will advance eastward across the northern
Great Basin during the day. At the same time, a separate large-scale
trough will move eastward across western Canada.

...Great Basin...
Preceding the compact midlevel trough, moderate deep-layer
southwesterly flow will overspread the Great Basin during peak
heating. Deep boundary-layer mixing into this strengthening flow
aloft will result in an expansive area of lower-teens RH and 20-25
mph sustained west-southwesterly surface winds. Given increasingly
dry fuels across the region, critical fire-weather conditions are
expected from central NV into western UT (with elevated conditions
surrounding this area across the Great Basin).

...Northwest...
Large-scale ascent accompanying the compact midlevel trough will aid
in isolated to widely scattered thunderstorm development over
southeastern OR, southwestern ID, and far northeastern CA during the
afternoon/evening hours. Deep inverted-V soundings and 0.5-0.7 inch
PW will favor dry thunderstorms -- with a risk of lightning-induced
ignitions and strong/erratic outflow winds. 

Additionally, strong westerly flow in the base of the large-scale
trough moving across western Canada will persist across the
Cascades. Despite slightly higher RH than previous days, strong
downslope/westerly surface winds will favor elevated to locally
critical fire-weather conditions in the Columbia Basin.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS CENTRAL
SD AND FAR NORTH-CENTRAL NE AND SOUTH-CENTRAL MT...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PARTS OF THE
MID-ATLANTIC STATES AND CAROLINAS...

...SUMMARY...
Severe wind gusts and isolated large hail are possible across parts
of the northern/central Plains late this afternoon into evening.
Scattered damaging winds are possible this afternoon to early
evening from parts of the Carolinas to the Mid-Atlantic as well as
over central Montana.

...Northern/Central Plains...
A reservoir of ample low-level moisture currently exists from the
central Plains back northwestward into eastern MT, with upper 60s
dewpoints in NE and mid 60s dewpoints as far northwest as DIK in
southwest ND. Steep mid-level lapse rates extend over the
westernmost portions of this greater low-level moisture, which will
support the development of strong to very strong buoyancy later this
afternoon. Thunderstorms are not expected to develop within this
area of strong buoyancy, but instead will likely initiate farther
west (from southeast MT/northeast WY into the NE Panhandle) amid a
combination of weak lee troughing and subtle ascent attendant to
low-amplitude shortwave trough. Here, modest buoyancy, high cloud
bases, and moderate westerly flow aloft will result in
outflow-dominant storm structures which will quickly move into the
more buoyant airmass downstream. Given the ample buoyancy and
moderate vertical shear, updrafts should persist along this
fast-moving outflow, resulting in more progressive convective
clusters. Severe gusts will be possible as these clusters move
eastward/southeastward, with some potential for gusts over 75 mph.
Recent guidance has provided more confidence in higher severe wind
coverage, meriting the introduction of 30% wind probabilities and
southeastward expansion of the 15% wind probabilities past the MO
River in NE/IA.

...Mid-Atlantic/Southeast States...
Recent satellite imagery shows a shortwave trough extending from
southern Ontario through the Lower OH Valley. Morning soundings and
recent mesoanalysis both show moderate mid-level flow (i.e. 30 to 40
kt at 500 mb) throughout the base of this shortwave. Expectation is
for this wave to continue eastward/northeastward through the OH
Valley, reaching the Mid-Atlantic by late afternoon. The airmass
preceding this wave across the Mid-Atlantic is very moist, with
dewpoints ranging from the upper 60s/low 70s from eastern PA/NJ to
the mid 70s across the eastern Carolina. This ample low-level
moisture will result in quick airmass destabilization amid strong
daytime heating. Limited remaining convective inhibition on recent
mesoanalysis indicates this destabilization is already firmly
underway.

Large-scale lift attendant to the approaching shortwave (augmented
by orographic ascent) coupled with airmass destabilization will
result in scattered to numerous thunderstorms development this
afternoon over the southern Appalachians and Blue Ridge Mountains.
This initial, more cellular development could produce isolated hail.
These storms should then spread eastward towards the coast with some
increasing coverage possible. The strongest mid-level flow (and
greatest vertical shear) this afternoon will extend from WV across
northern VA/southern PA and NJ. The greatest buoyancy will be
farther south, across the Carolinas and GA. Even with this
displacement, there is enough overlap between the buoyancy and shear
to support loosely organized strong to severe storms. The highest
concentration of severe storms is anticipated from southeast
PA/southern NJ southward across central VA and the Delmarva into
central NC. In this region, numerous thunderstorms coupled with
moderate shear should result in several cold-pool-dominated,
forward-propagating convective clusters. Damaging gusts will be the
primary risk within this more linear activity.  

...Northern Intermountain West/Rockies and Northern Great Basin...
A shortwave trough is currently moving through northern CA. An
elongated belt of enhanced southwesterly mid-level flow exists from
the base of this shortwave (over northern CA/northwest NV)
northeastward across the northern Great Basin/Rockies. Scattered
thunderstorm development is anticipated within this favorable flow
regime. Daytime heating and steepened low-level lapse rates coupled
with this enhanced mid-level flow should support a strong to severe
wind gusts from parts of eastern Oregon into Idaho/Montana and
possibly northern Utah. Highest coverage is expected over
south-central MT.

...Lower Michigan to northwest Ohio...
Scattered thunderstorms are forecast develop this afternoon beneath
a weak upper trough across parts of Lower Michigan and northwest
Ohio. A modest combination of instability and deep-layer shear will
support isolated/marginally severe hail and locally damaging winds
with the strongest updrafts.

Valid 091300Z - 101200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
MID-ATLANTIC STATES/CAROLINAS AND NORTHERN/CENTRAL PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered damaging winds are possible this afternoon to early
evening from parts of the Carolinas to the Mid-Atlantic. Large hail
and severe wind gusts are also possible across parts of the
northern/central Plains late this afternoon into evening.

...Mid-Atlantic/Southeast States...
A weak mid-level trough will move slowly eastward today across the
Great Lakes and Ohio Valley. A belt of modestly enhanced
southwesterly mid-level flow will remain over the Mid-Atlantic
through this evening, diminishing with southward extent in the
Southeast. Scattered to numerous thunderstorms are once again
expected to develop this afternoon over the southern Appalachians
and Blue Ridge Mountains, and then spread eastward towards the
coast. Steepening low-level lapse rates and rich low-level moisture
will support MLCAPE generally around 1500-3000 J/kg across lower
elevations. 

Loosely organized clusters may eventually develop from parts of
Virginia towards the DelMarVa Peninsula and vicinity owing to
somewhat more favorable deep-layer shear across these regions.
Isolated hail may occur initially with the more cellular/discrete
convection, before scattered severe/damaging winds becomes the
primary risk with eastward extent as multiple clusters potentially
develop.

...Northern/central Plains...
Downstream of a low-amplitude mid-level ridge emanating from an
upper-level anticyclone over the Southwest, most guidance continues
to suggest that isolated to scattered thunderstorms should form by
late this afternoon along a weak surface trough. However, it should
be noted that guidance continues to vary considerably in the
short-term spatial details, likely owing to owing to degree of
elevated mixed layer/warmth aloft. Recent HRRR (and RRFS) runs are
somewhat uncharacteristically more aggressive (given the capping and
modest forcing regime etc.) in terms of overall degree of deep
convective development and the southward extent thereof, as compared
to various global guidance.

A corridor of strong to very strong instability will exist by late
afternoon/early evening from parts of western/central Dakotas to
northern Nebraska, aided by daytime heating and very steep lapse
rates. Despite modest mid-level west-northwesterlies owing to the
proximity of the upper ridge, stronger upper-level westerlies will
support adequate deep-layer shear for a few supercells initially,
with associated threat for large to isolated very large hail.
Outflow-dominated downdrafts should foster clustering
east-southeastward across the Dakotas and parts of Nebraska, with a
risk for severe-caliber wind gusts, some of which could be 75+ mph
on an isolated basis given the rather favorable thermodynamic
environment forecast. Risk-magnitude uncertainty increases southward
across Kansas, but at least isolated severe storms may occur across
western/central/northern parts of Kansas, and possibly into northern
Oklahoma. 

...Northern Intermountain West/Rockies and northern Great Basin...
Downstream of a shortwave trough moving eastward toward the northern
Great Basin, an elongated belt of enhanced southwesterly mid-level
flow will exist across the northern Great Basin/Rockies. Within this
favorable flow regime amid steepened low-level lapse rates through
daytime heating, scattered thunderstorms should foster strong to
isolated severe wind gusts from parts of eastern Oregon into
Idaho/Montana and possibly northern Utah.

...Lower Michigan to northwest Ohio...
Isolated/marginally severe hail and locally damaging winds may occur
this afternoon across parts of Lower Michigan and northwest
Ohio. This will be as scattered thunderstorms develop beneath a weak
upper trough, supported by a modest combination of instability and
deep-layer shear.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0318 AM CDT Wed Jul 09 2025

Valid 121200Z - 171200Z

...DISCUSSION...
The overall large-scale pattern looks to remain characterized by
mid-to-upper-level ridging across the western United States with a
zonal to broadly cyclonic flow across the northern tier of the US
through the forecast period. At the same time, rich/moist low-level
moisture looks to remain entrenched across much of the eastern US,
sustained in part by broad, southerly flow, albeit with some
fluctuations in raw values. Global models continue to be bullish on
a seasonably strong cold front pushing south through much of the
central US late in the forecast period, ushering in a cooler/drier
airmass.

Strong-to-locally severe thunderstorms will be possible somewhere
across the eastern CONUS every day of the forecast period. However,
with synoptic-scale forcing/dynamics primarily constrained to
Canada, most thunderstorms will be determined by
sub-synoptic/mesoscale details dictated by/reinforced with each
prior day's convection. Thus, confidence is too low in any one
location on any given day to introduce unconditional severe
probabilities at this time. 

However, some areas/scenarios of interest to monitor include the
southern Great Plains on Days 4-5/Saturday-Sunday as a moist, weakly
capped environment will exist in proximity to an increasing diffuse
surface boundary. Other areas include the East Coast most afternoons
and the along and ahead of seasonably strong cold front pushing
south through the Great Plains from Days 6-8.

For each of the areas of interest/scenarios of interest above, weak
effective-layer shear stemming from generally weak tropospheric flow
will be a limiting factor for a more organized severe potential and
confidence to introduce unconditional probabilities.

Mesoscale Discussion 1608
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0257 PM CDT Tue Jul 08 2025

Areas affected...portions of northeast Wisconsin and the UP of
Michigan

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 081957Z - 082130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong to severe storms may pose a risk for
damaging gusts and some hail this afternoon. A WW is not
anticipated.

DISCUSSION...Across portions of the upper Great Lakes, isolated
thunderstorms have developed along a weak front/wind shift this
afternoon.  Aided by weak ascent from a broad shortwave trough,
additional storm development/maturation is possible over the next
few hours. Warming surface temperatures and 60s F dewpoints were
supporting ~1000 J/kg of MCLAPE. Sufficient for strong updrafts,
35-40 kt of flow aloft will also favor some organization with
supercell structures or clusters. Isolated damaging gusts and some
hail are possible with the strongest storms.

The environment should continue to support occasional strong to
severe storms over the next few hours as the wind shift continues
toward the western shores of Lake Michigan. HRRR guidance suggests
additional storms are possible farther south into northern WI with
time. However, the limited overlap of buoyancy and shear, plus the
limited duration before crossing offshore suggests the overall
severe potential is low. A WW is unlikely, though convective trends
will be monitored.

Mesoscale Discussion 1607
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0232 PM CDT Tue Jul 08 2025

Areas affected...Portions of the Mid-Atlantic

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 496...

Valid 081932Z - 082130Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 496
continues.

SUMMARY...A line of thunderstorms is showing signs of
intensification; the damaging wind potential is expected to increase
over the coming hours as the line of storms approaches the I-95
corridor.

DISCUSSION...Latest GOES IR imagery shows steady cloud-top cooling
of individual cells embedded within a developing convective band as
convection begins moving off of the higher terrain and into a very
buoyant air mass in place downstream across the Mid-Atlantic. Latest
RAP mesoanalysis estimates suggest that MLCAPE ahead of the
developing line has increased to around 2500 J/kg as surface
temperatures warm into the mid 90s. Additionally, regional VWPs are
sampling 20-30 knot mid-level winds, which is supporting slightly
stronger deep-layer bulk shear values than depicted by recent
RAP/mesoanalysis estimates, which should contribute to better
organization and longevity of the developing band. Consequently, the
intensification trend is expected to continue as storms spread east
over the next few hours. As this occurs, the potential for
damaging/severe winds should also increase as cold pool
consolidation/organization continues. Recent storm track estimates
suggest that this activity should reach the I-95 corridor roughly
during the 20-22 UTC time frame, which should be when diurnal
heating and MLCAPE magnitudes will be maximized.

Areas affected...south-central Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 072028Z - 072200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated storms capable of large hail/damaging winds
expected to to continue. Watch issuance is possible but remains
uncertain in the short term.

DISCUSSION...Visible satellite/radar shows a few isolated storms
that have developed during peak heating amid a very unstable
airmass, characterized by MLCAPE values nearing 3000 J/kg. Deep
layer shear has remained somewhat marginal thus far, perhaps
approaching 30-35 kt, but is forecast to increase with time. Thus,
storms should exhibit supercell characteristics, with large hail and
damaging winds the primary threats. Southeasterly low-level flow is
promoting at least some elongation of hodographs, but low-level
shear remains weak in general. Thus, the tornado threat appears low
but cannot be ruled out. These storms are expected to remain
isolated, and thus, watch issuance is not anticipated in the short
term. However, convective trends will be monitored should a watch be
needed for the region.

Mesoscale Discussion 1594
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0303 PM CDT Mon Jul 07 2025

Areas affected...Far northeast New York...northern Vermont and New
Hampshire...and into central Maine

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 072003Z - 072200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong thunderstorms may pose a severe wind/hail
risk through the afternoon and early evening hours. This threat is
expected to remain sufficiently isolated to preclude watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...Latest regional radar imagery shows a gradual
maturation of convection across far northeast NY and across central
ME along/ahead of a cold front. Temperatures warming into the low
80s with dewpoints in the upper 60s to low 70s is slowly eroding
inhibition with MLCAPE increasing to around 500-1000 J/kg region
wide. This warming trend should continue and will promote further
thunderstorm intensification over the next couple of hours. 30-40
knot mid-level winds in proximity to a weakening upper trough are
supporting sufficient hodograph elongation for organized convection.
While convective mode will likely transition to predominantly a
semi-organized convective band due to strong flow along the
initiating cold front, an initial supercell or two appears possible
and may pose a severe hail/wind risk through the afternoon -
especially across central ME where forcing for ascent is currently
more nebulous. With time, strong to severe winds should become the
predominant hazard as a band of storms begins to emerge. Despite
these concerns, the overall severe threat is expected to remain
sufficiently isolated to preclude watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1593
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0255 PM CDT Mon Jul 07 2025

Areas affected...eastern North Dakota and northwest Minnesota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 071955Z - 072200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Large hail, damaging winds, and perhaps a tornado are
possible this afternoon/evening. Watch issuance is possible.

DISCUSSION...Regional satellite/radar show convection developing
along a cold front positioned from northeast North Dakota extending
southwestward, and along a warm front extending into northeast
Minnesota. This activity is developing in a region where skies have
remained clear in proximity to passing cirrus clouds to the
immediate south. In addition, cool mid-level temperatures are
overspreading the region, in association with an upper-level trough.
These factors are contributing to destabilization that is yielding
MLCAPE values near 1500 J/kg. Ample effective shear of 40-45 kt is
also present, associated with the aforementioned trough.

Storms are expected to continue increasing in coverage and severity
throughout the afternoon and into the evening. Large hail and
damaging wind gusts will be the primary threats. A tornado will also
be possible with any storm that can favorably interact with
aforementioned warm front. Coverage of storms remains uncertain in
the short term, given the extent of the cirrus shield limiting
destabilization. However, at least some CAM solutions suggest
greater coverage may materialize. Thus, convective trends will be
monitored for possible watch issuance this afternoon/evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 1592
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0223 PM CDT Mon Jul 07 2025

Areas affected...northeast Colorado...far southeast
Wyoming...southwest Nebraska...and northwest Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 071923Z - 072130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered severe storms expected by mid/late afternoon,
posing a threat for severe wind/hail. Watch possible.

DISCUSSION...Visible satellite show a broad area of terrain
generated convection over the mountains of central/northern Colorado
into far southeast Wyoming. Additional convection is now forming
downstream of this activity, along the lee of the Rockies. Clear
skies have promoted strong insolation amid a relatively moist
low-level airmass for the central High Plains, with dew point
temperatures in the mid/upper 50s F. This is contributing to an
west-to-east instability gradient, with MLCAPE values approaching
1500 J/kg in far northeast Colorado. Surface observations also
indicate a weak upslope flow regime in this region in advance of a
stalling cold front across the panhandle of Nebraska.

The aforementioned convection should continue to develop and
propagate eastward off the high terrain with time. As this occurs,
storms will encounter greater instability as MLCAPE values are
forecast to approach 2000-2500 J/kg. Effective shear is forecast to
increase throughout the afternoon/evening, approaching 35-45 kt.
This will help to promote storm organization into
supercell/multicell modes, with damaging winds and severe hail
expected. With time, cold pools may promote upscale growth into an
MCS this evening, transitioning into more of a damaging wind threat.
Given this potential, the area is being monitored for possible watch
issuance this afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1582

0344 PM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025

Areas affected...north-central North Carolina into far southern
Virginia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 062044Z - 062215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A brief tornado or strong wind gust will remain possible
with the convection near the remnant core of TD Chantal.

DISCUSSION...Afternoon imagery shows the remnants of TD Chantal
located across portions of north-central NC near 34.4 deg N 79.2 deg
W. Within the broader precip shield, a few deeper convective towers
have remained strong with occasional cyclonic rotation observed.
Enhanced low-level shear (0-1km SRH near 200 m2/s2) near the remnant
center will remain strong enough to support occasional low-level
mesocyclones with this convection. Despite weak buoyancy (MLCAPE
(~500 J/kg) the moist surface environment and some deeper storms may
remain capable of a brief tornado two and damaging gust into this
evening. Widespread severe weather is not anticipated, and the
interaction of the circulation with higher terrain to the west
should slowly limit the threat tonight.

Mesoscale Discussion 1581
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0326 PM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025

Areas affected...portions of northern Maine

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 062026Z - 062200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated to widely scattered thunderstorms, including a
few supercells, may pose a risk for damaging gusts and small hail
this afternoon/evening. A WW is unlikely.

DISCUSSION...As of 2020 UTC, regional radar and satellite imagery
showed convection was strengthening across portions of Maine. As
temperatures have warmed into the upper 70s to low 80s, around 1000
J/kg of MLCAPE has developed with dewpoints in the 60s. While not
overly strong, this buoyancy should continue to support occasional
stronger updrafts with convection across the region. Deep-layer
shear is supportive of storm organization with the KCBW VAD showing
an elongated hodograph and 30-45 kt of bulk shear. Weak mid-level
rotation has already been observed and the environment suggests a
few supercell/organized multi cell structures are possible. With
poor lapse rates and relatively limited buoyancy, damaging gusts
still appear to be the primary risk. However, some small hail and a
brief tornado are possible with the stronger rotating storms.

HRRR guidance and observations suggests additional storm
development/intensification is plausible this afternoon with more
storms developing/moving in from eastern Canada this evening. While
some severe risk is possible, confidence in severe coverage is low
owing to weak forcing and limited buoyancy. Convective trends are
being monitored, but a WW is currently unlikely.

Mesoscale Discussion 1580
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0218 PM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025

Areas affected...Eastern New Mexico

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 061918Z - 062145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms emanating off the southern Rockies will pose
an isolated severe wind/hail threat through the late afternoon and
early evening hours. Watch issuance is not expected.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm development within the Sangre de Cristo
and Sacramento mountains is evident in recent GOES imagery. Weak
mid-level flow over the region will likely result in slow storm
propagation off the higher terrain, but as this occurs storms will
eventually move into an unseasonably moist air mass downstream
(dewpoint values in the 75th-90th percentile for early July). This
moisture is contributing to around 1000-1500 J/kg MLCAPE that should
promote thunderstorm maintenance, and possibly intensification,
through late evening. A combination of semi-discrete cells and
propagating clusters is expected with an attendant threat for
isolated large hail (most likely near/below 1.25 inch in diameter)
and sporadic severe wind gusts. The overall severe threat is
expected to remain relatively isolated given the modest kinematic
environment, which should preclude the need for watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1578
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0138 PM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025

Areas affected...Northeast Colorado to southeast Wyoming and western
Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 061838Z - 062115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms developing within the higher terrain of the
central Rockies will spread east and intensify through the
afternoon. As this occurs, the threat for severe winds, and possibly
large hail, will increase. Watch issuance is probable later this
afternoon as thunderstorms increase in coverage and intensity.

DISCUSSION...Latest GOES imagery and lightning data shows a gradual
uptick in convection within the higher terrain of central to
northern CO and far southern WY as daytime heating drives increasing
orographic ascent within a weakly capped air mass. This initial
activity is expected to spread east into the High Plains over the
coming hours given 30-40 knot westerly flow within the CAPE-bearing
layer. Storm intensification is expected as convection overspreads a
relatively moist low-level air mass (dewpoints remain in the mid to
upper 50s downstream) and as lingering inhibition is removed via
deepening boundary-layer heating/mixing. 

Across southeast WY and western NE, slightly stronger zonal flow
aloft coupled with weak easterly low-level winds should promote
adequate deep-layer shear for a couple of supercells with an
attendant large hail risk (possibly up to 2 inches in diameter). The
tornado threat may also be locally greatest across this region due
to augmented low-level shear/SRH on the immediate cool side of a
residual outflow boundary emanating out of central NE.

Further south across CO, observed dewpoint depressions and
short-term forecast soundings suggest LCL heights should approach
2.5 to 3 km as temperatures warm into the upper 80s, which will
promote strong downdraft evaporative cooling and accelerations as
well as rapid cold pool production. Strong to severe downburst winds
and sporadic large hail appear likely within initially discrete
cells moving off the terrain and/or developing within the DCVZ, but
upscale growth into organized clusters is anticipated later this
afternoon/evening with a more widespread severe wind risk (with
gusts possibly as high as 70-80 mph). Watch issuance is probable as
these threats begin to emerge in the coming hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 1575
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0751 AM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025

Areas affected...east North Carolina

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 061251Z - 061515Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A marginal increase in tornado potential may occur this
morning as Tropical Storm Chantal continues to move inland. The
overall tornado potential should remain low enough to preclude the
need for a TC-related Tornado Watch. However, trends will be
monitored.

DISCUSSION...A marginal increase in tornado potential may occur this
morning as Tropical Storm Chantal continues to move inland. This
marginal increase would coincide with modest diurnal heating
increasing and several feeder bands streaming inland on the eastern
semicircle of Chantal. The onshore environment containing these
feeder bands has little instability at present and the low-level
storm-relative helicity is on the lower side of land-falling
tropical cyclones. That said, the low-level storm-relative helicity
still remains sufficient for low-level rotation with stronger
thunderstorm updrafts. Present thinking is that the limited
instability and modest low-level helicity should preclude any longer
duration/larger area tornado threat and thus a TC-related tornado
watch is not currently anticipated. However, trends will continue to
be evaluated for increasing buoyancy and/or low-level helicity.

Mesoscale Discussion 1574
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0714 AM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025

Areas affected...southwest South Dakota and north-central Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 061214Z - 061415Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Ongoing thunderstorms should persist for another couple of
hours before weakening. Isolated hail and a damaging wind gust or
two will remain possible in the near term. A watch is not currently
expected.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms continue this morning across southwest
South Dakota along the southwest portion of a remnant MCS that moved
across this region overnight. These thunderstorms appear to be
driven by isentropic ascent focused atop a residual cold pool left
over from the overnight convection. This shows up as strong warm-air
advection centered around 700 MB in regional mesoanalysis.
Mesoanalysis also indicates a rich CAPE reservoir to the southwest
of the ongoing storms, within the thunderstorm source/inflow region,
providing additional buoyancy. With time, diurnal heating should
begin to modify the existing cold pool and weaken the isentropic
ascent/WAA leading to a downward trend in thunderstorm intensity.
Before this weakening occurs, lapse rates do not appear particular
steep this morning per RAP-model forecast soundings, and an
isotherms layer extends upward from the surface to around 800 mb.
This should limit the severe potential to isolated hail and perhaps
a damaging wind gust or two -- realistically only in the most
intense cores.

A watch is not anticipated.
