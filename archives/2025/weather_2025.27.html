Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0730 AM CDT Sun Jul 13 2025

Valid 131300Z - 141200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
NORTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible today through early
tonight in the Upper Midwest, Mid-Atlantic/Northeast, Southwest,
south-central Texas to the Lower Ohio Valley, and Florida.

...Northeast/Mid-Atlantic States...
Glancingly influenced by the Great Lakes/Ontario/western Quebec
upper-level trough, pre-frontal convergence/terrain will contribute
to scattered thunderstorm development into this afternoon within a
moist air mass. Most storms will tend to remain disorganized/pulse
in nature across the Mid-Atlantic. However, modestly stronger
mid-level southwesterlies could support some sustained multicells
particularly across central/northern portions of New York and
Pennsylvania, where a Slight Risk appears warranted for a somewhat
focused corridor of severe storm potential. Wind/tree damage will be
the primary hazard regionally.

...Florida...
With the mid-level anticyclone becoming centered along the central
Gulf Coast, weak northerly flow will dominate much of the state,
with scattered afternoon thunderstorm development expected to be
most prominent across the eastern half of the Peninsula. Amid
2000-3000 J/kg MLCAPE and high PW values yielding melting small
hail, localized marginal severe gusts in wet microbursts will be
possible from mid-afternoon to early evening.

...Mid-South/Lower Ohio Valley...
One or more MCVs should persist generally eastward across the
Ozarks, potentially maintaining a modestly enhanced mid/low-level
flow field through the diurnal heating cycle. This could influence
organized storms this afternoon through early evening, potentially
including a few supercells and linear segments. Damaging winds will
be possible, and brief tornado potential cannot be ruled out.

...South-central/East Texas...
A nearly-stationary MCS is ongoing this morning across south-central
Texas with a primary threat of flash flooding (see WPC EROs/MPDs for
details). Potential MCV influences and composite outflow and
differential heating may contribute to strong/severe thunderstorm
development into peak heating, mainly on the southern/eastern
periphery of the early morning MCS. Isolated wet microbursts capable
of wind damage would be the most probable severe hazard aside from
rainfall-related aspects. 

...Upper Midwest...
In the wake of a mid-level trough passage this morning, a strong
mid-level jetlet will shift across the southern Prairie Provinces.
Guidance consensus indicates a low-amplitude 700-mb trough should
shift southeast ahead of the aforementioned jetlet in the eastern
Dakotas to western Minnesota by late afternoon. This should aid in
strengthening convergence along a progressive surface trough
approaching northeast Minnesota to the Mid-Missouri Valley. The
northwest flow setup will yield favorable hodograph structure for
potential discrete supercells and large hail production. But modest
mid-level lapse rates and a confined weak to moderate buoyancy
plume, largely driven by evapotranspiration ahead of the front,
should modulate overall storm intensity/coverage. Isolated large
hail/severe gusts from a few widely spaced supercells seem plausible
from late afternoon until around sunset.

...Southwest...
As a mid-level anticyclone becomes centered over the southern Great
Basin, modest northerlies will dominate across northern New Mexico,
turning to easterlies over southeast Arizona. Widespread storms are
expected to develop off the higher terrain and slowly progress south
to west from mid-afternoon to mid-evening. With a gradient in
buoyancy from northwest to southeast, larger over the southern High
Plains, isolated severe hail will be possible over New Mexico.
Otherwise, isolated severe gusts should be the primary threat into
southeast Arizona.

Mesoscale Discussion 1658
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0329 PM CDT Sat Jul 12 2025

Areas affected...Parts of southern IN...southwest
OH...northern/western KY...far southern IL/southeast MO

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 122029Z - 122200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Locally damaging wind will remain possible through late
afternoon.

DISCUSSION...A compact storm cluster is moving quickly eastward
across southern IN and adjacent western KY late this afternoon.
While convection associated with this cluster is not particularly
well-organized, it has a history of producing localized near-severe
gusts, and also has a relatively strong cold pool. Strong downstream
heating has resulted in MLCAPE increasing above 2500 J/kg and
steepening low-level lapse rates. Deep-layer shear is weak, but
given the favorable buoyancy and presence of a propagating cold
pool, some threat for isolated damaging wind may accompany this
storm cluster as it continues to move eastward. 

Other strong storms are ongoing across parts of western/central OH,
and also along the trailing outflow into far western KY into
southern IL and southeast MO. These storms will be capable of
producing localized damaging downburst winds, given favorable
buoyancy and large PW.

Mesoscale Discussion 1657
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0235 PM CDT Sat Jul 12 2025

Areas affected...central Texas and the Texas Hill Country

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 121935Z - 122130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Widespread thunderstorms will be capable of sporadic
damaging gusts and small hail this afternoon/evening. A WW is not
anticipated.

DISCUSSION...Across portions of west-central TX, numerous
thunderstorms have redeveloped/intensified ahead of a weak cold
front and MCV. Strong diurnal heating of a very moist air mass
(dewpoints in the mid 70s F) is supporting moderate destabilization
despite poor mid-level lapse rates. Numerous thunderstorms with
occasional stronger updrafts are expected. Deep-layer shear is weak
with flow aloft generally blow 20 kt. This should keep storm
organization transient at best. Still, deep, saturated thermodynamic
profiles and PWATS near 1.8-2 inches will favor heavily water-loaded
downdrafts in these storms. This could support sporadic damaging
gusts with wet microbursts, along with small hail and localized
torrential rainfall rates (see WPC MPD: #0660).

Severe potential will be maximized where storm coverage is highest.
This is most likely ahead of the MCV and along the sagging front
across central TX and the western Hill Country. As downdrafts
intensify, gradually consolidation into more persistent clusters
that spread eastward with time is likely. While some severe risk is
possible, the negligible deep-layer shear and localized risk for
damaging gusts and hail suggests a severe watch is unlikely.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0300 PM CDT Sat Jul 12 2025

Valid 122000Z - 131200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PARTS OF THE
LOWER/MIDDLE OHIO VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe storms capable of damaging winds are possible
across parts of the Lower/Middle Ohio Valley through sunset.

...20Z Update...
The primary change to the ongoing forecast was to remove severe
probabilities from lower Michigan where the airmass has become more
stable behind the surface front. Elsewhere, minor changes were made
base on current observations. Please see the previous forecast for
additional details.

..Wendt.. 07/12/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1123 AM CDT Sat Jul 12 2025/

...Lower MI into Lower/Mid OH Valley...
Recent surface analysis shows a pre-frontal wind shift from central
Lower MI southwestward through central IN. The cold front itself is
a bit farther west, extending across western Lower MI through far
northwest IN and southern IL, although the temperature gradient is a
bit diffuse. Additionally, satellite imagery shows a series of
gravity waves ahead of the pre-frontal wind shift. These waves have
aided in the development of thunderstorms over northern Lower MI and
farther south in south-central MI. This complex pattern coupled with
cloudiness results in uncertainty regarding the overall convective
evolution across the region today. 

The highest severe thunderstorm potential still appears to be across
north-central/northeast Lower MI, where recent mesoanalysis places a
belt of stronger low-level flow. This is verified by the APX VAD,
which has recently sampled 30 to 40 kt between 1 and 2 km. Upper 60s
to low 70s dewpoints are in place over the region, and mesoanalysis
already estimates minimal convective inhibition with MLCAPE from
1000 to 1500 J/kg. Some filtered heating is ongoing as well, with
instability expected to increase through the early afternoon ahead
of the approaching front. As mentioned in recently issued MCD #1654,
there may be a window of opportunity early afternoon this for
supercell development along/ahead of the front, especially across
northeast lower MI. Any such development would pose a threat of
damaging wind, isolated hail, and possibly a tornado. Otherwise,
multicell clusters and perhaps a transient supercell or two will
become increasingly possible into this afternoon, with a primary
threat of damaging wind.

Farther south, lift along the front combined with mesoscale ascent
attendant to the convective cluster currently over far southeast MO 
should result in afternoon thunderstorm development from southern
IL/far western KY into much of IN. Strong buoyancy is expected ahead
of the front, but shear will be weaker, with a less organized storm
mode anticipated. Even so, given the number of storms anticipated, a
few convective clusters capable of damaging gusts are possible. This
risk should shift eastward into OH and KY before storm weaken this
evening.

...Southern Plains into the Ozarks...
A triplet of MCVs is apparent in recent satellite imagery, with one
MCV over southwest KS, another over the far eastern TX Panhandle,
and the last over the TX South Plains. Thunderstorm development is
possible with each of these features, particularly the one moving
eastward out of the eastern TX Panhandle into western/central OK.
Storms will likely diurnally increase and intensify this afternoon
across much of OK and a large part of north TX. Shear will be weak
across much of the region, except near the MCV where some
low/mid-level flow enhancement is possible. This could result in a
few more organized updrafts across north-central/central OK. Even
so, deep-layer flow will remain modest, which is expected to limit
the overall severe coverage.

...Colorado/New Mexico...
Thunderstorm development is again anticipated over the higher
terrain of central CO and north-central NM this afternoon. Modestly
enhanced mid/upper-level north-northwesterlies should aid in
weak/transient updraft rotation, supporting the potential for
isolated severe hail. The airmass across the CO Plains is not
expected to be as favorable for storm persistence as the last few
days, suggesting the threat for strong gusts is lower. The airmass
is a bit more favorable across NM, suggesting a relatively greater
chance of a few severe across the NM High Plains.

...WI into Upper MI...
Isolated severe hail/damaging winds may also develop along the
secondary cold front advancing eastward across northern/eastern
WI and Upper MI. Cooling mid-level temperatures will aid in weak
MLCAPE of 500-1000 J/kg this afternoon. Westerly low-level wind
profiles will modulate the degree of deep-layer shear, helping to
marginalize the overall threat.

...Mid-South/Tennessee Valley to the Carolinas/Virginia...
A pulse storm environment characterized by weak effective bulk shear
but moderate buoyancy will support a threat for isolated wet
microbursts from mid-afternoon to early evening, with tree damage
possible.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0250 PM CDT Sat Jul 12 2025

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...Columbia Basin...
Westerly downslope winds and drying east of the Cascades will bring
elevated fire weather conditions to the Columbia Basin Sunday amid
dry fuels, with stronger sustained winds of up to 20 mph
concentrated through the Cascade gaps. 

...Northern CA/Southern OR/central ID...
A subtle mid-level short wave trough along with strong daytime
heating but marginal instability over the higher terrain will
support a few showers and thunderstorms across northern California
into south-central OR Sunday afternoon. Farther northeast, another
weak mid-level short wave trough could bring few high-based
showers/thunderstorms over higher terrain of central Idaho. Coverage
of thunderstorms will be quite sparse with weak forcing and limited
mid-level moisture, limiting threat of dry lightning ignitions
across central ID.

..Williams.. 07/12/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1218 AM CDT Sat Jul 12 2025/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level shortwave will move across the periphery of the western
ridge on Sunday. This will bring an increase in westerly winds
across the Cascades in central Washington and Oregon. Winds will
largely remain Elevated (at around 10-15 mph) but some locally
Critical conditions will be possible in the Cascade gaps. Fuels in
this region are critically dry, with ERCs exceeding the 90th
percentile for dryness.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0159 PM CDT Sat Jul 12 2025

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms are possible across portions
of the northern Plains Monday evening.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
A belt of moderate flow aloft will generally extend eastward along
U.S./Canadian border on Monday, with weaker flow and higher heights
across the remainder of the CONUS. Models do depict a positive-tilt
trough dropping south across the Pacific Northwest and into MT, with
increasing large-scale ascent favoring increasing rain and
thunderstorm chances late.

A surface trough will deepen from eastern WA into southern MT and
into western SD late Monday, ahead of the elongated west-east
oriented cold front. Dewpoints in the 50s F will exist both near and
behind the front from central MT into the Dakotas, contributing to
MUCAPE over 1000 J/kg. Weak to moderate deep-layer effective shear
near the front may yield a few storms capable of severe gusts as
activity pushes south into the heated air mass south of the
boundary. Otherwise, elevated/marginal hail may occur as well. A
nocturnal low-level jet may support strong to locally severe storms
into parts of northern MN overnight.

Elsewhere, an expansive area of low-level moisture will remain from
the Plains to the East coast, beneath generally weak flow aloft.
This will support scattered storms, though any severe wind potential
should be quite localized.

1222 PM CDT Sat Jul 12 2025

Valid 121700Z - 131200Z

...Eastern Montana...
Enhanced northwesterly mid-level flow coinciding with the passage of
a surface trough and associated tightening pressure gradient will
support breezy northwest winds of 15-25 mph today across portions of
eastern Montana this afternoon. Daytime relative humidity as low as
15 percent combined with the steady northwest wind will present an
elevated fire weather threat amid dry fuels across the area.

..Williams.. 07/12/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1217 AM CDT Sat Jul 12 2025/

...Synopsis...
High pressure across the western US will continue to keep winds
mainly light and terrain driven where fuels are the driest Saturday.
Moisture will increase across west-central Colorado, with PWs
approaching 0.60-0.75". A mix of initially dry/wet thunderstorms
will be possible, though the dry thunderstorm risk should remain too
localized to include areas with this outlook.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM CENTRAL
VIRGINIA INTO PARTS OF NEW YORK...AND ROUGHLY FROM THE OZARKS INTO
NORTHWEST TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Marginally severe thunderstorms producing strong wind gusts will be
possible across the eastern U.S. from the mid-Atlantic region
northward into upstate New York. Additional isolated strong storms
may occur from southeast Missouri into northwest Texas.

...From central VA/NC northward into northern NY...
An upper trough will eject northeastward across Quebec, with modest
midlevel winds glancing parts of the Northeast. Veering low-level
winds will result in a slowing front, and as such a moist and
unstable air mass will remain across the lower Great Lakes. Farther
south, into central VA/NC, a surface trough will deepen as heating
occurs, with weak flow aloft.

While low-end in nature, sporadic damaging gusts cannot be ruled out
on the local level, from VA/NC northward into NY within the warm
sector. Thunderstorm probabilities are high, though little
organization is expected.

...Lower OH Valley across the Ozarks and into northern Texas...
Early day rain and thunderstorms may be ongoing across parts of MO,
OK and AR in association with a weak upper trough. Models indicate
outflows may stabilize the air mass over parts of the area, but
pockets of stronger instability should redevelop. The strongest
heating will likely extend from western TX into northwest TX and
this should aid sporadic strong cells capable of locally strong
gusts.

1123 AM CDT Sat Jul 12 2025

Valid 121630Z - 131200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS LOWER
MICHIGAN AND THE LOWER/MIDDLE OHIO VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe storms capable of damaging winds are expected
across eastern Lower Michigan to the Lower/Middle Ohio Valley,
mainly from mid-afternoon through sunset.

...Lower MI into Lower/Mid OH Valley...
Recent surface analysis shows a pre-frontal wind shift from central
Lower MI southwestward through central IN. The cold front itself is
a bit farther west, extending across western Lower MI through far
northwest IN and southern IL, although the temperature gradient is a
bit diffuse. Additionally, satellite imagery shows a series of
gravity waves ahead of the pre-frontal wind shift. These waves have
aided in the development of thunderstorms over northern Lower MI and
farther south in south-central MI. This complex pattern coupled with
cloudiness results in uncertainty regarding the overall convective
evolution across the region today. 

The highest severe thunderstorm potential still appears to be across
north-central/northeast Lower MI, where recent mesoanalysis places a
belt of stronger low-level flow. This is verified by the APX VAD,
which has recently sampled 30 to 40 kt between 1 and 2 km. Upper 60s
to low 70s dewpoints are in place over the region, and mesoanalysis
already estimates minimal convective inhibition with MLCAPE from
1000 to 1500 J/kg. Some filtered heating is ongoing as well, with
instability expected to increase through the early afternoon ahead
of the approaching front. As mentioned in recently issued MCD #1654,
there may be a window of opportunity early afternoon this for
supercell development along/ahead of the front, especially across
northeast lower MI. Any such development would pose a threat of
damaging wind, isolated hail, and possibly a tornado. Otherwise,
multicell clusters and perhaps a transient supercell or two will
become increasingly possible into this afternoon, with a primary
threat of damaging wind.

Farther south, lift along the front combined with mesoscale ascent
attendant to the convective cluster currently over far southeast MO 
should result in afternoon thunderstorm development from southern
IL/far western KY into much of IN. Strong buoyancy is expected ahead
of the front, but shear will be weaker, with a less organized storm
mode anticipated. Even so, given the number of storms anticipated, a
few convective clusters capable of damaging gusts are possible. This
risk should shift eastward into OH and KY before storm weaken this
evening.

...Southern Plains into the Ozarks...
A triplet of MCVs is apparent in recent satellite imagery, with one
MCV over southwest KS, another over the far eastern TX Panhandle,
and the last over the TX South Plains. Thunderstorm development is
possible with each of these features, particularly the one moving
eastward out of the eastern TX Panhandle into western/central OK.
Storms will likely diurnally increase and intensify this afternoon
across much of OK and a large part of north TX. Shear will be weak
across much of the region, except near the MCV where some
low/mid-level flow enhancement is possible. This could result in a
few more organized updrafts across north-central/central OK. Even
so, deep-layer flow will remain modest, which is expected to limit
the overall severe coverage.

...Colorado/New Mexico...
Thunderstorm development is again anticipated over the higher
terrain of central CO and north-central NM this afternoon. Modestly
enhanced mid/upper-level north-northwesterlies should aid in
weak/transient updraft rotation, supporting the potential for
isolated severe hail. The airmass across the CO Plains is not
expected to be as favorable for storm persistence as the last few
days, suggesting the threat for strong gusts is lower. The airmass
is a bit more favorable across NM, suggesting a relatively greater
chance of a few severe across the NM High Plains.

...WI into Upper MI...
Isolated severe hail/damaging winds may also develop along the
secondary cold front advancing eastward across northern/eastern
WI and Upper MI. Cooling mid-level temperatures will aid in weak
MLCAPE of 500-1000 J/kg this afternoon. Westerly low-level wind
profiles will modulate the degree of deep-layer shear, helping to
marginalize the overall threat.

...Mid-South/Tennessee Valley to the Carolinas/Virginia...
A pulse storm environment characterized by weak effective bulk shear
but moderate buoyancy will support a threat for isolated wet
microbursts from mid-afternoon to early evening, with tree damage
possible.

Mesoscale Discussion 1647
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0354 PM CDT Fri Jul 11 2025

Areas affected...southeast Colorado into eastern New Mexico and the
western Oklahoma/Texas Panhandles.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 112054Z - 112230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered storms developing off the Raton Mesa and along
the stalled front will likely pose a risk for damaging gusts and
isolated hail into this evening.

DISCUSSION...As of 2050 UTC, regional radar and satellite imagery
showed initial thunderstorms intensifying across the higher terrain
of southern CO and eastern NM. Driven largely by weak upslope flow
and diurnal heating, gradual storm intensification is expected over
the next couple of hours. Warm surface temperatures and adequate
moisture are supporting moderate buoyancy amid mid-level lapse rates
of 7-8 C/km. This should support stronger updrafts as convection
develops off the higher terrain through the remainder of the
afternoon. Vertical shear is not overly strong (30-40 kt), but
sufficient for a few organized storms including supercells or
persistent multi-cell clusters. With time, scattered to widespread
thunderstorms will develop and spread eastward into the TX/K
Panhandles. Given the degree of buoyancy and potential for
supercells, an initial risk for hail is expected. A deeply mixed
boundary layer and consolidating outflow should also favor a
damaging wind risk, especially with some upscale growth later this
evening.

Lingering inhibition and the limited forcing for ascent suggests the
overall convective evolution may be somewhat slow. CAM guidance
agrees, showing storm organization occurring as storm coverage
increases this evening. However, the environment is expected to
support an increasing severe risk into this evening. Some
uncertainty exists regarding the timing, but a severe thunderstorm
watch appears probable this afternoon/evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 1646
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0353 PM CDT Fri Jul 11 2025

Areas affected...Southern/eastern IA into southwest WI...northwest
IL...far northern MO

Concerning...Tornado Watch 505...

Valid 112053Z - 112230Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 505 continues.

SUMMARY...Damaging wind and localized tornado potential will
continue through late afternoon. Eventual downstream watch issuance
is possible.

DISCUSSION...As of 2045 UTC, a small bowing segment appears to be
developing across east-central IA, with the KDVN/KDMX radars
depicting a compact but intensifying velocity signature across
Benton and Linn Counties. This bowing segment will continue to move
eastward along a baroclinic zone and could produce a swath of
damaging winds, along with some potential for a line-embedded
tornado and isolated hail.

Elsewhere, multiple discrete cells are ongoing from southwest WI
into parts of southern IA. While deep-layer shear is only marginally
favorable for supercells, a favorable overlap of low-level
instability and modestly enhanced surface vorticity could support a
tornado threat with these cells, especially in the vicinity of the
primary baroclinic zone. The stronger cells will also be capable of
producing isolated hail. 

Some severe threat may eventually spread into a larger portion of
central/northern IL and southern WI, and downstream watch issuance
is possible depending on short-term trends with ongoing convection.

Mesoscale Discussion 1645
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0336 PM CDT Fri Jul 11 2025

Areas affected...parts of southeast Wyoming...western Nebraska and
northern Colorado

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 112036Z - 112230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Developing storms will likely pose a risk for hail and
damaging gusts into this evening. A WW is possible.

DISCUSSION...Initial high-based storms developing/occurring across
the higher-terrain of southeastern WY and northern CO are showing
signs of intensification. Located within a post-frontal upslope flow
regime, inhibition has been slow to diminish this afternoon.
However, strong heating and weak ascent form several perturbations
in the westerly flow aloft will continue to support gradual storm
development/maturation. MLCAPE of 500-1000 J/kg will support strong
updrafts as storms move off the higher terrain and develop along the
front across western NE. 30-40 kt of deep-layer shear should allow
for some organization into supercells and longer-lived clusters.
With moderately steep lapse rates in place, hail is expected, along
with isolated severe gusts. 

Initial storm organization may be slowed somewhat by lingering
inhibition and relatively weak forcing. Storms remaining close to
the terrain should gradually intensify before moving into the lower
elevations later this afternoon/early this evening. As convection
continues to increase in coverage and intensity, a severe watch may
be needed.

Mesoscale Discussion 1644
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0316 PM CDT Fri Jul 11 2025

Areas affected...portions of southeastern Kansas...northern Oklahoma
and the far eastern Texas Panhandle.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 112016Z - 112215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered storm development later this afternoon may pose
a risk for sporadic damaging gusts and some hail. A WW is unlikely.

DISCUSSION...Boundary-layer destabilization is underway across much
of the southern and central Plains ahead of a slow-moving cold
front. Afternoon satellite imagery showed strong surface heating was
resulting in gradual deepening of cumulus along and ahead of the
front from eastern KS to northern OK. As continued heating and weak
ascent from a passing upper-level trough overspread the area, a
gradual increase in thunderstorms is expected this afternoon and
evening. Focused largely along the front, modest vertical shear will
favor a complex mode of multi cell clusters. 1500-2000 J/kg of
MLCAPE observed from the 18z LMN/AMA soundings will support
transient stronger updrafts capable of some hail with these storms.
A deep and well-mixed boundary layer with prominent inverted-V
structure should also support occasional stronger downdrafts capable
of damaging gusts.

Observational trends and recent CAM data suggest storm development
will occur first along the front across eastern KS before spreading
southwest into northern OK and the TX Panhandle. As storm clusters
and outflow begin to amalgamate, the risk for damaging gusts will
slowly increase into early evening. Given the limited storm
organization a WW is not expected.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 507
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
220 PM CDT Fri Jul 11 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Far West-Central Illinois
  Extreme Northeast Kansas
  Northern Missouri

* Effective this Friday afternoon and evening from 220 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Scattered large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm coverage and intensity is forecast to
increase from northeast KS across northern MO and into west-central
IL this afternoon. Strong to extreme buoyancy is in place across the
region, supporting the potential for robust updrafts. Vertical shear
is weak, which could limit storm organization, but the intense
updrafts and related water loading could result in numerous strong
downbursts. A few instances of hail could occur as well, but warm
temperatures should preclude a greater hail threat.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 45
statute miles north and south of a line from Leavenworth KS to 35
miles east southeast of Quincy IL. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU7).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 505
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1255 PM CDT Fri Jul 11 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  South-Central and Southeast Iowa
  Far Northwest Illinois
  Far Northern Missouri

* Effective this Friday afternoon and evening from 1255 PM until
  800 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes likely
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Scattered large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development is anticipated this afternoon in
close proximity to a surface low over far southwest IA, and
associated warm front that extends eastward across southern IA into
far northwest IL. Ample low-level moisture is supporting strong
buoyancy, and the potential for robust updrafts. Supercells capable
of all severe hazards, including tornadoes, are possible within this
environment.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 40 statute miles
north and south of a line from 45 miles west northwest of Lamoni IA
to 30 miles northeast of Moline IL. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU5).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 24035.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0233 PM CDT Fri Jul 11 2025

Valid 131200Z - 191200Z

Upper ridging should dominate the western into south-central CONUS
through at least early next week, before the ridge flattens through
the remainder of next week. Multiple mid-level impulses will crest
the ridge through early next week, providing enough upper support to
induce dry and windy conditions along the Cascades on Day 3 (Sunday)
and Days 4-5 (Monday-Tuesday), where 40 percent critical
probabilities have been maintained. Monsoonal moisture will continue
to linger around the Four Corners region into next week, providing a
mix of wet and dry thunderstorms nearly every day into next week.
Given that storms may be on the wetter side, and may occur over the
same regions (hence the dampening of fuels), no dry thunderstorm
probabilities were added to this region. Isolated dry thunderstorms
may become an increasing concern across portions of the Pacific
Northwest into the northern Great Basin/Central Rockies region
through parts of next week as mid-level troughs traverse the
Interior West. However, given the overall weak forcing with these
low-amplitude troughs, and differences in timing of the troughs in
medium-range guidance, confidence is too low to specify the location
and timing of dry thunderstorms at this time.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0340 AM CDT Fri Jul 11 2025

Valid 141200Z - 191200Z

...DISCUSSION...
A surface cold front across the southern Great Plains early in the
period will quickly redevelop northward into the northern Plains in
response to strong lee cyclogenesis across the northern High Plains.
This cyclogenesis will occur in response to a positive-tilt
short-wave trough moving through the broadly zonal mid-level flow
across the northern US. 

This front will move back south during the period as a seasonably
strong high pressure builds southward into the central US in the
wake of the aforementioned short-wave trough. Thunderstorms are
likely to develop in the vicinity of the front/aggregate outflow
boundary each afternoon as it moves south. However, given the lack
of significant flow amplification as the mid-level wave crosses the
northern US, it is likely that thunderstorms will remain displaced
south of the requisite effective-layer shear needed to promote an
organized severe threat identifiable at this time range.

One exception to the idea that storms will be displaced from the
better shear may take place on Monday/Day-4 across portions of North
Dakota. Here, low-level moisture will surge northward in response to
the aforementioned northern High Plains lee cyclogenesis. Steep
mid-level lapse rates will overspread the northern Great Plains
during the day, yielding most-unstable CAPE values ranging from 1000
J/kg to perhaps 3000 J/kg depending on model guidance.  

However, run-to-run inconsistency in the space and time evolution of
relevant features leads to little confidence in identifying where
any overlap of thunderstorms, instability, and effective-layer shear
might support severe thunderstorms. However, if model guidance
begins to converge on potential scenarios, probabilistic delineation
may become warranted in subsequent forecasts.

Mesoscale Discussion 1633
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0243 PM CDT Thu Jul 10 2025

Areas affected...Eastern Colorado to northeast New Mexico and
northwest Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 101943Z - 102145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms moving off the Rockies will be capable of
severe downburst winds from eastern Colorado into northeast New
Mexico and northwest Kansas. Thunderstorm coverage is expected to be
relatively higher across CO, and may require watch issuance in the
short-term.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm coverage has slowly increased over the
past 1-2 hours across central CO. Observed dewpoint depressions on
the order of 40-50 F hint that very deep/dry boundary layers are in
place east of the Front Range across the High Plains. While buoyancy
is fairly limited (MLCAPE around 250-500 J/kg), LCLs between 3-4 km
will favor very strong downdraft accelerations via evaporative
cooling. Severe downburst winds have already been observed with more
isolated convection earlier today, and velocity imagery from KFTG is
showing 40-50 knot low-level outflow winds associated with stronger
convective cores. The potential for severe winds should increase in
tandem with convective coverage through the late afternoon hours
when diurnal heating/mixing will be maximized. Expanding cold pools
coupled with 25-35 knot 0-6 km bulk shear may support the
development of one or more organized clusters that could pose a more
robust wind threat with gusts potentially as high as 80 mph. In
general, thunderstorm coverage should remain greatest across CO due
to ascent associated with a passing mid-level wave and weak cold
front, though more isolated severe storms are possible further south
into northeast NM. Watch issuance is probable for portions of the
region as thunderstorm coverage (and the severe wind threat)
increases.

Mesoscale Discussion 1632
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0241 PM CDT Thu Jul 10 2025

Areas affected...much of western Kansas into south-central Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 101941Z - 102145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Storms will develop across much of western Kansas and into
south-central Nebraska, with damaging wind gusts likely. Isolated
large hail may also occur.

DISCUSSION...Satellite imagery shows towering CU developing with a
surface trough/wind shift from the western OK across KS and into
south-central NE. Temperatures within this zone are near 100 F,
while dewpoints have only only mixed down into the mid to upper 50s
F. 

Given the hot and deeply mixed boundary layer, strong wind gusts
appear probable. Veering winds with height also suggest some
cellular mode is possible as well, and isolated hail may occur with
the strongest storms. However, northeastward propagating mixed-mode
severe appears most likely.

across the Missouri River this evening. A tornado and hail risk may
exist initially, following by a corridor of significant damaging
wind potential.

DISCUSSION...Satellite and radar indicate an arcing line of elevated
thunderstorms over northeast NE, spreading into southeast SD and
western IA. This activity is supported by theta-e advection with
southwest flow off the surface, with steep lapse rates aloft.

Behind this activity, temporary subsidence and clearing exist over
eastern NE. While initially cool, this air mass should destabilize
again this evening.

Meanwhile, a large CU field is currently developing over central and
north-central NE, near a stationary front. Deep moisture convergence
will persist in this area, with the cap being breached later this
afternoon. Aiding cap removal are hot temperatures just downstream
into northern KS/southern NE, where temperatures are over 100 F.

Veering winds with height, combined with strong instability, will
favor slow-moving supercells at first, with tornado and large hail
risk. With time, a severe MCS is forecast, with increasing damaging
wind potential. Significant wind gusts over 75 mph appear likely.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0343 PM CDT Wed Jul 09 2025

Areas affected...Portions of
Maryland...Delaware...Pennsylvania...and New Jersey

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 497...

Valid 092043Z - 092245Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 497
continues.

SUMMARY...Convective trends are being monitored for the need for
downstream watch issuance across parts of Maryland, Delaware,
Pennsylvania, and New Jersey as storms spread east through early
evening.

DISCUSSION...Regional radar mosaics continue to show a slow, but
steady, increase in convective coverage across southern PA and parts
of northern MD as lift associated with a mid-level impulse continues
to migrate east and overspreads a moderately buoyant air mass.
Regional VWPs continue to sample 30-40 knot mid-level flow
associated with the upper feature, but the nebulous forcing for
ascent and modest mid-level lapse rates appear to be modulating
convective intensity and longevity of more discrete cells across
PA/MD. While the convective parameter space is supportive of
organized/severe convection, it remains unclear how intense
convection will become over the next few hours. 

Further south into eastern MD and DE, confidence is higher in a
severe wind threat later this evening. A squall line is slowly
organizing across central VA and is expected to continue
intensifying over the next few hours (see recently issued MCD #1619
for additional details). Recent surface observations and MLCAPE
analyses show a plume of rich low-level moisture/buoyancy extending
into southern DE/southeast MD, which should maintain the convective
line as it spreads east into the evening hours. Slow storm motions
cast some uncertainty on exactly when a downstream watch will be
needed, but recent high-res guidance suggest a damaging wind threat
will begin to materialize between 23-01 UTC.

Mesoscale Discussion 1619
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0249 PM CDT Wed Jul 09 2025

Areas affected...Far northern North Carolina into Virginia and
southern Maryland

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 497...

Valid 091949Z - 092145Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 497
continues.

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm intensification is ongoing across northern
North Carolina into Virginia. An increase in damaging/severe wind
potential is expected over the next couple of hours.

DISCUSSION...A leading convective band emanating off the Blue Ridge
Mountains is becoming established from northern VA into far
northwest NC. Latest GOES IR imagery shows rapid cloud-top cooling
associated with several deeper embedded convective cores, signifying
robust intensification. Buoyancy immediately downstream continues to
increase with temperatures warming into the upper 80s/low 90s and
MLCAPE approaching 2500 J/kg as of the 20z RAP mesoanalysis. This
air mass should promote further intensification over the next
several hours and is favorable for strong water-loaded downbursts.
At this point, storm mode should primarily be linear given mean flow
oriented along the developing band. 25-30 knot bulk shear should
support a few embedded surging segments within the line that may
pose a few focused corridors of damaging/severe winds with gusts as
high as 55-65 mph. Latest guidance hints that this potential should
be maximized over the next few hours from the NC/VA border into
central VA.

Mesoscale Discussion 1618
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0248 PM CDT Wed Jul 09 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern Idaho into southern Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 091948Z - 092115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Severe gusts will become an increasing concern as at least
scattered thunderstorms develop and mature through the afternoon. A
Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance may be needed.

DISCUSSION...Deepening CU over eastern ID/southern MT are indicating
attempts at thunderstorm initiation atop a destabilizing boundary
layer with eroding convective inhibition. 19Z mesoanalysis shows
boundary-layer lapse rates already reaching 9 C/km in some spots,
with 500+ J/kg MLCAPE. RAP forecast soundings indicate a dry
boundary layer extending to 500 mb, which is being overspread by
stronger mid-upper level flow and 30 kts of effective bulk shear
(i.e. straight hodographs indicating speed shear). Organized,
high-based multicells should traverse portions of the the northern
Rockies, accompanied by mainly a severe gust threat. If confidence
increases in greater coverage of severe gusts, a Severe Thunderstorm
Watch may be needed.

convective lines could then move eastward into more of the central
Dakotas and north-central Nebraska, with strong to severe gusts as
the primary risk. Some gusts over 75 mph are possible.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 85
statute miles east and west of a line from 30 miles northwest of
Bismarck ND to 40 miles southwest of Mullen NE. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

Mesoscale Discussion 1608
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0257 PM CDT Tue Jul 08 2025

Areas affected...portions of northeast Wisconsin and the UP of
Michigan

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 081957Z - 082130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong to severe storms may pose a risk for
damaging gusts and some hail this afternoon. A WW is not
anticipated.

DISCUSSION...Across portions of the upper Great Lakes, isolated
thunderstorms have developed along a weak front/wind shift this
afternoon.  Aided by weak ascent from a broad shortwave trough,
additional storm development/maturation is possible over the next
few hours. Warming surface temperatures and 60s F dewpoints were
supporting ~1000 J/kg of MCLAPE. Sufficient for strong updrafts,
35-40 kt of flow aloft will also favor some organization with
supercell structures or clusters. Isolated damaging gusts and some
hail are possible with the strongest storms.

The environment should continue to support occasional strong to
severe storms over the next few hours as the wind shift continues
toward the western shores of Lake Michigan. HRRR guidance suggests
additional storms are possible farther south into northern WI with
time. However, the limited overlap of buoyancy and shear, plus the
limited duration before crossing offshore suggests the overall
severe potential is low. A WW is unlikely, though convective trends
will be monitored.

Mesoscale Discussion 1607
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0232 PM CDT Tue Jul 08 2025

Areas affected...Portions of the Mid-Atlantic

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 496...

Valid 081932Z - 082130Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 496
continues.

SUMMARY...A line of thunderstorms is showing signs of
intensification; the damaging wind potential is expected to increase
over the coming hours as the line of storms approaches the I-95
corridor.

DISCUSSION...Latest GOES IR imagery shows steady cloud-top cooling
of individual cells embedded within a developing convective band as
convection begins moving off of the higher terrain and into a very
buoyant air mass in place downstream across the Mid-Atlantic. Latest
RAP mesoanalysis estimates suggest that MLCAPE ahead of the
developing line has increased to around 2500 J/kg as surface
temperatures warm into the mid 90s. Additionally, regional VWPs are
sampling 20-30 knot mid-level winds, which is supporting slightly
stronger deep-layer bulk shear values than depicted by recent
RAP/mesoanalysis estimates, which should contribute to better
organization and longevity of the developing band. Consequently, the
intensification trend is expected to continue as storms spread east
over the next few hours. As this occurs, the potential for
damaging/severe winds should also increase as cold pool
consolidation/organization continues. Recent storm track estimates
suggest that this activity should reach the I-95 corridor roughly
during the 20-22 UTC time frame, which should be when diurnal
heating and MLCAPE magnitudes will be maximized.

Areas affected...south-central Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 072028Z - 072200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated storms capable of large hail/damaging winds
expected to to continue. Watch issuance is possible but remains
uncertain in the short term.

DISCUSSION...Visible satellite/radar shows a few isolated storms
that have developed during peak heating amid a very unstable
airmass, characterized by MLCAPE values nearing 3000 J/kg. Deep
layer shear has remained somewhat marginal thus far, perhaps
approaching 30-35 kt, but is forecast to increase with time. Thus,
storms should exhibit supercell characteristics, with large hail and
damaging winds the primary threats. Southeasterly low-level flow is
promoting at least some elongation of hodographs, but low-level
shear remains weak in general. Thus, the tornado threat appears low
but cannot be ruled out. These storms are expected to remain
isolated, and thus, watch issuance is not anticipated in the short
term. However, convective trends will be monitored should a watch be
needed for the region.

Mesoscale Discussion 1594
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0303 PM CDT Mon Jul 07 2025

Areas affected...Far northeast New York...northern Vermont and New
Hampshire...and into central Maine

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 072003Z - 072200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong thunderstorms may pose a severe wind/hail
risk through the afternoon and early evening hours. This threat is
expected to remain sufficiently isolated to preclude watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...Latest regional radar imagery shows a gradual
maturation of convection across far northeast NY and across central
ME along/ahead of a cold front. Temperatures warming into the low
80s with dewpoints in the upper 60s to low 70s is slowly eroding
inhibition with MLCAPE increasing to around 500-1000 J/kg region
wide. This warming trend should continue and will promote further
thunderstorm intensification over the next couple of hours. 30-40
knot mid-level winds in proximity to a weakening upper trough are
supporting sufficient hodograph elongation for organized convection.
While convective mode will likely transition to predominantly a
semi-organized convective band due to strong flow along the
initiating cold front, an initial supercell or two appears possible
and may pose a severe hail/wind risk through the afternoon -
especially across central ME where forcing for ascent is currently
more nebulous. With time, strong to severe winds should become the
predominant hazard as a band of storms begins to emerge. Despite
these concerns, the overall severe threat is expected to remain
sufficiently isolated to preclude watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1593
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0255 PM CDT Mon Jul 07 2025

Areas affected...eastern North Dakota and northwest Minnesota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 071955Z - 072200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Large hail, damaging winds, and perhaps a tornado are
possible this afternoon/evening. Watch issuance is possible.

DISCUSSION...Regional satellite/radar show convection developing
along a cold front positioned from northeast North Dakota extending
southwestward, and along a warm front extending into northeast
Minnesota. This activity is developing in a region where skies have
remained clear in proximity to passing cirrus clouds to the
immediate south. In addition, cool mid-level temperatures are
overspreading the region, in association with an upper-level trough.
These factors are contributing to destabilization that is yielding
MLCAPE values near 1500 J/kg. Ample effective shear of 40-45 kt is
also present, associated with the aforementioned trough.

Storms are expected to continue increasing in coverage and severity
throughout the afternoon and into the evening. Large hail and
damaging wind gusts will be the primary threats. A tornado will also
be possible with any storm that can favorably interact with
aforementioned warm front. Coverage of storms remains uncertain in
the short term, given the extent of the cirrus shield limiting
destabilization. However, at least some CAM solutions suggest
greater coverage may materialize. Thus, convective trends will be
monitored for possible watch issuance this afternoon/evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 1592
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0223 PM CDT Mon Jul 07 2025

Areas affected...northeast Colorado...far southeast
Wyoming...southwest Nebraska...and northwest Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 071923Z - 072130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered severe storms expected by mid/late afternoon,
posing a threat for severe wind/hail. Watch possible.

DISCUSSION...Visible satellite show a broad area of terrain
generated convection over the mountains of central/northern Colorado
into far southeast Wyoming. Additional convection is now forming
downstream of this activity, along the lee of the Rockies. Clear
skies have promoted strong insolation amid a relatively moist
low-level airmass for the central High Plains, with dew point
temperatures in the mid/upper 50s F. This is contributing to an
west-to-east instability gradient, with MLCAPE values approaching
1500 J/kg in far northeast Colorado. Surface observations also
indicate a weak upslope flow regime in this region in advance of a
stalling cold front across the panhandle of Nebraska.

The aforementioned convection should continue to develop and
propagate eastward off the high terrain with time. As this occurs,
storms will encounter greater instability as MLCAPE values are
forecast to approach 2000-2500 J/kg. Effective shear is forecast to
increase throughout the afternoon/evening, approaching 35-45 kt.
This will help to promote storm organization into
supercell/multicell modes, with damaging winds and severe hail
expected. With time, cold pools may promote upscale growth into an
MCS this evening, transitioning into more of a damaging wind threat.
Given this potential, the area is being monitored for possible watch
issuance this afternoon.

Areas affected...north-central North Carolina into far southern
Virginia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 062044Z - 062215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A brief tornado or strong wind gust will remain possible
with the convection near the remnant core of TD Chantal.

DISCUSSION...Afternoon imagery shows the remnants of TD Chantal
located across portions of north-central NC near 34.4 deg N 79.2 deg
W. Within the broader precip shield, a few deeper convective towers
have remained strong with occasional cyclonic rotation observed.
Enhanced low-level shear (0-1km SRH near 200 m2/s2) near the remnant
center will remain strong enough to support occasional low-level
mesocyclones with this convection. Despite weak buoyancy (MLCAPE
(~500 J/kg) the moist surface environment and some deeper storms may
remain capable of a brief tornado two and damaging gust into this
evening. Widespread severe weather is not anticipated, and the
interaction of the circulation with higher terrain to the west
should slowly limit the threat tonight.

Mesoscale Discussion 1581
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0326 PM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025

Areas affected...portions of northern Maine

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 062026Z - 062200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated to widely scattered thunderstorms, including a
few supercells, may pose a risk for damaging gusts and small hail
this afternoon/evening. A WW is unlikely.

DISCUSSION...As of 2020 UTC, regional radar and satellite imagery
showed convection was strengthening across portions of Maine. As
temperatures have warmed into the upper 70s to low 80s, around 1000
J/kg of MLCAPE has developed with dewpoints in the 60s. While not
overly strong, this buoyancy should continue to support occasional
stronger updrafts with convection across the region. Deep-layer
shear is supportive of storm organization with the KCBW VAD showing
an elongated hodograph and 30-45 kt of bulk shear. Weak mid-level
rotation has already been observed and the environment suggests a
few supercell/organized multi cell structures are possible. With
poor lapse rates and relatively limited buoyancy, damaging gusts
still appear to be the primary risk. However, some small hail and a
brief tornado are possible with the stronger rotating storms.

HRRR guidance and observations suggests additional storm
development/intensification is plausible this afternoon with more
storms developing/moving in from eastern Canada this evening. While
some severe risk is possible, confidence in severe coverage is low
owing to weak forcing and limited buoyancy. Convective trends are
being monitored, but a WW is currently unlikely.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0218 PM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025

Areas affected...Eastern New Mexico

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 061918Z - 062145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms emanating off the southern Rockies will pose
an isolated severe wind/hail threat through the late afternoon and
early evening hours. Watch issuance is not expected.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm development within the Sangre de Cristo
and Sacramento mountains is evident in recent GOES imagery. Weak
mid-level flow over the region will likely result in slow storm
propagation off the higher terrain, but as this occurs storms will
eventually move into an unseasonably moist air mass downstream
(dewpoint values in the 75th-90th percentile for early July). This
moisture is contributing to around 1000-1500 J/kg MLCAPE that should
promote thunderstorm maintenance, and possibly intensification,
through late evening. A combination of semi-discrete cells and
propagating clusters is expected with an attendant threat for
isolated large hail (most likely near/below 1.25 inch in diameter)
and sporadic severe wind gusts. The overall severe threat is
expected to remain relatively isolated given the modest kinematic
environment, which should preclude the need for watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1578
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0138 PM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025

Areas affected...Northeast Colorado to southeast Wyoming and western
Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 061838Z - 062115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms developing within the higher terrain of the
central Rockies will spread east and intensify through the
afternoon. As this occurs, the threat for severe winds, and possibly
large hail, will increase. Watch issuance is probable later this
afternoon as thunderstorms increase in coverage and intensity.

DISCUSSION...Latest GOES imagery and lightning data shows a gradual
uptick in convection within the higher terrain of central to
northern CO and far southern WY as daytime heating drives increasing
orographic ascent within a weakly capped air mass. This initial
activity is expected to spread east into the High Plains over the
coming hours given 30-40 knot westerly flow within the CAPE-bearing
layer. Storm intensification is expected as convection overspreads a
relatively moist low-level air mass (dewpoints remain in the mid to
upper 50s downstream) and as lingering inhibition is removed via
deepening boundary-layer heating/mixing. 

Across southeast WY and western NE, slightly stronger zonal flow
aloft coupled with weak easterly low-level winds should promote
adequate deep-layer shear for a couple of supercells with an
attendant large hail risk (possibly up to 2 inches in diameter). The
tornado threat may also be locally greatest across this region due
to augmented low-level shear/SRH on the immediate cool side of a
residual outflow boundary emanating out of central NE.

Further south across CO, observed dewpoint depressions and
short-term forecast soundings suggest LCL heights should approach
2.5 to 3 km as temperatures warm into the upper 80s, which will
promote strong downdraft evaporative cooling and accelerations as
well as rapid cold pool production. Strong to severe downburst winds
and sporadic large hail appear likely within initially discrete
cells moving off the terrain and/or developing within the DCVZ, but
upscale growth into organized clusters is anticipated later this
afternoon/evening with a more widespread severe wind risk (with
gusts possibly as high as 70-80 mph). Watch issuance is probable as
these threats begin to emerge in the coming hours.

need for a TC-related Tornado Watch. However, trends will be
monitored.

DISCUSSION...A marginal increase in tornado potential may occur this
morning as Tropical Storm Chantal continues to move inland. This
marginal increase would coincide with modest diurnal heating
increasing and several feeder bands streaming inland on the eastern
semicircle of Chantal. The onshore environment containing these
feeder bands has little instability at present and the low-level
storm-relative helicity is on the lower side of land-falling
tropical cyclones. That said, the low-level storm-relative helicity
still remains sufficient for low-level rotation with stronger
thunderstorm updrafts. Present thinking is that the limited
instability and modest low-level helicity should preclude any longer
duration/larger area tornado threat and thus a TC-related tornado
watch is not currently anticipated. However, trends will continue to
be evaluated for increasing buoyancy and/or low-level helicity.

Mesoscale Discussion 1574
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0714 AM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025

Areas affected...southwest South Dakota and north-central Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 061214Z - 061415Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Ongoing thunderstorms should persist for another couple of
hours before weakening. Isolated hail and a damaging wind gust or
two will remain possible in the near term. A watch is not currently
expected.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms continue this morning across southwest
South Dakota along the southwest portion of a remnant MCS that moved
across this region overnight. These thunderstorms appear to be
driven by isentropic ascent focused atop a residual cold pool left
over from the overnight convection. This shows up as strong warm-air
advection centered around 700 MB in regional mesoanalysis.
Mesoanalysis also indicates a rich CAPE reservoir to the southwest
of the ongoing storms, within the thunderstorm source/inflow region,
providing additional buoyancy. With time, diurnal heating should
begin to modify the existing cold pool and weaken the isentropic
ascent/WAA leading to a downward trend in thunderstorm intensity.
Before this weakening occurs, lapse rates do not appear particular
steep this morning per RAP-model forecast soundings, and an
isotherms layer extends upward from the surface to around 800 mb.
This should limit the severe potential to isolated hail and perhaps
a damaging wind gust or two -- realistically only in the most
intense cores.

A watch is not anticipated.
