Mesoscale Discussion 1608
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0257 PM CDT Tue Jul 08 2025

Areas affected...portions of northeast Wisconsin and the UP of
Michigan

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 081957Z - 082130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong to severe storms may pose a risk for
damaging gusts and some hail this afternoon. A WW is not
anticipated.

DISCUSSION...Across portions of the upper Great Lakes, isolated
thunderstorms have developed along a weak front/wind shift this
afternoon.  Aided by weak ascent from a broad shortwave trough,
additional storm development/maturation is possible over the next
few hours. Warming surface temperatures and 60s F dewpoints were
supporting ~1000 J/kg of MCLAPE. Sufficient for strong updrafts,
35-40 kt of flow aloft will also favor some organization with
supercell structures or clusters. Isolated damaging gusts and some
hail are possible with the strongest storms.

The environment should continue to support occasional strong to
severe storms over the next few hours as the wind shift continues
toward the western shores of Lake Michigan. HRRR guidance suggests
additional storms are possible farther south into northern WI with
time. However, the limited overlap of buoyancy and shear, plus the
limited duration before crossing offshore suggests the overall
severe potential is low. A WW is unlikely, though convective trends
will be monitored.

Mesoscale Discussion 1607
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0232 PM CDT Tue Jul 08 2025

Areas affected...Portions of the Mid-Atlantic

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 496...

Valid 081932Z - 082130Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 496
continues.

SUMMARY...A line of thunderstorms is showing signs of
intensification; the damaging wind potential is expected to increase
over the coming hours as the line of storms approaches the I-95
corridor.

DISCUSSION...Latest GOES IR imagery shows steady cloud-top cooling
of individual cells embedded within a developing convective band as
convection begins moving off of the higher terrain and into a very
buoyant air mass in place downstream across the Mid-Atlantic. Latest
RAP mesoanalysis estimates suggest that MLCAPE ahead of the
developing line has increased to around 2500 J/kg as surface
temperatures warm into the mid 90s. Additionally, regional VWPs are
sampling 20-30 knot mid-level winds, which is supporting slightly
stronger deep-layer bulk shear values than depicted by recent
RAP/mesoanalysis estimates, which should contribute to better
organization and longevity of the developing band. Consequently, the
intensification trend is expected to continue as storms spread east
over the next few hours. As this occurs, the potential for
damaging/severe winds should also increase as cold pool
consolidation/organization continues. Recent storm track estimates
suggest that this activity should reach the I-95 corridor roughly
during the 20-22 UTC time frame, which should be when diurnal
heating and MLCAPE magnitudes will be maximized.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0256 PM CDT Tue Jul 08 2025

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR CENTRAL NEVADA AND FAR WESTERN
UTAH...

...Great Basin...
A mid-level jet max rounding the southern periphery of a short wave
ejecting into the Great Basin will move over NV Wednesday. Efficient
boundary layer mixing and subsequent surface winds of 15-25 mph with
relative humidity in the 10-15% range will result in critical fire
weather conditions across central NV/ far western UT Wednesday
afternoon amid dry/receptive fuels. A broader elevated fire weather
threat remains across much of the Great Basin as the trough pushes
through the region. 

...Northwest...
Deep-layer westerly flow will continue to bring elevated fire
weather conditions to portions of the Columbia Basin on Wednesday. 
A cold front and general onshore flow pattern will usher in cooler
temperatures and higher relative humidity through the Cascade gaps
and Columbia River Gorge but overall stronger surface winds and a
remaining dry boundary layer will support an elevated fire weather 
threat across the eastern Columbia Basin.

Isolated high-based thunderstorms are still expected across
southeastern OR and southwestern ID as a mid-level trough axis
pushes into the Great Basin. Limited rainfall will increase ignition
efficiency over dry fuels in addition to providing gusty/erratic
outflow winds.

..Williams.. 07/08/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0153 AM CDT Tue Jul 08 2025/

...Synopsis...
A compact midlevel trough will track eastward across the Northwest
during the day -- in tandem with a robust midlevel trough/low moving
eastward from British Columbia into Alberta. Large-scale ascent
preceding the midlevel trough moving across the Northwest will
promote another day of isolated high-based thunderstorms -- with a
focus over southeastern OR into southwestern ID. Deep inverted-V
soundings and PW around 0.7 inches will favor dry thunderstorms
capable of producing lightning-induced ignitions and strong/erratic
outflow winds. 

Similar to Day 1/Tuesday, a belt of strong deep-layer westerly flow
(peripheral to the midlevel trough) across the Cascades will lead to
breezy/gusty westerly surface winds in the Columbia Basin. While
increasing boundary-layer moisture will limit RH reductions compared
to Day 1/Tuesday, stronger surface winds will offset this and still
yield elevated fire-weather conditions. 

Over the Great Basin, moderate midlevel southwesterly winds
accompanying the compact midlevel trough will overspread the Great
Basin during the day. Deep boundary-layer mixing into this
strengthening flow aloft will support another day of elevated to
locally critical fire-weather conditions, given increasingly
dry/receptive fuels.

Valid 082000Z - 091200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PARTS OF THE
MID-ATLANTIC...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are expected across the Mid-Atlantic
states. More isolated severe storms are expected across portions of
the Plains into the Mid Mississippi Valley.

...20Z Update...
Minor changes were made to the outlook based on current
observations. Otherwise, the previous forecast reasoning remains
valid.

..Wendt.. 07/08/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1125 AM CDT Tue Jul 08 2025/

...Mid-Atlantic this afternoon/evening...
Strong surface heating is underway within a very moist boundary
layer consisting of generally mid 70s dewpoints.  Regional 12z
soundings, modified for afternoon temperatures and associated
vertical mixing, suggest the potential for MLCAPE near or above 2000
J/kg with minimal convective inhibition.  Larger-scale forcing for
ascent will be modest with a slightly enhanced (~25 kt) belt of
west-southwesterly midlevel flow from the OH Valley to southern New
England, though the primary focus for scattered thunderstorm
development is expected to be a surface trough from the immediate
lee of the Blue Ridge into MA by mid afternoon.  Though midlevel
lapse rates will not be particularly steep, steepening low-level
lapse rates with hot afternoon temperatures in the low-mid 90s will
drive strong downdraft potential (per DCAPE near 1000 J/kg) and the
resultant threat for wind damage with multicell clusters and/or
short line segments.

...Central High Plains to the Ozarks this afternoon/evening...
A weakening outflow boundary from overnight convection is moving
southeastward into southeast MO, and southward into OK, while a
remnant MCV moves eastward over northern MO.  South of the outflow,
clouds and ongoing convection from eastern OK to the MO Bootheel
cast uncertainty on the degree of destabilization this afternoon in
advance of this portion of the outflow.  Farther west, stronger
surface heating/destabilization is expected along and south of the
outflow into OK, but forcing for ascent is in question with gradual
height rises expected aloft.  A weak lee trough could help focus at
least isolated thunderstorm development this afternoon/evening
across the central High Plains, where northwesterly flow
aloft/hodograph length could be sufficient for a high-based
supercell or two.  However, a specific focus for initiation and the
potential for upscale growth are both uncertain given the background
height rises and little forcing for ascent.  Thus, will maintain the
broad MRGL area for a low probability/conditional threat for severe
outflow winds and some hail.

...Northeast WI/Upper MI this afternoon/evening...
A midlevel shortwave trough and weak surface reflection will cross
northern WI and western Upper MI this afternoon, and a few storms
will be possible by mid afternoon from central Upper MI into extreme
northeast WI (in the wake of weak morning convection). 
Thermodynamic recovery from weak morning convection and some
enhancement to westerly deep-layer shear suggests the potential for
semi-organized storms/clusters and a low-end threat for wind damage
and hail for a few hours later this afternoon/evening.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0229 PM CDT Tue Jul 08 2025

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN PARTS OF THE
CENTRAL/NORTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible over parts of the
central and northern Great Plains, mainly during the late afternoon
and evening on Thursday.

...KS/NE/SD/IA...
A shortwave impulse over the northeast Great Basin at 12Z Thursday
should slowly dampen as it tracks into the central Plains. A
separate, positive-tilt shortwave trough will amplify across
southwest Canada along the international border with the Northwest.
This should yield an effective split flow regime over the
northern/central Plains on Thursday/Thursday night. 

Preceding low-level warm-advection driven convection on Thursday
morning should modulate the degree of downstream destabilization
from the Mid-MO Valley into the Upper Midwest. Primary severe
potential should evolve from scattered thunderstorms forming at peak
diurnal heating across the central High Plains to Black Hills
vicinity. With an initially pronounced EML, large buoyancy should be
pervasive downstream in KS to SD. Mid-level wind fields with the
decaying impulse appear erratic across guidance, indicative of
attendant MCV influences from prior-day convection. But it should be
sufficient for multicell clustering and supercells capable of mixed
severe wind/hail threats. A strengthening low-level jet on Thursday
evening, from the southern High Plains nosing towards the Mid-MO
Valley, should sustain an MCS eastward near its exit region. The
spatiotemporal extent of a severe wind threat overnight is rather
uncertain.

...ND and northwest MN...
Strengthening of deep-layer shear attendant to the southwest
Canadian shortwave trough is largely anticipated to occur during the
latter half of the period. This may still be enough to support
organized convection by early evening along a cold front trailing
into the eastern ND vicinity. Ample buoyancy and steep mid-level
lapse rates will be supportive of a couple supercells early that may
congeal into a south/southeast-moving cluster Thursday night.
Scattered large hail and damaging winds are possible.

...East...
A mid-level low will continue east across QC, with a belt of
moderate westerlies present across NY and New England. Weak (500-mb
winds below 20 kts) will be prevalent south of this belt in the
Mid-Atlantic States and Southeast. Widespread diurnal storm coverage
is again anticipated from the DE Valley southward, as the boundary
layer warms amid a broad plume of 70s surface dew points. Wet
microbursts producing localized damaging winds are the expected
hazard in this regime.

Convective coverage should be more scattered with northern extent. 
But this activity may organize into transient semi-discrete cells
and multicell clusters with a risk for at least isolated damaging
winds and small to marginally severe hail. This region will be
monitored in later outlooks for a potential level 2-SLGT risk.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1217 PM CDT Tue Jul 08 2025

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN PARTS OF THE
EAST AND THE NORTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered damaging winds are possible on Wednesday afternoon to
early evening from the Carolina Piedmont towards the Delaware
Valley. Isolated significant severe hail and sporadic severe gusts
are also possible across parts of the Dakotas from late afternoon to
mid-evening.

...Southeast to Mid-Atlantic States...
A lower-amplitude mid-level trough should drift east across the
central to Lower Great Lakes and OH Valley, north of a mid-level
anticyclone over the northeast Gulf. A belt of moderate mid-level
southwesterlies will be centered on the Mid-Atlantic, diminishing
with southward extent in the Southeast. Scattered to widespread
thunderstorms are expected to develop during the afternoon over the
southern Appalachians and Blue Ridge Mountains, spreading across the
adjacent Piedmont. Rather rich boundary-layer moisture downstream
will compensate for weak mid-level lapse rates to support an
extensive plume of MLCAPE from 2000-3000 J/kg. A few semi-organized
clusters may develop from VA towards DE Bay owing to the more
favorable shear. However, water-loaded downbursts producing damaging
winds appear to be the overarching scenario, which is signaled by
the 12Z HREF max wind speed field. 

...Northern Great Plains...
Just downstream of a low-amplitude mid-level ridge emanating north
from an anticyclone over the Southwest, guidance suggests that
isolated to scattered late-afternoon thunderstorms should form along
a weak surface trough. Low-level moisture ahead of this trough will
gradually build beneath a stout EML. A corridor of large to extreme
buoyancy is probable from a portion of western/central ND into NE by
peak heating. Despite modest mid-level west-northwesterlies owing to
the ridge proximity, stronger upper-level westerlies will support
adequate deep-layer shear for a few supercells. Significant severe
hail will be possible in any sustained supercells. Outflow-dominated
downdrafts should foster clustering east-southeastward with a risk
for sporadic severe gusts before waning Wednesday night.

...Interior Northwest...
Downstream of a shortwave trough moving east across northern CA into
the northwest Great Basin, an elongated belt of moderate mid-level
southwesterlies will exist into MT. Within this favorable flow
regime, scattered afternoon to early evening thunderstorms will aid
in strong to isolated severe gusts from eastern OR to
southern/central/eastern MT. 

...Lower MI...
Isolated, marginally severe hail and locally damaging winds are
possible as scattered thunderstorms develop during the afternoon,
supported by a modest combination of deep-layer shear/buoyancy.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1151 AM CDT Tue Jul 08 2025

Valid 081700Z - 091200Z

...Northwest...
A mid-level low will gradually push into northern CA through tonight
supporting isolated to scattered thunderstorms along an axis of
instability from the northern Klamath Mountains into the higher
terrain of central/northeast OR. Precipitable water values in the
0.5 to 0.75 inch range atop a dry boundary layer will limit rainfall
with thunderstorms increasing potential of new lightning ignitions
atop dry fuels.

...Great Basin...
Elevated highlights were expanded into northeastern NV. Current
surface observations show a wide swath 8-15% relative humidity
values from central to northeastern NV. Enhanced mid-level flow atop
a very dry/well-mixed boundary layer by this afternoon will support
elevated fire weather conditions across much of central and
northeastern NV, with more widespread single digit RH values by this
afternoon, particularly across central NV.

..Williams.. 07/08/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0152 AM CDT Tue Jul 08 2025/

...Synopsis...
Along the northwestern periphery of an expansive midlevel ridge over
the Southwest, a midlevel low will approach the northern CA coast as
it gradually phases with a robust midlevel trough moving across
British Columbia. Large-scale ascent preceding the midlevel low will
promote isolated dry/high-based thunderstorms over the higher
terrain of OR into far southeastern WA. Given dry/receptive fuels
and limited rainfall with these storms, lightning-induced ignitions
will be possible, along with strong convective outflow. 

Additionally, strong deep-layer westerly flow in the base of the
midlevel trough moving across British Columbia will overspread the
Cascades, resulting in dry/breezy downslope flow and elevated
fire-weather conditions in the Columbia Basin.

Farther south, a belt of enhanced midlevel southwesterly flow will
overspread the Great Basin between the large-scale ridge and
midlevel low. Deep boundary-layer mixing into this enhanced flow
aloft will favor dry/breezy conditions over central NV into western
UT, and given dry fuels, elevated fire-weather conditions are
expected.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1125 AM CDT Tue Jul 08 2025

Valid 081630Z - 091200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS
AFTERNOON/EVENING FOR PARTS OF THE MID-ATLANTIC...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are expected across the Mid-Atlantic
states. More isolated severe storms are expected across portions of
the Plains into the Mid Mississippi Valley.

...Mid-Atlantic this afternoon/evening...
Strong surface heating is underway within a very moist boundary
layer consisting of generally mid 70s dewpoints.  Regional 12z
soundings, modified for afternoon temperatures and associated
vertical mixing, suggest the potential for MLCAPE near or above 2000
J/kg with minimal convective inhibition.  Larger-scale forcing for
ascent will be modest with a slightly enhanced (~25 kt) belt of
west-southwesterly midlevel flow from the OH Valley to southern New
England, though the primary focus for scattered thunderstorm
development is expected to be a surface trough from the immediate
lee of the Blue Ridge into MA by mid afternoon.  Though midlevel
lapse rates will not be particularly steep, steepening low-level
lapse rates with hot afternoon temperatures in the low-mid 90s will
drive strong downdraft potential (per DCAPE near 1000 J/kg) and the
resultant threat for wind damage with multicell clusters and/or
short line segments.

...Central High Plains to the Ozarks this afternoon/evening...
A weakening outflow boundary from overnight convection is moving
southeastward into southeast MO, and southward into OK, while a
remnant MCV moves eastward over northern MO.  South of the outflow,
clouds and ongoing convection from eastern OK to the MO Bootheel
cast uncertainty on the degree of destabilization this afternoon in
advance of this portion of the outflow.  Farther west, stronger
surface heating/destabilization is expected along and south of the
outflow into OK, but forcing for ascent is in question with gradual
height rises expected aloft.  A weak lee trough could help focus at
least isolated thunderstorm development this afternoon/evening
across the central High Plains, where northwesterly flow
aloft/hodograph length could be sufficient for a high-based
supercell or two.  However, a specific focus for initiation and the
potential for upscale growth are both uncertain given the background
height rises and little forcing for ascent.  Thus, will maintain the
broad MRGL area for a low probability/conditional threat for severe
outflow winds and some hail.

...Northeast WI/Upper MI this afternoon/evening...
A midlevel shortwave trough and weak surface reflection will cross
northern WI and western Upper MI this afternoon, and a few storms
will be possible by mid afternoon from central Upper MI into extreme
northeast WI (in the wake of weak morning convection). 
Thermodynamic recovery from weak morning convection and some
enhancement to westerly deep-layer shear suggests the potential for
semi-organized storms/clusters and a low-end threat for wind damage
and hail for a few hours later this afternoon/evening.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
MID-ATLANTIC STATES...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are expected across the Mid-Atlantic
states. More isolated severe storms are expected across portions of
the Plains into the Mid Mississippi Valley.

...Mid-Atlantic States...
A relatively active thunderstorm day is expected this afternoon into
evening regionally. In association with semi-amplified westerlies
centered over the Midwest/Great Lakes, a weak mid-level disturbance
or two will likely influence the region later today. This will be in
conjunction with a moist airmass, with moderately strong buoyancy
developing by late morning given ample insolation east of the
Appalachians. A modest enhancement to the westerlies aloft may
contribute to as much as 25 kt effective shear, supportive of
sustained clusters and linear segments. Steep low-level lapse rates
and high-water content suggests damaging downbursts are likely,
especially with any organized clusters this afternoon through around
mid-evening. This most favored corridor for downbursts/tree damage
is expected to focus east of the Blue Ridge across eastern portions
of Virginia/Maryland into southeast Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

...Plains to Middle Mississippi Valley...
Severe storms will again be possible today on the eastern periphery
of the Southwest/Four Corners-centered upper ridge. Several
low-amplitude disturbances will pivot the ridge coincident with
modestly enhanced north-northwesterly flow aloft across the High
Plains, while a decayed MCS and residual MCV/outflow will influence
renewed diurnal deep convective development across the Ozarks and
middle Mississippi Valley later today. Sporadic bouts of damaging
winds can be expected, with large hail potential more focused across
the High Plains, and in particular the north-central High Plains
where a Slight Risk could be warranted pending
guidance/observational trends later this morning.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0317 AM CDT Tue Jul 08 2025

Valid 111200Z - 161200Z

...DISCUSSION...
The overall current large-scale pattern will persist through this
forecast period, albeit with minor day-to-day variations. More
specifically, a mid-level ridge will persist across the western US,
although its center will meander from the Southwest US to off the
coast of California and back; a series of shortwave troughs of
varying intensity will quickly move across the northern Plains; and
a very warm, moist environment will remain entrenched across the
eastern US. 

This overall pattern suggests episodic bouts of severe thunderstorms
on any given day. However, the timing and location of specific
episodes will be tied to mesoscale details and impacts from prior
days' convection which have low predictability on time scales of
this forecast period. As such, low confidence in the details of
required to identify any of these severe events currently precludes
any probabilistic delineation at this time.

That said, there are a couple of scenarios being monitored for
potential future highlights. The first is the potential for severe
storms across the southern Plains on Saturday or Sunday associated
with a residual boundary/front. However, impacts from a potential
overnight mesoscale convective system moving from the High Plains
into the Southern Plains on Friday night into Saturday lead to
little confidence in the placement of any boundaries and the
resulting severe potential. 

Another potential is for severe convection across northern Minnesota
and the Upper Great Lakes early next week associated with a stronger
shortwave trough moving through southern Canada. However, guidance
continues to show high variance regarding the strength of moisture
return, degree of instability, and timing of the shortwave itself to
preclude unconditional severe probabilities at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 1595
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0328 PM CDT Mon Jul 07 2025

Areas affected...south-central Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 072028Z - 072200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated storms capable of large hail/damaging winds
expected to to continue. Watch issuance is possible but remains
uncertain in the short term.

DISCUSSION...Visible satellite/radar shows a few isolated storms
that have developed during peak heating amid a very unstable
airmass, characterized by MLCAPE values nearing 3000 J/kg. Deep
layer shear has remained somewhat marginal thus far, perhaps
approaching 30-35 kt, but is forecast to increase with time. Thus,
storms should exhibit supercell characteristics, with large hail and
damaging winds the primary threats. Southeasterly low-level flow is
promoting at least some elongation of hodographs, but low-level
shear remains weak in general. Thus, the tornado threat appears low
but cannot be ruled out. These storms are expected to remain
isolated, and thus, watch issuance is not anticipated in the short
term. However, convective trends will be monitored should a watch be
needed for the region.

Mesoscale Discussion 1594
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0303 PM CDT Mon Jul 07 2025

Areas affected...Far northeast New York...northern Vermont and New
Hampshire...and into central Maine

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 072003Z - 072200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong thunderstorms may pose a severe wind/hail
risk through the afternoon and early evening hours. This threat is
expected to remain sufficiently isolated to preclude watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...Latest regional radar imagery shows a gradual
maturation of convection across far northeast NY and across central
ME along/ahead of a cold front. Temperatures warming into the low
80s with dewpoints in the upper 60s to low 70s is slowly eroding
inhibition with MLCAPE increasing to around 500-1000 J/kg region
wide. This warming trend should continue and will promote further
thunderstorm intensification over the next couple of hours. 30-40
knot mid-level winds in proximity to a weakening upper trough are
supporting sufficient hodograph elongation for organized convection.
While convective mode will likely transition to predominantly a
semi-organized convective band due to strong flow along the
initiating cold front, an initial supercell or two appears possible
and may pose a severe hail/wind risk through the afternoon -
especially across central ME where forcing for ascent is currently
more nebulous. With time, strong to severe winds should become the
predominant hazard as a band of storms begins to emerge. Despite
these concerns, the overall severe threat is expected to remain
sufficiently isolated to preclude watch issuance.

SUMMARY...Large hail, damaging winds, and perhaps a tornado are
possible this afternoon/evening. Watch issuance is possible.

DISCUSSION...Regional satellite/radar show convection developing
along a cold front positioned from northeast North Dakota extending
southwestward, and along a warm front extending into northeast
Minnesota. This activity is developing in a region where skies have
remained clear in proximity to passing cirrus clouds to the
immediate south. In addition, cool mid-level temperatures are
overspreading the region, in association with an upper-level trough.
These factors are contributing to destabilization that is yielding
MLCAPE values near 1500 J/kg. Ample effective shear of 40-45 kt is
also present, associated with the aforementioned trough.

Storms are expected to continue increasing in coverage and severity
throughout the afternoon and into the evening. Large hail and
damaging wind gusts will be the primary threats. A tornado will also
be possible with any storm that can favorably interact with
aforementioned warm front. Coverage of storms remains uncertain in
the short term, given the extent of the cirrus shield limiting
destabilization. However, at least some CAM solutions suggest
greater coverage may materialize. Thus, convective trends will be
monitored for possible watch issuance this afternoon/evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 1592
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0223 PM CDT Mon Jul 07 2025

Areas affected...northeast Colorado...far southeast
Wyoming...southwest Nebraska...and northwest Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 071923Z - 072130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered severe storms expected by mid/late afternoon,
posing a threat for severe wind/hail. Watch possible.

DISCUSSION...Visible satellite show a broad area of terrain
generated convection over the mountains of central/northern Colorado
into far southeast Wyoming. Additional convection is now forming
downstream of this activity, along the lee of the Rockies. Clear
skies have promoted strong insolation amid a relatively moist
low-level airmass for the central High Plains, with dew point
temperatures in the mid/upper 50s F. This is contributing to an
west-to-east instability gradient, with MLCAPE values approaching
1500 J/kg in far northeast Colorado. Surface observations also
indicate a weak upslope flow regime in this region in advance of a
stalling cold front across the panhandle of Nebraska.

The aforementioned convection should continue to develop and
propagate eastward off the high terrain with time. As this occurs,
storms will encounter greater instability as MLCAPE values are
forecast to approach 2000-2500 J/kg. Effective shear is forecast to
increase throughout the afternoon/evening, approaching 35-45 kt.
This will help to promote storm organization into
supercell/multicell modes, with damaging winds and severe hail
expected. With time, cold pools may promote upscale growth into an
MCS this evening, transitioning into more of a damaging wind threat.
Given this potential, the area is being monitored for possible watch
issuance this afternoon.

Areas affected...north-central North Carolina into far southern
Virginia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 062044Z - 062215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A brief tornado or strong wind gust will remain possible
with the convection near the remnant core of TD Chantal.

DISCUSSION...Afternoon imagery shows the remnants of TD Chantal
located across portions of north-central NC near 34.4 deg N 79.2 deg
W. Within the broader precip shield, a few deeper convective towers
have remained strong with occasional cyclonic rotation observed.
Enhanced low-level shear (0-1km SRH near 200 m2/s2) near the remnant
center will remain strong enough to support occasional low-level
mesocyclones with this convection. Despite weak buoyancy (MLCAPE
(~500 J/kg) the moist surface environment and some deeper storms may
remain capable of a brief tornado two and damaging gust into this
evening. Widespread severe weather is not anticipated, and the
interaction of the circulation with higher terrain to the west
should slowly limit the threat tonight.

0326 PM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025

Areas affected...portions of northern Maine

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 062026Z - 062200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated to widely scattered thunderstorms, including a
few supercells, may pose a risk for damaging gusts and small hail
this afternoon/evening. A WW is unlikely.

DISCUSSION...As of 2020 UTC, regional radar and satellite imagery
showed convection was strengthening across portions of Maine. As
temperatures have warmed into the upper 70s to low 80s, around 1000
J/kg of MLCAPE has developed with dewpoints in the 60s. While not
overly strong, this buoyancy should continue to support occasional
stronger updrafts with convection across the region. Deep-layer
shear is supportive of storm organization with the KCBW VAD showing
an elongated hodograph and 30-45 kt of bulk shear. Weak mid-level
rotation has already been observed and the environment suggests a
few supercell/organized multi cell structures are possible. With
poor lapse rates and relatively limited buoyancy, damaging gusts
still appear to be the primary risk. However, some small hail and a
brief tornado are possible with the stronger rotating storms.

HRRR guidance and observations suggests additional storm
development/intensification is plausible this afternoon with more
storms developing/moving in from eastern Canada this evening. While
some severe risk is possible, confidence in severe coverage is low
owing to weak forcing and limited buoyancy. Convective trends are
being monitored, but a WW is currently unlikely.

Areas affected...Eastern New Mexico

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 061918Z - 062145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms emanating off the southern Rockies will pose
an isolated severe wind/hail threat through the late afternoon and
early evening hours. Watch issuance is not expected.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm development within the Sangre de Cristo
and Sacramento mountains is evident in recent GOES imagery. Weak
mid-level flow over the region will likely result in slow storm
propagation off the higher terrain, but as this occurs storms will
eventually move into an unseasonably moist air mass downstream
(dewpoint values in the 75th-90th percentile for early July). This
moisture is contributing to around 1000-1500 J/kg MLCAPE that should
promote thunderstorm maintenance, and possibly intensification,
through late evening. A combination of semi-discrete cells and
propagating clusters is expected with an attendant threat for
isolated large hail (most likely near/below 1.25 inch in diameter)
and sporadic severe wind gusts. The overall severe threat is
expected to remain relatively isolated given the modest kinematic
environment, which should preclude the need for watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1578
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0138 PM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025

Areas affected...Northeast Colorado to southeast Wyoming and western
Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 061838Z - 062115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms developing within the higher terrain of the
central Rockies will spread east and intensify through the
afternoon. As this occurs, the threat for severe winds, and possibly
large hail, will increase. Watch issuance is probable later this
afternoon as thunderstorms increase in coverage and intensity.

DISCUSSION...Latest GOES imagery and lightning data shows a gradual
uptick in convection within the higher terrain of central to
northern CO and far southern WY as daytime heating drives increasing
orographic ascent within a weakly capped air mass. This initial
activity is expected to spread east into the High Plains over the
coming hours given 30-40 knot westerly flow within the CAPE-bearing
layer. Storm intensification is expected as convection overspreads a
relatively moist low-level air mass (dewpoints remain in the mid to
upper 50s downstream) and as lingering inhibition is removed via
deepening boundary-layer heating/mixing. 

Across southeast WY and western NE, slightly stronger zonal flow
aloft coupled with weak easterly low-level winds should promote
adequate deep-layer shear for a couple of supercells with an
attendant large hail risk (possibly up to 2 inches in diameter). The
tornado threat may also be locally greatest across this region due
to augmented low-level shear/SRH on the immediate cool side of a
residual outflow boundary emanating out of central NE.

Further south across CO, observed dewpoint depressions and
short-term forecast soundings suggest LCL heights should approach
2.5 to 3 km as temperatures warm into the upper 80s, which will
promote strong downdraft evaporative cooling and accelerations as
well as rapid cold pool production. Strong to severe downburst winds
and sporadic large hail appear likely within initially discrete
cells moving off the terrain and/or developing within the DCVZ, but
upscale growth into organized clusters is anticipated later this
afternoon/evening with a more widespread severe wind risk (with
gusts possibly as high as 70-80 mph). Watch issuance is probable as
these threats begin to emerge in the coming hours.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 489
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
120 PM MDT Sun Jul 6 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northeast Colorado
  Nebraska Panhandle
  Southeast Wyoming

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 120 PM until
  800 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 75
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 2 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will intensify through the afternoon off the
foothills of northeast Colorado and southeast Wyoming.  A few severe
storms are expected, capable of large hail and damaging wind gusts
through the early evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles east and west of a line from 15 miles east northeast
of Torrington WY to 50 miles south southeast of Limon CO. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 65 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
27030.

Mesoscale Discussion 1575
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0751 AM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025

Areas affected...east North Carolina

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 061251Z - 061515Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A marginal increase in tornado potential may occur this
morning as Tropical Storm Chantal continues to move inland. The
overall tornado potential should remain low enough to preclude the
need for a TC-related Tornado Watch. However, trends will be
monitored.

DISCUSSION...A marginal increase in tornado potential may occur this
morning as Tropical Storm Chantal continues to move inland. This
marginal increase would coincide with modest diurnal heating
increasing and several feeder bands streaming inland on the eastern
semicircle of Chantal. The onshore environment containing these
feeder bands has little instability at present and the low-level
storm-relative helicity is on the lower side of land-falling
tropical cyclones. That said, the low-level storm-relative helicity
still remains sufficient for low-level rotation with stronger
thunderstorm updrafts. Present thinking is that the limited
instability and modest low-level helicity should preclude any longer
duration/larger area tornado threat and thus a TC-related tornado
watch is not currently anticipated. However, trends will continue to
be evaluated for increasing buoyancy and/or low-level helicity.

Mesoscale Discussion 1574
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0714 AM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025

Areas affected...southwest South Dakota and north-central Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 061214Z - 061415Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Ongoing thunderstorms should persist for another couple of
hours before weakening. Isolated hail and a damaging wind gust or
two will remain possible in the near term. A watch is not currently
expected.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms continue this morning across southwest
South Dakota along the southwest portion of a remnant MCS that moved
across this region overnight. These thunderstorms appear to be
driven by isentropic ascent focused atop a residual cold pool left
over from the overnight convection. This shows up as strong warm-air
advection centered around 700 MB in regional mesoanalysis.
Mesoanalysis also indicates a rich CAPE reservoir to the southwest
of the ongoing storms, within the thunderstorm source/inflow region,
providing additional buoyancy. With time, diurnal heating should
begin to modify the existing cold pool and weaken the isentropic
ascent/WAA leading to a downward trend in thunderstorm intensity.
Before this weakening occurs, lapse rates do not appear particular
steep this morning per RAP-model forecast soundings, and an
isotherms layer extends upward from the surface to around 800 mb.
This should limit the severe potential to isolated hail and perhaps
a damaging wind gust or two -- realistically only in the most
intense cores.

A watch is not anticipated.
