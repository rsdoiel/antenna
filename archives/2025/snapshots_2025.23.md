## WWDC: Apple supercharges its tools and technologies for developers

date: 2025-06-09, updated: 2025-06-09, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/apple-supercharges-its-tools-and-technologies-for-developers/">WWDC: Apple supercharges its tools and technologies for developers</a></strong></p>
Here's the Apple press release for today's WWDC announcements. Two things that stood out to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Foundation Models Framework</strong></p>
<p>With the Foundation Models framework, developers will be able to build on Apple Intelligence to bring users new experiences that are intelligent, available when they‚Äôre offline, and that protect their privacy, using AI inference that is free of cost.
The framework has native support for Swift, so developers can easily access the Apple Intelligence model with as few as three lines of code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's new documentation on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/FoundationModels/generating-content-and-performing-tasks-with-foundation-models">Generating content and performing tasks with Foundation Models</a> - the Swift code looks like this:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-k">let</span> <span class="pl-s1">session</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-en">LanguageModelSession</span><span class="pl-kos">(</span>
    instructions<span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-s">"</span><span class="pl-s">Reply with step by step instructions</span><span class="pl-s">"</span>
<span class="pl-kos">)</span>
<span class="pl-k">let</span> <span class="pl-s1">prompt</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s">"</span><span class="pl-s">Rum old fashioned cocktail</span><span class="pl-s">"</span>
<span class="pl-k">let</span> <span class="pl-s1">response</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-c1"><span class="pl-k">try</span></span> <span class="pl-k">await</span> session<span class="pl-kos">.</span><span class="pl-en">respond</span><span class="pl-kos">(</span>
    to<span class="pl-kos">:</span> prompt<span class="pl-kos">,</span>
    options<span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-en">GenerationOptions</span><span class="pl-kos">(</span>temperature<span class="pl-kos">:</span> <span class="pl-c1">2.0</span><span class="pl-kos">)</span>
<span class="pl-kos">)</span></pre>

<p>I'm also <em>very</em> excited about this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Containerization Framework</strong></p>
<p>The Containerization framework enables developers to create, download, or run Linux container images directly on Mac. It‚Äôs built on an open-source framework optimized for Apple silicon and provides secure isolation between container images. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I continue to seek the ideal sandboxing solution for running untrusted code - both from other humans and written for me by LLMs - on my own machines. This looks like it could be a really great option for that going forward.

## OpenAI hits $10 billion in annual recurring revenue fueled by ChatGPT growth

date: 2025-06-09, updated: 2025-06-09, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/09/openai-hits-10-billion-in-annualized-revenue-fueled-by-chatgpt-growth.html">OpenAI hits $10 billion in annual recurring revenue fueled by ChatGPT growth</a></strong></p>
Noteworthy because OpenAI revenue is a useful indicator of the direction of the generative AI industry in general, and frequently comes up in conversations about the sustainability of the current bubble.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OpenAI has hit $10 billion in annual recurring revenue less than three years after launching its popular ChatGPT chatbot.</p>
<p>The figure includes sales  from the company‚Äôs consumer products, ChatGPT business products and its application programming interface, or API. It excludes licensing revenue from Microsoft and large one-time deals, according to an OpenAI spokesperson.</p>
<p>For all of last year, OpenAI was around $5.5 billion in ARR. [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So these new numbers represent nearly double the ARR figures for last year.

## Copying Spinoza

date: 2025-06-09, from: Ed Summers blog, Inkdroid

<p>
I‚Äôve run into <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza">Spinoza</a> a few
times, sometimes in unexpected places like <a
href="https://joyfulmilitancy.com/">Joyful Militancy</a>, but I‚Äôve not
yet spent any time reading his work. He popped up in a recent Between
the Covers <a
href="https://tinhouse.com/podcast/madeleine-thien-the-book-of-records/">podcast</a>
interview with <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeleine_Thien">Madeleine Thien</a>
about her new book <a
href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-book-of-records-madeleine-thien/21798601">The
Book of Records</a>. You‚Äôll have to listen to the interview, or read the
book, to get a sense of how the book works, but it‚Äôs my understanding
that the main character is a refugee, and yet was able to bring with her
three slim books from a series called <em>The Great Lives of
Voyagers</em>, one of which is about Spinoza, the others being about Du
Fu and Hannah Arendt. I believe that readings of these fictional books
form part of The Book of Records.
</p>
<p>
During the interview Thien was asked about the importance of these
stories, and friendships to her work as a writer‚Ä¶not only friendships
with contemporaries, but across time as well.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It‚Äôs certainly true when I placed all the stories side by side, or as
they began to weave through each other, that it became clear that all of
them are at times, many times, sometimes, saved by another, and none of
their work would reach us had these acts of friendship not occurred. And
Moriel asked about that idea of friendship across the centuries between
the living and the dead. I was always struck by Hannah Arendt writing
about Rahel Varnhagen and saying she was my best friend even though she
had died a hundred years ago before her. I often felt this with the
three figures who were moving around in the Sea, that they were amazed
that we wanted to sit with them, even if we didn‚Äôt always agree with
them, even if we might have quite serious critiques of some of their
ideas. But even then, the desire to value the teacher, to value the
teaching, and to understand what it was that each of us might be looking
for each time we sit with a text, with a person, with another human
being, <em>I only really feel like I was with Spinoza when I, over many
months, copied up Ethics.</em> I understood then the way the geometry
would work on a person‚Äôs mind, that it is such a step-by-step process,
that text. One thing really must be understood before one moves to the
next proposition. One has to draw the angles of the triangle and the
measurements and understand what a triangle is before one can begin to
‚Äúconstellate‚Äù it with other things. That‚Äôs very much how Ethics works.
It is this seed, that everything that it contains is in it from its
first axioms, its first propositions, and you can kind of unfold them
and see how that all works.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This idea of <em>copying</em> Spinoza‚Äôs Ethics in an effort to form an
understanding and a friendship with him is compelling: to get a copy of
Ethics, and a blank notebook, and just start copying it out. It‚Äôs my
understanding that the text takes shape in the form of axioms and
propositions that draw on geometry, in order to propose a ‚Äúhuman
geometry‚Äù? Of all the maths that I needed to do in school it was
geometric proofs that I always got the most enjoyment from. This made me
think it would be fun to try do this copying practice with others, to
meet and discuss, and share our notebooks and thoughts? But then again,
I imagine if it took Thien months to do the copying it would take me
<em>much</em> longer‚Ä¶so perhaps it would be best to just work at my own
pace, when I can, without the peer pressure?
</p>
<p>
Another thing I learned while reading about Spinoza‚Äôs <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinoza%27s_Ethics">Ethics,
Demonstrated in Geometric Order</a> on Wikipedia is that the first
translation into English was done by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Eliot">George Eliot</a> in
1883, and it was left unpublished until almost a hundred years later.
Spinoza wrote the book over 14 years and it was only published after he
died. According to Thien, it took her 9 years to write The Book of
Records. In this age of move fast and break things, the idea of doing
something restorative, over the course of years, is maybe what appeals
to me most.

## American Idiot(s)

date: 2025-06-08, from: Michael Moore's blog

There is an explanation to the madness we are witnessing &#8212; and, once again, the conscience of the country, the Pulitzer Prize winner Chris Hedges, tells us exactly what we don&#8217;t want to hear.

## History Repeats

date: 2025-06-08, from: furbo.org

I&#8217;ve been developing on Apple products for a long time: typing PEEK and POKE code from magazines into an Apple ][, figuring out how QuickDraw worked using the Inside Macintosh pre-prints, having my mind blown by Mac OS X and every new thing prefixed with &#8220;NS&#8221;, and then jailbreaking the first iPhone so I could [&#8230;]

## ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X handheld gaming PCs from Asus and Microsoft coming later this year

<p>The first Xbox-branded handhelds are on the way and, as expected, they&#8217;re not made by Microsoft&#8230; or at least the hardware isn&#8217;t.

## Qwen3 Embedding

date: 2025-06-08, updated: 2025-06-08, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen3-embedding/">Qwen3 Embedding</a></strong></p>
New family of embedding models from Qwen, in three sizes: 0.6B, 4B, 8B - and two categories: Text Embedding and Text Reranking.</p>
<p>The full collection <a href="https://huggingface.co/collections/Qwen/qwen3-embedding-6841b2055b99c44d9a4c371f">can be browsed</a> on Hugging Face. The smallest available model is the 0.6B Q8 one, which is available as a 639MB GGUF. I tried it out using my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-sentence-transformers">llm-sentence-transformers</a> plugin like this:</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-sentence-transformers
llm sentence-transformers register Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B
llm embed -m sentence-transformers/Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B -c hi | jq length
</code></pre>
<p>This output 1024, confirming that Qwen3 0.6B produces 1024 length embedding vectors.</p>
<p>These new models are the highest scoring open-weight models on the well regarded <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard">MTEB leaderboard</a> - they're licensed Apache 2.0.</p>
<p><img alt="Table showing ranking of embedding models with columns for Rank, Model name, Zero-shot performance, Memory Usage, Number of Parameters, Embedding Dimensions, and Max Tokens. Top models include gemini-embedding-001 at rank 1 with 99% zero-shot and 3072 embedding dimensions, Qwen3-Embedding-8B at rank 2 with 99% zero-shot and 4096 embedding dimensions, and several other Qwen3 variants. Most models show 99% zero-shot performance with green highlighting, except gte-Qwen2-7B-instruct at rank 6 which shows &quot;NA&quot; with red highlighting and a warning triangle icon." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/qwen3-mteb.jpg" /></p>
<p>You can also try them out in your web browser, thanks to a <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/en/index">Transformers.js</a> port of the models. I loaded <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/qwen3-web.jpg">this page in Chrome</a> and it fetched 560MB of model files and gave me an interactive interface for visualizing clusters of embeddings like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of a text embedding web application interface showing a &quot;Sentences&quot; panel on the left with various sample sentences about topics like cooking, technology, sports, finance, music, and history, a &quot;Labels&quot; section below listing these categories, and a &quot;Scatterplot&quot; visualization on the right displaying colored clusters of data points representing the embedded sentences grouped by topic, with an &quot;Embed &amp; Plot&quot; button at the bottom and instructions to &quot;Done! Hover over points to see sentences.&quot;" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/qwen3-web.jpg" />
