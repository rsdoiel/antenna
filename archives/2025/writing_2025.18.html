SF Picks from May 2025</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-08, from: Locus Magazine</p>
<p>
From our friends at AudioFile Magazine, we have the top new science
fiction audiobooks from May 2025.
</p>
<p>
The best science fiction is a mirror to aspects of our real lives, and
these audiobooks are no exception, featuring AI, authoritarian
governments, colonizing Mars, and more. If that sounds bleak, don’t
worry—there’s also an audiobook about the moon turning into actual
cheese. Skilled narrators strike just the right tone for each story,

On today’s episode, we speak to writer Brandon Osterman, whose short
script <em>The Naughty List</em> won last year’s Final Draft Big Break
Short Screenplay Category. As part of his prize package, he received a
consultation with Sav Rodgers, Marketing Manager for Seed&amp;Spark, the
film industry’s most popular crowdfunding platform. Sav joins the
conversation to tell us exactly what crowdfunding is and help all
writers understand that funding for their project is possible to
achieve. <br><br>“Who is your audience? At Seed&amp;Spark, we always say
that great crowdfunding is audience building first and fundraising
second. While there is definitely a fundraising need, finding your
audience is invaluable… Something that I always tell prospective
crowdfunders is you already have the tools you need to do this. You know
how to tell a story. You’re here because you’re a storyteller. You know
how to invite people in. You already know how to talk about yourself
persuasively,” says Sav Rodgers. <br><br>Osterman also shares his
journey creating his award-winning short script and gives advice to
writers who are thinking of creating their own short film
project.<br><br>“I don’t think there’s been a better time to be making
short format content than right now. The demand for it seems to be
expanding every time I turn around. I think if that’s something that
you’re interested in, go after it. You know, I think there are more
opportunities to distribute that form of content than there have ever
been. I think we’ve got a generation now that’s grown up with TikTok and
social media and much shorter, digestible content that, whether it’s
conditioning or just sort of lowering of attention spans, I think more
people are more tuned into short form content than they have ever been
before. It’s a really, really exciting time to be making shorts,” says
Osterman. <br><br>To hear more about the short filmmaking process and
crowdfunding, listen to the podcast.

Screenwriter
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1151425/?ref_=ttfc_fcr_wr_1">Alan
Trezza</a> discovered the concept for his new horror film <span
style="font-style: italic;">Rosario</span> during the pandemic. The
project went from concept to completed script in just four weeks in a
creative sprint fueled by 5 a.m. wake-ups and late-night writing
sessions.<br><br>It all started when he wondered what it would be like
to have to spend a night with a loved one’s body. This idea evolved
further when Trezza, the son of an immigrant, began examining cultural
assimilation in America.<br><br>These themes coalesced for <span

starring

Toubia</a> as a Wall Street stockbroker who returns to her deceased
grandmother’s apartment during a snowstorm. While waiting for EMTs to
collect the body, she uncovers a hidden chamber filled with occult
artifacts tied to dark rituals. It becomes a race against the sunrise
for her to break an ancestral curse.<br><br>We spoke with Trezza about
how he finished the screenplay so quickly, keeping the second act

“One of the things we talked a lot about in the room is that very rarely
do people set about their day saying, ‘Okay, I’m going to go do some
evil.’ But for most people, we’re all sort of the leads in our own
stories and we’re all crafting the narrative of who we want the world to
see us as. And we do start to believe that. You tell yourself these
stories about yourself that you want to be true and you move through the
world and you make decisions based on that narrative. And I think that
one of the things that as writers, we really try to do is get into the
shoes and the heads of the characters that we’re writing and really try
to break down why they’re doing what they’re doing and make it feel as
real and true as possible. The things that these characters believe – or
convince themselves that they believe – have to feel really real and
grounded to us,” says Katie Robbins, creator and co-showrunner of<em>
Good American Family</em>, on writing flawed characters who prefer to
live in fantasy, not reality. <br><br>On today’s episode of Write On, we
speak to Katie Robbins (creator) and Sarah Sutherland, co-showrunners on
the explosive limited series, <em>Good American Family</em>. The show
tells the story of a midwestern couple who adopts what they believe is
little girl with dwarfism. Soon they are in the midst of a battle fought
in the tabloids, the courtroom and ultimately their marriage. The show
is based on the real-life story of Natalia Grace that made many
headlines.<br><br>Robbins and Sutherland talk about the unusual yet
brilliant structure of telling various episodes from different
characters’ points of view, and how the tone changed when they got to
the episodes told from Natalia’s perspective. They also talked about the
messiness of writing a dysfunctional family while still keeping the
story grounded. <br> <br>“We all know family is this wonderful,
beautiful thing, but it’s so complex. And I think that it’s really hard
to talk about the complexities of family because we’re afraid to
undermine the sacredness of it. It’s my view that if we are actually
more open about what is hard about coexisting as a unit who loves each
other, but also what’s not perfect, it would make us all better. And I
think that that’s true both for family but also even for our enemies.
We’re not writing autobiographies, but I think that we take those very
real emotional experiences that we all have and then put them into a
story that is cinematic, that is more interesting than our lives, but
that is deeply steeped in those real moments of heartache and joy and
confusion,” says Sutherland. <br><br>To learn more, listen to the
podcast but be aware there are SPOILERS ahead. <br><br>

Thirty years ago, comic book movies were hardly popular. Batman seemed
to be the only reliable franchise character igniting the 1995 summer
with <em>Batman Forever</em>. <em>Spider-Man</em> in 2002 launched the
real possibility of superhero and comic book movies before the genre hit
the gas in 2008 with <em>Iron Man</em>. Studios and producers then dug
deep into the comic book world turning the obscure <em>Guardians of the
Galaxy</em> into a major piece of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and
also creating acclaimed television shows like <em>The Boys</em> and
<em>The Penguin</em>.

If a group of people have been trying to get something done for some
time without success, there are two possibilities: Either they’re

discovered a new tactic, or they’ve found some new coalition partners.
