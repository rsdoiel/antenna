review: ‘Noises Off’ brings humor to Geffen Playhouse with successfully
reimagined script</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>Much unlike its title, audiences of “Noises Off” will find themselves
laughing from beginning to end. Playing at the Geffen Playhouse through
March 9, the cast of “Noises Off” will slap, kiss and drink themselves
into oblivion, bringing a now-classically farcical time for theatergoers
to the heart of Westwood.</p>
