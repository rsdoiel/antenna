the exception: UCLA chemists discover caveat to century-old rule</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-18, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>

known as anti-Bredt olefins – which violate Bredt’s rule, a rule that
has stood for a hundred years – cannot have double bonds in specific
positions under certain conditions.</p>

into oblivion, bringing a now-classically farcical time for theatergoers
to the heart of Westwood.</p>
