Mesoscale Discussion 0446
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0351 PM CDT Fri Apr 11 2025

Areas affected...northern Florida

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 112051Z - 112315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Several storms may produce small hail and locally gusty
winds through late afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Surface temperatures have risen into the upper 70s to
near 80 F this afternoon, as temperatures aloft continue to cool. A
very steep lapse rate environment has developed with 500 mb
temperature to -20 C into parts of the FL Panhandle and northern FL.


A few thunderstorms have already formed along the surface trough
extending from the Panhandle into extreme southeast GA, with
indications of small/non-severe hail. Moisture is the limiting
factor to storm severity today, with low dewpoints spreading
southward. Even so, convective coverage may continue to increase
over the next couple hours as lapse rates are maximized. Although
low PWAT overall, the deepened boundary layer along with low
freezing levels and lengthy hodographs will work together to produce
primarily non-severe hail. Boundary layer winds remain relatively
weak, therefore any strong to potentially damaging gust would likely
be localized (but possibly aided by cold hail-laden outflow).

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0300 PM CDT Fri Apr 11 2025

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS...

Expanded Elevated highlights into portions of Arizona partially due
to increasingly dry fuel indices along the Mogollon Rim and into
northwestern Arizona within an ongoing severe to extreme drought in
some areas. Critical fire weather threat is still expected across
northeastern New Mexico into the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles.
Otherwise, the forecast (see below) for Elevated fire weather
conditions remains on track across the Florida Peninsula.

Dewpoints in the 40s within a shallow boundary layer should limit
minimum relative humidity values in the 25-35 percent range across
portions of the Midwest tomorrow. Southerly return flow of 20-30 mph
across the area could promote localized areas of Elevated fire
weather conditions.

..Williams/Weinman.. 04/11/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0122 AM CDT Fri Apr 11 2025/

...Synopsis...
The mid-level pattern should transition from western/central ridge
and eastern trough to western trough, central ridge, and eastern
trough. This will be the result of the eastern trough continuing to
move east toward the Atlantic at the same time as the western trough
continues east. This ridge should stretch from northern Mexico into
the Great Lakes, with a shortwave trough digging southeast into the
northern Rocky Mountains. 

Elevated to Critical fire weather conditions will develop across the
Southern Plains in response to an increase in westerly mid-level
flow on the southern periphery of the aforementioned Northern Rocky
Mountain trough and a subtropical jet. This downslope flow will
allow relative humidity to fall into the low teens (locally into the
upper-single digits) with gusty winds to near 35 mph across the
Critical area. 

Surrounding the Critical area will be a large area of Elevated.
Within the elevated, surface winds may not be as great as in the
corridor highlighted by the Critical area. This, coupled with ERC
values generally less than 80%, should preclude the need for
Critical delineation.

... Florida Peninsula ...

A dry, post-frontal airmass should be in place across much of the
region on Saturday. Much of the peninsula will see little if any
precipitation associated with the frontal passage on Friday. Thus,
fuels should continue to dry. The dry airmass should allow for
sufficiently strong flow to mix down to the surface to support
elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM NORTHERN
FLORIDA NORTHWARD TO SOUTHEASTERN VIRGINIA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorm potential will continue this
afternoon and evening from parts of north Florida and far southeast
Georgia to the eastern Carolinas and far southeast Virginia.

...Discussion...
The ongoing forecast continues to reflect the evolving convective
scenario across parts of the southeastern CONUS.  Within the broader
area of convection across this region, the strongest storms ongoing
at this time are indicated across portions central and eastern North
Carolina, where 500 to 1000 J/kg surface-based CAPE has evolved as a
result of afternoon heating beneath cool mid-level temperatures.  

Meanwhile, an increase in convection is occurring from southern
Georgia across north Florida and into the Panhandle, along a weak
surface front.  Limited/local severe risk may evolve across this
region in the next 1 to 2 hours.

Overall, any ongoing severe threat is forecast to diminish diurnally
this evening.

..Goss.. 04/11/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1128 AM CDT Fri Apr 11 2025/

...North Florida to the Eastern Carolinas and Far Southeast
Virginia...
A mid-level trough will continue amplifying today over the southern
Appalachians as one embedded speed maximum rotates northeastward
over the Carolinas, and an upstream shortwave trough digs
southeastward from the mid MS Valley into the Southeast. An
associated weak surface low will develop northeastward across
eastern NC and far southeast VA, while a trailing cold front moves
southeastward into north FL. Surface dewpoints generally in the low
to mid 50s, in combination with daytime heating beneath cold
mid-level temperatures, will support MLCAPE up to 500 J/kg with
minimal convective inhibition. Isolated to scattered thunderstorms
should develop this afternoon near the cyclone track across the
eastern Carolinas, and along the front in north FL. The weak
instability and relatively straight hodographs aloft suggest some
updraft organization will be possible, with an isolated threat for
hail and strong to damaging winds this afternoon/evening.

A few low-topped thunderstorms should also occur this afternoon over
the southern Appalachians. However, buoyancy and deep-layer shear
will be weaker compared to areas farther east/southeast, with a
limited overall severe threat.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0221 PM CDT Fri Apr 11 2025

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected on Sunday or Sunday night.

...Upper MS Valley/Great Lakes...
A mid-level shortwave trough across the northern Plains will amplify
as it moves into the Upper Midwest on Sunday. At the surface, an
area of low pressure will move generally from the central Plains
into the northern Great Lakes. A cold front will extend from this
surface low south and then southwest to the central Plains. Ahead of
this front, upper 50s to perhaps low 60s dewpoints are forecast
which should be result in weak surface based instability Sunday
afternoon. Guidance varies on the position of the surface low and
destabilization ahead of the front. Long/straight hodographs within
the cloud bearing layer should support some storm organization and
the potential for some strong to locally severe storms. However,
strong capping is forecast ahead of the front with thunderstorm
potential mostly confined near the surface low. Destabilization
should also be more limited farther north. Therefore, a narrow
corridor of an uncapped warm sector with sufficient destabilization
and shear for an isolated severe weather threat may exist, but is
unclear if/where this may occur at this time. 

  ...CO/KS...
A few thunderstorms are possible along and north of a cold front
across eastern Colorado and into western Kansas as a shortwave
trough transits the central Rockies. Moisture/instability is
expected to be limited which should keep any thunderstorm potential
isolated.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS NORTHERN WYOMING
AND SOUTHEAST MONTANA TO THE BLACK HILLS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe gusts are possible from the Big Horns to the Black
Hills during the late afternoon to mid-evening Saturday.

...Southeast Montana/northeast Wyoming to the Black Hills...
A mid-level shortwave trough across the Pacific Northwest/southern
British Columbia will advance east through the day Saturday. Height
falls across northern Wyoming and southeast Montana will lead to
strengthening ascent by late afternoon. Strong heating, featuring
temperatures in the low 70s, will support sufficient instability for
scattered thunderstorm activity. The deeply-mixed thermodynamic
profile will support the potential for some severe wind gusts from
this activity. This threat should quickly wane after sunset as the
boundary layer cools. 

...Mid-MO Valley to the Upper Midwest...
A synoptically strong and nocturnally enhanced low-level jet will
strengthen Saturday night across the central Plains. This will
result in strengthening isentropic ascent in addition to height
falls ahead of the approaching mid-level trough. Despite favorable
synoptic scale lift, most forecast soundings show limited moisture
and a lack of elevated instability. Some guidance has higher quality
moisture and develops isolated thunderstorms, but even if storms
develop, instability will likely be too weak to support more than
small hail.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1151 AM CDT Fri Apr 11 2025

Valid 111700Z - 121200Z

A cold front moving through Montana today will support gusty surface
winds from the west and northwest through the afternoon across
portions of northeastern Montana. Short range model guidance
suggests relative humidity dropping into the 20-25 percent range
this afternoon across northeastern Montana. These factors amid very
dry fuels resulted in a westward expansion of Elevated highlights
from the northern High Plains. A dry boundary layer associated with
modest post-frontal west winds crossing the Florida Peninsula along
with receptive fuels will continue to support an Elevated fire
weather threat today.

..Williams/Weinman.. 04/11/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0122 AM CDT Fri Apr 11 2025/

...Synopsis...
An amplified mid-level pattern will persist through today as the
western ridge builds into the Plains and the eastern trough deepens
in place. 

As the mid-level ridge builds into the Plains, a lee trough will
develop across the northern High Plains. This lee trough will induce
strong southerly flow across then northern Plains within a dry
return flow scenario. The result will be afternoon relative humidity
in the low twenties to mid teens and afternoon winds gusting to
25-30 mph. The limiting factor for upgrading to critical will be
relatively high fuel moisture, with ERC percentiles less than 80%
and more generally less than 60%.

Across the Florida peninsula, a surface cold front will move across
the region. In its wake, a dry post-frontal airmass will move in.
The dry airmass should support efficient mixing of stronger flow in
the 925-850 millibar layer resulting in several hours of gusty
winds.

AFTERNOON/EVENING FROM NORTH FLORIDA TO EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA AND
EXTREME SOUTHEAST VIRGINIA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to locally severe thunderstorms are possible from
the eastern Carolinas into southeast Virginia and across far
southeast Georgia and northern Florida.

...North FL to eastern NC this afternoon/evening...
A midlevel trough is in the process of amplifying over the southern
Appalachians as one embedded speed max rotates northeastward over
the Carolinas today, and an upstream speed max digs southeastward
from the mid MS Valley to the Southeast.  An associated surface
cyclone will develop northeastward across the eastern Carolinas
today, while a trailing cold front moves southeastward into north
FL.  Boundary-layer dewpoints in the low-mid 50s, in combination
with surface heating beneath cold (less than -20 C at 500 mb)
midlevel temperatures, will result in MLCAPE near 500 J/kg with
minimal convective inhibition.  Scattered thunderstorms are expected
to form this afternoon near the cyclone track across the eastern
Carolinas and along the front in north FL.  The weak buoyancy and
relatively straight hodographs suggest some storm organization will
be possible with a low-end threat for hail and strong outflow winds
for a few hours this afternoon/evening. 

A few low-topped thunderstorms are also expected this afternoon over
the southern Appalachians.  However, buoyancy and vertical shear
will be weaker compared to areas farther east and southeast, and
only sub-severe hail/wind is expected.

Valid 141200Z - 191200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...D4/Monday...
Further amplification of a broadening mid/upper-level trough and
attendant surface cyclone is expected across the Upper Great Lakes
to the southern ON/QC border area. Poleward moisture quality from
the western Gulf will remain sub-optimal, but will continue to 
improve beneath a lobe of the southern Great Plains EML. The
northeast extent of weak surface buoyancy should overspread the OH
Valley by Monday afternoon. This portion of the front will coincide
with robust 700-500 mb southwesterlies, yielding potential for
fast-moving convection. Guidance consensus suggests this will remain
the favored corridor for at least a damaging wind threat. 

...D7/Thursday...
Guidance has trended towards greater amplification of a Prairie
Provinces to north-central CONUS upper trough, although run-to-run
continuity is quite poor. This would be accompanied by a cold front
sweeping southeast into the South-Central States. With potentially
greater low-level moisture relative to the D3-4 system, some severe
potential may become evident once predictability improves.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

CORRECTED FOR GRAPHIC

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected on Sunday or Sunday night.

...Upper MS Valley/Great Lakes...
A shortwave trough over the northern High Plains on Sunday morning
is expected to amplify as it moves east into the northern Upper
Midwest. This will maintain a deep surface cyclone from the central
Great Plains into the Upper Great Lakes. Guidance has above-average
spread across latest runs and poor run-to-run continuity on
placement of the cyclone Sunday afternoon. This will be crucial to
identifying a mesoscale corridor of surface-based severe threat,
given initially poor quality boundary-layer moisture relative to a
pronounced EML. The slower guidance with more northern
destabilization suggests that low-end severe potential is plausible
across a portion of the Upper MS Valley. Otherwise, rounds of
elevated convection are anticipated through the period within a
broad but persistent low-level warm theta-e advection regime.
Buoyancy should remain weak and be a limiting factor for large hail.

...CO/KS...
Atop an intensifying surface ridge nosing down the High Plains, a
favorably diffluent upper-level flow regime will become prevalent by
late afternoon Sunday and persist into Sunday night. This should
support a corridor of convection from CO into KS, that becomes
increasingly elevated given the undercutting surface front. Guidance
has above-average spread on the latitudinal extent of where
convection should form, yielding a broad low-probability thunder
area in this forecast.

Areas affected...eastern Tennessee...northern Georgia...extreme

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 102045Z - 102245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered storms, a few of which may be severe, are likely
to affect parts of northern Georgia and eastern Tennessee, and
possibly into the far western Carolinas by early evening.

DISCUSSION...Storms continue to increase across TN, beneath the
cooler midlevel temperatures. Meanwhile, a midlevel cloud band has
moved out of the region, allowing heating behind. Given this
expected destabilization via heating and advection out of the west,
cells moving into the region are expected to remain strong or
severe, producing hail and localized wind gusts. The greatest risk
of damaging hail will be over southern areas, including northern GA,
where temperatures have warmed substantially and lapse rates are
quite steep.

Mesoscale Discussion 0441
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0256 PM CDT Thu Apr 10 2025

Areas affected...primarily from northern Mississippi into central
and northern Alabama

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 101956Z - 102230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Storms are expected to develop later this afternoon and
evening, with large hail and localized damaging gusts likely.

DISCUSSION...Surface analysis shows a boundary/wind shift moving
south across AR and toward the MS River. Ahead of this boundary,
west/southwest winds are helping to maintain a plume of mid 50s F
dewpoints which now extend into AL. Meanwhile, strong heating
continues.

The southerly periphery of the midlevel cooling is evident on
visible imagery, indicated by the CU fields from northeast AR into
TN.  As this cooling aloft rapidly pushes southeast, corridors of
thunderstorm development are expected. The combination of strong
cooling aloft overspreading the surface theta-e plume should result
in corridors of severe storms. Long hodographs, cold temperatures
aloft, and favorable time of day coincident with peak heating will
favor both large hail and localized wind damage. Isolated
significant hail cannot be ruled out with the strongest cells.

Areas affected...Central/southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 072047Z - 072145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Some increase in convection may be sustained along the
deeper wind shift/cold front, but severe storms appear unlikely.

DISCUSSION...West of the pre-frontal convection, a recent increase
in updraft depth/intensity has occurred across central GA.  This
deepening convection appears to be along the deeper wind shift, with
a band of ascent impinging on residual moisture in the wake of
earlier convection.  However, the prior convection cooled surface
temperatures, lapse rates are poor, and vertical shear has
weakened/become more unidirectional with time, and shear vectors are
primarily parallel to the line orientation.  Thus, the storms are
expected to remain largely sub-severe, and an additional watch or
watch extension appears unnecessary.

0335 PM CDT Mon Apr 07 2025

Areas affected...parts of NC SC and southern VA

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 134...

Valid 072035Z - 072130Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 134
continues.

SUMMARY...The damaging wind threat continues across WW134, primarily
with the band of storms moving over eastern NC and southern VA.
However, additional storms remain possible farther south.

DISCUSSION...As of 2040 UTC, regional radar imagery shows an
organized linear cluster of thunderstorms ongoing from far
southeastern VA into eastern NC. Over the last 2 hours, several
reports of wind damage, and measured severe gusts have been reported
with the line segment across parts of VA and NC. This appears likely
to continue to the coast as the line segment moves east-northeast at
50 kt.

Farther south, lingering cloud cover has resulted in only isolated
weak convection and showers across parts of SC. Some recent CA
guidance suggests a few stronger cells may eventually emerge closer
to the coast where heating has been more pronounced. A damaging wind
gusts threat could evolve with any deeper connective cells that
become established in the next couple of hours as the primary cold
front continues to shift east.

Mesoscale Discussion 0433
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0740 AM CDT Mon Apr 07 2025

Areas affected...parts of swrn through e cntrl GA...wrn and cntrl SC

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 071240Z - 071445Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...At least low probabilities for an additional tornado or
two and/or locally damaging surface gusts continues in scattered
thunderstorm activity overspread the region through 10-11 AM EDT. 
It is still not clear that a severe weather watch is needed in the
near term, but trends will continue to be monitored for this
possibility.

DISCUSSION...Stronger boundary-layer instability, characterized by
CAPE near or above 1000 J/kg, still remains confined to a narrow
pre-frontal corridor across the western Florida Panhandle through
southwestern into southern portions of central GA.  However, some
cooling loft appears to be contributing to at least weak
destabilization north-northeastward toward the South Carolina
Piedmont.

The front, with a couple of weak waves along it, will continue a
slow eastward progression through mid to late morning, with the
Rapid Refresh indicating that a moderate south-southwesterly
low-level jet (in excess of 40 kt around 850 mb) will maintain
sizable, clockwise-curved low-level hodographs within the
instability axis.

Cloud cover spreading downstream of the stronger ongoing convective
development probably will slow boundary-layer destabilization, and
it is not certain that there will be a substantive further increase
in thunderstorm intensities in the near term.  However, the MCV,
which apparently recently contributed to a tornado south-southwest
of the Greater Atlanta area, continues east-northeastward toward the
South Carolina Piedmont, and it not clear that the downstream
environment will not support an additional relatively short-lived
tornado or two.  Farther south, in the corridor of better
instability, focused along the low-level jet axis near/north and
east of the Albany into Macon vicinities, there may also be
continuing potential for short-lived intensification of
meso-vortices embedded with the ongoing narrow band of convection.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 132
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1000 AM CDT Sun Apr 6 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Southern and Eastern Alabama
  Florida Panhandle
  Western and Northern Georgia
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Sunday morning and evening from 1000 AM until
  600 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Severe storm potential, including a few supercells ahead
of a convective line, may increase into the afternoon across the
region, with the strongest storms posing a tornado risk aside from
damaging winds.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 75 statute miles
east and west of a line from 25 miles north of Atlanta GA to 50
miles east of Mobile AL. For a complete depiction of the watch see
the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 131...

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 1 inch. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 24030.

Mesoscale Discussion 0428
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 PM CDT Sun Apr 06 2025

Areas affected...parts of southern AL...southwest/central GA...into
the western FL Panhandle

Concerning...Tornado Watch 132...

Valid 062048Z - 062215Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 132 continues.

SUMMARY...Several bands of strong to severe storms will remain
capable of damaging gusts and a couple tornadoes. Some local
extensions of WW132 may be needed, but the downstream threat appears
more limited.

DISCUSSION...As of 2040 UTC, regional radar observations indicate a
band of convection across southeastern AL and west-central GA
continues to show embedded supercell and bowing structures capable
of damaging gusts and tornadoes. This should continue for a couple
more hours as storms approach the eastern edge of the Tornado Watch
132. Areal extensions of a few counties may be needed as storms
begin to outrun the watch. As storms continue farther east, a
gradual decrease in buoyancy should favor weakening into the evening
hours. Until then, damaging gusts and a couple tornadoes remain
possible.

To the southwest, a second smaller band of convection across
southern AL will likely maintain intensity for a few more hours this
afternoon. A few more isolated cells have also developed farther
east within the warm sector across southwest GA and the northern FL
Panhandle. 1500-2000 J/kg of MLCAPE and 40+ kt of effective shear
could support a continued severe threat into this evening. This
matches with some hi-res guidance that shows a gradual expansion of
strong storms into southwest GA and possibly northern FL. However,
forcing for ascent is some what nebulous and storm coverage has
remained more isolated thus far. With storms approaching the
southeast corner of WW132 in the next few hours, some consideration
may be given to a small downstream watch. However the extent of the
severe risk and need for any new watches is currently unclear.

Mesoscale Discussion 0425
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0734 AM CDT Sun Apr 06 2025

Areas affected...parts of sern MS through cntrl AL

Concerning...Tornado Watch 131...

Valid 061234Z - 061430Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 131 continues.

SUMMARY...Convection may continue to undergo further organization
and intensification through 9-10 AM CDT, accompanied by increasing
risk for strong surface gusts, and a continuing risk for tornadoes.

DISCUSSION...At least a bit broader, lower/mid-tropospheric cyclonic
circulation appears to be evolving, perhaps including a surface
meso-low now migrating east-northeastward into/across the Demopolis
AL vicinity.  Latest Rapid Refresh now indicates a more prominent
south-southwesterly speed maximum associated with this feature,
including 50+ kt in the 850-700 mb layer.  Although moisture
characterized by mid 60s+ surface dew points across central Alabama,
between Montgomery and Birmingham still appear to supporting only
modest CAPE (around 500 J/kg sampled in 12Z BMX sounding), low-level
moisture advection and at least some boundary layer warming are
likely to contribute to further destabilization in advance of the
convection during the next few hours.  Inflow of this air mass may
be sufficient to support at least a gradual further intensification
of activity during the next few hours, accompanied by increasing
potential for strong surface gusts and a few tornadoes. 

Discrete thunderstorm development is also being maintained near/just
ahead of the southern flank of the evolving convective system, and
the occasional intensification of these cells, before merging into
the line, may also be accompanied by increasing potential for a
tornado near the Selma/Montgomery vicinities through mid morning.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 131
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
245 AM CDT Sun Apr 6 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Central and Southwest Alabama
  Northwest Georgia
  Far Southeast Mississippi

* Effective this Sunday morning from 245 AM until 1000 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms continue to gradually move southeastward
across the Southeast States. Low-level wind fields remain strong,
supporting the potential for damaging gusts and line-embedded
tornadoes. Additionally, there is also some chance for a few storms
ahead of the main line. Environmental conditions suggest that any
persistent discrete storms could become supercellular and capable of
producing damaging gusts and tornadoes.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 45 statute miles
north and south of a line from 135 miles southwest of Birmingham AL
to 15 miles southeast of Rome GA. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.
