Mesoscale Discussion 0433
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0740 AM CDT Mon Apr 07 2025

Areas affected...parts of swrn through e cntrl GA...wrn and cntrl SC

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 071240Z - 071445Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...At least low probabilities for an additional tornado or
two and/or locally damaging surface gusts continues in scattered
thunderstorm activity overspread the region through 10-11 AM EDT. 
It is still not clear that a severe weather watch is needed in the
near term, but trends will continue to be monitored for this
possibility.

DISCUSSION...Stronger boundary-layer instability, characterized by
CAPE near or above 1000 J/kg, still remains confined to a narrow
pre-frontal corridor across the western Florida Panhandle through
southwestern into southern portions of central GA.  However, some
cooling loft appears to be contributing to at least weak
destabilization north-northeastward toward the South Carolina
Piedmont.

The front, with a couple of weak waves along it, will continue a
slow eastward progression through mid to late morning, with the
Rapid Refresh indicating that a moderate south-southwesterly
low-level jet (in excess of 40 kt around 850 mb) will maintain
sizable, clockwise-curved low-level hodographs within the
instability axis.

Cloud cover spreading downstream of the stronger ongoing convective
development probably will slow boundary-layer destabilization, and
it is not certain that there will be a substantive further increase
in thunderstorm intensities in the near term.  However, the MCV,
which apparently recently contributed to a tornado south-southwest
of the Greater Atlanta area, continues east-northeastward toward the
South Carolina Piedmont, and it not clear that the downstream
environment will not support an additional relatively short-lived
tornado or two.  Farther south, in the corridor of better
instability, focused along the low-level jet axis near/north and
east of the Albany into Macon vicinities, there may also be
continuing potential for short-lived intensification of
meso-vortices embedded with the ongoing narrow band of convection.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0730 AM CDT Mon Apr 07 2025

Valid 071300Z - 081200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF
NORTH FLORIDA...SOUTHEAST GEORGIA...AND THE CAROLINAS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered storms, some severe, are possible today across parts of
northern Florida, southeast Georgia, and the Carolinas.

...Synopsis...
Positively titled upper troughing currently extends from Ontario
through central Mexico, with a shortwave trough embedded within this
larger trough from the Ozark Plateau through central Mexico. Strong
mid-level flow exists throughout the eastern periphery of the parent
troughing, with a jet max of 90+ kt at 500 mb extending from the
Mid-South into New England. 

Current surface pattern features a low near the northern TN/NC
border intersection, with another weaker low farther south near the
ATL vicinity. A modest cold front extends between these two lows,
becoming a bit more defined south of the second low due to outflow
augmentation from the ongoing storms. A warm front also extend
eastward from the northern low across southern VA. 

The southern shortwave trough is forecast to progress eastward
throughout the day, moving across the Lower MS Valley and Southeast
states before losing amplitude amid the more confluent flow across
the Carolinas. The primary surface low is expected to move
east-northeastward, with the cold front making steady eastward
progress. 

...North Florida/Southeast Georgia/Carolinas...
Airmass downstream of the ongoing convective line is currently
characterized by mostly mid 60s dewpoints, although some low 70s
exists across far southwest GA and the central FL Panhandle. This
low-level moisture is supporting modest buoyancy, despite poor lapse
rates. Some strengthening of the storms within the line has been
noted over the past hour as it interacts with a narrow corridor of
70s dewpoints across far southwest GA and the central FL Panhandle.
Bowing segments and embedded rotation has been observed briefly as
updraft intensity modulates. Given that these higher dewpoints exist
in a relatively narrow corridor, the threat for damaging gusts
and/or brief tornadoes is expected to remain short-lived this
morning.

Modest buoyancy is expected downstream of the cold front throughout
the day, with daytime heating helping to maintain this buoyancy
farther eastward into southeast GA and southern SC where lower
dewpoints are anticipated. In addition to this buoyancy, large-scale
forcing for ascent is expected to strengthen as well, both from the
approaching shortwave trough and favorable proximity within the
right entrance region of the strengthening mid-level flow. Moderate
to strong low-level southwesterly flow will persist throughout the
day.

All of these factors suggest the ongoing convective line should be
maintained as it moves eastward throughout the day, with some
additional strengthening and organization possible, particularly if
daytime heating does not overly mix the boundary layer. Deeper
convection is expected to expand northward along the front moves
into the Carolina Piedmont. A linear mode will likely be maintained,
with damaging gusts as the primary severe risk. The strength of the
low-level flow suggest some tornado potential exists as well.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0357 AM CDT Mon Apr 07 2025

Valid 101200Z - 151200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Days 4-5/Thursday-Friday...
A positively tilted large-scale trough will move slowly
east-southeastward across the Mid MS and OH Valleys on Day
4/Thursday. Ahead of the trough, partially modified Gulf moisture
will be returning ahead of a related front moving across the Lower
MS Valley. Thunderstorms are expected ahead of the front across
parts of the OH/TN Valleys, where weak buoyancy and strong midlevel
westerly flow will support an isolated severe-storm risk. However,
the limited low-level moisture and weak/veered low-level flow should
limit storm intensity. By Day 5/Friday, the midlevel trough will
take on a neutral tilt as it moves slowly eastward and amplifies
across the Appalachians. Preceding the trough, strong
south-southwesterly midlevel flow will overspread the partially
modified Gulf air mass over the coastal Mid-Atlantic -- where
isolated severe storms will be possible ahead of a related surface
front. Similar to Day 4/Thursday, the overall threat appears too
marginal for severe probabilities at this time.

...Days 7-8/Sunday-Monday...
A midlevel trough and strong west-southwesterly flow will overspread
the northern/central Plains on Day 7/Sunday, and continue across the
Midwest/Great Lakes on Day 8/Monday. In response, boundary-layer
moisture will return northward ahead of a related lee trough across
the southern and central Plains on Day 7/Sunday, though a strong EML
should limit thunderstorm potential. By Day 8/Monday, guidance
varies considerably on the evolution of the midlevel trough and
related warm sector, limiting confidence in overall severe-storm
potential.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1213 AM CDT Mon Apr 07 2025

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The upper-air pattern will transition toward more zonal flow
tomorrow (Tuesday) as surface high pressure overspreads the eastern
U.S. and a surface cyclone develops over the central Plains.
Isallobaric flow from the cyclone, along with downslope flow, will
support Elevated-equivalent surface conditions along portions of the
central and southern High Plains Tuesday afternoon. Despite the
presence of such dry and breezy conditions, fuel receptiveness is
expected to be quite marginal given recent wetting rainfall,
precluding fire weather highlights this outlook.

  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Sunday morning and evening from 1000 AM until
  600 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Severe storm potential, including a few supercells ahead
of a convective line, may increase into the afternoon across the
region, with the strongest storms posing a tornado risk aside from
damaging winds.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 75 statute miles
east and west of a line from 25 miles north of Atlanta GA to 50
miles east of Mobile AL. For a complete depiction of the watch see
the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 131...

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 1 inch. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 24030.

Mesoscale Discussion 0428
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 PM CDT Sun Apr 06 2025

Areas affected...parts of southern AL...southwest/central GA...into
the western FL Panhandle

Concerning...Tornado Watch 132...

Valid 062048Z - 062215Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 132 continues.

SUMMARY...Several bands of strong to severe storms will remain
capable of damaging gusts and a couple tornadoes. Some local
extensions of WW132 may be needed, but the downstream threat appears
more limited.

DISCUSSION...As of 2040 UTC, regional radar observations indicate a
band of convection across southeastern AL and west-central GA
continues to show embedded supercell and bowing structures capable
of damaging gusts and tornadoes. This should continue for a couple
more hours as storms approach the eastern edge of the Tornado Watch
132. Areal extensions of a few counties may be needed as storms
begin to outrun the watch. As storms continue farther east, a
gradual decrease in buoyancy should favor weakening into the evening
hours. Until then, damaging gusts and a couple tornadoes remain
possible.

To the southwest, a second smaller band of convection across
southern AL will likely maintain intensity for a few more hours this
afternoon. A few more isolated cells have also developed farther
east within the warm sector across southwest GA and the northern FL
Panhandle. 1500-2000 J/kg of MLCAPE and 40+ kt of effective shear
could support a continued severe threat into this evening. This
matches with some hi-res guidance that shows a gradual expansion of
strong storms into southwest GA and possibly northern FL. However,
forcing for ascent is some what nebulous and storm coverage has
remained more isolated thus far. With storms approaching the
southeast corner of WW132 in the next few hours, some consideration
may be given to a small downstream watch. However the extent of the
severe risk and need for any new watches is currently unclear.

Valid 062000Z - 071200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE SOUTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered damaging winds and isolated tornadoes remain possible
through this evening across parts of the Southeast. Marginally
severe wind gusts will also be possible northeastward into parts of
the southern Appalachians and southern Virginia.

...20Z Update...
The only appreciable change with this update was to trim severe
probabilities behind multiple ongoing convective clusters across the
Southeast. Damaging winds and a few tornadoes will remain the
primary severe concerns with this activity through about mid
evening, after which thunderstorms should tend to weaken.

..Gleason.. 04/06/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1126 AM CDT Sun Apr 06 2025/

...Southeast...
A composite squall line with some embedded bows, along with some
preceding thunderstorms and occasional transient/mostly weak
supercells thus far, extends from the Alabama/Georgia border
vicinity (west/southwest of Atlanta metro) southwestward into
east-central Alabama and southwest Alabama near Mobile as of 1130am
CDT/1230pm EDT. Multi-layer cloud cover extends across the nearby
warm sector to its east, but a moist environment (upper 60s/near
70F) and some additional heating will lead to further
destabilization, a change that should most appreciably occur
northeastward into western/north-central Georgia owing to
differential heating and essentially a northeastward-advancing warm
front. The strongest forcing for ascent and deep-layer winds will
lag (to the west-northeast) the composite convective line, but
sufficient vertical shear extends into the warm sector to support
organized storm modes including semi-discrete supercells and
line-embedded bows. Damaging wind and tornado risks will exist
through at least early/mid-evening.

...Southern Appalachians/Piedmont...
Warmer air aloft is expected to have a greater influence over these
regions. With less buoyancy anticipated through the afternoon,
convective intensity should remain muted. Given the strong shear
across these areas, a few strong to severe storms may produce
isolated wind damage.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF
EXTREME SOUTHERN FLORIDA AND THE KEYS...

...SUMMARY...
Marginally severe storms may occur Tuesday night over extreme
southern Florida.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
On Tuesday, a deep upper trough will exist over the Great Lakes and
Northeast, with a surface high spreading over much of the eastern
CONUS and Gulf of America. To the south, a southern-stream wave will
move across the Gulf and into FL overnight. Farther west, upper
ridging will occur over the southwestern states, with progressive,
low-amplitude shortwave trough affecting the northern Rockies and
High Plains. 

...Far southern FL...
A plume of midlevel moisture will stretch from the eastern Gulf
across FL for much of the day, with showers and scattered
thunderstorms both ahead of and north of the southward-moving cold
front. Forecast soundings reveal weak low-level winds, and marginal
levels of instability due to poor lapse rates aloft. For these
reasons severe storms are not forecast over most of FL. 

The exception may be overnight as the upper wave approaches. This
may result in increasing low-level winds and shear, though still not
strong. However, the increasing lift and moistening may result in a
cluster or two of stronger storms, possibly affecting parts of the
Keys or extreme southern FL with wind gust potential.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM NORTHERN
FLORIDA INTO MUCH OF SOUTHERN GEORGIA AND SOUTH CAROLINA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered storms, some severe, are possible Monday afternoon across
parts of northern Florida and the southern Atlantic Seaboard.

...Synopsis and Discussion...
A positive-tilt upper trough will sweep across the Southeast on
Monday, with midlevel jet max intensifying as it begins to phase
with a deeper trough over the Great Lakes. At the surface, a
pre-frontal trough will develop over the central Carolinas extending
south into GA, with mid 60s F dewpoints maintained. 

In concert with the strengthening midlevel wave, a 40-50 kt
low-level jet is forecast as well, with effective SRH over 200
m2/s2. Heating will steepen lapse rates and result in MUCAPE to
around 1000 J/kg ahead of the cold front, which will extend from the
western Carolinas into central GA at midday.

Scattered showers and storms are likely to be ongoing along the cold
front early, with rejuvenation potential as the activity and lift
encounter the warming air mass to the east. 

The primary mitigating issue will be very poor lapse rates aloft,
which will limit updraft strength. Still, favorable diurnal timing
and favorable shear should result in a at least isolated severe
storms with mainly wind potential. A brief tornado cannot be ruled
out with the strongest storms during the afternoon.

ensemble forecast guidance. As of 1630 UTC, surface observations
across the Florida peninsula indicate sustained southerly winds of
10-15 mph amidst RH values of 50-60%, with surface temperatures in
the low-to-mid 80s. Strong surface heating over the next few hours
should lead to very warm (near record) temperatures this afternoon,
with highs in the upper 80s to low 90s and corresponding minimum RH
values of 35-45%. Given receptive fuels across the area, Elevated
fire weather conditions appear likely for a few hours this
afternoon/evening before improving quickly by late evening as
temperatures decrease (RH values increase) and surface winds
subside.  

Please see the previous discussion below for more information on
today's fire weather forecast.

..Elliott.. 04/06/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0137 AM CDT Sun Apr 06 2025/

...Synopsis...
A strong mid-level shortwave trough will move eastward across the
southern Plains through the day on Sunday, inducing a surface low
pressure area across the southeast CONUS. The southerly flow ahead
of this surface low will bring a shallow modified air mass onshore
across the southeast US, and strong mixing will lower the RH. In
particular, across parts of the Florida peninsula, RH is expected to
be near 35-40% in the afternoon with some breezy conditions. Given
high KBDI values in the area, as well as fuel ERCs near the 90th
percentile, have maintained an Elevated area on the Florida
peninsula. Farther north across parts of Georgia, fuels are not as
receptive and RH is a bit higher, so have held off on introducing
Elevated highlights there.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1126 AM CDT Sun Apr 06 2025

Valid 061630Z - 071200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
SOUTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
A wind-damage and isolated tornado threat exists across parts of the
Southeast. Marginally severe wind gusts will also be possible
northeastward into parts of the southern Appalachians and southern
Virginia.

...Southeast...
A composite squall line with some embedded bows, along with some
preceding thunderstorms and occasional transient/mostly weak
supercells thus far, extends from the Alabama/Georgia border
vicinity (west/southwest of Atlanta metro) southwestward into
east-central Alabama and southwest Alabama near Mobile as of 1130am
CDT/1230pm EDT. Multi-layer cloud cover extends across the nearby
warm sector to its east, but a moist environment (upper 60s/near
70F) and some additional heating will lead to further
destabilization, a change that should most appreciably occur
northeastward into western/north-central Georgia owing to
differential heating and essentially a northeastward-advancing warm
front. The strongest forcing for ascent and deep-layer winds will
lag (to the west-northeast) the composite convective line, but
sufficient vertical shear extends into the warm sector to support
organized storm modes including semi-discrete supercells and
line-embedded bows. Damaging wind and tornado risks will exist
through at least early/mid-evening.

...Southern Appalachians/Piedmont...
Warmer air aloft is expected to have a greater influence over these
regions. With less buoyancy anticipated through the afternoon,
convective intensity should remain muted. Given the strong shear
across these areas, a few strong to severe storms may produce
isolated wind damage.

Mesoscale Discussion 0425
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0734 AM CDT Sun Apr 06 2025

Areas affected...parts of sern MS through cntrl AL

Concerning...Tornado Watch 131...

Valid 061234Z - 061430Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 131 continues.

SUMMARY...Convection may continue to undergo further organization
and intensification through 9-10 AM CDT, accompanied by increasing
risk for strong surface gusts, and a continuing risk for tornadoes.

DISCUSSION...At least a bit broader, lower/mid-tropospheric cyclonic
circulation appears to be evolving, perhaps including a surface
meso-low now migrating east-northeastward into/across the Demopolis
AL vicinity.  Latest Rapid Refresh now indicates a more prominent
south-southwesterly speed maximum associated with this feature,
including 50+ kt in the 850-700 mb layer.  Although moisture
characterized by mid 60s+ surface dew points across central Alabama,
between Montgomery and Birmingham still appear to supporting only
modest CAPE (around 500 J/kg sampled in 12Z BMX sounding), low-level
moisture advection and at least some boundary layer warming are
likely to contribute to further destabilization in advance of the
convection during the next few hours.  Inflow of this air mass may
be sufficient to support at least a gradual further intensification
of activity during the next few hours, accompanied by increasing
potential for strong surface gusts and a few tornadoes. 

Discrete thunderstorm development is also being maintained near/just
ahead of the southern flank of the evolving convective system, and
the occasional intensification of these cells, before merging into
the line, may also be accompanied by increasing potential for a
tornado near the Selma/Montgomery vicinities through mid morning.

## SPC Tornado Watch 131

date: 2025-04-06, from: NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/ww0131.html"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/ww0131_radar.gif" border="1" alt="WW 0131 Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="525" height="459" align="center" /></a><pre>

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 131
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
245 AM CDT Sun Apr 6 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Central and Southwest Alabama
  Northwest Georgia
  Far Southeast Mississippi

* Effective this Sunday morning from 245 AM until 1000 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms continue to gradually move southeastward
across the Southeast States. Low-level wind fields remain strong,
supporting the potential for damaging gusts and line-embedded
tornadoes. Additionally, there is also some chance for a few storms
ahead of the main line. Environmental conditions suggest that any
persistent discrete storms could become supercellular and capable of
producing damaging gusts and tornadoes.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 45 statute miles
north and south of a line from 135 miles southwest of Birmingham AL
to 15 miles southeast of Rome GA. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 128...WW 129...WW 130...

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 24035.
