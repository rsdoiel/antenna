<h2 id="supreme-court-roundup-revenge-of-the-six">Supreme Court Roundup:
Revenge of the Six</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: The Contrarian</p>
<p>It’s our annual end-of-term Supreme Court special episode of Talking
Feds Substack, with a roundtable of three of the most eminent Court
watchers in the country: Leah Litman, Melissa Murray, and Steve Vladeck.
The nationwide injunction case capped off a conservative juggernaut of a
term in which the 6 conservative justices expanded Executive power,
contracted individual rights, augmented the Court’s own power vis-a-vis
lower courts, and pretty much had their way in all important cases.</p>
