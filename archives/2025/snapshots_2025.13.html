<h2 id="pydantic-evals">Pydantic Evals</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-01, updated: 2025-04-01, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://ai.pydantic.dev/evals/">Pydantic
Evals</a></strong>
</p>
Brand new package from the Pydantic AI team which directly tackles what
I consider to be the single hardest problem in AI engineering: building
evals to determine if your LLM-based system is working correctly and
getting better over time.
</p>
<p>
The feature is described as “in beta” and comes with this very realistic
warning:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Unlike unit tests, evals are an emerging art/science; anyone who claims
to know for sure exactly how your evals should be defined can safely be
ignored.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This code example from their documentation illustrates the relationship
between the two key nouns - Cases and Datasets:
</p>
<pre><span class="pl-k">from</span> <span class="pl-s1">pydantic_evals</span> <span class="pl-k">import</span> <span class="pl-v">Case</span>, <span class="pl-v">Dataset</span>

<span class="pl-s1">case1</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-en">Case</span>(
    <span class="pl-s1">name</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"simple_case"</span>,
    <span class="pl-s1">inputs</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"What is the capital of France?"</span>,
    <span class="pl-s1">expected_output</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"Paris"</span>,
    <span class="pl-s1">metadata</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span>{<span class="pl-s">"difficulty"</span>: <span class="pl-s">"easy"</span>},
)

<span class="pl-s1">dataset</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-en">Dataset</span>(<span class="pl-s1">cases</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span>[<span class="pl-s1">case1</span>])</pre>
<p>
The library also supports custom evaluators, including LLM-as-a-judge:
</p>
<pre><span class="pl-en">Case</span>(
    <span class="pl-s1">name</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"vegetarian_recipe"</span>,
    <span class="pl-s1">inputs</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-en">CustomerOrder</span>(
        <span class="pl-s1">dish_name</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"Spaghetti Bolognese"</span>, <span class="pl-s1">dietary_restriction</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"vegetarian"</span>
    ),
    <span class="pl-s1">expected_output</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-c1">None</span>,
    <span class="pl-s1">metadata</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span>{<span class="pl-s">"focus"</span>: <span class="pl-s">"vegetarian"</span>},
    <span class="pl-s1">evaluators</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span>(
        <span class="pl-en">LLMJudge</span>(
            <span class="pl-s1">rubric</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"Recipe should not contain meat or animal products"</span>,
        ),
    ),
)</pre>
<p>
Cases and datasets can also be serialized to YAML.
</p>
<p>
<p>My first impressions are that this looks like a solid implementation
of a sensible design. I’m looking forward to trying it out against a
real project.</p>

<div class="pull-quote">
Everyone is a FAANG engineer

<p>I’m entirely convinced that basically every developer alive today
heard the adage “dress for the job you want, not the job you have” and
figured that, since they always wear jeans and a t-shirt anyway, they
might as well apply it to their systems’ architecture. This explains why
the stack of every single company I’ve seen is invariably AWS/GCP with
at least thirty microservices (how else will you keep the code tidy?), a
distributed datastore</p>

<strong><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/debug-gym/">debug-gym</a></strong>
</p>
New paper and code from Microsoft Research that experiments with giving
LLMs access to the Python debugger. They found that the best models
could indeed improve their results by running pdb as a tool.
</p>
<p>
They saw the best results overall from Claude 3.7 Sonnet against
<a href="https://www.swebench.com/lite.html">SWE-bench Lite</a>, where
it scored 37.2% in rewrite mode without a debugger, 48.4% with their
debugger tool and 52.1% with debug(5) - a mechanism where the pdb tool
is made available only after the 5th rewrite attempt.
</p>
<p>
Their code is <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/debug-gym">available
on GitHub</a>. I found this implementation of
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/debug-gym/blob/1.0.0/debug_gym/gym/tools/pdb.py">the
pdb tool</a>, and tracked down the main system and user prompt in
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/debug-gym/blob/1.0.0/debug_gym/agents/debug_agent.py">agents/debug_agent.py</a>:
</p>
<p>
System prompt:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>Your goal is to debug a Python program to make sure it can pass a
set of test functions. You have access to the pdb debugger tools, you
can use them to investigate the code, set breakpoints, and print
necessary values to identify the bugs. Once you have gained enough
information, propose a rewriting patch to fix the bugs. Avoid rewriting
the entire code, focus on the bugs only.</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
User prompt (which they call an “action prompt”):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>Based on the instruction, the current code, the last execution
output, and the history information, continue your debugging process
using pdb commands or to propose a patch using rewrite command. Output a
single command, nothing else. Do not repeat your previous commands
unless they can provide more information. You must be concise and avoid
overthinking.</code>

Hey everyone!

<p>
This is the list of all the changes we’ve done to our projects during
the month of March.

Summary Of Changes
</h2>
<p>
In the above illustration, little Ninj is going through a
<a href="https://rabbitwaves.ca/site/first_aid_kit.html" target="_blank">first-aid
kit</a>, looking through our supplies to see what needs to be topped off
and what is out-of-date. Rek drew a list of suggestions on what to
include in both a first-aid and a medical kit for the Rabbit Waves
project, we plan to add more items soon(thanks to everyone on Mastodon
who suggested additions! It’ll be in the April update).
</p>
<p>
We will spend the first few days of April participating in
<a href="https://itch.io/jam/flickjam-2025" target="_blank">Flickjam</a>,
making small games in the style of
<a href="https://www.flickgame.org/index.html" target="_blank">Flickgame</a>,
a tool originally made by Increpare, in which the world is navigated by
clicking on pixels of different colors to head in different directions.
Devine ported
<a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/flick.html" target="_blank">Flickgame
to Varvara</a>, and wrote a compiler for flick games to uxn roms.
</p>
<p>
This past month, Rek finished transcribing the entire 15 weeks of the
<a href="../site/victoria_to_sitka_logbook.html">Victoria to Sitka
logbook</a>! We have plans to turn it into a book, in the style of
<a href="../site/busy_doing_nothing.html">Busy Doing Nothing</a>, with
tons of extra content and illustrations.
</p>
<p>
March was a very good month for silly
<a href="https://rabbits.srht.site/days/2025/03/31.html" target="_blank">calendar
doodles</a>. Our paper calendar is always in view, it documents
important events like releases, appointments, as well as food, memes,
and other noteworthy things that happened on each day.

My advice about using AI is simple: use AI as an assistant, not an
expert, and use it judiciously. Some people will object, “but AI can be
wrong!” Yes, and so can the internet in general, but no one now
recommends avoiding online resources because they can be wrong. They
recommend taking it all with a grain of salt and being careful. That’s
what you should do with AI help as well.

<h2 id="minimal-css-only-blurry-image-placeholders">Minimal CSS-only
blurry image placeholders</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-30, from: Lean Rada’s blog</p>
<p>
Here’s a CSS technique that produces blurry image placeholders (LQIPs)
without cluttering up your markup — <em>Only a single custom property
needed!</em>
</p>
<card-box> <code-block language="html">
<pre><code>&lt;img src="…" style="--lqip:192900"&gt;</code></pre>
<p></code-block></p>
<p>
The custom property above gives you this image:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<div>

</div>
<p>
</p>
<label> Try changing the property’s value <strong>(WARNING:
FLASHING)</strong> <input type="range" min="-999999" max="999999">
</label>
<script>
    {
      const card = document.currentScript.parentElement;
      const input = card.querySelector("input");
      const code = card.querySelector("code");
      const preview = card.querySelector("div");

      let currentValueStr = "192900";
      let targetCode = null

      input.addEventListener("input", event => {
        if (!targetCode) {
          targetCode = Array.from(code.querySelectorAll("span")).filter(el => el.textContent.includes(currentValueStr)).slice(-1)[0] ?? code;
        }

        const lqip = Number(event.currentTarget.value);
        // use this page's lqip to avoid breakage if I ever update the scheme
        preview.style.setProperty("--my-lqip", lqip);
        targetCode.innerHTML = targetCode.innerHTML.replace(currentValueStr, lqip);
        currentValueStr = String(lqip);
      });
    }
  </script>
</card-box>
<p>
Granted, it’s a <em>very blurry</em> placeholder especially in contrast
to other leading solutions. But the point is that it’s minimal and
non-invasive! No need for wrapper elements or attributes with long
strings of data, or JavaScript at all.

<h2>
Survey of LQIP approaches
</h2>
<p>
There have been many different techniques to implement LQIPs (low
quality image placeholders), such as a very low resolution WebP or JPEG
(<a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2015/08/06/android/the-technology-behind-preview-photos/" target="_blank">beheaded
JPEGs</a> even), optimised SVG shape placements
(<a href="https://github.com/axe312ger/sqip" target="_blank">SQIP</a>),
and directly applying a discrete cosine transform
(<a href="https://blurha.sh/" target="_blank">BlurHash</a>). Don’t
forget good old progressive JPEGs and interlaced PNGs!
</p>

<figcaption>
Canva and Pinterest use solid colour placeholders.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
At the other end of the spectrum, we have low tech solutions such as a
simple solid fill of the image’s average colour.
</p>
<p>
Pure inline CSS solutions have the advantage rendering immediately —
even a <code>background-image: url(…a data URL)</code> would be fine!
</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/css-only-lqip/gradient-css.png?ref=rss" alt="image gallery with gradient placeholders" width="1368" height="832">
<figcaption>
<a href="https://github.com/fraser-hemp/gradify" target="_blank">Gradify</a>
generates linear-gradients that very roughly approximate the full image.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
The big disadvantage of pure CSS approaches is that you typically litter
your markup with lengthy inline styles or obnoxious data URLs. My
handcoded site with no build step would be extra incompatible with this
approach!
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- typical gradify css --&gt;
&lt;img width="200" height="150" style="
  background: linear-gradient(45deg, #f4a261, transparent),
    linear-gradient(-45deg, #e76f51, transparent),
    linear-gradient(90deg, #8ab17d, transparent),
    linear-gradient(0deg, #d62828, #023047);
"&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://blurha.sh/">BlurHash</a></strong> is a solution
that minimises markup by compressing image data into a <strong>short
base-83 string</strong>, but decoding and rendering that data requires
additional JS…
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- a blurhash markup --&gt;
&lt;img width="200" height="150" src="…"
  data-blurhash="LEHV6nWB2yk8pyo0adR*.7kCMdnj"&gt;</code></pre>

BlurHash example
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Is it possible to decode a blur hash in CSS instead?
</p>
<h2>
Decoding in pure CSS
</h2>
<p>
Unlike BlurHash, we can’t use a string encoding because there are very
few if any string manipulation functions in CSS (2025), so strings are
out.
</p>
<p>
In the end, I came up with my own hash / encoding, and the
<b>integer</b> type was the best vessel for it.
</p>
<p>
The usual way to encode stuff in a single integer is by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_manipulation" target="_blank"><strong>bit
packing</strong></a>, where you pack multiple numbers in an integer as
bits. Amazingly, we can unpack them in pure CSS!
</p>
<p>
To unpack bits, all you need is bit shifting and bit masking.
<strong>Bit shifting</strong> can be done by division and floor
operations — <code>calc(x / y)</code> and <code>round(down,n)</code> —
and <strong>bit masking</strong> via the modulo function
<code>mod(a,b)</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>* {
/* Example packed int: */
/* 0b11_00_001_101 */
--packed-int: 781;
--bits-9-10: mod(round(down, calc(var(--packed-int) / 256)), 4); /* 3 */
--bits-7-8: mod(round(down, calc(var(--packed-int) / 64)), 4); /* 0 */
--bits-4-6: mod(round(down, calc(var(--packed-int) / 8)), 8); /* 1 */
--bits-0-3: mod(var(--packed-int), 8); /* 5 */
}</code></pre>
<p>
Of course, we could also use <code>pow(2,n)</code> instead of hardcoded
powers of two.
</p>
<p>
So, a <strong>single CSS integer value</strong> was going to be the
encoding of the “hash” of my CSS-only blobhash (that’s what I’m calling
it now). But how much information can we pack in a single CSS int?
</p>
<h2>
Side quest: Limits of CSS values
</h2>
<p>
The spec doesn’t say anything about the allowed range for int values,
leaving the fate of my shenanigans to browser vendors.
</p>
<p>
From my experiments, apparently you can only use integers from
<strong>-999,999 up to 999,999</strong> in custom properties before you
lose precision. Just beyond that limit, we start getting values rounded
to tens — 1,234,56<del>7</del> becomes 1,234,56<ins>0</ins>. Which is
weird (precision is counted in decimal places!?), but I bet it’s due to
historical, Internet Explorer-esque reasons.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, within the range of [-999999, 999999] there are
<strong>1,999,999</strong> values. This meant that with a single integer
hash, almost two million LQIP configurations could be described. To make
calculation easier, I reduced it to the nearest power of two down which
is 2<sup>20</sup>.
</p>
<card-box> <code>2<sup>20</sup> = 1,048,576 &lt; 1,999,999 &lt;
2,097,152 = 2<sup>21</sup></code> </card-box>
<p>
<strong>In short, I had 20 bits of information to encode the CSS-based
LQIP hash.</strong>
</p>
<box-note><strong>Why is it called a “hash”?</strong> Because it’s a
mapping from an any-size data to a fixed-size value. In this case, there
are an infinite number of images of arbitrary sizes, but only 1,999,999
possible hash values.</box-note>
<h2>
The Scheme
</h2>
<p>
With only 20 bits, the LQIP image must be a very simplified version of
the full image. I ended up with this scheme: a single base colour + 6
brightness components, to be overlaid on top of the base colour in a 3×2
grid. A rather extreme version of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_subsampling" target="_blank">chroma
subsampling</a>.
</p>
<p><img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/css-only-lqip/scheme.png?ref=rss" alt="illustration of encoded components" width="600" height="500"></p>
<p>
This totals <strong>9 numbers</strong> to pack into the 20-bit integer:
</p>
<p>
The <strong>base colour</strong> is encoded in the <strong>lower 8
bits</strong> in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklab_color_space" target="_blank">Oklab
colour space</a>. 2 bits for luminance, and 3 bits for each of the a and
b coordinates. I’ve found Oklab to give subjectively balanced results,
but RGB should work just as well.
</p>
<p>
The <strong>6 greyscale components</strong> are encoded in the
<strong>higher 12 bits</strong> — 2 bits each.
</p>
<p>
An offline script was created to compress any given image into this
integer format. The script was quite simple: Get the average or dominant
colour — there are a lot of libraries that can do that — then resize the
image down to 3×2 pixels and get the greyscale values.
<a href="https://github.com/Kalabasa/leanrada.com/blob/7b6739c7c30c66c771fcbc9e1dc8942e628c5024/main/scripts/update/lqip.mjs#L118-L159" target="_blank">Here’s
my script.</a>
</p>
<box-note>I even tried a
<a href="https://blog.4dcu.be/programming/2020/01/12/Genetic-Art-Algorithm.html" target="_blank">genetic
algorithm</a> to optimise the LQIP bits, but the fitness function was
hard to establish. Ultimately, I would’ve needed an offline CSS renderer
for this to work accurately. Maybe a future iteration could use some
headless Chrome solution to automatically compare real renderings of the
LQIP against the source image.</box-note>
<p>
Once encoded, it’s set as the value of <code>–lqip</code> via the style
attribute in the target element. It could then be decoded in CSS. Here’s
the actual code I used for decoding:
</p>
<pre><code>[style*="--lqip:"] {
--lqip-ca: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 18))), 4);
--lqip-cb: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 16))), 4);
--lqip-cc: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 14))), 4);
--lqip-cd: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 12))), 4);
--lqip-ce: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 10))), 4);
--lqip-cf: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 8))), 4);
--lqip-ll: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 6))), 4);
--lqip-aaa: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 3))), 8);
--lqip-bbb: mod(calc(var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)), 8);</code></pre>
<p>
Before rendering the decoded values, the raw number data values need to
be converted to CSS colours. It’s fairly straightforward, just a bunch
linear interpolations into colour constructor functions.
</p>
<pre><code>/* continued */
--lqip-ca-clr: hsl(0 0% calc(var(--lqip-ca) / 3 * 100%));
--lqip-cb-clr: hsl(0 0% calc(var(--lqip-cb) / 3 * 100%));
--lqip-cc-clr: hsl(0 0% calc(var(--lqip-cc) / 3 * 100%));
--lqip-cd-clr: hsl(0 0% calc(var(--lqip-cd) / 3 * 100%));
--lqip-ce-clr: hsl(0 0% calc(var(--lqip-ce) / 3 * 100%));
--lqip-cf-clr: hsl(0 0% calc(var(--lqip-cf) / 3 * 100%));
--lqip-base-clr: oklab(
  calc(var(--lqip-ll) / 3 * 0.6 + 0.2)
  calc(var(--lqip-aaa) / 8 * 0.7 - 0.35)
  calc((var(--lqip-bbb) + 1) / 8 * 0.7 - 0.35)
);
}</code></pre>
<card-box> <strong>Time for another demo!</strong> <label> Try different
values of <code>–lqip</code> to decode
<input type="range" min="-999999" max="999999"> </label>
<p>

</p>
<script>
    {
      const card = document.currentScript.parentElement;
      const input = card.querySelector("input");
      const preview = card.querySelector(".lqip-unpack").parentElement;

      let currentValueStr = "-721311";
      render(Number(currentValueStr));

      input.addEventListener("input", event => {
        const lqip = Number(event.currentTarget.value);
        render(lqip);
        currentValueStr = String(lqip);
      });

      function render(lqip) {
        preview.style.setProperty("--my-lqip", lqip);
      };
    }
  </script>
You can see here how each component variable maps to the LQIP image.
E.g. the <code>cb</code> value corresponds to the relative brightness of
the top middle area. <em>Fun fact: The above preview content is
implemented in pure CSS!</em> </card-box>
<h2>
Rendering it all
</h2>
<p>
Finally, rendering the LQIP. I used multiple <strong>radial
gradients</strong> to render the greyscale components, and a flat base
colour at the bottom.
</p>
<pre><code>[style*="--lqip:"] {
background-image:
  radial-gradient(50% 75% at 16.67% 25%, var(--lqip-ca-clr), transparent),
  radial-gradient(50% 75% at 50% 25%, var(--lqip-cb-clr), transparent),
  radial-gradient(50% 75% at 83.33% 25%, var(--lqip-cc-clr), transparent),
  radial-gradient(50% 75% at 16.67% 75%, var(--lqip-cd-clr), transparent),
  radial-gradient(50% 75% at 50% 75%, var(--lqip-ce-clr), transparent),
  radial-gradient(50% 75% at 83.33% 75%, var(--lqip-cf-clr), transparent),
  linear-gradient(0deg, var(--lqip-base-clr), var(--lqip-base-clr));
}</code></pre>
<p>
The above is a simplified version of the full renderer for illustrative
purposes. <small>The real one has doubled layers, smooth gradient
falloffs, and blend modes.</small>
</p>
<p>
As you might expect, the radial gradients are arranged in a 3×2 grid.
You can see it in this interactive deconstructor view!
</p>
<card-box> <strong>LQIP deconstructor!</strong> <label> Reveal the

</div>
<script>
    {
      const card = document.currentScript.parentElement;
      const [revealInput, lqipInput] = card.querySelectorAll("input");
      const preview = card.querySelector(".lqip-reveal");

      let currentValueStr = "-747540";
      render(Number(currentValueStr));

      lqipInput.addEventListener("input", event => {
        const lqip = Number(event.currentTarget.value);
        render(lqip);
        currentValueStr = String(lqip);
      });

      revealInput.addEventListener("input", event => {
        preview.style.setProperty("--reveal", event.currentTarget.value / 100);
      });

      function render(lqip) {
        preview.style.setProperty("--my-lqip", lqip);
      };
    }
  </script>
</card-box>
<p>
These radial gradients are the core of the CSS-based LQIP. The position
and radius of the gradients are an important detail that would determine
how well these can approximate real images. Besides that, another
requirement is that these individual radial gradients must be seamless
when combined together.
</p>
<p>
I implemented smooth gradient falloffs to make the final result look
seamless. It took special care to make the gradients extra smooth, so
let’s dive into it…
</p>
<h2>
Bilinear interpolation approximation with radial gradients
</h2>
<p>
Radial gradients use linear interpolation by default. Interpolation
refers to how it maps the in-between colours from the start colour to
the end colour. And linear interpolation, the most basic interpolation,
well…
</p>
<figure>
<interpolation-example></interpolation-example>
<figcaption>
CSS radial-gradients with linear interpolation
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
It doesn’t look good. It gives us these hard edges (highlighted above).
You could almost see the elliptical edges of each radial gradient and
their centers.
</p>
<p>
In real raster images, we’d use
<a href="https://harmoniccode.blogspot.com/2011/04/bilinear-color-interpolation.html" target="_blank">bilinear
interpolation</a> at the very least when scaling up low resolution
images.
<a href="https://blog.demofox.org/2015/08/15/resizing-images-with-bicubic-interpolation/" target="_blank">Bicubic
interpolation is even better.</a>
</p>
<p>
One way to simulate the smoothness of bilinear interpolation in an array
of CSS radial-gradients is to use <strong>‘quadratic easing’</strong> to
control the gradation of opacity.
</p>
<p>
This means the opacity falloff of the gradient would be smoother around
the center and the edges. Each gradient would get feathered edges,
smoothening the overall composite image.

</fixed-grid></prose-bleed>
<p>
However, CSS gradients
<a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1332" target="_blank">don’t
support nonlinear interpolation of opacity yet as of writing</a> (not to
be confused with colour space interpolation, which browsers do
support!). The solution for now is to add more points in the gradient to
get a smooth opacity curve based on the quadratic formula.
</p>
<pre><code>radial-gradient(
  &lt;position&gt;,
  rgb(82 190 240 / 100%) 0%,
  rgb(82 190 204 / 98%) 10%,
  rgb(82 190 204 / 92%) 20%,
  rgb(82 190 204 / 82%) 30%,
  rgb(82 190 204 / 68%) 40%,
  rgb(82 190 204 / 32%) 60%,
  rgb(82 190 204 / 18%) 70%,
  rgb(82 190 204 / 8%) 80%,
  rgb(82 190 204 / 2%) 90%,
  transparent 100%
)</code></pre>
<figure>
<img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/css-only-lqip/interpolation-graph.png?ref=rss" width="1024" height="768">
<figcaption>
The quadratic interpolation is based on two quadratic curves
(parabolas), one for each half of the gradient — one upward and another
downward.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
The quadratic easing blends adjacent radial gradients together,
mimicking the smooth bilinear (or even bicubic) interpolation. It’s
almost like a fake blur filter, thus achieving the ‘blur’ part of this
BlurHash alternative.

Appendix: Alternatives considered
</h2>
<h3>
Four colours instead of monochromatic preview
</h3>
<p>
Four 5-bit colours, where each <b>R</b> is 2 bits, <b>G</b> is 2 bits,
and <b>B</b> is just a zero or one.
</p>
<p>
The four colours would map to the four corners of the image box,
rendered as radial gradients
</p>
<p>
This was my first attempt, and I fiddled with this for a while, but
mixing four colours properly require proper bilinear interpolation and
probably a shader. Just layering gradients resulted in muddiness (just
like mixing too many watercolour pigments), and there was no CSS blend
mode that could fix it. So I abandoned it, and moved on to a
monochromatic approach.
</p>
<h3>
Single solid colour
</h3>
<p>
This was what I used on this website before. It’s simple and effective.
A clean-markup approach could still use the custom <code>–lqip</code>
variable:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img src="…" style="--lqip:#9bc28e"&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
/* we save some bytes by ‘aliasing’ this property */
* { background-color: var(--lqip) }
&lt;/style&gt;</code></pre>
<h3>
HTML attribute instead of CSS custom property
</h3>
<p>
We can use HTML attributes to control CSS soon! Here’s what the LQIP
markup would look like in the future:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img src="…" lqip="192900"&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Waiting for
<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/advanced-attr" target="_blank"><code>attr()</code>
Level 5</a> for this one. It’s nicer and shorter, fewer weird
punctuations in markup <small>(who came up with the double dash for CSS
vars anyway?)</small>. The value can then be referenced in CSS with
<code>attr(lqip type(&lt;number&gt;))</code> instead of
<code>var(–lqip)</code>.
</p>
<p>
For extra safety, a <code>data-</code> prefix could be added to the
attribute name.
</p>
<p>
Can’t wait for this to get widespread adoption. I also want it for my
<a href="https://jordanbrennan.hashnode.dev/tac-a-new-css-methodology" target="_blank">TAC
components</a>.
