Hurricane Henriette Discussion Number  27
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP082025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Sun Aug 10 2025

Henriette has put on quite the show today with a well-defined eye 
emerging during the past few hours along with cooling temperatures 
in the eyewall.  Dvorak intensity estimates were up to 65 kt by 
18Z, and with the further development on satellite since that time, 
the initial wind speed is set to 70 kt for this advisory. 

It remains to be seen how strong Henriette will get with an 
improving environment along its path during the next day or so, 
including decreasing shear, increasing SSTs and cooling upper-level 
temperatures.  Given that this rapid intensification period was not 
well forecast, and a recent closed 37 GHz ring on AMSR2 data, I'm 
inclined to go above the guidance in this situation and show near 
rapid intensification for about 24 h until the environment becomes 
more hostile.  Henriette should lose all deep convection in about 3 
days over cold waters and in very high shear.
 
The storm is moving northwestward at about 15 kt.  A large ridge
over the north-central Pacific should cause a continued fast
northwestward track of Henriette for several days until its slows 
down a bit near dissipation.  The only minor change to the previous 
forecast is a faster forward speed, probably a function of the 
hurricane feeling stronger upper-level southeasterly flow during 
the next couple of days.

Tropical Storm Ivo Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
200 PM PDT Sun Aug 10 2025
 
Even over waters of 23-24 degrees Celsius, Ivo is managing to 
maintain a persistent area of deep convection.  A recent ASCAT pass 
showed maximum winds of 30 kt.  Accounting for the instrument's 
sampling limitations, and combined with satellite estimates still 
running around 35 kt, it is estimated that Ivo is hanging on to 
tropical storm status.  Sea surface temperatures drop by another 2-3 
degrees along Ivo's forecast track, so weakening is expected to 
resume tonight, and simulated satellite images from the GFS and 
ECMWF show that deep convection could finally be gone by Monday 
morning.  Degeneration into a remnant low is forecast by 24 hours, 
followed by dissipation into a trough in 60 hours.
 
Ivo is moving west-northwestward (285 deg) at 10 kt.  This motion 
should continue for the next 12 hours, followed by a slight bend to 
the west in 24 hours as Ivo stays situated to the south of the low- 
to mid-level ridge.  The track models are tightly clustered, and 
the new NHC forecast is mainly an update of the previous 
prediction.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0256 PM CDT Sun Aug 10 2025

Valid 102000Z - 111200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PORTIONS OF
THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible across parts of the
central/southern Plains through tonight, with large hail and
damaging winds the main threats.

...20z Update Front Range...
Initial thunderstorms should continue to develop over the higher
terrain of eastern CO and the Front Range as a broad upper trough
shifts eastward and low-level upslope flow continues this afternoon.
1500 J/kg of MLCAPE and westerly flow aloft around 35-45 kt will
support supercells. Steep mid-level lapse rates and cooler mid-level
temperatures will favor an initial risk for hail before upscale
growth results in an MCS tonight. Damaging gusts are possible into
parts of the southern Plains. Have expanded the Slight Risk farther
north/east where development is possible closer to the WY/CO border.


...Mid Mississippi Valley...
Diurnal heating ahead of the weak cold front over the Midwest will
continue to support moderate destabilization this afternoon. Ongoing
thunderstorm clusters should gradually expand eastward as cold pools
deepen. While vertical shear will not be strong, (generally less
than 20 kt) an occasional damaging gust remains possible over parts
of IL, MO and WI. Have expanded the Marginal risk eastward to cover
the low-end risk. Otherwise, see the prior outlook for additional
info.

..Lyons.. 08/10/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1121 AM CDT Sun Aug 10 2025/

...CO/KS...
Morning water vapor loop shows a vigorous shortwave trough digging
southeastward into central CO.  Large scale forcing for ascent ahead
of this trough will aid in the development of scattered
thunderstorms along the foothills of central CO by early afternoon,
with storms spreading eastward through the afternoon/evening.  Ample
low-level moisture and CAPE are present over eastern CO/western KS
to promote a few intense cells, with favorable westerly flow aloft
for supercell structures. Large hail is the main concern, with an
increasing risk of damaging winds with eastward extent this evening.
 A tornado or two is possible as storms interact with a remnant
outflow boundary that extends across the TX Panhandle and northwest
OK.

...MO/IL/WI...
A corridor of strong heating will encourage scattered thunderstorm
development this afternoon from southern MO into central/northeast
IL.  Weak winds aloft and considerable mid-level moisture will limit
overall downdraft potential.  Nevertheless, gusty/damaging winds
could occur with the strongest cells.

...Southeast AZ...
Similar to yesterday, scattered high-based afternoon/evening
thunderstorm development is expected over southeast AZ in a
hot/unstable environment.  The strongest cells may produce locally
damaging wind gusts.

..Thornton.. 08/10/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0134 AM CDT Sun Aug 10 2025/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected to abate on Monday across the
Four Corners region, though some threat for isolated dry
thunderstorms will continue for parts of central AZ to far western
NM. A shortwave trough evident in water-vapor imagery over WY/UT is
forecast to weaken and stall over the southern High Plains by late
Monday. This will favor subtle surface pressure rises across the
eastern Great Basin/Four Corners region with relatively weaker
low-level winds. Although sustained winds will be modest, deep
mixing will promote occasional gusts upwards of 15-25 mph across
northern AZ to northwest NM where RH values should fall into the low
teens. Transient elevated conditions are possible, but poor
deterministic agreement and/or ensemble consensus precluded
introducing risk highlights. However, weak orographic ascent along
the Mogollon Rim within a deeply-mixed, but weakly buoyant, air mass
will support some potential for isolated dry thunderstorms. Given
recent dry lightning over the region within a similar thermodynamic
environment, isolated dry thunderstorm highlights were maintained
and focused along and north of the more prominent terrain features.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0227 PM CDT Sun Aug 10 2025

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong thunderstorms may impact parts of the upper Great
Lakes region Tuesday.  While the risk for severe weather still
appears low, locally strong gusts and hail might still be possible.

...Discussion...
An initially prominent mid-level high centered offshore of the
Pacific Northwest is forecast to become suppressed
west-southwestward across the northern mid-latitude eastern Pacific
during this period, as a consolidating short wave trough digs near
the Canadian Rockies.  As downstream flow trends more zonal, it
appears that a pair of short wave perturbations will consolidate
into a larger-scale short wave trough across northern Ontario into
Quebec by late Tuesday night.  This evolution may include a lead
perturbation continuing to dig across parts of the upper Midwest and
adjacent Great Lakes region, before pivoting east/northeast of the
Lake Huron/Georgian Bay vicinity, in advance of a trailing impulse
digging south of Hudson Bay.  More uncertain, due to greater model
spread, the lead short wave may be preceded across the Lower
Michigan vicinity by an increasingly sheared, convectively generated
perturbation emerging from the central Great Plains.

The evolution of this regime is forecast to include an initial
intrusion of somewhat cooler/drier air, which may maintain identity
while advancing across the Great Lakes region, Midwest and lower
Missouri Valley, before being overtaken by a more substantive
reinforcing cool intrusion across the Great Lakes by late Tuesday
night.  Both fronts will be preceded by the increasingly diffuse
remnants of a slow moving or stalled surface frontal zone extending
from the lower Great Lakes into the southern Great Plains, and
boundary layer moistening/destabilization ahead of the lead front
advancing across Upper Michigan and Wisconsin by late Tuesday
afternoon remains a bit unclear. 

Barring complications from lingering convective cloud
cover/precipitation associated with the possible MCV emerging from
the Great Plains, it might not be out of the question that the
environment in a corridor along/ahead of the front could become
supportive of organized thunderstorms with potential to produce
strong wind gusts and hail.  Depending on the strength of the MCV,
which remains unclear due to model spread, wind fields may
strengthen sufficiently to support at least some risk for organized
strong/severe thunderstorm development across Lower Michigan, where
stronger pre-frontal destabilization appears most probable.

If/when these uncertainties become better resolved, it is possible
that severe probabilities in excess of 5 percent, or higher, will be
needed across parts of the Great Lakes region in later outlooks for
this period.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1218 PM CDT Sun Aug 10 2025

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS LATE MONDAY
AFTERNOON AND EVENING ACROSS  PARTS OF EASTERN NORTH
DAKOTA...NORTHWESTERN MINNESOTA...EAST CENTRAL NEW MEXICO AND
NORTHWESTERN TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Strong thunderstorms accompanied by at least some risk for severe
wind and hail may impact parts of eastern New Mexico into the Texas
South Plains, as well as  parts of eastern North Dakota into
northwestern Minnesota, late Monday afternoon and evening.

...Discussion...
While the westerlies generally remain confined to the higher
latitudes, one significant embedded short wave trough is forecast to
continue digging southeast of the Canadian Prairies through the
international border vicinity, to the west of the Great Lakes,
during this period.  It appears that this will be accompanied by one
initial surge of cooler/drier boundary layer air across much of the
Dakotas and portions of the Upper Midwest/adjacent Great Lakes
region by late Monday night.

Otherwise, weak mid-level troughing likely will linger across much
of the remainder of the interior U.S., to the east of the Rockies,
between large-scale mean ridging centered offshore of both the
Pacific and Atlantic coasts.  An associated weak surface frontal
zone, still reinforced by convective outflow in some locations, is
likely to linger across the Great Lakes through lower Missouri
Valley and Texas South Plains into early Monday, before generally
continuing to weaken through the period.  

Seasonably high boundary-layer moisture content probably will be
maintained ahead of the stalled/slow moving remnant front, across
much of the Southwest, as well as in a corridor along and to the
north it.  Some of this moisture across the lower/middle Missouri
Valley may begin to advect northward ahead of the lead reinforcing
cool intrusion late Monday into Monday night.

...Southern Great Plains into Great Lakes...
The seasonably high boundary-layer moisture content, along/just
north of the weakening front, may provide support for the
development of moderate to locally higher CAPE with insolation
Monday.  As this occurs, it appears that a number of convectively
generated or augmented perturbations within the generally weak
southwesterly deep-layer mean flow could contribute to scattered
thunderstorm development during and after peak heating. Some of this
could pose a risk for localized potentially damaging wind gusts, but
the coverage of any such activity still seems likely to remain
rather sparse in nature.

One possible exception may develop along a modifying segment of the
boundary across parts of east central New Mexico into the Texas
South Plains by late Monday afternoon or evening, beneath steeper
mid-level lapse rates associated with the remnants of a plume of
warm elevated mixed-layer air.  There appears a general consensus
within the various model output that a digging short wave impulse,
within a weak northwesterly mid-level regime, may provide support
for a relatively notable upscale growing/southeastward propagating
thunderstorm cluster.

Farther northeast, the NAM, perhaps more so than other model output,
suggests that a notable MCV may emerge from Sunday night convection
over the central Great Plains, before slowly migrating across the
lower Missouri Valley toward the Great Lakes Monday through Monday
night.  It is possible that a perturbation of the strength suggested
by the NAM could, at some point, support another notable evolving
cluster with potential to produce strong wind gusts.  At this point,
however, the potential for this still seems low, with too much
uncertainty to introduce 5 percent probabilities without unduly
large false alarm area.

...Northern Great Plains...
A moistening boundary-layer, aided by evapotranspiration and perhaps
the onset of better low-level moisture return on strengthening
southerly low-level flow, may contribute to moderate CAPE within a
corridor of stronger pre-frontal surface heating by late afternoon. 
Coupled with strengthening deep-layer mean wind fields and shear,
downstream of a digging 50+ kt 500 mb jet, it appears that the
environment may become conducive to vigorous convective development
capable of producing small to marginally severe hail and strong
surface gusts.  Potential for gusts approaching or exceeding severe
limits appears highest during the late afternoon and early evening
across parts of eastern North Dakota into northwestern Minnesota,
where warm, unsaturated low-level thermodynamic profiles with steep
lapse rates will aid downward momentum transfer via enhanced melting
and evaporative cooling in downdrafts.

..Thornton.. 08/10/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0103 AM CDT Sun Aug 10 2025/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will continue for today across parts of the
Four Corners/Southwest region. Early-morning water-vapor imagery
depicts a pronounced mid-level perturbation traversing UT/WY as of
06 UTC. This feature is expected to reach AZ/NM by peak heating this
afternoon, which will induce west/northwesterly mid-level flow
across the greater Four Corners region. Although low-level pressure
gradient winds will likely remain somewhat modest (generally around
15 mph), deep mixing will promote downward mixing of 20-30 mph gusts
across far southern UT into northern AZ and northwest NM. Dry
conditions will persist and support another day of RH minimums in
the single digits and elevated fire weather conditions. More
aggressive solutions, such as the HRRR and RAP that have a tendency
to over-mix, hint that elevated conditions may extend as far north
as eastern UT/western CO, but general ensemble consensus is meager.
Therefore opted to maintain highlights mainly over AZ/NM where
confidence in sustained elevated conditions is higher. 

In addition to supporting elevated fire weather conditions, the
mid-level perturbation will also promote isolated to scattered
thunderstorm development across the greater Southwest and southern
High Plains region. Convection developing along the Mogollon Rim
will likely develop on the fringe of the deeper monsoonal moisture
where PWATs should remain near 0.75 inches and LCLs will likely
reach 3-4 km. These thermodynamic conditions were observed yesterday
afternoon/evening (e.g. the 00z ABQ sounding) across the region and
yielded isolated dry lightning strikes. As such, a similar risk for
dry lightning should manifest this afternoon.

Valid 101630Z - 111200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND
TONIGHT OVER PORTIONS OF THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible across parts of the
central/southern Plains today and tonight, with large hail and
damaging winds the main threats.

...CO/KS...
Morning water vapor loop shows a vigorous shortwave trough digging
southeastward into central CO.  Large scale forcing for ascent ahead
of this trough will aid in the development of scattered
thunderstorms along the foothills of central CO by early afternoon,
with storms spreading eastward through the afternoon/evening.  Ample
low-level moisture and CAPE are present over eastern CO/western KS
to promote a few intense cells, with favorable westerly flow aloft
for supercell structures. Large hail is the main concern, with an
increasing risk of damaging winds with eastward extent this evening.
 A tornado or two is possible as storms interact with a remnant
outflow boundary that extends across the TX Panhandle and northwest
OK.

...MO/IL/WI...
A corridor of strong heating will encourage scattered thunderstorm
development this afternoon from southern MO into central/northeast
IL.  Weak winds aloft and considerable mid-level moisture will limit
overall downdraft potential.  Nevertheless, gusty/damaging winds
could occur with the strongest cells.

...Southeast AZ...
Similar to yesterday, scattered high-based afternoon/evening
thunderstorm development is expected over southeast AZ in a
hot/unstable environment.  The strongest cells may produce locally
damaging wind gusts.

Valid 101300Z - 111200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE CENTRAL/SOUTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible across parts of the
central/southern Plains today and tonight, with large hail and
damaging winds the main threats. Strong to severe thunderstorms may
also occur from parts of the Midwest to the upper Great Lakes.

...Eastern Kansas/Missouri/Iowa to the Upper Great Lakes...
Loosely organized convection is ongoing this morning across parts of
eastern IA, aided by modest low-level warm advection and a MCV.
While this activity has generally remained sub-severe for the past
few hours, there is some potential for gradual re-intensification
through the afternoon as the MCV tracks northeastward across parts
of the Upper Midwest. While cloud cover is noted downstream per
early-morning visible satellite imagery, filtered daytime heating
should encourage the development of weak to locally moderate
instability by early to mid afternoon over portions of WI and
vicinity ahead of a weak front. It remains unclear whether a bowing
cluster will be able to form later today, but isolated damaging
winds may occur if it develops and can persist.

Farther south across eastern KS into MO, ongoing thunderstorms are
occurring generally to the north of a convectively reinforced
outflow boundary/front. While this elevated activity could pose an
isolated hail/wind threat this morning, it is generally forecast to
diminish by late morning as a southwesterly low-level jet gradually
weakens. However, additional thunderstorm development may occur this
afternoon/evening along and south of the outflow boundary in MO as
daytime heating of a rather moist low-level airmass supports
moderate to strong instability. Deep-layer shear will remain weak
across this area, but occasional severe/damaging gusts could still
occur given the large degree of buoyancy forecast.

...Central/Southern Plains...
Extensive convective overturning yesterday/early this morning should
result in a less unstable post-frontal airmass across the
central/southern High Plains compared to Saturday. Even so, steep
mid-level lapse rates emanating from the Southwest should once again
overspread a modestly moist low-level airmass this afternoon. This
will foster the development of weak to moderate instability in
tandem with daytime heating. Thunderstorms will likely develop over
the higher terrain/CO Front Range by early afternoon as a weak
mid-level shortwave trough presently over eastern UT/western CO
moves eastward. Sufficient deep-layer shear for organized updrafts
is forecast, including the potential for a few supercells with
associated threat for mainly large hail, and perhaps a tornado.

With time, clustering should occur over the central/southern High
Plains along and perhaps a bit north of the convectively reinforced
front/outflow boundary. Ample MUCAPE, steepened lapse rates aloft,
and a modest southerly low-level jet should support some threat for
severe gusts with one or more clusters that may spread eastward this
evening and overnight. Have expanded the Slight Risk eastward across
parts of western/central KS, the adjacent OK/TX Panhandles, and
northwest OK based on a consensus of recent model guidance showing
this potential.

Tropical Storm Ivo Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
200 AM MST Sun Aug 10 2025

Ivo is weakening while it passes over the cooler waters well to the 
west of Baja California Sur, and its associated deep convection 
is gradually decreasing in coverage and intensity.  Data from an 
excellent scatterometer overpass just before 0500 UTC showed that 
the maximum winds have decreased to near 35 kt.  Subjective Dvorak 
analyses from TAFB and SAB, along with objective Dvorak values from 
UW-CIMSS gave a similar intensity estimate, indicating that Ivo is 
now at minimal tropical storm strength.

Center fixes indicate that the cyclone continues to move 
west-northwestward, or at about 285/7 kt.  A low- to mid-level 
ridge is predicted to remain to the north of Ivo during the next 
couple of days.  The system is likely to turn more westward with a 
slight increase in forward speed in a day or so as the increasingly 
shallow circulation becomes steered by the low-level easterlies.  
The official forecast track is very similar to the one from the 
previous advisory.

Ivo is moving over cooler waters with gradually decreasing 
environmental moisture.  Therefore weakening should continue, and 
the system will likely degenerate into a post-tropical remnant low 
in 24 hours or so.  The intensity forecast is similar to the 
previous NHC forecast and near the high end of the model guidance.

Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number  25
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP082025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Sat Aug 09 2025
 
Satellite imagery shows that Henriette retains a well-organized 
low-level structure, with a curved band wrapping around the west 
side of the circulation. However, convection within the band has 
struggled to persist due to surrounding dry mid- to upper-level air. 
Subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates from SAB, JTWC, and 
HFO, along with objective estimates from UW-CIMSS, support holding 
the initial intensity at 35 kt for this advisory.

The initial motion is toward the northwest at 13 kt, steered by a 
subtropical ridge to the northeast and an amplifying mid-latitude 
trough to the northwest. Henriette’s forward speed is expected to 
increase through 36 hours, level off near 60 hours, and then slow 
through 96 hours as the steering flow weakens. This motion will keep 
Henriette well northeast of the Hawaiian Islands. Guidance indicates 
the sharp upper trough will cut off into an upper low on Monday and 
retrograde westward, a pattern that should maintain Henriette’s 
northwestward motion. The track forecast is very similar to the 
previous one but is slightly left of the earlier forecast from days 
3 to 4, and lies near the middle of the tightly clustered consensus 
aids.

Sea-surface temperatures along Henriette’s forecast track should 
gradually warm from near 25 degrees C to around 26–27 degrees C 
through about 60 h. Despite surrounding dry mid- to upper-level air, 
a combination of warmer waters and increasing upper-level divergence 
associated with an upper trough to the northwest should enhance 
outflow and support gradual strengthening. The NHC forecast 
continues to show a peak near 55 kt in the 36–48 h period, nearly 
identical to the previous forecast and within the middle to upper 
end of the guidance envelope. Thereafter, cooler waters, increasing 
shear, and diminishing upper-level outflow should result in steady 
weakening, with Henriette expected to become a post-tropical remnant 
low by 96 h and dissipate by 120 h as it is absorbed into the 
mid-latitude flow.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0324 AM CDT Sun Aug 10 2025

Valid 131200Z - 181200Z

...DISCUSSION...
From Wednesday/D4 into Thursday/D5, a shortwave trough is forecast
to move from the Pacific Northwest across MT and over the far
northern Plains, with an upper speed max developing into southern SK
and MB. In advance of this trough, a leading trough affecting the
Great Lakes region will also lift northeastward, with height rises
and a warming pattern across parts of the Plains and upper Midwest.
The combination of increasing dewpoints and the upper trough
glancing the region may result in some manner of severe risk late
Thursday/D5, and most likely from parts of ND into northern MN, and
in evening/overnight MCS form. Future model trends will be monitored
for a possible risk area.

From Friday/D6 onward, predictability decreases with the motion of
the aforementioned upper wave. However, large instability is likely
to again build across the Mid MO/Upper MS Valleys, and at least
sporadic severe storms cannot be ruled out from the northern High
Plains eastward toward the Upper Great Lakes.

Mesoscale Discussion 1914
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0254 PM CDT Sat Aug 09 2025

Areas affected...portions of far northeast Missouri into far
southeastern Iowa and central into northern Illinois

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 091954Z - 092130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A few damaging gusts may occur with the stronger storms
that manage to mature and sustain themselves.

DISCUSSION...Multiple thunderstorms are developing along the eastern
fringes of a primary confluence band and ahead of a surface cold
front, where ample heating is underway. Surface temperatures are
approaching 90 F in many places, and given low 70s F dewpoints,
MLCAPE is exceeding 3000 J/kg on a widespread basis. Deep-layer
forcing and shear are lagging well to the west of the free warm
sector, prompting great uncertainty in the overall coverage and
intensity of storms into question. Still, ample buoyancy in place
will promote wet downburst and damaging gust potential with any
storms that can become organized. Therefore, convective trends will
continue to be monitored for the need of a Severe Thunderstorm
Watch, should storms become more abundant and organized.

Mesoscale Discussion 1913
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0153 PM CDT Sat Aug 09 2025

Areas affected...Eastern Colorado...Western Kansas...and far
southwest Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 091853Z - 092130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Multiple rounds of severe thunderstorms will be possible
across portions of the area this afternoon into the overnight. Large
hail and damaging winds are the most likely hazards, but tornadoes
cannot be ruled out. A watch is likely later this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Southeasterly low-level flow has maintained dewpoints
from the mid-50Fs to low 60Fs this afternoon across southeast
Colorado, in the presence of strong diurnal mixing. The result is
most-unstable CAPE values in excess of 2500 J/kg across portions of
the area. At the same time, modest westerly 500mb flow a top this
southeasterly low-level flow has maintained deep-layer shear values
between 30 and 45 knots. This has set the stage for one or more
rounds of thunderstorms this afternoon into the overnight.

Expectations are for thunderstorms to initiate within the next
couple of hours in the vicinity of the Palmer Divide. There are a
couple of different areas where initiation might occur first --
within the Denver cyclone or along the Palmer Divide itself where
continued upslope flow is sufficient to overcome convective
inhibition. Additional areas of convective initiation could occur
across portions of the Nebraska panhandle where convergence is
increasing along a residual low-level boundary.

The overall wind field will be supportive of discrete convective
modes, including supercells, capable of all hazards, although high
LCLs may limit the tornado potential somewhat. 

Additional thunderstorms will be possible later this evening into
the overnight across the higher terrain west of the initial
convection as moist outflow boundaries move west into the mountains
and large-scale ascent increases in response to an approaching
short-wave trough. The main threat with these storms would be large
hail and damaging winds.

Given the possibility for multiple rounds of severe thunderstorms
anticipated, one or more watches will likely be needed later today.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 581
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
155 PM MDT Sat Aug 9 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northeast Colorado
  Northwest Kansas
  Southwest Nebraska

* Effective this Saturday afternoon and evening from 155 PM until
  900 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 3 inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will increase in coverage and intensity
through the afternoon in a moist and very unstable environment.  A
few supercells capable of very large hail and eventually damaging
winds are expected across the watch area.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 50
statute miles east and west of a line from 40 miles south of Limon
CO to 65 miles north of Imperial NE. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
3 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
27030.

Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number  23
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP082025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Sat Aug 09 2025
 
Deep convection has evolved a bit since the previous advisory with
a curved band wrapping around the west side of Henriette.  The
latest subjective Dvorak classifications range from 25-30 kt, and
the objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS have been ranging
between 35-37 kt.  Based mainly on the objective estimates, it is
estimated that Henriette has regained tropical storm strength with
maximum winds estimated at 35 kt.
 
Henriette is moving a little faster now in a direction between
west-northwest and northwest, at 14 kt.  Henriette will round the
southwestern periphery of the subtropical ridge tonight as a
deep-layer mid-latitude trough approaches from the west.  In a
couple of days, the trough will become stationary or even retrograde
westward.  This steering pattern favors a continued northwestward
motion through the forecast period.  The new NHC track forecast is a
little faster than the previous one, but along a similar track line,
and is in agreement with the consensus aids.
 
Henriette will move over gradually warming sea-surface temperatures
(SSTs) and through gradually cooling upper-level temperatures now
through the next 60 h or so.  SSTs currently near 25C are forecast
to warm to the 26.5 to 27C range along the cyclone's path.  The 
cyclone is also currently embedded in very dry mid-tropospheric 
air, and these dry conditions are expected to persist for the next 
couple of days.  Given the competing factors mentioned above, slow 
strengthening seems likely over the next couple of days.  The 
latest NHC intensity forecast is similar to the previous one and is 
near the middle of the guidance envelope.  Beyond day 3, wind shear 
should increase, and Henriette will also reach cooler water again 
as it gains latitude.  These factors should cause the system to 
lose its convection and become post-tropical by day 4, with 
dissipation in about 5 days.

Tropical Storm Ivo Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
200 PM MST Sat Aug 09 2025
 
Moderate northeasterly shear is displacing most of Ivo's convection 
south of the center, and the convective mass itself has begun to 
shrink.  The initial intensity is lowered to 45 kt based on a T3.0 
classification from TAFB, and this is also supported by a recent 
ASCAT pass which showed a maximum of 38 kt (but is likely limited 
by the instrument's resolution).  Continued moderate shear, 
gradually cooling sea surface temperatures, and a stable air mass 
ahead of Ivo are forecast to continue the weakening trend.  GFS- 
and ECMWF-based simulated satellite imagery show all deep convection 
dissipating by 36 hours, which is when Ivo is shown degenerating 
into a remnant low in the official forecast.  Dissipation is now 
expected by day 3, which is when the remnant low loses its 
integrity in the global model fields.

Ivo has been moving westward, or 280/6 kt.  Low- to mid-level 
ridging is expected to keep Ivo on a westward or west-northwestward 
track through dissipation.  There is low spread among the track 
models, and only minor adjustments were made to the new NHC 
forecast.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ivo was
located near latitude 21.0 North, longitude 113.5 West.  Ivo is
moving toward the west near 7 mph (11 km/h).  A westward to 
west-northwestward motion at a slightly faster forward speed is 
expected during the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional weakening is forecast, and Ivo is 
expected to degenerate into a remnant low by late Sunday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1003 mb (29.62 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Ivo will continue to affect the southern
portion of the Baja California peninsula during the next day or so.
These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local weather
office.

Mesoscale Discussion 1911
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0729 AM CDT Sat Aug 09 2025

Areas affected...portions of IA into southeast MN and far
west-central WI

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 580...

Valid 091229Z - 091430Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 580
continues.

SUMMARY...Severe thunderstorms producing damaging wind gusts will
persist across portions of western into north-central Iowa this
morning.

DISCUSSION...Severe gusts continue with the cluster of storms
ongoing across west-central IA this morning. Radar trends have shown
some downward trend in velocity strength as well as a somewhat more
disorganized presentation in reflectivity. Nevertheless, measured
severe gusts and wind damage reports continue as convection develops
northeast along/just ahead of a surface cold front. 

The downstream airmass remains strongly unstable, and convection
will persist along the length of the surface front from west-central
WI into southeast MN and northern/western IA. The core of the
low-level jet remains centered just east of ongoing storms, and
stronger vertical shear tends to lag behind the surface boundary.
Convection along the front in MN/WI has largely been unproductive
overnight. While strong to severe gusts remain possible in the short
term across IA, it is unclear if severe potential and a downstream
watch will be needed into MN/WI.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds likely with isolated significant gusts
    to 80 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A small but intense bowing cluster should continue moving
east-northeastward this morning while producing scattered to
numerous severe/damaging winds. Isolated gusts up to 70-80 mph
appear possible. Additional thunderstorms will also develop along a
cold front across parts of western into central Iowa. This activity
should also pose mainly a severe/damaging wind threat, but isolated
hail may also occur.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 50
statute miles east and west of a line from 35 miles northwest of
Mason City IA to 35 miles southwest of Des Moines IA. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU0).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 579...

Tropical Storm Ivo Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
200 AM MST Sat Aug 09 2025
 
Ivo is having intermittent bursts of deep convection since the last 
advisory.  An ASCAT pass from 0412 UTC showed the center of the 
small circulation near the northeastern edge of the CDO.  Subjective 
and objective satellite intensity estimates have generally decreased 
in recent hours and the initial intensity is lowered to 50 kt for 
this cycle.  

The storm is moving westward at 8 kt.  A general westward to 
west-northwestward motion is anticipated through the forecast period 
while Ivo is steered along the southern side of a ridge positioned 
to its north.  The track guidance has shifted poleward this cycle, 
and the latest official forecast lies on the southern side of the 
envelope between the ECMWF to its south and the simple consensus aid 
TVCE to its north.

Ivo is currently crossing a cooling gradient of sea surface 
temperatures and moving towards a dry and stable airmass.  The storm 
is expected to gradually weaken through the weekend, until it 
becomes a post-tropical cyclone sometime Sunday night or Monday 
morning.  The NHC intensity forecast has been adjusted lower based 
on the decrease in initial intensity and is in the middle of the 
guidance envelope.

Tropical Depression Henriette Discussion Number  21
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP082025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Fri Aug 08 2025
 
Deep convection that developed north of Henriette’s well-defined 
low-level circulation earlier today has persisted during the past 
several hours. Given this sustained convective activity and the 
presence of a closed surface circulation, Henriette is being 
reclassified as a tropical depression. A Metop-B ASCAT pass at 0655 
UTC indicated peak winds up to 30 kt in the northern semicircle, 
supporting the initial intensity estimate of 30 kt.

The initial motion is toward the west-northwest at about 13 kt, 
steered by a low- to mid-level ridge to its north. This general 
motion is expected to continue through the next 24 hours. From 24 to 
72 hours, the cyclone should gradually turn toward the northwest as 
it approaches a weakness in the ridge caused by an amplifying 
upper-level trough well northwest of Hawaii. Between 72 and 96 
hours, Henriette is forecast to turn toward the north-northwest as 
the trough becomes the primary steering feature. The updated track 
forecast remains very similar to the previous advisory and is near 
the middle of the tightly clustered consensus aids.

The system is currently located over sea surface temperatures near 
24 degrees C and within a stable, dry mid- to upper-level 
environment, which should limit convective coverage in the near 
term. However, global model guidance indicates that the cyclone will 
traverse an area of slightly warmer water between 24 and 72 hours. 
At the same time, upper-level divergence is forecast to increase in 
association with the approaching trough, which should enhance 
instability and support gradual strengthening beginning late 
Saturday and continuing into early next week. After that time, 
upper-level divergence is forecast to diminish, vertical shear will 
increase, and water temperatures will cool sharply. This loss of 
outflow support and more hostile environment should result in steady 
weakening, with Henriette expected to become a post-tropical remnant 
low by 120 h and dissipate soon thereafter as it is absorbed by a 
larger mid-latitude system. The new intensity forecast is nearly 
unchanged from the previous NHC forecast and lies near the middle- 
to upper-end of the guidance envelope.

Tropical Storm Ivo Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
200 PM MST Fri Aug 08 2025
 
Ivo's structure has become more organized during the past few 
hours, with inner core banding becoming more pronounced.  Recent 
WSF-M and GMI microwave data were helpful in confirming the 
improved structure, and also showed that Ivo's center was located a 
little farther south than previously estimated.  Despite the 
improved structure, there is a wide range in intensity estimates.  
Subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB range from 55-65 kt, 
while objective numbers from UW-CIMSS are stuck at 40-45 kt.  To 
add to the quandary, ASCAT data only showed maximum winds of 35 kt, 
but it is highly likely that Ivo is too small for the instrument to 
effectively sample its maximum winds.  For now, Ivo's maximum winds 
are set to 55 kt.

The storm has turned westward and continues to slow down with an 
initial motion of 275/11 kt.  A westward to west-northwestward 
trajectory is forecast to continue for the next several days as 
strong mid-level ridging remains entrenched to the north.  The NHC 
track forecast has been shifted south of the previous prediction to 
account for the adjustment of the initial position, but otherwise 
it is very close to the various multi-model consensus aids.

Some additional strengthening is anticipated during the next 12-24 
hours while Ivo remains in an unstable environment with upper-level 
divergence, and over waters warmer than 26 degrees Celsius.  
While not explicitly shown in the forecast, Ivo could still 
become a hurricane between the nominal forecast times.  All of 
the aforementioned environmental factors turn detrimental in about 
36 hours, at which point more significant weakening is expected to 
begin.  Ivo could lose its deep convection and become post-tropical 
in about 60 hours.  Dissipation is now shown by day 4 in line with 
the ECWMF, UKMET, and Canadian model solutions, with the GFS being 
an outlier and continuing the remnant low westward for another day 
or so after that.

BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Ivo Advisory Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
200 PM MST Fri Aug 08 2025
 
...IVO STRENGTHENS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 PM MST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...20.4N 111.2W
ABOUT 190 MI...310 KM SSW OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...65 MPH...100 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...W OR 275 DEGREES AT 13 MPH...20 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...999 MB...29.50 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
None.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ivo was
located near latitude 20.4 North, longitude 111.2 West.  Ivo is
moving toward the west near 13 mph (20 km/h).  A westward to 
west-northwestward motion at a slower forward speed is expected 
during the next several days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 65 mph (100 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Additional strengthening is possible through 
Saturday, but weakening is expected to begin by Sunday.  Ivo is 
forecast to become post-tropical by Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 999 mb (29.50 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Ivo will continue to affect the
southwestern coast of Mexico and the southern portion of the
Baja California peninsula during the next day or so.  These swells
are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current
conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Post-Tropical Cyclone Henriette Discussion Number  19
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   EP082025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Fri Aug 08 2025

Approximately 18 hours have passed since Henriette last produced any
significant areas of deep convection, and the cyclone has now been
downgraded to a post-tropical remnant low.  The current motion is
now west-northwestward, or 285/15 kt.  There are no changes to the
track forecast philosophy.  Henriette will move west-northwestward
along the southwestern periphery of a subtropical ridge to its
northeast.  A turn toward the northwest is forecast late this
weekend into early next week as Henriette becomes steered between an
amplifying longwave trough northwest of Hawaii and the subtropical
ridge to its northeast.  No significant changes were made to the NHC
track forecast, which is near the middle of the guidance envelope.
Confidence remains high that Henriette will remain far to the north
of Hawaii.
 
The cyclone is currently over 24C sea-surface temperatures (SSTs)
and located within a very dry environment.  Over the next couple of
days, Henriette will enter an area of gradually increasing SSTs.  At
the same time, an approaching longwave trough will bring colder
temperatures aloft near Henriette, which will increase the
instability.  The majority of the model guidance indicates this will
be enough to reignite convection and cause Henriette to restrengthen
to a tropical storm.  The peak intensity forecast in about 72 hours
has been lowered slightly from the previous NHC forecast, and now
lies between the middle and upper end of the guidance.  Beyond day
4, wind shear from the longwave trough and cooling SSTs should lead
to steady weakening as Henriette moves farther into the
mid-latitudes.
 
Given the high likelihood of regeneration back into a tropical
cyclone and subsequent restrengthening, NHC will be maintaining
advisories during the post-tropical phase.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0327 PM CDT Fri Aug 08 2025

Valid 101200Z - 161200Z

An upper-level ridge over the Southwest will shift westward and
build across much of the West by D4/Monday. An upper-level trough
will eject across the Pacific Northwest D5/Tuesday into
D6/Wednesday, bringing an increase to winds amid dry conditions.
Monsoonal moisture may return northward across portions of Arizona
late in the extended, with possible expansion of dry thunderstorm
chances.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Residual moisture beneath the ridge should allow for a continuation
of afternoon thunderstorm potential on D3/Sunday for portions of the
Southwest amid low environmental PWAT values and receptive fuels.
10% probabilities have been maintained for the region through
Sunday. 

Thunderstorm potential may extend into early next week, with a
gradual increase in moisture northward. Limited predictability
within the weak-flow regime beyond D3/Sunday precludes introducing
any additional highlights.

...Wind/RH...
Elevated to critical conditions may arise next week
(D5/Tuesday-D7/Thursday) for portions of the Pacific Northwest and
northern Great Basin, as a trough moves inland and enhanced westerly
flow overspreads the region. However, considerable spread exists
among medium-range guidance regarding the timing/placement/magnitude
of this trough, precluding the introduction of any highlights at
this time.

Tropical Storm Ivo Discussion Number   7...Corrected
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
200 AM MST Fri Aug 08 2025

Corrected T-number in the first paragraph

Ivo seems to be responding to the conducive environmental 
conditions.  Convection has been building within the core of the 
storm and geostationary satellite imagery has depicted a growing 
CDO overnight.  The small storm has managed to elude recent 
scatterometer and microwave overpasses and no new information has 
been collected with respect to the low-level structure. The initial 
intensity is held at 50 kt for this cycle based on persistence, 
which is slightly above the latest TAFB Dvorak estimate of T3.0/45 
kt.
 
Ivo is moving quickly along the southern periphery of a mid-level 
ridge at 295/18 kt.  The ridge is expected to continue turning the 
storm toward the west during the next couple of days with a 
significant decrease in forward motion.  Ivo is forecast to stay 
well south of the Baja California peninsula.  The latest official 
track forecast lies slightly to the south of the previous prediction 
beyond the 24 h forecast time.

Atmospheric and oceanic conditions are conducive for strengthening 
during the next day or so.  The NHC intensity forecast still brings 
Ivo up to hurricane strength within a day, however this peak lies 
above all the latest model guidance.  It should be noted that this 
portion of the forecast has higher-than-average uncertainty due to 
the high spread in the model guidance.  Beyond 24 hours, the model 
and official forecasts come into better agreement when Ivo moves 
over cooling sea surface temperatures and into a dry and stable 
environment with moderate vertical wind shear.  The system is still 
expected to become a remnant low within a few day and open into a 
trough by the end of the forecast period.

Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082025
1100 PM HST Thu Aug 07 2025
 
Henriette’s satellite presentation remains unimpressive this 
evening, having lost nearly all deep convection and with the 
low-level center fully exposed.  The latest subjective Dvorak 
current intensity estimate from TAFB was T2.5/35 kt, while 
objective estimates from UW-CIMSS have ranged from 26 to 34 kt over 
the past several hours. A timely 08/0534z Metop-B Ascat pass 
depicted quite a few 30 to 33 kt wind barbs and this was the basis 
for holding the initial intensity steady at 35 kt for this advisory.
 
Henriette is moving westward, or 280 degrees at 15 kt. A turn toward 
the west-northwest is expected soon, with this general motion 
expected to persist over the next couple of days as the cyclone 
tracks along the southwestern periphery of a subtropical ridge to 
its northeast. A turn toward the northwest is forecast this weekend 
and into early next week as Henriette becomes steered between an 
amplifying longwave trough northwest of Hawaii and the subtropical 
ridge to its northeast. The official track forecast remains in close 
agreement with the latest multi-model consensus aids and is very 
close to the previous advisory.  Confidence remains high that 
Henriette will remain far to the north of Hawaii.
 
Henriette will traverse sea surface temperatures near 24C with 
mid-level relative humidity below 50 percent during the next 24 
hours or so. Despite these unfavorable thermodynamic conditions, the 
cyclone’s well-defined circulation is expected to remain fairly 
resilient within the prevailing low-shear environment, allowing for 
occasional pulses of deep convection to continue.  As a result, 
little change in intensity is anticipated during the next day or so. 
If Henriette can withstand the next 24 hours over cooler waters, as 
continues to be indicated by the GFS and ECMWF models again with the 
00Z cycle, re-intensification will likely occur over the weekend and 
into early next week as sea surface temperatures steadily rise to 
levels conducive for strengthening.  The official forecast continues 
to reflect intensification, bringing Henriette to hurricane strength 
by 72 hours.  The cyclone will begin to experience increasing 
vertical wind shear as it moves toward the higher latitudes, which 
should result in rather rapid weakening beginning between 96 and 120 
hours.  The intensity forecast is on the higher end of the guidance 
envelope, and is most closely aligned with the CTCI and HMNI 
intensity aids, but below the peak depicted by the HAFS models.

Future information on Henriette can be found under Central Pacific 
basin headers beginning at 500 AM HST.  Future Tropical Cyclone 
Discussions will be issued under AWIPS header HFOTCDCP3 and WMO 
header WTPA43 PHFO.  Products will continue to be available on the 
web at hurricanes.gov.

BULLETIN
Tropical Storm Ivo Advisory Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
200 AM MST Fri Aug 08 2025
 
...IVO MOVING WEST-NORTHWESTWARD AWAY FROM MEXICO...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 200 AM MST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...20.4N 109.0W
ABOUT 180 MI...295 KM SSE OF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF BAJA CALIFORNIA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...60 MPH...95 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 21 MPH...33 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1001 MB...29.56 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
Interests along the coast of southwestern Mexico and the southern
portion of the Baja California peninsula should continue to monitor
the progress of Ivo.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 AM MST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ivo was 
located near latitude 20.4 North, longitude 109.0 West. Ivo is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 21 mph (33 km/h).  A decrease 
in forward speed and a turn to the west are expected on Saturday, 
and this motion should continue through the weekend. On the forecast 
track, Ivo is expected to pass well south of the Baja California 
peninsula.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Strengthening is forecast for the next day or so, and Ivo could 
become a hurricane later today or tonight. Weakening should begin 
over the weekend.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Ivo will continue to affect the 
southwestern coast of Mexico during the next day or so, and are 
forecast to reach the southern portion of the Baja California 
peninsula later today. These swells are likely to cause 
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult 
products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found
at: hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep4.shtml?ripCurrnets
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Tropical Storm Ivo Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
300 PM CST Thu Aug 07 2025
 
Ivo remains a very small tropical cyclone, though an intensifying 
one. Deep central convection continues to burst near the center, 
though the vertical structure of the tropical storm does appear more 
ragged with evidence that the mid-level vortex is tilted to the 
southwest of the low-level center. A helpful Metop-B scatterometer 
pass at 1643 UTC captured the tiny circulation with a max wind 
retrieval of 44 kt. Assuming this instrument undersampled the peak 
winds of the small cyclone, the initial intensity is being raised to 
50 kt for this advisory, also close to the latest objective ADT 
estimate.
 
The tropical storm continues to move quite quickly to the northwest,
with the motion estimated at 305/18 kt. The track forecast reasoning
is similar to earlier, where a strong and extensive mid-level ridge
parked over northern Mexico should keep Ivo moving quickly
west-northwestward to northwestward for the next 24 hours or so. On
this forecast track, Ivo will soon begin pulling away from the
southwestern coast of Mexico. By this weekend, the ridge begins to
weaken some and the guidance also suggests Ivo will start to become
more vertically shallow. A combination of these influences should
result in a westward turn in the track and a slowdown in the forward
motion. The track guidance for this cycle is quite similar to the
prior one, and the NHC track forecast is largely an update from
the previous one, blending the consensus aids HCCA and TVCE.
 
The intensity forecast presents a conundrum this afternoon. Ivo has 
a small inner core wind field, is over warm 29-30 C ocean waters, 
and vertical wind shear as diagnosed by SHIPS guidance is low, only 
5-10 kt. Ordinarily these variables would suggest that Ivo could 
undergo a period of rapid intensification (RI), and EC-SHIPS-RI 
guidance now has a 71 percent chance of a 30-kt increase over the 
next 24 h. However, other RI indices are lower, with DTOPS at only 
12 percent for the same threshold. There is also evidence that Ivo's 
structure is not ideal, with current visible satellite imagery 
suggesting its circulation is tilted southwest with height. This 
vertical tilt also matches the structure seen in the most recent 
HAFS-A/B model grids. This may explain why the regional-hurricane 
models are less aggressive with Ivo's intensification than SHIPS, 
and only HAFS-B briefly makes Ivo a hurricane. Thus the NHC 
intensity forecast is not as aggressive as the latest SHIPS 
guidance, only taking Ivo to a 70 kt hurricane in 24 hours. 
Thereafter, the storm will cross a sharp sea-surface temperature 
gradient, which should lead to weakening after 24 hours. Like the 
previous forecast, Ivo will likely lose its organized deep 
convection west of Baja California in about 72 hours, where the 
latest forecast shows it becoming a post-tropical remnant low. The 
NHC intensity forecast is a little above the reliable HCCA aid, but 
is lower than both SHIPS and LGEM aids.
 
Given the small radius of tropical-storm-force winds associated with
Ivo, these winds are expected to remain offshore as it begins to
move away from Mexico by tonight. However, heavy rain and rough surf
are likely to occur along portions of the southwest coast of Mexico
during the next day or so.  Outer bands of Ivo are expected to
produce locally heavy rainfall in portions of the Mexican states of
Guerrero, Michoacan de Ocampo and Colima through Friday where flash
flooding is possible.

Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082025
1100 AM HST Thu Aug 07 2025
 
Henriette has been producing a smaller area of deep convection than
earlier, as it seems to be struggling a bit with dry air and
sea-surface temperatures near 24 C.  The latest subjective Dvorak
current intensity estimates are 2.5/35 kt from TAFB and 1.5/25 kt
from SAB.  The latest objective estimates from UW-CIMMS range from
about 30 to 40 kt.  A recent 1914 UTC ASCAT-C pass suggests that 
Henriette has likely weakened a bit from earlier.  Based on the 
above data, the initial intensity is lowered to 40 kt for this 
advisory.
 
The motion of 280/14 kt is unchanged from the previous advisory.
This motion will continue through today as Henriette is steered by
mid-level ridging well to its north.  The cyclone will then round
the southwestern periphery of the mid-level ridge as a large
deep-layer trough approaches from the west.  These features will
cause Henriette to gradually turn toward the northwest in a couple
of days.  Very little change has been made to the NHC track
forecast, which lies near the tightly clustered consensus aids.
Confidence in the track forecast is high through the weekend, and
Henriette will not directly impact the Hawaiian Islands.
 
Henriette is expected to continue moving over cool ocean waters near 
24C for another 36 h before it begins to gradually move over 
increasing water temperatures.  The tropical storm will also 
continue moving through a very dry environment.  Most of the 
guidance shows the storm maintaining a 35-40 kt intensity during 
this time. Henriette is also expected to encounter colder than 
normal mid- and upper-level temperatures in a couple of days.  If 
Henriette survives the next 48 h or so, then strengthening would 
appear likely later in the forecast period due to increasing 
sea-surface temperatures, very low vertical wind shear, and 
decreasing mid- to upper-level temperatures as the aforementioned 
deep-layer trough approaches. The official forecast shows some 
slight weakening in the short term, followed by strengthening to a 
hurricane by day 4 well to the north of Hawaii.  The latest NHC 
forecast is near the intensity consensus and close to the higher end 
of the guidance at day 4 and 5.  It should be noted that the HAFS 
models are showing a slightly higher intensity than the NHC 
forecast.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
Interests along the coast of southwestern Mexico should continue to
monitor the progress of Ivo.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM CST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ivo was 
located near latitude 18.8 North, longitude 105.8 West. Ivo is 
moving toward the northwest near 21 mph (33 km/h). On the forecast 
track, Ivo is expected to start moving away from the coast of Mexico 
over the next day or so. The storm is forecast to turn more westward 
by the weekend. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 60 mph (95 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Strengthening is forecast for the next day or so, and Ivo could 
become a hurricane on Friday. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Ivo is expected to produce storm total
rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 6 inches,
across portions of the Mexican states of Guerrero, Michoacan de
Ocampo and Colima through Friday. This would result in an elevated
risk for flash flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Ivo please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep4.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ivo will be affecting the southwestern
coast of Mexico during the next couple of days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Mesoscale Discussion 1897
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0254 PM CDT Thu Aug 07 2025

Areas affected...parts of western and central North Dakota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 071954Z - 072200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Uncertainty lingers concerning potential thunderstorm
coverage and sustenance into and through 5-7 PM CDT.  However, any
sustained thunderstorm development may include rapidly intensifying
supercells accompanied by a risk for large hail, locally damaging
wind gusts  and perhaps a couple of tornadoes.

DISCUSSION...Along and southeast of a weak baroclinic zone, near the
leading edge of air impacted by outflow from now dissipated
convective development, boundary-layer air with seasonably high
moisture content is becoming characterized by moderate to strong
potential instability.  This is being supported by steep
lower/mid-tropospheric lapse rates associated a broad plume of warm
and capping elevated mixed-layer air overspreading much of the Great
Plains.  

Based on latest model output and objective analysis, the northern
periphery of the stronger capping may now be north of the surface
front, roughly near/northwest of the Dickinson through Garrison and
Minot vicinities.  However, large-scale scale ascent associated with
lower/mid-tropospheric warm advection, a subtle mid-level short wave
perturbation, and localized area of enhanced low-level convergence
might be sufficient to overcome mid-level inhibition and support the
initiation of at least isolated thunderstorm development late this
afternoon.  If this occurs, there appears potential for rapid
intensification, and the evolution of a large supercell, in the
presence of moderate to strong deep-layer shear beneath 30-40 kt
southwesterly flow around 500 mb. 

The environment appears conducive to the potential for large hail,
locally damaging surface gusts, and, despite modest low-level
hodographs, a risk for a couple of tornadoes.

Mesoscale Discussion 1896
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0249 PM CDT Thu Aug 07 2025

Areas affected...Parts of central and eastern Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 071949Z - 072145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Large hail and severe wind gusts will be possible this
afternoon, especially as storms move into eastern Montana. A watch
is possible when storm intensity trends become evident.

DISCUSSION...A broad area of mid-level ascent is evident on visible
satellite imagery in southwestern Montana. This forcing has promoted
widely scattered thunderstorms early this afternoon. Mid/upper
clouds associated with this band of ascent has so far kept buoyancy
rather weak near the terrain. Farther east, surface dewpoints have
gradually increased into the low/mid 50s F to mid/upper 60s F near
the North Dakota border. Given the strong ascent, it is likely that
scattered storms will eventually develop. Lingering MLCIN is present
from around Billings eastward. This should erode some with
additional afternoon heating. The main point of uncertainty is when
storms will intensify. This will probably occur in the next 2-3
hours when storms encounter greater moisture. Strong shear and
increasing buoyancy as convection moves east will support a threat
for initial supercells capable of large hail and severe winds.
Temperature-dewpoint spreads are large enough that storms will tend
to be outflow dominant and may congeal into one or more clusters. A
watch is possible this afternoon, but timing of when this will be
needed is not clear.

Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082025
1100 PM HST Wed Aug 06 2025
 
Satellite images indicate that a small burst of deep convection has 
developed just to the northwest of Henriette’s low-level center this 
evening, after several hours with not much more than a shallow cloud 
swirl.  The most recent subjective Dvorak current intensity estimate 
from TAFB was 3.0/45 kt, while the objective estimates from UW-CIMSS 
ranged between 32 to 42 kt over the past several hours.  A timely 
07/0645Z Metop-C ASCAT pass depicted several 40 kt wind barbs, with 
a single 40–45 kt wind barb noted north of the low-level center.  
The initial intensity for this advisory will be held at 45 kt, 
utilizing the ASCAT data while accounting for some undersampling and 
a known low bias at higher speeds. 

The cyclone is moving westward, or 275 degrees, at 14 kt. This 
general motion is expected to persist through Thursday, as Henriette 
continues to be steered by a strengthening subtropical ridge to its 
north.  A gradual turn toward the west-northwest and eventually 
northwest is anticipated Friday and over the weekend, as an 
amplifying longwave trough northwest of Hawaii begins to erode the 
western extent of the subtropical ridge. The northwestward motion is 
expected to continue into early next week.  The official track 
forecast remains closely aligned with the latest multi-model 
consensus aids and is nearly identical to the previous advisory.

Henriette will be moving over gradually cooling sea surface 
temperatures near 24C, while the environmental humidities 
surrounding the cyclone will drop below 50 percent.  Despite these 
hostile thermodynamic conditions, Henriette’s well-established 
circulation is likely to remain resilient due to the low-shear 
environment the cyclone will be transiting through.  As a result, 
only a slight weakening is forecast tonight, followed by little 
change in strength during the next few days.  If Henriette can 
survive the passage over the cool waters, as persistently suggested 
by the GFS and ECMWF models for several days now, re-intensification 
appears likely over the weekend and into early next week as sea 
surface temperatures warm to levels conducive for strengthening.  
The official forecast continues to reflect this, bringing Henriette 
to hurricane strength by 120 hours.  The intensity forecast is 
mostly unchanged and remains aligned best with the dynamical 
intensity consensus aid HCCA and the regional hurricane models.

Tropical Storm Ivo Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
300 AM CST Thu Aug 07 2025
 
Ivo's satellite presentation is that of a storm that is steadily 
intensifying.  Deep convection has been continuously forming while 
the central deep overcast has been expanding through the evening.  
However, overnight scatterometer data from 0412 UTC revealed a 
dubious, at best, low-level circulation. The data suggests that 
even though the mid-level rotation appears robust, the low-level 
flow has yet to reflect such organization, likely due to Ivo's rapid 
forward motion.  The intensity is held at 35 kt based on the latest 
satellite-derived wind data.

The motion is estimated to be 295/20 kt.  Ivo is racing along the 
southern side of a strong mid-level ridge centered over the 
southwestern United States.  This motion is expected to continue 
for the next day or so which should keep the tropical cyclone 
moving parallel to, but offshore of, the coast of southwestern 
Mexico.  Around 36 h, Ivo is expected to turn more westward and slow 
down.  The latest NHC track forecast is slightly faster than the 
previous forecast and lies between the various consensus aids.
 
Ivo is still forecast to steadily strengthen over then next day or 
so.  Moderate vertical wind shear, warm sea surface temperatures, 
and a moist environment should provide the necessary conditions for 
the cyclone to reach hurricane status within the next couple of 
days.  Ivo is expected to cross over cooler waters by 72 h, which 
should induce a gradual weakening trend.  Global models predict 
increasing shear will separate the cyclone from deep convection and 
Ivo is now forecast to become post-tropical by 96 h.  The official 
intensity forecast remains at the high end of the model guidance.
 
The tropical-storm-force winds associated with Ivo are expected to
remain offshore of the coast of Mexico, however heavy rain and
rough surf are likely along portions of the southwest coast of
Mexico during the next day or so.  Outer bands of Ivo are expected 
to produce locally heavy rainfall in portions of the Mexican states 
of Guerrero, Michoacan de Ocampo and Colima through Friday. Flash 
flooding is possible.

...IVO RACING WEST-NORTHWESTWARD OFF THE SOUTHWESTERN MEXICAN
COASTLINE...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 AM CST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.9N 103.0W
ABOUT 215 MI...350 KM WSW OF ACAPULCO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 23 MPH...37 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1008 MB...29.77 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
Interests along the coast of southwestern Mexico should monitor the
progress of Ivo.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM CST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ivo was 
located near latitude 15.9 North, longitude 103.0 West. Ivo is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 23 mph (37 km/h).  The system 
is forecast to move generally parallel to, but offshore of, the 
coast of Mexico during the next day or so and turn westward away 
from Mexico thereafter.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast, and Ivo is expected to be near hurricane
strength by the end of the week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Ivo is expected to produce storm total
rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 6 inches,
across portions of the Mexican states of Guerrero, Michoacan de
Ocampo and Colima through Friday. This would result in an elevated
risk for flash flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Depression Nine-E, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep4.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ivo will be affecting the southwestern
coast of Mexico during the next couple of days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found

Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082025
1100 AM HST Wed Aug 06 2025
 
Henriette continues along with little change in its structure. Like 
6 h ago, it is producing a relatively small area of deep convection, 
with cold cloud tops present mostly to the north of its low-level 
center. Recent scatterometer data showed winds just above 40 kt, 
which supports maintaining the intensity at 45 kt for this 
advisory, after accounting for undersampling. The scatterometer data 
was also helpful with identifying the exact position of Henriette's 
center, which was slightly south of previous estimates.
 
No significant change was made to the NHC track forecast outside a 
slight southward adjustment based on the initial position estimate 
in the short term. Henriette is moving westward to 
west-northwestward to the south of a deep ridge centered over the 
northern east Pacific. In a few days, a trough approaching from the 
west will turn Henriette toward the northwest, taking the tropical 
cyclone north of Hawaii. The various deterministic and global 
ensemble models are all in good agreement on the forecast, so 
confidence in the track forecast is fairly high.
 
The tropical storm is still forecast to slowly weaken during the 
next few days while it moves over cool SSTs near 24C. However, once 
Henriette moves north of Hawaii, it will move over warmer waters. 
Upper-level difluent flow associated with a mid-latitude trough to 
the northwest may also provide additional support for 
intensification. As a result, most of the dynamical models forecast 
strengthening to occur near the end of the forecast period, and the 
NHC intensity forecast reflects this and is very similar to the 
previous advisory.

Tropical Storm Ivo Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
300 PM CST Wed Aug 06 2025

One-minute GOES-E visible imagery, microwave imagery and 
scatterometer data from this morning indicate that the disturbance 
south of Mexico has become much better organized. The system has 
developed banding features, and the most recent TAFB Dvorak analysis 
shows a Final-T of 2.0. The ASCAT data showed peak winds between 
30-35 kt, so advisories have been initiated on Tropical Storm Ivo, 
with an initial intensity of 35 kt.

Ivo has a relatively small circulation, but it's embedded within a 
fairly large area of deep convection. SHIPS diagnostics indicate 
that wind shear could be a limiting factor for Ivo's intensity 
during the next couple of days, but the tropical storm is in an 
otherwise conducive environment for strengthening. The NHC forecast 
follows the multi-model consensus and shows Ivo reaching hurricane 
strength within the next couple of days, but there is about 30 kt of 
spread in the intensity guidance, both above and below the official 
forecast.

Ivo is moving fairly quickly toward the west-northwest near 19 kt. A 
deep-layer ridge centered over the southwestern U.S. should steer 
Ivo parallel to the coast of Mexico for the next couple of days. 
The ridge is forecast to weaken by the weekend, causing Ivo to move 
at a slower forward speed, but by then Ivo will reach cooler SSTs 
and a more stable environment. That should cause the cyclone to 
quickly weaken and turn westward, steered primarily by low-level 
flow. The NHC track forecast is near the center of the guidance 
envelope, very close to HCCA throughout the 5-day period.

The tropical-storm-force winds associated with Ivo are expected to 
remain offshore of the coast of Mexico, however heavy rain and 
rough surf are likely along portions of the southwest coast of 
Mexico during the next day or two.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM CST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ivo was
located near latitude 14.2 North, longitude 99.1 West. Ivo is moving
toward the west-northwest near 22 mph (35 km/h). The tropical storm 
is forecast to move generally parallel, but offshore of the coast 
of Mexico during the couple of days, and then turn westward, moving 
further from land.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is anticipated for the next couple of days. Ivo is 
forecast to be near hurricane strength by the end of the week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Ivo is expected to produce storm total 
rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 6 inches, 
across portions of the Mexican states of Guerrero, Michoacan and 
southwestern Oaxaca through Saturday. This rainfall could lead to 
flash flooding. 

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Tropical Depression Nine-E, please see the National Weather Service 
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic available at 
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep4.shtml?rainqpf

SURF:  Swells generated by Ivo will be affecting the southwestern 
coast of Mexico during the next couple of days. These swells are 
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082025
1100 PM HST Tue Aug 05 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Henriette has changed little since the 
previous advisory, with intermittent bursts of deep convection 
continuing, primarily located over and west of the cyclone’s 
low-level center.  Recent subjective Dvorak intensity estimates from 
TAFB and SAB were 3.0/45 kt and 2.5/35 kt, respectively, while 
objective estimates from UW-CIMSS have ranged between 34 and 46 kt 
over the past several hours.  A timely 06/0525Z Metop-C ASCAT pass 
revealed several 40–45 kt wind barbs north of the low-level center. 
Based on these data, the initial intensity for this advisory remains 
45 kt.

Henriette has recently turned toward the west, or 280 degrees, at 13 
kt. This general motion is expected to persist over the next couple 
of days as the cyclone is steered by a strengthening subtropical 
ridge situated to the north.  By around 72 hours, a gradual turn 
toward the west-northwest or northwest is anticipated as an 
amplifying longwave trough northwest of Hawaii begins to erode the 
western periphery of the ridge.  The official track forecast is 
closely aligned with the latest multi-model consensus aids and 
remains very similar to the previous advisory.

Henriette is forecast to remain in a low vertical wind shear 
environment for the next several days. During this period, sea 
surface temperatures are expected to gradually decrease to near or 
slightly below 24C, while mid-level moisture drops below 50 percent. 
Despite these marginal thermodynamic conditions, Henriette’s broad 
circulation and well-established inner core should allow the system 
to remain relatively resilient in the low shear environment.  Only 
slight weakening is forecast during the next few days, followed by 
little change in strength.  Toward the end of the forecast period, 
sea surface temperatures are expected to rise again.  If the system 
manages to endure the cooler waters, as persistently suggested by 
both the GFS and ECMWF models, some re-intensification is possible.  
The official forecast reflects this potential and lies near the 
middle of the intensity guidance envelope.

Mesoscale Discussion 1890
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0240 PM CDT Tue Aug 05 2025

Areas affected...south central North Dakota and adjacent north
central South Dakota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 051940Z - 052145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Intensifying thunderstorm activity, perhaps including the
evolution of a sustained supercell appears probable by 5-7 PM CDT,
if not earlier, before transitioning to an organizing, southeastward
propagating cluster into this evening.  A severe weather watch will
likely be needed, but timing remains uncertain.

DISCUSSION...In the wake of a generally dissipating cluster of
thunderstorms spreading into the Red River Valley,
lower/mid-tropospheric warm advection is being maintained across
much of the Dakotas, on the northern periphery of a plume of warm
and capping elevated mixed-layer air.  This includes temperatures as
warm as +10 to +12 C around 700 mb, as far northeast as southwestern
North Dakota through north central and northeastern South Dakota,
beneath which stronger boundary-layer warming and destabilization is
ongoing.

Around and north through east of the Bismarck ND vicinity, the
boundary-layer has been slower to modify in the wake of the
preceding convection, but forcing for ascent has been sufficient to
overcome inhibition and support renewed thunderstorm development. 
This has been gradually increasing near the nose of a 30 kt
southerly low-level jet, which may strengthen a bit further into
early evening.  Northward advection of warmer and more moist
boundary-layer air along this axis is likely to contribute to
substantive further boundary-layer destabilization, and, at some
point, a rapid intensification of thunderstorm activity.  

Once this occurs, in the presence of strong deep-layer shear beneath
30-40 kt westerly 500 mb flow, the environment appears conducive to
the evolution of a significant supercell with potential to produce
large hail and perhaps a couple of tornadoes, before growing growing
upscale into an organizing southeastward propagating cluster by this
evening.

Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082025
1100 AM HST Tue Aug 05 2025
 
This morning's satellite presentation consists of a convective
curved band on the west side of the cyclone and a cluster of strong
thunderstorms with cold cloud tops of -70 Celsius just to the west 
of Henriette's surface circulation center.  The initial intensity is
held at 45 kt for this advisory and is based on a blend of the
TAFB and SAB subjective and CIMSS objective intensity estimates.
 
Little change in strength is expected during the next couple of 
days, although 5-kt fluctuations are possible, while Henriette 
moves  over slightly cooler water and through an increasingly 
inhibiting thermodynamic environment.  Toward the end of the week, 
the thermodynamic environment is expected to become even more
hostile while Henriette moves over the subtropical central
Pacific waters.  Therefore, some weakening of the cyclone is 
forecast through day 5.  The official intensity forecast is based 
on the IVCN intensity consensus model and the Decay-SHIPS 
statistical aid.
 
Henriette's initial motion is estimated to be west-northwestward,
or 295/13 kt, and a west-northwestward or westward motion should 
continue through day 4 while the cyclone is steered by a strong 
mid-level ridge stretching across the subtropical Central Pacific.  
Over the weekend, Henriette is expected to turn gradually 
northwestward in response to an amplifying mid- to 
upper-tropospheric trough approaching the Hawaiian Islands from the
Central North Pacific.  The NHC track forecast is based on the 
various consensus aids and is basically an update of the previous 
advisory.

Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082025
1100 PM HST Mon Aug 04 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Henriette has degraded some since the 
previous advisory, with cloud tops warming and the curved band 
structure becoming more fragmented.  The latest subjective Dvorak 
intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB are both 3.0/45 kt, while 
objective estimates from UW-CIMSS have ranged from 37 to 46 kt 
during the past several hours.  Meanwhile, a timely 05/0545Z Metop-C 
ASCAT pass showed several 40-45 kt wind barbs, assisting with 
determining the initial intensity as well as the extent of the 
tropical-storm-force wind radii.  The initial intensity for this 
advisory has been held at 45 kt.

The cyclone is moving west-northwest, or 290 degrees, at 13 knots.  
This general motion is expected to continue during the next day or 
so, as Henriette moves along the southern edge of a subtropical 
ridge to the north.  Between 36 and 72 hours, a slight turn toward 
the west is forecast as the ridge strengthens north of the cyclone.  
Beyond 72 hours, a turn back toward the west-northwest or northwest 
is anticipated as an amplifying longwave trough northwest of Hawaii 
erodes the western extent of the subtropical ridge steering the 
cyclone.  The official track forecast closely follows a blend of 
the latest HCCA/TVCE/FSSE consensus guidance, and is very close to 
the track from the previous advisory.

Henriette appears to have a brief window for further intensification 
over the next 12 to 18 hours, as sea surface temperatures hover 
between 26 and 26.5C, mid-level moisture remains sufficient, and 
vertical wind shear stays light.  Little change in strength is 
expected then through 36 hours as the cyclone moves over slightly 
cooler water but close to the 26C isotherm, while shear remains 
light and the mid-levels remain moist. Beyond 36 hours, the cyclone 
is expected to move over progressively cooler waters, with mid-level 
moisture decreasing, and these conditions should lead to gradual 
weakening. The official forecast maintains Henriette as a tropical 
cyclone through 120 hours, however, it would not be surprising if it 
transitions into a post-tropical low prior to day 5. The intensity 
forecast is most closely aligned with the FSSE, which is near the 
middle of the intensity guidance envelope.

Mesoscale Discussion 1886
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0338 PM CDT Mon Aug 04 2025

Areas affected...northeast WY...southeast MT...and western SD

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 042038Z - 042215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...A few supercells may develop with a threat of severe
hail/wind downstream of the Big Horn Mountains and along the
western/southern slopes of the Black Hills. While overall
coverage/intensity should be less compared to farther south in the
central High Plains, Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance is possible
in the next couple hours.

DISCUSSION...Initial high-based, low-topped thunderstorms have
formed along the lee of the Big Horn Mountains, with a separate arc
of congested CU along the west to south flank of the Black Hills.
Much of the region between and ahead of these regimes is
characterized by upper 40s to mid 50s surface dew points with large
temperature/dew point spreads. This is yielding more modest buoyancy
relative to eastern CO and southwest NE. Still, moderate deep-layer
shear should support a few high-based supercells across southwest SD
into the northeast WY/far southeast MT vicinity by early evening. A
mix of sporadic severe hail and wind appears possible. Expected
coverage/intensity appears marginally supportive of Severe
Thunderstorm Watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1885
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0335 PM CDT Mon Aug 04 2025

Areas affected...Central Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 042035Z - 042230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered storms are expected to develop through the
afternoon within the higher terrain. These will spread
north/northeast and produce severe winds and isolated large hail. A
watch is possible for parts of central/eastern Montana.

DISCUSSION...Beneath a plume of cirrus overspreading the northern
Rockies, thunderstorms are beginning to initiate and deepen within
southwest into central Montana this afternoon. Additional cumulus
development is also noted along the weak surface trough. Greater
surface heating and moisture farther east has allowed MLCIN to erode
away from the terrain. It may take another 1-2 hours for MLCIN near
the terrain to erode. Over the remainder of the afternoon, scattered
thunderstorms will likely develop and move north and east. Moisture
will have some tendency to mix out where surface heating occurs, but
should support 1000-1500 J/kg MLCAPE. Shear is currently weak within
the region per VAD and 18Z TFX sounding data. However, this should
improve as the compact mid-level jet moves through the northern
Rockies this evening. Some supercell structures along with linear
segments will be possible. The main hazard will be severe wind gusts
given the large temperature-dewpoint spreads. Isolated large hail
may also occur, especially with supercells.

Mesoscale Discussion 1884
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0307 PM CDT Mon Aug 04 2025

Areas affected...the central High Plains

Concerning...Severe potential...Severe Thunderstorm Watch likely 

Valid 042007Z - 042200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated supercells capable of very large hail, severe
gusts, and a brief tornado or two are possible across parts of the
central High Plains. A single or pair of Severe Thunderstorm Watches
will likely be needed.

DISCUSSION...Widely scattered high-based CU/CBs have been noted from
the Laramie Mountains to Pikes Peak, with isolated development along
the South Platte and AR Valleys in eastern CO. Much of this initial
activity is occurring where surface dew point depressions of 35-45 F
are common. This suggests convection may struggle to rapidly
intensify, but should gradually strengthen into early evening.
Farther east, the western extent of low to mid 60s surface dewpoints
exists across far eastern CO, yielding much more ample MLCAPE. Most
guidance suggests at least one storm should become sustained in
southeast CO over the AR Valley and could be a longer-lasting
supercell given the environment. Otherwise, the higher-based
convection to the west and northwest will probably consist of
outflow-dominated supercell structures with a mix of sporadic large
hail and severe gusts.

Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082025
1100 AM HST Mon Aug 04 2025
 
Conventional satellite imagery shows that the cyclone has become 
better organized, during the past several hours.  A curved band has
developed over the west side of the cyclone, and deep convection is
developing over the surface center.  A 1336 UTC ESA Soil Moisture
Ocean Salinity (SMOS) overpass indicated 34-40 kt winds in the
north quadrant of the cyclone, and a 1746 UTC ASCAT-B pass
revealed 38 kt winds in the same region.  ADT/AiDT and ATMS
sounder objective satellite intensity estimates yield 34 kts, while
the subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB support 35 kt.
Based on these data, the depression has been upgraded to Tropical
Storm Henriette with the initial intensity set at 40 kt.
 
The intensity forecast philosophy is unchanged from the previous one 
with gradual strengthening expected during the next couple of days.  
By mid-period, Henriette should slowly weaken and then level off 
with little change in strength as it traverses cooler oceanic 
surface temperatures and moves into a drier, more stable surrounding 
environment.  The NHC intensity forecast has been lowered a bit to 
agree more with the Decay-SHIPS, the IVCN intensity consensus model, 
and the GFS and ECMWF deterministic models.  
 
The initial motion is estimated to be west-northwestward, or 295/13 
kt.  The global models indicate that a strong mid- to 
upper-tropospheric ridge anchored to the north of the cyclone should 
continue to steer Henriette in this general direction through 96 
hours.  Around day 5, a gradual turn toward the northwest is 
expected in response to a mid-latitude mid-level trough moving 
toward the Hawaiian Islands from the north-central Pacific.

Tropical Depression Eight-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082025
1100 PM HST Sun Aug 03 2025
 
Showers and thunderstorms associated with an area of low pressure
well southwest of the Baja California Peninsula have become better
organized during the past 12 hours. Additionally, an overnight ASCAT
pass showed a well-defined circulation with peak winds near 30 kt.
Given the improved convective organization and well-defined
circulation, advisories are being initiated on Tropical Depression
Eight-E. The initial intensity is set at 30 kt, based on a blend of
the ASCAT pass and Dvorak current intensity estimates from both
TAFB and SAB.
 
The initial motion is estimated at 300/13 kt, along the southern
side of a strong subtropical ridge. This ridge is forecast to remain
in place through the 5-day period, steering the system generally
west-northwestward for the entire forecast. A slightly more westward
motion is possible by day 4 as the cyclone becomes more shallow and
is steered within the low- to mid-level flow. The updated track
forecast is close to the consensus aids.
 
The system is forecast to steadily strengthen during the next couple 
of days as it moves over warm waters and through a moist, low-shear 
environment. It is expected to become a tropical storm on Monday 
and could approach hurricane strength between 36 and 60 hours. After 
that time, a gradual weakening trend is anticipated as the cyclone 
moves over sea surface temperatures below 26 degrees C and begins to 
entrain drier mid-level air within a more stable environment. 
Simulated satellite imagery from the global models supports this 
scenario, showing a reduction in deep convection as the system 
continues west-northwestward into the central Pacific basin. The 
forecast is slightly above the intensity guidance through 60 hours, 
then is in good agreement with the consensus aids thereafter.

Mesoscale Discussion 1879
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0349 PM CDT Sun Aug 03 2025

Areas affected...western KS

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 032049Z - 032245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms will track
south/southeast across western Kansas through early evening. Large
hail and strong gusts are possible with the strongest storms.

DISCUSSION...Isolated thunderstorms have developed this afternoon
along the strong moisture gradient across northwest KS. Steep
midlevel lapse rates near 8 C/km are aiding in moderate to strong
destabilization with MLCAPE values near 2000-2500 J/kg. While
vertical shear is somewhat modest across northwest KS, these storms
will encounter stronger effective shear magnitudes greater than 30
kt as they track south. These storms will also move into the more
moist boundary layer. As a result, additional convection or
intensification is possible with time and southward extent. The
favorable thermodynamic and kinematic environment will support
isolated large hail. Additionally, some guidance suggests clustering
could occur toward evening. If this scenario occurs, damaging wind
potential could increase as well.  Trends will be monitored for
possible watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1878
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0336 PM CDT Sun Aug 03 2025

Areas affected...portions of northeast NM into the OK/TX Panhandles

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 032036Z - 032230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated thunderstorms will develop southeast from
northeast New Mexico into the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles the next
few hours. A few instances of large hail and strong/severe gusts are
possible.

DISCUSSION...Isolated thunderstorms are developing this afternoon
within low-level convergence/upslope. Strong heating has allowed
temperatures to climb into the low to mid 80s F behind morning
convection and outflow. South/southeasterly low-level winds have
maintained mid-60s F dewpoints beneath steep midlevel lapse rates.
This is fostering moderate destabilization, with 1000-2000 J/kg
MLCAPE noted in 20z mesoanalysis. Vertically veering winds profiles,
with increasing northwesterly flow aloft is contributing to fairly
robust shear, with effective shear magnitudes greater than 40 kts
apparent in regional VWP and mesoanalysis data. This environment
will support organized cells capable of producing large hail and
strong/severe gusts. Convective coverage remains uncertain, but
could increase with southward extent toward evening. This area is
being monitored for possible severe thunderstorm watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1877
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0244 PM CDT Sun Aug 03 2025

Areas affected...Southwestern into parts of eastern Oregon

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 031944Z - 032145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered afternoon thunderstorms will be capable of
strong to severe wind gusts and mainly small hail. A watch is not
expected this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Cumulus towers continue to deepen along and east of the
Cascades in southwest Oregon. This is in response to an approaching
shortwave trough. While these thunderstorms have been slow to move
off of the terrain thus far, continued heating in southern/eastern
Oregon will likely erode remaining MLCIN within the next 1-2 hours.
Additional storm development is likely through the afternoon as
well. With elevated convection associated with a small-scale
perturbation moving through northeast Oregon, development within the
Blue Mountains is less certain. However, additional heating during
the afternoon may still be sufficient for this to occur. Steep low
and mid-level lapse rates and 20-25 kts of shear (which will
marginally improve to near 30 kts with time) will result in
marginally organized storms capable of severe wind gusts.
Thermodynamic profiles will be conducive to mainly small hail, but
isolated hail near 1 inch could occur in the most intense storms.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Gil Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072025
500 AM HST Sun Aug 03 2025
 
Cool waters combined with a drier and more stable environment have 
taken their toll on Gil. The system has been devoid of deep 
convection overnight, with only an exposed swirl of low- to 
mid-level clouds remaining. The initial intensity is lowered to 45 
kt, based on a blend of the latest subjective Dvorak estimates from 
TAFB and SAB and objective estimates from UW-CIMSS. Given the cool 
waters, dry and stable air, and strengthening west-southwesterly 
shear, no new organized convection is expected. Therefore, this will 
be the final advisory on the system as it has become post-tropical. 
Gil is expected to dissipate around midweek as it opens into a 
trough northeast of the Hawaiian Islands.

The initial motion is estimated at 285/16 kt. The system is being 
steered by a low- to mid-level ridge to its north, and this general 
motion is expected to continue into tonight. A gradual decrease in 
forward speed is anticipated by Monday, followed by a turn toward 
the west as the shallow remnant low becomes steered by the low-level 
flow. The updated track forecast remains close to the previous 
advisory and continues to follow the tightly clustered guidance 
envelope.
 
For additional information on the post-tropical low please see High
Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS
header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at

Tropical Storm Gil Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072025
1100 PM HST Sat Aug 02 2025
 
Satellite imagery shows the convection north of the low-level 
circulation quickly diminishing as Gil continues west-northwestward 
over progressively cooler waters and into a more stable environment. 
A timely ASCAT pass revealed peak winds of around 45 kt in the 
northern semicircle. Subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates 
from TAFB and SAB range from 3.0/45 kt to 3.5/55 kt, which are 
slightly higher than objective satellite estimates. Based on a blend 
of these data and the ASCAT pass, the initial intensity is set at 50 
kt.
 
The initial motion is estimated at 290/16 kt. Gil is being steered
by a mid-level ridge to its north, and this general motion is
expected to continue Sunday. A gradual decrease in forward
speed is anticipated by Monday, followed by a turn toward the west
as the shallow remnant low becomes steered by the low-level flow. 
The updated track forecast remains close to the previous advisory 
and continues to follow the tightly clustered guidance envelope.
 
Continued movement over progressively cooler waters, intrusion of 
dry mid-level air, and the onset of increasing west-southwesterly 
shear should accelerate Gil’s weakening trend. Simulated satellite 
imagery from global models continues to suggest that Gil will lose 
its deep convection and become post-tropical late Sunday, or in 
about 24 hours. The system is then forecast to gradually spin down 
and dissipate within a few days, likely by day 4, as it opens into 
a trough northeast of the Hawaiian Islands.

Day 2 Convective Outlook CORR 1

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN ROCKIES INTO THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN PLAINS...

CORRECTED FOR FLIPPED LINE IN NORTHEAST

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms with severe gusts and hail will be possible
on Monday from parts of the northern Rockies into the Dakotas and
central High Plains.

...Northern Rockies/Northern High Plains...
A mid-level shortwave trough will move northeastward across the
Pacific Northwest on Monday. At the surface, a cold front will
advance eastward into the northern Rockies, as upslope easterly flow
remains over the northern High Plains. As surface temperatures warm,
thunderstorm development is expected during the afternoon near the
front, and in the higher terrain of the northern Rockies. These
storms will likely increase in coverage by early evening, moving
eastward into the northern High Plains. Surface dewpoints across
much central and eastern Montana are forecast to be in the upper 40s
and lower 50s F, which will contribute to the development of weak
instability by afternoon. Near the forecast pocket of instability,
forecast soundings suggest that 0-6 km shear will be in the 30 to 40
knot range. This, combined with steep low to mid-level lapse rates
near 8 C/km, will likely support an localized severe threat. The
stronger rotating cells could produce hail. Isolated severe gusts
will also be possible, mainly with short line segments that have
some organization.

...Central and Northern Plains...
A mid-level ridge will remain over the central Rockies on Monday, as
a trough remains nearly stationary across northern Minnesota. At the
surface, a north-to-south corridor of low-level moisture with
dewpoints in the 60s F, will be in place from central Kansas
northward into the eastern Dakotas. Moderate instability is forecast
to develop along the western edge of this moist airmass, from
western Nebraska into southwestern and central South Dakota. As
destabilization takes place during the day, isolated thunderstorm
development will be possible, mainly in areas where low-level
convergence becomes maximized. Across much of the region, 0-6 km
shear is forecast to be in the 35 to 45 knot range. This will
support an isolated threat for severe gusts. Hail will also be
possible in the central High Plains, where mid-level lapse rates are
forecast to be steep.
