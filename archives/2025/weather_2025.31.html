Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0403 AM CDT Mon Aug 04 2025

Valid 071200Z - 121200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Thursday/Day 4 to Saturday/Day 6...
During the late week time-frame, a mid-level trough is forecast to
develop over the Pacific Northwest and move eastward into the
northern Plains. As the system approaches, a moist and unstable
airmass is forecast across the northern Plains and upper Mississippi
Valley. On Thursday, a lead shortwave trough is forecast to move
across the northern Plains. Large-scale ascent associated with the
trough could result in a cluster of storms with an isolated severe
threat from Thursday evening into the overnight period. Isolated to
scattered thunderstorms may again develop Friday afternoon and
evening, as the exit region of a mid-level jet moves across the
northern Plains. As instability becomes maximized on Friday
afternoon, a severe threat will be possible across parts of the
Dakotas and Minnesota. Large hail and severe gusts will be the
primary threats. The models are in reasonably good agreement on the
timing of the mid-level system. For this reason, have added a 15
percent into the northern Plains to coincide with the projected
locations of the instability axis and mid-level jet.

On Saturday, the mid-level trough is forecast to move into the
northern Plains, as a belt of southwesterly flow shifts eastward
across the Upper Midwest. Thunderstorm development will be possible
in the afternoon and evening, to the east of a front within an
unstable airmass in the upper Mississippi Valley. Moderate
deep-layer shear will again support an isolated severe threat across
the region.

...Sunday/Day 7 and Monday/Day 8...
The front is forecast to move southeastward into the upper
Mississippi Valley on Sunday. This will favor thunderstorm
development along a corridor from Iowa northeastward into Wisconsin,
where an isolated severe threat will be possible in the afternoon
and evening. On Monday, forecasts suggest the instability axis will
remain in a similar location. For this reason, a severe threat could
again affect this same corridor. Due to the extended range in the
forecast, there is some uncertainty concerning this scenario early
next week.

Tropical Depression Eight-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082025
1100 PM HST Sun Aug 03 2025
 
Showers and thunderstorms associated with an area of low pressure
well southwest of the Baja California Peninsula have become better
organized during the past 12 hours. Additionally, an overnight ASCAT
pass showed a well-defined circulation with peak winds near 30 kt.
Given the improved convective organization and well-defined
circulation, advisories are being initiated on Tropical Depression
Eight-E. The initial intensity is set at 30 kt, based on a blend of
the ASCAT pass and Dvorak current intensity estimates from both
TAFB and SAB.
 
The initial motion is estimated at 300/13 kt, along the southern
side of a strong subtropical ridge. This ridge is forecast to remain
in place through the 5-day period, steering the system generally
west-northwestward for the entire forecast. A slightly more westward
motion is possible by day 4 as the cyclone becomes more shallow and
is steered within the low- to mid-level flow. The updated track
forecast is close to the consensus aids.
 
The system is forecast to steadily strengthen during the next couple 
of days as it moves over warm waters and through a moist, low-shear 
environment. It is expected to become a tropical storm on Monday 
and could approach hurricane strength between 36 and 60 hours. After 
that time, a gradual weakening trend is anticipated as the cyclone 
moves over sea surface temperatures below 26 degrees C and begins to 
entrain drier mid-level air within a more stable environment. 
Simulated satellite imagery from the global models supports this 
scenario, showing a reduction in deep convection as the system 
continues west-northwestward into the central Pacific basin. The 
forecast is slightly above the intensity guidance through 60 hours, 
then is in good agreement with the consensus aids thereafter.

Mesoscale Discussion 1879
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0349 PM CDT Sun Aug 03 2025

Areas affected...western KS

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 032049Z - 032245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms will track
south/southeast across western Kansas through early evening. Large
hail and strong gusts are possible with the strongest storms.

DISCUSSION...Isolated thunderstorms have developed this afternoon
along the strong moisture gradient across northwest KS. Steep
midlevel lapse rates near 8 C/km are aiding in moderate to strong
destabilization with MLCAPE values near 2000-2500 J/kg. While
vertical shear is somewhat modest across northwest KS, these storms
will encounter stronger effective shear magnitudes greater than 30
kt as they track south. These storms will also move into the more
moist boundary layer. As a result, additional convection or
intensification is possible with time and southward extent. The
favorable thermodynamic and kinematic environment will support
isolated large hail. Additionally, some guidance suggests clustering
could occur toward evening. If this scenario occurs, damaging wind
potential could increase as well.  Trends will be monitored for
possible watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1878
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0336 PM CDT Sun Aug 03 2025

Areas affected...portions of northeast NM into the OK/TX Panhandles

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 032036Z - 032230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated thunderstorms will develop southeast from
northeast New Mexico into the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles the next
few hours. A few instances of large hail and strong/severe gusts are
possible.

DISCUSSION...Isolated thunderstorms are developing this afternoon
within low-level convergence/upslope. Strong heating has allowed
temperatures to climb into the low to mid 80s F behind morning
convection and outflow. South/southeasterly low-level winds have
maintained mid-60s F dewpoints beneath steep midlevel lapse rates.
This is fostering moderate destabilization, with 1000-2000 J/kg
MLCAPE noted in 20z mesoanalysis. Vertically veering winds profiles,
with increasing northwesterly flow aloft is contributing to fairly
robust shear, with effective shear magnitudes greater than 40 kts
apparent in regional VWP and mesoanalysis data. This environment
will support organized cells capable of producing large hail and
strong/severe gusts. Convective coverage remains uncertain, but
could increase with southward extent toward evening. This area is
being monitored for possible severe thunderstorm watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1877
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0244 PM CDT Sun Aug 03 2025

Areas affected...Southwestern into parts of eastern Oregon

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 031944Z - 032145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered afternoon thunderstorms will be capable of
strong to severe wind gusts and mainly small hail. A watch is not
expected this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Cumulus towers continue to deepen along and east of the
Cascades in southwest Oregon. This is in response to an approaching
shortwave trough. While these thunderstorms have been slow to move
off of the terrain thus far, continued heating in southern/eastern
Oregon will likely erode remaining MLCIN within the next 1-2 hours.
Additional storm development is likely through the afternoon as
well. With elevated convection associated with a small-scale
perturbation moving through northeast Oregon, development within the
Blue Mountains is less certain. However, additional heating during
the afternoon may still be sufficient for this to occur. Steep low
and mid-level lapse rates and 20-25 kts of shear (which will
marginally improve to near 30 kts with time) will result in
marginally organized storms capable of severe wind gusts.
Thermodynamic profiles will be conducive to mainly small hail, but
isolated hail near 1 inch could occur in the most intense storms.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0340 PM CDT Sun Aug 03 2025

Valid 051200Z - 111200Z

A persistent mid/upper-level trough is forecast to remain across the
Northwest U.S. Day 3/Tuesday into Day 7/Saturday. Meanwhile, a
mid/upper-level ridge centered over the Desert Southwest Day
3/Sunday is forecast to slowly build northwestward into the southern
Great Basin through at least Day 6/Friday while remaining
quasistationary over the Desert Southwest. 

...Great Basin/Southwest/Rocky Mountains: Day 3/Tuesday - Day
6/Friday...
Multiple days of hot, dry and windy conditions are expected across
the Great Basin, northern Arizona, and western portions of the Rocky
Mountains Day 3/Tuesday through Day 6/Friday. At this time, critical
fire weather conditions appear most likely across portions of
central/southern Utah, far northern Arizona, and far eastern Nevada
Day 3/Tuesday and Day 4/Wednesday as mid/upper-level winds increase
over the area sandwiched between the base of the trough and along
the northern periphery of the ridge. Fuels across this region remain
extremely receptive to fire spread owing to lack of recent
appreciable rainfall and subsequent ongoing moderate/severe drought
conditions.

Thereafter, guidance begins to diverge a bit regarding the evolution
of the upper-level trough/ridge pattern. Nevertheless, persistent
enhanced deep-layer flow atop receptive fuels coupled with dry to
very dry low-levels suggest continued chances for near Critical
conditions Day 5/Thursday and Day 6/Friday. Enhanced fire weather
conditions are forecast to finally diminish Day 7/Saturday as the
trough/ridge shift away from the area.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Thunderstorms are possible across portions of Arizona into far
southern Utah beginning Day 4/Wednesday through much of the work
week. Dry thunderstorms are possible across northern Arizona and
southern Utah, where fuels remain receptive to fire spread due to
the ongoing severe/extreme drought conditions. However, increasing
PWATs and uncertainties regarding coverage/location of any
thunderstorms precludes introducing probabilities for dry
thunderstorms at this time.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0247 PM CDT Sun Aug 03 2025

Valid 032000Z - 041200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF
THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Large to very large hail and severe wind gusts will be possible late
this afternoon through the evening over parts of the
central/southern High Plains.

...20z Update...
The previous forecast remains on track with no changes required.
Latest GOES imagery and surface observations show gradual clearing
and warming across the TX/OK Panhandles in the wake of prior
convection. An 18z AMA sounding sampled the eastern fringe of an
EML/steep mid-level lapse rates and 30-40 knot mid-level flow, but
showed substantial low/mid-level inhibition even when adjusting for
recent temperature trends. This continues to cast uncertainty
regarding storm coverage and intensity through the evening hours,
though recent CAM solutions maintain that at least a few cells
and/or clusters will migrate across the Slight risk area later
today/tonight. Further north, early signs of convective development
are noted across northwest KS into western NE/SD where stronger
heating should foster thunderstorm development, though weaker
forcing for ascent and deep-layer wind shear should limit overall
storm coverage and intensity. A cluster of thunderstorms that
recently moved through the Dallas/Fort-Worth metro area has shown
signs of weakening per GOES IR and MRMS imagery. This trend is
expected to continue as storms migrate into a more weakly sheared
environment downstream. See the previous discussion below for
additional details as well as MCD #1877 for short-term details
pertaining to the Pacific Northwest severe risk.

..Moore.. 08/03/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1129 AM CDT Sun Aug 03 2025/

...Southern Plains...
Late morning radar/satellite imagery shows a sub-severe, decaying
MCS over the TX-OK Red River Valley.  Incipient outflow and cloud
cover has cast considerable uncertainty on storm coverage late
today/tonight across the eastern portion of the outlook area in the
southern Plains.  It seems likely based on midday observational
trends that a reduction in severe probabilities is warranted across
parts of eastern OK into northeast TX.  The airmass sampled within
wake of the strongest influence of the cold pool by the 12 UTC Dodge
City, KS raob showed meager buoyancy.  As a result, a westward shift
of some of the severe probabilities was done for this outlook
update.

An upstream disturbance over northwest KS is forecast to move
southeast into central OK by late this evening.  Strong heating will
likely focus near the NM/TX north-south border into southeast CO. 
Models show isolated to widely scattered storm development late this
afternoon into the evening over the TX South Plains into southeast
CO.  Steep mid-level lapse rates coupled with veering/strengthening
winds with height will support a supercell risk.  Large to very
large hail is possible.  There is some indication in the models that
a cluster may evolve during the evening/overnight across parts of
west/northwest TX and a lingering hail/wind threat could continue
with this activity.  Models still show some possibility for elevated
storms farther east in the Red River Valley region during the
overnight.  Marginal hail/wind could accompany this activity.

...Central High Plains...
No change was made to this portion of the outlook and previous
forecast thinking supporting a marginal risk (level 1/5) seems
appropriate.  Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are possible later
this afternoon near a weak area of low pressure/lee trough. 
Moderate buoyancy will support a few vigorous updrafts, but vertical
shear is forecast to be weak, thereby limiting storm organization
and longevity.  Isolated hail and severe wind gusts are possible
with the stronger storms.

...Northwest...
A mid-level trough evident in morning water-vapor imagery west of
the CA/OR coast will continue migrating east into northern CA/OR by
tonight.  Adequate moisture and steep mid-level lapse rates coupled
with ascent will facilitate the development of widely scattered to
scattered thunderstorms this afternoon.  Modest deep-layer shear
will probably support some organization to convective outflow as
storms and especially outflow increase in coverage by early this
evening.  Evaporatively cooled downdrafts and outflow will
potentially yield a risk for severe gusts.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0150 PM CDT Sun Aug 03 2025

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF
SOUTHERN/CENTRAL/NORTHEAST UTAH...SOUTHWEST WYOMING...FAR NORTHWEST
COLORADO...FAR NORTHERN ARIZONA...AND FAR EASTERN NEVADA......

Primary modification with this forecast update was to expand the
Critical fire weather area farther northeast into portions of
northeast Utah, far northwestern Colorado, and southwest Wyoming
based on the latest high-resolution ensemble guidance. Several hours
of hot, extremely dry (single digit RH), and windy (sustained
surface winds exceeding 20 mph) conditions are expected across the
Critical fire weather area tomorrow (Monday) afternoon/evening.
Fuels across this region remain extremely receptive to fire spread
owing to lack of recent appreciable rainfall and subsequent ongoing
moderate/severe drought conditions. 

Locally elevated fire weather conditions are also possible along the
interior coastal ranges and foothills of southern/central California
and along the eastern slopes of the Sierra foothills. Though, at
this time, conditions appear to be too brief/spotty to introduce an
Elevated fire weather area. 

Otherwise, the forecast remains on-track with only minor adjustments
made. Please see the previous discussion below fore more information
on tomorrow's fire weather forecast.

..Elliott.. 08/03/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0204 AM CDT Sun Aug 03 2025/

...Synopsis...
A compact midlevel shortwave trough will advance east-northeastward
across the Intermountain West and northern Rockies on Monday.
Between the shortwave trough and a midlevel anticyclone over the
Southwest, moderate (30-40 kt) midlevel west-southwesterly flow will
overspread the Great Basin. 

...Great Basin...
Diurnal heating amid a warm/dry antecedent air mass will yield a
deeply mixed boundary layer across the Great Basin -- characterized
by widespread single-digit RH. Over southern/central UT, deep mixing
into the enhanced flow aloft will contribute to 20 mph sustained
west-southwesterly surface winds. These winds and low RH will lead
to critical fire-weather conditions, given receptive fuels.

...Dry Thunderstorms - Intermountain West...
Forcing for ascent preceding the midlevel trough will aid in
high-based thunderstorm development across the Intermountain West
and northern Rockies during the afternoon. Around 0.7 inch PW
(inverted-V sounding) and modest storm motions will favor mostly dry
thunderstorms across southeastern OR and southwestern ID. Given
limited precipitation and receptive fuels, lightning-induced
ignitions will be possible (along with strong outflow winds).

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ON TUESDAY
ACROSS THE DAKOTAS AND NORTHERN NEBRASKA...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms associated with a threat for isolated severe gusts and
hail will be possible across parts of the central and northern
Plains on Tuesday.

...Central/Northern Plains...
A large upper ridge will be centered over the Southwestern states on
Tuesday, with an upper trough rotating across the top of the ridge
over the Dakotas.  Scattered thunderstorm activity will likely be
ongoing across the western Dakotas at the start of the forecast
period, with precip and associated clouds weakening as they spread
eastward through the day.  Re-development of thunderstorms appears
likely in the wake of the morning storms in areas that can
destabilize, with a few strong/severe storms expected.  Given
multiple days of convection prior to Tuesday, confidence is low on
favored areas of severe threat.  Thus, will maintain a broad MRGL
risk at this time.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ON MONDAY ACROSS
PORTIONS OF THE NORTHERN ROCKIES INTO THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL HIGH
PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms with severe gusts and hail will be possible
on Monday from parts of the northern Rockies into the Dakotas and
central High Plains.

...MT...
Water vapor imagery shows a shortwave trough currently approaching
the OR/CA coast.  This feature will track northeastward and begin
affecting parts of ID/MT by Monday afternoon.  Steep low and mid
level lapse rates will result in sufficient CAPE for scattered
thunderstorm development over the mountains of central ID and
western MT by mid-afternoon.  These storms will become more numerous
and spread into central and eventually eastern MT through the
evening.  Favorably strong westerly winds aloft will promote a risk
of a few organized/rotating storms capable of damaging winds and
hail.  Cloud cover and the extent of afternoon destabilization over
central MT lends sufficient uncertainty to maintain only MRGL risk
at this time.

...High Plains...
The upper ridge will remain centered roughly over the central
Rockies, with widely scattered afternoon thunderstorms expected to
form near/east of the ridge axis from the Black Hills region
southward to the OK/TX Panhandles.  Any of one of these high-based
storm clusters could produce locally damaging wind gusts or hail,
but limited/uncertain coverage precludes an upgrade to SLGT for any
part of this corridor at this time.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1141 AM CDT Sun Aug 03 2025

Valid 031700Z - 041200Z

Primary adjustment with this forecast update was to expand the
Elevated fire weather area southwestward into portions of
southern/central California - including the interior foothills, the
Antelope Valley, and across southwest Santa Barbara County. Hot
(90-100F), dry (7-20%), and breezy onshore winds (sustained
west/north surface winds 15-20 mph) will promote several hours of
elevated fire weather conditions across the interior mountains and
Antelope Valley this afternoon and evening. Locally critical fire
weather conditions are also possible over the interior foothills,
where surface winds gusting between 25-40 mph are likely. Gusty
sundowner winds, with warm and dry conditions, should also promote a
few hours of elevated fire weather conditions across portions of
southwest Santa Barbara County - especially as wind gusts peak
during the late afternoon/evening. 

While locally elevated fire weather conditions may occur farther
north across the coastal ranges of central/northern California,
conditions appear to be too spotty/brief for an Elevated fire
weather area. Nevertheless, any fires in this area could exhibit
rapid growth/spread.  

Only minor changes were made to the Isolated Dry Thunderstorm area
over the Northwest based on the latest high-resolution guidance.
Strong-to-severe and erratic outflow winds in excess of 50 mph are
possible nearby any thunderstorms. Please see the SPC Day 1
Convective Outlook for more information on the severe weather threat
in the area. 

The remainder of the forecast remains on-track. Please see the
previous discussion below for more information on today's fire
weather forecast.

..Elliott.. 08/03/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0201 AM CDT Sun Aug 03 2025/

...Synopsis...
A midlevel trough will move eastward from the eastern Pacific into
the Northwest through the period. Within the base of the trough,
enhanced midlevel westerly flow will overspread a dry/deeply mixed
boundary layer across the Great Basin during the afternoon. This
will favor breezy/gusty surface winds (around 15-20 mph) amid
single-digit to lower teens RH, and given receptive fuels, elevated
fire-weather conditions are expected.

Preceding the trough, forcing for ascent will aid in afternoon
thunderstorm development across the northern Great Basin and
Intermountain West. Across parts of northern CA, southeastern OR,
and southwestern ID, inverted-V soundings (around 0.5-0.7 inch PW)
and quick storm motions will lead to mostly dry thunderstorms. These
storms will pose a risk of lightning-induced ignitions and
strong-severe outflow winds. For details on the severe-storm risk,
see the SPC Day 1 Convective Outlook. A mix of wet/dry thunderstorms
(with higher storms coverage) are also expected farther north across
east-central OR, though these storms should be accompanied by
measurable rainfall. Lightning-induced ignitions will still be
possible along the peripheries of rain cores.

Post-Tropical Cyclone Gil Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072025
500 AM HST Sun Aug 03 2025
 
Cool waters combined with a drier and more stable environment have 
taken their toll on Gil. The system has been devoid of deep 
convection overnight, with only an exposed swirl of low- to 
mid-level clouds remaining. The initial intensity is lowered to 45 
kt, based on a blend of the latest subjective Dvorak estimates from 
TAFB and SAB and objective estimates from UW-CIMSS. Given the cool 
waters, dry and stable air, and strengthening west-southwesterly 
shear, no new organized convection is expected. Therefore, this will 
be the final advisory on the system as it has become post-tropical. 
Gil is expected to dissipate around midweek as it opens into a 
trough northeast of the Hawaiian Islands.

The initial motion is estimated at 285/16 kt. The system is being 
steered by a low- to mid-level ridge to its north, and this general 
motion is expected to continue into tonight. A gradual decrease in 
forward speed is anticipated by Monday, followed by a turn toward 
the west as the shallow remnant low becomes steered by the low-level 
flow. The updated track forecast remains close to the previous 
advisory and continues to follow the tightly clustered guidance 
envelope.
 
For additional information on the post-tropical low please see High
Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS
header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0749 AM CDT Sun Aug 03 2025

Valid 031300Z - 041200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF
THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Large to very large hail and damaging winds will be possible this
afternoon and evening over parts of the central/southern High
Plains. Additional strong to severe storms are probable in the
Northwest during the afternoon.

...Southern Plains...
A decaying MCS is currently moving through the eastern TX Panhandle
and western OK. Expectation is for this system to continue
south-southeastward for the next several hours while gradually
weakening. Cool outflow and cloud cover associated with this system
will have an impact on the severe potential across the region today,
leading to above-average uncertainty regarding the overall
convective evolution. 

The overall environment from the TX Panhandle southward through the
South Plains and eastward into western OK and northwest TX will be
characterized by moderate northwesterly flow aloft, steep mid-level
lapse rates, and afternoon surface dewpoints ranging from the upper
50s to upper 60s. These conditions will support moderate to strong
buoyancy across much of the region, but areas under the influence of
the MCS's outflow and/or cloud cover will likely remain capped due
to limited/filtered diurnal heating. Current expectation is for the
TX South Plains and Permian Basin to remain south of the outflow,
allowing for strong heating and airmass destabilization. The outflow
is expected to act as the primary impetus for convective initiation
across the region this afternoon. Additional areas of low-level
convergence near a weak surface low over southeast NM and the weak
lee troughing extending from southeast CO across eastern NM could
result in a few storms as well. 

Low-level easterly/southeasterly flow veering to northwesterly in
the mid levels will result in moderate vertical shear, with the
overall wind profile quite supportive for large hail. As such, there
is a conditional risk for supercells capable of large to very large
hail. With time, some upscale growth into one or more linear
clusters with an increased risk for damaging gusts is possible.

...Central High Plains...
Early morning surface analysis placed a broad area of low pressure
from northeast CO into southwest SD. A low is expected develop
within this region by the early afternoon, and low-level convergence
in the vicinity of this low will likely result in thunderstorm
initiation. Late afternoon initiation is possible along the weak lee
trough across eastern WY as well. Moderate buoyancy will support
strong updrafts, but vertical shear is forecast to be weak, limiting
storm organization and longevity. Isolated hail and damaging gusts
are possible, particularly with any forward-propagating clusters
that can develop.

...Northwest...
Shortwave trough currently off the northern CA coast is forecast to
continue northeastward today, with lift associated with this system
impinging on the region by the early afternoon. Increasing mid-level
moisture (already apparent on the 12Z BOI sounding) will help
support moderate buoyancy and the development of scattered to
numerous thunderstorm this afternoon and evening. A belt of stronger
mid-level flow ahead of the shortwave will increase deep-layer shear
to 30-40 kt, supporting some storm organization. Steep lapse rates
with inverted-v thermodynamic profiles and the potential for
high-based semi-organized clusters will favor strong downdrafts
capable of occasional severe gusts with the stronger storms. Small
hail will also be possible with any more persistent clusters or weak
supercell structures despite the limited buoyancy.

Tropical Storm Gil Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072025
1100 PM HST Sat Aug 02 2025
 
Satellite imagery shows the convection north of the low-level 
circulation quickly diminishing as Gil continues west-northwestward 
over progressively cooler waters and into a more stable environment. 
A timely ASCAT pass revealed peak winds of around 45 kt in the 
northern semicircle. Subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates 
from TAFB and SAB range from 3.0/45 kt to 3.5/55 kt, which are 
slightly higher than objective satellite estimates. Based on a blend 
of these data and the ASCAT pass, the initial intensity is set at 50 
kt.
 
The initial motion is estimated at 290/16 kt. Gil is being steered
by a mid-level ridge to its north, and this general motion is
expected to continue Sunday. A gradual decrease in forward
speed is anticipated by Monday, followed by a turn toward the west
as the shallow remnant low becomes steered by the low-level flow. 
The updated track forecast remains close to the previous advisory 
and continues to follow the tightly clustered guidance envelope.
 
Continued movement over progressively cooler waters, intrusion of 
dry mid-level air, and the onset of increasing west-southwesterly 
shear should accelerate Gil’s weakening trend. Simulated satellite 
imagery from global models continues to suggest that Gil will lose 
its deep convection and become post-tropical late Sunday, or in 
about 24 hours. The system is then forecast to gradually spin down 
and dissipate within a few days, likely by day 4, as it opens into 
a trough northeast of the Hawaiian Islands.

Day 2 Convective Outlook CORR 1

0304 AM CDT Sun Aug 03 2025

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN ROCKIES INTO THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN PLAINS...

CORRECTED FOR FLIPPED LINE IN NORTHEAST

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms with severe gusts and hail will be possible
on Monday from parts of the northern Rockies into the Dakotas and
central High Plains.

...Northern Rockies/Northern High Plains...
A mid-level shortwave trough will move northeastward across the
Pacific Northwest on Monday. At the surface, a cold front will
advance eastward into the northern Rockies, as upslope easterly flow
remains over the northern High Plains. As surface temperatures warm,
thunderstorm development is expected during the afternoon near the
front, and in the higher terrain of the northern Rockies. These
storms will likely increase in coverage by early evening, moving
eastward into the northern High Plains. Surface dewpoints across
much central and eastern Montana are forecast to be in the upper 40s
and lower 50s F, which will contribute to the development of weak
instability by afternoon. Near the forecast pocket of instability,
forecast soundings suggest that 0-6 km shear will be in the 30 to 40
knot range. This, combined with steep low to mid-level lapse rates
near 8 C/km, will likely support an localized severe threat. The
stronger rotating cells could produce hail. Isolated severe gusts
will also be possible, mainly with short line segments that have
some organization.

...Central and Northern Plains...
A mid-level ridge will remain over the central Rockies on Monday, as
a trough remains nearly stationary across northern Minnesota. At the
surface, a north-to-south corridor of low-level moisture with
dewpoints in the 60s F, will be in place from central Kansas
northward into the eastern Dakotas. Moderate instability is forecast
to develop along the western edge of this moist airmass, from
western Nebraska into southwestern and central South Dakota. As
destabilization takes place during the day, isolated thunderstorm
development will be possible, mainly in areas where low-level
convergence becomes maximized. Across much of the region, 0-6 km
shear is forecast to be in the 35 to 45 knot range. This will
support an isolated threat for severe gusts. Hail will also be
possible in the central High Plains, where mid-level lapse rates are
forecast to be steep.
