Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0633 AM CST Wed Jan 08 2025

Valid 081300Z - 091200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected, but very isolated
thunderstorms are possible late tonight across parts of west Texas.

...West Texas...
A low-latitude mid/upper-level low will settle south-southeastward
over far northwest Mexico through tonight. Weak height falls will
begin to influence far west Texas late tonight, with modestly
increasing ascent atop a sub-freezing boundary layer. With cold
temperatures aloft and steepening mid-level lapse rates, weak
elevated instability based around 700 mb may be sufficient for
isolated lightning flashes late tonight, primarily after midnight.

Mesoscale Discussion 0008
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0756 AM CST Sun Jan 05 2025

Areas affected...southeast Kansas...much of southern Missouri...far
southern Illinois and western Kentucky

Concerning...Winter mixed precipitation 

Valid 051356Z - 051800Z

SUMMARY...A combination of snow, sleet, and freezing rain will
become mostly rain by late morning.

DISCUSSION...13Z surface analysis shows a 1004 mb surface low in
eastern Oklahoma with strong high pressure across the northern
Plains and Great Lakes region. Northeasterly surface winds resulting
from this pressure gradient continue to supply low-level arctic air
to areas north of the warm front from Kansas to the Lower Ohio
Valley. Strong 850mb warm air advection has resulted in a thermal
profile favorable for freezing rain across a broad region from
southeast Kansas and across much of southern Missouri early this
morning. The 0C 850mb line will continue to slowly shift north as
strong warm air advection occurs ahead of the surface cyclone. This
will result in snow changing to freezing rain in the next few hours
across parts of southern Illinois and western Kentucky. Areas across
southern Missouri where temperatures are currently near freezing
will likely rise above freezing this morning and bring an end to the
freezing rain threat. However, for much of the area currently
observing freezing rain, the threat will persist through at least
midday.

Mesoscale Discussion 0007
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0727 AM CST Sun Jan 05 2025

Areas affected...east-central Missouri...parts of southern
Illinois...southern Indiana...and parts of central Kentucky.

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 051327Z - 051730Z

SUMMARY...1+ inch per hour snowfall rates are expected this morning.

DISCUSSION...Light to  moderate snowfall has developed within a
swath from central Missouri to central Kentucky this morning with a
few heavy snow observations appearing recently in southern Illinois
and southern Indiana. Expect moderate to heavy snow in a relatively
narrow corridor north of the freezing rain from east-central
Missouri to parts of central Kentucky. In addition to the radar
depiction and surface observations indicating heavy snow, the 12Z
HRRR shows a swath of significant accumulation between 13Z and 17Z.
By midday much of this area will switch to freezing rain with the
heavy snow swath shifted farther north during the afternoon as warm
air advection strengthens ahead of the approaching surface low.

Mesoscale Discussion 0006
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0651 AM CST Sun Jan 05 2025

Areas affected...northeast Kansas into west-central Missouri

Concerning...Blizzard 

Valid 051251Z - 051715Z

SUMMARY...Snowfall rates and winds are increasing. Blizzard
conditions will develop this morning.

DISCUSSION...Light to moderate snow is now being observed across
most of northeast Kansas and west-central Missouri. Expect further
increase in snowfall intensity through the morning as the
mid-latitude cyclone continues to organize. Snowfall rates over 2
inches per hour are possible with 40 to 50% probabilities indicated
by the HREF. In addition, winds are expected to increase further as
strong high pressure builds into the northern Plains. The resulting
pressure gradient will lead to sustained winds of 25 to 30 mph and
gusts over 40 mph for much of the day. This will result in
significant blowing and drifting and visibility restrictions.
Blizzard/near-blizzard conditions are likely along the I-70 corridor
from central Kansas to west-central Missouri through most of the day
today.

Mesoscale Discussion 0005
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0439 AM CST Sun Jan 05 2025

Areas affected...portions of southwest and south-central Kansas.

Concerning...Blizzard 

Valid 051039Z - 051545Z

SUMMARY...Blizzard conditions developing.

DISCUSSION...A deformation band has started to organize across
southwest Kansas and the OK/northern TX Panhandles. As this rotates
eastward, heavy snow with 1+ inch per hour rates are expected. In
addition, strong winds are already present (sustained 31 mph at KGBD
on the 956Z observation) and are expected to strengthen further over
the next 3 to 6 hours. Temperatures are in the mid teens which
should result in less dense snow and accentuate visibility
reductions amid strong winds. This will likely result in some
blizzard conditions across parts of southwest and south-central
Kansas through the morning. 

Freezing rain is falling across eastern portions of the MD area
where warmer mid-level air has advected west to the north of the
surface low. However, expect these areas to transition to snow after
13-14Z once the surface low moves farther east.

## SPC Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

date: 2025-01-05, from: NOAA Weather Forecasts

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/fire_wx/fwdy2.html"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/fire_wx/day2fireotlk.gif" border="1" alt="Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="815" height="555" align="center" /></a><pre>
Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0140 AM CST Sun Jan 05 2025

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
With a fairly expansive trough across much of the U.S. on Monday,
fire weather concerns are expected to be minimal on account of
cool/cold conditions and higher RH values. There will be modest
increase in offshore winds in southern California towards Tuesday
morning, but winds and RH still appear too marginal for more than a
locally elevated threat.
