## Six Degrees of a Spec Sale

date: 2025-01-14, from: Final Draft blog

<div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"> 
 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/six-degrees-of-a-spec-sale" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/Filmmaker%20Writing.png" alt="Six Degrees of a Spec Sale" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<p>If you’re a beginner writer and you’ve read about a new “spec sale” in the trades, you might not know what all the fuss is about.&nbsp;<br><br>A spec sale is when <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/what-is-a-spec-script">a spec script</a> has been purchased by a studio or production company (a spec script being an original screenplay that you’ve written on your own and not on assignment). &nbsp;<br><br>Spec sales have always piqued the imagination of aspiring screenwriters and people working in the film business, especially in a marketplace that’s increasingly dependent on established IPs (intellectual properties). Just the idea that someone came up with <span style="font-style: italic;">an original idea for a movie</span> and then <span style="font-style: italic;">sold it</span> almost seems like a fantastical feat, and the bigger the sale, the more wonder it inspires.&nbsp;<br><br>Big spec sales aren’t a daily event, and when they do happen, everyone gets very excited about the news. It can create a long-lasting career for a screenwriter if they have good representation and make the most of their newfound “heat” (i.e. industry buzz).&nbsp;<br><br>Sometimes the spec script you sold doesn’t even have to end up getting produced in order for it to create a career for you. I broke into the film business with <a href="https://variety.com/2008/film/markets-festivals/carrey-reitman-team-for-pierre-1117981909/">a big spec sale</a> that got a lot of attention for several years. In fact, that script <span style="font-style: italic;">still</span> gets brought up to me whenever I meet someone who was working in the industry back when we sold it. This proves that spec sales not only pique the imagination, stir excitement and create a buzz: they stick in the minds of people for years to come.<br><br>Every screenwriter’s journey is going to be different, but for me there were six degrees to my spec sale.</p>

<p>Despite what Robert Frost may have thought, a lot of SFF writers really do love a wall. Walled and isolated cities, redoubts, or keeps (to use the term favored by <strong>The Science Fiction Encyclopedia</strong>) have proved useful to SFF for exploring everything from overpopulation to alien invasions to environmental catastrophe to those pesky tech  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/01/we-lived-on-the-horizon-by-erika-swyler-review-by-gary-k-wolfe/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Mechanize My Hands to War by Erin K. Wagner : Review by Paul Di Filippo

date: 2025-01-13, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Mechanize My Hands to War</strong>, Erin K. Wagner (DAW 978-0756419349, hardcover, 320pp, $28.00) December 2024</p>
<p>Erin Wagner’s debut novel is a highly sophisticated tale, constructed in clever fashion, which revolves around the classic motif of human versus nonhuman, specifically man against android. It does not necessarily expand the frontiers of this theme—Wagner’s sociological and technological speculations about androids and their uses hew pretty closely to the standard SF textbook,  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/01/mechanize-my-hands-to-war-by-erin-k-wagner-review-by-paul-di-filippo/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

<p><strong>The Spellshop</strong>, Sarah Beth Durst (Bramble 978-1-250-33397-1, $29.88, 384pp, hc) July 2024.</p>
<p>Author Sarah Beth Durst notes in her Acknowl­edgements to <strong>The Spellshop </strong>that writing her novel was sparked by hot chocolate and raspberry jam and a desire for “a book that felt like a warm hug.” (I get that sentiment because boy howdy, 2024 has been some kind of tough for a lot of us.)
