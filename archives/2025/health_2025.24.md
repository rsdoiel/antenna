## Novel potential biomarkers for predicting childhood caries via metagenomic analysis

date: 2025-06-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundDental caries is a prevalent global health issue, particularly among children, with significant oral and overall health implications. The oral microbiome is considered a critical factor in caries development, with various microbial species implicated in the disease process.ObjectivesThis study aims to explore the changes and interactions of oral microbiota in childhood caries using metagenomic analysis, and identify potential biomarkers for early caries detection and treatment.MethodsSaliva samples were collected from 241 children aged 6 to 9 years, categorized into caries-free (CF), low-caries (CL), and caries-severe (CS) groups. Metagenomic sequencing was performed to analyze the oral microbiome, followed by a series of statistical and functional analyses to characterize microbial diversity and function.ResultsThe study revealed significant differences in the microbial community composition among the groups, with the CS group exhibiting higher alpha and beta diversity than that of the CF group. Numerous unclassified microorganisms, such as Campylobacter SGB19347 and Catonella SGB4501, are intimately linked to dental caries and display intricate interaction networks, suggesting the potential formation of a distinct ecological network. In functional assessment, we identified a possible link between pectin and caries, suggesting that microorganisms that produce pectinase enzymes might play a role in the advancement of severe dental caries. Additionally, we identified 16 species as the best marker for severe dental caries, achieving an impressive AUC of 0.91.ConclusionThe role of microbiota in dental caries is multifaceted, involving a complex interplay of microbial species and functions. Our findings enhance the understanding of the microbial basis of dental caries and offer potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets. The predictive capacity of the identified biomarkers warrants further investigation for early caries detection and intervention.Clinical SignificanceThe identification of novel biomarkers through metagenomic analysis enables early detection and targeted intervention for childhood caries, potentially transforming children dental care and significantly improving long-term oral health outcomes.

## A comparative analysis of clinical outcomes in hematological patients afflicted with bacteremia attributable to carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae versus Escherichia coli

date: 2025-06-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionCarbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) bloodstream infections (BSI) represent a frequent and grave complication among hematological patients, whose prevailing culprits are Carbapenem-Resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) and Escherichia coli bacteremia (EC). Nevertheless, there is a paucity of studies that have undertaken a comparative analysis of clinical outcomes in patients afflicted with CRKP and EC.MethodsThis study was conducted with the aim of identifying the microbiological and clinical characteristics of hematological patients suffering from bacteremia caused by CRKP and CREC.ResultsThe cohort included 90 patients with equal proportions of CRKP BSI and CREC BSI from 2017 to 2022. Among the tested CRE strains (n = 45) for carbapenemase (CP) genes, the KPC gene was most commonly found in CP-CRKP isolates (12/21), while the NDM gene predominated among CP-CREC strains (18/24). A comparison of drug susceptibility showed that CREC was significantly more susceptible to tigecycline than CRKP (97.73% vs. 64.86%, P = 0.018). Patients treated with tigecycline-based therapy had a higher survival rate in the CREC group (18/24,75%) compared to the CRKP group (8/14,57.1%). The CRKP group had a significantly lower rate of prior cephalosporin use within 30 days compared to the CREC group (27% vs. 49%, P = 0.03) and a higher incidence of multi-site infections before BSI (44% vs. 8.9%, P<0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that BSI caused by CRKP was an independent risk factor for survival (P = 0.029), while CAZ-AVI-based therapy emerged as an independent factor improving patient prognosis (P =0.013).ConclusionsOur results found that bacteremia instigated by CRKP was associated with a less favorable prognosis when compared to cases induced by CREC. Moreover, treatment regimens incorporating CAZ-AVI have the potential to enhance the prognosis of patients grappling with CRE BSI.

## Extraction, purification, biological effects and applications of acrosin: a review

date: 2025-06-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Acrosin is a proteolytic enzyme in the sperm acrosome that can stimulate sperm to penetrate the zona pellucida, causing the fertilization of the oocyte. Its activity is a crucial indicator of the sperm’s fertilization ability, which is critical in mammalian and human reproduction. However, there exists a lack of a comprehensive review of acrosin. In this study, we compared the extraction methods of acrosin, including acid extraction, buffer extraction, and saline extraction. The main methods for purifying acrosin, such as ammonium sulfate precipitation, ultrafiltration, dialysis, gel filtration chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, and affinity chromatography, are reviewed. In addition, a detailed overview of the biological functions, inhibitors and applications of acrosin are outlined. This study provides methods for the extraction and purification of acrosin and some theoretical basis for the study of its properties. This provides a reference for further research on acrosin.

## Treatment of bacterial biothreat agents with a novel purified bioactive lactoferrin affects both growth and biofilm formation

date: 2025-06-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Lactoferrin is known to exhibit broad spectrum activity against a multitude of bacteria, fungi, and viruses due to its multi-functional mode of action. Recently, Lactea Therapeutics and its affiliates have developed a novel, patent-pending technology to purify naturally derived bovine lactoferrin (Lactea Lf) for use as a medical countermeasure that was not previously available. To assess the efficacy of Lactea Lf against biothreat pathogens, we performed biofilm inhibition assays and generated dose-response curves against Burkholderia pseudomallei, Burkholderia mallei, and Francisella tularensis for proof-of-principle studies. Here, we show that Lactea Lf can significantly inhibit biofilm and decrease the overall growth in a dose dependent manner for all Burkholderia species tested. Of note, Lactea Lf was found to completely inhibit biofilm formation by virulent B. pseudomallei without observing complete growth inhibition. The growth of F. tularensis was also significantly inhibited when cultured in the presence of Lactea Lf and appeared more sensitive to treatment when compared to B. pseudomallei. Based on these results, a pneumonic infection model using the F. tularensis LVS strain was performed prophylactically administering Lactea Lf and continuing treatment post challenge. No protection was observed in this model which prompted biodistribution studies using fluorescent tagged Lactea Lf. These experiments revealed that therapeutic material was mainly confined to the NALT region following intranasal delivery and then quickly dispersed or inactivated suggesting that future formulation and delivery method could be addressed to increase in vivo treatment efficacy. Taken together, these data support that Lactea Lf is a potentially new candidate for further studies as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial medical countermeasure with efficacy against several high priority biodefense-related bacterial pathogens.

## Therapeutic interventions aimed at cccDNA: unveiling mechanisms and evaluating the potency of natural products

date: 2025-06-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection persists as a formidable global health predicament, imposing a substantial burden on public health. It not only elevates the risk of cirrhosis but also significantly heightens the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), thereby exacerbating the complexity of managing this disease. Central to the intractability of chronic hepatitis B is the tenacious persistence of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) within the nuclei of infected hepatocytes. This cccDNA serves as a stable transcriptional template, continuously fueling the production of viral components and rendering the virus refractory to current antiviral interventions.​ The attainment of a definitive cure for HBV infection hinges upon the development of innovative antiviral strategies that can precisely and effectively target and eliminate cccDNA from the infected liver cells. In this regard, natural products have emerged as a promising source of potential therapeutics. This comprehensive review delves into the natural products that have shown promise in specifically targeting cccDNA. It meticulously elucidates the intricate molecular mechanisms through which these natural compounds modulate cccDNA activity, such as interfering with cccDNA formation, disrupting its epigenetic regulation, or inhibiting its transcriptional output. Developing innovative strategies to target and eliminate cccDNA is crucial for curing HBV infection, and natural products hold great promise. This review details several natural products with cccDNA-targeting potential, supported by clear mechanisms and data. Dehydrocheilanthifolin (DHCH) from Corydalis saxicola inhibits HBsAg and HBeAg secretion in HepG2.2.15 cells. It may disrupt viral processes like pgRNA packaging or DNA polymerase activity, with IC50 values for reducing extracellular, intracellular DNA, and cccDNA at 15.08 μM, 7.62 μM, and 8.25 μM respectively. Methyl helicterate from Helicteres angustifolia decreases HBsAg, HBeAg, HBV DNA, and cccDNA in HepG2.2.15 cells. 15.8 μM reduces intracellular cccDNA. Curcumin from turmeric reduces viral load and cccDNA in d-imHCs; 30µM halves cccDNA levels. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) from green tea hinders viral transcription and replication. 22.9μg/ml EGCG lowers cccDNA by about 60%. Asiaticoside from Hydrocotyle sibthorpioides inhibits HBsAg, HBeAg, and cccDNA in HepG2.2.15 cells. Notably, despite extensive research, no natural product has yet obtained clinical validation for cccDNA clearance, highlighting the significant translational gap between pre-clinical research and clinical application. By elucidating these molecular mechanisms, this review aims to contribute to the development of HBV-targeted therapies, offering valuable insights for designing novel therapeutic agents and optimizing existing treatment regimens, ultimately advancing the quest for an effective cure for HBV infection.

## Transcriptional profiling of Chlamydia trachomatis and its host in an ex vivo endocervical primary cell culture system using dual RNA sequencing

date: 2025-06-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) is an obligate intracellular bacterium that causes significant ocular and urogenital morbidity worldwide. Understanding host-pathogen interactions is challenging but dual RNA sequencing offers simultaneous transcriptome data for comprehensive interrogations into these interactions. While transcriptional profiling of both Ct and host-derived immortalized cells has been performed, this study used dual RNA sequencing to examine host-pathogen interactions in ex vivo human primary endocervical stromal cells infected with Ct strain E/Bour. At 1-hour post-infection (1hpi), 168 differentially expressed host genes (DEGs) were identified, 40% of which were non-coding RNAs, novel proteins, or pseudogenes. Pathway analysis revealed no significant enrichment at this stage, indicating a quiescent host response. At 24hpi, 212 DEGs were identified, with strong upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes and activation of the cGAS-STING and RLR pathways, despite the absence of detectable type I interferons. Pro-inflammatory and leukocyte recruitment genes were also highly expressed, suggesting an immunoreactive phenotype at this later stage. Ct transcriptomics identified 331 early and 903 mid-infection genes. Inclusion-membrane genes peaked at 1hpi, while hemolysin-like and polymorphic membrane protein genes were upregulated at 24hpi. Enrichment analysis identified pathways related to catalytic activity, host modulation, and bacterial survival. This study demonstrates distinct temporal dynamics in Ct-host interactions, including early host immune quiescence and robust mid-infection activation of innate immunity in contradistinction to previous host and Ct findings in immortalized cell lines. The findings emphasize the utility of ex vivo human primary cell culture for investigating Ct pathogenesis using clinically relevant Ct strains and provide a foundation for future exploration of uncharacterized genes and pathways critical to Ct infection.

## A combination of recombinase polymerase amplification with CRISPR technology rapidly detects goose parvovirus with high accuracy and sensitivity

date: 2025-06-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundGoose parvovirus (GPV) poses a significant threat to the waterfowl industry, necessitating reliable detection methods. However, conventional techniques are often time-consuming, equipment-dependent, or lack sufficient sensitivity for detecting early-stage infection. In contrast, emerging CRISPR/Cas12a-based systems offer a promising alternative for rapid, sensitive, and on-site diagnostics.MethodsWe developed and optimized a recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA)-CRISPR/Cas12a assay targeting the conserved VP3 gene of GPV. The analytical and diagnostic performance of this assay was rigorously validated using plasmid standards and clinical specimens from both experimentally infected and field-collected ducklings.ResultsOur developed assay combines RPA with CRISPR/Cas12a technology for rapid GPV nucleic acids detection. This method achieves a detection limit of 10 copies/μL of the VP3 gene within one hour, demonstrating high sensitivity and rapid turnaround. The assay exhibited exceptional specificity, with no cross-reactivity against other waterfowl viruses, and showed robust reproducibility, with intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation consistently below 5.0%. Clinical validation using 42 field samples confirmed a diagnostic sensitivity of 100% and 95.5% specificity, showing superior performance to real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) in both metrics. Furthermore, the assay supports flexible visual readouts using portable blue light transilluminators, facilitating on-site interpretation.ConclusionsThis study established a highly field-deployable RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a assay for rapid, visual detection of GPV with outstanding sensitivity and specificity. Its capability for instrument-free on-site diagnosis via blue light transillumination makes this approach particularly promising for resource-limited settings.

## Overcoming dengue vaccine challenges through next-generation virus-like particle immunization strategies

date: 2025-06-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Dengue fever represents an escalating global health threat, as unprecedented outbreaks expose significant limitations of current vaccine strategies. Conventional live-attenuated dengue vaccines, while partially efficacious, face critical hurdles including serotype imbalances and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). This review critically assesses virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines as a promising alternative, providing safer, non-replicating platforms that mimic viral structure without risks associated with live replication. Technological advancements in recombinant expression systems have improved VLP yield, stability, and scalability, addressing deployment obstacles. Recent preclinical studies demonstrate that tetravalent dengue VLP vaccines induce balanced neutralizing antibodies across all serotypes, effectively circumventing ADE in animal models. These findings suggest superior safety and robust immune responses, potentially surpassing live-attenuated and mRNA-based vaccines. We emphasize advancements in VLP vaccine technology, including novel tetravalent particle designs engineered to exclude ADE-related immunopathogenic components (prM protein), innovative stability-enhancing formulation techniques, and cost-effective recombinant production platforms (yeast and plant-based systems). Additionally, this review proposes novel deployment strategies, such as regional manufacturing hubs, standardized modular VLP platforms, adaptive clinical trial frameworks leveraging surrogate endpoints, and strengthened international coordination for equitable vaccine distribution. Integrating these scientific innovations and practical strategies positions dengue VLP vaccines as pivotal next-generation solutions for global dengue prevention.

## Exopolysaccharide production by seven basidiomycetous fungi and their antioxidant and immunomodulatory activities against Salmonella infection

date: 2025-06-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The discovering new fungal strains, optimal production, and understanding the fundamental aspects of exopolysaccharides (EPs) are important to utilize them in an industrial, medical, and biotechnological perspective. In this study, the optimal conditions for EP production from seven basidiomycetous fungal strains were investigated. The results indicated that six fungal species, Schizophyllum commune, Ganoderma fornicatum, G. williamsianum, Earliella scabrosa, Favolus tenuiculus, and Pycnoporus sanguineus, produced the highest EP yield in potato dextrose broth. The highest yield of EPs produced by Lentinus sajor-caju was obtained in mushroom complete medium broth. It was found that a pH value between 6 and 8 in the liquid culture media promoted EP production. The highest EP yield was obtained for 10 to 14 days which depends on fungal strain. Interestingly, this present study revealed the first report of EP production from G. fornicatum, G. williamsianum, E. scabrosa, F. tenuiculus, and P. sanguineus, including the genera Earliella and Favolus. The obtained crude EPs showed water solubilization ability. The Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy spectra exhibited typical carbohydrate patterns in all crude EPs. Monosaccharide composition analysis revealed that the crude EPs were primarily composed of glucose, followed by fructose, allose, and allulose, with variations depending on the fungal strain. Additionally, crude EPs demonstrated positive antioxidant potential. Finally, we determined the anti-Salmonella and immunomodulatory effects of crude EPs from S. commune, G. fornicatum, and L. sajor-caju due to their high EP yield. Pretreatment of mouse macrophages with these fungal EPs enhanced the phagocytic killing activity of Salmonella-infected macrophages. Upregulations of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in macrophages were detected in the fungal EPs-treated groups. Our study reported the optimizing conditions for EP production from several strains of Basidiomycetous fungi and their potential as an alternative to antibiotics for multidrug-resistant Salmonella infection.

## The effects of cervical cerclage on the vaginal microbiota and its metabolites in pregnant women

date: 2025-06-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Cervical cerclage is widely used to reduce the risk of preterm birth in pregnant women. The effects of cervical cerclage on the vaginal microbiota and its metabolites are not fully clear. The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of cervical cerclage on the vaginal microbiota and its metabolites. Our results showed that the clinical characteristics [white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocytes, platelet, NLR, PLR, SII, SIRI, and C-reactive protein (CRP)] and α-diversity (Observed, Shannon, Chao1, and Simpson indexes) of the vaginal microbiota were not altered during pregnancy after cervical cerclage. 16S rRNA gene sequencing found that the relative abundance of Muribaculaceae and Blautia was significantly increased in the post-cerclage group compared with the pre-cerclage group, but the relative abundance of Sneathia was significantly reduced. In addition, the volcano plot revealed that a total of 19 metabolites [including alpha-hydroxyalprazolam, LPE (18:1(9Z)/0:0), PS(16:0/15:0), N-acetylhistamine, carnitine, pseudouridine, and allopregnanolone] were significantly changed during pregnancy after cervical cerclage. Pathway analysis based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database showed that the changes in the vaginal microbiota and its metabolites mainly involved purine metabolism and amino acid metabolism. The alteration in the vaginal microbiota and its metabolites induced by cervical cerclage is associated with the therapeutic efficacy of cervical cerclage. Further studies are needed to explore how the vaginal microbiota affects the outcomes of pregnancy.

## Oral bacterial community dynamics during induction of gingival inflammation

date: 2025-06-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe human oral cavity is a complex and dynamic microbial ecosystem integral to oral and overall health. While the specific roles of microbial communities in health and disease are not fully understood, dysbiosis of the oral microbiota is, along with inadequate immune fitness, recognized as a key factor driving the onset of inflammatory conditions such as gingivitis. Gingivitis, an early and reversible stage of periodontal disease, involves shifts in microbial composition and diversity. This study aimed to investigate the compositional dynamics of the oral microbiota during the early stages of gingival inflammation, focusing on changes across multiple oral niches and their relationship to clinical outcomes.MethodsWe conducted an experimental gingivitis intervention study with 41 healthy volunteers. After a two-week baseline period, participants refrained from oral hygiene for two weeks to induce gingivitis, followed by a one-week resolution phase with resumed oral hygiene. Clinical parameters, including plaque and bleeding scores, were monitored at seven time points. Samples from saliva and five oral niches (tongue, keratinized gingiva, supragingival, subgingival, and interproximal dental plaque) were collected and analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Multivariate statistical analyses were applied to evaluate microbial dynamics and their associations with clinical outcomes.ResultsThe study revealed pronounced microbial changes, particularly in supragingival plaque, where Leptotrichia and Prevotella increased while Streptococcus decreased. Alpha diversity significantly increased in supragingival plaque, tongue, and saliva during gingivitis induction, highlighting shifts in microbial complexity. Clinical correlations indicated that plaque presence was primarily associated with bacterial load, while gingival bleeding was driven by compositional changes in supragingival plaque and tongue biofilms. These findings suggest that microbial density and composition independently contribute to gingivitis markers.ConclusionThis study concludes that occurrence of dental plaque and gingival bleeding are independent clinical parameters, linked to bacterial load and composition, respectively. Interactions between multiple niches, especially the tongue, influence clinical outcomes, highlighting a complex, nonlinear dynamic behavior in the oral microbiota. These findings suggest intricate ecological interactions that may approach tipping points, advancing understanding of microbial dynamics during gingival inflammation and informing future strategies for managing gingivitis.
