Microsoft’s AI Red Team just published
“<a href="https://airedteamwhitepapers.blob.core.windows.net/lessonswhitepaper/MS_AIRT_Lessons_eBook.pdf">Lessons
from<br /> Red Teaming 100 Generative AI Products</a>.” Their
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/01/13/3-takeaways-from-red-teaming-100-generative-ai-products/">blog
post</a> lists “three takeaways,” but the eight lessons in the report
itself are more useful:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
Understand what the system can do and where it is applied.
</li>
<li>
You don’t have to compute gradients to break an AI system.
</li>
<li>
AI red teaming is not safety benchmarking.
</li>
<li>
Automation can help cover more of the risk landscape.
</li>
<li>
The human element of AI red teaming is crucial.
</li>
<li>
Responsible AI harms are pervasive but difficult to measure.
</li>
<li>
LLMs amplify existing security risks and introduce new ones…

possibly was a bit hasty in
<a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/04.html#a204729">declaring the

from the courts telling Musk to stop, and so far Trump has been obeying
those, so there’s some hope when that happens he’ll order Musk to stop,
and then we’ll find out who the boss is and how our new post-coup
reality works. The shock of Trump’s
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9w5q8qn59yo">plan for
Gaza</a>, announced yesterday may get even the most “loyal” Repubs in
Congress to think again about what hell they hath wrought on they
country they all grew up in. I have some faith that American values are
installed in their personal operating systems, somewhere in there is the
remnant of the ideals of the Constitution. So I might have missed the
mark, I hope I did. Meanwhile I wonder if Musk’s wonderboys have managed
to penetrate the military, and if they’re planning on giving them orders
about how to restrain the anti-Musk protests that are starting to break
out around the country. Oh mama we live in

<h2 id="borgbackup-for-the-laptop-and-the-server">2025-01-31 BorgBackup
for the laptop and the server</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-01-31-borgbackup-for-the-laptop-and-the-server">
2025-01-31 BorgBackup for the laptop and the server
</h1>
<p>
A few days ago I mentioned the
<a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-01-27-rsync-sqlite">rsync-based
backup script</a> I use to copy data from the server to the laptop.
</p>
<p>
The backup script that makes backups of my laptop (including the backup
from the server) to external disks is different, however.
</p>
<p>
My actual backup uses external disks. I have two of them. One of them is
always at the office. Every now and then (not often enough!) I make a
backup to the external disk I have at hand and then I carry it to the
office and bring the other one back. That is, the laptop and the two
external disks are never in the same location.
</p>
<p>
The two external disks I use are “known backup disks”. When I plug them
in, BorgBackup immediately starts making a backup. I discussed this
setup <a href="2017-12-24_Borg_Backup">back in 2017</a>.
</p>
<p>
I’m just going to repost the stuff and I don’t think there have been any
significant changes.
</p>
<p>
Run commands and create files as root.
</p>
<p>
Either use <code>sudo</code> for every command you run, or use
<code>sudo su</code> once and do everything as root. No matter how you
do it, the danger zone awaits!
</p>
<h2 id="mnt-backup">
<code>/mnt/backup</code>
</h2>
<p>
Create the mount point on the laptop:
</p>
<pre><code>mkdir /mnt/backup
</code></pre>
<h2 id="etc-fstab">
<code>/etc/fstab</code>
</h2>
<p>
Any disk labeled “Backup” will be mounted as <code>/mnt/backup</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>LABEL=Backup /mnt/backup auto nosuid,nodev,nofail,noauto,x-gvfs-show 0 0
</code></pre>
<h2 id="etc-backups-40-backup-rules">
<code>/etc/backups/40-backup.rules</code>
</h2>
<p>
Install a symlink to this file:
</p>
<pre><code>ln -s /etc/backups/40-backup.rules \
      /etc/udev/rules.d/40-backup.rules
</code></pre>
<p>
The file content:
</p>
<pre><code>ACTION==&quot;add&quot;, SUBSYSTEM==&quot;bdi&quot;, DEVPATH==&quot;/devices/virtual/bdi/*&quot;, TAG+=&quot;systemd&quot;, ENV{SYSTEMD_WANTS}=&quot;automatic-backup.service&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>
This makes sure that the service <code>automatic-backup</code> starts
whenever an external disk gets plugged into the laptop.
</p>
<h2 id="etc-backups-automatic-backup-service">
<code>/etc/backups/automatic-backup.service</code>
</h2>
<p>
Install a symlink to this file:
</p>
<pre><code>ln -s /etc/backups/automatic-backup.service \
      /etc/systemd/system/automatic-backup.service
</code></pre>
<p>
The service does nothing except start the <code>run.sh</code> shell
script.
</p>
<pre><code>[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/etc/backups/run.sh
</code></pre>
<h2 id="etc-backups-backup-disks">
<code>/etc/backups/backup.disks</code>
</h2>
<p>
The <code>run.sh</code> below runs for every external disk plugged in.
It’s important to only make backups to known backup disks, however.
</p>
<p>
The known backup disks are identified by their <code>uuid</code> in the
<code>backup.disks</code> file.
</p>
<p>
To list the disk labels and their <code>uuid</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>lsblk -o+uuid,label
</code></pre>
<p>
Add the <code>uuid</code> to the <code>/etc/backups/backup.disks</code>
file.
</p>
<p>
This is the content of the file identifying my backup disks, for
example:
</p>
<pre><code># generate using: lsblk -o+uuid,label
7c478832-5d7f-43d3-9b79-20cfc67fb0e6
bb1c034e-dd21-48e7-a496-1b95685a094d
156cf4df-aa58-421e-b3d0-583fe6fdff4a
</code></pre>
<p>
If you create your copy of the file, your uuids will be different!
</p>
<p>
When you run <code>lsblk -o+uuid,label</code> you’ll also see the device
itself. In my case, that’s <code>/dev/sdb</code>. Create a BorgBackup
repository on the new disk, mount it, create the directory and
initialize the repository.
</p>
<p>
When initializing the repository, you’re asked for a passphrase. You
will need it for the <code>run.sh</code> script.
</p>
<pre><code>mount /dev/sdb /mnt/backup
mkdir /mnt/backup/borg-backups
borg init --encryption=repokey --progress /mnt/backup/borg-backups/backup.borg
umount /mnt/backup
</code></pre>
<p>
Make sure the disk has the correct label! You can do this from the
command-line but I used
<a href="https://apps.gnome.org/en/DiskUtility/">Disks</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="etc-backups-run-sh">
<code>/etc/backups/run.sh</code>
</h2>
<p>
Now we’re ready for the actual script. It checks whether a known backup
disk is mounted under <code>/mnt/backup</code> and if so, it creates a
new archive in the repository.
</p>
<p>
Don’t forget to search for <code>BORG_PASSPHRASE</code> and change it to
whatever you used when you ran <code>borg init</code> above!
</p>
<p>
Hide the passphrase from everybody else and to make it executable:
</p>
<pre><code>chmod 0700 run.sh
</code></pre>
<p>
This the content of the shell script:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash -ue

# The udev rule is not terribly accurate and may trigger our service before
# the kernel has finished probing partitions. Sleep for a bit to ensure
# the kernel is done.

</h2>
<p>
Check the log while the backup is being written:
</p>
<pre><code>journalctl --follow --unit automatic-backup

<p>
Make sure the backup disk is identified correctly and look at the sizes
of the archives. If they’re too small, check whether the archives
contain the right files!

<strong>2025-02-04</strong>. A reader sent me an email saying: “you may
want to call <code>borg compact</code> after <code>borg prune</code> in
order to actually free up the disk space corresponding to the pruned
archives. Otherwise your backup repo will keep growing in size.”
</p>
<p>
Good point. I think in my case it doesn’t matter because I don’t use the
disk space for anything else (and surely Borg will reuse it). But who
knows. Your situation might be different.

coup is over</a>. This time, unlike the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack">last
time</a> it was tried, it worked. We’re in the post-coup world now. He
showed us exactly what he would do if he could and we somehow
collectively acted as if he hadn’t shown us. Sanewashing was just the
tip of the iceberg, you can’t blame it on the press, we didn’t demand
they get their shit together, we didn’t try to change the subject so
they’d have to tell the real story. We had a lot of tools available to
us that we didn’t use because we are lazy and selfish. BTW, if you want
to follow the power, don’t look at what governments do, look at what the
other oligarchs do. Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, etc.</p>

with both AltStore and Hot Tub knows this, but they also know that
framing it as though notarization conveys approval is a good way to get

warning. As easily as Musk can turn off government websites, he can turn
off our sites. He could turn off all .com or .org sites. He’ll probably
do it just that way. Only one domain will work in the future, x.com.
Goodbye Google, Amazon, your drug store. Bubye. Not sure if moving your
DNS to Europe or Asia will make a difference. He’s taking advantage of
centralization, and will try to make it more centralized. Totally
centralized. A journalist couldn’t report this, because what proof do I
have? It’s because there’s a pattern here. And it’s pretty obvious the
tools he’s using.</p>

<p>I was just setting up an account for another Feed Reader experiment
on Bluesky and found that they have a
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Suggested+User+List%22">Suggested
User List</a> that recommended the usual people who get in the way of
telling the story that’s really happening. I had a sinking feeling in my
stomach, really felt it. We went through this with Twitter, it created
influencers based on how loyal they were to the people who run Twitter,
people who overlooked the obvious flaws in the system. We’re living with
their influence to this day, they have a million followers, completely
manufactored by fealty to the owners. I swear to god these systems have
to be publicly owned. The idea of turning to tech insiders to run them
has run its course, don’t you think. Over on Facebook this morning I saw
an old friend with a cute meme that says people should paste swastika
stickers on Teslas. That’s nice. The reason you can get away with that
is that you’re attacking innocent people. More of the same. Of course
<i>publicly owned</i> now means Musk Owned. See how things have changed,
so quickly.</p>

happening in the US is like when a person who is a lifetime smoker gets
cancer and stops smoking. You hope the cancer doesn’t kill you, and
swear to never smoke again if you’re lucky enough to survive it.
</p>
<p>
We didn’t appreciate how good we had it with our representative form of
government. We could have stopped the erosion of our power at any time,
when our reps would have more or less had to listen. Now, when we start
trying to get their attention, which hasn’t happened yet, it’s going to
be a competition between the rule of law, which is undermined, and the
forces that would keep our would-be rulers in line if only our reps felt
we were behind them, which they justifiably, do not.
</p>
<p>
The prognosis isn’t good. But we should get our shit together asap
because it’s our only hope.

PS: Blaming other people is easy and powerless. Accepting your own
responsibility and doing something to change it is powerful.

I posted a picture from our living room on fedi and noticed that the
book
<a href="https://www.celinekeller.com/who-is-afraid-of-degrowth">Who is
Afraid of Degrowth</a> by Céline Keller was visible on the coffee table.
And a bit later,
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.nz/@aimee" title="@aimee@mastodon.nz"><span
class="citation" data-cites="aimee">@aimee</span></a> shared a link to
the <a href="https://degrowth.net/">International Degrowth Network</a>,
specifically to their values and principles:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Welcome to the heart of our movement: the values and principles of
degrowth. This space explores the core ideas that drive us towards a
sustainable and equitable future, from wellbeing and community to
justice and care. As with any pluriversal movement, there are a wide
variety of values and principles, not all of which must be fulfilled at
once for something to qualify as “degrowth”. –
<a href="https://explore.degrowth.net/degrowth/values-principles/">Values
&amp; Principles: Explore degrowth</a>

<p>
I really like the two lists. Might be useful as a checklist before doing
things. There’s more on the site, of course.

<p>
Interesting
<a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/blog/we-looked-at-78-election-deepfakes-political-misinformation-is-not-an-ai-problem">analysis</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyzed every instance of AI use in elections collected by the WIRED
AI Elections Project
(<a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~sayashk/political-misinformation/WIRED-data.html">source</a>
for our analysis), which tracked known uses of AI for creating political
content during elections taking place in 2024 worldwide. In each case,
we identified what AI was used for and estimated the cost of creating
similar content without AI.
</p>
<p>
We find that (1) half of AI use isn’t deceptive, (2) deceptive content
produced using AI is nevertheless cheap to replicate <em>without</em>
AI, and (3) focusing on the demand for misinformation rather than the
supply is a much more effective way to diagnose problems and identify
interventions…

anything. Women are better in general at seeing the big picture and
managing accordingly. A man is more likely to hone in on one aspect of
the problem and if they’re good, do something brilliant, but misses out
on pretty much everything else. I, as a man, have had to severely
discipline myself to get anything done, because that’s how I’m built.
Given a chance I will always put my head down and focus on one thing
until its done, then the next and the next and so on.</p>

<p>Imho it would be smart for Musk to stop shutting things down and just
do his work, whatever it is. By creating constant shitstorms he’s making
it impossible for anyone to defend him, and you can be sure some would
be if what he was doing wasn’t so blatantly outrageous. We never voted
for that mofo. And every American alive, whatever their preference,
thinks their own vote should count. That’s going to be a massive hurdle
for them to get over.</p>

<p>
This is yet another story of commercial spyware being
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/31/whatsapp-israel-spyware">used
against</a> journalists and civil society members.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The journalists and other civil society members were being alerted of a
possible breach of their devices, with WhatsApp telling the Guardian it
had “high confidence” that the 90 users in question had been targeted
and “possibly compromised.”
</p>
<p>
It is not clear who was behind the attack. Like other spyware makers,
Paragon’s hacking software is used by government clients and WhatsApp
said it had not been able to identify the clients who ordered the
alleged attacks…

<p>I’m 99.9% sure, as crazy as it sounds, when Musk is finished with his
software project, you will have to use X for everything related to the
government. To pay taxes, to receive health care, to renew your
passport. And if you try to arrest him, he’ll stop paying interest on
the US debt, and that will be the end of the dollar as the reserve
currency of the world. He won’t just control the US government, he will
control the world economy.</p>

<h2 id="on-government-efficiency">On government efficiency</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
<tt>It’s a secret to everyone! This post is for RSS subscribers only.
<a href="https://daverupert.com/rss-club/">Read more about RSS Club</a>.
</tt>
</p>
<p>
I used to believe that the goal of the government should be efficiency.
If the government was more efficient (waves hands broadly in the air),
you could get rid of waste (again, waiving hands) and you’d need less
taxes, and that would trickle down (more hands) as more money in
people’s pockets, and you’d need less welfare (again, hands), less red
tape (hands), and less bureaucracy (hands, hands, hands), et cetera.
</p>
<p>
I’ve changed my thinking on the subject. I now think the goal of the
government should be to absorb inefficiencies.
</p>
<p>
As efficient as the fabled invisible hand of the market might be at
lowering the costs of goods and services
<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> and
creating
jobs<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> …
there are often non-economic inefficiencies that arise from rapidly
scaling to produce cheaper goods in the infinite money machine. Rather
than ignore those inefficiencies, I think the government should
understand the ways the system breaks and invest in longer term ideas
than making the stock market go up during the next quarter.
</p>
<p>
Here’s a short list of market inefficiencies where I think a government
helps:
</p>
<p>
<strong>Social Security and Medicare.</strong> Unpopular opinion, but I
sort of do see social security as a Ponzi scheme; younger people at the
bottom fund older people at the top who “got in first”. But you know
what’s a bigger problem? Elderly adults retiring with no retirement
plan. In our “Buy the latest iPhone” society,
<a href="https://usafacts.org/data-projects/retirement-savings">people
are statistically bad at planning for their own future</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Environment.</strong> The free market doesn’t nudge
companies towards making responsible environmental decisions. Even
though
<a href="https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2024/07/RMI-Cleantech-Revolution-pdf-1.pdf">electrification
is 3× more efficient than carbon</a>, the invisible hand is taking its
sweet time moving over to it. Probably because the invisible hand gave
too much money to the oil companies. We spend billions in aid for “once
in a lifetime” acts of God that happen every year now. The “more
efficient” act would be to kill carbon. We need a government to protect
the non-monetizable resources that give us life like oceans, lakes,
rivers, underground reservoirs, the air we breathe, and our forests.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Healthcare.</strong> I hate the American healthcare system. We
pay too much for too little. We don’t pay for healthcare, we pay for
insurance company lawyers to haggle about medical codes. Doctors hate
it. Patients hate it. Insurance companies reek of greed and corruption.
And each of us “doing our own research” isn’t a great because you end up
with people turning themselves blue from colloidal silver. We probably
need real doctors. And because most folks don’t need a doctor all the
time, we probably need health insurance. The current system is a handful
of state-by-state monopolies. But we know (according to Metcalfe’s law)
that the value of a network is proportional to the number of connected
users on the system. It would seem the best way to dodge insurance
marketplace inefficiencies like rising costs and low quality care would
be to have the biggest network possible (say, 330 million people?) to
create the best safety net. The market is not getting us the best price.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Defense.</strong> Every American owning their own personal tank
and missile system would be an inefficient stupid way to defend our
country. It’s probably best to centralize the cost of Defense and hire
trained armed service members for that purpose. I’m not advocating for
more military –I’d personally prefer less– but security is a core need
and it manifests at a nation-state level.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Transportation.</strong> I don’t think individuals should plan
and build their own highways. I’d like a government to do that. I also
think every American owning their own car that sits parked 95% of the
time is a waste of money and space, even if it does make the GDP chart
go up. You need a big extra room to store cars at home and a downtown
filled with concrete ramps to store cars at work. Or an enormous parking
lot to store cars at the store. Is this not a form of waste? There’s no
way a train makes money and is a profitable business… but more trains
equals less traffic. We know adding new
<a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2020/1/27/how-much-does-a-mile-of-road-actually-cost">ten
million dollar a mile</a> lanes to an already impossibly wide interstate
creates more traffic, more road rage, and more traffic deaths. That is
folly and an inefficiency governments can step in and solve.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Education.</strong> Education is a big expense. But you know
what’s more expensive? Everyone being stupid. That’s a joke… partially.
What is more expensive is everyone sourcing and paying for private
schools; most parents would not do it. You’d end up with a future labor
force with a lot less education. I think my biggest takeaway from school
closures during COVID was how glad I am the public education system
exists. Parents can work jobs, do commerce, and it allows kids to learn
and play with other kids from a cross-section of incomes, ethnic groups,
and special needs. The 1:20+ teacher-student ratio couldn’t be more
efficient in regards to childcare. If anything we need more teachers and
classrooms to keep that ratio as low as possible so education quality
goes up. Oh, and school breakfasts and lunches are super efficient too.
You can feed kids for like $1/kid, there’s no way I can hit those
numbers at home. I can’t believe this is contentious. Let kids eat.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Scientific Research.</strong> Space is expensive to get to, only
billionaires can afford it. Isn’t it nice that the government sometimes
foots the bill for scientists to also go? Beyond space, efforts like
curing cancer, computer research, or finding a new species of spider…
these are not an ultra-efficient use of funds but those discoveries
power innovation. The market doesn’t fund Science unless it makes money
in an A/B test. We’d end up with more patent-pending boner pills instead
of understanding of our universe. Real science is a bunch of inefficient
question and answer seeking that changes the course of human history.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Human Rights.</strong> One way to drive down costs under
Capitalism is to hire labor at the cheapest rate possible. Historically,
our great nation has relied on slaves (yikes!) and children (yikes!) for
cheap sources of labor. You’d have to work long hours for low pay and
then a machine would cut off your arm and your employer would say “Well,
you can’t work here anymore” and kick you out. Isn’t it great to have a
government to correct this moral inefficiency? It didn’t happen
overnight, of course. Countless churches and patriotic do-gooders were
fine with justifying and upholding the old system. Even fought a war
about it.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
I could keep going, but there’s a billion and one jobs a government can
do to improve the life and well-being of its citizens. Old habits die
hard, I guess, because I’m still thinking about efficiency… but from the
opposite angle. A government is perhaps best-situated to absorb
inefficiencies at scale. Will there be inefficiency and waste and
kingdom-building within a super-system like a government? For sure.
Systems should always seek to improve. To begin fixing those problems
you need data and transparency.
</p>
<p>
The more you understand Capitalism, the more you understand it’s a game.
It’s a game with an enormous exploit. I’m talking Blanka in the corner
levels of bullshit. The government <em>should</em> exist to fix those
systems and curb those bad actors. But the system continues to reward
them and heap tax break after tax break as a reward to their fellow
co-conspirators in exchange for campaign contributions and lavish trips.
Talk about inefficiency. Dumping piles of money into the hands of people
who already have money. Sheesh.

in response to the tariffs, respectful, talking direct to Americans
about the bonds with the people of Canada. Why can’t the Dems do this,

pay for that. Get in the game Dems.</p>
