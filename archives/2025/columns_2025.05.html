<p>I saw a bit on CNN that was like the Dean Scream, an extended clip of
how awkward Chuck Schumer is at a rally. It was used to shame a Democrat
who was doing a great job of explaining the danger, Sen Murphy of
Connecticut. I switched to basketball in disgust, thinking these people,
CNN, are not serious. This problem isn’t on the Dems, it’s on all of us,
and it always was. To pin it on the Dems is to say it’s hopeless because
right now they’re just our representatives in Congress and some of our
state governments. We have a big problem and we probably can’t dig out
of it, but if we have any hope at all, orgs like CNN have to stop being
such idiots. Every so often I see a spark of brilliance over there, and
then one of these things happens. What’s more depressing, Trump or CNN?
CNN by a lot. And the NYT and all the rest of the broken media. We are
all in the same boat.</p>

<p>In January I started <a href="https://this.how/myAppList/">an online
diary</a> where I list each of the apps I manage, as I work on them.
When I work on one, I move it to the top. The notes are brief and to
anyone but me might seem cryptic. But at least you can follow what I’m
doing. No I don’t plan to do an RSS feed for it. It’s just a place to
keep track of all the things I work on, for people who I work with, and
most important, me.</p>

I’ve had nuclear energy on the mind recently — a product of watching
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15398776/"><cite>Oppenheimer</cite></a>,
perhaps, and also the
<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c805mjxe2y9o"><abbr class="initialism">UK</abbr>
government’s newfound interest in nuclear power</a> in the interest of
combatting climate change. Apropos of all that, then, I was happy to
appear on
<a href="https://amsecast.libsyn.com/building-the-empire-of-the-sum-with-keith-houston">a
recent episode of AMSEcast</a>, the podcast of the
<a href="https://amse.org/">American Museum of Science and Energy</a> in
Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The episode was hosted by the museum’s director,
the genial Alan Lowe, who was kind enough to let me rabbit on at length
on the subjects of counting, calculators, and computers. I really
enjoyed talking to Alan, and I hope you enjoy listening too!

<h1 id="2025-02-06-discord-for-role-playing-games">
2025-02-06 Discord for role-playing games
</h1>
<p>
Discord really works well for my gaming. I even pay them. 😬 And as far
as finding new players goes: essentially there are some generic servers,
some servers for particular games or publishers, and for your tables. So
you “look for games” in the first two category of servers and then you
send interested parties an invite to the server for your table(s).
</p>
<p>
It’s a bit weird but it works for me.
</p>
<p>
I don’t use Discord as a chat or forum in the first two kinds of
servers. Way too many people and crazy amount of text flying by! But on
those small gaming table server? 🥰
</p>
<p>
I just look the other way when they ask me about my activities shat they
can share what music I listen to and what games I play. No way!
</p>
<p>
One thing that Discord does better than IRC is help handle the dizzying
amount of channels per server (i.e. per publisher, rule set or gaming
table); their specific rules; their independent admins; their roles;
their selective visibility: channels for certain roles only, for certain
people only, group chat (ephemeral private channels); their local bots
and automations; media uploads; muting for channels and servers, for
certain time periods only or until you reverse your decision. All of
this is great.
</p>
<p>
Yes, you can self-host an IRC server and a web frontend like The Lounge
(which I do) and you can get close: many channels, but all are equal:
there is no formal grouping, no independent moderation, no independent
roles, no independent bots. It’s all one big soup. And if you add some
rules via nickserv and chanserv, it might get you all the way but is
still quite arcane. What a difference Discord makes. Plus effortless
voice chat. 🥰
</p>
<p>
Yes, voice chat and video chat, on top of all that.
</p>
<p>
Now, you might think: what a shill! But really: I self-host the
inferior-but-free options. I write my bot to connect to both (!) IRC and
Discord and free content from the black void that is the endless Discord
archives. But I also want things to just work. My time is more precious
than the €10 (?) I spend every month. And I had to take down Jitsi
because it was too resource intensive. The alternative would have been
to upgrade my lousy server and spend more time sysadminning and I don’t
want to.
</p>
<p>
So self-hosted IRC has voice and video only if I leech Jitsi from
somebody else, as far as I am concerned.
</p>
<p>
So I don’t know where to go from here. I just pay them for the service.
And I look the other way when they disallow other clients. 😓
</p>
<p>
But then again: I used Bitlbee for a long time. I even wrote a plugin
that lets you connect to your fedi instance as if it was an IRC server
and another kind soul wrote a plugin that does the same for Discord. And
then you start to realize how unusable this is. I’m on maybe two dozen
servers? My account has access to 200+ channels, all of the active, all
of them need some sort of mapping to IRC channels? It’s hell.
Notifications were out of control. I stopped doing it. So: is Discord
shit, or the IRC clients? I don’t know. But I know that Discord is not
all bad. It’s definitely not bad as an idea of how to organize a
gazillion people.
</p>
<p>
But I do look the other way when I think about tracking and AI training
and data brokering.🖕I don’t even know if they do it but these are the
days of zero trust and fucking corpo greed maggot CEOs so it doesn’t
really matter what they do specifically because I don’t trust any
company to do the right thing. Maybe I’d trust them if they were a
non-profit association.
</p>
<p>
Anyway. Just putting this out there because with Discord I’m playing
three or four times a week and I only don’t play more because I do want
to get out every now and then. 😆

Reminder to all feminists
</h2>
<p>
If you accept trans people being defined by their reproductive role…<br>
Then men can define all woman by their reproductive role
</p>
<p>
If you accept that trans teenagers are too young to make decisions about
their bodies…<br> Then men can decide teenage girls are too young to
make decisions about their bodies
</p>
<p>
If you accept medical gatekeeping of trans people’s access to
hormones…<br> Then doctors can restrict any woman’s access to HRT and
birth control
</p>
<p>
If you accept stripping trans people of legal protections…<br> Then men
can strip women of legal protections
</p>
<p>
This is the truth of “trans rights are human rights”.<br> Regardless of
your personal feelings on whether trans people are “really” the gender
they say they are, the exact same human rights protecting us also
underlie women’s liberation– bodily autonomy, dignity, equality of
opportunity, and protection from harm.<br> And so many men are desperate
for those rights to disappear.

I asked ChatGPT to try it out. “I want to tell a story about a typical
person who works for the US government. It shouldn’t be a glamorous job,
but an important one. It should improve people’s lives, health,
happiness, fulfillment. Pick the role at random, as well as gender, age,
race, geography. Write a 100 word job description, and provide a
realistic looking profile picture. Nothing about their personal life, or
actual name, but it’s okay to talk about the required education and
experience for the job.”
</p>
<p>
Here’s what it came back with: “An Environmental Health Officer (EHO)
plays a crucial role in safeguarding public health by identifying and
mitigating environmental hazards. Employed by federal agencies such as
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), EHOs conduct inspections of
facilities like restaurants, swimming pools, and nursing homes to ensure
compliance with health regulations. They investigate complaints related
to air and water quality, noise, and waste management, and implement
measures to prevent disease outbreaks. A bachelor’s degree in
environmental health or a related field is typically required, with many
positions preferring candidates with a master’s degree. Professional
certification, such as Registered Environmental Health Specialist
(REHS), is often preferred. Strong analytical skills, attention to
detail, and the ability to communicate effectively are essential for
success in this role.”

Regulation of cryptocurrencies was an issue in last November’s US
election. Molly White documented the immense sums the industry devoted
to electing a
<a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/issue-70/">crypto-friendly
Congress</a>, and converting Trump’s skepticism into enthusiasm. They
had two goals, pumping the price and avoiding any regulation that would
hamper them ripping off the suckers.<br /> <br /> Back in November of
2022 I added an entry to this blog’s list of
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/09/impossibilities.html"><i>Impossibilities</i></a>
for
<a href="https://datafinnovation.medium.com/the-compliance-innovation-trade-off-72b9f8026f56"><i>The
Compliance-Innovation Trade-off</i></a> from the team at ChainArgos. It
started:<br />
<blockquote>
<i>tl;dr: DeFi cannot be permissionless, allow arbitrary innovation and
comply with any meaningful regulations. You can only choose two of those
properties. If you accept a limited form of innovation you can have
two-and-a-half of them.</i><br /> <br /> Fundamental results in logic
and computer science impose a trade-off on any permissionless system’s
ability to both permit innovation and achieve compliance with
non-trivial regulations. This result depends only on long-settled
concepts and the assumption a financial system must provide a logically
consistent view of payments and balances to users.<br /> <br /> This is
a semi-technical treatment, with more formal work proceeding elsewhere.
</blockquote>
Two years later, the “more formal work” has finally been published in a
peer-reviewed Nature Publishing journal,
<a href="https://www.nature.com/srep/"><i>Scientific Reports</i></a>,
which claims to be the 5<sup>th</sup> most cited journal in the world.
Jonathan Reiter tells me that, although the publishing process took two
years, it did make the result better.<br /> <br /> Below the fold I
discuss
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-84612-9"><i>Tradeoffs
in automated financial regulation of decentralized finance due to limits
on mutable turing machines</i></a> by Ben Charoenwong, Robert M. Kirby
&amp; Jonathan Reiter.<br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span> <br />
This team were pioneers in applying fundamental computer science
theorems to blockchain-based systems, starting in April 2022 with
<a href="https://datafinnovation.medium.com/the-consequences-of-scalable-blockchains-8c4d23c6af4d"><i>The
Consequences of Scalable Blockchains</i></a> in which they showed that
implementing an Ethereum-like system whose performance in all cases is
guaranteed to be faster than any single node in the network is
equivalent to solving the great unsolved problem in the theory of
computation, nicknamed P vs. NP. And thus that if it were implemented,
the same technique could break all current cryptography, including that
underlying Ethereum.<br /> <br /> But, I believe, they were not the
first. That appears to have been Tjaden Hess, River Keefer, and Emin Gün
Sirer in
<a href="https://hackingdistributed.com/2016/06/28/ethereum-soft-fork-dos-vector/"><i>Ethereum’s
DAO Wars Soft Fork is a Potential DoS Vector</i></a> (28<sup>th</sup>
June 2016), which applied the
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">halting
problem</a>” to “smart contracts” when analyzing possible defenses
against DOS attacks on a “soft fork” of Ethereum proposed in response to
“The DAO”.<br /> <br /> Charoenwong <i>et al</i>’s abstract
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-84612-9">states</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
We examine which decentralized finance architectures enable meaningful
regulation by combining financial and computational theory. We show via
deduction that a decentralized and permissionless Turing-complete system
cannot provably comply with regulations concerning anti-money
laundering, know-your-client obligations, some securities restrictions
and forms of exchange control. Any system that claims to follow
regulations must choose either a form of permission or a
less-than-Turing-complete update facility. Compliant decentralized
systems can be constructed only by compromising on the richness of
permissible changes. Regulatory authorities must accept new tradeoffs
that limit their enforcement powers if they want to approve
permissionless platforms formally. Our analysis demonstrates that the
fundamental constraints of computation theory have direct implications
for financial regulation. By mapping regulatory requirements onto
computational models, we characterize which types of automated
compliance are achievable and which are provably impossible. This
framework allows us to move beyond traditional debates about regulatory
effectiveness to establish concrete boundaries for automated
enforcement.
</blockquote>
They summarize the fundamental problem for the automation of
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-84612-9">DeFi
regulation</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
DeFi features some computationally challenging properties: (1)
Turing-complete programming, (2) permissionless access to both transact
and publish code and (3) selectively immutable code. The permissionless
mutability of the system combined with the Turing completeness motivates
our inquiry. A system running Turing-complete code where updates can be
published permissionlessly cannot make any guarantees about its future
behavior, a conclusion from early work on Universal Turing Machines
(UTM).
</blockquote>
Despite this, they show that if it is possible to enforce
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-84612-9">less-than-Turing-complete
programming</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
it is possible to construct both (1) classes of algorithms that can make
credible promises and (2) restricted update mechanisms that enable
credible promises. In other words, DeFi platforms can provide compliant
services like traditional centralized providers through fully automatic
mechanisms.
</blockquote>
What exaxctly do they mean by
“<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-84612-9">compliant</a>”?<br />
<blockquote>
Consider an economy modeled as a Turing Machine, where the machine’s
state corresponds to the state of the real economy. We formalize
compliance as a property of system state transitions that can be
verified mechanically, following Theorem 5.8.5 of Savage. Specifically,
a compliant system is one where no sequence of permitted operations can
result in a state that violates predefined regulatory constraints set by
an external regulator.
</blockquote>
They translate this into
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-84612-9">economic
terms</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
For example, if a regulation prohibits transactions with certain
addresses, compliance means no sequence of permitted operations can
transfer value to those addresses, either directly or indirectly.
Similarly a regulator may impose requirements on intermediaries
transacting in certain assets or products akin to depository receipts
for those assets. Compliance would then require ensuring one does not
unknowingly transact in “products akin to depository receipts” for a
given list of assets.
</blockquote>
Because they model regulated systems in terms of states and the
transitions between them, they can apply
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-84612-9">results from
compputer science</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
This formulation maps to well-known results in computability, such as
the Halting Problem and the more general impossibility known as Rice’s
Theorem: No algorithm exists to determine from the description of a
[Turing Machine] whether or not the language it accepts falls into any
proper subset of the recursively enumerable languages. In other words,
we cannot categorize arbitrary programs into specific subsets
automatically and reliably. In financial regulation, the canonical
“proper subset” is a ban on interacting with a given address:
interactions involving a banned address are forbidden, and the
acceptable subset of states includes no such transfers.
</blockquote>
They proceed to use cryptocurrency “mixers” as an example. They explain
that Rice’s Theorem means that because any general description of
“mixers” defines a “proper subset” of all programs, and thus there is no
automatic or reliable method by which a “smart contract” can be assessed
against the general description.<br /> <br /> Of course, as Justice
Potter Stewart famously said
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it">I know
it when I see it</a>”. Human regulators will have no difficulty in
recognizing a “smart contract” as a mixer, if only because in order to
function it needs liquidity. To attract it the “smart contract” needs to
advertise its service. So can the regulators ban interactions with the
specific addresses of the mixers they recognize? Charoenwong <i>et
al</i> make <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-84612-9">two
arguments</a><br />
<blockquote>
First, this severely limits the regulator’s power from regulating a
mutable set of protocols to only specific ones. In other words, what is
often called “principles-based” regulations (as opposed to rules-based
regulations) are impossible. We cannot ban “mixers” generally – we can
only ban “mixers A, B and C.” In some sense, this is akin to banning
specific means of murder rather than simply banning murder, no matter
the means.
</blockquote>
Then they introduce the time element inherent in
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-84612-9">human
regulation</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Second, and more importantly, we cannot enforce even these more
straightforward rules reliably. Consider these steps:<br />
<ol>
<li>
Deploy a new, confusingly-coded, “mixer” labeled X
</li>
<li>
Send funds to the mixer X
</li>
<li>
Withdraw from the mixer X and feed into the mixer A
</li>
<li>
Withdraw from the mixer A and feed into the mixer X
</li>
<li>
Withdraw from the mixer X and spend freely
</li>
</ol>
This procedure works because we cannot identify arbitrary mixers, so we
are free to deploy and then use them before they get put on the banned
list. As a result, the regulator cannot even ban all interaction with
enumerated mixers – it can only reliably ban some forms of interaction.
This result is a severe limit on regulatory power.<br /> <br /> If we
consider that compliance exists in an automated form, operating on
publicly available data in real-time, anyone accepting that final
transfer must operate in a compliant fashion. If, instead, the plan is
to decide these things later based on non-mechanical analysis, we are
simply operating a conventional legal system with some more computers
involved. Concretely, if that last transfer can be ruled illegal after
the fact, it was never an automated financial system.
</blockquote>
This result generalizes to services other than mixers. Rice’s Theorem
means it isn’t possible to ban a class of services, and banning
individual services identified by humans will always be behind the
curve.<br /> <br /> The authors illustrate the application of their
result with real-world examples of
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-84612-9">regulatory
failure</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
These case studies-The DAO, Beanstalk Finance, Compound, Terra/LUNA, and
MakerDAO-collectively illustrate the practical manifestations of our
paper’s theoretical findings. Each example demonstrates a different
facet of the challenges in implementing reliable, automated compliance
mechanisms in decentralized, Turing- complete systems. From governance
attacks to stablecoin collapses and liquidation issues, these incidents
underscore the impossibility of guaranteeing specific regulatory
outcomes without compromising system flexibility or introducing external
interventions.
</blockquote>
The authors argue that there are two ways to construct a system that
does allow automated regulation, by making it permissioned rather than
permissionless, or by enforcing a non-Turing-complete language for the
“smart contracts”. In practice many cryptocurrencies are permissioned —
in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/04/decentralized-systems-arent.html"><i>Decentralized
Systems Aren’t</i></a> I pointed out that:<br />
<blockquote>
The fact that the coins ranked 3, 6 and 7 by “market cap” don’t even
claim to be decentralized shows that decentralization is irrelevant to
cryptocurrency users.
</blockquote>
There are many examples of cryptocurrency systems that claim to be
decentralized but are actually permissioned. Patrick Tan described one
in
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/binance-built-a-blockchain-except-it-didnt-5759224ba7aa"><i>Binance
Built a Blockchain, Except it Didn’t</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
For all its claims of promoting decentralization, Binance runs two
“blockchains” that are not just highly centralized, but regularly alter
history, undermining one of the core tenets of the blockchain —
immutability.
</blockquote>
The authors’ example of a
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-84612-9">non-Turing-complete
language</a> is:<br />
<blockquote>
Consider a scripting language where we cannot have variables. A simple
“splitting the tab” contract might look like:<br />
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjNRgz5Wcc3tXJJfFQUQ_9jJ06vS-o0TmbHdKvoPx8SvkaNsqwBBE6o8wpoH2TNeqxoQAbVEQYBQft94zKcBy7HO8DsoVxzJm1-Vk9M5ukqAX8L-e8YeF4P9Zlk25GUb82lLgII5ImDaSnPyTYyYgXkZbVfJTKVE7PDHx6WSevfYhyphenhyphenlNaX9TKNksAX_p4uq/s1292/SplitTheTab.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="0" data-original-height="392" data-original-width="1292" height="121" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjNRgz5Wcc3tXJJfFQUQ_9jJ06vS-o0TmbHdKvoPx8SvkaNsqwBBE6o8wpoH2TNeqxoQAbVEQYBQft94zKcBy7HO8DsoVxzJm1-Vk9M5ukqAX8L-e8YeF4P9Zlk25GUb82lLgII5ImDaSnPyTYyYgXkZbVfJTKVE7PDHx6WSevfYhyphenhyphenlNaX9TKNksAX_p4uq/w400-h121/SplitTheTab.png" width="400" /></a>
This is dangerous if we have a regulation that certain addresses cannot
be paid. The issues raised surrounding the DAO hack, discussed above,
apply here. But what if the only way to transfer a token is to call
SendTo and that function looks like:<br />
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEis5GTH5H1GMc41uu95_FzidtecuhCDVSrGfzDFlImPZX5Am8tgq4CT5ibQO6wg-NIlMt4aNhXQM4J70GV1O_dJd498TvSXBrW8xHqPX9J_lo80o2Gn60aSQJL6LB4z6gmf0aCD9gQYskTDlzIUKcg7bFGepYe2-nL_xnSR1tcdxnXLVA-RU6y8AId0zSYC/s1014/SendTo.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="530" data-original-width="1014" height="167" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEis5GTH5H1GMc41uu95_FzidtecuhCDVSrGfzDFlImPZX5Am8tgq4CT5ibQO6wg-NIlMt4aNhXQM4J70GV1O_dJd498TvSXBrW8xHqPX9J_lo80o2Gn60aSQJL6LB4z6gmf0aCD9gQYskTDlzIUKcg7bFGepYe2-nL_xnSR1tcdxnXLVA-RU6y8AId0zSYC/w320-h167/SendTo.png" width="320" /></a>
There is no issue if a function only calls RealSendTo from SendTo. In
such cases, the regulator’s responsibility is to maintain the
BannedList, and the system is permissioned.
</blockquote>
Their example of a system that is not-Turing-complete is not useful,
because it requires BannedList to be a constant. As they point out, if
the system is to be useful, BannedList must be a variable that is
updated by the regulator, and thus the system is permissioned. It may
well be that, because BannedList is a variable, that the system is
Turing-complete after all. I can’t do the analysis to determine if this
is the case, but it is known that even a small number of variables makes
a system Turing-complete.<br /> <br /> Thus the paper is somewhat
misleading, in the sense that it reads as if regulated systems can be
either permissioned <b>or</b> not-Turing-complete, but it fails to
provide an example of a system that is permissionless and
not-Turing-complete. The example that looks as if it is going to be
not-Turing-complete but permissionless seems to be permissioned
<b>and</b> not-Turing-complete.<br /> <br /> I would argue somewhat
differently:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Charoenwong <i>et al</i> show that a permissionless, Turing-complete
system cannot be regulated.
</li>
<li>
In the real world no-one is going to cripple their system by making it
not-Turing-complete.
</li>
<li>
Even if a not-Turing-complete system could be built it isn’t clear that
it would be useful.
</li>
<li>
In essence, the regulatory act of enforcing that a system is, and
remains, not-Turing-complete <i>is</i> permissioning the system.
</li>
<li>
Thus in practice permissionless systems cannot be regulated.
</li>

the two years since their initial post it has been overtaken by events.

equity-linked securities to buy bitcoin, boosting bitcoin’s price, which
in turn inflates MicroStrategy valuation. This allows it to issue more
stock and repeat the cycle.<br /> <br /> This MonoStrategy has enabled
MicroStrategy to acquire <a href="https://www.mstr-tracker.com/">2.25

current prices. The company trades at nearly double the value of its
underlying bitcoin holdings, a testament to belief of some investors in
Michael Saylor’s project.<br /> …<br /> As long as the stock trades at a
premium to its bitcoin holdings, the company can keep issuing novel
securities and finding new buyers. Meanwhile, with MicroStrategy
comprising a sizeable portion of crypto inflows (28 per cent in 2024,

Even if it were possible to regulate real-world cryptocurrencies, there
no longer appears to be any political support for doing so. And thus
Michael P. Regan reports on
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-04/a-sunday-night-flash-crash-in-the-most-insane-casino-ever-created"><i>A
Sunday Night Flash Crash in the ‘Most Insane Casino Ever
Created’</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
a major flash crash in Ether as leveraged positions were liquidated
served as a stark reminder of how digital-asset markets still lack
almost all of the guardrails installed on traditional markets over the
years due to various misadventures that hurt investors. The
second-largest token was down a bit as traditional markets opened for
trading Monday morning in Asia, reacting to concerns about US tariffs
against Canada and Mexico. Then in a matter of minutes its losses
extended to about 27%, before quickly recovering.<br /> …<br /> There’s
no indication that any of that is likely to change anytime soon. So
Sunday night’s price action in Ether – and similar dives in a slew of
other altcoins and memecoins – serves as a reminder that for better or
worse this asset class still exists far outside of the padded walls of
traditional markets, regardless of how much tradfi embraces it.

<p>date: 2025-02-06, from: mrusme blog</p>
<p>“Fukuoka is the sixth-largest city in Japan and the capital city of
Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. The city is built along the shores of Hakata
Bay, and has been a center of international commerce since ancient
times. The area has long been considered the gateway to the country, as
it is the nearest point among Japan’s main islands to the Asian
mainland. Although humans occupied the area since the Jomon period, some
of the earliest settlers of the Yayoi period arrived in the Fukuoka
area. The city rose to prominence during the Yamato period. Because of
the cross-cultural exposure, and the relatively great distance from the
social and political centers of Kyoto, Osaka, and later, Edo (Tokyo),
Fukuoka gained a distinctive local culture and dialect that has
persisted to the present.”</p>

<p>date: 2025-02-06, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-01-23-the-bots-are-at-it-again">
2025-01-23 The bots are at it again
</h1>
<p>
For a while I just appended new graphs and data to
<a href="2024-11-25-emacs-china">the last post on this topic</a>. This
time around I feel it’s worse. There are so many bots that I can’t even
do the WHOIS lookup any more. Or perhaps I just managed to block so few
that I never realized how many more there were. In any case, now that
I’m speeding things up, there are more bots to block.
</p>
<p>
<strong>If you want to partake in unsupervised banning with no feedback,
no due process, just automatic ban-hammers, take a look at this script
full of firewall commands.</strong>
</p>
<p>
It needs ipset and iptables access:
<a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a>.
</p>
<p>
I blocked another 4669 networks.
</p>
<p>
What I did was get the most recent 10000 lines from the Apache access
log, filter out all the requests for my GoToSocial instance (hoping that
it has good defences!?), grepping for the magic word,
<a href="/admin/network-lookup-lean">doing reverse lookups</a> using
<code>asn.routeviews.org</code> and banning them all. Looking at a
summary, there were two networks with 6 requests, 6 networks with 5
requests, etc. Of the 4669 networks banned, there were 3985 networks
with a single request only.
</p>
<p>
That is to say, the network lookup is not really all that efficient
because the requests are so incredibly diverse. There are essentially no
individual IP numbers to ban because there are no repeat offenders, and
even with that great ban-hammer of mine, this wouldn’t help against the
next 85% of requests because they are all unique.
</p>
<p>
Now, I was already banning about 10,000 networks yesterday, and their
success rate is still 85%! So that tells you that even this little
jousting I’m doing is tilting at windmills because these bots are
turning the web to shit.
</p>
<p>
Summing the numbers I see that I looked at 10,000 requests, discarded
all the hits for my GoToSocial instance and still had 5560 bot hits.
</p>
<p>
Every website everywhere is paying the distributed price for these
leeches to keep their projects running. Of course, I could rent a bigger
machine, run a bigger cache, spending more money and more time for their
scam.
</p>
<p>
I keep shouting “CO₂ for the CO₂ god!” and that’s part of it, yes…
Sadly!
</p>
<p>
Oh, and I could not post this on fedi because my GoToSocial instance is
unable to cope and takes a very long time to recover from the onslaught.
While I waited, I banned another 2184 networks. And I kept doing it.
</p>
<p>
Fuck this shit.
</p>
<p>
Fuck this whole generation.
</p>
<p>
Time passes.
</p>
<p>
Let me count how many entries I added today.
</p>
<pre><code>awk 'BEGIN {c=0; n=0} /^# 2025-01-23/ {c=1} c&amp;&amp;/^ipset/ {n++} END {print n}' \
  bin/admin/ban-cidr
14497
</code></pre>
<p>
I think it’s about time to add some fail2ban code. If only I knew how.
More cost they are putting on every single site operator and service
provider out there.
</p>
<p>
Right now load is below 4, so that’s not too bad for 2 cores. The sites
are still sluggish. I some sort of congestion issue.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-01-23-bots-devouring-the-web-1.jpg" alt="Netstats showing connections established spiking." />
</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Butlerian_Jihad">#Butlerian Jihad</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-01-24</strong>. What I did all day, yesterday:
</p>
<pre><code># prefix with a timestamp
date; tail -n 2000 /var/log/apache2/access.log \
 | grep -v ^social \
 | grep &quot;rcidonly&quot; \
 | bin/admin/network-lookup-lean &gt; result.log
# count
grep ipset result.log|wc -l
# add
grep ipset result.log|sh
# document
grep ipset result.log&gt;&gt;bin/admin/ban-cidr
</code></pre>
<p>
But today:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-01-23-bots-devouring-the-web-2.jpg" alt="After midnight, load climbed up to 40 and stayed up there" />
</p>
<p>
I think made a mistake, yesterday around midnight. I rebooted the server
and didn’t run the script! 😱
</p>
<p>
I thought the packages <code>netfilter-persistent</code>,
<code>iptables-persistent</code> and <code>ipset-persistent</code> took
care of that but that is not the case. See below for more.
</p>
<p>
In any case, I think the graphs above illustrates what happens to my
server without the firewall rules.
</p>
<p>
Grrr.
</p>
<p>
They said we’re running out of IPv4 numbers but now that I’m trying to
block bots descending like flesh flies on baby bison, it turns out that
there are still thousands of networks that need blocking. Holy cow may
Baal eat the eyes of all the engineers partaking in this scouring of the
web; may all the project managers rot and lose their teeth, their nails,
their hair and their sense of smell; let them all suffer these curses
until they repent, until they mend their ways and help undo the damage
they are wreaking.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Later that day</strong>. I got an email asking about the bots
and so I looked at the last run. Let’s take the last run:
</p>
<pre><code>$ head result.log
Made 763 DNS requests.
21 cache hits.
Range                          |       Hits |
------------------------------:|-----------:|
                       unknown |          4 |

               45.178.110.0/23 |          2 |
</code></pre>
<p>
The top hitting network I blocked in the last run had made just
<em>three</em> suspicious requests!
</p>
<p>
There is more info below:
</p>
<pre><code>38.188.60.0/24
38.188.60.92 38.188.60.70 38.188.60.70
38.188.60.0/24 | 38.188.60.92 | 24/Jan/2025:11:57:58 +0100 | GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;days=3&amp;rcidonly=Comments_on_VimMode&amp;showedit=0 HTTP/1.1 | Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/88.0.4324.150 Safari/537.36
38.188.60.0/24 | 38.188.60.70 | 24/Jan/2025:11:58:47 +0100 | GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;from=1730419325&amp;rcidonly=profh&amp;showedit=1 HTTP/1.1 | Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/73.0.3683.86 Safari/537.36
38.188.60.0/24 | 38.188.60.70 | 24/Jan/2025:12:01:02 +0100 | GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;days=3&amp;rcidonly=2013-11-08&amp;showedit=1 HTTP/1.1 | Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/100.0.3478.83 Safari/537.36
ipset add banlist 38.188.60.0/24
</code></pre>
<p>
So the three requests from this network came from just two different IP
numbers:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
38.188.60.92
</li>
<li>
38.188.60.70
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The first suspicious request is for a list of recent changes made in the
last 3 days for the page “Comments on VimMode”.
</p>
<p>
Let’s check whether this is a false positive. Perhaps the request
belongs into a sequence that makes sense to a human?
</p>
<pre><code>$ grep 38.188.60.92 /var/log/apache2/access.log /var/log/apache2/access.log.1 
/var/log/apache2/access.log:www.emacswiki.org:443 38.188.60.92 - - [24/Jan/2025:11:57:58 +0100] &quot;GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;days=3&amp;rcidonly=Comments_on_VimMode&amp;showedit=0 HTTP/1.1&quot; 503 3868 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/88.0.4324.150 Safari/537.36&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>
This strange request is the only request this IP number made in over
24h.
</p>
<p>
The only explanation I have is that the URL belongs to a dataset used to
train AI, using bots running from machines rented all around the world.
Or it’s a denial of service attack.

<strong>2025-01-25</strong>. I think I finally understand the packages
about making it all persistent:
</p>
<p>
<code>netfilter-persistent</code> calls all the modules.
</p>
<p>
<code>iptables-persistent</code> is the module that saves
<code>/etc/iptables/rules.v4</code> and
<code>/etc/iptables/rules.v6</code> with just the rules.
</p>
<p>
<code>ipset-persistent</code> is the module that saves
<code>/etc/iptables/ipsets</code>. This file is about 1MB and pretty
much contains what <code>ban-cidr</code> contains.
</p>
<p>
And as it turns out, saving is never automatic.
</p>
<p>
You need to run <code>netfilter-persistent save</code> manually after
running <code>ban-cidr</code> for all the rules and sets to be loaded on
a reboot.

For now, I keep returning a 410 “Gone” response to self-identified bots
and I just drop packets from networks that have hosted bots at the
firewall. There are probably problems with this system as packets from
fediverse instances hosted by the same providers get cut off, too. And
I’m not expiring the bans, unfortunately.

to build Ollama to run LLMs on RISC-V Linux</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;RISC-V is the new entrant into the SBC/low-end desktop space, and as I&#39;m in possession of a HiFive Premier P550 motherboard, I am running it through my usual gauntlet of benchmarks—partly to see how fast it is, and partly to gauge how far along RISC-V support is in general across a wide swath of Linux software.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
From my first tests on the
<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/risc-v-business-testing-starfives-visionfive-2-sbc">VisionFive
2 back in 2023</a> to today, RISC-V has seen quite a bit of growth,
fueled by economics, geopolitical wrangling, and developer interest.
</p>
<p>
The P550 uses the ESWIN EIC7700X SoC, and while it doesn’t have a
<em>fast</em> CPU, by modern standards, it is fast enough—and the system
has enough RAM and IO—to run most modern Linux-y things. Including
llama.cpp and Ollama!
</p>
<h2>
Compiling Ollama for RISC-V Linux
</h2>
<p>
I’m running Ubuntu 24.04.1 on my P550 board, and when I try running
Ollama’s simple install script, I get:

of my blog voted for Trump. I can’t imagine too many did, unless they’ve
been willing to overlook my strenuous support for any option that
opposes him. However if any of you are still here, I’d like you to know
that what’s happening now is exactly what we thought <i>would</i>
happen. If you agree that this is unacceptable, maybe we can use that as
common ground to work together to get our country back from the chaotic
authoritarian mess that Elon Musk is turning it into. He makes Trump
look like an absolute moderate. Certainly no one who voted for Trump
with any kind of appreciation for the American system, where your vote
and mine matter, can stand by and not object to what he’s doing to our
system of government. If not now, keep this in mind as Musk’s chaos
becomes more and more real.</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
Understand what the system can do and where it is applied.
</li>
<li>
You don’t have to compute gradients to break an AI system.

AI red teaming is not safety benchmarking.
</li>
<li>
Automation can help cover more of the risk landscape.

<li>
The human element of AI red teaming is crucial.

Responsible AI harms are pervasive but difficult to measure.

possibly was a bit hasty in
<a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/04.html#a204729">declaring the

from the courts telling Musk to stop, and so far Trump has been obeying
those, so there’s some hope when that happens he’ll order Musk to stop,
and then we’ll find out who the boss is and how our new post-coup
reality works. The shock of Trump’s
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9w5q8qn59yo">plan for
Gaza</a>, announced yesterday may get even the most “loyal” Repubs in
Congress to think again about what hell they hath wrought on they
country they all grew up in. I have some faith that American values are

<h2 id="borgbackup-for-the-laptop-and-the-server">2025-01-31 BorgBackup
for the laptop and the server</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-01-31-borgbackup-for-the-laptop-and-the-server">
2025-01-31 BorgBackup for the laptop and the server
</h1>
<p>
A few days ago I mentioned the
<a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-01-27-rsync-sqlite">rsync-based
backup script</a> I use to copy data from the server to the laptop.
</p>
<p>
The backup script that makes backups of my laptop (including the backup
from the server) to external disks is different, however.
</p>
<p>
My actual backup uses external disks. I have two of them. One of them is
always at the office. Every now and then (not often enough!) I make a
backup to the external disk I have at hand and then I carry it to the
office and bring the other one back. That is, the laptop and the two
external disks are never in the same location.
</p>
<p>
The two external disks I use are “known backup disks”. When I plug them
in, BorgBackup immediately starts making a backup. I discussed this
setup <a href="2017-12-24_Borg_Backup">back in 2017</a>.
</p>
<p>
I’m just going to repost the stuff and I don’t think there have been any
significant changes.
</p>
<p>
Run commands and create files as root.
</p>
<p>
Either use <code>sudo</code> for every command you run, or use
<code>sudo su</code> once and do everything as root. No matter how you
do it, the danger zone awaits!
</p>
<h2 id="mnt-backup">
<code>/mnt/backup</code>
</h2>
<p>
Create the mount point on the laptop:
</p>
<pre><code>mkdir /mnt/backup
</code></pre>
<h2 id="etc-fstab">
<code>/etc/fstab</code>
</h2>
<p>
Any disk labeled “Backup” will be mounted as <code>/mnt/backup</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>LABEL=Backup /mnt/backup auto nosuid,nodev,nofail,noauto,x-gvfs-show 0 0
</code></pre>
<h2 id="etc-backups-40-backup-rules">
<code>/etc/backups/40-backup.rules</code>
</h2>
<p>
Install a symlink to this file:
</p>
<pre><code>ln -s /etc/backups/40-backup.rules \
      /etc/udev/rules.d/40-backup.rules
</code></pre>
<p>
The file content:
</p>
<pre><code>ACTION==&quot;add&quot;, SUBSYSTEM==&quot;bdi&quot;, DEVPATH==&quot;/devices/virtual/bdi/*&quot;, TAG+=&quot;systemd&quot;, ENV{SYSTEMD_WANTS}=&quot;automatic-backup.service&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>
This makes sure that the service <code>automatic-backup</code> starts
whenever an external disk gets plugged into the laptop.
</p>
<h2 id="etc-backups-automatic-backup-service">
<code>/etc/backups/automatic-backup.service</code>
</h2>
<p>
Install a symlink to this file:
</p>
<pre><code>ln -s /etc/backups/automatic-backup.service \
      /etc/systemd/system/automatic-backup.service
</code></pre>
<p>
The service does nothing except start the <code>run.sh</code> shell
script.
</p>
<pre><code>[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/etc/backups/run.sh
</code></pre>
<h2 id="etc-backups-backup-disks">
<code>/etc/backups/backup.disks</code>
</h2>
<p>
The <code>run.sh</code> below runs for every external disk plugged in.
It’s important to only make backups to known backup disks, however.
</p>
<p>
The known backup disks are identified by their <code>uuid</code> in the
<code>backup.disks</code> file.
</p>
<p>
To list the disk labels and their <code>uuid</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>lsblk -o+uuid,label
</code></pre>
<p>
Add the <code>uuid</code> to the <code>/etc/backups/backup.disks</code>
file.
</p>
<p>
This is the content of the file identifying my backup disks, for
example:
</p>
<pre><code># generate using: lsblk -o+uuid,label
7c478832-5d7f-43d3-9b79-20cfc67fb0e6
bb1c034e-dd21-48e7-a496-1b95685a094d
156cf4df-aa58-421e-b3d0-583fe6fdff4a
</code></pre>
<p>
If you create your copy of the file, your uuids will be different!
</p>
<p>
When you run <code>lsblk -o+uuid,label</code> you’ll also see the device
itself. In my case, that’s <code>/dev/sdb</code>. Create a BorgBackup
repository on the new disk, mount it, create the directory and
initialize the repository.
</p>
<p>
When initializing the repository, you’re asked for a passphrase. You
will need it for the <code>run.sh</code> script.
</p>
<pre><code>mount /dev/sdb /mnt/backup
mkdir /mnt/backup/borg-backups
borg init --encryption=repokey --progress /mnt/backup/borg-backups/backup.borg
umount /mnt/backup
</code></pre>
<p>
Make sure the disk has the correct label! You can do this from the
command-line but I used
<a href="https://apps.gnome.org/en/DiskUtility/">Disks</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="etc-backups-run-sh">
<code>/etc/backups/run.sh</code>
</h2>
<p>
Now we’re ready for the actual script. It checks whether a known backup
disk is mounted under <code>/mnt/backup</code> and if so, it creates a
new archive in the repository.
</p>
<p>
Don’t forget to search for <code>BORG_PASSPHRASE</code> and change it to
whatever you used when you ran <code>borg init</code> above!
</p>
<p>
Hide the passphrase from everybody else and to make it executable:
</p>
<pre><code>chmod 0700 run.sh
</code></pre>
<p>
This the content of the shell script:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash -ue

# The udev rule is not terribly accurate and may trigger our service before
# the kernel has finished probing partitions. Sleep for a bit to ensure
# the kernel is done.
#

Check the log while the backup is being written:
</p>
<pre><code>journalctl --follow --unit automatic-backup

<p>
Make sure the backup disk is identified correctly and look at the sizes
of the archives. If they’re too small, check whether the archives
contain the right files!

<p>
<strong>2025-02-04</strong>. A reader sent me an email saying: “you may
want to call <code>borg compact</code> after <code>borg prune</code> in
order to actually free up the disk space corresponding to the pruned
archives. Otherwise your backup repo will keep growing in size.”
</p>
<p>
Good point. I think in my case it doesn’t matter because I don’t use the
disk space for anything else (and surely Borg will reuse it). But who
knows. Your situation might be different.

‘Hot Tub’, a Hardcore Porn App for iOS, Hits AltStore in the E.U.</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, updated: 2025-02-04, from: Daring Fireball</p>
<p>So, no, Apple neither approves of Hot Tub in particular, nor the
ability to distribute native porn apps in general. Everyone involved
with both AltStore and Hot Tub knows this, but they also know that
framing it as though notarization conveys approval is a good way to get
headlines.</p>

warning. As easily as Musk can turn off government websites, he can turn
off our sites. He could turn off all .com or .org sites. He’ll probably
do it just that way. Only one domain will work in the future, x.com.
Goodbye Google, Amazon, your drug store. Bubye. Not sure if moving your
DNS to Europe or Asia will make a difference. He’s taking advantage of
centralization, and will try to make it more centralized. Totally
centralized. A journalist couldn’t report this, because what proof do I
have? It’s because there’s a pattern here. And it’s pretty obvious the
tools he’s using.</p>

<p>I was just setting up an account for another Feed Reader experiment
on Bluesky and found that they have a
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Suggested+User+List%22">Suggested
User List</a> that recommended the usual people who get in the way of
telling the story that’s really happening. I had a sinking feeling in my
stomach, really felt it. We went through this with Twitter, it created
influencers based on how loyal they were to the people who run Twitter,
people who overlooked the obvious flaws in the system. We’re living with
their influence to this day, they have a million followers, completely
manufactored by fealty to the owners. I swear to god these systems have
to be publicly owned. The idea of turning to tech insiders to run them
has run its course, don’t you think. Over on Facebook this morning I saw
an old friend with a cute meme that says people should paste swastika
stickers on Teslas. That’s nice. The reason you can get away with that
is that you’re attacking innocent people. More of the same. Of course
<i>publicly owned</i> now means Musk Owned. See how things have changed,
so quickly.</p>

happening in the US is like when a person who is a lifetime smoker gets
cancer and stops smoking. You hope the cancer doesn’t kill you, and
swear to never smoke again if you’re lucky enough to survive it.
</p>
<p>
We didn’t appreciate how good we had it with our representative form of
government. We could have stopped the erosion of our power at any time,
when our reps would have more or less had to listen. Now, when we start
trying to get their attention, which hasn’t happened yet, it’s going to
be a competition between the rule of law, which is undermined, and the
forces that would keep our would-be rulers in line if only our reps felt
we were behind them, which they justifiably, do not.
</p>
<p>
The prognosis isn’t good. But we should get our shit together asap
because it’s our only hope.

<p>
PS: Blaming other people is easy and powerless. Accepting your own
responsibility and doing something to change it is powerful.

<p>
I posted a picture from our living room on fedi and noticed that the
book
<a href="https://www.celinekeller.com/who-is-afraid-of-degrowth">Who is
Afraid of Degrowth</a> by Céline Keller was visible on the coffee table.
And a bit later,
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.nz/@aimee" title="@aimee@mastodon.nz"><span
class="citation" data-cites="aimee">@aimee</span></a> shared a link to
the <a href="https://degrowth.net/">International Degrowth Network</a>,
specifically to their values and principles:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Welcome to the heart of our movement: the values and principles of
degrowth. This space explores the core ideas that drive us towards a
sustainable and equitable future, from wellbeing and community to
justice and care. As with any pluriversal movement, there are a wide
variety of values and principles, not all of which must be fulfilled at
once for something to qualify as “degrowth”. –
<a href="https://explore.degrowth.net/degrowth/values-principles/">Values
&amp; Principles: Explore degrowth</a>

<p>
Interesting
<a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/blog/we-looked-at-78-election-deepfakes-political-misinformation-is-not-an-ai-problem">analysis</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We analyzed every instance of AI use in elections collected by the WIRED
AI Elections Project
(<a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~sayashk/political-misinformation/WIRED-data.html">source</a>
for our analysis), which tracked known uses of AI for creating political
content during elections taking place in 2024 worldwide. In each case,
we identified what AI was used for and estimated the cost of creating
similar content without AI.
</p>
<p>
We find that (1) half of AI use isn’t deceptive, (2) deceptive content
produced using AI is nevertheless cheap to replicate <em>without</em>
AI, and (3) focusing on the demand for misinformation rather than the
supply is a much more effective way to diagnose problems and identify
interventions…

managing accordingly. A man is more likely to hone in on one aspect of
the problem and if they’re good, do something brilliant, but misses out
on pretty much everything else. I, as a man, have had to severely
discipline myself to get anything done, because that’s how I’m built.
Given a chance I will always put my head down and focus on one thing

<p>Imho it would be smart for Musk to stop shutting things down and just
do his work, whatever it is. By creating constant shitstorms he’s making
it impossible for anyone to defend him, and you can be sure some would
be if what he was doing wasn’t so blatantly outrageous. We never voted
for that mofo. And every American alive, whatever their preference,
thinks their own vote should count. That’s going to be a massive hurdle
for them to get over.</p>

<p>
This is yet another story of commercial spyware being
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/31/whatsapp-israel-spyware">used
against</a> journalists and civil society members.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The journalists and other civil society members were being alerted of a
possible breach of their devices, with WhatsApp telling the Guardian it
had “high confidence” that the 90 users in question had been targeted
and “possibly compromised.”
</p>
<p>
It is not clear who was behind the attack. Like other spyware makers,
Paragon’s hacking software is used by government clients and WhatsApp
said it had not been able to identify the clients who ordered the
alleged attacks…

<p>I’m 99.9% sure, as crazy as it sounds, when Musk is finished with his
software project, you will have to use X for everything related to the
government. To pay taxes, to receive health care, to renew your
passport. And if you try to arrest him, he’ll stop paying interest on
the US debt, and that will be the end of the dollar as the reserve
currency of the world. He won’t just control the US government, he will
control the world economy.</p>

I used to believe that the goal of the government should be efficiency.
If the government was more efficient (waves hands broadly in the air),
you could get rid of waste (again, waiving hands) and you’d need less
taxes, and that would trickle down (more hands) as more money in
people’s pockets, and you’d need less welfare (again, hands), less red
tape (hands), and less bureaucracy (hands, hands, hands), et cetera.
</p>
<p>
I’ve changed my thinking on the subject. I now think the goal of the
government should be to absorb inefficiencies.
</p>
<p>
As efficient as the fabled invisible hand of the market might be at
lowering the costs of goods and services
<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> and
creating
jobs<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> …
there are often non-economic inefficiencies that arise from rapidly
scaling to produce cheaper goods in the infinite money machine. Rather
than ignore those inefficiencies, I think the government should
understand the ways the system breaks and invest in longer term ideas
than making the stock market go up during the next quarter.
</p>
<p>
Here’s a short list of market inefficiencies where I think a government
helps:
</p>
<p>
<strong>Social Security and Medicare.</strong> Unpopular opinion, but I
sort of do see social security as a Ponzi scheme; younger people at the
bottom fund older people at the top who “got in first”. But you know
what’s a bigger problem? Elderly adults retiring with no retirement
plan. In our “Buy the latest iPhone” society,
<a href="https://usafacts.org/data-projects/retirement-savings">people
are statistically bad at planning for their own future</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Environment.</strong> The free market doesn’t nudge
companies towards making responsible environmental decisions. Even
though
<a href="https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2024/07/RMI-Cleantech-Revolution-pdf-1.pdf">electrification
is 3× more efficient than carbon</a>, the invisible hand is taking its
sweet time moving over to it. Probably because the invisible hand gave
too much money to the oil companies. We spend billions in aid for “once
in a lifetime” acts of God that happen every year now. The “more
efficient” act would be to kill carbon. We need a government to protect
the non-monetizable resources that give us life like oceans, lakes,
rivers, underground reservoirs, the air we breathe, and our forests.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Healthcare.</strong> I hate the American healthcare system. We
pay too much for too little. We don’t pay for healthcare, we pay for
insurance company lawyers to haggle about medical codes. Doctors hate
it. Patients hate it. Insurance companies reek of greed and corruption.
And each of us “doing our own research” isn’t a great because you end up
with people turning themselves blue from colloidal silver. We probably
need real doctors. And because most folks don’t need a doctor all the
time, we probably need health insurance. The current system is a handful
of state-by-state monopolies. But we know (according to Metcalfe’s law)
that the value of a network is proportional to the number of connected
users on the system. It would seem the best way to dodge insurance
marketplace inefficiencies like rising costs and low quality care would
be to have the biggest network possible (say, 330 million people?) to
create the best safety net. The market is not getting us the best price.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Defense.</strong> Every American owning their own personal tank
and missile system would be an inefficient stupid way to defend our
country. It’s probably best to centralize the cost of Defense and hire
trained armed service members for that purpose. I’m not advocating for
more military –I’d personally prefer less– but security is a core need
and it manifests at a nation-state level.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Transportation.</strong> I don’t think individuals should plan
and build their own highways. I’d like a government to do that. I also
think every American owning their own car that sits parked 95% of the
time is a waste of money and space, even if it does make the GDP chart
go up. You need a big extra room to store cars at home and a downtown
filled with concrete ramps to store cars at work. Or an enormous parking
lot to store cars at the store. Is this not a form of waste? There’s no
way a train makes money and is a profitable business… but more trains
equals less traffic. We know adding new
<a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2020/1/27/how-much-does-a-mile-of-road-actually-cost">ten
million dollar a mile</a> lanes to an already impossibly wide interstate
creates more traffic, more road rage, and more traffic deaths. That is
folly and an inefficiency governments can step in and solve.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Education.</strong> Education is a big expense. But you know
what’s more expensive? Everyone being stupid. That’s a joke… partially.
What is more expensive is everyone sourcing and paying for private
schools; most parents would not do it. You’d end up with a future labor
force with a lot less education. I think my biggest takeaway from school
closures during COVID was how glad I am the public education system
exists. Parents can work jobs, do commerce, and it allows kids to learn
and play with other kids from a cross-section of incomes, ethnic groups,
and special needs. The 1:20+ teacher-student ratio couldn’t be more
efficient in regards to childcare. If anything we need more teachers and
classrooms to keep that ratio as low as possible so education quality
goes up. Oh, and school breakfasts and lunches are super efficient too.
You can feed kids for like $1/kid, there’s no way I can hit those
numbers at home. I can’t believe this is contentious. Let kids eat.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Scientific Research.</strong> Space is expensive to get to, only
billionaires can afford it. Isn’t it nice that the government sometimes
foots the bill for scientists to also go? Beyond space, efforts like
curing cancer, computer research, or finding a new species of spider…
these are not an ultra-efficient use of funds but those discoveries
power innovation. The market doesn’t fund Science unless it makes money
in an A/B test. We’d end up with more patent-pending boner pills instead
of understanding of our universe. Real science is a bunch of inefficient
question and answer seeking that changes the course of human history.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Human Rights.</strong> One way to drive down costs under
Capitalism is to hire labor at the cheapest rate possible. Historically,
our great nation has relied on slaves (yikes!) and children (yikes!) for
cheap sources of labor. You’d have to work long hours for low pay and
then a machine would cut off your arm and your employer would say “Well,
you can’t work here anymore” and kick you out. Isn’t it great to have a
government to correct this moral inefficiency? It didn’t happen
overnight, of course. Countless churches and patriotic do-gooders were
fine with justifying and upholding the old system. Even fought a war
about it.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
I could keep going, but there’s a billion and one jobs a government can
do to improve the life and well-being of its citizens. Old habits die
hard, I guess, because I’m still thinking about efficiency… but from the
opposite angle. A government is perhaps best-situated to absorb
inefficiencies at scale. Will there be inefficiency and waste and
kingdom-building within a super-system like a government? For sure.
Systems should always seek to improve. To begin fixing those problems
you need data and transparency.
</p>
<p>
The more you understand Capitalism, the more you understand it’s a game.
It’s a game with an enormous exploit. I’m talking Blanka in the corner
levels of bullshit. The government <em>should</em> exist to fix those
systems and curb those bad actors. But the system continues to reward
them and heap tax break after tax break as a reward to their fellow
co-conspirators in exchange for campaign contributions and lavish trips.
Talk about inefficiency. Dumping piles of money into the hands of people
who already have money. Sheesh.

<p>Throughout now-president Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign, it was clear
that his support was coming from three very different factions whose
only shared ideology was a determination to destroy the federal
government.</p>

<p>Saw a commercial on CNN this evening from

in response to the tariffs, respectful, talking direct to Americans
about the bonds with the people of Canada. Why can’t the Dems do this,
say how important the independence of the FBI is, to start. We’d love to
pay for that. Get in the game Dems.</p>
