<h2 id="on-government-efficiency">On government efficiency</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
<tt>It‚Äôs a secret to everyone! This post is for RSS subscribers only.
<a href="https://daverupert.com/rss-club/">Read more about RSS Club</a>.
</tt>
</p>
<p>
I used to believe that the goal of the government should be efficiency.
If the government was more efficient (waves hands broadly in the air),
you could get rid of waste (again, waiving hands) and you‚Äôd need less
taxes, and that would trickle down (more hands) as more money in
people‚Äôs pockets, and you‚Äôd need less welfare (again, hands), less red
tape (hands), and less bureaucracy (hands, hands, hands), et cetera.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve changed my thinking on the subject. I now think the goal of the
government should be to absorb inefficiencies.
</p>
<p>
As efficient as the fabled invisible hand of the market might be at
lowering the costs of goods and services
<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> and
creating
jobs<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> ‚Ä¶
there are often non-economic inefficiencies that arise from rapidly
scaling to produce cheaper goods in the infinite money machine. Rather
than ignore those inefficiencies, I think the government should
understand the ways the system breaks and invest in longer term ideas
than making the stock market go up during the next quarter.
</p>
<p>
Here‚Äôs a short list of market inefficiencies where I think a government
helps:
</p>
<p>
<strong>Social Security and Medicare.</strong> Unpopular opinion, but I
sort of do see social security as a Ponzi scheme; younger people at the
bottom fund older people at the top who ‚Äúgot in first‚Äù. But you know
what‚Äôs a bigger problem? Elderly adults retiring with no retirement
plan. In our ‚ÄúBuy the latest iPhone‚Äù society,
<a href="https://usafacts.org/data-projects/retirement-savings">people
are statistically bad at planning for their own future</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Environment.</strong> The free market doesn‚Äôt nudge
companies towards making responsible environmental decisions. Even
though
<a href="https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2024/07/RMI-Cleantech-Revolution-pdf-1.pdf">electrification
is 3√ó more efficient than carbon</a>, the invisible hand is taking its
sweet time moving over to it. Probably because the invisible hand gave
too much money to the oil companies. We spend billions in aid for ‚Äúonce
in a lifetime‚Äù acts of God that happen every year now. The ‚Äúmore
efficient‚Äù act would be to kill carbon. We need a government to protect
the non-monetizable resources that give us life like oceans, lakes,
rivers, underground reservoirs, the air we breathe, and our forests.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Healthcare.</strong> I hate the American healthcare system. We
pay too much for too little. We don‚Äôt pay for healthcare, we pay for
insurance company lawyers to haggle about medical codes. Doctors hate
it. Patients hate it. Insurance companies reek of greed and corruption.
And each of us ‚Äúdoing our own research‚Äù isn‚Äôt a great because you end up
with people turning themselves blue from colloidal silver. We probably
need real doctors. And because most folks don‚Äôt need a doctor all the
time, we probably need health insurance. The current system is a handful
of state-by-state monopolies. But we know (according to Metcalfe‚Äôs law)
that the value of a network is proportional to the number of connected
users on the system. It would seem the best way to dodge insurance
marketplace inefficiencies like rising costs and low quality care would
be to have the biggest network possible (say, 330 million people?) to
create the best safety net. The market is not getting us the best price.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Defense.</strong> Every American owning their own personal tank
and missile system would be an inefficient stupid way to defend our
country. It‚Äôs probably best to centralize the cost of Defense and hire
trained armed service members for that purpose. I‚Äôm not advocating for
more military ‚ÄìI‚Äôd personally prefer less‚Äì but security is a core need
and it manifests at a nation-state level.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Transportation.</strong> I don‚Äôt think individuals should plan
and build their own highways. I‚Äôd like a government to do that. I also
think every American owning their own car that sits parked 95% of the
time is a waste of money and space, even if it does make the GDP chart
go up. You need a big extra room to store cars at home and a downtown
filled with concrete ramps to store cars at work. Or an enormous parking
lot to store cars at the store. Is this not a form of waste? There‚Äôs no
way a train makes money and is a profitable business‚Ä¶ but more trains
equals less traffic. We know adding new
<a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2020/1/27/how-much-does-a-mile-of-road-actually-cost">ten
million dollar a mile</a> lanes to an already impossibly wide interstate
creates more traffic, more road rage, and more traffic deaths. That is
folly and an inefficiency governments can step in and solve.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Education.</strong> Education is a big expense. But you know
what‚Äôs more expensive? Everyone being stupid. That‚Äôs a joke‚Ä¶ partially.
What is more expensive is everyone sourcing and paying for private
schools; most parents would not do it. You‚Äôd end up with a future labor
force with a lot less education. I think my biggest takeaway from school
closures during COVID was how glad I am the public education system
exists. Parents can work jobs, do commerce, and it allows kids to learn
and play with other kids from a cross-section of incomes, ethnic groups,
and special needs. The 1:20+ teacher-student ratio couldn‚Äôt be more
efficient in regards to childcare. If anything we need more teachers and
classrooms to keep that ratio as low as possible so education quality
goes up. Oh, and school breakfasts and lunches are super efficient too.
You can feed kids for like $1/kid, there‚Äôs no way I can hit those
numbers at home. I can‚Äôt believe this is contentious. Let kids eat.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Scientific Research.</strong> Space is expensive to get to, only
billionaires can afford it. Isn‚Äôt it nice that the government sometimes
foots the bill for scientists to also go? Beyond space, efforts like
curing cancer, computer research, or finding a new species of spider‚Ä¶
these are not an ultra-efficient use of funds but those discoveries
power innovation. The market doesn‚Äôt fund Science unless it makes money
in an A/B test. We‚Äôd end up with more patent-pending boner pills instead
of understanding of our universe. Real science is a bunch of inefficient
question and answer seeking that changes the course of human history.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Human Rights.</strong> One way to drive down costs under
Capitalism is to hire labor at the cheapest rate possible. Historically,
our great nation has relied on slaves (yikes!) and children (yikes!) for
cheap sources of labor. You‚Äôd have to work long hours for low pay and
then a machine would cut off your arm and your employer would say ‚ÄúWell,
you can‚Äôt work here anymore‚Äù and kick you out. Isn‚Äôt it great to have a
government to correct this moral inefficiency? It didn‚Äôt happen
overnight, of course. Countless churches and patriotic do-gooders were
fine with justifying and upholding the old system. Even fought a war
about it.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
I could keep going, but there‚Äôs a billion and one jobs a government can
do to improve the life and well-being of its citizens. Old habits die
hard, I guess, because I‚Äôm still thinking about efficiency‚Ä¶ but from the
opposite angle. A government is perhaps best-situated to absorb
inefficiencies at scale. Will there be inefficiency and waste and
kingdom-building within a super-system like a government? For sure.
Systems should always seek to improve. To begin fixing those problems
you need data and transparency.
</p>
<p>
The more you understand Capitalism, the more you understand it‚Äôs a game.
It‚Äôs a game with an enormous exploit. I‚Äôm talking Blanka in the corner
levels of bullshit. The government <em>should</em> exist to fix those
systems and curb those bad actors. But the system continues to reward
them and heap tax break after tax break as a reward to their fellow
co-conspirators in exchange for campaign contributions and lavish trips.
Talk about inefficiency. Dumping piles of money into the hands of people
who already have money. Sheesh.

pay for that. Get in the game Dems.</p>
