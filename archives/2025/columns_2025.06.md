**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-02-16, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

BTW, no one thought much about the threading structure we use on Bluesky. As far as I can tell it was copied from Twitter. It's not a very good structure. It encourages spam and abuse. You gotta wonder if the threading structure had evolved, or if there were more competition, different approaches to see what would happen, we might have avoided our meltdown with a better design.

Great quote from a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=severance+s2e5">favorite show</a>. "He put the dick in contradiction." This is a show that doesn't often indulge in that kind of humor. I imagine they must've had a great time with it in the writer's room. Or was it ad-lib'd? And wtf does it mean?

I sure do. It has never happened before. But it has happened now, and the group that is governing is doing it illegally, and is dismantling the country as quickly as they can, assuming someone will at some point try to stop them? Is that correct? What comes next?

## OpenSSL does a QUIC API

date: 2025-02-16, from: Daniel Stenberg Blog

But will it satisfy the world? I have blogged several times in the past about how OpenSSL decided to not ship the API for QUIC a long time ago, even though the entire HTTP world was hoping for it &#8211; or even expecting it. OpenSSL rejected the proposal to merge the proposed API and thereby &#8230; <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/02/16/openssl-does-a-quic-api/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">OpenSSL does a QUIC API</span> <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>

I’m not giving money to Democrats. I will give to campaigns that run hard-hitting ads telling the full truth about what Musk is doing now. I want to see the actual ads before I chip in, and will do so enthusiastically, but they can’t be anemic.

## The web before the web

<p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@vga256@dialup.cafe/114004725458799557">Hypercard</a> stacks were the equivalent of websites. </p>
<p>If <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard">it</a> had been built around the Macintosh Toolkit, and had an API that fit in with Mac apps, there wouldn't be a web, we'd all be using Macs. Alas it was all on its own, didn't work with anything but itself. </p>
<p>A lot was lost because the Mac development model was far in advance of what existed on the web, and it was well-thought-out unlike the app model of the web, which is a hodgepodge of horribly designed modules that don't work well together. </p>
<p>I was a Mac developer at the time, so I know a lot about this moment of history. </p>

## Indie’s First Library Trip

date: 2025-02-15, from: Jessica Smith's blog

<p>The first big autumnal blast of the year has hit. We took Indie on her first trip to the local library (where she gave the most ENORMOUS grin to the librarian, it was really sweet), craving more diversity in books than &ldquo;Colours&rdquo;, &ldquo;Shapes&rdquo; and the ever-frustrating &ldquo;Goodnight Stories for Rebel Girls&rdquo;. This was our haul…</p>

<p>The Plato one was funny. The back indicated there was another in the series called &ldquo;Equality with Simone de Beauvoir&rdquo;, so I went, &ldquo;Ooh, well if they have it, I&rsquo;d rather get that one.&rdquo; They didn&rsquo;t have it. So I turned to Indie and said, &ldquo;Well, we can get the Plato one, and you can listen to me trash-talk him!&rdquo; Then Viv (Philosophy major – not that you&rsquo;d ever know by just meeting him) asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with Plato?&rdquo; and I explained my opinion.</p>
<p>But anyway, the book is called <cite>Love with Plato</cite>. So I was like, &ldquo;What did Plato even say about love? I don&rsquo;t remember that from year 12 Philosophy. I remember PHILOSOPHER-KINGS and the allegory of the cave…&rdquo; Just from reading the book now, it seems like Plato said it&rsquo;s good to love things. So, OK, Plato. Thanks for that brilliant insight. (This is me expecting too much out of baby books again, isn&rsquo;t it?)</p>

<p>And this was one of the books we did NOT get. I pointed it out to Viv and went, &ldquo;Oh man, what is this, pro-cop propaganda for babies?! Get it out of here,&rdquo; and Viv started teasing me: &ldquo;Come on, the police are lovely people. Who else are you going to call when you need the police?&rdquo; and I told him to stop brainwashing the baby.</p>
<p>We had a nice little excursion, anyway.</p>

I get it. That's what it feels like to be in a Silicon Valley company that has been acquired by another Silicon Valley company, a subject I <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/12/140926.html">wrote about</a> on Wednesday. I wish there was some way for us to communicate with each other about this, because I'm sure my description comes closer to the way Musk sees it, though they are very similar ideas. One of the defects of the social web is that we live in little bubbles and not much information is exchanged over bubble boundaries. So if anyone knows Applebaum, please send her a link to this post.

## AI and Civil Service Purges

date: 2025-02-14, updated: 2025-02-13, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Donald Trump and Elon Musk&#8217;s chaotic approach to reform is upending government operations. Critical functions have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/05/musk-doge-takeover-usaid">halted</a>, tens of thousands of federal staffers are being encouraged to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/federal-workers-accept-buyout-offers-be1c00fb">resign</a>, and congressional mandates are being <a href="https://thehill.com/business/5124133-democrats-bill-treasury-system-musk/">disregarded</a>. The next phase: The Department of Government Efficiency <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/technology/musk-allies-ai-government.html">reportedly</a> wants to use AI to cut costs. According to <em>The Washington Post</em>, Musk&#8217;s group has started to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/06/elon-musk-doge-ai-department-education/">run sensitive data</a> from government systems through AI programs to analyze spending and determine what could be pruned. This may lead to the elimination of human jobs in favor of automation. As one government official who has been tracking Musk&#8217;s DOGE team told the...</p>

Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2-Xbn92mXE">two-minute demo</a> of my new writing tool for Bluesky. This is quite a bit simpler than the last version, you log on directly to Bluesky, doesn't go through my server at all. This removes a whole layer of complexity for the user, and means a lot of people can use it without it having to scale up. Also made it simpler, more of a writing tool, closer to where I'd like this stuff to be when we have across-the-board textcasting support. Really focused on the flow for writers.

I got rid of Linkedin because I never use it. Added Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads. Debated whether to remove Twitter, but it is still a way to follow my posts, the ones that go out through the linkblog. A lot of people still use Twitter. Had to include the latest version of Font-Awesome, but since my story pages don't otherwise use FA, I figured nothing could break. Haha. ;-)

## 2025-02-07 I bought some tea

date: 2025-02-13, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-02-07-i-bought-some-tea">2025-02-07 I bought some tea</h1>

<p>I buy tea about once a year. I also buy a lot of coffee but I have never compared the two. Probably a mistake. At one point I weighed the coffee beans for my Mokka pot and got 17g. I make two of these per day. That’s about 12.5kg per year and probably costs CHF 250.- per year, plus coffee in coffee houses and restaurants.</p>

<p>Anyway, taking pictures of the labels with my phone, relying on the optical character recognition so I can copy and paste this into <a class="account" href="https://social.tchncs.de/@babelcarp" title="@babelcarp@social.tchncs.de">@babelcarp</a>’s <a href="http://www.panix.com/~perin/babelcarp/">Babel Carp</a>, “a Chinese Tea Lexicon”, and reading the entriss is how I also spend extra time with the tea.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ye Lai Xiang (50g / CHF 41.50), <a href="https://www.panix.com/~perin/babelcarp/babelcarp.cgi?phrase=%E5%87%A4%E5%87%B0%E5%8D%95%E4%B8%9B&amp;define=1">凤凰单丛</a>, Phoenix Single Bush, descended from Shuixian trees growing in Fenghuanshan, i.e., the Phoenix Mountains in Chao An, called 夜来香 or Nocturnal Fragrance, maybe due to roasting over lychee wood (although last time I bought it wasn’t nearly as strong as I remembered I still want back that lychee fragrance)</li>
<li>Ya Shi Xiang Dong Pian (50g / CHF 55.00), another 凤凰单丛, this one being <a href="https://www.panix.com/~perin/babelcarp/babelcarp.cgi?phrase=%E9%B8%AD%E5%B1%8E%E9%A6%99%E5%86%AC%E7%89%87&amp;define=1">鸭屎香冬片</a> or “Smells Like Duck Shit” – this is confusing! – from Taiwan</li>
<li>Gang Kou Cha Meer Oolong (100g / CHF 55.00), <a href="http://www.panix.com/~perin/babelcarp/babelcarp.cgi?phrase=%E6%B8%AF%E5%8F%A3%E8%8C%B6&amp;define=1">港口茶</a>, harbour tea from Pingtung in Taiwan</li>
<li>Jinggu 2016 ( 357g / CHF 180.00), <a href="https://www.panix.com/~perin/babelcarp/babelcarp.cgi?phrase=%E6%99%AE%E6%B4%B1%E7%94%9F%E9%A5%BC%E5%8F%A4%E6%A0%91%E8%8C%B6&amp;define=1">普洱生饼古树茶</a>, Pu Er Shen Bing Gu Shu Cha, i.e., raw Pu Er from old trees in 景谷, Jinggu; this one is the cheapest I could get, being neither from the east nor west of the Mekong river from from further north; they had cakes from 2015 up to 2024, all at the same price, and I didn’t know which ones to pick so I picked an older one – was this a good choice?</li>
<li>Jin Jiang Hui Ming (50g / CHF 40.00), <a href="https://www.panix.com/~perin/babelcarp/babelcarp.cgi?phrase=%E9%87%91%E5%A5%96%E6%83%A0%E6%98%8E&amp;define=1">金奖惠明</a>, green tea  grown by the She Zu; it got a gold medal in 1915! 😄 Huiming is the name of a local temple</li>
<li>Tama Ryokucha Hinpyoukai (50g / CHF 35.00), kept under shade for three weeks, giving it a gyokuro sencha touch, From Ureshino, Saga. This is the Tsuyuhikari plant variety.</li>
<li>Gen Mai Bancha (125g / CHF 17.50)</li>
<li>Hojicha (70g / CHF 13.50)</li>
<li>Shincha Yame (100g / CHF 40.00)</li>
<li>Sencha Hoshino (50g / CHF 42.50)</li>
</ul>

<p>Some everyday tea like Genmaicha and Hojicha; some Sencha; some green tea from China, and a Pu Er cake. I am an absolutely clueless buyer of tea and essentially I just know that my price range goes up to around CHF 60.-/50g.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in my hubris I wrote <a href="2024-10-22-chinese-tea">preparing Chinese tea for beginners</a>. In a way, I feel like you can’t do this journey all in one go, so I wrote what I thought was important to me when I got started and I’m hoping to read more from people further along.</p>

<p>Let me know if you have books or articles to recommend.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Tea">#Tea</a></p>

<p><strong>2025-02-10</strong>. The Tama Ryokucha Hinpyoukai is intense! 😍</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-02-07-tea-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>2025-02-13</strong>. The Jin Jiang Hui Ming is very nice. Floral umami. It looks surprisingly light.</p>

<p>In the span of just weeks, the US government has experienced what may be the most consequential security breach in its history&#8212;not through a sophisticated cyberattack or an act of foreign espionage, but through official orders by a billionaire with a poorly defined government role. And the implications for national security are profound.</p>
<p>First, it was reported that people associated with the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) had <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wyden.senate.gov/post/3lh5ejpwncc23">accessed</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-federal-payments-system.html">the</a> <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/elon-musk-doge-treasury-access-federal-payments.html">US</a> <a href="https://therecord.media/union-groups-sue-treasury-over-giving-doge-access-to-data">Treasury</a> computer system, giving them the ability to collect data on and potentially control the department&#8217;s roughly ...</p>

## The United States is not a Silicon Valley company

date: 2025-02-12, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I've had an experience few people have had, and it's relevant to the way all of us feel right now. The experience: Being part of a Silicon Valley company that was acquired by another Silicon Valley company. I was the CEO. </p>
<p>I recognize the feeling, because Musk is acting as if he is the acquirer of a Silicon Valley company, and the company he has acquired in the USA. Or so he thinks. But the United States is not a Silicon Valley company where, you have departments and managers at every level, and each level must follow orders from the level above them. It doesn't work that way here. Deliberately. Very deliberately. </p>
<p>There never has been a Silicon Valley company that gives each employee the rights and responsibilities of an American citizen. We don't take orders except in very exceptional circumstances, and then with all the rights guaranteed by the Constitution. That's why Musk and Trump are having so much trouble coming to grips with how this place works, because even the employees of the USA are voters and taxpayers and have rights that must be respected. That <i>will</i> be respected or all hell will break loose. </p>
<p>Anyway, back to Silicon Valley acquisitions. Up to the point when you, the former CEO, are now a VP, and must take orders from the CEO, you didn't have to take orders from anyone, not even your board of directors. The CEO of the tech company is a lot like a citizen of the US, until they aren't a CEO any longer and have to do the bidding of the actual CEO (which is who Musk thinks he is relative to the USA). This is why even MAGAs who love Trump (or really the idea of Trump) aren't going to put up with his bullshit. American citizens, rich or poor, old or young, LBGTQ or whatever -- we all are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state">sovereign</a>, ie we don't have to take orders from anyone, not even a supposed genius like Musk (sorry, but I am free to doubt his genius, something might take some getting used to by him). We don't take orders from him, or anyone else, except of course, as mentioned earlier under very special circumstances. </p>
<p>Back to the disconnect in the Mind of Musk. Now you're supposed to sit here, quietly, while he rips apart the team you carefully built, the people you formed into a family with all its strengths and dysfunction. The new CEO (Musk) sweeps in with no idea what they're fucking with, and they don't want to hear about it. Finally you have to quit after a short time because you can't be part of the disaster they're creating. And always is a disaster, and sometimes they can dig out of it as he has done with Twitter, as we've seen many SV companies have. But again, for the 18th time, <i>the United States of America is not a Silicon Valley company.</i></p>
<p>What triggered it for me was the story about how Musk didn't know he had terminated all cancer research being done by the US. Surrounded by yes men, they never would have told him. And he didn't want to hear it from a founder (like a congressperson or the head of the NIH or the acting Treasury secretary). This is going to be repeated over and over until the acquirer writes off the investment or who knows. His experience comes from acquiring Tesla and Twitter, which while they were large organizations are nothing compared with the United States. </p>
<p>And ultimately the United States is going to chew up Musk and spit him out. We may be very damaged by the experience, but he will come out much worse than the country. Because we are not who he thinks we are. </p>

## Delivering Malware Through Abandoned Amazon S3 Buckets

date: 2025-02-12, updated: 2025-02-12, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://labs.watchtowr.com/8-million-requests-later-we-made-the-solarwinds-supply-chain-attack-look-amateur/">supply-chain attack</a> just waiting to happen. A group of researchers searched for, and then registered, abandoned Amazon S3 buckets for about $400. These buckets contained software libraries that are still used. Presumably the projects don&#8217;t realize that they have been abandoned, and still ping them for patches, updates, and etc.</p>
<blockquote><p>The TL;DR is that this time, we ended up discovering ~150 Amazon S3 buckets that had previously been used across commercial and open source software products, governments, and infrastructure deployment/update pipelines&#8212;and then abandoned...</p></blockquote>

<p>Recently I've been <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews/issues/65">testing a SiFive HiFive Premier P550</a>, and as part of that testing, I <em>of course</em> plugged in some AMD GPUs I had laying around.</p>

<p>I'll get to that testing at a later date, but one thing I enjoy in my testing is finding what 3D accelerated games and other applications can be run on alternative architectures. With the great work from Wine and Proton over the years, a great many games run out of the box on Linux—and they can be made to run on Arm and RISC-V architectures with almost as much ease as Linux on X86/AMD64!</p>

date: 2025-02-11, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>First, the <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/191367/trump-treasury-default-bond-market">New Republic</a> is beginning to think like Musk and Trump. But they have to think a bit more and ask how does this all tie together? </p>
<p>Remember you have to consider events that would normally be unthinkable. And believe that Trump isn't actually president of the United States in any sense of what that meant in the past. He is sitting in the seat of the president. He has the powers of the president, but he does not represent the interests of the United States. </p>
<p>He's going to use the US Treasury and the power of the dollar as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#:~:text=A%20reserve%20currency%20is%20a,of%20their%20foreign%20exchange%20reserves.">reserve currency</a>, to buy himself a few toys to play with, like Canada, Greenland, Gaza and Panama, to start. </p>
<p>To illustrate, here's the text of an imaginary conversation between Trump and Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada. </p>
<ul>
<li>Trump: Hey Justin, how's it going?</li>
<li>Trudeau: You know, not so good.</li>
<li>Trump: I get it. Have you considered my offer?</li>
<li>Trudeau: Yes. Either we surrender and become the 51st state, or you won't honor Canadian deposits in the US Treasury. </li>
<li>Trump: That's right my friend.</li>
<li>Trudeau: I don't see how we have any choice.</li>
<li>Trump: I'm afraid that's correct. </li>
<li>Trudeau: Semi-sarcastic: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and Canada. </li>
<li>Trump: You can leave out the Canada part. </li>
<li>Trudeau: You can't blame me for trying.</li>
<li>Trump: Have a nice day. 😀</li>
</ul>
<p>And then this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4nYgfV2oJA&t=130s">scene from Goodfellas</a> demonstrates what's next for the former independent country of Canada. </p>

As soon as President Donald Trump took office, his administration froze great swaths of government funding, apparently to test the theory popular with Project 2025 authors that the 1974 law forbidding the president from &#8220;impounding&#8221; money Congress had appropriated was unconstitutional.

I'm not sure whether to laugh or cry over this:Federal judges have issued President Donald Trump
 stinging legal rebukes in the early clashes over his blitz of executive
 orders, and two of his top aides have responded by suggesting that his 
administration defy the courts and move forward with its agenda.There’s no indication that Trump has adopted such a strategy, although a U.S. judge in Rhode

<p>It was remarkable watching the SuperBowl last night, you could conclude everything is normal. It’s not.

## Musk roots the world economy

date: 2025-02-10, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>First, that's just a theory, but I need to get your attention. </p>
<p>Rooting a computer means you own it. You have superuser powers. You can do anything, install or uninstall anything.</p>
<p>Mostly journalism has been reporting "He has our social security numbers." Sigh. That's not nearly the problem folks.</p>
<p>With root access on the financial computers of the US, you can delete debt. Trump <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-suggests-us-may-have-less-debt-than-thought-because-fraud">threatened</a> to do that last night, in a really menacing way. They are smart fellows those guys. </p>
<p>You want to destroy the world economy? Start deleting records of debt to the US treasury. Ask an economist if you don't believe me.</p>
<p>More likely is they want to hold the world economy hostage, and then they will take their demands of Gaza and Canada more seriously. It's clever because it doesn't require soldiers, not one shot will be fired. My guess is that they already have this power. </p>
<p>BTW, here's SQL code that randomly deletes 1 in 5 records in a table named inventory. </p>
<ul>
<li><code>delete from inventory where rand () < 0.2;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Run that command on the debt of the United States, and voila, the greatest depression ever.</p>
<p>You don't have to be a math wiz to come up with that, btw. You can <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67aa0be8-91f0-8012-987f-89d8b8edba21">ask ChatGPT</a>. And before you blame ChatGPT this would be an early exercise in a textbook on SQL programming.</p>
<p>Deleting the debt would be like trying to withdraw money from your account at a bank and them saying they have no record of you having an account. The US treasury is basically the root bank of the entire world economy. It's where people store their money.  </p>

## Pairwise Authentication of Humans

date: 2025-02-10, updated: 2025-02-10, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Here&#8217;s an <a href="https://ksze.github.io/PeerAuth/">easy</a> system for two humans to remotely authenticate to each other, so they can be sure that neither are digital impersonations.</p>
<blockquote><p>To mitigate that risk, I have developed this simple solution where you can setup a unique time-based one-time passcode (TOTP) between any pair of persons.</p>
<p>This is how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Two people, Person A and Person B, sit in front of the same computer and open this page;
<li>They input their respective names (e.g. Alice and Bob) onto the same page, and click &#8220;Generate&#8221;;
<li>The page will generate two TOTP QR codes, one for Alice and one for Bob;
...</li></li></li></ol></blockquote>

This quote pretty much sums up what happens to successful people as they grow older. They lose the ability to risk it all. The more successful they are, the more they want to protect what they have. You go from being a creator to a protector/hoarder. One doesn&#8217;t have to look too far &#8212; those &#8230;

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/04/24/cheshireCat.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I'm still fixing bugs in the <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/08/214503.html">new Bluesky feature</a> I wrote about yesterday. If the URL of an image has search args, I wasn't getting the type correct and Bluesky rejected it. I used a post about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz's</a> statue unveiled in San Francisco <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2025/02/08/aaron-swartz-marble-statue-unveiled-internet-archive/">yesterday</a> to test the fix. I knew Aaron of course, he was part of the group developing <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> in the early 00s. He went on to do other things, as did I, and I met up with him again in NYC in the early teens, and then a few months or a year or two (I don't have the exact date of the meetup) he commited <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/technology/aaron-swartz-internet-activist-dies-at-26.html">suicide</a>. It was a real shock. Now, many years later -- a statue. And the <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/aa1a8beacf79d90bc26105ba46c32072">random snarky slogan</a> my test script picked out was really <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/02/09/aaronScreenshot.png">appropriate</a> to the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bighugga.bsky.social/post/3lhqslgshmt2c">event</a>. It was a tragedy, because an older more confident Aaron would have made a big contribution. I often think about that.
