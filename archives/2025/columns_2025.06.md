## More than death panels

<p>Musk will defund Medicare. </p>
<p>More than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_panel">death panels</a>. </p>
<p>Say goodbye to everyone who needs health care</p>
<p>Because almost no one can afford it without coverage.</p>

I get it. That's what it feels like to be in a Silicon Valley company that has been acquired by another Silicon Valley company, a subject I <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/02/12/140926.html">wrote about</a> on Wednesday. I wish there was some way for us to communicate with each other about this, because I'm sure my description comes closer to the way Musk sees it, though they are very similar ideas. One of the defects of the social web is that we live in little bubbles and not much information is exchanged over bubble boundaries. So if anyone knows Applebaum, please send her a link to this post. Thanks.

## AI and Civil Service Purges

date: 2025-02-14, updated: 2025-02-13, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Donald Trump and Elon Musk&#8217;s chaotic approach to reform is upending government operations. Critical functions have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/05/musk-doge-takeover-usaid">halted</a>, tens of thousands of federal staffers are being encouraged to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/federal-workers-accept-buyout-offers-be1c00fb">resign</a>, and congressional mandates are being <a href="https://thehill.com/business/5124133-democrats-bill-treasury-system-musk/">disregarded</a>. The next phase: The Department of Government Efficiency <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/03/technology/musk-allies-ai-government.html">reportedly</a> wants to use AI to cut costs. According to <em>The Washington Post</em>, Musk&#8217;s group has started to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/06/elon-musk-doge-ai-department-education/">run sensitive data</a> from government systems through AI programs to analyze spending and determine what could be pruned. This may lead to the elimination of human jobs in favor of automation. As one government official who has been tracking Musk&#8217;s DOGE team told the...</p>

Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2-Xbn92mXE">two-minute demo</a> of my new writing tool for Bluesky. This is quite a bit simpler than the last version, you log on directly to Bluesky, doesn't go through my server at all. This removes a whole layer of complexity for the user, and means a lot of people can use it without it having to scale up. Also made it simpler, more of a writing tool, closer to where I'd like this stuff to be when we have across-the-board textcasting support. Really focused on the flow for writers.

Re-did the social media links at the bottom of each story page. <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/02/13/socialMediaLinks.png">Screen shot</a>. Used to be just RSS and Linkedin. I got rid of Linkedin because I never use it. Added Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads. Debated whether to remove Twitter, but it is still a way to follow my posts, the ones that go out through the linkblog. A lot of people still use Twitter. Had to include the latest version of Font-Awesome, but since my story pages don't otherwise use FA, I figured nothing could break. Haha. ;-)

## 2025-02-07 I bought some tea

date: 2025-02-13, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-02-07-i-bought-some-tea">2025-02-07 I bought some tea</h1>

<p>I buy tea about once a year. I also buy a lot of coffee but I have never compared the two. Probably a mistake. At one point I weighed the coffee beans for my Mokka pot and got 17g. I make two of these per day. That’s about 12.5kg per year and probably costs CHF 250.- per year, plus coffee in coffee houses and restaurants.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ye Lai Xiang (50g / CHF 41.50), <a href="https://www.panix.com/~perin/babelcarp/babelcarp.cgi?phrase=%E5%87%A4%E5%87%B0%E5%8D%95%E4%B8%9B&amp;define=1">凤凰单丛</a>, Phoenix Single Bush, descended from Shuixian trees growing in Fenghuanshan, i.e., the Phoenix Mountains in Chao An, called 夜来香 or Nocturnal Fragrance, maybe due to roasting over lychee wood (although last time I bought it wasn’t nearly as strong as I remembered I still want back that lychee fragrance)</li>
<li>Ya Shi Xiang Dong Pian (50g / CHF 55.00), another 凤凰单丛, this one being <a href="https://www.panix.com/~perin/babelcarp/babelcarp.cgi?phrase=%E9%B8%AD%E5%B1%8E%E9%A6%99%E5%86%AC%E7%89%87&amp;define=1">鸭屎香冬片</a> or “Smells Like Duck Shit” – this is confusing! – from Taiwan</li>

<li>Jin Jiang Hui Ming (50g / CHF 40.00), <a href="https://www.panix.com/~perin/babelcarp/babelcarp.cgi?phrase=%E9%87%91%E5%A5%96%E6%83%A0%E6%98%8E&amp;define=1">金奖惠明</a>, green tea  grown by the She Zu; it got a gold medal in 1915! 😄 Huiming is the name of a local temple</li>

<p>Some everyday tea like Genmaicha and Hojicha; some Sencha; some green tea from China, and a Pu Er cake. I am an absolutely clueless buyer of tea and essentially I just know that my price range goes up to around CHF 60.-/50g.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in my hubris I wrote <a href="2024-10-22-chinese-tea">preparing Chinese tea for beginners</a>. In a way, I feel like you can’t do this journey all in one go, so I wrote what I thought was important to me when I got started and I’m hoping to read more from people further along.</p>

## DOGE as a National Cyberattack

date: 2025-02-13, updated: 2025-02-14, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>In the span of just weeks, the US government has experienced what may be the most consequential security breach in its history&#8212;not through a sophisticated cyberattack or an act of foreign espionage, but through official orders by a billionaire with a poorly defined government role. And the implications for national security are profound.</p>
<p>First, it was reported that people associated with the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) had <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wyden.senate.gov/post/3lh5ejpwncc23">accessed</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-federal-payments-system.html">the</a> <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/elon-musk-doge-treasury-access-federal-payments.html">US</a> <a href="https://therecord.media/union-groups-sue-treasury-over-giving-doge-access-to-data">Treasury</a> computer system, giving them the ability to collect data on and potentially control the department&#8217;s roughly ...</p>

## The United States is not a Silicon Valley company

date: 2025-02-12, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I've had an experience few people have had, and it's relevant to the way all of us feel right now. The experience: Being part of a Silicon Valley company that was acquired by another Silicon Valley company. I was the CEO. </p>
<p>I recognize the feeling, because Musk is acting as if he is the acquirer of a Silicon Valley company, and the company he has acquired in the USA. Or so he thinks. But the United States is not a Silicon Valley company where, you have departments and managers at every level, and each level must follow orders from the level above them. It doesn't work that way here. Deliberately. Very deliberately. </p>
<p>There never has been a Silicon Valley company that gives each employee the rights and responsibilities of an American citizen. We don't take orders except in very exceptional circumstances, and then with all the rights guaranteed by the Constitution. That's why Musk and Trump are having so much trouble coming to grips with how this place works, because even the employees of the USA are voters and taxpayers and have rights that must be respected. That <i>will</i> be respected or all hell will break loose. </p>
<p>Anyway, back to Silicon Valley acquisitions. Up to the point when you, the former CEO, are now a VP, and must take orders from the CEO, you didn't have to take orders from anyone, not even your board of directors. The CEO of the tech company is a lot like a citizen of the US, until they aren't a CEO any longer and have to do the bidding of the actual CEO (which is who Musk thinks he is relative to the USA). This is why even MAGAs who love Trump (or really the idea of Trump) aren't going to put up with his bullshit. American citizens, rich or poor, old or young, LBGTQ or whatever -- we all are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state">sovereign</a>, ie we don't have to take orders from anyone, not even a supposed genius like Musk (sorry, but I am free to doubt his genius, something might take some getting used to by him). We don't take orders from him, or anyone else, except of course, as mentioned earlier under very special circumstances. </p>
<p>Back to the disconnect in the Mind of Musk. Now you're supposed to sit here, quietly, while he rips apart the team you carefully built, the people you formed into a family with all its strengths and dysfunction. The new CEO (Musk) sweeps in with no idea what they're fucking with, and they don't want to hear about it. Finally you have to quit after a short time because you can't be part of the disaster they're creating. And always is a disaster, and sometimes they can dig out of it as he has done with Twitter, as we've seen many SV companies have. But again, for the 18th time, <i>the United States of America is not a Silicon Valley company.</i></p>
<p>What triggered it for me was the story about how Musk didn't know he had terminated all cancer research being done by the US. Surrounded by yes men, they never would have told him. And he didn't want to hear it from a founder (like a congressperson or the head of the NIH or the acting Treasury secretary). This is going to be repeated over and over until the acquirer writes off the investment or who knows. His experience comes from acquiring Tesla and Twitter, which while they were large organizations are nothing compared with the United States. </p>
<p>And ultimately the United States is going to chew up Musk and spit him out. We may be very damaged by the experience, but he will come out much worse than the country. Because we are not who he thinks we are. </p>

## Delivering Malware Through Abandoned Amazon S3 Buckets

date: 2025-02-12, updated: 2025-02-12, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://labs.watchtowr.com/8-million-requests-later-we-made-the-solarwinds-supply-chain-attack-look-amateur/">supply-chain attack</a> just waiting to happen. A group of researchers searched for, and then registered, abandoned Amazon S3 buckets for about $400. These buckets contained software libraries that are still used. Presumably the projects don&#8217;t realize that they have been abandoned, and still ping them for patches, updates, and etc.</p>
<blockquote><p>The TL;DR is that this time, we ended up discovering ~150 Amazon S3 buckets that had previously been used across commercial and open source software products, governments, and infrastructure deployment/update pipelines&#8212;and then abandoned...</p></blockquote>

## Build Box64 with Box32 for X86 emulation on RISC-V Linux

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Build Box64 with Box32 for X86 emulation on RISC-V Linux</span>

            <p></p>

<p>Recently I've been <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews/issues/65">testing a SiFive HiFive Premier P550</a>, and as part of that testing, I <em>of course</em> plugged in some AMD GPUs I had laying around.</p>

<p>I'll get to that testing at a later date, but one thing I enjoy in my testing is finding what 3D accelerated games and other applications can be run on alternative architectures. With the great work from Wine and Proton over the years, a great many games run out of the box on Linux—and they can be made to run on Arm and RISC-V architectures with almost as much ease as Linux on X86/AMD64!</p>

## Trump and Trudeau chat

date: 2025-02-11, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>First, the <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/191367/trump-treasury-default-bond-market">New Republic</a> is beginning to think like Musk and Trump. But they have to think a bit more and ask how does this all tie together? </p>
<p>Remember you have to consider events that would normally be unthinkable. And believe that Trump isn't actually president of the United States in any sense of what that meant in the past. He is sitting in the seat of the president. He has the powers of the president, but he does not represent the interests of the United States. </p>
<p>He's going to use the US Treasury and the power of the dollar as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#:~:text=A%20reserve%20currency%20is%20a,of%20their%20foreign%20exchange%20reserves.">reserve currency</a>, to buy himself a few toys to play with, like Canada, Greenland, Gaza and Panama, to start. </p>
<p>To illustrate, here's the text of an imaginary conversation between Trump and Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada. </p>
<ul>
<li>Trump: Hey Justin, how's it going?</li>
<li>Trudeau: You know, not so good.</li>
<li>Trump: I get it. Have you considered my offer?</li>
<li>Trudeau: Yes. Either we surrender and become the 51st state, or you won't honor Canadian deposits in the US Treasury. </li>
<li>Trump: That's right my friend.</li>
<li>Trudeau: I don't see how we have any choice.</li>
<li>Trump: I'm afraid that's correct. </li>
<li>Trudeau: Semi-sarcastic: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and Canada. </li>
<li>Trump: You can leave out the Canada part. </li>
<li>Trudeau: You can't blame me for trying.</li>
<li>Trump: Have a nice day. 😀</li>
</ul>
<p>And then this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4nYgfV2oJA&t=130s">scene from Goodfellas</a> demonstrates what's next for the former independent country of Canada. </p>

## Musk roots the world economy

date: 2025-02-10, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>First, that's just a theory, but I need to get your attention. </p>
<p>Rooting a computer means you own it. You have superuser powers. You can do anything, install or uninstall anything.</p>
<p>Mostly journalism has been reporting "He has our social security numbers." Sigh. That's not nearly the problem folks.</p>
<p>With root access on the financial computers of the US, you can delete debt. Trump <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-suggests-us-may-have-less-debt-than-thought-because-fraud">threatened</a> to do that last night, in a really menacing way. They are smart fellows those guys. </p>
<p>You want to destroy the world economy? Start deleting records of debt to the US treasury. Ask an economist if you don't believe me.</p>
<p>More likely is they want to hold the world economy hostage, and then they will take their demands of Gaza and Canada more seriously. It's clever because it doesn't require soldiers, not one shot will be fired. My guess is that they already have this power. </p>
<p>BTW, here's SQL code that randomly deletes 1 in 5 records in a table named inventory. </p>
<ul>
<li><code>delete from inventory where rand () < 0.2;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Run that command on the debt of the United States, and voila, the greatest depression ever.</p>
<p>You don't have to be a math wiz to come up with that, btw. You can <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67aa0be8-91f0-8012-987f-89d8b8edba21">ask ChatGPT</a>. And before you blame ChatGPT this would be an early exercise in a textbook on SQL programming.</p>
<p>Deleting the debt would be like trying to withdraw money from your account at a bank and them saying they have no record of you having an account. The US treasury is basically the root bank of the entire world economy. It's where people store their money.  </p>

## Pairwise Authentication of Humans

date: 2025-02-10, updated: 2025-02-10, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Here&#8217;s an <a href="https://ksze.github.io/PeerAuth/">easy</a> system for two humans to remotely authenticate to each other, so they can be sure that neither are digital impersonations.</p>
<blockquote><p>To mitigate that risk, I have developed this simple solution where you can setup a unique time-based one-time passcode (TOTP) between any pair of persons.</p>
<p>This is how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Two people, Person A and Person B, sit in front of the same computer and open this page;
<li>They input their respective names (e.g. Alice and Bob) onto the same page, and click &#8220;Generate&#8221;;
<li>The page will generate two TOTP QR codes, one for Alice and one for Bob;
...</li></li></li></ol></blockquote>

## Fire and Rain

date: 2025-02-09, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

Twenty-fifth in the News Commons series Southern California has two seasons: Fire and Rain. Rain didn&#8217;t begin this year until a few days after Fire ended apocalyptically, incinerating much of Altadena and Pacific Palisades. Now Rain is here, with the occasional atmospheric river flowing across the faces of hills and mountains whose beards were just [&#8230;]

## Risk Aversion

date: 2025-02-09, from: Om Malik blog

This quote pretty much sums up what happens to successful people as they grow older. They lose the ability to risk it all. The more successful they are, the more they want to protect what they have. You go from being a creator to a protector/hoarder. One doesn&#8217;t have to look too far &#8212; those &#8230;

If the URL of an image has search args, I wasn't getting the type correct and Bluesky rejected it. I used a post about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz's</a> statue unveiled in San Francisco <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2025/02/08/aaron-swartz-marble-statue-unveiled-internet-archive/">yesterday</a> to test the fix. I knew Aaron of course, he was part of the group developing <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> in the early 00s. He went on to do other things, as did I, and I met up with him again in NYC in the early teens, and then a few months or a year or two (I don't have the exact date of the meetup) he commited <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/technology/aaron-swartz-internet-activist-dies-at-26.html">suicide</a>. It was a real shock. Now, many years later -- a statue. And the <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/aa1a8beacf79d90bc26105ba46c32072">random snarky slogan</a> my test script picked out was really <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/02/09/aaronScreenshot.png">appropriate</a> to the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bighugga.bsky.social/post/3lhqslgshmt2c">event</a>. It was a tragedy, because an older more confident Aaron would have made a big contribution. I often think about that.

## 2025-02-06 Discord for role-playing games

date: 2025-02-08, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-02-06-discord-for-role-playing-games">2025-02-06 Discord for role-playing games</h1>

<p>Discord really works well for my gaming. I even pay them. 😬 And as far as finding new players goes: essentially there are some generic servers, some servers for particular games or publishers, and for your tables. So you “look for games” in the first two category of servers and then you send interested parties an invite to the server for your table(s).</p>

<p>It’s a bit weird but it works for me.</p>

<p>I don’t use Discord as a chat or forum in the first two kinds of servers. Way too many people and crazy amount of text flying by! But on those small gaming table server? 🥰</p>

<p>I just look the other way when they ask me about my activities shat they can share what music I listen to and what games I play. No way!</p>

<p>One thing that Discord does better than IRC is help handle the dizzying amount of channels per server (i.e. per publisher, rule set or gaming table); their specific rules; their independent admins; their roles; their selective visibility: channels for certain roles only, for certain people only, group chat (ephemeral private channels); their local bots and automations; media uploads; muting for channels and servers, for certain time periods only or until you reverse your decision. All of this is great.</p>

<p>Yes, you can self-host an IRC server and a web frontend like The Lounge (which I do) and you can get close: many channels, but all are equal: there is no formal grouping, no independent moderation, no independent roles, no independent bots. It’s all one big soup. And if you add some rules via nickserv and chanserv, it might get you all the way but is still quite arcane. What a difference Discord makes. Plus effortless voice chat. 🥰</p>

<p>Yes, voice chat and video chat, on top of all that.</p>

<p>Now, you might think: what a shill! But really: I self-host the inferior-but-free options. I write my bot to connect to both (!) IRC and Discord and free content from the black void that is the endless Discord archives. But I also want things to just work. My time is more precious than the €10 (?) I spend every month. And I had to take down Jitsi because it was too resource intensive. The alternative would have been to upgrade my lousy server and spend more time sysadminning and I don’t want to.</p>

<p>So self-hosted IRC has voice and video only if I leech Jitsi from somebody else, as far as I am concerned.</p>

<p>So I don’t know where to go from here. I just pay them for the service. And I look the other way when they disallow other clients. 😓</p>

<p>But then again: I used Bitlbee for a long time. I even wrote a plugin that lets you connect to your fedi instance as if it was an IRC server and another kind soul wrote a plugin that does the same for Discord. And then you start to realize how unusable this is. I’m on maybe two dozen servers? My account has access to 200+ channels, all of the active, all of them need some sort of mapping to IRC channels? It’s hell. Notifications were out of control. I stopped doing it. So: is Discord shit, or the IRC clients? I don’t know. But I know that Discord is not all bad. It’s definitely not bad as an idea of how to organize a gazillion people.</p>

<p>But I do look the other way when I think about tracking and AI training and data brokering.🖕I don’t even know if they do it but these are the days of zero trust and fucking corpo greed maggot CEOs so it doesn’t really matter what they do specifically because I don’t trust any company to do the right thing. Maybe I’d trust them if they were a non-profit association.</p>

<p>Anyway. Just putting this out there because with Discord I’m playing three or four times a week and I only don’t play more because I do want to get out every now and then. 😆</p>

<p><strong>2025-02-08</strong>. <a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org">@Sandra</a> makes a good counter argument:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh, I disagree 100% with the idea that Discord is good. Proprietary infrastructure with network externalities is the unending nightmare we live in. No matter how technically “good” it gets, it’s bad. Actually the “better” it gets, the worse that is because it makes it harder to replace it.</p>

<p>Not that I agree that Discord is technically “good”.</p>

<p>The “per-server organization” is part of the frustration since I can get pinged and spammed and bothered in channels I don’t even want just because I read other channels on that server.</p>

<p>Akkoma’s dev team runs an IRC server of their own and they have a couple of different channels for different things, but thanks to the life-changing magic of IRC actually having its own hackable apps it’s easy on the client end to sort that all out with filters and scriptable rules etc, even merge channels on the user end.</p>

<p>The fact that running mapping apps between Discord and IRC is clunky and difficult and ToS-breaking is another strike against Discord, not for it.</p>

## 2025-02-08 Wie weiter?

date: 2025-02-08, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-02-08-wie-weiter">2025-02-08 Wie weiter?</h1>

<p>Grossdemonstrationen ohne Folgen, selbst die Grünen in Deutschland auf ausländerfeindlichem Kurs, wie weiter? Gute Frage.</p>

<p>Ich glaube, es braucht immer noch Politiker und Pokitikerinnen, die eine Partei im Rücken haben. Es braucht Leute, die das Potential nutzen können und charismatisch genug sind, damit das kleinkarierte Gegeneinander keine Rolle spielt. Revolutionen fangen auch mit vielen Versammlungen und Demos an.</p>

<p>Der Plan ist, dass sich jemand die Demos zunutze macht, weil es ohne Personen, die vorne stehen, nicht geht – so mein Schluss aus dem Occupy Wallstreet, dass sich im Sand verläuft. Da von den bestehenden Parteien niemand hierfür in der Lage zu sein scheint, gibt es nur die Optionen, weiter zu demonstrieren und zu schauen, ob aus der Masse Führungspersönlichkeiten hervorstechen. So tröste ich mich zumindest über den aktuellen Rechtsrutsch und die Taubheit der Politik hinweg.</p>

<p>Klar sind „Führungspersönlichkeiten“ und „Parteien“ keine coolen Begriffe. Was ist mit Anarcho-Syndikalismus? Was ist mit der Abschaffung des Kapitalismus?</p>

<p>Leider ist mir trotz mehr als hundert Folgen Revolutions Podcast hören kein gutes Beispiel eingefallen, wo das gut gelaufen ist. Aber immer waren Organisationen dahinter. Auch Martin Luther King hat organisiert, demonstriert, Reden gehalten.</p>

<p>Deswegen bin ich noch nicht bereit, die parlamentarische Demokratie unter den Bus zu werfen. Das kann auf alle Fälle besser funktionieren. Vermögenssteuer, Kapitalgewinnsteuer, Erbschaftsteuer, Kapitalfluchtverhinderung, Spendenlimiten, Gesetzesreferenden, Verfassungsinitiativen (ich lebe in der Schweiz), bedingungsloses Grundeinkommen, da geht noch einiges. Und Pegida-Märsche haben gezeigt, dass mit Ausdauer schon was zu erreichen ist. Die Rechtspopulisten hier (SVP) haben mit ihrem “Bauernfrühstück” gezeigt, wie Basisarbeit gehen kann. Das einzige, was mir klar ist, ist, dass weiter wie bisher nicht geht. Und wenn wir den Staat destabilisieren, dann drohen Invasion, Warlordism und andere Failed State Varianten. Nichts tolles, auf alle Fälle.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Politics">#Politics</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Germany">#Germany</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Switzerland">#Switzerland</a></p>

<p><strong>2025-02-08</strong>. Witzig: <a href="https://felixbeilharz.de/bundestagswahl-ki/">Wie würde die KI bei der Bundestagswahl 2025 wählen?</a> von Felix Beilharz zeigt, dass sie alle Grüne, SPD und Volt präferieren. Vielleicht kommt ja noch eine Wende!</p>

<p>Auch der Hammer: AfD Wähler glauben <a href="https://www.mimikama.org/wahl-o-mat-manipuliert/">der Wahl-O-Mat ist „linksgrünversifft“ und manipuliert, weil dieser die Grünen oder Linken vorschlägt</a>. 😂</p>

<p>Nachdem <a class="account" href="https://tldr.nettime.org/@tante" title="@tante@tldr.nettime.org">@tante</a> auf fedi gesagt hat, dass er der Linken Partei in Deutschland beigetreten ist, frage ich mich jetzt, ob ich den Grünen in der Schweiz beitreten soll. Die sind sozial-grün, da sich der rechte Flügel der Partei abgespalten hat und jetzt Grün-Liberale Partei heisst. Eine bessere Idee habe ich im Moment auch nicht.</p>

## UK Is Ordering Apple to Break Its Own Encryption

date: 2025-02-08, updated: 2025-02-08, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>The <i>Washington Post</i> is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/">reporting</a> that the UK government has served Apple with a &#8220;technical capability notice&#8221; as defined by the 2016 Investigatory Powers Act, requiring it to break the Advanced Data Protection encryption in iCloud for the benefit of law enforcement.</p>
<p>This is a big deal, and something we in the security community have worried was coming for a while now.</p>
<blockquote><p>The law, known by critics as the Snoopers’ Charter, makes it a criminal offense to reveal that the government has even made such a demand. An Apple spokesman declined to comment...</p></blockquote>

But the other day it updated, and gave me a pause, if they let Musk hack their computers the way he's hacking ours, should I trust what it installs on the vehicle I drive every day that theoretically has the ability to take control of my car and drive it off the road? I wonder if the people at Tesla would like to reassure people who drive their cars that the updates are safe from hacking by one of his associates? How is security on the Tesla network?

When we get back control of the government, ie they're following the Constitution, the Democratic leader in the Senate should be as ruthless as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3lho6p43af22h">this bastard</a>. Chuck Schumer is a nice guy and that sucks.

I have to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3lho6yezbss2e">say</a>, a judge ruling that Musk has to stop, and delete all the info he has stolen, has made me feel much better. I don't know why, but I'm actually laughing out loud. The tight knot in my stomach has relaxed.

## Goodnight Stories for Rebel Girls

date: 2025-02-08, from: Jessica Smith's blog

<p>One of Indie&rsquo;s Christmas presents was the following:</p>

  alt="Photograph of a baby board book entitled ‘Goodnight Stories for Rebel Girls: Baby’s First Book of Extraordinary Women’. The font of the main part of the title is whimsically cursive, while the subtitle is in all caps in a thick, more comic book-style font. The cover illustrations are space-themed, with a dark starry sky for a background, and clip art-style images of a rocket, a moon and a planet. In the top-left quadrant there’s also a baby mobile with a megaphone, a star, a hand making a ‘rock out’ gesture, a lightning bolt, and a love heart dangling from it. The colour theme is blue (dark and light), red (with some pink), yellow and white."
  loading="lazy" class="u-photo u-featured"></a>
<p>When I was teaching, I&rsquo;d sometimes see older girls reading the non-baby book version of this, so I was like, &ldquo;Oh yeah. Rebellion is the kind of spirit I want to inculcate early.&rdquo; I knew it wasn&rsquo;t exactly going to be Marxist propaganda, but <em>man</em> have I been disappointed. I mean, if by &ldquo;rebel&rdquo; you mean &ldquo;woman who played the game and became a resounding success by the parameters of the system she lived in&rdquo; then sure, it&rsquo;s full of rebel women. There are loads of QUEENS, for example. I&rsquo;m sorry, but if you&rsquo;re the QUEEN, you are RUNNING the system, you are not REBELLING AGAINST IT. If you&rsquo;re going to insist on the existence of &ldquo;rebel queens&rdquo;, at least include Queen Lili‘uokalani of Hawaii, who tried (and failed) to resist the forcible takeover of her country by the United States. I guess you could argue that Cleopatra did the same thing against the Romans (and she <em>is</em> in the book), but her page doesn&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;Powerful and wise, Cleopatra seduced two Roman leaders to try to convince them to lay off Egypt.&rdquo; It says, &ldquo;Powerful and wise, she ruled ancient Egypt.&rdquo; How is she a rebel for RULING Egypt? Come on, people.</p>
<p>Beyond actual monarchs, there are also a number of women who are there just for becoming prominent in their fields, be that science, environmentalism, sports, the arts&hellip; I&rsquo;ve got nothing against Marie Curie or Jane Austen, but again, this feels like a very liberal view of &ldquo;rebellion&rdquo; that doesn&rsquo;t meaningfully challenge the system at all. Frida Kahlo is there, but only for her paintings – at no point does it mention she was a revolutionary socialist who helped to shelter Trotsky from Stalin&rsquo;s goons (and had an affair with him, of course, but this is a children&rsquo;s book). The book does have <em>some</em> genuine activists who totally deserve to be there, like Rosa Parks, Malala Yousafzai and Manal al-Sharif, and I&rsquo;m not familiar with every single person in the book so maybe some are just suffering from misleading descriptions, like Frida Kahlo does. Like, maybe the woman who&rsquo;s in there for &ldquo;planting trees&rdquo; actually engaged in direct action to prevent wide-scale deforestation, or something. Probably not, but I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe. (Update: I am pleased to report that the woman who&rsquo;s in there for &ldquo;planting trees&rdquo;, Wangari Maathai, actually was a persistent thorn in the side of the Kenyan government, to the point that at one stage they planned to assassinate her. So let&rsquo;s add her to the column of &ldquo;rebels who totally deserve to be in the book, but got bad descriptions&rdquo;.)</p>
<p>But there are definitely some in there who make me roll my eyes, like Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Viv didn&rsquo;t believe me that they&rsquo;d actually claim a Supreme Court judge was a &ldquo;rebel&rdquo;, so I had to show him, and mockingly read the description: &ldquo;She asked tough questions, like &lsquo;why&rsquo; and &lsquo;how&rsquo;…&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What right-wingers made this book?!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, right,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Leila Khaled?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(For what it&rsquo;s worth, I&rsquo;ve been telling people <abbr title="In Real Life">IRL</abbr> my feelings on this book including relaying this conversation, and not one of them has got the Leila Khaled reference. And I&rsquo;ve just been like… you know… this person?!<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

Text on the mural says ‘LEÏLA KHALED – DON’T FORGET THE STRUGGLE’, and there is also some Arabic text I cannot type up."
  loading="lazy" class="u-photo"></a>
<p>Am I crazy? Is she not as famous as I think she is? And I mean, no, I don&rsquo;t actually want my daughter to grow up to hijack planes, but if we&rsquo;re talking about &ldquo;rebel girls&rdquo;, Leila Khaled is certainly closer to the mark than a fucking Supreme Court judge…)</p>
<p>I just feel like there&rsquo;ve been so many women in history who are so much more deserving of being a &ldquo;goodnight story for rebel girls&rdquo;. I regularly see social media posts about heroic women who joined the Resistance and took out Nazis during <abbr title="World War Two">WW2</abbr>, for example. If we want to continue the theme of radical women in famous photos, there&rsquo;s <a href="https://albavolunteer.org/2020/05/the-girl-who-dated-trotskys-assassin-the-story-behind-an-iconic-photograph/" title="From Toulouse to Trotsky’s Assassin: The Story Behind an Iconic Photograph">this one from the Spanish Civil War<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&thinsp;<svg style="height: 0.7em; width: 0.7em;" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="external-link-alt" class="svg-inline--fa fa-external-link-alt fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><title>(external link)</title><path fill="currentColor" d="M432,320H400a16,16,0,0,0-16,16V448H64V128H208a16,16,0,0,0,16-16V80a16,16,0,0,0-16-16H48A48,48,0,0,0,0,112V464a48,48,0,0,0,48,48H400a48,48,0,0,0,48-48V336A16,16,0,0,0,432,320ZM488,0h-128c-21.37,0-32.05,25.91-17,41l35.73,35.73L135,320.37a24,24,0,0,0,0,34L157.67,377a24,24,0,0,0,34,0L435.28,133.32,471,169c15,15,41,4.5,41-17V24A24,24,0,0,0,488,0Z"></path></svg></span></a>, centring a 17-year-old Marina Ginestà i Coloma (and actually, in one of those historical coincidences, that same page says it was an &ldquo;old flame&rdquo; of hers who moved to Moscow and became the assassin who killed Trotsky. Marina herself, though, was glad never to have got sucked into the orbit of Moscow). There are so many prominent female revolutionaries: communists like Rosa Luxemburg, anarchists like Emma Goldman, Black liberationists like Angela Davis and Assata Shakur. If you REALLY want to include women who became the leaders of countries, you could at least look to Latin American presidents like Michelle Bachelet or Dilma Rousseff who survived torture at the hands of despotic right-wing regimes. My partner would insist that Winnie Mandela deserves a place, even though that&rsquo;s another controversial choice. I feel bad that I don&rsquo;t really know enough about Asian and African history to throw out more suggestions but I&rsquo;m sure there are innumerable candidates. There may even be some good candidates from before the twentieth century, but I think you can see what the bulk of my studies concentrated on, haha.</p>
<p>The point is, they could&rsquo;ve done so much better. Some may say I&rsquo;m expecting a bit much politically from a book whose target audience is literally babies. Some may further say that a book of revolutionary propaganda for babies is unlikely to find a publisher. All of this is true. However, I am entitled to my high standards. If they just hadn&rsquo;t gone for the &ldquo;rebel girls&rdquo; terminology, and instead been like &ldquo;&hellip;for high-achieving girls&rdquo; or &ldquo;&hellip;for girls with big dreams&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;d have annoyed me so much. But to be an inspiration to &ldquo;rebel girls&rdquo; you&rsquo;ve got to actually, you know, <em>rebel</em>. Only a minority of women in the book ever did that.</p>

Maya Miller of the New York Times reported today that the congressional phone system has been jammed with tens of millions of calls from outraged constituents contacting their representatives to demand that they stand against President Donald Trump and his sidekick Elon Musk as they unilaterally dismantle the United States government and gain access to Americans&#8217; private information.

<p>Today I finished writing a blog post that I think is actually good. So I was like, &ldquo;A blog post <em>this</em> good deserves having actual OpenGraph meta tags, which I&rsquo;ve been putting off adding for God knows how many years.&rdquo; Cue me becoming really perfectionistic about the OG image tags, so this is now turning into an hours-long job… 🫣</p>

## Travelling again  It have became a norm that I  have to travel by train. Usually 3-4 hour rides, often with working  WiFi. This in good as I  usually can do some work done.

date: 2025-02-08, from: Jirka's blog

I  have  been using  the  MNT  Pocket Reform  there.  I'm  used to  its orthogonal keyboard  and like its  trackball. It's almost  normal Linux computer, just  an ARM one (and  a bit smaller than  others). So things work as expected here.

<p>Indie has reached another milestone: her first cold 😑</p>
<p>And yeah, it&rsquo;s summer. As far as I can tell it IS just a cold though, because Viv and I (who are also sick) both did 3-in-1 Covid/RSV/flu tests, and were negative to everything. And it doesn&rsquo;t seem severe. It&rsquo;s all brand new to Indie, though…</p>
