challenges and treatment breakthroughs in Malassezia restricta-induced
meningoencephalitis: a real-world analysis of early mNGS
applications</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundMalassezia restricta is a lipid-dependent yeast species
that commonly colonizes human and warm-blooded animal skin as an
opportunistic pathogen. Although strongly associated with dermatological
conditions like seborrheic dermatitis, central nervous system (CNS)
infections caused by Malassezia restricta are remarkably rare. These
infections typically present with nonspecific clinical features, leading
to frequent diagnostic delays and misdiagnosis.MethodsWe performed a
retrospective analysis of five definitive cases of Malassezia
restricta-induced meningoencephalitis diagnosed at our institution.
Comprehensive clinical evaluations included disease onset patterns,
symptomatology, laboratory findings, neuroimaging features, therapeutic
regimens, and patient outcomes.ResultsAll patients exhibited acute onset
meningoencephalitis, with headache being the most common presentation
symptom, and patients presenting with decreased consciousness showed
rapid clinical deterioration. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
exhibits ring enhancement accompanied by ring diffusion restriction,
plays a crucial role in early diagnosis. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
demonstrated markedly elevated intracranial pressure and a significant
decrease in CSF glucose, vital laboratory markers of critical illness.
Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of CSF confirmed
Malassezia restricta infection in all cases, enabling prompt diagnosis.
Early combination therapy with intravenous and intrathecal antifungal
agents significantly improved survival outcomes.ConclusionMalassezia
restricta-associated meningoencephalitis represents an extremely rare
and life-threatening CNS infectious disease. Since nonspecific early
symptoms lead to diagnostic challenges, CSF usually shows a significant
increase in intracranial pressure, and a significant decrease in CSF
glucose levels may serve as a key laboratory biomarker. Brain MRI
demonstrates multiple and diverse intracranial lesions, with ring
enhancement accompanied by ring diffusion restriction potentially
representing relatively specific imaging features. mNGS of CSF may prove
valuable for early diagnosis. Standardized antifungal therapy,
particularly early intrathecal administration, may be critical to
reducing mortality.</p>

id="sars-cov-2-and-streptococcus-pneumoniae-colonization-and-disease-an-observational-study-in-adults">SARS-CoV-2
and Streptococcus pneumoniae colonization and disease: an observational
study in adults</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted global health and
altered respiratory pathogens. While SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have mitigated
COVID-19 severity, emerging variants remain challenging. Co-infection of
Streptococcus pneumoniae with respiratory viruses is associated with
increased disease severity, but its relationship with SARS-CoV-2 remains
unclear. This study aims to analyze their co-occurrence, focusing on
disease progression, colonization rates and clinical outcomes.MethodsTo
this end, three approaches were used. First, a laboratory-based analysis
of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in adults (2019-2023). Second, a
retrospective analysis of COVID-19 clinical cases with pneumococcal
isolates (March,2020–December,2023), including clinical and
microbiological data such as patients’ comorbidities, episode severity,
serotypes and resistance genes. Third, a retrospective analysis to
assess pneumococcal colonization in SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal
samples (May-October 2023; dual-target RT-PCR). WGS and bioinformatics
were performed on both bacterial (serotyping and resistance analysis)
and viral genomes (lineage determination). Statistical comparisons
(Chi-square, Fisher’s test), with significance set at
p&lt;0.05.ResultsFirst, IPD incidence declined during the COVID-19
pandemic, with cases dropping by 70% in both age groups (18–64 and
&gt;64) from 2019 to 2021 and rebounding after 2021, concomitant with
the relaxation of non-pharmaceutical measures, especially among older
adults. Pneumococcal serotype distribution remained stable with
dominance of serotypes 3 and 8. Serotype 12F disappeared during the
lockdown and re-emerged in 2023 as a multidrug-resistant sub-lineage
through multi-fragment recombination, derived from the former GPSC26.
Second, SARS-CoV-2 and pneumococcal co-infection occurred in 66
hospitalized patients, mainly by serotype 3 (15%), with resistance to
macrolides (26.3%) and tetracycline (22.8%). Third, pneumococcal
colonization in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients was low (2.8%), especially
in older adults (&gt;64 years; 1.5%), with slightly higher rates in
severe cases (4.7% vs 2.5%; p=0.404; IC95% 0.13-3.05) and young adults
(4.8% vs 1.5%; p=0.04; IC95% 0.92-15.21). Compared to colonized
patients, those with co-infection had more comorbidities, more severe
clinical presentations, higher hospitalization rates and lower
vaccination rates.DiscussionThis study highlights how non-pharmaceutical
measures disrupt S. pneumoniae dynamics. Although pneumococcal
colonization in SARS-CoV-2 patients appears to be infrequent, our data
suggest an increase in disease severity. Then, vaccination programs and
their monitoring remain critical in the prevention of respiratory
infections.</p>

novel method for precise endoscopic sampling of duodenal microbiota</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundPrevious studies have established a relationship between
duodenal mucosa-associated microbiota and overall health. However,
sampling duodenal microbiota is technically challenging. Mucosal
biopsies collected via endoscopy are the most common approach, but this
method risks contamination of the working channel with gastrointestinal
contents or extraneous microorganisms.MethodsThis study designed a novel
accessory, an endoscopic channel plug, to improve the sampling process
by ensuring a clean and sterile working channel, thereby providing more
accurate microbiota results.Results and conclusionMicrobiome analysis of
samples collected from the oral cavity, traditional duodenal sampling,
and the modified method with the channel plug revealed that samples
obtained with the plug exhibited higher PCR product concentrations and a
greater number of operational taxonomic units (335). Additionally, 16S
rRNA sequencing showed significant differences in the taxonomic
composition at both the phylum and genus levels among the different
sampling methods. Notably, the novel method group (using the channel
plug) contained a higher abundance of Veillonella, whereas this genus
was less abundant in oral cavity and traditional duodenal samples.
Furthermore, the abundance of specific bacterial strains varied
significantly between sampling methods. These findings suggest that the
use of the channel plug enables more comprehensive microbiota sampling,
providing data to support clinical diagnosis of gastrointestinal
diseases.</p>

salts carrying two positive charges: design, synthesis,
characterization, molecular docking, antibacterial and enzyme inhibitory
activities</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe discovery of alternative drugs has gained importance
due to the many side effects of these drugs used for
treatment.MethodsHerein, the synthesis of a series of unsymmetrical
imidazolium salts containing 4-acetylphenyl/4-formylphenyl and bioactive
heterocyclic groups such as morpholine, piperidine, pyrrole or pyridine
was reported. 4-(1-H-imidazol-1-yl)acetophenone and
4-(1-H-imidazol-1-yl)benzaldehyde were used as salt precursors. Alkyl
halides containing heterocyclic groups such as 2-morpholinoethyl
hydrochloride, 2-pyrrolidinoethyl hydrochloride, 2-piperidinoethyl
hydrochloride and pyridin-2-ylmethyl bromide hydrobromide were used.
Thus, there are two positively charged nitrogens in the structure of
these salts synthesized by the quaternization method. The structures of
all salts were fully characterized by 1H, 13C NMR, FTIR spectroscopic
and elemental analysis methods. the a series of imidazolium salts (1a-d
and 2a-d) were designed, synthesized and fully characterized by
spectroscopic methods.ResultsThe inhibitory effect against AChE of the
series compounds was evaluated as in vitro and in silico studies. The
results indicated that the compounds showed remarkably potent inhibitory
effects on AChE with KI values ranging from 0.63 ± 0.04 μM to 11.23 ±
1.05 μM and IC50 values spanning from 0.82 ± 0.06 μM to 14.75 ± 0.82 μM.
The antimicrobial activities of the synthesized compounds were measured
by inhibition of bacterial growth expressed as minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) values. It was observed that the synthesized
compounds exhibited antimicrobial activity especially against Gram
negative bacteria. In addition, the results of molecular docking studies
of bacteria supported our antimicrobial results.ConclusionsThe results
suggested that the synthesized compounds showed the potential to be
antimicrobial and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.</p>

the role of SEMA4A/MAPK signaling in sepsis: insights from Mendelian
randomization, transcriptomic, single-cell sequencing analyses, and
vitro experiments</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundSepsis is a condition with high mortality and multiple
organ dysfunction, undergoing complex pathogenesis and limited treatment
options. This study aims to uncover new therapeutic targets for
sepsisMethodsThree independent transcriptomic datasets from sepsis
patients in the GEO database were utilized. Batch effect correction and
differential gene expression analysis were performed to identify
differentially expressed genes (DEGs), followed by mendelian
randomization (MR) analysis to identify sepsis-related risk genes. The
intersection of DEGs and MR risk genes revealed final core sepsis genes.
Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
enrichment analyses were conducted to elucidate the functional pathways
of core genes. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis was
employed to evaluate gene expression profiles across various cell types
in sepsis. In vitro experiments were performed to validate pathways
associated with the core genes.ResultsWe identified 307 highly expressed
DEGs and 72 disease-related risk genes, culminating in the
identification of three core sepsis genes including SEMA4A, LRPAP1, and
NTSR1. These genes are involved in biological processes and pathways
related to immune responses, such as immune rejection. scRNA-seq data
indicated that three core sepsis genes are predominantly expressed in
monocytes. In vitro experiments using THP-1 human monocytic cells
validated that SEMA4A as well as the MAPK biomarker gene ERK were
up-regulated in LPS-induced sepsis cells.ConclusionThis study proposes
SEMA4A, LRPAP1, and NTSR1 as promising therapeutic targets for sepsis.
Particularly, it underscores the crucial role of SEMA4A/MAPK in
monocytes in the pathogenesis and progression of sepsis, offering
valuable insights for potential treatment strategies.</p>

the health benefits of Ganoderma: antimicrobial properties and
mechanisms of action</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-18, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Ganoderma, a well-known medicinal mushroom, has garnered attention
for its broad therapeutic properties, particularly its potent
antimicrobial activities. This review focuses on the mechanisms of
action and bioactive compounds responsible for the ability of Ganoderma
to inhibit various pathogenic microorganisms. The polysaccharides,
triterpenoids, proteins, and phenolic compounds in Ganoderma exhibit
strong antimicrobial effects by targeting bacterial cell walls,
disrupting membrane integrity, and inhibiting key microbial enzymes.
These compounds are effective against a wide range of bacteria,
including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, and various fungi. Triterpenoids, specifically, have
demonstrated efficacy in modulating immune responses, further enhancing
the body’s defense mechanisms against infections. Furthermore, the role
of Ganoderma in preventing biofilm formation and combating
antibiotic-resistant strains highlights its potential as a natural
antimicrobial agent. While in vitro and in vivo studies strongly support
the antimicrobial properties of Ganoderma, future resety -50arch should
focus on large-scale clinical trials to confirm its efficacy and explore
its synergistic effects with conventional antibiotics. Establishing
standardized dosages and exploring the molecular pathways of its
antimicrobial actions will be key to incorporating Ganoderma into
clinical practice for infection control.</p>

hepatitis B virus reactivation and its impact on survival in HBV-related
hepatocellular carcinoma patients undergoing conversion therapy with

<p>date: 2025-07-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate hepatitis B virus (HBV)
reactivation and its impact on postoperative survival in patients with
HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent conversion
therapy. The therapeutic regimen consisted of interventional procedures
(hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy [HAIC] and/or transarterial
chemoembolization [TACE]) combined with tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).MethodsA retrospective
analysis was performed at a single institution involving 91 patients who
had initially unresectable HCC linked to the hepatitis B virus. These
patients achieved resectability following conversion therapy and
subsequently underwent surgical tumor removal. Logistic regression
identified risk factors for HBV reactivation (HBVr). Kaplan-Meier
survival analysis and log-rank tests assessed survival differences. Cox
proportional hazards regression was used to identify independent
predictors of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival
(OS).ResultsIn our cohort, HBVr occurred in 17 patients (18.7%), all of
whom received antiviral therapy. The incidence of HBVr was 16.7% (14/84)
in patients with detectable baseline HBV DNA and 42.9% (3/7) in those
with undetectable levels. Baseline HBV DNA ≥2000 IU/ml was identified as
an independent protective factor against HBVr (OR 0.090, 95% CI
0.015–0.532; P = 0.008). The median PFS was significantly shorter in the
reactivation group than in the non-reactivation group (12.1 months [95%
CI 5.5–18.7] vs. 29.2 months [95% CI 23.6–34.7]; P &lt; 0.001). However,
no significant difference was observed in median OS between the two
groups (not reached vs. 45.6 months [95% CI 41.7–49.5]; P =
0.117).ConclusionHBVr represents a potential complication in subjects
receiving hepatectomy for hepatitis B virus associated HCC following
conversion therapy involving interventional therapies combined with TKIs
and ICIs. Patients experiencing HBVr exhibited significantly shorter
progression-free survival compared to those without reactivation.
Therefore, prophylactic antiviral therapy and meticulous HBV DNA
monitoring are warranted during both conversion therapy and the
perioperative period.</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveTo investigate the mechanism of biofilm-mediated resistance
to berberine in Escherichia coli.MethodsThe resistance of berberine
against E. coli was induced by 1/2 MIC (minimum inhibitory
concentration). Biofilm formation was detected by crystal violet
staining. The mRNA level was detected by RT-qPCR, and the gene csgD was
determined. the csgD-overexpressed strain was constructed. We measured
the MIC of berberine against E. coli, as well as biofilm formation and
the expression of mRNA.ResultsThe MIC after berberine induction was more
than 32 times than the MIC before induction. the biofilm was
significantly increased at 24, 48 and 72 hours (p&lt;0.01) after
berberine induction. In addition, the amount of biofilm production at
24, 48 and 72 hours was 1.3, 1.51 and 1.98 times after berberine
induction than that before induction, respectively. The expression of
csgD gene was significantly increased (p=0.016) after induction compared
with that before induction. the MIC of csgD-overexpressed strain was
about 5.8 times that before induction. The expression of csgD gene was
significantly increased (p=0.016), which was 5.8 times higher than that
before induction. The MIC of csgD-overexpressed strain was 100 μg/mL.
Biofilm formation in csgD-overexpressed strain was 2.9 times higher than
that of the control. The expression of biofilm-related genes, bcsA, luxS
and csgD, was 45, 22.5 and 1628 times higher than that of the control,
respectively.ConclusionBerberine might increase biofilm formation by
inducing the expression of csgD gene, which might result in drug
resistance in E. coli.</p>

iron supplementation enhances intestinal barrier function in weaned
piglets challenged with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundSince iron is an essential mineral for both host and
microbial communities, how to scientifically replenish the iron in the
context of bacterial infection has become a critical issue. The aim of
this study was to compare the influence of intramuscular and oral iron
supplementation on the progression of bacterial infection. MethodsWeaned
piglets served as an experimental model for iron supplementation
following enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) K88 infection. Piglets
in control and oral iron supplementation groups received FeSO4 orally,
while those in the intramuscular iron supplementation group were
administered iron dextran (FeDex) via intramuscular injection. After
challenge, piglets were euthanized, and serum and small intestinal
tissues were collected for biochemical analysis, histological
examination, inflammatory response assessment, gut microbiota profiling,
and iron metabolism evaluation.ResultsIntramuscular iron supplementation
alleviated the clinical symptoms of bacterial infection, decreasing the
diarrhea rate by 53% and mitigating the inflammatory response with lower
serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-6, and
IL-8. Compared to oral iron supplementation, intramuscular iron
supplementation significantly mitigated the intestinal damage caused by
ETEC K88 infection by increasing the ratio of villus length to crypt
depth, and repairing epithelial tight junction. Furthermore,
intramuscular iron supplementation also protected the function of
intestinal goblet cells and improved iron metabolism of infected
piglets.ConclusionIntramuscular iron supplementation is more effective
during infection than oral iron supplementation.</p>

infection drives proinflammatory adipocyte differentiation in an in
vitro model and reveals a new inflammatory pathway</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-17, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionAdipose tissue regulates metabolic homeostasis and serves
as a reservoir for mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which differentiate
into osteoblasts and adipocytes, balancing bone and lipid metabolism.
Bone loss and fat accumulation are common in individuals living with
HIV, prompting us to investigate how R5- and X4-tropic HIV modulates
adipocyte differentiation and tissue homeostasis using an in vitro model
of MSC-derived adipogenesis.MethodsThe study used an in vitro model of
MSCs to examine how R5- and X4-tropic HIV strains affect adipocyte
differentiation and function. Researchers assessed adipogenesis by
analyzing lipid droplet formation, expression of adipogenic
transcription factors (C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, PPAR-γ), lipogenic/lipolytic
enzymes, SREBPs, cytokine secretion, and the effects of CXCR4 and CCR5
with specific inhibitors.ResultsHIV exposure influences adipogenesis,
increasing lipid droplet size in a tropism dependent manner and
upregulating key adipogenic factors such as C/EBPα, C/ EBPβ, and PPAR-γ.
This process involves the regulation of lipogenic and lipolytic enzymes,
lipid droplet-lysosome interactions, and potential lipid droplet
mitochondria cross-talk to fuel lipid accumulation. Additionally, HIV
modulates sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), which
control fatty acid, triacylglycerol, and cholesterol synthesis. Notably,
SREBP2 downregulation correlates with increased type I interferons
(IFNa2, IFNb1), linking lipid metabolism to immune responses in HIV
infection. HIV-infected adipocytes also exhibit an increased
leptin/adiponectin ratio and enhanced IL-1b and IL-6 secretion,
contributing to the inflammatory state observed in people with HIV.
CXCR4 plays a key role in adipocyte differentiation, as its inhibition
with AMD3100 reduces adipocyte number, size, and lipid droplet
accumulation under X4-tropic HIV exposure. In contrast, CCR5 does not
appear to be significantly involved in adipose tissue homeostasis under
R5-tropic HIV exposure.DiscussionThese findings, derived from an in
vitro model, suggest that HIV alters MSC differentiation into
adipocytes, impacting adipose tissue homeostasis and function.</p>

<p>IntroductionCervical cancer is the fourth most common malignancy in
women and is primarily caused by persistent infection with high-risk
human papillomavirus (HPV). In addition, host immune responses, genetic
factors, and lifestyle habits also have etiological roles. The
cervicovaginal microbiome undergoes dynamic changes during menopause,
which may be involved in the progression of cervical neoplasia. We aimed
to elucidate the association between cervical microenvironmental changes
and the progression of cervical neoplasia before and after menopause by
integrating analyses of the cervical microbiome, related metabolites,
cytokines, and microRNAs.MethodsA total of 248 HPV-positive women with
cervical neoplasia, including 17 with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia
(CIN1), 80 with CIN2, 82 with CIN3, and 69 with squamous cell carcinoma
(SCC), were enrolled. As normal controls, 48 HPV-negative healthy women
were included. Each group was stratified based on the mean menopausal
age of 50 years. Cervical mucus was analyzed according to the methods
outlined below. The microbiota was profiled by 16S rRNA gene sequencing,
metabolites were analyzed by ultra-HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry,
RT-qPCR was used for miRNA expression analysis, and RANTES levels were
quantified by multiplex bead array. Data analysis was performed using
MicrobiomeAnalyst and MetaboAnalyst.ResultsIn the SCC group, Prevotella
and Atopobium were the key bacterial genera among the younger group,
while Peptoniphilus, Fusobacterium, and Porphyromonas were more
prevalent in elderly group (LDA score &gt; 4.5). We observed a
consistent positive correlation between Atopobium and xanthine in
younger groups with CIN2 or worse (p &lt; 0.0001). However, no such
correlations were detected in elderly women. In addition, Atopobium,
Adlercreutzia, and Gardnerella showed significant positive correlation
with nicotinic acid in younger women with SCC compared to the elderly
women (p &lt; 0.0001). In the younger SCC women, several metabolites
were significantly elevated in groups with high expression levels of
RANTES, miR-20b-5p, and miR-155-5p.ConclusionThe cervical microbiome
undergoes changes during menopause, and may influence disease
progression by interacting with metabolites, cytokines, and miRNAs.
These results highlight the potential for personalized medicine for
cervical cancer that is tailored to different age groups.</p>

microbiota and osteoarthritis: epidemiology, mechanistic analysis, and
new horizons for pharmacological interventions</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota dysbiosis is
associated with the onset and progression of osteoarthritis (OA). While
OA was traditionally considered a localized degenerative joint
condition, it is now increasingly viewed as a systemic disorder
involving low-grade inflammation and metabolic imbalance. This review
synthesizes current findings on the gut–joint axis and presents a
structured overview of how alterations in microbial communities may
relate to phenotypic variability in OA. Observational studies have
identified correlations between gut dysbiosis and factors such as
obesity and hyperuricemia, which are themselves linked to increased
intestinal permeability, elevated circulating lipopolysaccharide levels,
and reduced production of short-chain fatty acids. These features may
contribute to immune dysregulation and tissue degeneration, although
definitive causal mechanisms remain unconfirmed. Some reports have also
detected microbial DNA in joint tissues, raising the possibility of
microbial translocation and its potential role in local inflammatory
processes. In light of these associations, we review several
microbiota-directed interventions, including probiotics, dietary
supplements, Traditional Chinese Medicine, and biomaterial-based
approaches. Although preliminary studies suggest these strategies may
influence systemic inflammation and joint health, most evidence is
derived from preclinical models or small-scale clinical trials.
Causality has not yet been firmly established, and further validation in
larger, well-controlled studies is needed. By integrating current
mechanistic insights with emerging therapeutic directions, this review
highlights the potential relevance of the gut–joint connection in OA and
underscores the importance of continued research toward
microbiota-informed, individualized approaches to disease understanding
and management.</p>

features of patients with fungal infections caused by CARD9 deficiency:
a literature review of case reports</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Caspase recruitment domain containing protein 9 (CARD9) deficiency is
an autosomal-recessive primary immunodeficiency disorder, undermines the
body’s capacity to combat fungal infections. In recent years, the number
of reported cases of fungal infections associated with CARD9 deficiency
has been increasing. This study undertook a systematic review of case
reports, incorporating 89 patients with CARD9 deficiency complicated by
fungal infections. The findings demonstrated that the patient population
predominantly consisted of young and middle-aged individuals (33.43 ±
19.12 years, range: 1-91), and the majority (52 patients, 58.43%)
developed the disease during childhood or adolescence. Significant
geographical variations were observed in the distribution of gene
mutations. Specifically, the c.820dupG mutation was predominantly found
in East Asia, while the c.865C&gt;T mutation was primarily found North
Africa. Regarding the clinical manifestations, the most frequently
affected sites were the skin, central nervous system, and lymph nodes,
and the principal fungal pathogens identified were Trichophyton and
Candida. Correlation analysis indicated that c.883C&gt;T increased the
likelihood of Candida infection (p=0.008, OR=10.421, 95% CI
1.849-58.748), c.865C&gt;T increased the probability of Trichophyton
infection (p=0.038, OR=5.760, 95% CI 1.098-30.217) and dematiaceous
fungi infection (p=0.005, OR=9.653, 95% CI 2.019-46.153). According to
the types of mutations, nonsense mutation increased the risk of
dematiaceous fungi infection (p=0.014, OR=6.212, 95% CI 1.453-26.556).
Notably, a proportion of patients succumbed to the disease, and this was
predominantly associated with infections of the central nervous system,
blood system, and viscera. This underscores the importance of adequate
antifungal therapy and long-term follow-up for patients with CARD9
deficiency-related fungal infections.</p>

impact of rifampin on the efficacy of implant retention and prosthesis
removal in staphylococcal periprosthetic joint infection</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-16, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectivesThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of
adjunctive rifampicin therapy on the outcomes of prosthesis retention
versus removal in patients with staphylococcal prosthetic joint
infection (PJI) undergoing antibacterial treatment.MethodsA
retrospective study was conducted on 227 patients diagnosed with
Staphylococcal PJI from March 2014 to September 2023 who underwent
debridement, antibiotics, and implant retention (DAIR) or explantation
and revision surgery. Based on antimicrobial susceptibility testing, we
used an effective baseline antibiotic regimen. We defined the
combination of this regimen with rifampicin as the “rifampicin treatment
group” and the regimen without rifampicin as the “non-rifampicin
treatment group”.ResultsA total of 79 patients were included in the
rifampin treatment group and 148 in the non-rifampin treatment group.
There was no significant difference in the remission rate of PJI between
the rifampin treatment group and the non-rifampin treatment group
(79.75% vs 73.65%, p = 0.083). Additionally, Kaplan-Meier survival curve
analysis showed no statistically significant difference between the two
groups (p = 0.509). However, the incidence of drug-related adverse
events was significantly higher in the rifampin treatment group compared
to the non-rifampin treatment group (31.65% vs 8.78%, p &lt; 0.001).
There were no significant difference in treatment success rates between
the use and non-use of rifampin in DAIR, one-stage revision, or
two-stage revision, as well as in hip or knee joints. Binary logistic
regression analysis identified diabetes and active smoking as
independent significant risk factors for treatment failure, while
rifampin was not an independent risk factor affecting the
outcome.ConclusionThe study has not demonstrated that the standard
antibiotic regimen combined with rifampin has a significant effect on
the efficacy of retaining or removing prostheses in staphylococcal PJI,
but rather increases drug-related adverse events. Standard surgical
procedures, accurate pathogen diagnosis, and treatment are particularly
crucial in the management of PJI.</p>

a language model for predicting lysine crotonylation in pathogenic
fungal proteins</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-15, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionLysine crotonylation (Kcr) is an important
post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins, playing a key role in
regulating various biological processes in pathogenic fungi. However,
the experimental identification of Kcr sites remains challenging due to
the high cost and time-consuming nature of mass spectrometry-based
techniques.MethodsTo address this limitation, we developed Fungi-Kcr, a
deep learning-based model designed to predict Kcr modification sites in
fungal proteins. The model integrates convolutional neural networks
(CNN), gated recurrent units (GRU), and word embedding to effectively
capture both local and long-range sequence
dependencies.ResultsComprehensive evaluations, including ten-fold
cross-validation and independent testing, demonstrate that Fungi-Kcr
achieves superior predictive performance compared to conventional
machine learning models. Moreover, our results indicate that a general
predictive model performs better than species-specific models.
DiscussionThe proposed model provides a valuable computational tool for
the large-scale identification of Kcr sites, contributing to a deeper
understanding of fungal pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets.

virus epidemiology and regional control strategies: diagnostics,
vaccines, and vector management</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Schmallenberg virus (SBV) is an emerging orthobunyavirus transmitted
by Culicoides midges. It poses a serious global health threat to
ruminants, especially during pregnancy, causing abortion, stillbirths,
and congenital malformations. Since its first outbreak in 2011, SBV has
spread across Europe and other regions. Its transmission has expanded
due to global climate change and increased animal trade, resulting in
recurrent outbreaks in endemic regions and a growing risk of
introduction into non-endemic areas. This situation highlights the
urgent need for improved control strategies. This review summarizes the
pathogenic and epidemiological characteristics of SBV and provides an
overview of recent advancements in diagnostic approaches, vaccine
development, and vector control. Diagnostic approaches, such as
serological assays and nucleic acid-based tests, have become the primary
tools for SBV detection. However, their applicability in clinical
settings still requires further optimization. In terms of vaccine
development, existing inactivated vaccines have limitations, including
the inability to distinguish between vaccinated and infected animals.
This has driven the development of next-generation vaccines, such as
recombinant protein, viral vector, and mRNA-based platforms. For vector
control, integrated approaches combining chemical, ecological, and
biological strategies have been proposed to interrupt the transmission
of the virus by Culicoides midges. Additionally, this review emphasizes
the necessity of region-specific control strategies tailored to the
differing epidemiological contexts. In endemic regions, comprehensive
measures, including pathogen surveillance, vaccination programs, and
Culicoides control, are critical. In non-endemic regions, the focus
should be on enhancing border biosecurity, monitoring international
trade, and establishing early warning systems. These strategies not only
provide a scientific foundation for SBV control but also offer practical
guidance for managing the spread of similar vector-borne viruses
globally.</p>

clinical, and molecular analysis of human adenovirus infections in
hospitalized children with acute respiratory infections in Tianjin,
China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundHuman Adenovirus (HAdV) is a significant pathogen for acute
respiratory infections(ARIs) in children. However, its epidemiological
patterns, serotype distribution changes, and molecular mechanisms
associated with severe pneumonia during and after the COVID-19 pandemic
require further elucidation through large-scale and molecular typing
studies.MethodsThis study used a retrospective cohort design to analyze
28060 respiratory specimens from Tianjin Children’s Hospital from March
2022 to March 2024. HAdV detection and typing were performed through
targeted high-throughput sequencing and PCR-based amplification of
Penton, Hexon, and Fiber genes for phylogenetic analysis. Additionally,
clinical data were compared to assess differences in clinical
presentations among pediatric patients infected with different HAdV
types.ResultsThe overall HAdV detection rate was 8.9% (2,484/28,060),
with significant male predominance (9.2% vs. 8.4%, P = 0.019) and
age-specific susceptibility peaking in school-aged children (10.4%, P
&lt; 0.001). Seasonal patterns demonstrated winter predominance (15.9%),
contrasting with other seasons (P &lt; 0.001). Genotyping of 1,914
positive specimens demonstrated HAdV-3 dominance (53.4%, 1,022),
followed by HAdV-7 (17.7%, 338), HAdV-2 (8.4%, 160), HAdV-1 (7.9%, 152),
and HAdV-21 (6.4%, 122). The diagnosis mainly included pneumonia,
bronchitis, adenopharyngitis, and upper respiratory tract infections
(URTIs). Genotype-clinical correlations showed distinct patterns: HAdV-3
(55.6%) and HAdV-7 (20.9%) predominated in pneumonia cases, with HAdV-7
linked to severe pneumonia (P&lt;0.001). HAdV-3 (40.6%) and HAdV-2
(16.7%) were more common in adenopharyngitis, while HAdV-3 and HAdV-21
were more common in bronchitis (51.2% and 11.1%) and URTIs (31.9% and
19.1%). Molecular characterization revealed structural conservation in
the Penton protein of HAdV-C and identified Hexon as the most
polymorphic region with 85 variable sites, indicating divergent
evolutionary pressures across viral domains.ConclusionHAdV-3, HAdV-7,
HAdV-2, and HAdV-1 were the predominant HAdV types in children
hospitalized with ARIs in Tianjin. Moreover, not only the
epidemiological characteristics of different HAdV types vary, but there
are also certain differences in the clinical symptoms and outcomes of
children infected with different types of HAdV. Therefore, it is
essential to differentiate HAdV types for epidemiological surveillance
and clinical management purposes.</p>

characterization of Phialophora submersa, a new black yeast isolated
from freshwater sediments in Spain</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Phialophora submersa is a recently described black yeast species
(Chaetothyriales), isolated from freshwater sediments in Catalonia
(Spain). It is closely related to P. americana and P. verrucosa, two
opportunistic pathogens known to cause subcutaneous infections in humans
and animals. This study investigates the pathogenic potential of P.
submersa, its in vitro susceptibility to clinically relevant antifungal
agents, and its response to various cellular stressors. Using a murine
macrophage (J774A.1) infection model, we evaluated phagocytosis,
intracellular survival, cell damage, and the expression of six
immune-related genes (TNF-α, CCL20, RELA, TP53, NLRP3, IL-1β), in
comparison with P. americana and P. verrucosa. The results showed that
P. submersa induced higher phagocytosis rates in murine macrophages than
the P. verrucosa, although lower than P. americana. Cell damage,
intracellular survival, and expression of the immune-related genes were
higher after macrophage infection with P. verrucosa than with P.
submersa and P. americana, which exhibited comparable profiles. All
three species displayed similar antifungal susceptibility profiles,
being susceptible to most azoles (except fluconazole), terbinafine, and
echinocandins (with reduced efficacy against P. verrucosa), but showed
moderate resistance to flucytosine, amphotericin B, and olorofim. The
resistance of P. submersa to stress was strain-dependent, with only one
strain exhibiting notable resistance to multiple stressors. This
research provides new insights into the biology of P. submersa,
including its potential as a human pathogen, and the molecular factors
that could drive an infection process.</p>

against pathogenic microorganisms</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe increasing resistance to antimicrobial drugs has
prompted global efforts to combat pathogenic bacteria and fungi. The
World Health Organization’s recent report underscores the urgent need
for innovative antimicrobial strategies to address infections caused by
Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and Candida
tropicalis. This study presents a comparative evaluation of the effects
of biogenically synthesized zinc nanoparticles (ZnNPs) from Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, highlighting their effectiveness against both planktonic and
sessile forms of these tested pathogens.MethodsThe antimicrobial effects
were assessed using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method, broth
microdilution, and time-kill assays. Biofilm formation and eradication
were evaluated through crystal violet staining, resazurin assays, and
colony-forming unit quantification. Additionally, the oxidative and
nitrosative stress toxicity mechanisms triggered by ZnNPs, particularly
those related to cellular stress, were investigated.ResultsThe results
demonstrated that ZnNPs exhibit concentration-dependent inhibitory
effects on both prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms. ZnNPs inhibit
biofilm formation by up to 50% in E. coli and yeast species, and up to
80% in S. aureus.DiscussionThese antibiofilm activities were attributed
to disruptions in cellular stress metabolism, primarily driven by
nitrosative stress through enhanced production of reactive nitrogen
intermediates. ZnNPs synthesized through green methods offer significant
advantages due to their biocompatibility and potential biomedical
applications. These findings advance our understanding of ZnNPs in
combating biofilm-associated infections, offering promising strategies
to address pathogenic bacteria and fungi, which pose a critical threat
to global health.</p>
