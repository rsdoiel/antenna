<p>Bernardo took the stand Thursday. He said he found Klein’s email to
be “callous,” and not reflective of the UCLA Anderson School of
Management’s values. He also listed the “tumult” caused by Klein’s
original email, a desire to support students’ interests and damage to
the university’s reputation as motivations for placing Klein on academic
leave.</p>

stamps – a numbering system for identifying court documents – during his

<p>Madsen also said that he estimated total damages to be $13.3 million,
a reduced amount from his initial valuation. He added that the estimate
was “conservative” as it only accounted for inflation and not forecasted
income growth.</p>

<p>Eric Madsen, a managing director at the Berkeley Research Group and a
specialist in economic damages, testified as an expert witness Tuesday.
Madsen said that Klein’s administrative leave and Bernardo’s email
calling Klein’s behavior “outrageous and simply inexcusable” was
attributable to Klein’s substantial drop in consulting income, which
amounted to $1.366 million in 2019.</p>
