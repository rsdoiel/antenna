<p>Bernardo took the stand Thursday. He said he found Klein’s email to
be “callous,” and not reflective of the UCLA Anderson School of
Management’s values. He also listed the “tumult” caused by Klein’s
original email, a desire to support students’ interests and damage to
the university’s reputation as motivations for placing Klein on academic
leave.</p>

Madsen said that Klein’s administrative leave and Bernardo’s email
