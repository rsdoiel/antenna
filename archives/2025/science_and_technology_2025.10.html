the (discontinued) hybrid Debian GNU/kFreeBSD distribution</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>For decades, Linux and BSD have stood as two dominant yet
fundamentally different branches of the Unix-like operating system
world. While Linux distributions, such as Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora,
have grown to dominate the open-source ecosystem, BSD-based systems like
FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD have remained the preferred choice for
those seeking security, performance, and licensing flexibility. But what
if you could combine the best of both worlds—Debian’s vast package
ecosystem with FreeBSD’s robust and efficient kernel? Enter Debian
GNU/kFreeBSD, a unique experiment that merges Debian’s familiar userland
with the FreeBSD kernel, offering a hybrid system that takes advantage
of FreeBSD’s technical prowess while maintaining the ease of use
associated with Debian. This article dives into the world of Debian
GNU/kFreeBSD, exploring its architecture, installation, benefits,
challenges, and real-world applications. ↫ George Whittaker More of a
list of upsides and downsides than an actual in-depth article, but that
doesn’t make it any less interesting. There’s a variety of attempts out
there to somehow marry the Linux and BSD worlds, and each of them takes
a unique approach. I’m not sure the Debian userland with a FreeBSD
kernel is the way to go, though, and it seems I’m not alone – Debian
GNU/kFreeBSD was officially dropped from Debian in 2015 or so, and after
a flurry of unofficial activity in 2019, it was discontinued completely
in 2023 due to a lack of activity and developer interest. Odd that the
source article doesn’t mention that. If you’re still interested in a
combination of Linux and BSD, I’d keep an eye on Chimera Linux instead.
It’s very actively developed, focuses on portable code by supporting
many architectures, and its developers are veterans in this space. I
have my eye on Chimera Linux as my future distribution of choice.</p>

suddenly bricking features, like scanning or printing, if users install
third-party cartridges. Some printer firms outright block third-party
toner and ink, despite customer blowback and lawsuits. Brother’s laser
printers have historically worked fine with non-Brother accessories. A
YouTube video posted this week, though, as well as older social media
posts, claim that Brother has gone to the dark side and degraded laser
printer functionality with third-party cartridges. Brother tells Ars
that this isn’t true. ↫ Scharon Harding at Ars Technica I find this an
incredibly interesting story. We all know the printer space is a cursed
hellhole of the very worst worst types of enshittification, but Brother
seemed like an island of relative calm in a sea of bullshit. In turn,
people are so used to printers being shit, that any problem that comes
up is automatically explained by malice, which is not entirely
unreasonable. Borther insists, though, that it does not break printers
using third-party toner or ink through firmware. Brother does make it
very clear that it is standard procedure to only perform troubleshooting
on Brother printers using ‘genuine’ Brother ink and toner, which is not
entirely unreasonable in my book. There’s no telling what kind of
effects third part cartridges – which do contain electronics – have on
the rest of the printer, and I don’t think it’s fair to expect Brother
to be able to document all of those possible issues. As long as using
third-party toner and ink cartridges doesn’t invalidate any warranties,
and as long as Brother doesn’t intentionally break printers for using
third-party toner and ink, I think Brother meets its obligations to
consumers. If you choose to use third-party ink and toner cartridges in
Brother printers, I think it’s only reasonable you remove those during
the troubleshooting process to ensure they’re not the cause of any
problems you’re experiencing.</p>

the curl command-line tool and library with Goa</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>For more than a decade, we have a port of the curl library for Genode
available. With the use of Sculpt OS as a daily driver as well as the
plan to run Goa natively on Sculpt OS by the end of the year, the itch
to also port the curl command-line tool became irresistible. Of course
this is a perfect territory for using Goa. In this article, I will share
the process of porting the curl command-line tool and shared library in
order to guide future porting efforts of other projects. ↫ Johannes
Schlatow A detailed, step-by-step retelling of porting the curl
command-line tool and associated libraries to Genode/Sculpt OS. Articles
like these are invaluable to anyone trying to port things to Genode and
Sculpt OS, as it points to some directions you can explore when
encountering errors and hurdles of your own.</p>
