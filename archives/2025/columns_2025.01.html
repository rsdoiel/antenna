<h2 id="asking-for-change-politely">2025-01-06 Asking for change,
politely</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-01-06-asking-for-change-politely">
2025-01-06 Asking for change, politely
</h1>
<p>
It seems to me that when the powerful are terrible people and the weak
are trying to articulate their anger, to organize, to get a mass
movement going, asking them to politely make their case and letting
other people make up their mind is not OK. By telling people not to
fight for their rights but to just politely make their point and then
shut up one aligns with the powerful, one dismisses the methods of
resistance.
</p>
<p>
To get a feel for absurd this is, I remember a cartoon I once saw where
American natives gave the conquistadores a list of complaints; where
black Americans gave white Americans a list of civil rights they were
asking for; and so on. And in all cases, the oppressor answered, “oh,
that’s not fair!” or something to that effect and instituted the
necessary changes.
</p>
<p>
It never works that way.
</p>
<p>
For the oppressed to organize, they need the right to speak, to
organize, to meet, to protest.
</p>
<p>
For the oppressor to get spurred into action, it needs to hurt.
</p>
<p>
These days, that means that protests must lead to costs. Otherwise
they’re ignored. It’s as simple as that. Therefore, protest disrupts the
economy, disrupts the flow of goods, damages property. If it doesn’t
cost, it doesn’t hurt. If it doesn’t hurt, it isn’t felt.
</p>
<p>
Also consider all the political theatre that goes on. You can be part of
a grass-roots organisation and fight for change. As far as the situation
in Switzerland is concerned, the government might even invite you to
comment on new draft legislation. But you’re not going to get to write
the proposals. You’re not going to change the system by participating in
meetings. At that point, you’re part of the long arm of the government
reaching into civil society, there to confirm that they have made the
right choices, to do your part in the public performance to assure the
rest of us that everything is OK, everybody has been heard and all
points of view have been accounted for. At that point, it’s too late for
change.
</p>
<p>
The opportunity for change is to be a threat to the establishment, to
undermine the seats of politicians, to cast doubt on their reliability,
to make them unelectable. Then the government starts moving and writes
new proposals to be confirmed by the political theatre in front of a
changed audience.

in defense of Matt Mullenweg and the culture of the developer community
he built over the last 20 years, for better or worse, they don’t do what
Bluesky did. They look for prior art and implement it and they don’t
deprecate. They’re still running the APIs we invented for blogging
before WordPress even existed. The philosophy is “Let’s not argue about
decisions made a long time ago, because <i>we want interop.” </i>People
have all kinds of harsh things to say about their leadership, but unless
you’re a developer you don’t understand that the reason it works is that
they have a different code for their code, the only way we get interop
is by
<a href="http://essaysfromexodus.scripting.com/priorArtDesignMethod">not
re-inventing</a>. There are two competing ways to do things in tech. The
blogging world has been taken over by the re-inventors, like the Bluesky
people. They make a nice product, but honestly they don’t reallllly want
us to work with them, or we wouldn’t be having this friction. Their API
is bullshit. Plain and simple. They even thought of using RSS constructs
and decided to reinvent the whole thing. There are places to innovate,
like new freedom for users and developers, or there are ways to create
<a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/11/14/welcomeToYourHamsterCage.html">hamster
cages</a> where everyone
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=hamster+cage+site%3Ascripting.com">gets</a>
to run around in a very tightly defined space, that’s fun. That’s what
Twitter was about, and that’s what Bluesky is doing too. At some point
we’re really going to break free of this mess, but this isn’t that time,
yet.</p>

crazy thing about Bluesky’s API is they took already standardized things
like links and enclosures, and after 20+ years came up with new
definitions. Makes our apps more expensive to maintain, and we waste
time and human wear and tear on stupid bullshit make-work. Developers
are people, and our work is already horribly overly complex, we’re
working at the edge of comprehension, and what the fukc let’s throw some
more unnecessary complication into the mix. Arrogance, narcissism,
whatever the source is, it’s not a good way to introduce yourself. And,
even better, after you go through the maze they break it, with an error
message about
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/1d0b3163a8441a98e6098a29393ac834">legacy
blob</a> bullshit. They’ve already done this, and they’re just getting
started. It’s why I say they should just adapt to RSS instead of trying
to force us to adapt to them. I’ll do it one more time, and then that’s
it. They can fix my code next time they break it.</p>

<p>We host our websites in Docker containers using Fargate on AWS. This
means we don’t have a permanent file system so we need to use S3 to
store the media files our users upload. Fortunately there is a Django
package to add a variety of different file storage options, including
S3. Setting up S3 via django-storages is pretty straightforward -
install the package, configure storages.backends.s3.S3Storage as the
storage backend, and include AWS access information in your environment
variables.</p>
