With the third season of HBO’s
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13406094/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1" style="font-style: italic;">The
White Lotus</a> the acclaimed and popular series is once again capturing
audience’s imaginations. With its mixture of exotic locales, sexual
intrigue and existential conflict, <span style="font-style: italic;">The
White Lotus</span> has become an event show and not surprising, a fourth
season has already been ordered before the third has even finished
airing.<br><br>At the center of the show is its creator and showrunner:
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0925234/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_0_nm_8_in_0_q_mike%2520white">Mike
White</a>. In addition to his showrunning duties, White writes and
directs every episode of the series. Between its cinematic flourishes
and each season having its own self-contained narrative, <span
style="font-style: italic;">The White Lotus</span> feels more like a 6
to 8 hour-long movie than a traditional TV show. Not surprisingly, prior
to creating <span style="font-style: italic;">The White Lotus</span>,
White was a screenwriter and filmmaker.<br><br>However, his career <span
style="font-style: italic;">did</span> start in TV, and White’s journey
from staff writer to showrunner is an illuminating one. Here are some
lessons screenwriters can learn from the career of Mike White.

At this year’s Oscars, <em>Anora</em> filmmaker Sean Baker made history
by personally receiving 4 Academy Award wins for Best Picture, Best
Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Editing. Only Warren Beatty,
Alan Menken, Alfonso Cuaron and Chloe Zhao had achieved the record 4
nominations for a single film before him. And while the film’s success
has introduced Baker to his biggest audience yet, he’s been steadily
releasing independent films about misfits, immigrants and sex workers on
the margins of American society for 25 years. Here are the 7 films that
paved the way to
<em>Anora</em>. <br><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0259255/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_four%2520letter%2520words" style="font-weight: bold;"></a>

Every year there’s a new wave of screenwriting contests that a
screenwriter can enter in the hopes of getting more eyes on their
feature screenplay or TV pilot. Some of these annual contests, like

Cory Doctorow: There Were Always Enshittifiers</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-03, from: Locus Magazine</p>
<p>
In my new novel <strong>Picks and Shovels</strong>, we learn the origins
of Martin Hench, my bestselling, two-fisted, scambusting forensic
accountant who debuted in 2023’s <strong>Red Team Blues </strong>and
whose adventures continued in 2024’s <strong>The Bezzle</strong>.

<p>
Marty’s origin story starts at MIT in 1982, where he joins the proud
lineage of computer science students who flunk out of their degrees
because they’re too busy hacking code to do their

<strong>Juice</strong>, Tim Winton (Picador 978-1-76134-489-3,
AUD$45.00, 528pp, hc) October 2024. Cover by Adam Laszczuk.
</p>
<p>
Here’s an admission that would elicit a gasp from the Australian
literary elite: I have never read a Tim Winton novel. Worse, I read the
opening of one of his most famous novels and I hated it. But then I read
<strong>Juice. </strong>And if all his novels hit like that for people
who like realism…
