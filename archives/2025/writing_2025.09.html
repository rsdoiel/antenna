At this year’s Oscars, <em>Anora</em> filmmaker Sean Baker made history
by personally receiving 4 Academy Award wins for Best Picture, Best
Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Editing. Only Warren Beatty,
Alan Menken, Alfonso Cuaron and Chloe Zhao had achieved the record 4
nominations for a single film before him. And while the film’s success
has introduced Baker to his biggest audience yet, he’s been steadily
releasing independent films about misfits, immigrants and sex workers on
the margins of American society for 25 years. Here are the 7 films that
paved the way to
<em>Anora</em>. <br><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0259255/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_four%2520letter%2520words" style="font-weight: bold;"></a>

Every year there’s a new wave of screenwriting contests that a
screenwriter can enter in the hopes of getting more eyes on their
feature screenplay or TV pilot. Some of these annual contests, like

A-list management companies and it’s led to many screenwriters

Cory Doctorow: There Were Always Enshittifiers</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-03, from: Locus Magazine</p>
<p>
In my new novel <strong>Picks and Shovels</strong>, we learn the origins
of Martin Hench, my bestselling, two-fisted, scambusting forensic
accountant who debuted in 2023’s <strong>Red Team Blues </strong>and
whose adventures continued in 2024’s <strong>The Bezzle</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Marty’s origin story starts at MIT in 1982, where he joins the proud
lineage of computer science students who flunk out of their degrees
because they’re too busy hacking code to do their

Winton: Review by Alexandra Pierce</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-02, from: Locus Magazine</p>
<p>
<strong>Juice</strong>, Tim Winton (Picador 978-1-76134-489-3,
AUD$45.00, 528pp, hc) October 2024. Cover by Adam Laszczuk.
</p>
<p>
Here’s an admission that would elicit a gasp from the Australian
literary elite: I have never read a Tim Winton novel. Worse, I read the
opening of one of his most famous novels and I hated it. But then I read
<strong>Juice. </strong>And if all his novels hit like that for people
who like realism…
