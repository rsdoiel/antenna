Lee, who searched for 50 years for the son she was forced to give up as a teenager, launched a campaign last week calling on Dublin to pass laws for the release of more than 60,000 adoption files held by the state, private adoption agencies and the Catholic Church. Like thousands of other children, Lee&apos;s son was adopted by an American family, and she said she was overwhelmed by the support her story has generated in the United States. &quot;Philomena&quot; received four Academy Award nominations this month, including one for actress Judi Dench, who plays Lee.

Philomena Lee’s story of being forcibly separated from her toddler son
brought global attention to the horrors of Ireland’s mother and baby
homes. Now 92 and living in the U.K., she could see her government
benefits clawed back if she accepts Ireland’s compensation package.
