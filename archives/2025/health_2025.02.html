insights into freshwater ascomycetes: discovery of novel species in
diverse aquatic habitats</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>During investigations of freshwater fungi in Hunan and Yunnan
provinces, China, Chaetopsina yunnanensis sp. nov. (Nectriaceae),
Parafuscosporella hunanensis sp. nov. (Fuscosporellaceae), and
Pleurotheciella yunnanensis sp. nov. (Pleurotheciaceae) were discovered
on submerged decaying wood and branches. Based on phylogenetic analyses,
C. yunnanensis formed a separate branch with Chaetopsina pinicola and
nested among other Chaetopsina species in Nectriaceae (Hypocreales).
Furthermore, hitherto known Chaetopsina beijingensis shared the same
branch with Chaetopsina fulva, a type species of the genus,
demonstrating their conspecific status. Therefore, C. beijingensis is
formally synonymized under C. fulva, with an amended species
circumscription. Pa. hunanensis formed a well-separated subclade with
the ex-type strain of Parafuscosporella mucosa and clustered with other
Parafuscosporella within Fuscosporellaceae (Fuscosporellales). In
addition, the genus Parafuscosporella is treated as distinct from
Vanakripa due to a lack of phylogenetic evidence in clarifying their
congeneric status with the latter. Pl. yunnanensis is found to be sister
to Pleurotheciella saprophytica, forming a subclade with Pleurotheciella
dimorphospora within the Pleurotheciaceae (Pleurotheciales).
Morphologically, C. yunnanensis fits well with the generic concept of
Chaetopsina in forming a holomorphic state with hyphomycetous asexual
morph producing pigmented, setiform conidiophores, phialidic
conidiogenous cells, hyaline conidia, and nectria-like sexual morph. Pa.
hunanensis fits well with Parafuscosporella in having acrogenous,
apiosporous, versicolored, obovoid to obpyriform conidia. In contrast,
Pl. yunnanensis resembles Pl. dimorphospora in forming asexual
dimorphism with two types of conidia (Type I, brown,
muriform/phragmosporous conidia; Type II, hyaline,
amerosporous/didymorsporous conidia). The novelty of taxa is explained
with detailed descriptions, photo-micrographic illustrations,
polymorphism, and multigene phylogenetic analyses of Bayesian inference
and maximum likelihood criteria.</p>

propionate is a signature of insulin resistance in polycystic ovary
syndrome</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveTo investigate the roles of fecal short-chain fatty acids
(SCFAs) in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).MethodsThe levels of SCFAs
(acetate, propionate, and butyrate) in 83 patients with PCOS and 63
controls were measured, and their relationships with various metabolic
parameters were analyzed. Intestinal microbiome analysis was conducted
to identify relevant bacteria. The study took place at the Center for
Reproductive Medicine at Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University
in Shenyang, from 5 February to 23 May 2023. Logistic regression
analyses were used to investigate the relationships between SCFAs, PCOS,
and PCOS-related insulin resistance (IR). Differences in bacterial
populations between women with PCOS-IR and those with PCOS-non-insulin
resistance (NIR) were identified using linear discriminant analysis
effect Size (LEfSe). The relationships between bacteria and fecal
propionate levels were explored through linear regression analyses. The
potential of fecal propionate and microbial profiles as biomarkers for
insulin resistance in PCOS patients was assessed using receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.ResultsHigher fecal
propionate levels were observed in patients with PCOS compared to
controls (p = 0.042) and in PCOS-IR compared to PCOS-NIR (p = 0.009).
There was no significant difference in fecal propionate levels between
the IR and NIR subgroups of women in the control group (p &gt; 0.05).
Additionally, higher fecal propionate levels were associated with IR in
PCOS (p = 0.039; OR, 1.115; 95% CI, 1.006–1.237). The abundance of
Prevotella copri and Megamonas funiformis was higher in PCOS-IR women
compared to PCOS-NIR women (LDA score &gt; 3) and correlated with fecal
propionate levels (adjusted R² = 0.145, p &lt; 0.001). The area under
the curve (AUC) for propionate and the combined presence of P. copri and
M. funiformis in predicting PCOS was 78.0%, with a sensitivity of 78.5%
and a specificity of 72.4%. Pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism
were significantly enriched in the microbiota of the PCOS-IR population
but not in the control IR group.ConclusionsHigher fecal propionate
levels correlate with PCOS-related insulin resistance. P. copri and M.
funiformis might be key functional bacteria. Therefore, the combination
of propionate levels and the abundance of these two bacteria may serve
as a potential biomarker for insulin resistance in PCOS patients.
Regulation of the intestinal microbiome might be beneficial for the
metabolic health of women with PCOS.</p>

bursal disease virus affecting interferon regulatory factor 7 signaling
through VP3 protein to facilitate viral replication</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)-mediated type I interferon
antiviral response is crucial for regulating the host following viral
infection in chickens. Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) is a
double-stranded RNA virus that induces immune suppression and high
mortality rates in chickens aged 3-6 weeks. Previous studies have shown
that IBDV infection antagonizes the type I interferon production to
facilitate viral replication in the cell, and IRF7 signaling might play
an important role. However, the underlying mechanisms that enable IBDV
to block the IRF7 pathway remain unclear. In this study, we found that
IRF7 and IFN-β expression were suppressed in DF-1 cells during infection
with very virulent IBDV (vvIBDV), but not with attenuated IBDV, while
the virus continued to replicate. Overexpression of IRF7 inhibits IBDV
replication while knocking down IRF7 promotes IBDV replication.
Overexpression of IRF7 couldn’t compensate the IRF7 protein level in
vvIBDV-infected cells, which suggested that IRF7 protein was degraded by
IBDV infection. By using inhibitors, the degradation of IRF7 was found
to be related to the proteasome pathway. Further study revealed that
IRF7 was observed to interact and colocalize with the IBDV VP3 protein.
Consistent with IBDV infection results, IBDV VP3 protein was observed to
inhibit the IRF7-IFN-β expression, affect the degradation of IRF7
protein via proteasome pathway. All these results suggest that the IBDV
exploits IRF7 by affecting its expression and proteasome degradation via
the viral VP3 protein to facilitate viral replication in the cells.
These findings revealed a novel mechanism that IBDV uses to evade host
antiviral defense.</p>

and validation of serum biomarkers in brucellosis patients through
proteomics and bioinformatics</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThis study aims to utilize proteomics, bioinformatics,
and machine learning algorithms to identify diagnostic biomarkers in the
serum of patients with acute and chronic brucellosisMethodsProteomic
analysis was conducted on serum samples from patients with acute and
chronic brucellosis, as well as from healthy controls. Differential
expression analysis was performed to identify proteins with altered
expression, while Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA)
was applied to detect co-expression modules associated with clinical
features of brucellosis. Machine learning algorithms were subsequently
used to identify the optimal combination of diagnostic biomarkers.
Finally, ELISA was employed to validate the identified proteins.ResultsA
total of 1,494 differentially expressed proteins were identified,
revealing two co-expression modules significantly associated with the
clinical characteristics of brucellosis. The Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) algorithm identified six proteins that were concurrently present
in both the differentially expressed and co-expression modules,
demonstrating promising diagnostic potential. After ELISA validation,
five proteins were ultimately selected.DiscussionThese five proteins are
implicated in the innate immune processes of brucellosis, potentially
associated with its pathogenic mechanisms and chronicity. Furthermore,
we highlighted their potential as diagnostic biomarkers for brucellosis.
This study further enhances our understanding of brucellosis at the
protein level, paving the way for future research endeavors.</p>

of antibiotic prophylaxis on gut microbiota in colorectal surgery:
insights from an Eastern European stewardship study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionAntibiotic overuse is driving a global rise in antibiotic
resistance, highlighting the need for robust antimicrobial stewardship
(AMS) initiatives to improve prescription practices. While
antimicrobials are essential for treating sepsis and preventing surgical
site infections (SSIs), they can inadvertently disrupt the gut
microbiota, leading to postoperative complications. Treatment methods
vary widely across nations due to differences in drug choice, dosage,
and therapy duration, affecting antibiotic resistance rates, which can
reach up to 51% in some countries. In Romania and the Republic of
Moldova, healthcare practices for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis differ
significantly despite similarities in genetics, culture, and diet.
Romania’s stricter healthcare regulations result in more standardized
antibiotic protocols, whereas Moldova’s limited healthcare funding leads
to less consistent practices and greater variability in treatment
outcomes.MethodsThis study presents the results of a prospective
cross-border investigation involving 86 colorectal cancer patients from
major oncological hospitals in Romania and Moldova. We analyzed fecal
samples collected from patients before and 7 days post-antibiotic
treatment, focusing on the V3–V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene.ResultsOur
findings indicate that inconsistent antibiotic prophylaxis
policies—varying in type, dosage, or therapy duration—significantly
impacted the gut microbiota and led to more frequent dysbiosis compared
to stricter prophylactic antibiotic practices (single dose, single
product, limited time).DiscussionWe emphasize the need for standardized
antibiotic prophylaxis protocols to minimize dysbiosis and its
associated risks, promoting more effective antimicrobial use,
particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).</p>

identification through bronchoscope in intensive care unit – a
retrospective, databased cohort study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionInvasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) increases the risk
of mortality of critically ill patients. Diagnostic criteria
specifically targeting patients in intensive care units(ICUs) have been
developed to improve diagnostic sensitivity. This study investigated
health outcomes among patients in ICUs with Aspergillus isolates
identified using bronchoscopy.MethodsThis retrospective cohort study
obtained data from the Chang Gung Research Database of Chang Gung
Memorial Hospital. Patients admitted to the ICU between January 2017 and
December 2022 who received bronchoalveolar lavage were enrolled.
Patients with a fungus culture yielding Aspergillus spp. isolates or who
had an Aspergillus galactomannan antigen index value of &gt;1.0 were
categorized into the Aspergillus-positive group.ResultsA total of 2372
patients were enrolled, and 146 patients (6.16%) tested positive for
Aspergillus. Of the patients who tested positive for Aspergillus, 37.67%
had a positive culture result, and 77.4% had a positive galactomannan
antigen result. Patients with Aspergillus isolates were more likely to
have a recent influenza infection, concurrent bacterial sepsis, and a
cavitation and to die in hospital (in-hospital mortality rate 58.9%
vs. 48.57%, P = 0.016).DiscussionIdentifying Aspergillus through
bronchoscopy in the ICU is associated with higher mortality rates than
in patients who test negative for Aspergillus. Galactomannan antigen
from bronchoalveolar lavage may provide higher diagnostic
sensitivity.</p>
