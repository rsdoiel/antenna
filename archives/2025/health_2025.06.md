## Enhanced invasion and survival of antibiotic- resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae pathotypes in host cells and strain-specific replication in blood

date: 2025-02-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundKlebsiella pneumoniae is one of the most important opportunistic pathogens causing healthcare-associated and community-acquired infections worldwide. In recent years, the increase in antibiotic resistance and infections caused by hypervirulent K. pneumoniae poses great public health concerns. In this study, host-pathogen interactions of different K. pneumoniae strains of human and animal origins were analyzed in microbiological, cell-biological and immunological experiments.MethodsIn vitro infection experiments using representatives of different K. pneumoniae pathotypes and various epithelial and macrophage cell lines were executed analyzing adhesion, invasion and intracellular replication. Experimental conditions involved normoxia and hypoxia. Furthermore, survival and growth of further K. pneumoniae isolates expressing defined siderophores in blood (platelet concentrates, serum) was investigated. All experiments were done in triplicate and statistically significant differences were determined.ResultsSignificant differences in adhesion and invasion capability, phagocytosis resistance and intracellular replication were measured between different K. pneumoniae pathotypes. Especially, ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates demonstrated increased invasion in host cell lines and survival in macrophages. A strong cytotoxic effect on intestinal cells was observed for hypervirulent K. pneumoniae. The results from our investigations of the growth behavior of K. pneumoniae in platelets and serum showed that siderophores and/or an enlarged capsule are not essential factors for the proliferation of (hypervirulent) K. pneumoniae strains in blood components.ConclusionOur in vitro experiments revealed new insights into the host-pathogen interactions of K. pneumoniae strains representing different pathovars and clonal lineages in different infectious contexts and hosts. While a clear limitation of our study is the limited strain set used for both infection and as potential host, the results are a further step for a better understanding of the pathogenicity of K. pneumoniae and its properties essential for different stages of colonization and infection. When developed further, these results may offer novel approaches for future therapeutics including novel “anti-virulence strategies”.

## Molecular epidemiology and genetic dynamics of carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae in China

date: 2025-02-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRhvKP) poses a significant global health threat due to its enhanced virulence and resistance. This study analyzed 5,036 publicly available K. pneumoniae genomes from China (2005–2023), identifying 1,538 CRhvKP genomes, accounting for 44.6% of carbapenem-resistant isolates and 69.5% of hypervirulent isolates. Predominant carbapenemases included blaKPC (92.1%), with an increasing prevalence of blaNDM and blaOXA-48-like genes. Most isolates (93.6%) carried both aerobactin and yersiniabactin genes. The genetic background showed high diversity, characterized by 36 sequence types (STs) and 22 capsule types, with high-risk endemic STs such as ST11, ST15, and ST23 being predominant. ST23 demonstrated enhanced virulence, whereas ST11 carried more resistance genes but showed minimal presence of iroBCDN genes. A core genome MLST analysis revealed that 89.0% of CRhvKP isolates clustered into 131 clonal groups, indicating widespread dissemination, particularly in eastern China. CR and hv plasmids, primarily IncF, IncH, and IncR types, showed distinct community structures, with CR plasmids demonstrating higher mobility and diversity. Crucially, we identified 40 CR-hv convergent plasmids across five STs, likely resulting from plasmid fusions, which have become increasingly prevalent in eastern China over the last decade. Furthermore, chromosomal integration of hv genes and blaKPC-2 was detected, underscoring the stable inheritance of these traits. Class 1 Integrons were present in 84.5% of CRhvKP strains, most notably in ST11 and least in ST23. These integrons harbored genes that confer resistance to various antibiotics, including blaIMP and blaVIM, with their content varying across different STs. This study highlights the genetic complexity, rapid dissemination, and increasing prevalence of CRhvKP in China, emphasizing the urgent need for enhanced genomic surveillance and targeted interventions to mitigate the threat posed by these multidrug-resistant and hypervirulent strains.

## Characteristics of gut microbiota and metabolites in extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and their prognostic value for resectable lesions

date: 2025-02-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between gut microbiota composition, fecal metabolites, and postoperative prognosis in patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (eCCA). A total of 53 patients with resectable eCCA and 21 healthy volunteers as a control group were included. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomic analyses revealed significant differences in the gut microbial community structure and altered fecal metabolites profiles between eCCA patients and healthy controls. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses indicated that factors such as preoperative total bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, and specific metabolites were closely associated with overall survival in patients with eCCA post-surgery. The constructed nomogram model further demonstrated the predictive value of these factors, achieving a C-index of 0.718, with calibration curves confirming its strong predictive performance. In conclusion, gut microbiota composition and fecal metabolites play a crucial role in the surgical prognosis of eCCA patients, providing new insights for clinical prognostic assessment.

## ChPDIA3 targeted by miR-126-x and miR-21-y responds to Vibrio harveyi infection in Crassostrea hongkongensis

date: 2025-02-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe Hong Kong oyster (Crassostrea hongkongensis), as the main marine aquaculture shellfish in the South China Sea, not only has high economic and ecological value, but also is an ideal model for conducting research on pathogen-host interactions. In the cultivation process of C. hongkongensis, there is a challenge posed by vibrios. To improve the antibacterial strains of C. hongkongensis, we have studied the gene associated with immunity, PDIA3. Methods and findingsIn this study, we cloned the PDIA3 sequence of the C. hongkongensis, using the RACE technique. It has a total of 2081 bp and contains a 5'-UTR of 55 bp and a 3'-UTR of 547 bp. The ChPDIA3 gene sequence has an ORF frame that is 1479 bp in length and encodes 492 amino acids. Analysis of the phylogenetic tree constructed by Neighbor Joining method showed that ChPDIA3 clustered with other shellfishes into a single unit, which was consistent with the law of species evolution. DiscussionThe highest expression of ChPDIA3 was detected in gill tissues of the C. hongkongensis using RT-qPCR, and significantly higher expression in V. harveyi and LPS infection than Poly(I:C) (P<0.05). This may indicate that ChPDIA3 is primarily involved in the immune response against bacterial infections in the C. hongkongensis. The binding sites of miR-126-x, miR-21-y and ChPDIA3 were detected using dual luciferase experiments, respectively. The results showed that both miR-126-x and miR-21-y inhibited the 3'-UTR region of ChPDIA3. This suggested that both miR-126-x and miR-21-y inhibited ChPDIA3 expression. This study will help to further understand the function of ChPDIA3 in response to pathogen infection, thus providing new ideas for understanding the resistance and adaptation of the C. hongkongensis to Vibrio infection.

## Global burden of reported lower respiratory system fungal infection

date: 2025-02-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundThe epidemiological trend of lower respiratory tract fungal infections remains unclear. This study aims to quantify the global burden of these infections from 1990 to 2021 using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.MethodsData were analyzed at global, regional, and national levels, considering factors such as age, gender, region, and socio-demographic index (SDI). Key indicators included age-standardized disability-adjusted life-year (ASDR) and age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR).ResultsOn a global scale, the burden of lower respiratory fungal infections decreased significantly from 1990 to 2021, with a decline in mortality rates. Regionally, substantial disparities were observed among the 21 geographic super-regions. Nationally, Argentina experienced the greatest increase in ASDR and ASMR, while Finland showed the largest decrease, with average annual percentage changes (AAPC) below -5 for both indicators. Sex-based analysis revealed a notably higher burden in males compared to females. ASDR and ASMR were negatively correlated with SDI in most regions.ConclusionAlthough the global burden of lower respiratory tract fungal infections has decreased, it remains a substantial public health issue, particularly in low-SDI regions. There is an urgent need to implement targeted preventive measures to address this ongoing challenge.

## Cell signaling in Ehrlichia infection and cancer: Parallels in pathogenesis

date: 2025-02-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Ehrlichia chaffeensis (E. chaffeensis) has recently emerged as an intracellular bacterial pathogen with sophisticated survival mechanisms that include repurposing evolutionarily conserved eukaryotic cell signaling pathways for immune evasion. E. chaffeensis exploits four major developmental signaling pathways (Wnt, Notch, Hedgehog, and Hippo) using short linear motif (SLiM) ligand mimicry to initiate signaling cascades. Dysregulation of these major signaling pathways leading to unchecked cell survival is implicated in various diseases, most notably cancer. E. chaffeensis exploits Wnt, Notch, Hedgehog and Hippo signaling pathways to inhibit apoptosis and co-opt other cellular functions to promote infection. This review will explore the signaling pathways exploited during Ehrlichia infection and the new discoveries that have illuminated this interesting example of the cell signaling convergence in cellular infection and cancer biology.

## A chionodracine-derived peptide, KHS-Cnd, as an anti-virulence agent against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii clinical strains

date: 2025-02-14, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

About 71% of healthcare-associated infections are due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria, such as carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii, classified by World Health Organization into a critical priority group of pathogens. The antimicrobial resistance profile of A. baumannii relies on its ability to produce several virulence factors, including biofilm formation. Its ability to adhere and persist on surfaces as biofilm has contributed to its pathogenicity and drug resistance. In this study, the ability of an antimicrobial peptide (a chionodracine-derived peptide named KHS-Cnd) to inhibit or reduce biofilm formation was investigated as an example of a potential strategy to counteract infections caused by biofilm-forming pathogens. To this aim, the antimicrobial profiles were first analyzed in selected A. baumannii strains, two reference and six clinical strains, all biofilm-forming with different capability, regardless of whether they are drug resistant or sensitive. Successively, we investigated the bactericidal activity of the peptide that showed MIC values ranging from 5 to 10 µM and a significative antibiofilm activity on all tested strains at sub-inhibitory concentrations. In fact, KHS-Cnd can hinder biofilm A. baumannii strains formation with an inhibition percentage ranging between 65% and 10%. Also a statistically significant reduction of mature biofilm ranging from 20% to 50% was observed in four out of eight tested A. baumannii strains. KHS-Cnd impacts various stages of biofilm formation, including the inhibition of surface-associated and twitching motilities depending on the different strain. In particular, our results showed that only two strains possessed surface-associated motility that was strongly impaired by KHS-Cnd treatment; three clinical strains, instead, showed twitching motility, whose inhibition for two of them was evident after 24 h of incubation with peptide. Moreover, the invasion of pulmonary cells by A. baumannii was significantly impaired with a reduction of about 32% after treatment with 1.25 µM KHS-Cnd. Finally, when the peptide was used together with ceftazidime/avibactam against resistant A. baumannii strains, it was able to reduce the minimal inhibitory concentration of antibiotics needed to inhibit the microorganism growth.

## Trajectory of gut microbiota before and after pediatric cardiopulmonary bypass surgery

date: 2025-02-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundVaried congenital heart disease (CHD) may induce gut microbiota dysbiosis due to intestinal hypoperfusion or/and hypoxemia. Microbiota dysbiosis has been found in preoperative infants and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) exacerbated it further. However, the trajectory of gut microbiota from pre- to early post-CPB and one-year later remains unexplored. We examined this trajectory in the two most common CHDs, i.e., left-to-right shunt (ventricular septal defect, VSD) vs. right-to-left shunt (tetralogy of Fallot, TOF).MethodsWe enrolled 13 infants with VSD and 11 with TOF, and collected fecal samples at pre- and early post-CPB. 10 and 12 age- and gender-matched healthy control infants were enrolled respectively. We also enrolled 13 and 9 gender- and CHD diagnosis- and operation-matched one-year post-CPB patients, and 8 age- and gender-matched healthy control children. 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal samples were performed.ResultsCompared to the control groups, both VSD and TOF pre-CPB groups had significantly increased Enterobacteriaceae and Shigella, and decreased Bifidobacterium (Ps ≤ 0.049). No significant change in microbial community diversity was observed between pre- and early post-CPB periods (Ps≥0.227). Compared with early post-CPB, one-year post-CPB groups had significantly increased short-chain fatty acids-producing microbes (Ps ≤ 0.025), and their microbial communities were close to that of the control group (Ps≥0.102). There was no significant difference in microbial communities between VSD and TOF groups in any of 3 periods (Ps≥0.055).ConclusionIn children with VSD or TOF, gut microbiota dysbiosis existed preoperatively and were not significantly altered by CPB. One-year post-CPB, microbiota significantly improved towards normal. Similar microbial communities were found between children with VSD and TOF throughout the perioperative and long-term postoperative periods.

## Neurological and immunological characteristics of a novel immortalized bovine brainstem-derived cell line and its susceptibility to arbovirus infection

date: 2025-02-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Immortalized bovine neuronal cell lines provide a reliable in vitro model for studying interactions with bovine infectious pathogens that target the host nervous system. Although we previously established an immortalized fetal bovine brain-derived FBBC-1 cell line, there are currently no other bovine neuronal cell lines commonly available. In the present study, we developed a novel immortalized cell line, IKBM, derived from the adult bovine brainstem by transferring a SV40 large T antigen gene using lentiviral vectors, and compared its characteristics to the FBBC-1 cell line. As with FBBC-1 cells, IKBM cells extended neurite-like processes in response to agents that increase cytosolic cyclic AMP levels. A comprehensive analysis using RNA sequencing demonstrated that both cell lines potentially possess neural progenitor cell-like properties and differentiate into dopaminergic neuron-like cells after induction of the outgrowth of neurite-like processes. Unexpectedly, we found that the mRNAs of multiple immunomodulatory molecules were highly expressed in IKBM cells, but not in FBBC-1 cells. Although IKBM cells were susceptible to infection with arboviruses (Akabane and Chuzan viruses) that cause neurological symptoms in cattle, viral titers were lower in IKBM cell cultures than in hamster lung-derived HmLu-1 cell cultures, which are frequently used to isolate arboviruses. The reduced production of viruses in IKBM cell cultures may be related to the high expression of immunomodulatory molecules in these cells. Therefore, IKBM and FBBC-1 cell lines offer the opportunity to develop unique in vitro models of the bovine nervous system for the study of host-pathogen interactions based on their respective properties.

## Efficacy and safety of Saccharomyces boulardii as an adjuvant therapy for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori: a meta-analysis

date: 2025-02-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundHelicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is highly prevalent worldwide and is closely associated with many gastric conditions. Current methods for eradicating H. pylori include triple or quadruple therapy, including antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, and bismuth agents; however, with antibiotic abuse and increased drug resistance rates, the effectiveness of traditional methods is gradually decreasing, with many adverse effects such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and intolerance. In recent years, there has been controversy regarding whether adding Saccharomyces boulardii (S. boulardii) to traditional therapies is beneficial for eradicating H. pylori.AimTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of S. boulardii as an adjuvant therapy for the eradication of H. pylori.MethodsWe systematically searched the PubMed and Web of Science databases from January 2002 to January 2023. The primary outcome was the H. pylori eradication rate. The secondary outcomes included total adverse effects, abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloating, constipation, nausea, vomiting, taste disorders, and other adverse reactions. We evaluated the included studies for publication bias and heterogeneity. Fixed- and random-effects models were used for studies without and with heterogeneity, respectively, to calculate the risk ratios (RRs) and conduct sensitivity and subgroup analyses.ResultsNineteen studies comprising 5,036 cases of H. pylori infection were included in this meta-analysis. The addition of S. boulardii to traditional therapy significantly improved the H. pylori eradication rate [RR=1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08–1.15] and reduced the incidence of total adverse effects (RR=0.49, 95% CI: 0.37–0.66), diarrhea (RR=0.36, 95% CI: 0.26–0.48), abdominal distension (RR=0.49, 95% CI: 0.33–0.72), constipation (RR=0.38, 95% CI: 0.26–0.57), and nausea (RR=0.50, 95% CI: 0.37–0.68). However, it did not reduce the occurrence of abdominal pain, vomiting, or taste disorders.ConclusionsS. boulardii supplementation in traditional eradication therapy significantly improves the H. pylori eradication rate and reduces the total adverse effects and incidence of diarrhea, bloating, constipation, and nausea.Systematic review registrationProspero, identifier CRD42024549780.

## Disruption of zinc homeostasis reverses tigecycline resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae

date: 2025-02-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionZinc exhibits potent antimicrobial properties due to its ability to compromise bacterial structure and protein functionality, effectively inhibiting and eradicating bacteria. However, bacteria have evolved mechanisms to expel excess zinc ions from their cells, enabling them to thrive in environments rich in metal ions at high concentrations. This evolutionary advancement limits the clinical application of metal ions as antimicrobial agents. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential of zinc ionophores to overcome bacterial resistance by elevating intracellular zinc ion levels.MethodsWe employed the zinc ionophore PBT2 to elevate intracellular zinc ion levels in Klebsiella pneumoniae, a bacterium known for its resistance to various antibiotics. By treating K. pneumoniae with PBT2, we aimed to assess its impact on bacterial resistance to tigecycline, an antibiotic commonly used in clinical settings. The changes in intracellular zinc ion levels, superoxide dismutase activity, reactive oxygen species concentration, and cell wall synthesis pathway were monitored to evaluate the mechanism of action of PBT2.ResultsOur results revealed that PBT2 successfully reversed the resistance of K. pneumoniae to tigecycline. Specifically, PBT2 increased the concentration of intracellular zinc ions in K. pneumoniae, leading to a suppression of superoxide dismutase activity within the cell and an elevation of reactive oxygen species concentration. These changes impaired the oxidative stress response of the bacteria. Additionally, the disruption of zinc homeostasis significantly inhibited the cell wall synthesis pathway in K. pneumoniae, potentially restricting the efflux pump mechanism that predominantly drives tigecycline resistance.DiscussionThe findings of this study pave the way for innovative strategies and approaches in the clinical development of novel antimicrobial agents. By using zinc ionophores such as PBT2 to elevate intracellular zinc ion levels, we can overcome bacterial resistance to antibiotics like tigecycline. The suppression of superoxide dismutase activity and elevation of reactive oxygen species concentration suggest that PBT2 impairs the oxidative stress response of K. pneumoniae, further enhancing its susceptibility to antibiotics. Furthermore, the inhibition of the cell wall synthesis pathway and restriction of the efflux pump mechanism provide additional mechanisms by which PBT2 reverses antibiotic resistance. These results highlight the potential of zinc ionophores as a novel class of antimicrobial agents and warrant further investigation into their clinical applications.

## Human reference microbiome profiles of different body habitats in healthy individuals

date: 2025-02-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThis study aimed to establish the human reference microbiome profiles in blood, saliva, and stool of healthy individuals, serving as reference values to identify microbiome alterations in human disease.MethodsThe study population consisted of a reference group of healthy adults and a second group consisting of adults with periodontal disease (PD). Blood, saliva, and stool samples were subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing. Reference intervals of alpha diversity indices were calculated. To reduce the effects of inherent limitations of microbiome data, the taxonomic profiles of the reference group were estimated as log-scaled fold change (logFC) in the abundance of microorganisms between two habitats within the subjects. ResultsFor stool and saliva microbiomes, differences in the abundances of Firmicutes, Patescibacteria, and Verrucomicrobia distinguished healthy from PD subjects (95% confidence interval (CI) of logFC: [−0.18, 0.31], [−1.19, −0.34], and [−3.68, −2.90], respectively). Differences in the abundances of Cyanobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Tenericutes in stool and blood microbiome of healthy subjects fell within 95% CI of logFC [−0.38, 0.61], [−4.14, −3.01], and [1.66, 2.77], respectively. In saliva and blood, differences in the abundances of Epsilonbacteraeota, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, and Proteobacteria could be used as reference values (95% CI of logFC: [−3.67, −2.47], [−0.35, 0.49], [−4.59, −3.26], and [−1.20, 0.07], respectively).DiscussionAs the reference microbiome profiles could discern healthy subjects and individuals with PD, a relatively mild disease state, they can be applied as reference values representing the healthy status of the microbiome and for screening of disease states, preferably in preclinical stages.

## Vascular endothelial growth factor A: friend or foe in the pathogenesis of HIV and SARS-CoV-2 infections?

date: 2025-02-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

This review article discusses the role of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV infection, both conditions being renowned for their impact on the vascular endothelium. The processes involved in vascular homeostasis and angiogenesis are reviewed briefly before exploring the interplay between hypoxia, VEGF-A, neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), and inflammatory pathways. We then focus on SARS-CoV-2 infection and show how the binding of the viral pathogen to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, as well as to NRP-1, leads to elevated levels of VEGF-A and consequences such as coagulation, vascular dysfunction, and inflammation. HIV infection augments angiogenesis via several mechanisms, most prominently, by the trans-activator of transcription (tat) protein mimicking VEGF-A by binding to its receptor, VEGFR-2, as well as upregulation of NRP-1, which enhances the interaction between VEGF-A and VEGFR-2. We propose that the elevated levels of VEGF-A observed during HIV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection originate predominantly from activated immune cells due to the upregulation of HIF-1α by damaged endothelial cells. In this context, a few clinical trials have described a diminished requirement for oxygen therapy during anti-VEGF treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The currently available anti-VEGF therapy strategies target the binding of VEGF-A to both VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. The blocking of both receptors could, however, lead to a negative outcome, inhibiting not only pathological, but also physiological angiogenesis. Based on the examination of published studies, this review suggests that treatment targeting selective inhibition of VEGFR-1 may be beneficial in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

## Discovery of amino acid substitutions in penicillin-binding proteins associated with adaptation to D-Ala-D-Lac in vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis

date: 2025-02-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The bacterial cell wall, essential for structural integrity, is synthesized with penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) evades vancomycin by replacing D-Ala-D-Ala in their cell wall precursors with D-Ala-D-Lac, reducing the drug’s effectiveness. However, how PBPs-which typically use D-Ala-D-Ala as a substrate-adapt to recognize D-Ala-D-Lac remains unclear. Here, we performed Sanger sequencing and alignment of PBP genes from both vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant E. faecalis strains to identify mutations, following amplification by PCR. We then applied homology modeling to assess structural impacts of these changes on PBPs and conducted docking studies to investigate ligand-binding interactions. For the first time, we identified specific adaptations in certain VRE PBPs that may facilitate the D-Ala-D-Lac utilization. We found that PBP1B, PBP2A, PBP3 showed changes, while PBP1A, PBP2B and PBP4 remained unchanged. Notably, a threonine-to-asparagine substitution at location 491 in PBP1B leads to a shift in substrate preference from D-Ala-D-Ala to D-Ala-D-Lac. Similar structural changes in PBP3 suggest that the presence of changed and unchanged PBPs within the same classes suggests compensatory interactions, indicating a teamwork among multiple PBPs. These insights into PBPs provide a deeper understanding of D-Ala-D-Lac utilization in VRE, may be used to develop new therapeutic agents to combat vancomycin resistance.

## Distinct vaginal microbiome and metabolome profiles in women with preterm delivery following cervical cerclage

date: 2025-02-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Preterm birth (PTB) is a major cause of infant morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of vaginal microbiota and metabolites on the outcome of pregnant women. In this study, a total of 127 pregnant women provided written informed consent prior to enrollment in accordance with the approved institutional guidelines, but only 45 pregnancies met the experimental requirements, and then blood and cervical vaginal fluid (CVF) samples were collected before delivery (at the second week after cervical cerclage). Pregnant women with PTB exhibited high white blood cell and neutrophil contents, high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and high systemic inflammation response index (SIRI) in the blood. Vaginal microbiome revealed that the proportion of beneficial bacteria (including Lactobacillus, [Ruminococcus] gnavus group, and Megamonas) significantly decreased in the PTB group, and the proportion of harmful bacteria (including Desulfovibrionaceae, Helicobacter, and Gardnerella) significantly increased, which is strongly related to the biochemical parameters of blood (white blood cells, neutrophils, NLR, and SIRI). In addition, vaginal metabolomics-based liquid chromatography–Orbitrap–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-Orbitrap-MS/MS) found that the alteration in vaginal metabolites in pregnant women with PTB is involved in starch and sucrose metabolism; arginine and praline metabolism; galactose metabolism; purine metabolism; arginine metabolism; tryptophan metabolism and N-glycan biosynthesis; cysteine and methionine metabolism; taurine and hypotaurine metabolism; amino acid metabolism; propanoate metabolism; valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis; glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism; and steroid hormone biosynthesis. These results elaborated that distinct vaginal microbiome and metabolome profiles in women with preterm delivery following cervical cerclage provide valuable information for establishing the prediction models for PTB.

IntroductionAccurate prediction of immunogenic proteins is crucial for vaccine development and understanding host-pathogen interactions in bacterial diseases, particularly for Salmonella infections which remain a significant global health challenge.MethodsWe developed SHASI-ML, a machine learning-based framework for predicting immunogenic proteins in Salmonella species. The model was trained and validated using a curated dataset of experimentally verified immunogenic and non-immunogenic proteins. Three distinct feature groups were extracted from protein sequences: global properties, sequence-derived features, and structural information. The Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm was employed for model development and optimization.ResultsSHASI-ML demonstrated robust performance in identifying bacterial immunogens, achieving 89.3% precision and 91.2% specificity. When applied to the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium proteome, the model identified 292 novel immunogenic protein candidates. Global properties emerged as the most influential feature group in prediction accuracy, followed by structural and sequence information. The model showed superior recall and F1-scores compared to existing computational approaches.DiscussionThese findings establish SHASI-ML as an efficient computational tool for prioritizing immunogenic candidates in Salmonella vaccine development. By streamlining the identification of vaccine candidates early in the development process, this approach significantly reduces experimental burden and associated costs. The methodology can be applied to guide and optimize both research and industrial-scale production of Salmonella vaccines, potentially accelerating the development of more effective immunization strategies.

## The advancement of nanosystems for drug delivery in the prevention and treatment of dental caries

date: 2025-02-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The dental caries remains a globally prevalent disease. Although its incidence has decrease due to enhancements in sanitation policies and public health measures, the treatment and prevention of dental caries still pose significant challenges. Within the oral cavity, traditional drug delivery systems suffer from limitation such as inadequate tissue penetration, short duration of action at target site, and low specificity, which minimally affect the prevention and treatment of dental caries. Consequently, nanosystem for drug delivery, offering enhanced drug stability, solubility, and bio-availability while reducing side effects, garnering attention increasing attention in the fight against dental caries. Therefore, this review examines the role of nanosystems for drug delivery in combating dental caries by inhibiting bacteria survival, biofilm formation, demineralization, and promoting remineralization, and exploring their potential to become the mainstream means of prevention and treatment of dental caries in future.

## Gut microbiota dysfunction in Crohn’s disease

date: 2025-02-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionCrohn’s disease (CD) results from alterations in the gut microbiota and the immune system. However, the exact metabolic dysfunctions of the gut microbiota during CD are still unclear. Here, we investigated metagenomic functions using PICRUSt2 during the course of CD to better understand microbiota-related disease mechanisms and provide new insights for novel therapeutic strategies.MethodsWe performed 16S rRNA-based microbial profiling of 567 faecal samples collected from a cohort of 383 CD patients, including 291 remissions (CR), 177 mild-moderate (CM) and 99 severe (CS) disease states. Gene and pathway composition was assessed using PICRUSt2 analyses of 16S data.ResultsAs expected, changes in alpha and beta diversity, in interaction networks and increases in Proteobacteria abundance were associated with disease severity. However, microbial function was more consistently disrupted than composition from CR, to CM and then to CS. Major shifts in oxidative stress pathways and reduced carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism in favour of nutrient transport were identified in CS compared to CR. Virulence factors involved in host invasion, host evasion and inflammation were also increased in CS.ConclusionsThis functional metagenomic information provides new insights into community-wide microbial processes and pathways associated with CD pathogenesis. This study paves the way for new advanced strategies to rebalance gut microbiota and/or eliminate oxidative stress, and biofilm to downregulate gut inflammation.

## Microbial dysbiosis in periodontitis and peri-implantitis: pathogenesis, immune responses, and therapeutic

date: 2025-02-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The oral microbiome comprises over 700 distinct species, forming complex biofilms essential for maintaining oral and systemic health. When the microbial homeostasis in the periodontium is disrupted, pathogens within the biofilm can cause periodontitis and peri-implantitis, inducing host immune responses. Understanding the role of microbial communities and the immune mechanisms in oral health and disease is crucial for developing improved preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. However, many questions remain about how changes in bacterial populations contribute to the development and progression of these conditions. An electronic and manual literature search was conducted using PubMed, Excerpta Medica, Frontiers Reports and the Wiley Online Library databases for relevant articles. Data from these publications were extracted and the overall findings were summarized in a narrative manner. The variations in microbial communities and immune responses of periodontitis and peri-implantitis are explored. Dysbiosis of the subgingival microbiome—characterized by an increase in pathogenic bacteria such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans—plays a pivotal role in the initiation and progression of periodontitis. As for peri-implantitis, alterations include a higher abundance of opportunistic pathogens and reduced microbial diversity around implants. Moreover, oral dysbiosis potentially influencing systemic health through immune-mediated pathways. Regional immunity of periodontium involving neutrophils, T helper cells-17, and immune-related cytokines is crucial for maintaining periodontal homeostasis and responding to microbial imbalances. Additionally, the impact of non-mechanical treatments—such as probiotics and laser therapy—on the oral microbiome is discussed, demonstrating their potential in managing microbial dysbiosis. These findings underscore that bacterial dysbiosis is a central factor in the development of periodontitis and peri-implantitis. Maintaining microbial balance is essential for preventing these diseases, and interventions targeting the microbiome could enhance treatment outcomes. Strategies focusing on controlling pathogenic bacteria, modulating immune responses, and promoting tissue regeneration are key to restoring periodontal stability. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying the transition from peri-implant mucositis to peri-implantitis and to optimize prevention and treatment approaches, considering the complex interactions between the microbiome and host immunity.

## Current and future therapeutic options for chronic hepatitis D virus infection

date: 2025-02-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

In the last few years there have been innovations in HDV therapy which have brought new excitement in the scientific community also considering the few therapeutic opportunities. Recently, new molecular targets have been identified, both in monotherapy and in combination with peginterferon alpha (PegIFNα). Evaluating this review of the literature of the last ten years, HDV-related chronic hepatitis seems to have become a potentially curable disease, a statement that was unthinkable a few years ago. There are old and new weapons at our disposal. The old weapons are PegIFNα and recently PegIFN-lambda (PegIFNλ). PegIFNα, for which there are more data, appears to be an excellent combination regimen, if not contraindicated, both for Bulevirtide (BLV), data supported by important clinical trials and real-world studies, and probably for lonarfanib, although in the latter case the results are not yet definitive as the studies are fewer. However, data on long-term follow-up are needed.

## Comprehensive analysis of the mechanisms conferring resistance to phenamacril in the Fusarium species

date: 2025-02-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The filamentous fungal genus Fusarium contains many species that cause catastrophic diseases in fruits, cereal, and vegetables. These diseases cause substantial losses in yield and contaminate affected crops with toxins. This causes huge losses in the agricultural sector and threatens human and animal health. The most efficient approach to control the Fusarium spp. is fungicide application. Phenamacril is a site-specific fungicide that exerts its antifungal effect on sensitive Fusarium spp. It is a new fungicide developed that targets Fusarium graminearum by inhibiting myosin-5, an important protein in fungal growth and disease development. Because of its remarkable specificity, the new fungicide phenamacril is regarded as environmentally benign. However, many research findings have reported the emergence of the resistance of Fusarium spp. to phenamacril in both the field and laboratory. This article comprehensively analyzes the mechanisms underlying Fusarium spp. resistance to phenamacril. We examine the molecular, genetic, and environmental factors contributing to this resistance. We emphasize the importance of continued research and integrating different approaches to monitoring and managing drug-resistant Fusarium spp. populations. Integrating current inventions to inform strategies for sustainable disease control practices, and increase plant health, and yield will contribute to ongoing global efforts to achieve food and nutritional sustainability for the world's rapidly growing population while ensuring the effectiveness of the fungicidal product.

## Role of E-cadherin in epithelial barrier dysfunction: implications for bacterial infection, inflammation, and disease pathogenesis

date: 2025-02-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Epithelial barriers serve as critical defense lines against microbial infiltration and maintain tissue homeostasis. E-cadherin, an essential component of adherens junctions, has emerged as a pivotal molecule that secures epithelial homeostasis. Lately, its pleiotropic role beyond barrier function, including its involvement in immune responses, has become more evident. Herein, we delve into the intricate relationship between (dys)regulation of epithelial homeostasis and the versatile functionality of E-cadherin, describing complex mechanisms that underlie barrier integrity and disruption in disease pathogenesis such as bacterial infection and inflammation, among others. Clinical implications of E-cadherin perturbations in host pathophysiology are emphasized; downregulation, proteolytic phenomena, abnormal localization/signaling and aberrant immune reactions are linked with a broad spectrum of pathology beyond infectious diseases. Finally, potential therapeutic interventions that may harness E-cadherin to mitigate barrier-associated tissue damage are explored. Overall, this review highlights the crucial role of E-cadherin in systemic health, offering insights that could pave the way for strategies to reinforce/restore barrier integrity and treat related diseases.

## Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants in Henan, China from 2023 to 2024

date: 2025-02-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveIn January 2023, China implemented the “Class B Management” policy, marking a new phase in COVID-19 control. As new SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge, some have shown significant immune evasion, posing challenges to epidemic control efforts. To manage the pandemic effectively, Henan Province launched a surveillance program for SARS-CoV-2 variants, systematically analyzing their clinical characteristics and epidemiological patterns.MethodsThis study collected genomic sequence data from 5,965 COVID-19 cases between January 1, 2023, and March 17, 2024, using the Henan Province SARS-CoV-2 variant surveillance system. Genome sequence analysis was performed with CLC Genomics Workbench, and genotyping and sequence alignment were carried out using the Nextclade platform. The clinical severity of different variants was assessed in relation to patient sex, age, clinical classification, and vaccination status.ResultsBetween Week 1 of 2023 and Week 11 of 2024, a total of 5,965 complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were obtained, including 3,004 male (50.36%) and 2,961 female (49.64%) cases. The majority of cases were mild (5,451 cases, 91.38%), followed by moderate (311 cases, 5.21%) and severe or critical cases (203 cases, 3.4%). The predominant variants included BA.5.2, XBB, and BA.2.86. BA.5.2 was dominant until April 2023, after which it was gradually replaced by XBB. From December 2023, BA.2.86 began to increase and became the predominant variant by January 2024. The XBB variant exhibited a significantly lower rate of severe cases, with most infections being mild (P < 0.05). Male patients, the elderly, and certain variants (e.g., BA.5.2) were associated with more severe outcomes, while XBB and BA.2.86 showed lower pathogenicity, with a marked reduction in severe and fatal cases (P < 0.05).ConclusionAs SARS-CoV-2 variants evolve, the incidence of severe cases has progressively decreased. Both XBB and BA.2.86 variants exhibit lower pathogenicity. This study provides vital scientific evidence on the epidemiological features, clinical manifestations, and control strategies of SARS-CoV-2 variants. It underscores the importance of continuous viral surveillance and genomic sequencing to guide public health decision-making.

## Analytical and clinical validation of a novel MeltPlus TB-NTM/RIF platform for simultaneous detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, Non-Tuberculous Mycobacteria and rifampicin resistance

date: 2025-02-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundRapid and accurate diagnosis of tuberculosis, particularly rifampin (RIF)-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB) and Non-Tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM), is essential for implementing appropriate proper therapy to benefit patients and improve TB/NTM patient management.MethodsIn this study, we developed a novel MeltPlus MTB-NTM/RIF platform, designed to simultaneously detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), NTM and RIF resistance. The platform was evaluated for its limit of detection (LOD) and specificity before clinical validation, followed by a prospective single-center study in patients with presumptive TB cases.ResultsThe calculated LOD for MTBC, NTM and RIF susceptibility was found to be 10.31 CFU/mL, 57.55 CFU/mL and 48.584 CFU/mL, respectively. The assay showed a sensitivity of 98.76% (95% CI: 96.41-99.74%) and a specificity of 94.42% (95% CI: 90.82-96.92%) for MTBC detection compared to the bacteriological TB standard. For NTM detection, the assay demonstrated a sensitivity of 91.98% (95% CI: 76.32-98.14%) and a specificity of 99.59% (95% CI: 98.54-99.95%). RIF resistance detection showed a sensitivity of 90.24% (95% CI:76.87-97.28%) and specificity of 95.98% (95% CI: 91.89-98.37%), with a high level of diagnostic agreement (Kappa: 0.8338) compared to GeneXpert. Sanger sequencing revealed that novel assay correctly classifies 98.6% of study cases as RIF resistant or susceptible, slightly higher that of GeneXpert.DiscussionThese findings indicate that the novel MeltPlus MTB-NTM/RIF platform provides a rapid and accurate method for the simultaneously detecting MTBC, NTM, and RIF resistance, making it a promising tool for clinical TB/NTM diagnosis and management, further multi-center and field studies are recommended to validate its broader applicability.
