<h2 id="closeout-sale-on-our-roubo-volumes">Closeout Sale on Our Roubo
Volumes</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-07, from: Lost Arg Press blog</p>
<p>We are closing out the last 400 (or so) copies of our two
translations of A-J Roubo’s “l’Art du menuisier” in order to make room
for new editions of these books. The savings are significant. Act
quickly to avoid disappointment. “With All the Precision Possible: Roubo
on Furniture” is now $21 (on sale from $63)….</p>

Development</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-06, from: Lost Arg Press blog</p>
<p>Thanks to a clever idea from our friend Roger Davis, we’re well on
the way to once again offering Crucible Tool Pinch Rods (the brass on
our former offering has become prohibitively expensive). Shown here is
the second prototype. They work, but not as perfectly as possible, so
we’re still working with Craig Jackson at…</p>

‘Roubo on Furniture’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: Lost Arg Press blog</p>
<p>Ever since we sold out of the original 12″ x 17″ deluxe editions of
“With All Precision Possible: Roubo on Furniture,” Chris has been
itching to do another luxurious book…if perhaps not <em>quite</em> so
extravagant (the almost-full-folio size of that edition was crazy
expensive). Instead, we’re working on a new quarto-size edition (9″ x
12″),…</p>

<h2 id="wood-structure-classification-of-trees">Wood Structure &amp;
Classification of Trees</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: Lost Arg Press blog</p>
<p>The following is excerpted from the third edition of Christian
Becksvoort’s “With the Grain: A Craftsman’s Guide to Understanding
Wood.”  It is, above all, succinct, easy to understand and perfectly
suited for the furniture-maker. As important as what is in its 160 pages
is what is not. It’s not a detailed analysis of cell growth….</p>

Book Without Wrecking It</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, from: Lost Arg Press blog</p>
<p>A few years back (OK – more than a decade ago), we shared designer
Wesley Tanner’s instructions for opening a new book with a sewn binding:
“The first thing I do when I get a book like this with sewn signatures
is to ‘open it up.’ I remove the jacket off and lay the book…</p>
