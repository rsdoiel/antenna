2025 announcement in one place</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-28, updated: 2025-07-28, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>The 2025 edition of San Diego Comic-Con was relatively muted: Marvel
skipped Hall H in favor of releasing The Fantastic Four: First Steps in
all its standalone-thrills-but-pivotal-end-credits-scene glory while
James Gunn only popped by to promote Peacemaker season 2, but nothing
more from his larger Warner Bros./DCU initiative. But the absence of two
major players […]</p>

Kong Bananza’s identity crisis doesn’t get in the way of good time</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-28, updated: 2025-07-25, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>I’m not surprised smashing stuff in Donkey Kong Bananza is enjoyable.
In the tutorial alone, I, like many others, spent ages demolishing
everything I could get my (giant gorilla) hands on, and it’s a given
that something designed well enough to distract from the main attraction
like that is still going to feel good 10 […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-28, updated: 2025-07-27, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Wisdom of Sea and Sky is the next expansion in Pokémon TCG Pocket,
going all in on the best generation of mainline games. Yes, the mobile
card is finally getting a big Gold and Silver push. Dibs on Lugia! Also
trading is finally getting fixed. Here’s when the Wisdom of Sea and Sky
expansion will be released in Pokémon […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-27, updated: 2025-07-25, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Ten years after Bloodborne‘s release, its fans are still exploring
the game and finding new secrets, while stubbornly waiting waiting for a
sequel. I also wish for more stories about old secrets and the dreams of
hunters. The hopes for a possible sequel only make me more eager to get
in touch with anything that […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-27, updated: 2025-07-25, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>If someone had told me that my most recent hyperfixation, the Netflix
phenomenon known as KPop Demon Hunters, would cross with my oldest, most
beloved wire mother known as Star Wars, I’d have been very skeptical.
After all, what could Cal Kestis, Bode Akuna, and Merrin from the Jedi
games possibly have in common with […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-27, updated: 2025-07-25, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>After becoming super, Mario seems to have pulled the ladder up behind
him. Our hometown blue-collar boy made it good in the Mushroom Kingdom’s
highest strata, ditching the plumber’s gig for a plush life as Princess
Peach’s royal favorite (whatever that may or may not entail). He and his
bro are set for life, so […]</p>

<p>The other day I was on my way to get drinks with some friends after
work, but in my head, I was still at work. I had just spent a 45-minute
subway ride with my nose buried in my Steam Deck playing Kaizen: A
Factory Story. Set in 1980s Japan, the inventive new project from

<p>Samantha Béart is obviously not a seven-foot-tall Barbarian in real
life, but the actor says they do share some personality traits with
one.  Béart is perhaps best known for their role as Karlach in Baldur’s
Gate 3 — the flammable, lovable Tiefling who became one of the
most-romanced characters in the game. The UK-based actor […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-27, updated: 2025-07-27, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Over the past 17 years, Marvel Studios has focused as much on the
continuity of its ongoing mega-story as it’s focused on the content of
any given superhero film. The 23-film Infinity Saga was never just about
individual movie narratives — it was about the buildup to Avengers:
Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, the two-part […]</p>

<p>San Diego Comic-Con is in full swing, and the latest Hall H panel
reveal goes to the upcoming Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba film, which
will begin selling tickets for North American theaters on Friday,
Aug. 15. Alongside the announcement, an exclusive visual for Demon
Slayer: Infinity Castle also debuted and can be seen below. […]</p>
