seeds in Grounded 2</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-29, updated: 2025-07-28, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Finding grass seeds in Grounded 2 is essential for getting the
Omni-Tool’s shovel attachment, which you’ll need for scooping up clay
and grubs, among many other things. The trouble is that Grounded 2
treats finding certain resources like an environmental puzzle and
assumes you’re going to look for the location in the right way without

<p>date: 2025-07-29, updated: 2025-07-28, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>I only played the original Grounded for a short spell in 2020, but I
remember it well. It was mere months into the COVID-19 pandemic and my
friends were desperate for new games to try as an excuse to socialize.
Thanks to its launch on Xbox Game Pass, we decided to get a group

<p>date: 2025-07-29, updated: 2025-07-29, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2’s new features include Joy-Cons that can become
a mouse. I’ve personally been wondering which game will allow us to take
full advantage of mouse controls, and now I know: Mario Paint. If you’ve
been looking for an excuse to get artsy, then this 33-year-old classic

<p>Roggenrola, the mantle Pokémon from Unova, can be found in the wild
in Pokémon Go. Yes, Roggenrola can be shiny in Pokémon Go! Roggenrola’s
shiny debuted during its very own Roggenrola Community Day in September
2022. Gigalith is a pretty decent rock-type attacker, but it has become
massively outclassed since its Community Day. You’re better […]</p>

<p>Seven months ago, Tencent, the world’s biggest gaming company,
revealed a new project: Light of Motiram, a futuristic open-world game
from studio Polaris Quest where machines rule the land. If that sounds
familiar, the actual trailer and its cybernetic animals only further
implied a specific inspirational source: Sony and Guerrilla Games’
Horizon series. Now Sony […]</p>

<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment is giving fans an early Evo gift with
a first look at the company’s first fight stick, the FlexStrike. The
arcade stick-like controller, previously known as Project Defiant, had
been attached to the upcoming 4v4 fighting game, Marvel Tōkon: Fighting
Souls, and was previously teased during Sony’s June 2025 State of Play.

<p>Genshin Impact version 5.8 is coming soon, adding the yearly

<p>In the wake of storefronts like Steam and itch.io curbing the sale of
adult games, irate fans have started an organized campaign against the
payment processors that they believe are responsible for the crackdown.
While the movement is still in its early stages, people are mobilizing

<p>On paper, a cozy little game set in the Shire sounds like a slam
dunk. The Shire is canonically a beautiful, peaceful, inviting little
place, and a game that lets you customize your own personal Hobbit hole
sounds delightful. But in practice, Weta Workshop’s new life sim, Tales

<p>The 2025 edition of San Diego Comic-Con was relatively muted: Marvel
skipped Hall H in favor of releasing The Fantastic Four: First Steps in
all its standalone-thrills-but-pivotal-end-credits-scene glory while
James Gunn only popped by to promote Peacemaker season 2, but nothing
more from his larger Warner Bros./DCU initiative. But the absence of two

<p>I’m not surprised smashing stuff in Donkey Kong Bananza is enjoyable.
