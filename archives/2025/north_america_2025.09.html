Donald Trump administration officials disbanded two expert committees on
economic data this week and suggested altering the way the U.S.
calculates gross domestic product. It’s not the first time the
administration has hinted at fiddling with important numbers, and a
listener wrote in to ask how all this might impact businesses and the
market. We’ll break it down. Plus, why is nobody talking about the debt
limit? And, congrats to Bill in Ohio on scoring a hat trick!

and the rise of women’s pro soccer</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-05, from: Market Place, Make me Smart</p>
<p>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
</p>
<p>
The National Women’s Soccer League’s regular season kicks off next week.
And thanks in part to a record-breaking
<a href="https://www.nwslsoccer.com/news/nwsl-announces-landmark-media-partnerships-with-cbs-sports-espn-prime-video-and-scripps-sports">media
rights agreement</a> and the growth of women’s professional sports
across the board, the league is gaining more attention — and investment
— than ever. Angel City Football Club became the highest-valued women’s
sports team in the world last year when Willow Bay and Bob Iger acquired
a controlling stake in the franchise for
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5642755/2024/07/17/angel-city-new-ownership-willow-bay-bob-iger/">$250
million.</a> Julie Uhrman, the team’s CEO and co-founder, says Angel
City is just the beginning. On the show today, Uhrman explains how she
and her co-founders got investors to see their vision, why a game day
experience that leaves you with FOMO is key to Angel City’s growth, and
how to watch the NWSL’s season.

much that might ease egg prices — a key driver of inflation — remains to
be seen. </p>
<p>“Donald Trump promised to lower food prices on ‘Day One,’ but with
egg prices skyrocketing out of control, he fired the workers charged
with containing bird flu. Working families need relief now,” Senator
Elizabeth Warren said in a statement. </p>
<p>What’s behind the record egg prices? </p>
<p>The industry blames bird flu, as do most experts. More than 166
million birds have been slaughtered to try to contain the virus. Some 30
million egg layers have been wiped out just since January, significantly
disrupting egg supplies. The Department of Agriculture’s long-standing
policy has been to kill entire flocks anytime the virus is found on a
farm. </p>
<p>As a result, the number of egg layers has dropped nationwide by about
12% from before the outbreak to 292 million birds, according to a Feb. 1
USDA estimate, but another 11 million egg layers have been killed since
then, so it’s likely worse. When prices spiked to $4.82 two years ago
and prompted initial calls for price gouging probes, the flock was above
300 million. </p>
<p>“This has nothing to do with anything other than bird flu. And I
think to suggest anything else is a misreading of the facts and the
reality,” American Egg Board President Emily Metz said. </p>
<p>“Our farmers are in the fight of their lives, period, full stop. And
they’re doing everything they can to keep these birds safe,” Metz said.
“This is a supply challenge. Due to bird flu. Nothing else.” </p>
<p>Farm Action suspects monopolistic behavior. The group that lobbies on
behalf of smaller farmers, consumers and rural communities notes that
egg production is down only about 4% from last year and 7.57 billion
table eggs were produced last month, yet some consumers are still
finding egg shelves empty at their local grocery stores. </p>
<p>“Dominant egg corporations are blaming avian flu for the price hikes
that we’re seeing. But while the egg supply has fallen only slightly,
these companies profits have soared,” said Angela Huffman, Farm Action’s
president. The Justice Department acknowledged receiving the group’s
letter calling for an investigation but declined to comment on it. </p>
<p>The fact that a jury ruled in 2023 that major egg producers used
various means to limit the domestic supply of eggs to increase the price
of products during the 2000s only adds to the doubts about their motives
now. </p>
<p>What do the numbers show? </p>
<p>Retail egg prices had generally remained below $2 per dozen for years
before this outbreak began. Prices have more than doubled since then,
boosting profits for egg producers even as they deal with soaring
costs. </p>
<p>Most of the dominant producers are privately held companies and don’t
release their results. But the biggest, Cal-Maine Foods, which supplies
about 20% of the nation’s eggs, is public, and its profits increased
dramatically. Cal-Maine reported a $219 million profit in the most
recent quarter when its eggs sold for an average of $2.74 per dozen, up
from just $1.2 million in the quarter just before this outbreak began in
early 2022 when its eggs were selling for $1.37 per dozen. </p>
<p>Sherman Miller, Cal-Maine’s president and CEO, said in reporting the
numbers that higher market prices “have continued to rise this fiscal
year as supply levels of shell eggs have been restricted due to recent
outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza.” </p>
<p>But he said Cal-Maine also sold significantly more eggs — 330 million
dozen, up from 288 million the year before — in the quarter because
demand is so strong and Cal-Maine has made a number of acquisitions.
Cal-Maine also suffered few outbreaks on its farms, outside of a couple
facilities in Kansas and Texas. The Mississippi-based company didn’t
respond to calls from The Associated Press. </p>
<p>What about production costs? </p>
<p>Economists and analysts say the record egg prices aren’t a sure sign
of something nefarious, and short-term profits might only last until
farms get hit. Once a flock is slaughtered, it can take as long as a
year to clean a farm and raise new birds to egg-laying age. The USDA
pays farmers for every bird killed, but it doesn’t cover all the costs
for farmers as they go without income. </p>
<p>“The consumer, I think, will probably feel like they’re getting the
rough end of the stick. But I guarantee you, the farmers that are having
to depopulate the barns, they’re having a rougher time,” CoBank analyst
Brian Earnest said. </p>
<p>Inflation in the costs of feed, fuel and labor have contributed to
rising egg prices, and farmers have been investing in biosecurity
measures to help keep the virus away. So production costs also appear to
be at an all-time high, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics’ producer price index. </p>
<p>“This isn’t a case where they’re taking the price up to gouge the
market. It is the price is going up through auction at wholesale. And
they’re benefiting from higher prices because supplies are tight,”
University of Arkansas agricultural economist Jada Thompson said.</p>

id="gene-hackman-likely-died-feb.-17-last-day-of-activity-on-pacemaker-official-says">Gene
Hackman likely died Feb. 17, last day of activity on pacemaker, official
says</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Academy Award-winning actor Gene Hackman likely died on Feb. 17, the
last day there was any activity on his pacemaker, Santa Fe County
Sheriff Adan Mendoza said Friday. “According to the pathologist,”
Mendoza said, “that is a very good assumption that was his last day of
life,” nine days before investigators found his body.</p>
<p>The bodies of Hackman, 95, and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, 64, a
classical pianist, were found, along with the dead body of one of their
three dogs, Wednesday in their home in the southwestern U.S. state of
New Mexico.</p>
<p>The initial findings of autopsies on the couple revealed that Hackman
and his wife both tested negative for carbon monoxide poisoning and “no
external trauma” was reported to either of them.  Mendoza said, “There
were no apparent signs of foul play.”</p>
<p>However, the couple’s “manner and cause of death has not been
determined,” according to the sheriff. “The official results of the
autopsy and toxicology reports are pending.”</p>
<p>Investigators have retrieved an assortment of prescription and
over-the-counter medications, in addition to cellphones and records from
medical diagnostics testing from the house.</p>
<p>“I’m pretty confident there is no foul play,” Mendoza said Friday on
The Today Show. He said the autopsy results “will steer us in the right
direction” in determining what happened to Hackman and his wife.</p>
<p>Without the autopsy, the sheriff said, it is difficult to determine
how long the couple had been dead.</p>
<p>A search warrant affidavit issued Thursday said the circumstances
surrounding the couple’s deaths were “suspicious enough in nature to
require a thorough search and investigation.”</p>
<p>Mendoza told The Today Show that several doors around the house were
unlocked and one door in the rear of the house was open. Earlier reports
said the front door was open.</p>
<p>Hackman’s body was found near the rear of the house, while his wife’s
body was found in a bathroom. The dead dog’s body was found in a dog
crate, not far from Arakawa’s body. The couple had three German
shepherds. The other two dogs were found alive and healthy at the
property.</p>
<p>The search warrant affidavit also revealed that police called the
Santa Fe Fire Department and the New Mexico Gas Company to Hackman’s
residence, but no toxic fumes or leaky pipes were found on the
grounds.</p>
<p>Storied career</p>
<p>Hackman had a lengthy career on stage and screen, including appearing
in Broadway shows, on television and in more than 80 films.</p>
<p>He won an Oscar for best actor for his role in the 1971 film The
French Connection and a best supporting Oscar for the 1992 film
Unforgiven.</p>
<p>Hackman’s resume featured three other Oscar nominations, including
his breakout role in Bonnie and Clyde in 1967 as well as I Never Sang
for My Father in 1970 and Mississippi Burning in 1988.</p>
<p>His work crossed genres as he appeared in action movies, thrillers
and off-beat comedies.</p>
<p>In addition to his award-nominated works, he was also known for roles
in films such as The Poseidon Adventure, Young Frankenstein, Superman,
Hoosiers, The Birdcage, and The Royal Tenenbaums.</p>
<p>His last film was Welcome to Mooseport in 2004.</p>
<p>His loss was immediately felt throughout the entertainment community
as fellow artists praised him on social media. Director Francis Ford
Coppola and actor Morgan Freeman were among those who posted their
remembrances of the actor.</p>
<p>“The loss of a great artist, always cause for both mourning and
celebration,” Coppola posted on Instagram. “Gene Hackman a great actor,
inspiring and magnificent in his work and complexity. I mourn his loss
and celebrate his existence and contribution.” Hackman starred in
Coppola’s 1974 film The Conversation.</p>
<p>Freeman posted on Instagram: “One of the personal highlights of my
career was bringing the French Film Gardé a Vue (Under Suspicion) to
life with the incredibly gifted Gene Hackman. And of course… Unforgiven.
Rest in peace, my friend.”</p>

Agence France-Presse and Reuters.</p>

id="illinois-jury-convicts-man-of-murdering-palestinian-american-boy">Illinois
jury convicts man of murdering Palestinian American boy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>An Illinois jury on Friday found a man guilty of murder and hate
crime charges for an October 2023 stabbing that killed a 6-year-old
Palestinian American boy and severely wounded his mother, according to
court documents.</p>
<p>Joseph Czuba, 73, faces life in prison when he is sentenced in May
for a murder that prosecutors said was sparked by anti-Muslim hatred. It
took place just days after Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist
organization, carried out an Oct. 7, 2023, attack inside Israel.</p>
<p>The murder of the boy, Wadee Alfayoumi, and the attack on his mother,
Hanan Shaheen, constituted one of the earliest and worst hate crime
incidents targeting Muslims in the U.S. after the Hamas attack on
Israel.</p>
<p>Rights advocates have noted rising Islamophobia and antisemitism in
the U.S. since that attack.</p>
<p>Czuba, who was the landlord for Shaheen and her son, stabbed the boy
26 times with a military-style knife with an 18-centimeter (7-inch)
serrated blade, authorities said. Shaheen suffered multiple stab wounds
in the attack, which occurred in Plainfield Township, about 64
kilometers (40 miles) southwest of Chicago.</p>
<p>During the trial this week, Shaheen testified that Czuba told her
“you, as a Muslim, must die,” according to local media reports.</p>
<p>Michael Fitzgerald, prosecutor at the Will County State’s Attorney’s
Office, presented a 911 call recording in the trial.</p>
<p>“The landlord is killing me and my baby,” Shaheen is heard saying on
the audio, according to CBS Chicago.</p>
<p>Other U.S. incidents raising alarm about anti-Arab bias include the
attempted drowning of a 3-year-old Palestinian American girl in Texas
and the stabbing of a Palestinian American man in Texas.</p>
<p>A few incidents raising alarm about antisemitism include threats of
violence against Jews at Cornell University that led to a conviction and
sentencing, and an unsuccessful plot to attack a New York Jewish
center.</p>

cases rise to 146 in outbreak that led to first US measles death in 10
years</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DALLAS, TEXAS — The number of people with measles in Texas increased
to 146 in an outbreak that led this week to the death of an unvaccinated
school-aged child, health officials said Friday. </p>
<p>The number of cases — Texas’ largest in nearly 30 years — increased
by 22 since Tuesday. The Texas Department of State Health Services said
cases span over nine counties in Texas and 20 patients have been
hospitalized. </p>
<p>The child who died Tuesday night in the outbreak is the first U.S.
death from the highly contagious but preventable respiratory disease
since 2015, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
said. </p>
<p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation’s top health official and a vaccine
critic, said Wednesday that the U.S. Department of the Health and Human
Services was watching cases but dismissed the outbreak as “not
unusual.” </p>
<p>But on Friday afternoon, Kennedy said in a post on X that his heart
went out to families impacted by the outbreak, and he recognized “the
serious impact of this outbreak on families, children, and healthcare
workers.” </p>
<p>Kennedy also said his agency will continue to fund Texas’
immunization program and that ending the outbreak is a “top priority”
for him and his team. </p>
<p>The virus has largely spread through rural, oil rig-dotted West
Texas, with cases concentrated in a “close-knit, undervaccinated”
Mennonite community, state health department spokesperson Lara Anton has
said. </p>
<p>Gaines County has a strong homeschooling and private school
community. It is also home to one of the highest rates of school-aged
children in Texas who have opted out of at least one required vaccine,
with nearly 14% skipping a required dose last school year. </p>
<p>Texas law allows children to get an exemption from school vaccines
for reasons of conscience, including religious beliefs. Anton has said
the number of unvaccinated kids in Gaines County is likely significantly
higher because homeschooled children’s data would not be reported. </p>
<p>The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is safe and highly
effective at preventing infection and severe cases. The first shot is
recommended for children ages 12 to 15 months, and the second for ages 4
to 6 years. Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead
to dangerous complications such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling
and death. </p>
<p>Vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19
pandemic, and most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for
kindergartners — the level needed to protect communities against measles
outbreaks. </p>
<p>The U.S. had considered measles eliminated in 2000, which meant there
had been a halt in continuous spread of the disease for at least a year.
Measles cases rose in 2024, including a Chicago outbreak that sickened
more than 60. </p>
<p>Eastern New Mexico has nine cases of measles, but the state health
department said there is no connection to the outbreak in West
Texas. </p>
<p>At a news conference Friday in Austin, officials urged people to get
vaccinated if they are not already. </p>
<p>“We’re here to say quite simply: Measles can kill, ignorance can kill
and vaccine denial definitely kills,” said U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a
Democrat.</p>

leaders stand by Ukraine after heated exchange between Trump,
Zelenskyy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>European leaders across much of the continent vowed to stand by
Ukraine after a White House meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump
and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy turned into a heated
exchange Friday, with Trump calling Zelenskyy “disrespectful.”</p>
<p>European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said it has become
clear that “the free world needs a new leader.”</p>
<p>“Ukraine is Europe! We stand by Ukraine,” Kallas wrote on the social
media platform X.</p>
<p>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on X, “Ukraine can rely on Germany
— and on Europe,” while Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez wrote on
social media, “Ukraine, Spain stands with you.”</p>
<p>“Dear <span class="citation"
data-cites="ZelenskyyUa">@ZelenskyyUa</span>, dear Ukrainian friends,
you are not alone,” wrote Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on X.</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters in Portugal, “Russia
is the aggressor, and Ukraine is the aggressed people.”</p>
<p>Other European leaders, including from Finland, the Netherlands, the
Czech Republic and Norway, also took to social media to voice support
for Ukraine.</p>
<p>Not all European leaders backed Ukraine. Hungarian Prime Minister
Viktor Orban, who has long been critical of EU military aid to Kyiv,
posted on X, “President <span class="citation"
data-cites="realDonaldTrump">@realDonaldTrump</span> stood bravely for
peace. Even if it was difficult for many to digest. Thank you,
Mr. President!”</p>
<p>The meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy came as the two countries
were seeking a deal that would allow the U.S. access to Ukrainian rare
mineral rights. The discussion took a combative tone about 40 minutes
into the meeting when Zelenskyy raised Russia’s 2014 invasion of
Crimea.</p>
<p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance immediately criticized Zelenskyy,
accusing him of engaging in a “propaganda tour.”</p>
<p>Both Vance and Trump accused the Ukrainian leader of not being
thankful for the assistance his country has received from
Washington.</p>
<p>After the meeting abruptly ended, the White House confirmed that the
mineral deal was not signed.</p>
<p>US response</p>
<p>In the U.S., many Republicans in Congress expressed support for
Trump’s actions.</p>
<p>Senator Lindsey Graham, who has previously supported military aid to
Ukraine, said, “What I saw in the Oval Office was disrespectful and I
don’t know if we can ever do business with Zelenskyy again.”</p>
<p>House Republican leader Steve Scalise, who has also previously
supported military aid to Ukraine, wrote on X, “President Trump is
fighting for PEACE around the world and is putting America First as our
best negotiator — he’s the only one to get Russia to the table to
consider a serious and lasting peace agreement with Ukraine.”</p>
<p>Republican Representative Andy Biggs wrote on X, “Dictator Zelensky
had the audacity to disrespect President <span class="citation"
data-cites="realDonaldTrump">@realDonaldTrump</span> and VP <span
class="citation" data-cites="JDVance">@JDVance</span> during what should
have been a friendly meeting, and <span class="citation"
data-cites="POTUS">@POTUS</span> rightfully showed him the door. This is
the leadership America has craved for four years.”</p>
<p>Democratic leaders in Congress argued that Trump’s actions would only
benefit Russia.</p>
<p>“Trump and Vance are doing [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s dirty
work. Senate Democrats will never stop fighting for freedom and
democracy,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said.</p>
<p>House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries wrote in a statement,
“Today’s White House meeting with the President of Ukraine was appalling
and will only serve to further embolden Vladimir Putin, a brutal
dictator. The United States must not reward Russian aggression and
continue to appease Putin.”</p>

id="iowa-removes-gender-identity-protections-from-states-civil-rights-code">Iowa
removes gender identity protections from state’s civil rights code</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DES MOINES, Iowa — Iowa became the first U.S. state to remove gender
identity protections from its civil rights code on Friday when Governor
Kim Reynolds signed into law a bill that opponents say will expose
transgender people and other Iowans to discrimination in all aspects of
daily life. </p>
<p>The new law, which goes into effect July 1, follows several years of
action from Reynolds and Iowa Republicans to restrict transgender
students’ use of such spaces as bathrooms and locker rooms, and their
participation on sports teams, in an effort to protect people assigned
female at birth. Republicans say those policies cannot co-exist with a
civil rights code that includes gender identity protections. </p>
<p>The law passed quickly after being introduced last week. It also
creates explicit legal definitions of female and male based on their
reproductive organs at birth, rejecting the idea that a person can
transition to another gender. Reynolds proposed a similar bill last
year, but it didn’t make it to a vote of the full House or Senate. </p>
<p>Reynolds posted a video on social media explaining her signature on
the bill and acknowledging that it was a “sensitive issue for
some.” </p>
<p>“It’s common sense to acknowledge the obvious biological differences
between men and women. In fact, it’s necessary to secure genuine equal
protection for women and girls,” she said, adding that the previous
civil rights code “blurred the biological line between the sexes.” </p>
<p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in
office to formalize a definition of the two sexes at the federal level,
leading several Republican-led legislatures to push for laws defining
male and female. Trump posted in support of the Iowa bill on his Truth
Social platform Thursday after it got final approval from the Iowa House
and Senate. </p>
<p>Five House Republicans joined all Democrats in the House and Senate
in voting against the bill. Iowa state Representative Aime Wichtendahl
was the final Democrat to speak before the vote, wiping away tears as
she offered her personal story as a transgender woman, saying: “I
transitioned to save my life.” </p>
<p>“The purpose of this bill and the purpose of every anti-trans bill is
to further erase us from public life and to stigmatize our existence,”
Wichtendahl said. “The sum total of every anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ bill
is to make our existence illegal.” </p>
<p>Hundreds of LGBTQ+ advocates streamed into the Capitol rotunda on
Thursday waving signs reading “Trans rights are human rights” and
chanting slogans including “No hate in our state!” There was a heavy
police presence, with state troopers stationed around the rotunda. The
few protesters who lingered for final passage of the bill were
emotional. </p>
<p>Not all states include gender identity in their civil rights codes,
but Iowa is now the first in the U.S. to remove nondiscrimination
protections based on gender identity, said Logan Casey, director of
policy research at the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ+ rights
think tank. </p>
<p>Sexual orientation and gender identity were not originally included
in the state’s Civil Rights Act of 1965. They were added by the
Democratic-controlled Legislature in 2007, with the support of about a
dozen Republicans across the two chambers. </p>
<p>The House Republican moving the bill Thursday, Representative Steven
Holt, said that if the Legislature can add protections, it can remove
them. </p>
<p>As of July 1, Iowa’s civil rights law will protect against
discrimination based on race, color, creed, sex, sexual orientation,
religion, national origin or disability status. </p>
<p>Iowa’s Supreme Court has expressly rejected the argument that
discrimination based on sex includes discrimination based on gender
identity. </p>
<p>Advocacy groups promise to defend transgender rights, which may lead
them to court. </p>
<p>Keenan Crow, director of policy and advocacy for LGBTQ+ advocacy
group One Iowa, said the organization is still analyzing the text of the
bill and that its vagueness makes it “hard to determine where the
enforcement is going to come from.” </p>
<p>“We will pursue any legal options available to us,” Crow said.</p>

tariff hike on vehicle imports could impact Nigeria’s auto market</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ABUJA, NIGERIA — For longtime automotive importer David Tope,
Nigeria’s auto market has become increasingly difficult. He used to
import up to five vehicles per week from the United States and Canada.
But since 2023, import costs have surged dramatically, driven by
currency depreciation and increased duties.</p>
<p>By early 2025, Tope paused his import business.</p>
<p>“It’s not just the country that’s the thing, but our inflation rate
is so high on duties and the naira devaluation — so it’s affecting
importing from any country at all,” said Tope. “It’s not just for the
car to be cheap, but also for our custom duties to be reconsidered so
that the normal man can at least survive this business of car
dealership.”</p>
<p>While Tope mulls his next move, the U.S. announced an impending 25%
tariff on vehicle imports, starting in April.</p>
<p>Though the policy targets cars entering the U.S., the decision could
impact Nigeria’s auto market, which depends on American used car
exports.</p>
<p>“U.S. is the main market of importation that we do, so if inflation
rate of 25% is being put on their cars, it’s going to affect Nigeria
market,” Tope said. “If the cars are being produced in U.S., it is going
to be cheaper for us. But if the cars are being imported to U.S, then
exported to us, the inflation rate will be unbearable for car dealers
like me.”</p>
<p>Importers aren’t the only ones affected. Vehicle prices in Nigeria
have jumped nearly 400% over the past two years, putting car ownership
out of reach for many consumers.</p>
<p>Nigerians such as Emmanuel Aaron and Akintunde Akinmolaye worry the
U.S. tariff will exacerbate price woes.</p>
<p>“Honestly, the cost has gone so, so high that my interest in buying
cars has to be suspended,” Aaron said.</p>
<p>“We know that U.S. cars are built with quality, care and comfort
compared to other places,” said Akinmolaye, “but in terms of cost now,
cost may make one jettison all those preferences.”</p>
<p>Economist Hauwa Mustapha believes a 25% U.S. tariff could reshape
Nigeria’s auto market. If the U.S. prioritizes local vehicle production,
fewer used cars could be available for export, pushing up prices in
Nigeria.</p>
<p>Beyond affordability, she said the import business itself is at risk.
Thousands of Nigerians depend on vehicle imports for their livelihoods —
from importers to mechanics, parts dealers and transport workers.</p>
<p>Currently, Nigeria produces about 14,000 vehicles annually, a small
fraction of what its market demands. Experts say strengthening local
manufacturing is the only long-term solution.</p>
<p>Mustapha said more needs to be done to revive and strengthen the
country’s steel industry.</p>
<p>Shoring up Nigeria’s supportive infrastructure, she said, “will
enable more production of some of these already locally assembled
vehicles.”</p>
<p>For now, Nigerian importers like Tope are in wait-and-see mode.</p>

id="un-chief-urges-us-to-reverse-severe-aid-cuts-to-humanitarian-programs">UN
chief urges US to reverse ‘severe’ aid cuts to humanitarian
programs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Friday that
Washington has notified many U.N. agencies and humanitarian and
development organizations this week of “severe” funding cuts, which he
said will be “devastating” for the world’s most vulnerable people, and
he urged the Trump administration to reconsider them.</p>
<p>“Going through with these cuts will make the world less healthy, less
safe and less prosperous,” Guterres told reporters at the United
Nations. “The reduction of America’s humanitarian role and influence
will run counter to American interests globally.”</p>
<p>He urged the United States, as well as other countries that have
recently announced reductions in humanitarian and development aid, to
reverse their decisions after more careful reviews of the programs.</p>
<p>“In the meantime, every United Nations agency stands ready to provide
the necessary information and justification for its projects,” Guterres
added. “And we look forward to working with the United States in this
regard.”</p>
<p>The U.N. chief did not give a dollar figure of how much the U.N. and
its agencies will lose and would not take reporters’ questions. But the
United States is the largest single donor in terms of humanitarian
funding to the United Nations humanitarian appeal. In 2024, it provided
$14 billion, just over 40% of the total contributions. By contrast,
Germany, the second-largest contributor, provided $2.7 billion, or about
8% of global funding.</p>
<p>The Trump administration, through its Department of Government
Efficiency, or DOGE, has slashed $60 billion in overseas assistance as
part of its effort to massively cut government costs. That included
shuttering the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and
reversing decades of U.S. foreign policy that viewed the soft power of
humanitarian aid as being in America’s national interest.</p>
<p>That has left scores of international aid agencies scrambling to try
to keep their programs going. The secretary-general said U.N. staff in
the field are also taking urgent steps to protect as much of their
lifesaving work as possible.</p>
<p>Guterres gave some examples of where U.S. cuts would affect — or
already have affected — provision of critical services.</p>
<p>“In Afghanistan, more than 9 million people will miss out on health
and protection services, with hundreds of mobile health teams and other
services suspended,” he said.</p>
<p>In South Sudan, he said, funding has run out for programs to support
people who have fled the war in neighboring Sudan. And in Ukraine,
cash-based humanitarian assistance has been suspended in key
regions.</p>
<p>“Our absolute priority remains clear,” Guterres said. “We will do
everything we can to provide lifesaving aid to those in urgent need. And
we will continue our efforts to diversify the pool of generous donors
who support our work.”</p>
<p>Questioned later by reporters, Guterres’ spokesperson said the
agencies had been informed by letter of the cuts, most coming from
USAID’s acting deputy administrator, Peter Marocco. Spokesperson
Stephane Dujarric said that U.N. officials “at a fairly senior level”
had tried to talk with U.S. officials about the cuts.</p>
<p>“But I can’t say we’ve detected much interest in engaging on this
issue,” he said.</p>
<p>Dujarric listed some of the agencies that have received termination
letters, including the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which
received 27 letters; the International Office for Migration (IOM), which
had 22 of 25 USAID programs terminated; and the U.N. Office on Drugs and
Crime (UNODC), which had about 50 projects terminated.</p>
<p>“Their office in Mexico, which deals among other things with the flow
of fentanyl, may have to close,” Dujarric said of UNODC. “It will impact
their programs in Central America and the Darien Gap focusing on
fighting human trafficking.”</p>
<p>UNAIDS, which provides lifesaving HIV treatment around the world,
said Friday that it received a letter from Washington on Thursday
terminating its agreement with UNAIDS “with immediate effect.”</p>
<p>This follows the decision in late January by Secretary of State Marco
Rubio to continue funding UNAIDS while the U.S. foreign assistance
review was ongoing and other international assistance was paused.</p>
<p>“This is a serious development which impacts the entire HIV response,
including in the continuity of lifesaving HIV services for people living
with and affected by HIV, civil society and our partners,” UNAIDS said
in a statement.</p>
<p>Since 2003, through its PEPFAR program, the United States has helped
save more than 26 million lives by investing in critical HIV prevention,
treatment, care and support programs in 55 countries.</p>
<p>Rubio has said that going forward, all foreign aid must make America
safer, stronger and more prosperous.</p>
<p>A State Department spokesperson said Thursday that so far more than
9,100 foreign assistance-related grants worth over $15.9 billion have
been reviewed. More than 4,100 grants worth nearly $4.4 billion have
been identified for elimination as part of “the America First agenda” —
a 28% reduction in total grant value.</p>
<p>“USAID evaluated 6,200 multiyear awards with $58.2 billion in value
remaining,” the spokesperson added. “At the conclusion of a process led
by USAID leadership, including tranches personally reviewed by Secretary
Rubio, nearly 5,800 awards with $54 billion in value remaining were
identified for elimination as part of the America First agenda — a 92%
reduction.”</p>

<h2 id="white-house-media-access-stirs-debate">White House media access
stirs debate</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Who gets access to cover the White House and what their
role is have been the subject of debate over the past few weeks.</p>
<p>The two main issues are a lawsuit filed by The Associated Press to
contest the White House’s restrictions on its reporters, and the White
House’s announcement that it is taking control of the pool system that
provides close-up coverage of the president.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown on the cases.</p>
<p>White House to pick press pool</p>
<p>In a departure from decadeslong precedent, White House press
secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Tuesday that the White House
will decide which reporters make up the press pool.</p>
<p>“Legacy outlets who have participated in the press pool for decades
will still be allowed to join — fear not,” Leavitt said during a press
briefing. “We will also be offering the privilege to well-deserving
outlets who have never been allowed to share in this awesome
responsibility.”</p>
<p>The press pool is a rotating group of journalists from print, TV and
radio who cover the president up close each day for the broader press
corps. VOA is among the outlets that provides pool coverage.</p>
<p>The White House Correspondents’ Association, or WHCA, has coordinated
the press pool since the 1950s. The association’s nearly 800 members
represent nearly 300 news organizations. Not all members of the
association are part of the presidential pool – only those that can
devote the time and resources needed to accompany the president on
trips.</p>
<p>The WHCA described the decision to change the system as an affront to
press freedom.</p>
<p>“This move tears at the independence of a free press in the United
States,” WHCA president Eugene Daniels said in a statement. “In a free
country, leaders must not be able to choose their own press corps.”</p>
<p>Some media outlets that are part of the pool and rely on its coverage
have said the change could hamper the spread of reliable
information.</p>
<p>AP restrictions</p>
<p>A judge this week described the White House’s ban on The AP as
“problematic” but declined to immediately order the White House to
restore the news agency’s access.</p>
<p>The nonprofit news agency has been blocked from some White House
events, as well as the Oval Office and Air Force One, over its editorial
decision to retain the “Gulf of Mexico” name to refer to the body of
water that Trump renamed the Gulf of America via an executive order.</p>
<p>After Trump issued his “Gulf of America” executive order, the news
agency said it would continue referring to the body of water as the Gulf
of Mexico while acknowledging the name Trump had picked in an effort to
avoid confusing its international audiences.</p>
<p>Many news outlets have followed The AP’s lead, but others, including
VOA, Fox and Axios, have changed their style to reflect the executive
order. VOA, like many other media outlets, also subscribes to The AP’s
news and video services.</p>
<p>Jane Kirtley, a media ethics and law professor at the University of
Minnesota, said it could be considered unethical for news outlets to
comply with such orders from a president.</p>
<p>“I think there is an argument that the ethical thing to do for a news
organization is to resist that,” Kirtley told VOA. “In order to maintain
their independence, they sometimes need to fight back against
overreaching by the government.”</p>
<p>In a lawsuit filed Feb. 21, The AP said the ban violates its First
Amendment free speech rights and its Fifth Amendment procedural rights,
because it had no chance to appeal the decision internally.</p>
<p>Trump has stood by the ban, saying, “We’re gonna keep them [The AP]
out until such time as they agree that it’s the Gulf of America.”</p>
<p>At the Monday court hearing, U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden said
The AP had not yet demonstrated that it had suffered irreparable
harm.</p>
<p>The White House celebrated McFadden’s ruling. “As we have said from
the beginning, asking the president of the United States questions in
the Oval Office and aboard Air Force One is a privilege granted to
journalists, not a legal right,” it said in a statement.</p>
<p>Still, McFadden said the White House’s restriction on AP was
problematic. “It seems pretty clearly viewpoint discrimination,” he
said.</p>
<p>Viewpoint discrimination is when the government retaliates against
individuals or news outlets over specific viewpoints. The Supreme Court
has repeatedly ruled that such discrimination constitutes a First
Amendment violation because it prevents a level playing field for all
opinions.</p>
<p>After the Monday hearing, AP spokesperson Lauren Easton said in a
statement that the news agency looked forward to the next hearing “where
we will continue to stand for the right of the press and the public to
speak freely without government retaliation.”</p>
<p>In its statement after the Monday hearing, the White House said, “We
stand by our decision to hold the Fake News accountable for their
lies.”</p>
<p>The next hearing in The AP’s lawsuit is set for March 20.</p>

<h2 id="chinas-backdoor-to-us-markets-may-be-closing-soon">China’s
backdoor to US markets may be closing soon</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — President Donald Trump’s 25% tariff on imports from
Mexico and Canada, scheduled to kick in Tuesday, will affect not only
those two countries but also will have direct implications on Chinese
companies. </p>
<p>The Hofusan Industrial Park is a complex about 20 km north of
Monterrey, Mexico, and a 2.5-hour drive to the U.S. border city of
Laredo, Texas. The industrial park, set up specifically for Chinese
companies, describes itself as “an ideal logistics hub for the North
American market” on its website.  </p>
<p>The site also promotes itself as “an alternative” to exporting
Chinese products to America” and lists “to avoid trade barriers” as
reasons for Chinese capital to be invested in the Mexico-based
industrial park.</p>
<p>At a Thursday news conference, Trump repeated his reasons for
imposing 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada and an additional 10% tariff
on imports from China, which also goes into effect Tuesday.</p>
<p>“The drugs come in through Mexico. A lot of them, not all, but a lot
come from China, and that’s why we did that,” Trump said.</p>
<p>The tariffs are not aimed solely at drugs, according to Evan Ellis,
research professor of Latin American studies and a China expert at the
U.S. Army War College.</p>
<p>He told VOA that Trump “also is sending the message that his
administration will not allow Chinese companies to use Mexico as a
pass-through, for tariff-free access to the U.S. market, by reinventing
themselves as Mexican companies, however attractive such investment may
be in the short term to Mexico.”</p>
<p>The 25% tariff on Mexican imports will “significantly” affect these
Chinese businesses, said Christopher Tang, business and supply chain
professor at the University of California-Los Angeles. </p>
<p>“These tariffs can erode their competitive advantage and profit
margins. The tariffs effectively close the U.S. market door for these
companies unless they find alternative strategies to mitigate the
impact,” Tang said.  </p>
<p>Chinese companies that operate within the Hofusan Industrial Park did
not respond to VOA’s requests for comment. </p>
<p>Tang expects Chinese companies in Mexico to either refocus on Latin
American markets, if they stay in Mexico, or move their operations to
the U.S. or Asia to avoid the steep tariff. </p>
<p>Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for
International Economics in Washington, said, “Chinese companies located
in Canada or Mexico will obviously be targets of the United States.
Therefore, I think Chinese companies need to look for other locations,
and possible destinations include Australia, Japan, Nordic countries,
the United Kingdom, Brazil.”</p>
<p>Mexico: cost-effective alternative </p>
<p>Tariffs imposed during Trump’s first term, maintained and expanded
during Joe Biden’s presidency, plus higher transportation costs in
recent years, prompted many Chinese companies to look for an alternate,
more cost-effective way of entering the U.S. market.  </p>
<p>Mexico became their first choice for building factories, and the
Hofusan Industrial Park tailored for Chinese enterprises broke ground in
2017.  </p>
<p>Some companies import products or components from China to produce in
Mexico and export to the United States.  </p>
<p>Others have been manufacturing and assembling their products in
Mexico, putting on the “Made in Mexico” label, and sending the products
to the United States with no tariff. </p>
<p>Currently there are about 40 companies in the industrial park,
including engineering equipment manufacturer Lingong Heavy Machinery,
electric car manufacturer BYD, home appliance manufacturer Hisense,
solar panel manufacturer Trina Solar and Man Wah Furniture. </p>
<p>The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), implemented in
July 2020, allows Mexican-made products that meet certain rules of
origin to enter the U.S. tariff free.  </p>
<p>The agreement is up for review and renewal in July 2026. If it is not
renewed or if there are even more tariffs imposed on Mexican imports,
“the incentives for Chinese investment going to Mexico will largely go
away, and thus Mexico will not reap the continued benefits of the
current rush by Chinese companies to invest in Mexico to take advantage
of nearshoring anyway,” said Ellis. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Chinese reshoring </p>
<p>Xeneta, an Oslo-based company that analyzes air and ocean freight
markets, said in a study last year that China’s trade with Mexico was
“the fastest growing trade route on the planet.”</p>
<p>Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) in Mexico has also increased
significantly over the past five years. The automotive industry has long
been a major driver of Chinese direct investment in Mexico, accounting
for about a third of Mexican investment since the mid-2010s. But in the
past few years, it has become the main driver of investment. </p>
<p>According to an analysis by the research firm Rhodium Group, in 2023,
Chinese companies invested $2.72 billion in the automotive sector,
accounting for 72% of China’s investment in Mexico that year. This trend
continued until the first half of 2024, with automotive industry
investment accounting for three-quarters of China’s total investment in
Mexico. </p>
<p>Backdoor concern </p>
<p>Mexico’s rapidly growing trade relationship with China has aroused
concerns in the United States that Chinese companies are using the
“backdoor” of USMCA to continue to import goods into the U.S. </p>
<p>Nick Vyas, a global supply chain expert at the University of Southern
California’s Marshall School of Business, told VOA that Chinese
companies setting up factories in Mexico have become a pressing issue in
bilateral trade negotiations between the United States and Mexico. </p>
<p>“Chinese direct or indirect investment in Mexico has now become a
question,” he said. “When we say ‘Made in Mexico,’ is it really made in
Mexico or is it assembled in Mexico?” </p>
<p>“Traceability and trade compliance will be the focus of the next
generation of trade issues,” said Vyas, who believes that Mexican
President Claudia Sheinbaum is likely to sacrifice the interests of
these Chinese companies if necessary. </p>
<p>Ellis said, “It is likely that there will be an escalation in the
trade war that will further damage the already fragile PRC [People’s
Republic of China] economy and Chinese companies, if the PRC government
responds with tariffs of its own.” </p>
<p>But a trade war is also worrying U.S. businesses and consumers, said
Tang. </p>
<p>“Cost goes up, price goes up, and availability/choices will go down,”
he said. “[The] U.S. needs time to rebuild its industrial ecosystem that
has been hollowed out since the 1980s. Pushing so many tariffs all at
once without securing the production capabilities and capacity is very
risky.”</p>
