<p>
The National Women’s Soccer League’s regular season kicks off next week.
And thanks in part to a record-breaking
<a href="https://www.nwslsoccer.com/news/nwsl-announces-landmark-media-partnerships-with-cbs-sports-espn-prime-video-and-scripps-sports">media
rights agreement</a> and the growth of women’s professional sports
across the board, the league is gaining more attention — and investment
— than ever. Angel City Football Club became the highest-valued women’s
sports team in the world last year when Willow Bay and Bob Iger acquired
a controlling stake in the franchise for
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5642755/2024/07/17/angel-city-new-ownership-willow-bay-bob-iger/">$250
million.</a> Julie Uhrman, the team’s CEO and co-founder, says Angel
City is just the beginning. On the show today, Uhrman explains how she
and her co-founders got investors to see their vision, why a game day
experience that leaves you with FOMO is key to Angel City’s growth, and
how to watch the NWSL’s season.

Today, we’re talking about one of Kai’s favorite topics: bonds! The
yield on the 10-year Treasury note (the benchmark for mortgages and car
loans) is down sharply, which is great for consumers. But it’s happening
for not necessarily great reasons. We’ll explain. Plus, why Kimberly is
keeping a close eye on one of her go-to government websites. And, she’ll
