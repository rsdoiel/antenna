Mesoscale Discussion 0528
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0239 PM CDT Wed Apr 23 2025

Areas affected...parts of wrn KS...sern CO...OK Pnhdl

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 231939Z - 232215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Intensifying thunderstorm development appears increasingly
probable through the 4-6 PM CDT time frame, including the potential
for supercells posing a risk for large hail and tornadoes in a
focused area near/southeast of Goodland.

DISCUSSION...With daytime heating and mixing, the boundary-layer
within surface troughing across the Texas/Oklahoma Panhandle
vicinity through western Kansas continues to deepen and destabilize.
It now appears generally characterized by surface temperature/dew
point spreads in excess of 30 F, with CAPE increasing to 1500-2000+
J/kg.

Inhibition is in the process of weakening, and deepening high-based
convection is now evident within the axis of stronger
destabilization.  With further insolation, the initiation of
thunderstorms appears increasingly probable, some of which may
eventually be accompanied by small hail and localized strong
downbursts.

Of greater concern is the potential for convective development where
better low-level moisture, on the western periphery of outflow
associated with persistent ongoing convection across central Kansas,
intersects the axis of stronger heating.  This appears focused near
a weak developing cyclonic circulation southeast of Goodland, where
shear associated with clockwise turning of low-level wind fields
with height, beneath a belt of 30 kt westerly flow around 500 mb, is
likely sufficient for supercells.  This is where potential for large
hail appears maximized, and near-surface CAPE/upward vertical
accelerations may promote the potential for tornadoes.

Areas affected...far southwestern Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 231914Z - 232115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Risk for gusty winds and large hail possible this
afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Deepening cumulus is observed across the Davis
Mountains and ahead of the surface dryline across far western Texas.
Temperatures have warmed into the upper 70s to 80s which has led to
weakening of MLCIN across the region. Convective initiation should
occur in the next 1-2 hours. Ahead of the dryline, MLCAPE around
1000-2000 J/kg  with deep layer shear around 35-40 kts. This will
support supercells capable of large hail (some very large) and
damaging winds, given steep lapse rates around 8-9 C/km. A watch may
be needed in the coming hour.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0254 PM CDT Wed Apr 23 2025

Valid 232000Z - 241200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE SOUTHERN/CENTRAL PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe thunderstorms are forecast over parts of
the southern/central Plains today and tonight, with large hail and
damaging winds possible.

...20z Update...
The previous forecast generally remains on track with only minor
adjustments needed. A slight westward expansion of 5% hail/wind
probabilities across southeast CO where convective initiation is
underway along the Raton Mesa upstream of a moist/unstable
environment. A significant hail area has also been introduced for
portions of western KS where backed low-level flow within a
moderately unstable environment (MLCAPE around 2000 J/kg) should
promote robust supercells with an attendant large/very large hail
threat. Consideration was given to introducing significant hail/wind
areas across parts of southwest TX; however, recent ACARS and RAP
forecast soundings show somewhat weaker mid-level winds (15-20
knots) compared to yesterday when significant hail/wind occurred in
a similar thermodynamic environment. This, combined with the
potential for more limited convective coverage, limits confidence in
a sufficiently widespread significant hail/wind threat to warrant
additional probabilities. See the previous discussion and recently
issued MCDs #527 and #528 for additional details.

..Moore.. 04/23/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1128 AM CDT Wed Apr 23 2025/

...Central and Southern High Plains...
Modest zonal flow pattern persists across the Plains states today,
with only weak large scale forcing anticipated.  However, strong
heating across the High Plains, coupled with circulations along a
diffuse dryline and forcing associated with the nocturnal low-level
jet will aid in the development of scattered thunderstorms from
western KS into the TX Panhandle this afternoon and evening.

The area of greatest concentration of storms will likely be over
western KS, where model guidance shows greatest confidence in a
strengthening low-level jet and some upper support.  Storms should
develop by late afternoon, with forecast soundings showing
sufficient deep-layer shear for supercell structures.  Large hail
will be the main concern.  Low-level moisture will be marginal, but
enlarging hodographs by early evening could also support a risk of a
few tornadoes.

Farther south, thunderstorm coverage will be more widely scattered
across the TX Panhandle into the Big Bend region.  Nevertheless,
steep mid-level lapse rates and sufficient westerly flow aloft will
pose a risk of a few supercells capable of large hail and damaging
winds through the evening.

...Northeast KS...
A small cluster of strong storms has developed this morning over
central KS.  Several morning CAM solutions suggest an increasing
risk of thunderstorm development/intensification by mid-afternoon
over northeast KS - in vicinity of a weak surface boundary.  While
this scenario is unclear, a few of these storms could pose a risk of
large hail and gusty/damaging winds.

...Southeast States...
Strong daytime heating will aid in destabilization across much of
GA/SC this afternoon, with scattered thunderstorm development
expected.  Winds aloft are weak and storms should be relatively
disorganized.  However, cool temperatures aloft will aid in a few
robust updrafts - posing some risk of hail and gusty winds.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0235 PM CDT Wed Apr 23 2025

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...20z Update...
Minimal changes have been made to the prior outlook. Dry conditions
are likely across parts of the Southwest and northeastern NM behind
a sharpening lee trough/dryline. However, consensus model guidance
suggests winds are unlikely to gust over 15-20 mph on a widespread
basis. Additional elevated conditions are possible over parts of
western FL where very warm temperatures and low RH will support some
fire-weather risk. See the previous discussion.

..Lyons.. 04/23/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0158 AM CDT Wed Apr 23 2025/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will impinge on the California coastline while
generally upper-ridging builds over the central and eastern CONUS
tomorrow (Thursday). Dry and occasionally breezy conditions are
possible across parts of the Desert Southwest. However, the latest
guidance consensus suggests that the surface wind field across
Arizona into New Mexico will be too weak to warrant Elevated
highlights at this time. Otherwise, another day of dry southeasterly
winds will encourage Elevated wildfire-spread potential across
western portions of the Florida Peninsula.

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF THE OKLAHOMA AND WESTERN TEXAS AREA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible across parts of Oklahoma
and northwest Texas Friday afternoon and evening.

...Synopsis...
An upper trough sweeping across Hudson Bay/Ontario/the Upper Great
Lakes region Friday will drive deepening of a surface low initially
over the southern Wisconsin vicinity.  As it deepens, the low is
forecast to shift east-northeastward across the Upper Great Lakes
through the Day, and then across southern Ontario and into Quebec
overnight.  As this occurs, a surface cold front will shift
southeastward across the Ohio Valley region, and more slowly
southward across Oklahoma and the Ozarks region.  

Meanwhile in the West, an upper low over the eastern Pacific is
forecast to deepen and shift southeastward toward the vicinity of
the central California Coast overnight.  As this occurs, downstream
ridging will evolve/amplify across the central U.S. through the
period.

...Southern Plains...
Convection appears likely to be ongoing at the start of the period
across the Oklahoma vicinity, in the vicinity of the sagging cold
front.  Despite increased ridging aloft, rather weak warm-sector
capping will likely support at least isolated storm redevelopment,
both near the front as it shifts southward across Oklahoma and the
Texas Panhandle/South Plains through the day, and near any remnant
outflows from earlier/potentially ongoing convection.  The
combination of moderate instability and somewhat modest shear
suggests only isolated severe risk -- mainly in the form of hail and
locally gusty/damaging winds.  Low-level jet development expected
during the evening over the High Plains may help sustain convection
through the overnight hours.

...Elsewhere...
Scattered thunderstorms -- and perhaps a couple of stronger storms
capable of producing gusty winds and small hail -- are expected
across parts of the Great Lakes/Midwest/Mid South region, near and
ahead of the aforementioned/advancing cold front.  Modest CAPE is
expected across the area, and with rather weak shear as well, any
severe risk would likely remain quite limited/local.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM EASTERN
COLORADO EASTWARD ACROSS MUCH OF KANSAS...AND SOUTHWARD ACROSS
OKLAHOMA AND NORTHERN/WESTERN TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible on Thursday from eastern
Colorado into Kansas, and southward across west Texas and Oklahoma. 
Large hail and locally strong wind gusts will be possible with this
activity.

...Synopsis...
A broad zone of modest west-southwesterly flow aloft will prevail
across most of the country again on Thursday, though faster flow is
progged over New England in conjunction with a short-wave trough
moving eastward across southern Quebec and -- eventually -- northern
New England.  A second trough, off the West Coast, is expected to
pivot eastward toward the central and southern California coast
through the second half of the period.

At the surface, frontal wave development is forecast along a
baroclinic zone extending from southwestern Kansas into the Upper
Midwest, as a mid-level short-wave trough moves through the
background west-southwesterlies.  By evening, a weak low is forecast
over the Iowa vicinity, with some southward progression of the
trailing front across Kansas.  Meanwhile, a dryline is forecast to
mix eastward during the afternoon across the Texas Panhandle and
South Plains areas, while remaining more stationary but sharpening
across the Davis Mountains area.  The aforementioned front, and the
dryline, should both focus diurnal increases in thunderstorm
activity.

...Eastern Colorado and Kansas south across Oklahoma and
northern/western Texas...
Thunderstorms are forecast to be ongoing at the start of the period
across portions of the MRGL risk area, including western Kansas and
potentially portions of the Concho Valley area of Texas.  The Texas
convection is forecast to weaken with time, though the Kansas storms
-- occurring in the vicinity of the surface baroclinic zone -- may
persist through the day.

By afternoon, as heating of the moist warm sector contributes to
moderate destabilization, additional storm
development/intensification is forecast across southern Kansas, and
southward along the dryline mixing across western Texas.  While
deep-layer flow across the region is forecast to remain somewhat
weak/sub-optimal in terms of more robust severe potential, veering
winds with height should contribute to ample shear for mid-level
rotation with developing storms.  Large hail and locally damaging
winds can be expected with the strongest cells.

Though tornado risk will remain limited overall, slightly greater
potential may evolve across the southwestern Kansas/northwestern
Oklahoma area, and adjacent, eastern portions of the Texas/Oklahoma
Panhandles.  Here, near a weak low at the intersection of the
surface front and the dryline, backed low-level flow and slightly
stronger mid-level west-southwesterlies may support potential for a
tornado during the afternoon/early evening.

Storms across this area may congeal/grow upscale during the evening,
spreading eastward across the Oklahoma/North Texas area as a
low-level jet nocturnally increases.  Attendant, local risk for
hail/wind may persist through the evening.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1133 AM CDT Wed Apr 23 2025

Valid 231700Z - 241200Z

...1630Z update...

Current and expected surface observations across the Florida
Peninsula suggest a more limited fire weather threat across the area
today. Fuels remain very dry with relative humidity expected to drop
into the 30-40 percent range this afternoon across the western
Florida Peninsula. However, stronger east-southeast winds associated
with the Atlantic sea breeze will coincide with a fairly rapid rise
in relative humidity with limited overlap of dry and breezy
conditions across western Florida. Therefore, Elevated highlights
were removed for this afternoon. 

Dry and breezy conditions remain across portions of the Southwest
with Elevated highlights remaining in place, although lighter than
expected winds prompted some trimming of Elevated highlights across
the Trans Pecos area.

..Williams/Lyons.. 04/23/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0153 AM CDT Wed Apr 23 2025/

...Synopsis...
A broad but weak cyclonic upper flow regime will overspread the
western CONUS as zonal flow aloft becomes established over the
Northern Plains to the Northeast today. An embedded mid-level
impulse will pivot around the cyclonic flow and track over the
southern High Plains by afternoon, with dry downslope flow
developing across southeast Arizona into Far West Texas as a
low-level mass response. 15 mph sustained southwesterly surface
winds amid 10-15 percent RH will promote conditions favorable for
wildfire-spread, with Elevated highlights introduced where fuels are
dry/unaffected by recent rainfall.

Meanwhile, dry and breezy conditions are likely across western parts
of the Florida Peninsula by afternoon peak heating. 10-15 mph
sustained southeasterly winds will coincide with 30-40 percent RH
atop dry fuels, warranting Elevated highlights.

1128 AM CDT Wed Apr 23 2025

Valid 231630Z - 241200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE SOUTHERN/CENTRAL PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe thunderstorms are forecast over parts of
the southern/central Plains today and tonight, with large hail and
damaging winds possible.

...Central and Southern High Plains...
Modest zonal flow pattern persists across the Plains states today,
with only weak large scale forcing anticipated.  However, strong
heating across the High Plains, coupled with circulations along a
diffuse dryline and forcing associated with the nocturnal low-level
jet will aid in the development of scattered thunderstorms from
western KS into the TX Panhandle this afternoon and evening.

The area of greatest concentration of storms will likely be over
western KS, where model guidance shows greatest confidence in a
strengthening low-level jet and some upper support.  Storms should
develop by late afternoon, with forecast soundings showing
sufficient deep-layer shear for supercell structures.  Large hail
will be the main concern.  Low-level moisture will be marginal, but
enlarging hodographs by early evening could also support a risk of a
few tornadoes.

Farther south, thunderstorm coverage will be more widely scattered
across the TX Panhandle into the Big Bend region.  Nevertheless,
steep mid-level lapse rates and sufficient westerly flow aloft will
pose a risk of a few supercells capable of large hail and damaging
winds through the evening.

...Northeast KS...
A small cluster of strong storms has developed this morning over
central KS.  Several morning CAM solutions suggest an increasing
risk of thunderstorm development/intensification by mid-afternoon
over northeast KS - in vicinity of a weak surface boundary.  While
this scenario is unclear, a few of these storms could pose a risk of
large hail and gusty/damaging winds.

...Southeast States...
Strong daytime heating will aid in destabilization across much of
GA/SC this afternoon, with scattered thunderstorm development
expected.  Winds aloft are weak and storms should be relatively
disorganized.  However, cool temperatures aloft will aid in a few
robust updrafts - posing some risk of hail and gusty winds.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE SOUTHERN/CENTRAL PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe thunderstorms are forecast over parts of
the southern/central Plains today and tonight, with large hail and
damaging winds possible.

...Southern/Central Plains...
Convective clusters have persisted through the early morning hours
across parts of TX, aided by modest low-level warm/moist advection.
This activity has generally weakened, but it could still pose some
threat for mainly isolated gusty winds towards the ArkLaTex and
Upper TX Coast. In its wake, a convectively overturned airmass will
exist today over much of central TX, while modified low-level
moisture will once again advect west-northwestward over the
southern/central High Plains. A similar convective scenario to
yesterday remains apparent, with generally modest west-southwesterly
mid-level flow present over much of the southern/central Plains.
Multiple low-amplitude perturbations should advance
east-northeastward in this regime across the central CONUS through
the period. At the surface, a front draped southwest to northeast
over the central Plains and a dryline extending southward over the
southern Plains should both serve as foci for convective initiation
later today.

Steep mid-level lapse rates are once again expected to be in place
across the warm sector. Diurnal heating of a modestly moist
low-level airmass in combination with these steep lapse rates should
aid in the development of moderate to locally strong instability by
mid afternoon. Weak low-level winds veering and gradually
strengthening with height through mid/upper levels will foster
around 25-35 kt of effective bulk shear, which should be adequate
for modest convective organization. Current expectations are for
isolated to scattered thunderstorms to once again develop along both
the front and dryline by mid to late afternoon. A mix of multicells
and slow-moving supercells is anticipated, with associated threats
for both severe/damaging winds and large hail. 

The Slight Risk has been expanded northeastward across KS and into
far southern NE based on latest guidance trends showing greater
coverage of potentially intense thunderstorms this afternoon/evening
along and near the front. The potential for thunderstorms to grow
upscale into one or more clusters this evening remains uncertain
owing to weak large-scale forcing for ascent. Even so, a
strengthening low-level jet overnight may aid in convective
longevity and a continued threat for isolated damaging winds.

...Upper Midwest...
Daytime heating along with a plume of modest low-level moisture
along/near a surface front should aid in the development of isolated
to scattered thunderstorms this afternoon. Steep lapse rates aloft
and favorable deep-layer shear may support isolated hail and gusty
winds with this activity through the early evening, before it
eventually weakens with the loss of daytime heating.

...Southeast...
Isolated instances of marginally severe hail and/or damaging winds
may occur with convection forecast to increase in coverage this
afternoon across parts of the Southeast along/south of a remnant
surface front. Generally modest flow aloft and weak deep-layer shear
should keep the overall severe threat fairly isolated/marginal.

0315 AM CDT Wed Apr 23 2025

Valid 261200Z - 011200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Days 5-7/Sun-Tue -- Great Plains to the Midwest...

Forecast guidance is in good agreement that a deepening upper trough
over the western states will eject eastward across the Plains and
Midwest early next week. Beginning Day 5/Sun, the upper trough will
extend from the central Rockies to the Southwest, with a belt of
strong southeasterly flow emerging over the central/southern High
Plains Sunday night. Surface lee low development is forecast over
the northern/central Plains Sunday afternoon, with the low moving
into SD/NE by Monday morning. Southerly low-level flow will
transport ample moisture northward across the Plains and Mid-MO
Valley on Sunday, with a sharpening dryline extending southward from
western NE into western TX. Some severe potential could develop
along the dryline and near the surface low/triple point. However,
forecast soundings maintain strong capping and any convective
development could be rather sparse. For now, this will preclude
severe probabilities for Day 5/Sun. 

On Day 6/Mon, the upper trough will continue eastward, moving into
the Plains by Tuesday morning. Ahead of the trough, a belt of strong
southwesterly flow aloft will extend from OK into the Upper Midwest.
A deepening surface low over SD will shift east/northeast through
the period, with a trailing cold front shifting east/southeast
across the Plains. Rich boundary layer moisture within a moderate to
strongly unstable airmass and favorable shear parameter space will
support an all-hazards severe weather episode across a fairly broad
area from OK to MN/WI Monday afternoon into Monday night.

Severe potential is likely to continue into Day 7/Tue, though some
differences within medium range guidance with the evolution of the
upper trough and key surface features does result in a bit more
uncertainty compared to Monday, especially on the eastward extent of
severe potential. Nevertheless, strong forcing atop a broad warm
sector ahead of an eastward advancing cold front will continue to
support severe potential from northeast Texas into Lower MI.

Areas affected...portions of western Oklahoma...south-central Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 222025Z - 222230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Damaging wind and severe hail risk to increase through the
afternoon/evening.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm activity has initiated and expected to
continue to form along the dryline across the Texas Panhandle this
afternoon. Additional thunderstorm development is expected across
the frontal boundary draped across western/central Kansas into the
Oklahoma Panhandle. Ahead of this development, the air mass across
western Oklahoma into central/eastern Kansas has been suppressed
owing to weak forcing and stout MLCIN most of the afternoon.
Temperatures are warming, with MLCIN eroding west to east across the
Texas Panhandle as temperatures have climbed into the 80s. Aloft
sounding analysis indicates, steep lapse rates and ample CAPE above
the 850 mb inversion.

Thunderstorm activity will gradually shift into this region by late
afternoon/evening. A mix of multi-cell clusters and embedded
supercells capable of large hail and damaging wind are expected. A
watch will likely be needed in the coming hours to cover this risk.

Areas affected...southwestern Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 221917Z - 222115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Damaging wind and hail risk to increase through the
afternoon/evening.

DISCUSSION...Surface analysis shows the dryline extending across the
Texas Panhandle into far eastern New Mexico and southward to the
Texas Big Bend as on 19z. Daytime heating under mostly sunny skies
has led temperatures to rise into the 80s (some mid to upper 80s
further south near the Mexico border). Satellite data shows towering
cu, mainly near and adjacent to the higher terrain of the Cap Rock
and Stockton Plateau. Morning observed soundings from AMA and LUB
would suggest that convective temperatures are around 80-85 F, which
in combination with increase in towering cu suggests initiation over
the next 1-2 hours. 

Initial development will likely be supercellular. Though flow aloft
and deep layer shear are more marginal, MLCAPE around 1500-2500 J/kg
and steep low to mid-level lapse rates will support potential for
large hail (some very large 2"+) and damaging wind. Where discrete
modes can interact with outflow/boundaries enhancing surface
vorticity, a tornado could be possible. As storms increase in
coverage this afternoon, clustering along outflows will tend to
create mixed mode of supercells and multi-cells, with an increase in
potential for damaging wind (some 70-80 mph). A watch will be needed
to cover these threats soon.

0214 PM CDT Tue Apr 22 2025

Areas affected...the South Carolina and North Carolina Piedmont

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 221914Z - 222145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Widely scattered thunderstorm activity may continue to
gradually develop and strengthen through 5-7 PM EDT, accompanied by
at least some risk for marginally severe hail and potentially
damaging surface gusts.  This may remain fairly localized and a
severe weather watch is not anticipated, but trends will continue to
be monitored.

DISCUSSION...Widely scattered thunderstorm development appears
underway, perhaps supported by subtle mid-level cooling on the
northwestern periphery of deep-layer ridging centered off the south
Atlantic coast.  Based on forecast soundings, destabilization for a
modestly moist and warming boundary layer remains inhibited by weak
high-level lapse rates.  However, CAPE within the mixed-phase layer
might still be sufficient to support small to marginally severe
hail, aided by favorable shear beneath a 40 kt southwesterly jet
streak around 500 mb.  

Lower-level wind fields will remain more modest, but with at least
some further boundary-layer destabilization through peak daytime
heating, scattered thunderstorm activity will probably continue to
intensify.  And downward mixing of momentum may lead to a few
potentially damaging wind gusts, before storms weaken this evening.

Areas affected...parts of cntrl/sern LA...srn MS...swrn/cntrl AL

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 221830Z - 222130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A gradual increase in thunderstorm activity and intensity
appears probable through 4-6 PM CDT, with short-lived stronger
storms posing a risk for locally severe hail and wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...As low-amplitude mid-level troughing and more subtle
smaller-scale perturbations progress through weak (on the order of
10-20 kt) west-southwesterly mean flow across the Gulf Coast states,
associated forcing for ascent appears likely to contribute to
increasing thunderstorm development through 21-23Z.  Inhibition for
moist boundary-layer parcels (with dew points near 70F) is becoming 
increasingly negligible with continuing insolation, with modestly
steep lower/mid-tropospheric lapse rates contributing to CAPE around
1500-2000+ J/kg.  

Despite the rather modest to weak low-level and deep-layer shear,
thunderstorms are likely to continue to slowly intensify within the
destabilizing environment, into and beyond peak daytime heating. 
Stronger updraft pulses may eventually pose increasing potential to
produce severe hail and damaging downbursts.  As convection begins
to consolidate and become more widespread, this threat should
diminish, but strengthening convective outflow may continue to pose
potential for gusty/locally damaging winds into early evening.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 159
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
315 PM CDT Tue Apr 22 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  West Texas

* Effective this Tuesday afternoon and evening from 315 PM until
  1100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 75
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter likely
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will develop and increase in coverage
through the afternoon and evening across much of west Texas, in an
increasingly moist and unstable environment.  The strongest cells
are expected to produce large hail and damaging wind gusts.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 70
statute miles east and west of a line from 45 miles northeast of
Amarillo TX to 35 miles east of Dryden TX. For a complete depiction
of the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 65 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
27025.

Mesoscale Discussion 0504
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0246 PM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

Areas affected...Northwest/north-central Arkansas into southern
Missouri

Concerning...Tornado Watch 154...

Valid 201946Z - 202115Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 154 continues.

SUMMARY...Storms moving into north-central Arkansas and southern
Missouri will pose a risk of tornadoes--some strong--and damaging
winds. There are signs of discrete storms within the line in
northwest/west-central Arkansas. These storms would bring the
greatest tornado risk.

DISCUSSION...KSRX radar imagery shows a few semi-discrete storms in
far western Arkansas. MRMS CAPPI data also shows these storms
intensifying. Mid-level ascent with southern extent will remain more
limited, but deep-layer shear vectors slightly more perpendicular to
the cold front will also favor discrete storms. VAD data from
KSGF/KLZK/KLSX all have shown an increase in low-level SRH over the
past couple of hours. This trend should continue, particularly in
Missouri. Supercell and QLCS tornadoes, some of which could be
strong, are all possible in this environment. Additionally, the more
linear convective elements will also pose a threat of wind damage.

Mesoscale Discussion 0502
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0220 PM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

Areas affected...Eastern Missouri into western Illinois and far
southeastern Iowa

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 201920Z - 202115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A tornado watch will be forthcoming for portions of
eastern Missouri into western Illinois and far southeastern Iowa, as
a warm frontal boundary continues to lift northward out of central
Missouri.

DISCUSSION...Breaks in cloud cover, along with a northward-lifting
surface warm frontal boundary, have resulted in continued
destabilization across eastern Missouri into western Illinois. With
mixed-layer CAPE forecast to exceed 1000 J/kg in the presence of
strong wind shear (and strong curvature of the low-level hodograph
in the vicinity of the front), the tornado threat is expected to
increase this afternoon into the evening hours. 

Ongoing storms along the MO/KS/OK borders are forecast to continue
north and east into the new watch area, with supercells embedded
within a largely linear complex. Any embedded supercells (especially
any within the vicinity of the warm front), as well as any
pre-frontal storms, will have access to an environment characterized
by strong low-level shear/streamwise vorticity supportive of tornado
development. Current VAD wind profiles from KLSX show 200 m^2/s^2 of
0-500m storm relative helicity -- nearly double what is shown in the
current SPC Mesoanalysis. Given the environmental support for
tornadoes, some of which may be strong, a tornado watch is
anticipated within the next hour or two.

* Primary threats include...
  Several tornadoes likely with a couple intense tornadoes
    possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Scattered large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A steady increase in coverage and intensity of
thunderstorms is expected to occur over the next several hours, with
severe-weather potential evolving from eastern Oklahoma and the
Arklatex region northward into Missouri.  Along with risk for fairly
widespread damaging wind gusts and hail, several tornadoes are
expected -- including potential for a few that are
strong/longer-lived.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 75 statute miles
east and west of a line from 45 miles north of Springfield MO to 25
miles west of Texarkana AR. For a complete depiction of the watch
see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU4).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.
