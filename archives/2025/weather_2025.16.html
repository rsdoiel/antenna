Valid 221300Z - 231200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE SOUTHERN/CENTRAL PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated to scattered severe thunderstorms will be possible across
parts of the southern/central Plains, mainly this afternoon and
evening. Large hail and severe gusts should be the main threats.

...Southern/Central Plains...
Stronger westerly flow aloft should remain confined to the northern
tier of the CONUS today, and to the north of the surface warm
sector. Multiple weak mid-level disturbances may drift eastward
across the southern/central High Plains through this evening, with
fairly modest mid-level flow for late April standards. At the
surface, a front will extend from parts of the Upper Midwest to
southwest KS near a weak surface low. A dryline will extend
southward from this low over the southern High Plains. Some eastward
mixing of the dryline is forecast by late afternoon, especially
across the OK/TX Panhandles. Otherwise, little movement of the front
is anticipated through this evening.

Both of these surface boundaries should provide some focus for
convective development this afternoon and evening, even with
large-scale forcing for ascent remaining rather nebulous. Weak to
locally moderate instability should develop through the afternoon
with diurnal heating of a partially modified Gulf airmass. Even
though west-southwesterly mid-level flow is expected to remain
fairly modest, weak low-level winds gradually veering/strengthening
with height though mid/upper levels should support sufficient
deep-layer shear for some updraft organization. A mix of widely
spaced supercells and multicells may eventually develop along both
the front and dryline, with uncertainty remaining rather high about
favored locations for robust convective development. Regardless,
this activity could pose a threat for isolated to scattered large
hail given steep lapse rates aloft. Any clusters that can evolve
through the late afternoon and evening may also have some severe
wind threat given steep low-level lapse rates. Some trimming was
made to the northwest extent of severe probabilities based on the
forecast position of the front/dryline later today.

...Southeast to the Carolinas...
A weak front draped southwest to northeast is forecast to move
little today across the Southeast. Generally modest
west-southwesterly mid-level flow is expected to prevail, with
slightly stronger winds aloft forecast over the Carolinas. This
should tend to limit deep-layer shear and convective
organization/intensity. Still, with some destabilization forecast
and fairly cool temperatures aloft, any clusters of convection that
can develop along/south of the front may pose an isolated threat for
damaging winds and perhaps marginally severe hail. Based on latest
observational and guidance trends showing greater thunderstorm
coverage this afternoon across parts of AL into northern GA, have
connected the two Marginal Risk areas with this update.

0312 AM CDT Tue Apr 22 2025

Valid 251200Z - 301200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Days 4-5/Fri-Sat -- Central/Southern Plains...

An upper ridge will build over the Plains toward the MS Valley this
weekend as a deepening upper trough develops over the western U.S.
Some lead shortwave impulses will likely migrate through the ridge,
and southwesterly flow increases over the central/southern Rockies.
At the surface, persistent south/southeasterly low-level flow will
maintain a warm advection regime across the southern/central Plains,
while a daily surface dryline evolves over the High Plains. While
some severe potential may occur Friday and Saturday over parts the
central/southern Plains, uncertainty remains quite high given
several periods of convection leading into Friday, as well as
ongoing convection Friday morning, and possible capping concerns
beneath the upper ridge both days. This precludes 15 percent
probability delineation at this time, but probabilities may be
needed in subsequent outlooks as smaller scale details become better
resolved.

...Days 6-8/Sun-Tue -- Great Plains to the Upper Midwest...

A more active severe weather period is possible early next week as
the western U.S. trough develops eastward into the Plains and Great
Lakes vicinity. The upper trough may begin ejecting into the
southern/central Plains as early as Day 6/Sun. However, the timing
of this feature may be ill-timed with peak diurnal
heating/destabilization such that stronger large-scale ascent and
increasing southwesterly flow aloft arrive overnight. Forecast
soundings Sunday afternoon suggest capping may limit convection.

By Day 7/Mon, a strong midlevel jet streak should overspread
portions of the central/southern Plains into the Upper Midwest. Lee
cyclogenesis is forecast across the central High Plains, resulting
in a sharpening dryline across portions of the Great Plains, and
warm front extending across the eastern Dakotas to the Mid-MS
Valley. Rich Gulf moisture will be in place across the warm sector
and widely scattered severe storms appear possible from Monday
afternoon into Monday night. As is typical at longer time frames,
forecast guidance differs in exact timing and placement of key
features. However, the overall pattern is favorable for an
all-hazards severe weather episode, and a 15 percent delineation has
been included, though this area may shift over the coming days as
details become better resolved. 

Severe potential may continue into Day 8/Tue across portions of the
Midwest to the southern Plains as a shortwave upper trough continues
across the Great Lakes into southeast Canada, and a cold front
impinges southeastward over portions of the region. Uncertainty
increases considerably during this time, precluding 15 percent
probabilities at this time.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0148 AM CDT Tue Apr 22 2025

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...Synopsis...
Broad cyclonic flow will overspread the western CONUS as modest
upper ridging builds over the central and eastern U.S. tomorrow
(Wednesday). A weak embedded impulse will traverse the Desert
Southwest, encouraging stronger surface flow over portions of
eastern Arizona into Far West Texas Wednesday afternoon. Over 15 mph
sustained southwesterly surface winds amid 10-15 percent RH will
overspread drying fuels, warranting the introduction of Elevated
highlights.

Meanwhile, in the western Florida Peninsula, strong daytime heating
of a dry boundary layer will encourage RH to dip into the 30-40
percent range. Since southeasterly surface winds may reach 10-15 mph
atop dry fuels, Elevated highlights were introduced.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE UPPER OHIO VALLEY AND LOWER GREAT LAKES...AND PORTIONS OF THE
SOUTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms are possible today across
the upper Ohio Valley/lower Great Lakes and parts of the Southeast.
Damaging winds and marginally severe hail are the primary risks.

...20Z Update...
The Marginal risk in the Lower Great Lakes was trimmed behind the
eastward-moving frontal band of convection. Elsewhere, the forecast
remains on track and minimal changes were made with this update. For
details on the near-term severe risk, reference MCDs #512 and #513.

..Weinman.. 04/21/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1124 AM CDT Mon Apr 21 2025/

...Upper OH Valley...
Morning surface analysis and satellite imagery show a cold front
sweeping eastward across OH.  Considerable cloud cover is present
ahead of the front, but a narrow corridor of heating immediately
ahead of the front will allow a period of heating - promoting
scattered thunderstorms.  Low-level moisture is limited with
dewpoints only in the 50s, and forecast soundings show CAPE values
generally below 1000 J/kg.  Nevertheless, strong low and mid-level
winds and considerable vertical shear will promote a risk of a few
organized/severe storms capable of damaging wind gusts and perhaps a
tornado or two.  Refer to upcoming MCD #511 for further details.

...LA/MS/AL/GA/TN...
The aforementioned surface cold front extends southeastward across
west TN.  A relatively moist air mass is present ahead of the front
from southeast LA into parts of MS/AL and middle/east TN, although
considerable cloud cover will limit heating.  Most 12z models
suggest scattered thunderstorms will form in this zone during the
late afternoon and evening, with sufficient CAPE for a few robust
updrafts.  Low and mid level winds are not particularly strong, and
large scale forcing is weak.  This should limit the overall
organization and severity of storms, but a few cells may produce
gusty winds and hail.

...SD...
Water vapor imagery shows a mid-level shortwave trough over WY
approaching SD.  Forcing ahead of this feature will likely lead to
scattered high-based showers and thunderstorms across eastern WY and
western/central SD this afternoon and evening.  There is some chance
that a storm or two could produce locally damaging wind gusts.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
WEST TEXAS AND FAR SOUTHEAST NEW MEXICO...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible across portions of the
central and southern High Plains on Wednesday.

...Central/Southern High Plains...
Persistent southwesterly flow will be present across the western and
central United States on Wednesday. This will result in continue lee
surface troughing across the southern and central High Plains. A
stalled frontal boundary will extend from the Upper Midwest to the
central High Plains. Continued low-level moisture advection should
destabilize the warm sector east of the dryline. Any weak
perturbations within the southwesterly flow aloft should provide
ample forcing for storm development along the dryline within a
mostly uncapped airmass (per 12Z GFS forecast soundings). If this
GFS solution verifies, a slight risk will probably be needed across
much of the dryline from the Trans Pecos to eastern Colorado.
However, the ECMWF has an extensive area of precipitation along the
front in Kansas Wednesday morning which expands across much of the
state and into Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. This would have
significant implications on warm sector destabilization and
northward moisture transport on Wednesday. Due to this uncertainty
have kept probabilities at Level 1/Marginal at this time from the
Texas Panhandle northward. Farther south, across West Texas,
Confidence in a moderately unstable, uncapped airmass along the
dryline is higher. Therefore, a slight risk (Level 2 of 5) has been
added in this area for the potential for large hail and severe wind
gusts Wednesday afternoon/evening.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS AND INTO PARTS OF SOUTHERN KANSAS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated to scattered severe thunderstorms are possible on Tuesday
across portions of the southern Plains.

...Synopsis...
A mostly zonal pattern will be in place across the CONUS with
multiple embedded weak shortwave troughs on Tuesday. One such trough
which is forecast to move across New Mexico during the afternoon may
result in some weak lee troughing and support the potential for
isolated to scattered severe storms along the dryline Tuesday
afternoon.

...Southern High Plains...
Low-level moisture will advect northward across West Texas ahead of
a dryline Tuesday morning. Strong surface heating will lead to
moderate to strong destabilization along and ahead of the dryline.
Forecast soundings show a weakly capped airmass which should be
sufficient for isolated to scattered thunderstorm development by mid
to late afternoon as weak forcing from the mid-level trough
overspreads the dryline. 30 to 35 knots of shear should support
high-based, slow-moving supercells with a threat for large hail and
severe wind gusts. An isolated tornado threat may also exist where
better low-level moisture is present, farther south, and where
intersecting boundaries could enhance low-level vorticity ingestion.

Upscale growth may eventually occur with one or more MCSs moving
east into the evening and overnight hours, supported by a modestly
enhanced low-level jet.

...Northern Panhandle into Kansas...
A surface front is forecast to extend across Kansas and into the
OK/northern TX Panhandle by Tuesday afternoon. Only modest moisture
recovery will occur this far north, but it may be sufficient for
moderate instability along the front by mid-afternoon. 25 to 30
knots of shear will support some storm organization. Very steep
lapse rates and a relatively dry profile will support the potential
for isolated large hail and severe wind gusts. 

...IA/WI/IL...
A stalled frontal boundary will be in place across the Mid-MO Valley
into southern WI on Tuesday. Modest moisture return and persistent
isentropic ascent along this boundary may be sufficient for isolated
thunderstorm development amid weak diurnal destabilization. Low to
midlevel flow will remain rather weak, but rapidly increase above
700 mb, supporting effective shear magnitudes greater than 40 kt.
Cold temperatures aloft (-17 C near 500 mb) will support MLCAPE to
around 500 J/kg, and isolated convection could produce sporadic hail
or damaging wind gusts.

...Carolinas...
A cold front associated with a surface low over Quebec will move 
southeast across the Mid-Atlantic and Carolinas during the
afternoon/evening. Strong heating of a modestly moist boundary layer
ahead of the front will support a corridor of MLCAPE up to 1000-1500
J/kg. Weak low-level southwesterly flow will increase with height,
support effective shear magnitudes up to 35 kt. This should be
sufficient for a few stronger/organized cells. Steep low-level lapse
rates and somewhat elongated hodographs suggest transient supercells
capable of strong gusts and isolated hail will be possible. In
addition, any storms which interact with the sea breeze could have
locally enhanced updrafts and a periodically greater large
hail/damaging wind threat.

Mesoscale Discussion 0504
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0246 PM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

Areas affected...Northwest/north-central Arkansas into southern
Missouri

Concerning...Tornado Watch 154...

Valid 201946Z - 202115Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 154 continues.

SUMMARY...Storms moving into north-central Arkansas and southern
Missouri will pose a risk of tornadoes--some strong--and damaging
winds. There are signs of discrete storms within the line in
northwest/west-central Arkansas. These storms would bring the
greatest tornado risk.

DISCUSSION...KSRX radar imagery shows a few semi-discrete storms in
far western Arkansas. MRMS CAPPI data also shows these storms
intensifying. Mid-level ascent with southern extent will remain more
limited, but deep-layer shear vectors slightly more perpendicular to
the cold front will also favor discrete storms. VAD data from
KSGF/KLZK/KLSX all have shown an increase in low-level SRH over the
past couple of hours. This trend should continue, particularly in
Missouri. Supercell and QLCS tornadoes, some of which could be
strong, are all possible in this environment. Additionally, the more
linear convective elements will also pose a threat of wind damage.

Mesoscale Discussion 0502
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0220 PM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

Areas affected...Eastern Missouri into western Illinois and far
southeastern Iowa

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 201920Z - 202115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A tornado watch will be forthcoming for portions of
eastern Missouri into western Illinois and far southeastern Iowa, as
a warm frontal boundary continues to lift northward out of central
Missouri.

DISCUSSION...Breaks in cloud cover, along with a northward-lifting
surface warm frontal boundary, have resulted in continued
destabilization across eastern Missouri into western Illinois. With
mixed-layer CAPE forecast to exceed 1000 J/kg in the presence of
strong wind shear (and strong curvature of the low-level hodograph
in the vicinity of the front), the tornado threat is expected to
increase this afternoon into the evening hours. 

Ongoing storms along the MO/KS/OK borders are forecast to continue
north and east into the new watch area, with supercells embedded
within a largely linear complex. Any embedded supercells (especially
any within the vicinity of the warm front), as well as any
pre-frontal storms, will have access to an environment characterized
by strong low-level shear/streamwise vorticity supportive of tornado
development. Current VAD wind profiles from KLSX show 200 m^2/s^2 of
0-500m storm relative helicity -- nearly double what is shown in the
current SPC Mesoanalysis. Given the environmental support for
tornadoes, some of which may be strong, a tornado watch is
anticipated within the next hour or two.

* Primary threats include...
  Several tornadoes likely with a couple intense tornadoes
    possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Scattered large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A steady increase in coverage and intensity of
thunderstorms is expected to occur over the next several hours, with
severe-weather potential evolving from eastern Oklahoma and the
Arklatex region northward into Missouri.  Along with risk for fairly
widespread damaging wind gusts and hail, several tornadoes are
expected -- including potential for a few that are
strong/longer-lived.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 75 statute miles
east and west of a line from 45 miles north of Springfield MO to 25
miles west of Texarkana AR. For a complete depiction of the watch
see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU4).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.
