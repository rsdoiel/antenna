Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0742 AM CDT Wed Apr 23 2025

Valid 231300Z - 241200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE SOUTHERN/CENTRAL PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe thunderstorms are forecast over parts of
the southern/central Plains today and tonight, with large hail and
damaging winds possible.

...Southern/Central Plains...
Convective clusters have persisted through the early morning hours
across parts of TX, aided by modest low-level warm/moist advection.
This activity has generally weakened, but it could still pose some
threat for mainly isolated gusty winds towards the ArkLaTex and
Upper TX Coast. In its wake, a convectively overturned airmass will
exist today over much of central TX, while modified low-level
moisture will once again advect west-northwestward over the
southern/central High Plains. A similar convective scenario to
yesterday remains apparent, with generally modest west-southwesterly
mid-level flow present over much of the southern/central Plains.
Multiple low-amplitude perturbations should advance
east-northeastward in this regime across the central CONUS through
the period. At the surface, a front draped southwest to northeast
over the central Plains and a dryline extending southward over the
southern Plains should both serve as foci for convective initiation
later today.

Steep mid-level lapse rates are once again expected to be in place
across the warm sector. Diurnal heating of a modestly moist
low-level airmass in combination with these steep lapse rates should
aid in the development of moderate to locally strong instability by
mid afternoon. Weak low-level winds veering and gradually
strengthening with height through mid/upper levels will foster
around 25-35 kt of effective bulk shear, which should be adequate
for modest convective organization. Current expectations are for
isolated to scattered thunderstorms to once again develop along both
the front and dryline by mid to late afternoon. A mix of multicells
and slow-moving supercells is anticipated, with associated threats
for both severe/damaging winds and large hail. 

The Slight Risk has been expanded northeastward across KS and into
far southern NE based on latest guidance trends showing greater
coverage of potentially intense thunderstorms this afternoon/evening
along and near the front. The potential for thunderstorms to grow
upscale into one or more clusters this evening remains uncertain
owing to weak large-scale forcing for ascent. Even so, a
strengthening low-level jet overnight may aid in convective
longevity and a continued threat for isolated damaging winds.

...Upper Midwest...
Daytime heating along with a plume of modest low-level moisture
along/near a surface front should aid in the development of isolated
to scattered thunderstorms this afternoon. Steep lapse rates aloft
and favorable deep-layer shear may support isolated hail and gusty
winds with this activity through the early evening, before it
eventually weakens with the loss of daytime heating.

...Southeast...
Isolated instances of marginally severe hail and/or damaging winds
may occur with convection forecast to increase in coverage this
afternoon across parts of the Southeast along/south of a remnant
surface front. Generally modest flow aloft and weak deep-layer shear
should keep the overall severe threat fairly isolated/marginal.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook

0315 AM CDT Wed Apr 23 2025

Valid 261200Z - 011200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Days 5-7/Sun-Tue -- Great Plains to the Midwest...

Forecast guidance is in good agreement that a deepening upper trough
over the western states will eject eastward across the Plains and
Midwest early next week. Beginning Day 5/Sun, the upper trough will
extend from the central Rockies to the Southwest, with a belt of
strong southeasterly flow emerging over the central/southern High
Plains Sunday night. Surface lee low development is forecast over
the northern/central Plains Sunday afternoon, with the low moving
into SD/NE by Monday morning. Southerly low-level flow will
transport ample moisture northward across the Plains and Mid-MO
Valley on Sunday, with a sharpening dryline extending southward from
western NE into western TX. Some severe potential could develop
along the dryline and near the surface low/triple point. However,
forecast soundings maintain strong capping and any convective
development could be rather sparse. For now, this will preclude
severe probabilities for Day 5/Sun. 

On Day 6/Mon, the upper trough will continue eastward, moving into
the Plains by Tuesday morning. Ahead of the trough, a belt of strong
southwesterly flow aloft will extend from OK into the Upper Midwest.
A deepening surface low over SD will shift east/northeast through
the period, with a trailing cold front shifting east/southeast
across the Plains. Rich boundary layer moisture within a moderate to
strongly unstable airmass and favorable shear parameter space will
support an all-hazards severe weather episode across a fairly broad
area from OK to MN/WI Monday afternoon into Monday night.

Severe potential is likely to continue into Day 7/Tue, though some
differences within medium range guidance with the evolution of the
upper trough and key surface features does result in a bit more
uncertainty compared to Monday, especially on the eastward extent of
severe potential. Nevertheless, strong forcing atop a broad warm
sector ahead of an eastward advancing cold front will continue to
support severe potential from northeast Texas into Lower MI.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 AM CDT Wed Apr 23 2025

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will impinge on the California coastline while
generally upper-ridging builds over the central and eastern CONUS
tomorrow (Thursday). Dry and occasionally breezy conditions are
possible across parts of the Desert Southwest. However, the latest
guidance consensus suggests that the surface wind field across
Arizona into New Mexico will be too weak to warrant Elevated
highlights at this time. Otherwise, another day of dry southeasterly
winds will encourage Elevated wildfire-spread potential across
western portions of the Florida Peninsula.

0325 PM CDT Tue Apr 22 2025

Areas affected...portions of western Oklahoma...south-central Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 222025Z - 222230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Damaging wind and severe hail risk to increase through the
afternoon/evening.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm activity has initiated and expected to
continue to form along the dryline across the Texas Panhandle this
afternoon. Additional thunderstorm development is expected across
the frontal boundary draped across western/central Kansas into the
Oklahoma Panhandle. Ahead of this development, the air mass across
western Oklahoma into central/eastern Kansas has been suppressed
owing to weak forcing and stout MLCIN most of the afternoon.
Temperatures are warming, with MLCIN eroding west to east across the
Texas Panhandle as temperatures have climbed into the 80s. Aloft
sounding analysis indicates, steep lapse rates and ample CAPE above
the 850 mb inversion.

Thunderstorm activity will gradually shift into this region by late
afternoon/evening. A mix of multi-cell clusters and embedded
supercells capable of large hail and damaging wind are expected. A
watch will likely be needed in the coming hours to cover this risk.

Mesoscale Discussion 0516
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0217 PM CDT Tue Apr 22 2025

Areas affected...southwestern Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 221917Z - 222115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Damaging wind and hail risk to increase through the
afternoon/evening.

DISCUSSION...Surface analysis shows the dryline extending across the
Texas Panhandle into far eastern New Mexico and southward to the
Texas Big Bend as on 19z. Daytime heating under mostly sunny skies
has led temperatures to rise into the 80s (some mid to upper 80s
further south near the Mexico border). Satellite data shows towering
cu, mainly near and adjacent to the higher terrain of the Cap Rock
and Stockton Plateau. Morning observed soundings from AMA and LUB
would suggest that convective temperatures are around 80-85 F, which
in combination with increase in towering cu suggests initiation over
the next 1-2 hours. 

Initial development will likely be supercellular. Though flow aloft
and deep layer shear are more marginal, MLCAPE around 1500-2500 J/kg
and steep low to mid-level lapse rates will support potential for
large hail (some very large 2"+) and damaging wind. Where discrete
modes can interact with outflow/boundaries enhancing surface
vorticity, a tornado could be possible. As storms increase in
coverage this afternoon, clustering along outflows will tend to
create mixed mode of supercells and multi-cells, with an increase in
potential for damaging wind (some 70-80 mph). A watch will be needed
to cover these threats soon.

Mesoscale Discussion 0515
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0214 PM CDT Tue Apr 22 2025

Areas affected...the South Carolina and North Carolina Piedmont

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 221914Z - 222145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Widely scattered thunderstorm activity may continue to
gradually develop and strengthen through 5-7 PM EDT, accompanied by
at least some risk for marginally severe hail and potentially
damaging surface gusts.  This may remain fairly localized and a
severe weather watch is not anticipated, but trends will continue to
be monitored.

DISCUSSION...Widely scattered thunderstorm development appears
underway, perhaps supported by subtle mid-level cooling on the
northwestern periphery of deep-layer ridging centered off the south
Atlantic coast.  Based on forecast soundings, destabilization for a
modestly moist and warming boundary layer remains inhibited by weak
high-level lapse rates.  However, CAPE within the mixed-phase layer
might still be sufficient to support small to marginally severe
hail, aided by favorable shear beneath a 40 kt southwesterly jet
streak around 500 mb.  

Lower-level wind fields will remain more modest, but with at least
some further boundary-layer destabilization through peak daytime
heating, scattered thunderstorm activity will probably continue to
intensify.  And downward mixing of momentum may lead to a few
potentially damaging wind gusts, before storms weaken this evening.

Areas affected...parts of cntrl/sern LA...srn MS...swrn/cntrl AL

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 221830Z - 222130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A gradual increase in thunderstorm activity and intensity
appears probable through 4-6 PM CDT, with short-lived stronger
storms posing a risk for locally severe hail and wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...As low-amplitude mid-level troughing and more subtle
smaller-scale perturbations progress through weak (on the order of
10-20 kt) west-southwesterly mean flow across the Gulf Coast states,
associated forcing for ascent appears likely to contribute to
increasing thunderstorm development through 21-23Z.  Inhibition for
moist boundary-layer parcels (with dew points near 70F) is becoming 
increasingly negligible with continuing insolation, with modestly
steep lower/mid-tropospheric lapse rates contributing to CAPE around
1500-2000+ J/kg.  

Despite the rather modest to weak low-level and deep-layer shear,
thunderstorms are likely to continue to slowly intensify within the
destabilizing environment, into and beyond peak daytime heating. 
Stronger updraft pulses may eventually pose increasing potential to
produce severe hail and damaging downbursts.  As convection begins
to consolidate and become more widespread, this threat should
diminish, but strengthening convective outflow may continue to pose
potential for gusty/locally damaging winds into early evening.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 159
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
315 PM CDT Tue Apr 22 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  West Texas

* Effective this Tuesday afternoon and evening from 315 PM until
  1100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 75
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter likely
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will develop and increase in coverage
through the afternoon and evening across much of west Texas, in an
increasingly moist and unstable environment.  The strongest cells
are expected to produce large hail and damaging wind gusts.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 70
statute miles east and west of a line from 45 miles northeast of
Amarillo TX to 35 miles east of Dryden TX. For a complete depiction
of the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0250 PM CDT Tue Apr 22 2025

Valid 222000Z - 231200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE SOUTHERN/CENTRAL PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated to scattered severe thunderstorms will be possible across
parts of the southern/central Plains, mainly this afternoon and
evening. Large hail and severe gusts should be the main threats.

...20z Update...
The primary change for this forecast update is an inclusion of
significant hail/wind areas to portions of western TX into far
southwestern OK. Recent GOES visible imagery shows developing
cumulus across the Trans Pecos region of southwest TX and across
parts of the southern TX Panhandle. This lends confidence in
convective development within the coming hours as anticipated by
recent high-res guidance. The combination of low-level moisture
return and steep/very steep (8-9 C/km) mid-level lapse rates is
supporting lifted indices of -8 to -10 C across the Stockton and
eastern Edwards plateaus. This thermodynamic environment, coupled
with 30-40 knots of effective bulk shear, should favor robust
supercell development with the potential for significant (2+ inch)
hail. Recent WOFS guidance appears to be capturing ongoing
convective trends in southwest TX well, and also hints at this
potential. Further north, very steep low-level lapse rates should
promote downdraft accelerations that may favor isolated gusts
upwards of 70-80 mph. This potential is also hinted in recent WOFS 
and HRRR solutions. See MCD #516 for additional near-term details
regarding western TX. 

...Southeast Virginia...
Hail/wind risk probabilities are also expanded into far southeast VA
downstream of ongoing strong/severe thunderstorms where broken cloud
cover has allowed temperatures to warm into the low 80s with an
attendant increase in buoyancy. See MCD #515 for additional details.

..Moore.. 04/22/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1117 AM CDT Tue Apr 22 2025/

...Central/Southern Plains...
Morning water vapor imagery shows broad zonal flow across the
central US, with the main upper jet across the northern states. 
Mostly clear skies and southerly low-level winds across much of west
TX/OK and central KS will help to destabilize the air mass along a
developing dryline, leading to afternoon MLCAPE values around 1500
J/kg and minimal cap.  Large scale forcing is weak, but dryline
circulations will likely lead to scattered afternoon and early
evening thunderstorm development.  Relatively slow-moving storms
capable of large hail and damaging wind gusts are expected.  Several
12z CAM solutions suggest upscale growth of convection over
northwest TX after dark, with some risk of strong/severe storms
reaching central TX overnight.

...IA/MO/IL...
A weak surface boundary extends across southern IA this morning. 
The southern fringe of stronger westerly flow aloft lies across this
region, with water vapor imagery suggesting a subtle shortwave
trough over NE approaching the region.  A few thunderstorms are
expected to form along the boundary by late afternoon/early evening,
with some risk of hail and gusty winds in the strongest storms.

...Southeast States...
A diffuse surface boundary extends from LA northeastward across
MS/AL/GA into the Carolinas.  Ample low and mid-level moisture along
the boundary will lead to scattered afternoon thunderstorms. 
Forecast soundings show relatively weak low-level winds and poor
mid-level lapse rates.  While a few storms could produce gusty
winds, organized severe storm risk appears marginal today.

0223 PM CDT Tue Apr 22 2025

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM SOUTHERN
KANSAS TO THE TRANSPECOS REGION OF TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible on Thursday from western
Texas and Oklahoma into southern Kansas.

...Southern Kansas southwestward to the Transpecos region of
Texas...
Thunderstorms are forecast to be ongoing at the start of the period
near a weak front lying roughly west-to-east across Kansas.  As the
storms sag southeastward with time, the combined front/convective
outflow will continue making slow southward progress.

Meanwhile, daytime heating/mixing across the Texas Panhandle/South
Plains/Transpecos will support eastward mixing of a dryline through
the afternoon.  With a moist boundary layer east of the dryline,
heating combined with the steep lapse rates/EML being maintained
across the area by moderate west-southwesterlies aloft will result
in moderate destabilization.  This should support isolated storm
development near the dryline, perhaps most focused where the
southward-sagging outflow/cold front from Kansas intersects the
eastward-mixing dryline (somewhere in the southwestern
Kansas/northwestern Oklahoma/Texas Panhandle vicinity).  

The lack of stronger flow aloft should continue to limit shear
across the southern Plains region, but veering winds with height
should again support potential for mid-level rotation.  Attendant
risks for large hail and locally gusty/damaging winds warrant
continuation of MRGL/5% severe probability.  Some thought was given
to a small SLGT risk upgrade, near the intersection of the dryline
and the outflow-reinforced front mentioned earlier, as backed
low-level flow may yield a bit more favorable of a wind profile
locally.  However, with some uncertainty evident with respect to if,
and how far, the front can progress southward through the day, have
opted not to upgrade at this time.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1231 PM CDT Tue Apr 22 2025

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF
THE EASTERN NEW MEXICO AND ADJACENT PORTIONS OF THE TEXAS SOUTH
PLAINS AND TRANSPECOS REGION...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible across portions of the
central and southern High Plains on Wednesday.

...Central Plains to the southern High Plains...
Moderate west-southwesterly flow aloft is forecast aloft across the
Plains, with only weak/embedded disturbances within this flow field
forecast to shift eastward across the Plains region.  Still, with
the westerlies aloft maintaining weak lee troughing and potentially
a weak low over the southeastern Colorado vicinity, low-level
southerlies across the central/southern Plains will maintain a
seasonably moist boundary layer.

While convection and associated cloud cover ongoing early in the day
-- particularly across the central Plains -- may hinder
destabilization locally, afternoon insolation should support 1000 to
2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE across a fairly broad area.  New storm
development should occur across the Iowa/Nebraska Kansas area during
the afternoon, though location/coverage will likely be modulated by
aforementioned/earlier storms and associated outflows.  Where ample
destabilization occurs, a few clusters of convection capable of
producing locally strong/gusty winds and marginal hail can be
expected.

Greater severe risk -- associated with isolated supercell potential
-- remains evident over the southern High Plains area and into the
Transpecos region of Texas.  Here, a less perturbed airmass should
heat/destabilize through the day, ahead of an evolving dryline. 
With modest but veering flow with height, shear should be sufficient
to support mid-level rotation with stronger storms.  Large hail and
locally damaging gusts will be the main risks with these storms. 
Some congealing/upscale growth may occur by early evening, as storms
spread east-northeastward across parts of western Texas, but overall
severe risk should gradually diminish diurnally.

...Parts of the Southeast...
A weak mid-level vort max is forecast to be moving eastward across
the central Gulf Coast region Wednesday afternoon, where a
heating/destabilizing airmass is expected.  Fairly steep mid-level
lapse rates should be present across the Georgia/South Carolina
vicinity, which will contribute to development of 1500 to 2000 J/kg
mixed-layer CAPE across this area.  While flow aloft will remain
relatively weak, and thus storms generally rather disorganized, the
degree of CAPE should support a few more vigorous updrafts.  Along
with potential for marginal hail, a relatively deep mixed layer
expected to evolve through peak heating could also promote some
evaporative enhancement to downdrafts -- possibly yielding locally
strong wind gusts from a few of the stronger storms.  Convection --
and any ongoing severe risk -- will diminish after sunset.

...Synopsis...
The upper-air pattern will be characterized by mainly zonal flow
with embedded perturbations across the northern half of the CONUS
today. This pattern will support a modest westerly surface wind
field across the northern Plains and over portions of the Northeast
this afternoon. Given marginally supportive RH over the northern
Plains and Northeast, wildfire spread concerns should remain
localized, especially wherever dry fuel beds exist.

Mesoscale Discussion 0504
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0246 PM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

Areas affected...Northwest/north-central Arkansas into southern
Missouri

Concerning...Tornado Watch 154...

Valid 201946Z - 202115Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 154 continues.

SUMMARY...Storms moving into north-central Arkansas and southern
Missouri will pose a risk of tornadoes--some strong--and damaging
winds. There are signs of discrete storms within the line in
northwest/west-central Arkansas. These storms would bring the
greatest tornado risk.

DISCUSSION...KSRX radar imagery shows a few semi-discrete storms in
far western Arkansas. MRMS CAPPI data also shows these storms
intensifying. Mid-level ascent with southern extent will remain more
limited, but deep-layer shear vectors slightly more perpendicular to
the cold front will also favor discrete storms. VAD data from
KSGF/KLZK/KLSX all have shown an increase in low-level SRH over the
past couple of hours. This trend should continue, particularly in
Missouri. Supercell and QLCS tornadoes, some of which could be
strong, are all possible in this environment. Additionally, the more
linear convective elements will also pose a threat of wind damage.

Mesoscale Discussion 0502
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0220 PM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

Areas affected...Eastern Missouri into western Illinois and far
southeastern Iowa

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 201920Z - 202115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A tornado watch will be forthcoming for portions of
eastern Missouri into western Illinois and far southeastern Iowa, as
a warm frontal boundary continues to lift northward out of central
Missouri.

DISCUSSION...Breaks in cloud cover, along with a northward-lifting
surface warm frontal boundary, have resulted in continued
destabilization across eastern Missouri into western Illinois. With
mixed-layer CAPE forecast to exceed 1000 J/kg in the presence of
strong wind shear (and strong curvature of the low-level hodograph
in the vicinity of the front), the tornado threat is expected to
increase this afternoon into the evening hours. 

Ongoing storms along the MO/KS/OK borders are forecast to continue
north and east into the new watch area, with supercells embedded
within a largely linear complex. Any embedded supercells (especially
any within the vicinity of the warm front), as well as any
pre-frontal storms, will have access to an environment characterized
by strong low-level shear/streamwise vorticity supportive of tornado
development. Current VAD wind profiles from KLSX show 200 m^2/s^2 of
0-500m storm relative helicity -- nearly double what is shown in the
current SPC Mesoanalysis. Given the environmental support for
tornadoes, some of which may be strong, a tornado watch is
anticipated within the next hour or two.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1200 PM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

miles west of Texarkana AR. For a complete depiction of the watch
see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU4).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.
