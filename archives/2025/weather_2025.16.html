Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0730 AM CDT Fri Apr 25 2025

Valid 251300Z - 261200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF
FAR EASTERN NM...THE TX PANHANDLE...WEST TEXAS AND SOUTHWEST OK...

...SUMMARY...
A concentrated area of severe thunderstorms is forecast over the
Texas South Plains and vicinity during the late afternoon and
evening. Large hail and localized wind damage appears likely.

...Synopsis...
Recent satellite imagery shows a cyclone west off the central West
Coast, with a shortwave trough progressing through its base into
southern CA. Upper ridging exists downstream from the southern
Plains through the northern Rockies while a low-amplitude shortwave
trough moves into the Lower OH Valley. A convectively enhanced
shortwave trough is also moving through the Lower MS Valley.

The southern CA shortwave is forecast to continue rotating around
the cyclone off the West Coast, moving through the Great Basin this
afternoon. The downstream ridging will shift eastward and build into
the Plains in response, while both the Lower OH Valley and Lower MS
Valley shortwaves progress eastward. Thunderstorm development is
anticipated across much of the OH and TN Valley as well as the Lower
MS Valley and Southeast ahead of these waves.

Early morning surface analysis places a low over in the TX/OK/NM
border intersection vicinity, with a dryline extending
west-southwestward across far southeast NM and far west TX. A cold
front also extends northeastward from this low to another low near
the MO/IL/IA border intersection. Strong to severe thunderstorms are
anticipated along the dryline across the TX Panhandle and West TX
this afternoon and evening.

...Far Eastern NM...TX Panhandle...West TX...
Recent surface observations already show dewpoints in the 60s across
much of far eastern NM, West TX and the TX Panhandle. Strong heating
is anticipated within this corridor today, to the south of a
slow-moving cold front and to the west of outflow from Thursday
night's thunderstorms. Upper ridging is expected to build across the
region, negating any large-scale ascent and placing the primary
impetus for convective initiation along the cold front, dryline, and
outflow boundary. Even so, convergence along this boundaries,
particularly the dryline and outflow should be enough for convective
initiation within the uncapped airmass. 

Mid-level flow may be a bit weaker than yesterday, but low-level
southeasterlies veering to southwesterly aloft should still result
in enough shear for updraft organization and supercells. Large to
very large hail will be the primary risk, but some localized tornado
threat could develop, particularly if a coherent outflow boundary
remains in place. Storm motion will be slow while storms are
discrete, but one or more forward-progressing clusters may evolve
over time, bringing the potential for strong gusts into northwest TX
and southwest OK.

...Lower MS Valley/Southeast into TN and OH Valley...
Widespread thunderstorm development is anticipated this afternoon as
the pair of shortwave troughs mentioned in the synopsis interact
with the moist and modestly buoyant airmass over the region.
Vertical shear will be weak, and a predominantly multicellular storm
mode is expected. This should limit the overall severe potential,
but a few damaging gusts are still possible.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0354 AM CDT Fri Apr 25 2025

Valid 281200Z - 031200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Day 4/Mon - Southern Plains to Upper Midwest...
A strong mid-level jet streak will move rapidly northeastward from
the Southwest to the Upper Midwest on Monday. As this occurs, a
surface low will deepen and move from the northern Plains to the
northern Great Lakes. Strong southwesterly lower tropospheric flow
will advect high theta-e air northward across the Midwest and into
parts of the Upper Midwest. Broken to scattered cloudcover will
support surface heating and strong destabilization across the warm
sector from southeast Minnesota and western Wisconsin to the
southern Plains. Isolated to scattered supercells are likely along
the dryline which will extend from the southern Plains and into
Kansas. 

The greatest focus for severe weather on Monday will be from eastern
Kansas into northern Missouri, much of Iowa and into southern
Minnesota and western Wisconsin. Moderate to strong instability,
strong shear, and increasing forcing for ascent supports the
potential for numerous rounds of severe thunderstorms. The wind
profile supports supercells capable of all severe weather hazards
including the potential for strong tornadoes. 

...Day 5/Tue - Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast...
The surface low associated with the Day 4 threat will continue
northeast and bring its associated cold front eastward across the
Midwest and Great Lakes through the day Tuesday. Moderate to strong
instability is forecast south of this front from northern New York
to the Ohio Valley. Much of the frontal zone should have sufficient
shear to support multiple storm clusters and the potential for a few
supercells. 

Day 6/Wed-Day8/Fri - Portions of the Mid-Mississippi Valley into the
Southeast...
A weaker mid-level shortwave trough is consistently depicted by
extended range guidance by the middle of next week across the
southern Plains. However, significant uncertainty remains about the
strength of this trough and location of any frontal zones. In
addition, convection across the southern Plains each day of the
extended range forecast could significantly impact destabilization
by Day 6-8. Therefore, confidence is not high enough to add
probabilities at this time, but they may eventually be needed
somewhere across the Southeast/Mid Mississippi Valley.

Mesoscale Discussion 0544
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0345 PM CDT Thu Apr 24 2025

Areas affected...eastern Colorado

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 242045Z - 242245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Some instances of severe hail and gusty winds possible
this afternoon/evening.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm activity is ongoing near and south of the
Denver metro this afternoon. Moisture in this region is limited,
with dew points in the upper 40s to 50s. Nonetheless, ongoing
convection will have potential to produce instances of mainly
sub-severe hail given steep lapse rates and cooling aloft. 

As this development and any additional development shifts further
south and east, it will enter a region with temperatures in the low
to mid 70s and dew points in the low to mid-50s near the CO/KS
border MLCAPE around 500-1000 J/kg and deep layer shear around 30-35
kts is observed in surface objective analysis as of 20z. This
environment may support some increase in coverage and intensity,
with better potential for severe hail and wind. Trends will be
monitored for potential watch issuance this evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 0543
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0233 PM CDT Thu Apr 24 2025

Areas affected...parts of cntrl and sern TX

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 241933Z - 242130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...A cluster of thunderstorms continues to organize, with
signs of increasing potential to produce strong to severe gusts
while propagating southeastward toward the mid/upper Texas coastal
plain through 5-7 PM CDT.

DISCUSSION...Forcing for ascent associated with
lower/mid-tropospheric warm advection, and southeasterly updraft
inflow of seasonably moist boundary-layer air (characterized by CAPE
in excess of 2000 J/Kg), have maintained vigorous thunderstorm
development.  Activity has undergone notable intensification and
increasing organization, and it appears that a meso-beta scale
cyclonic circulation is becoming better-defined near the Waco
vicinity, where a couple of 50+ kt surface gusts have recently been
observed.  

Despite continued gradual warming around 700 mb, and some suggestion
that the larger-scale forcing for ascent may weaken, the
boundary-layer ahead of the storms remains potentially supportive of
further intensification of the convective system, southeastward
toward the mid/upper Texas coastal plain into early evening. 
Deep-layer mean flow and shear remain generally modest, as does the
strength of the surface cold pool (as of 19Z observational data). 
However, with further strengthening of the mesoscale vortex and
west-northwesterly rear inflow, there remains potential for a
continued increase in risk for strong to severe gusts during the
next few hours.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 167
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
335 PM CDT Thu Apr 24 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Oklahoma Panhandle
  Texas Panhandle and South Plains

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 335 PM until
  1100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 4
    inches in diameter likely
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Widely scattered thunderstorms are forecast to rapidly
develop this afternoon into the early evening.  Environmental shear
and buoyancy combinations strongly favor intense, discrete
supercells.  Large to giant hail will be probable with any
supercell.  The tornado risk will likely focus for a few hours
during the early evening near a residual outflow boundary draped
over parts of the Watch area.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 60 statute miles
east and west of a line from 30 miles northeast of Guymon OK to 60
miles southeast of Lubbock TX. For a complete depiction of the watch
see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU7).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 166
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
255 PM CDT Thu Apr 24 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central into East Texas

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 255 PM until
  800 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A linear cluster of strong to severe thunderstorms will
likely continue east across much of the Watch area this afternoon
into the early evening.  Severe gusts 60-70 mph appear to be the
primary hazard, but large hail may accompany the stronger cells on
the southwestern flank of the thunderstorm band.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 50
statute miles north and south of a line from 35 miles west of Temple
TX to 25 miles east of Lufkin TX. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PARTS OF
THE TEXAS PANHANDLE AND CAPROCK...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS CENTRAL TO
EASTERN TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are forecast late this afternoon into
tonight across the southern High Plains.  Large to very large hail
is likely with the stronger storms.  A couple of tornadoes are
possible, in addition to isolated severe wind gusts.

...20z Update...
The primary change for this forecast update was the introduction of
15% wind probabilities (i.e. Slight risk) across portions of central
and eastern TX downstream of an intensifying MCS with a history of
measured severe gusts over the past couple of hours. A severe wind
threat is expected to persist into the evening hours before the MCS
gradually weakens late this evening/early overnight. See MCD #543
for additional details. Additionally, hail/wind risk probabilities
were removed across portions of north/northeast TX and eastern OK.
Latest RAP mesoanalysis estimates show a buoyancy minimum over the
region in the wake of the ongoing MCS. Air mass recovery appears
improbable given current cloud cover and observed temperature trends
within the residual cold pool. Recent CAM guidance supports this
idea and shows limited potential for additional robust convection
during the overnight hours. Elsewhere, the forecast remains on track
as outlined in the previous discussion below.

..Moore.. 04/24/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1139 AM CDT Thu Apr 24 2025/

...Southern/Central Plains...
Visible-satellite imagery shows a modifying outflow boundary draped
across the portions of the TX High Plains.  The 12z Del Rio raob
showed seasonably high boundary layer moisture (14.9 g/kg lowest
100-mb mean mixing ratio).  This upper-air raob sampled the moist
axis extending from the Rio Grande Valley northwestward through the
Permian Basin, South Plains, and into the Panhandle.  Water-vapor
imagery shows a weak disturbance currently moving east across
southern CO/northern NM.  The timing of this disturbance appears
favorably timed to influence thunderstorm development later this
afternoon/evening in the vicinity of the dryline.  

Strong heating beneath a capping inversion and a moistening boundary
layer will likely contribute to eroding CINH by mid afternoon. 
Forecast soundings show sufficient deep-layer westerly flow (25-kt
at 500 mb increasing to 80-kt at 200 mb) for organized storms.  Some
relatively backed low-level south-southeasterly flow will probably
be maintained east of the Caprock, aiding in some hodograph
enlargement.  Models show discrete storm development initially, with
some of this activity perhaps merging into a cluster towards the
evening over the eastern TX Panhandle/western OK vicinity.  Large to
giant hail is possible with the stronger supercells during the late
afternoon into the evening.  A couple of tornadoes are also possible
during a brief window of opportunity (23z-02z), in addition to the
risk for at least isolated severe gusts perhaps lingering tonight as
this activity spreads east.  

Farther north, isolated to widely scattered thunderstorms will
probably develop from parts of eastern CO (in a weak low-level
upslope flow regime) into the OK Panhandle and eventually southwest
KS.  A mixed mode of supercells and multicells should occur, with
large to very large hail possible with any slow-moving supercells. 
Severe/damaging winds may occur with any clusters that can develop
through the evening, although this threat may tend to remain fairly
isolated. 

Farther south, a midday thunderstorm cluster over central into
northeast TX will continue to migrate slowly eastward through the
afternoon.  Isolated damaging gusts and perhaps large hail will be
possible with this activity.  For short-term convective details,
refer to MCD #540.  

...Southeast Nebraska into Iowa...
A convectively augmented/low-amplitude shortwave trough will move
northeastward from parts of southeast NE into IA and vicinity today.
Although low-level moisture should remain fairly limited, it is
forecast to gradually increase along/south of a front by this
afternoon. Any thunderstorms that can develop and spread
northeastward could pose an isolated hail/wind threat given
sufficient deep-layer shear for updraft organization.

0237 PM CDT Thu Apr 24 2025

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

Slight modifications were made to the existing Elevated fire weather
threat area across portions of southeastern Arizona into New Mexico.
Residual outflow boundary moisture from convection expected this
afternoon across the Southern High Plains combined with
south-southeast flow should keep fire weather threat limited across
southeastern New Mexico. Therefore, Elevated highlights for Friday
were trimmed for this area.

..Williams/Lyons.. 04/24/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0127 AM CDT Thu Apr 24 2025/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will slowly advance eastward across the Southwest
while another mid-level trough amplifies over the Great Lakes
tomorrow (Friday). Surface cyclone development is possible across
portions of the Great Basin Friday afternoon, encouraging warm and
dry southerly flow across eastern Arizona into central and southern
New Mexico. Sustained 15-20 mph southerly surface winds will
coincide with 15 percent RH and overspread dry fuels for several
hours, warranting the introduction of Elevated highlights. 

Dry conditions will also persist across portions of the
Mid-Atlantic. While the surface wind field is expected to be too
weak on a widespread basis to justify Elevated highlights, locally
breezy conditions overspreading dry fuel beds will exacerbate any
localized wildfire-spread potential that exists.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF EASTERN NEW MEXICO AND ADJACENT WESTERN TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms are possible on Saturday
across portions of eastern New Mexico into western Texas.

...Discussion...
Convection is forecast to be ongoing across portions of the central
and southern Plains Saturday morning, near and north of a surface
baroclinic zone progged to lie roughly west-to-east western Texas
and Oklahoma to the Tennessee Valley.  With the upper pattern across
the western 2/3 of the U.S. to remain largely unchanged, with
ridging over the central U.S. and only very slow eastward
progression of the western U.S. upper low, the front should remain
roughly quasi-stationary Saturday.  This suggests potential for
storm redevelopment/reintensification during the afternoon, as
heating/destabilization maximize.  While background large-scale
subsidence should limit coverage of convection diurnally, a couple
of stronger storms capable of producing severe-caliber hail and/or
wind are expected.

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF OKLAHOMA...NORTHERN AND WESTERN TEXAS...AND FAR EASTERN NEW
MEXICO...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible across parts of Oklahoma,
northwest Texas, and extreme eastern New Mexico Friday afternoon and
evening.

...Synopsis...
An upper trough progressing east-southeastward across Ontario and
the Upper Great Lakes region Friday will support surface
cyclogenesis over the Lower Michigan area.  As the low
develops/shifts eastward with time, a surface cold front will
advance southeastward across the Ohio and Mid Mississippi Valleys,
and more slowly southward across the Oklahoma area.  

Meanwhile in the West, an upper low over the eastern Pacific will
deepen and shift southeastward, reaching the central California
Coast overnight.  In response, downstream ridging will amplify
across the central U.S. through the period.

...Southern Plains...
Convection may be ongoing at the start of the period across parts of
the Oklahoma/Kansas area, in the vicinity of the sagging cold front.
Despite ridging aloft, rather weak warm-sector capping should
support isolated to scattered storm redevelopment by afternoon,
particularly near the front as it shifts southward across Oklahoma
and the Texas Panhandle/South Plains through the day.  Moderate
afternoon destabilization, but modest shear, and large-scale
ridging, suggests only isolated severe risk -- mainly in the form of
hail and locally gusty/damaging winds.  Low-level jet development
expected during the evening over the High Plains may help sustain
convection through the overnight hours.

...Elsewhere...
Scattered thunderstorms -- and perhaps a couple of stronger storms
capable of producing gusty winds and small hail -- are expected
across parts of the Great Lakes/Midwest/Mid South region, near and
ahead of the aforementioned/advancing cold front.  Modest CAPE is
expected across the area, and with rather weak shear as well, any
severe risk would likely remain quite limited/local.

Scattered severe thunderstorms are forecast late this afternoon into
tonight across the southern High Plains.  Large to very large hail
is likely with the stronger storms.  A couple of tornadoes are

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1125 AM CDT Thu Apr 24 2025

Valid 241700Z - 251200Z

...Northeast New Mexico...
Downslope enhancement and drying off the Sangre De Cristo Mountains
should support a few hours of Elevated fire weather conditions
across portions of northeastern New Mexico this afternoon. Elevated
highlights were added to reflect expected breezy southwest winds
coupled with a very dry, well-mixed boundary layer supporting
afternoon relative humidity as low as 10 percent.

...Florida...
A steady east-southeast wind, relative humidity in the 30-40 percent
range this afternoon along with very dry fuels will continue to
support Elevated fire weather conditions across portions of the
western Florida Peninsula.

..Williams/Lyons.. 04/24/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0114 AM CDT Thu Apr 24 2025/

...Synopsis...
A low-amplitude mid-level trough will traverse New England and eject
into the Atlantic as another mid-level trough amplifies along the
West Coast today. Surface high pressure and overall cooler
temperatures will overspread much of the northern U.S. while broad
surface troughing and associated low-level moisture return becomes
established from the Great Plains to the East Coast. As such,
relatively quiescent fire weather conditions are expected over much
of the U.S. today. Dry conditions will persist across the Desert
Southwest, but surface wind fields should be too weak to necessitate
Elevated highlights. Some dry and breezy conditions are possible
across the western Florida Peninsula, where 30-40 percent RH will
overlap with 10-15 mph sustained southeasterly surface winds by
afternoon peak heating. Elevated highlights have been maintained in
this area given dry fuels.

Areas affected...Central and North Texas...Southern Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 241137Z - 241400Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A severe threat may continue across parts of central and
north Texas this morning. Isolated severe gusts and hail will be the
primary threats. The potential for weather watch issuance is low.

DISCUSSION...Mosaic radar imagery shows a line of strong
thunderstorms located from southern Oklahoma into north Texas, with
a linear cluster extending southward into central Texas. The storms
are located near a moist axis where surface dewpoints are in the mid
to upper 60s F. Across the moist airmass, the RAP is estimating
MLCAPE in the 1000 to 1500 J/kg range. The instability, combined
with large-scale ascent ahead of a shortwave trough and warm
advection are supporting the storms. In addition, the FWS WSR-88D
VWP has 0-6 km shear has 30 to 35 knots with some directional shear
in the low to mid-levels. This shear environment should be enough to
continue an isolated wind-damage and hail threat. The severe threat
may increase locally over the next hour or two, as the cells to the
south merge with the line to the north.

Areas affected...parts of wrn KS...sern CO...OK Pnhdl

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 231939Z - 232215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Intensifying thunderstorm development appears increasingly
probable through the 4-6 PM CDT time frame, including the potential
for supercells posing a risk for large hail and tornadoes in a
focused area near/southeast of Goodland.

DISCUSSION...With daytime heating and mixing, the boundary-layer
within surface troughing across the Texas/Oklahoma Panhandle
vicinity through western Kansas continues to deepen and destabilize.
It now appears generally characterized by surface temperature/dew
point spreads in excess of 30 F, with CAPE increasing to 1500-2000+
J/kg.

Inhibition is in the process of weakening, and deepening high-based
convection is now evident within the axis of stronger
destabilization.  With further insolation, the initiation of
thunderstorms appears increasingly probable, some of which may
eventually be accompanied by small hail and localized strong
downbursts.

Of greater concern is the potential for convective development where
better low-level moisture, on the western periphery of outflow
associated with persistent ongoing convection across central Kansas,
intersects the axis of stronger heating.  This appears focused near
a weak developing cyclonic circulation southeast of Goodland, where
shear associated with clockwise turning of low-level wind fields
with height, beneath a belt of 30 kt westerly flow around 500 mb, is
likely sufficient for supercells.  This is where potential for large
hail appears maximized, and near-surface CAPE/upward vertical
accelerations may promote the potential for tornadoes.

Areas affected...far southwestern Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 231914Z - 232115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Risk for gusty winds and large hail possible this
afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Deepening cumulus is observed across the Davis
Mountains and ahead of the surface dryline across far western Texas.
Temperatures have warmed into the upper 70s to 80s which has led to
weakening of MLCIN across the region. Convective initiation should
occur in the next 1-2 hours. Ahead of the dryline, MLCAPE around
1000-2000 J/kg  with deep layer shear around 35-40 kts. This will
support supercells capable of large hail (some very large) and

be needed in the coming hour.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 162
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
325 PM CDT Wed Apr 23 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southwest Texas

* Effective this Wednesday afternoon and evening from 325 PM
  until 1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 2.5 inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will intensify this afternoon over the Davis
Mountains and along a dryline and spread northeastward across the
watch area.  The strongest storms will pose a risk of large hail and
damaging wind gusts.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 55
statute miles east and west of a line from 25 miles northeast of
Wink TX to 40 miles southwest of Dryden TX. For a complete depiction
of the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS

0325 PM CDT Tue Apr 22 2025

Areas affected...portions of western Oklahoma...south-central Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 222025Z - 222230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Damaging wind and severe hail risk to increase through the
afternoon/evening.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm activity has initiated and expected to
continue to form along the dryline across the Texas Panhandle this
afternoon. Additional thunderstorm development is expected across
the frontal boundary draped across western/central Kansas into the
Oklahoma Panhandle. Ahead of this development, the air mass across
western Oklahoma into central/eastern Kansas has been suppressed
owing to weak forcing and stout MLCIN most of the afternoon.
Temperatures are warming, with MLCIN eroding west to east across the
Texas Panhandle as temperatures have climbed into the 80s. Aloft
sounding analysis indicates, steep lapse rates and ample CAPE above
the 850 mb inversion.

Thunderstorm activity will gradually shift into this region by late
afternoon/evening. A mix of multi-cell clusters and embedded
supercells capable of large hail and damaging wind are expected. A
watch will likely be needed in the coming hours to cover this risk.

Mesoscale Discussion 0516
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0217 PM CDT Tue Apr 22 2025

Areas affected...southwestern Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 221917Z - 222115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Damaging wind and hail risk to increase through the
afternoon/evening.

DISCUSSION...Surface analysis shows the dryline extending across the
Texas Panhandle into far eastern New Mexico and southward to the
Texas Big Bend as on 19z. Daytime heating under mostly sunny skies
has led temperatures to rise into the 80s (some mid to upper 80s
further south near the Mexico border). Satellite data shows towering
cu, mainly near and adjacent to the higher terrain of the Cap Rock
and Stockton Plateau. Morning observed soundings from AMA and LUB
would suggest that convective temperatures are around 80-85 F, which
in combination with increase in towering cu suggests initiation over
the next 1-2 hours. 

Initial development will likely be supercellular. Though flow aloft
and deep layer shear are more marginal, MLCAPE around 1500-2500 J/kg
and steep low to mid-level lapse rates will support potential for
large hail (some very large 2"+) and damaging wind. Where discrete
modes can interact with outflow/boundaries enhancing surface
vorticity, a tornado could be possible. As storms increase in
coverage this afternoon, clustering along outflows will tend to
create mixed mode of supercells and multi-cells, with an increase in
potential for damaging wind (some 70-80 mph). A watch will be needed
to cover these threats soon.

Mesoscale Discussion 0515
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0214 PM CDT Tue Apr 22 2025

Areas affected...the South Carolina and North Carolina Piedmont

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 221914Z - 222145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Widely scattered thunderstorm activity may continue to
gradually develop and strengthen through 5-7 PM EDT, accompanied by
at least some risk for marginally severe hail and potentially
damaging surface gusts.  This may remain fairly localized and a
severe weather watch is not anticipated, but trends will continue to
be monitored.

DISCUSSION...Widely scattered thunderstorm development appears
underway, perhaps supported by subtle mid-level cooling on the
northwestern periphery of deep-layer ridging centered off the south
Atlantic coast.  Based on forecast soundings, destabilization for a
modestly moist and warming boundary layer remains inhibited by weak
high-level lapse rates.  However, CAPE within the mixed-phase layer
might still be sufficient to support small to marginally severe
hail, aided by favorable shear beneath a 40 kt southwesterly jet
streak around 500 mb.  

Lower-level wind fields will remain more modest, but with at least
some further boundary-layer destabilization through peak daytime
heating, scattered thunderstorm activity will probably continue to
intensify.  And downward mixing of momentum may lead to a few
potentially damaging wind gusts, before storms weaken this evening.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0130 PM CDT Tue Apr 22 2025

Areas affected...parts of cntrl/sern LA...srn MS...swrn/cntrl AL

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 221830Z - 222130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A gradual increase in thunderstorm activity and intensity
appears probable through 4-6 PM CDT, with short-lived stronger
storms posing a risk for locally severe hail and wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...As low-amplitude mid-level troughing and more subtle
smaller-scale perturbations progress through weak (on the order of
10-20 kt) west-southwesterly mean flow across the Gulf Coast states,
associated forcing for ascent appears likely to contribute to
increasing thunderstorm development through 21-23Z.  Inhibition for
moist boundary-layer parcels (with dew points near 70F) is becoming 
increasingly negligible with continuing insolation, with modestly
steep lower/mid-tropospheric lapse rates contributing to CAPE around
1500-2000+ J/kg.  

Despite the rather modest to weak low-level and deep-layer shear,
thunderstorms are likely to continue to slowly intensify within the
destabilizing environment, into and beyond peak daytime heating. 
Stronger updraft pulses may eventually pose increasing potential to
produce severe hail and damaging downbursts.  As convection begins
to consolidate and become more widespread, this threat should
diminish, but strengthening convective outflow may continue to pose
potential for gusty/locally damaging winds into early evening.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 159
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
315 PM CDT Tue Apr 22 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  West Texas

* Effective this Tuesday afternoon and evening from 315 PM until
  1100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 75
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter likely
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will develop and increase in coverage
through the afternoon and evening across much of west Texas, in an
increasingly moist and unstable environment.  The strongest cells
are expected to produce large hail and damaging wind gusts.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 70
statute miles east and west of a line from 45 miles northeast of
Amarillo TX to 35 miles east of Dryden TX. For a complete depiction
of the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are

Mesoscale Discussion 0504
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0246 PM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

Areas affected...Northwest/north-central Arkansas into southern
Missouri

Concerning...Tornado Watch 154...

Valid 201946Z - 202115Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 154 continues.

SUMMARY...Storms moving into north-central Arkansas and southern
Missouri will pose a risk of tornadoes--some strong--and damaging
winds. There are signs of discrete storms within the line in
northwest/west-central Arkansas. These storms would bring the
greatest tornado risk.

DISCUSSION...KSRX radar imagery shows a few semi-discrete storms in
far western Arkansas. MRMS CAPPI data also shows these storms
intensifying. Mid-level ascent with southern extent will remain more
limited, but deep-layer shear vectors slightly more perpendicular to
the cold front will also favor discrete storms. VAD data from
KSGF/KLZK/KLSX all have shown an increase in low-level SRH over the
past couple of hours. This trend should continue, particularly in
Missouri. Supercell and QLCS tornadoes, some of which could be
strong, are all possible in this environment. Additionally, the more
linear convective elements will also pose a threat of wind damage.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 201920Z - 202115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A tornado watch will be forthcoming for portions of
eastern Missouri into western Illinois and far southeastern Iowa, as
a warm frontal boundary continues to lift northward out of central
Missouri.

DISCUSSION...Breaks in cloud cover, along with a northward-lifting
surface warm frontal boundary, have resulted in continued
destabilization across eastern Missouri into western Illinois. With
mixed-layer CAPE forecast to exceed 1000 J/kg in the presence of
strong wind shear (and strong curvature of the low-level hodograph
in the vicinity of the front), the tornado threat is expected to
increase this afternoon into the evening hours. 

Ongoing storms along the MO/KS/OK borders are forecast to continue
north and east into the new watch area, with supercells embedded
within a largely linear complex. Any embedded supercells (especially
any within the vicinity of the warm front), as well as any
pre-frontal storms, will have access to an environment characterized
by strong low-level shear/streamwise vorticity supportive of tornado
development. Current VAD wind profiles from KLSX show 200 m^2/s^2 of
0-500m storm relative helicity -- nearly double what is shown in the
current SPC Mesoanalysis. Given the environmental support for
tornadoes, some of which may be strong, a tornado watch is
anticipated within the next hour or two.

  PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Several tornadoes likely with a couple intense tornadoes
    possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Scattered large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A steady increase in coverage and intensity of
thunderstorms is expected to occur over the next several hours, with
severe-weather potential evolving from eastern Oklahoma and the
Arklatex region northward into Missouri.  Along with risk for fairly
widespread damaging wind gusts and hail, several tornadoes are
expected -- including potential for a few that are
strong/longer-lived.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 75 statute miles
east and west of a line from 45 miles north of Springfield MO to 25
miles west of Texarkana AR. For a complete depiction of the watch
see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU4).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.
