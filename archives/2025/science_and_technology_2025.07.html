is shutting down the AI Pin and selling its remnants to HP</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>Humane is selling most of its company to HP for $116 million and will
stop selling AI Pin, the company announced today. AI Pins that have
already been purchased will continue to function normally until 3PM ET
on February 28th, Humane says in a support document. After that date,
Pins will “no longer connect to Humane’s servers.” As a result, AI Pin
features will “no longer include calling, messaging, AI queries /
responses, or cloud access.” Humane is also encouraging users to
download any pictures, videos, and notes stored on their Pins before
they are permanently deleted at that shutdown time. ↫ Jay Peters at The
Verge I can’t think of a better example of “AI” being a planet-cooking
hype bubble than the Humane failure everybody saw coming from a mile
away. HP can add this useless acquisition next to the Palm one.</p>

<h2 id="arcaos-5.1.1-released">ArcaOS 5.1.1 released</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s been two years since the release of ArcaOS 5.1, which was a
hugely important release because it brought UEFI support to this
continuation of IBM’s OS/2, ensuring longevity for the project for years
to come. Since I don’t think much is known about what, exactly, Arca
Noae, and eComStation before it, has access to within the licensing
agreement with IBM, it’s difficult to ascertain just how much room they
actually have to make changes to the code at the core of the old OS/2.
Regardless, I tested ArcaOS 5.1 before and during its release, and the
support for UEFI and GPT partition layouts was excellent on my machines.
Almost 18 months later comes the next release in the 5.1 branch, ArcaOS
5.1.1, and as the version number implies, this isn’t another major
release on the scale of 5.1. Looking at the list of changes, it mostly
contains a ton of upgraded versions of various programs and tools
included in ArcaOS. After some digging into some of those upgraded
versions, I think I can safely say we’re looking at a ton of small
bugfixes, but there are also a few other things that stand out to me as
welcome changes. For instance, the changelog mentions various
improvements to the installer and related tools, such as an improved
method of determining the right screen resolution and font scaling
during the installation. Considering I had to deal with some issues
there – I think the installer UI elements were grossly oversized – this
is a welcome fix. There are also “refreshed” Firefox and Thunderbird
builds, although I don’t know if that means an update to the latest ESR
releases, or just a rebuild of what was already shipping with ArcaOS
5.1. I never found the time around the 5.1 release to do a proper review
– I was knee-deep in baby and toddler care overload at the time – but if
Arca Noae is willing to provide me with a 5.1.1 copy, I should be able
to actually review it now that I’m only ankle-deep in baby and toddler
care overload.</p>

<h2 id="unix-man-pages">UNIX man pages</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>What might be somewhat more surprising though considering its
research origins is that Unix almost since the very beginning had a
comprehensive set of online reference documentation for all its
commands, system calls, file formats, etc. These are the the manual- or
man-pages. On Unix systems used interactively, the man-pages have
historically always been installed, space permitting. The way the manual
pages have evolved and how they are used has changed over the decades.
This set of posts is intended to give people unfamiliar with them an
overview, as well as offer a review to seasoned users. ↫ Alex Bochannek
Right in this first article in the series there’s an interesting
observation I never stopped and thought about: because the original
creators of UNIX were writing the content of man pages with the very
tools they were creating for UNIX, it led to a virtuous cycle. “Unix
tools were used to document Unix, improving the documentation tools
themselves as well.” I tend to use the internet now to learn how
specific tools and commands work, but having such detailed man pages
built right into the operating system was a huge deal pre-internet.</p>

id="did-the-windows-95-setup-team-forget-that-ms-dos-can-do-graphics">Did
the Windows 95 setup team forget that MS-DOS can do graphics?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>One of the reactions to my discussion of why Windows 95 setup used
three operating systems (and oh there were many) was my explanation that
an MS-DOS based setup program would be text-mode. But c’mon, MS-DOS
could do graphics! Are you just a bunch of morons? Yes, MS-DOS could do
graphics, in the sense that it didn’t actively prevent you from doing
graphics. You were still responsible for everything yourself, though.
There were no graphics primitives aside from a BIOS call to plot a
single pixel. Everything else was on you, and you didn’t want to use the
BIOS call to plot pixels anyway because it was slow. If you wanted any
modicum of performance, you had to access the frame buffer directly. ↫
Raymond Chen And with everything the Windows 95 setup program needs that
you’d have to create, you’d end up just… Developing a custom operating
system in the first place. Since Microsoft already had Windows 3.x lying
around, why not reuse parts of that to aid in the Windows 95
installation process? Honestly, all of it makes perfect sense, and I
really don’t understand why anyone would seriously advocate for building
a separate, entirely custom operating system just to install Windows 95
when Windows 3.x was right there. Of course, these days things are a
little different, but Windows still loads a different operating system
during its installation. It’s called the Windows Preinstallation
Environment, but it’s no longer based on Windows 3.x, obviously, and
instead is a cut-down version of the Windows version you’re actually
installing. The latest version of Windows PE is 10.0.26100.1, and it’s
built from Windows 11 24H2. Windows PE also powers the Windows Recovery
Environment, the menu you can boot into to perform various analyses,
maintenance, and repair of your Windows installation. Since Microsoft
does not want Windows PE to be used a general purpose operating system,
it comes with a few interesting limitations you can’t really circumvent.
It has a non-configurable 72-hour time bomb, after which if will just
shut off, and since PE runs entirely in memory, no changes are saved –
unless you make any changes during the creation of the PE image. It also
makes use of FAT32, so there’s a whole host of limitations there, and
there’s a few other things Microsoft disabled. Since you an add drivers
to a PE image, though, I wonder if you could sneak in a file system
driver and circumvent FAT32’s limitations that way?</p>
