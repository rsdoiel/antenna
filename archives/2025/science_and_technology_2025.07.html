<h2 id="illumos-on-sparc-possible-but-problematic">Illumos on SPARC:
possible, but problematic</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>While SPARC may no longer be supported by the main Illumos project,
it still works and is still viable. This page brings together a variety
of information regarding Illumos on SPARC, not necessarily limited to
Tribblix. ↫ Tribblix website It seems running Tribblix – and other
Illumos-based distributions – on SPARC is still possible, but there are
some serious limitations anyone who has tried to use even slightly older
operating systems will be fairly familiar with. For instance, since
there’s no Rust for Illumos on SPARC, Firefox and other applications
that use it are not available, and Tribblix in particular no longer
builds Pale Moon (or LibreOffice). Rust is available on Solaris 11,
though, so it may be possible to bring it to Illumos. In a similar vein,
Go also isn’t available for SPARC either. As far as hardware support
goes, it’s a bit of a mixed bag, as systems that should work do, in
fact, not, and even systems that do work run into a very familiar
problem: graphics card support is a big issue. This is a problem
plaguing X.org on any outdated or sidelined architecture, and it seems
Illumos is also affected. Obviously, this greatly reduces the usefulness
of Illumos on workstations, but is less of an issue on servers. You’ll
run into the same problem when trying to run NetBSD, OpenBSD, or Linux
in, say, PA-RISC hardware. Of course, the problem is both a lack of
people interested in and capable of contributing to keeping stuff
running on older architectures, further spurred on by a dwindling supply
of hardware available at reasonable prices. Sad, but there isn’t much
that can be done about it.</p>

<h2 id="flathub-safety-a-layered-approach-from-source-to-user">Flathub
safety: a layered approach from source to user</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>About two weeks ago we talked about why Fedora manages its own
Flatpak repository, and why that sometimes leads to problems with
upstream projects. Most recently, Fedora’s own OBS Flatpak was broken,
leading to legal threats from the OBS project, demanding Fedora remove
any and all branding from its OBS Flatpak. In response, Fedora’s
outgoing project leader Matthew Miller gave an interview on YouTube to
Brodie Robertson, in which Miller made some contentious claims about a
supposed lack of quality control, security, and safety checks in
Flathub. These claims led to a storm of criticism directed at Miller,
and since I follow quite a few people actively involved in the Flatpak
and Flathub projects – despite my personal preference for traditional
Linux packaging – I knew the criticism was warranted. As a more official
response, Cassidy James Blaede penned an overview of all the steps
Flathub takes and the processes it has in place to ensure the quality,
security, and safety of Flathub and its packages. With thousands of apps
and billions of downloads, Flathub has a responsibility to help ensure
the safety of our millions of active users. We take this responsibility
very seriously with a layered, in-depth approach including sandboxing,
permissions, transparency, policy, human review, automation,
reproducibility, auditability, verification, and user interface. Apps
and updates can be fairly quickly published to Flathub, but behind the
scenes each one takes a long journey full of safety nets to get from a
developer’s source code to being used on someone’s device. While
information about this process is available between various
documentation pages and the Flathub source code, I thought it could be
helpful to share a comprehensive look at that journey all in one place.
↫ Cassidy James Blaede Flathub implements a fairly rigorous set of
tests, both manual and automated, on every submission. There’s too many
to mention, but reading through the article, I’m sure most of you will
be surprised by just how solid and encompassing the processes are. There
are a few applications from major, trusted sources – think applications
from someone like Mozilla – who have their own comprehensive
infrastructure and testing routines, but other than those few, Flathub
performs extensive testing on all submissions. I’m not a particular fan
of Flatpak for a variety of reasons, but I prefer to stick to facts and
issues I verifiably experience when dealing with Flatpaks. I was
definitely a bit taken aback by the callousness with which such a
long-time, successful Fedora project leader like Miller threw Flathub
under the bus, but at least one of the outcomes of all this is greater
awareness of the steps Flathub takes to ensure the quality, security,
and safety of the packages it hosts. Nothing is and will be perfect, and
I’m sure issues will occasionally arise, but it definitely seems like
Flathub has its ducks in a row.</p>

<h2 id="microsoft-is-paywalling-features-in-notepad-and-paint">Microsoft
is paywalling features in Notepad and Paint</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>There’s some bad news for Windows users who want to use all of the
built-in features of the operating system and its integrated apps. Going
forward, Microsoft is restricting features in two iconic apps, which
you’ll need to unlock with a paid subscription. The two apps in
question? Notepad and Paint. Windows Insiders were previously able to
use these app features free of charge. However, Microsoft is now making
it necessary to have a Microsoft 365 subscription for full use of these
apps. You’ll see a new overlay that informs you of this before use. In
our case, however, the respective features were simply grayed out. ↫
Laura Pippig at PCWorld It’s only the “AI” features that are being
paywalled here, so I doubt many people will care. What does feel
unpleasent, though, is that the features are visible but greyed out,
instead of being absent entirely until you log into Windows with an
account that has a Microsogt 365 subscription with the “AI” stuff
enabled. Now it just feels like the operating system you paid good money
for – and yes, you do actually pay for Windows – is incomplete and
badgering you for in-app purchases. The gameification of Windows
continues. There’s also a y in the day, so we have another Ars Technica
article detailing the long list of steps you need to take to make
Windows suck just a little less. The article is long, and seems to grow
longer every time Ars, or any other site for that matter, posts an
updated version. I installed Windows 11 on my XPS 13 9370 a few weeks
ago to see just how bad things had gotten, and the amount of work I had
to do to make Windows 11 even remotely usable was insane. Even the
installation alone – including all the updates – took several hours,
compared to a full installation of, say, Fedora KDE, which, including
updated, takes like 10 minutes to install on the same machine. I
personally used WinScript to make the process of unfucking Windows 11
less cumbersome, and I can heartedly recommend it to anyone else forced
to use Windows 11. Luckily for me, a brand new laptop is being delivered
today, without an operating system preinstalled. Can’t wait to install
Fedora KDE and be good to go in like 20 minutes after unboxing the
thing.</p>

<h2 id="chromium-ozonewayland-the-last-mile-stretch">Chromium
Ozone/Wayland: the last mile stretch</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>Lets start with some context, the project consists of implementing,
shipping and maintaining native Wayland support in the Chromium project.
Our team at Igalia has been leading the effort since it was first merged
upstream back in 2016. For more historical context, there are a few blog
posts and this amazing talk, by my colleagues Antonio Gomes and Max
Ihlenfeldt, presented at last year’s Web Engines Hackfest. Especially
due to the Lacros project, progresses on Linux Desktop has been slower
over the last few years. Fortunately, the scenario changed since last
year, when a new sponsor came up and made it possible to address most of
the outstanding missing features and issues required to move Ozone
Wayland to the finish line. ↫ Nick Yamane There still quite a bit of
work left to do, but a lot of progress has been made. As usual, Nvidia
setups are problematic, which is a recurring theme for pretty much
anything Wayland-related. Aside from the usual Nvidia problems, a lot of
work has been done on improving and fixing fractional scaling, adding
support for the text-input-v3 protocol, reimplementing tab dragging
using the proper Wayland protocol, and a lot more. They’re also working
on session management, which is very welcome for Chrome/Chromium users
as it will allow the browser to remember window positions properly
between restarts. Work is also being done to get Chromium’s interactive
UI tests infrastructure and code working with Wayland compositors, with
a focus on GNOME/Mutter – no word on KDE’s Kwin, though. I hope they get
the last wrinkles worked out quick. The most popular browser needs to
support Wayland out of the box.</p>

<p>There’s a number of backups of old DECtapes from Dennis Ritchie,
which he gave to Warren Toomey in 1997. The tapes were eventually
uploaded, and through analysis performed by Yufeng Gao, a lot of
additional details, code, and software were recovered from them. A few
days ago, Gao came back with the results from their analys of two more
tapes, and on it, they found something quite special. Getting this
recovered version to run was a bit of a challenge, and only aap’s PDP-11
emulator is capable of running it. To even get it to run in the first
place, Gao had perform quite some intricate steps, but eventually he
managed to build an image that can be downloaded and booted on aap’s
PDP-11 emulator. The image in question, as well as some more details,
can be found on the GitHub page.</p>

once again confirms it’s all about ads and “AI” now</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>We’ve recognized that Mozilla faces major headwinds in terms of both
financial growth and mission impact. While Firefox remains the core of
what we do, we also need to take steps to diversify: investing in
privacy-respecting advertising to grow new revenue in the near term;
developing trustworthy, open source AI to ensure technical and product
relevance in the mid term; and creating online fundraising campaigns
that will draw a bigger circle of supporters over the long run.
Mozilla’s impact and survival depend on us simultaneously strengthening
Firefox AND finding new sources of revenue AND manifesting our mission
in fresh ways. That is why we’re working hard on all of these fronts. ↫
Mark Surman on the Mozilla blog None of this is new to anyone reading
OSNews. I’ve been quite vocal about Mozilla’s troubles and how it
intends to address those troubles, and I’m incredibly worried and
concerned about the increasing efforts by Mozilla to push advertising
and “AI” to somehow find more revenue streams. I think this is the wrong
direction to take, and will not make up for the seemingly inevitable
loss of the Google search deal – and my biggest fear is that Firefox
will get a lot worse before Mozilla realises advertising and “AI” just
aren’t compatible with their mission and the morals and values of the
last few remaining Firefox users. I don’t have any answers either, of
course. Making a competitive browser is hard, and clearly requires a lot
of people and a lot of time. Donations are fickle, nobody will pay for a
browser, and relying on corporate sponsoring in other forms than the
Google search deal will just mean Firefox will become like Chrome even
faster, with more and more exceptions for “allowed” ads and additional
roadblocks for adblockers to try and work around. In essence, I strongly
believe that it is impossible to both earn money from online ads and
make a good browser. It’s one or the other – not both. There’s basically
no competition in the browser space, and if we lose Firefox, the only
other option is Chrome and its various skins. Not a future I’m looking
forward to.</p>

<h2 id="the-generative-ai-con">The generative AI con</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>Everywhere you look, the media is telling you that OpenAI and their
ilk are the future, that they’re building “advanced artificial
intelligence” that can take “human-like actions,” but when you look at
any of this shit for more than two seconds it’s abundantly clear that it
absolutely isn’t and absolutely can’t. Despite the hype, the marketing,
the tens of thousands of media articles, the trillions of dollars in
market capitalization, none of this feels real, or at least real enough
to sustain this miserable, specious bubble. People like Marc Benioff
claiming that “today’s CEOs are the last to manage all-human workforces”
are doing so to pump up their stocks rather than build anything
approaching a real product. These men are constantly lying as a means of
sustaining hype, never actually discussing the products they sell in the
year 2025, because then they’d have to say “what if a chatbot, a thing
you already have, was more expensive?” ↫ Edward Zitron Looking at the
data and numbers, as Zitron did for this article, the conclusions are
sobering and harsh for anyone still pushing the “AI” bubble. Products
aren’t really getting any better, they’re not making any money because
very few people are paying for them, conversion rates are abysmal, the
reported user numbers don’t add up, the projections from “AI” companies
are batshit insane, new products they’re releasing are shit, and the
media are eating it up because they stand to benefit from the empty
promises. Generative AI is a financial, ecological and social time bomb,
and I believe that it’s fundamentally damaging the relationship between
the tech industry and society, while also shining a glaring, blinding
light on the disconnection between the powerful and regular people. The
fact that Sam Altman can ship such mediocre software and get more
coverage and attention than every meaningful scientific breakthrough of
the last five years combined is a sign that our society is sick, our
media is broken, and that the tech industry thinks we’re all fucking
morons. This entire bubble has been inflated by hype, and by outright
lies by people like Sam Altman and Dario Amodei, their lies perpetuated
by a tech media that’s incapable of writing down what’s happening in
front of their faces. Altman and Amodei are raising billions and burning
our planet based on the idea that their mediocre cloud software products
will somehow wake up and automate our entire lives. ↫ Edward Zitron In a
just world, these 21st century snake oil salesmen would be in
prison.</p>

TSMC weigh possible Intel deals that would split storied chip maker</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>Broadcom has been closely examining Intel’s chip-design and marketing
business, according to people familiar with the matter. It has
informally discussed with its advisers making a bid but would likely
only do so if it finds a partner for Intel’s manufacturing business, the
people said.  Nothing has been submitted to Intel, the people cautioned,
and Broadcom could decide not to seek a deal.  Separately, TSMC has
studied controlling some or all of Intel’s chip plants, potentially as
part of an investor consortium or other structure, according to people
familiar with the discussions. ↫ Asa Fitch, Lauren Thomas, and Yang Jie
at The WSJ The vultures continue to circle, but considering Intel isn’t
actually dead yet, it does all feel a little bit premature. The company
needs time to right the ship, but with its current non-technical,
finance-oriented leadership it might already be too late for such time
to be given to the company. For all we know, they’re already working on
a big payday through divestment or wholesale selling of the company, and
they’re just waiting on the right offer. I don’t think it’s a good idea
to let Intel be stripped for parts and looted by the ultra-wealthy, but
with the United States hurdling towards a massive constitutional crisis
and experiencing utter destruction of government institutions, I don’t
think anyone’s left to stop it or think things through properly.</p>

already been purchased will continue to function normally until 3PM ET

Pins will “no longer connect to Humane’s servers.” As a result, AI Pin
features will “no longer include calling, messaging, AI queries /
responses, or cloud access.” Humane is also encouraging users to
download any pictures, videos, and notes stored on their Pins before
they are permanently deleted at that shutdown time. ↫ Jay Peters at The

<h2 id="arcaos-5.1.1-released">ArcaOS 5.1.1 released</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s been two years since the release of ArcaOS 5.1, which was a
hugely important release because it brought UEFI support to this
continuation of IBM’s OS/2, ensuring longevity for the project for years
to come. Since I don’t think much is known about what, exactly, Arca
Noae, and eComStation before it, has access to within the licensing
agreement with IBM, it’s difficult to ascertain just how much room they
actually have to make changes to the code at the core of the old OS/2.
Regardless, I tested ArcaOS 5.1 before and during its release, and the
support for UEFI and GPT partition layouts was excellent on my machines.
Almost 18 months later comes the next release in the 5.1 branch, ArcaOS
5.1.1, and as the version number implies, this isn’t another major
release on the scale of 5.1. Looking at the list of changes, it mostly
contains a ton of upgraded versions of various programs and tools
included in ArcaOS. After some digging into some of those upgraded
versions, I think I can safely say we’re looking at a ton of small
bugfixes, but there are also a few other things that stand out to me as
welcome changes. For instance, the changelog mentions various
improvements to the installer and related tools, such as an improved
method of determining the right screen resolution and font scaling
during the installation. Considering I had to deal with some issues
there – I think the installer UI elements were grossly oversized – this
is a welcome fix. There are also “refreshed” Firefox and Thunderbird
builds, although I don’t know if that means an update to the latest ESR
releases, or just a rebuild of what was already shipping with ArcaOS
5.1. I never found the time around the 5.1 release to do a proper review
– I was knee-deep in baby and toddler care overload at the time – but if
Arca Noae is willing to provide me with a 5.1.1 copy, I should be able
to actually review it now that I’m only ankle-deep in baby and toddler
care overload.</p>

<h2 id="unix-man-pages">UNIX man pages</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>What might be somewhat more surprising though considering its
research origins is that Unix almost since the very beginning had a
comprehensive set of online reference documentation for all its
commands, system calls, file formats, etc. These are the the manual- or
man-pages. On Unix systems used interactively, the man-pages have
historically always been installed, space permitting. The way the manual
pages have evolved and how they are used has changed over the decades.
This set of posts is intended to give people unfamiliar with them an
overview, as well as offer a review to seasoned users. ↫ Alex Bochannek
Right in this first article in the series there’s an interesting
observation I never stopped and thought about: because the original
creators of UNIX were writing the content of man pages with the very
tools they were creating for UNIX, it led to a virtuous cycle. “Unix
tools were used to document Unix, improving the documentation tools
themselves as well.” I tend to use the internet now to learn how
specific tools and commands work, but having such detailed man pages
built right into the operating system was a huge deal pre-internet.</p>

id="did-the-windows-95-setup-team-forget-that-ms-dos-can-do-graphics">Did
the Windows 95 setup team forget that MS-DOS can do graphics?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>One of the reactions to my discussion of why Windows 95 setup used
three operating systems (and oh there were many) was my explanation that
an MS-DOS based setup program would be text-mode. But c’mon, MS-DOS
could do graphics! Are you just a bunch of morons? Yes, MS-DOS could do
graphics, in the sense that it didn’t actively prevent you from doing
graphics. You were still responsible for everything yourself, though.
There were no graphics primitives aside from a BIOS call to plot a
single pixel. Everything else was on you, and you didn’t want to use the
BIOS call to plot pixels anyway because it was slow. If you wanted any
modicum of performance, you had to access the frame buffer directly. ↫
Raymond Chen And with everything the Windows 95 setup program needs that
you’d have to create, you’d end up just… Developing a custom operating
system in the first place. Since Microsoft already had Windows 3.x lying
around, why not reuse parts of that to aid in the Windows 95
installation process? Honestly, all of it makes perfect sense, and I
really don’t understand why anyone would seriously advocate for building
a separate, entirely custom operating system just to install Windows 95
when Windows 3.x was right there. Of course, these days things are a
little different, but Windows still loads a different operating system
during its installation. It’s called the Windows Preinstallation
Environment, but it’s no longer based on Windows 3.x, obviously, and
instead is a cut-down version of the Windows version you’re actually
installing. The latest version of Windows PE is 10.0.26100.1, and it’s
built from Windows 11 24H2. Windows PE also powers the Windows Recovery
Environment, the menu you can boot into to perform various analyses,
maintenance, and repair of your Windows installation. Since Microsoft
does not want Windows PE to be used a general purpose operating system,
it comes with a few interesting limitations you can’t really circumvent.
It has a non-configurable 72-hour time bomb, after which if will just
shut off, and since PE runs entirely in memory, no changes are saved –
unless you make any changes during the creation of the PE image. It also
makes use of FAT32, so there’s a whole host of limitations there, and
there’s a few other things Microsoft disabled. Since you an add drivers
to a PE image, though, I wonder if you could sneak in a file system
driver and circumvent FAT32’s limitations that way?</p>
