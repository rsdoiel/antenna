## Investigating the relationship between cycle threshold of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, clinical features, and laboratory data in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Semnan, Iran

date: 2025-03-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionCOVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has emerged as a global public health crisis. Understanding the factors associated with disease severity and outcomes is crucial for effective patient management. This study aimed to investigate the association between cycle threshold (CT) values, demographic data, medical history, clinical manifestations, and laboratory findings in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Semnan, Iran.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted on 86 patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to two hospitals in Semnan, Iran, between December 2022 and March 2023. Respiratory swab samples were collected RT-PCR was performed, CT values were obtained, and data were collected from medical records, including demographic information, medical history, clinical manifestations, and laboratory results. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software.ResultsThe study included 86 COVID-19 patients, with a slightly higher representation of females (55.8%) and a mean age of 67.43 years. Pre-existing conditions like hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and ischemic heart disease were prevalent among hospitalized patients. A majority of patients (59.3%) had severe COVID-19, as indicated by lower CT values, while 31.4% exhibited oxygen saturation levels below 90%. Significant differences were observed in FBS, CRP, WBC, Hb, Cr, and SPo2 levels between severe and non-severe patients. Correlation analysis revealed associations between age, CRP, Cr, BUN, FBS, Vitamin D, TG, LDL, HDL, AST, ALP, and SPo2. Reflecting complex interactions between inflammatory markers, organ function, and lipid metabolism in COVID-19 patients.ConclusionThis study provides valuable insights into the association between CT values, clinical characteristics, and laboratory findings in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The findings underscore the importance of CT values in assessing disease severity and potential prognostication. Further research is warranted to validate these findings in larger and more diverse patient populations.

## Gut microbiome differences and disease risk in colorectal cancer relatives and healthy individuals

date: 2025-03-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Given the heightened focus on high-risk populations, this study aimed to provide insights into early susceptibility and preventive strategies for colorectal cancer (CRC) by focusing on high-risk populations. In this research, fecal samples from 1,647 individuals across three discovery cohorts and nine external validation cohorts were sequenced using whole-genome metagenomic sequencing. A prediction model based on random forest was constructed using the nine external cohorts and independently validated with the three discovery cohorts. A disease probability (POD) model based on microbial biomarkers was developed to assess CRC risk. We found that the gut microbiome composition of CRC relatives differed from that of controls, with enrichment of species such as Fusobacterium and Bacteroides and a reduction in beneficial genera like Coprococcus and Roseburia. Additionally, dietary red meat intake emerged as a risk factor. The POD model indicated an elevated risk of CRC in unaffected relatives. The findings suggest that the POD for CRC may be increased in unaffected relatives or individuals living in shared environments, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. Our study introduces a novel framework for assessing the risk of colorectal cancer in ostensibly healthy individuals.

## Factors affecting dysbiosis of the gut microbiota in the elderly and the progress of interventions in traditional Chinese and Western medicine

date: 2025-03-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

As the population ages, intestinal health in the elderly has become a key area of concern, with gut microbiota dysbiosis emerging as a significant issue. This review summarizes the factors influencing dysbiosis and interventions from both traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine, offering a reference for future research. A comprehensive search of global databases up to March 2024 identified 617 original studies on gut microbiota dysbiosis in individuals aged 65 and older. After applying strict PRISMA guidelines, 20 articles met the inclusion criteria. Key findings are summarized in four areas: 1) the definition and mechanisms of dysbiosis, 2) evaluation tools for gut microbiota imbalance, 3) factors contributing to dysbiosis in the elderly, and 4) pharmacological treatments. Both TCM and Western medicine offer unique advantages in managing gut microbiota dysbiosis, and the choice of intervention should be tailored to the individualâ€™s condition. Future research should focus on optimizing integrated TCM and Western medicine approaches to improve outcomes for elderly patients with gut microbiota dysbiosis.
