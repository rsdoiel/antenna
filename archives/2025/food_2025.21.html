<h2 id="spiced-beef">SPICED BEEF</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-26, from: Irish Food Hub</p>
<p>
Description: Spiced Beef is a festive and flavorful delicacy from Cork,
traditionally enjoyed during Christmas but cherished year-round. The
beef is cured in a mixture of spices‚Äîlike cloves, allspice, black
pepper, and sugar‚Äîthen slow-cooked until tender. It‚Äôs usually served
cold, thinly sliced, and paired with crusty bread or mustard.
Preparation Time: 20 minutes (plus 5‚Äì7 days curing time)Cooking Time:
3‚Äì4 hoursServing Size: Serves 8-10 Ingredients: For the Cure: 4‚Äì5 lb
(2‚Äì2.5 kg) beef brisket (flat cut, well-trimmed) ¬Ω cup brown sugar ¬Ω cup
coarse sea salt 1 tbsp cracked black pepper 1 tbsp whole allspice 1 tbsp
whole cloves 1 tbsp juniper berries (optional) 1 tsp ground cinnamon 1
tsp ground nutmeg 1 tsp ground ginger 4 garlic cloves, crushed 1 bay
leaf, crumbled For Cooking: 1 onion, quartered 1 carrot, chopped 1
celery stalk, chopped Water to cover Instructions Prepare the Spice
Mix:In a bowl, mix all the curing ingredients together. Rub and Cure:Rub
the spice mixture thoroughly all over the beef. Place in a large ziplock
bag or non-metallic dish, cover, and refrigerate for 5 to 7 days. Turn
the beef daily to ensure even curing. Rinse and Simmer:After curing,
rinse the beef under cold water to remove excess spices. Place in a
large pot with onion, carrot, and celery. Cover with water and bring to
a boil. Skim any foam, then reduce to a gentle simmer. Cook
Slowly:Simmer the beef for 3 to 4 hours until tender. You can use a slow
cooker on low for 8 hours as an alternative. Cool and Slice:Let the beef
cool in the broth. Once cooled, wrap and refrigerate until firm. Slice
thinly and serve cold. Serving Suggestions: Serve with crusty brown
bread, mustard, or pickles. Excellent in sandwiches or as part of a
festive cold meat platter.
