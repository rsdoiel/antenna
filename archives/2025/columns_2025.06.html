<p>As soon as President Donald Trump took office, his administration
froze great swaths of government funding, apparently to test the theory
popular with Project 2025 authors that the 1974 law forbidding the
president from ‚Äúimpounding‚Äù money Congress had appropriated was
unconstitutional.</p>

At some point soon we‚Äôre going to have to stop business as usual.
Remember when we realized Covid was deadly and we‚Äôd have to radically
change our lives to survive? Most of us did that. We‚Äôre going to do that
soon re the overthrow of our government and looting of the economy.

<p>
It was remarkable watching the SuperBowl last night, you could conclude
everything is normal. It‚Äôs not. We‚Äôre going to have to start shutting
down all the services we can to make the point to our fellow citizens
that we, the United States, are not coming back from this without major
change.

<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
First, that‚Äôs just a theory, but I need to get your attention.
</p>
<p>
Rooting a computer means you own it. You have superuser powers. You can
do anything, install or uninstall anything.
</p>
<p>
Mostly journalism has been reporting ‚ÄúHe has our social security
numbers.‚Äù Sigh. That‚Äôs not nearly the problem folks.
</p>
<p>
With root access on the financial computers of the US, you can delete
debt. Trump
<a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-suggests-us-may-have-less-debt-than-thought-because-fraud">threatened</a>
to do that last night, in a really menacing way. They are smart fellows
those guys.
</p>
<p>
You want to destroy the world economy? Start deleting records of debt to
the US treasury. Ask an economist if you don‚Äôt believe me.
</p>
<p>
More likely is they want to hold the world economy hostage, and then
they will take their demands of Gaza and Canada more seriously. It‚Äôs
clever because it doesn‚Äôt require soldiers, not one shot will be fired.
My guess is that they already have this power.
</p>
<p>
BTW, here‚Äôs SQL code that randomly deletes 1 in 5 records in a table
named inventory.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>delete from inventory where rand () &lt; 0.2;</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Run that command on the debt of the United States, and voila, the
greatest depression ever.
</p>
<p>
You don‚Äôt have to be a math wiz to come up with that, btw. You can
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67aa0be8-91f0-8012-987f-89d8b8edba21">ask
ChatGPT</a>. And before you blame ChatGPT this would be an early
exercise in a textbook on SQL programming.
</p>
<p>
Deleting the debt would be like trying to withdraw money from your
account at a bank and them saying they have no record of you having an
account. The US treasury is basically the root bank of the entire world
economy. It‚Äôs where people store their money.

I buy tea about once a year. I also buy a lot of coffee but I have never
compared the two. Probably a mistake. At one point I weighed the coffee
beans for my Mokka pot and got 17g. I make two of these per day. That‚Äôs
about 12.5kg per year and probably costs CHF 250.- per year, plus coffee

<p>
Here‚Äôs an <a href="https://ksze.github.io/PeerAuth/">easy</a> system for
two humans to remotely authenticate to each other, so they can be sure
that neither are digital impersonations.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
To mitigate that risk, I have developed this simple solution where you
can setup a unique time-based one-time passcode (TOTP) between any pair
of persons.
</p>
<p>
This is how it works:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Two people, Person A and Person B, sit in front of the same computer and
open this page;
<li>
They input their respective names (e.g.¬†Alice and Bob) onto the same
page, and click ‚ÄúGenerate‚Äù;
<li>
The page will generate two TOTP QR codes, one for Alice and one for Bob;

<a href="https://sfstandard.com/2025/02/08/aaron-swartz-marble-statue-unveiled-internet-archive/">yesterday</a>
to test the fix. I knew Aaron of course, he was part of the group
developing <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> in
the early 00s. He went on to do other things, as did I, and I met up
with him again in NYC in the early teens, and then a few months or a
year or two (I don‚Äôt have the exact date of the meetup) he commited

It was a tragedy, because an older more confident Aaron would have made
