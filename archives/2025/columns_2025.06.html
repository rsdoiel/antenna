<p>Here’s a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2-Xbn92mXE">two-minute
demo</a> of my new writing tool for Bluesky. This is quite a bit simpler
than the last version, you log on directly to Bluesky, doesn’t go
through my server at all. This removes a whole layer of complexity for
the user, and means a lot of people can use it without it having to
scale up. Also made it simpler, more of a writing tool, closer to where
I’d like this stuff to be when we have across-the-board textcasting
support. Really focused on the flow for writers.</p>

because I never use it. Added Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads. Debated
whether to remove Twitter, but it is still a way to follow my posts, the
ones that go out through the linkblog. A lot of people still use
Twitter. Had to include the latest version of Font-Awesome, but since my
story pages don’t otherwise use FA, I figured nothing could break. Haha.

2025-02-07 I bought some tea
</h1>
<p>
I buy tea about once a year. I also buy a lot of coffee but I have never
compared the two. Probably a mistake. At one point I weighed the coffee
beans for my Mokka pot and got 17g. I make two of these per day. That’s
about 12.5kg per year and probably costs CHF 250.- per year, plus coffee
in coffee houses and restaurants.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, taking pictures of the labels with my phone, relying on the
optical character recognition so I can copy and paste this into
<a class="account" href="https://social.tchncs.de/@babelcarp" title="@babelcarp@social.tchncs.de"><span

<a href="http://www.panix.com/~perin/babelcarp/">Babel Carp</a>, “a
Chinese Tea Lexicon”, and reading the entriss is how I also spend extra
time with the tea.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Ye Lai Xiang (50g / CHF 41.50),
<a href="https://www.panix.com/~perin/babelcarp/babelcarp.cgi?phrase=%E5%87%A4%E5%87%B0%E5%8D%95%E4%B8%9B&amp;define=1">凤凰单丛</a>,
Phoenix Single Bush, descended from Shuixian trees growing in
Fenghuanshan, i.e., the Phoenix Mountains in Chao An, called 夜来香 or
Nocturnal Fragrance, maybe due to roasting over lychee wood (although
last time I bought it wasn’t nearly as strong as I remembered I still
want back that lychee fragrance)
</li>
<li>
Ya Shi Xiang Dong Pian (50g / CHF 55.00), another 凤凰单丛, this one
being
<a href="https://www.panix.com/~perin/babelcarp/babelcarp.cgi?phrase=%E9%B8%AD%E5%B1%8E%E9%A6%99%E5%86%AC%E7%89%87&amp;define=1">鸭屎香冬片</a>
or “Smells Like Duck Shit” – this is confusing! – from Taiwan
</li>
<li>
Gang Kou Cha Meer Oolong (100g / CHF 55.00),
<a href="http://www.panix.com/~perin/babelcarp/babelcarp.cgi?phrase=%E6%B8%AF%E5%8F%A3%E8%8C%B6&amp;define=1">港口茶</a>,
harbour tea from Pingtung in Taiwan
</li>

Jinggu 2016 ( 357g / CHF 180.00),
<a href="https://www.panix.com/~perin/babelcarp/babelcarp.cgi?phrase=%E6%99%AE%E6%B4%B1%E7%94%9F%E9%A5%BC%E5%8F%A4%E6%A0%91%E8%8C%B6&amp;define=1">普洱生饼古树茶</a>,
Pu Er Shen Bing Gu Shu Cha, i.e., raw Pu Er from old trees in 景谷,
Jinggu; this one is the cheapest I could get, being neither from the
east nor west of the Mekong river from from further north; they had
cakes from 2015 up to 2024, all at the same price, and I didn’t know
which ones to pick so I picked an older one – was this a good choice?
</li>
<li>
Jin Jiang Hui Ming (50g / CHF 40.00),
<a href="https://www.panix.com/~perin/babelcarp/babelcarp.cgi?phrase=%E9%87%91%E5%A5%96%E6%83%A0%E6%98%8E&amp;define=1">金奖惠明</a>,
green tea grown by the She Zu; it got a gold medal in 1915! 😄 Huiming
is the name of a local temple
</li>
<li>
Tama Ryokucha Hinpyoukai (50g / CHF 35.00), kept under shade for three
weeks, giving it a gyokuro sencha touch, From Ureshino, Saga. This is
the Tsuyuhikari plant variety.
</li>
<li>
Gen Mai Bancha (125g / CHF 17.50)
</li>
<li>
Hojicha (70g / CHF 13.50)
</li>
<li>
Shincha Yame (100g / CHF 40.00)
</li>
<li>
Sencha Hoshino (50g / CHF 42.50)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Some everyday tea like Genmaicha and Hojicha; some Sencha; some green
tea from China, and a Pu Er cake. I am an absolutely clueless buyer of
tea and essentially I just know that my price range goes up to around
CHF 60.-/50g.

<p>
Nevertheless, in my hubris I wrote
<a href="2024-10-22-chinese-tea">preparing Chinese tea for

one go, so I wrote what I thought was important to me when I got started

<p>date: 2025-02-13, updated: 2025-02-14, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
In the span of just weeks, the US government has experienced what may be
the most consequential security breach in its history—not through a
sophisticated cyberattack or an act of foreign espionage, but through
official orders by a billionaire with a poorly defined government role.
And the implications for national security are profound.
</p>
<p>
First, it was reported that people associated with the newly created
Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) had

<p>This morning Wired published This Ad-Tech Company Is Powering
Surveillance of US Military Personnel. It’s a good piece, which is
typical of Wired lately. But what caught my eye was “Ad-Tech” in the
headline. Some writers say “ad tech.” Others say “adtech” or “AdTech.”
I’m highly leveraged in “adtech,” since I’ve now posted 160 pieces

<h2 id="the-united-states-is-not-a-silicon-valley-company">The United
States is not a Silicon Valley company</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I’ve had an experience few people have had, and it’s relevant to the way
all of us feel right now. The experience: Being part of a Silicon Valley
company that was acquired by another Silicon Valley company. I was the
CEO.
</p>
<p>
I recognize the feeling, because Musk is acting as if he is the acquirer
of a Silicon Valley company, and the company he has acquired in the USA.
Or so he thinks. But the United States is not a Silicon Valley company
where, you have departments and managers at every level, and each level
must follow orders from the level above them. It doesn’t work that way
here. Deliberately. Very deliberately.
</p>
<p>
There never has been a Silicon Valley company that gives each employee
the rights and responsibilities of an American citizen. We don’t take
orders except in very exceptional circumstances, and then with all the
rights guaranteed by the Constitution. That’s why Musk and Trump are
having so much trouble coming to grips with how this place works,
because even the employees of the USA are voters and taxpayers and have
rights that must be respected. That <i>will</i> be respected or all hell
will break loose.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, back to Silicon Valley acquisitions. Up to the point when you,
the former CEO, are now a VP, and must take orders from the CEO, you
didn’t have to take orders from anyone, not even your board of
directors. The CEO of the tech company is a lot like a citizen of the
US, until they aren’t a CEO any longer and have to do the bidding of the
actual CEO (which is who Musk thinks he is relative to the USA). This is
why even MAGAs who love Trump (or really the idea of Trump) aren’t going
to put up with his bullshit. American citizens, rich or poor, old or
young, LBGTQ or whatever – we all are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state">sovereign</a>,
ie we don’t have to take orders from anyone, not even a supposed genius
like Musk (sorry, but I am free to doubt his genius, something might
take some getting used to by him). We don’t take orders from him, or
anyone else, except of course, as mentioned earlier under very special
circumstances.
</p>
<p>
Back to the disconnect in the Mind of Musk. Now you’re supposed to sit
here, quietly, while he rips apart the team you carefully built, the
people you formed into a family with all its strengths and dysfunction.
The new CEO (Musk) sweeps in with no idea what they’re fucking with, and
they don’t want to hear about it. Finally you have to quit after a short
time because you can’t be part of the disaster they’re creating. And
always is a disaster, and sometimes they can dig out of it as he has
done with Twitter, as we’ve seen many SV companies have. But again, for
the 18th time, <i>the United States of America is not a Silicon Valley
company.</i>
</p>
<p>
What triggered it for me was the story about how Musk didn’t know he had
terminated all cancer research being done by the US. Surrounded by yes
men, they never would have told him. And he didn’t want to hear it from
a founder (like a congressperson or the head of the NIH or the acting
Treasury secretary). This is going to be repeated over and over until
the acquirer writes off the investment or who knows. His experience
comes from acquiring Tesla and Twitter, which while they were large
organizations are nothing compared with the United States.
</p>
<p>
And ultimately the United States is going to chew up Musk and spit him
out. We may be very damaged by the experience, but he will come out much
worse than the country. Because we are not who he thinks we are.
</p>

Here’s a

and then registered, abandoned Amazon S3 buckets for about $400. These
buckets contained software libraries that are still used. Presumably the
projects don’t realize that they have been abandoned, and still ping
them for patches, updates, and etc.

The TL;DR is that this time, we ended up discovering ~150 Amazon S3
buckets that had previously been used across commercial and open source
software products, governments, and infrastructure deployment/update
pipelines—and then abandoned…

politicians in technology backwaters to opportunists and fashion
billionaires, everyone has jumped on the “AI” version of Shinkansen. And

I’ll get to that testing at a later date, but one thing I enjoy in my
testing is finding what 3D accelerated games and other applications can
be run on alternative architectures. With the great work from Wine and
Proton over the years, a great many games run out of the box on
Linux—and they can be made to run on Arm and RISC-V architectures with
almost as much ease as Linux on X86/AMD64!

<h2 id="trump-and-trudeau-chat">Trump and Trudeau chat</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
First, the
<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/191367/trump-treasury-default-bond-market">New
Republic</a> is beginning to think like Musk and Trump. But they have to
think a bit more and ask how does this all tie together?
</p>
<p>
Remember you have to consider events that would normally be unthinkable.
And believe that Trump isn’t actually president of the United States in
any sense of what that meant in the past. He is sitting in the seat of
the president. He has the powers of the president, but he does not
represent the interests of the United States.
</p>
<p>
He’s going to use the US Treasury and the power of the dollar as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#:~:text=A%20reserve%20currency%20is%20a,of%20their%20foreign%20exchange%20reserves.">reserve
currency</a>, to buy himself a few toys to play with, like Canada,
Greenland, Gaza and Panama, to start.
</p>
<p>
To illustrate, here’s the text of an imaginary conversation between
Trump and Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Trump: Hey Justin, how’s it going?
</li>
<li>
Trudeau: You know, not so good.
</li>
<li>
Trump: I get it. Have you considered my offer?
</li>
<li>
Trudeau: Yes. Either we surrender and become the 51st state, or you
won’t honor Canadian deposits in the US Treasury.
</li>
<li>
Trump: That’s right my friend.
</li>
<li>
Trudeau: I don’t see how we have any choice.
</li>
<li>
Trump: I’m afraid that’s correct.
</li>
<li>
Trudeau: Semi-sarcastic: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United
States of America and Canada.
</li>
<li>
Trump: You can leave out the Canada part.
</li>
<li>
Trudeau: You can’t blame me for trying.
</li>
<li>
Trump: Have a nice day. 😀
</li>
</ul>
<p>
And then this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4nYgfV2oJA&t=130s">scene from
Goodfellas</a> demonstrates what’s next for the former independent
country of Canada.

At some point soon we’re going to have to stop business as usual.
Remember when we realized Covid was deadly and we’d have to radically
change our lives to survive? Most of us did that. We’re going to do that
soon re the overthrow of our government and looting of the economy.
</p>
<p>
It was remarkable watching the SuperBowl last night, you could conclude
everything is normal. It’s not. We’re going to have to start shutting
down all the services we can to make the point to our fellow citizens
that we, the United States, are not coming back from this without major
change.

<h2 id="musk-roots-the-world-economy">Musk roots the world economy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
First, that’s just a theory, but I need to get your attention.
</p>
<p>
Rooting a computer means you own it. You have superuser powers. You can
do anything, install or uninstall anything.
</p>
<p>
Mostly journalism has been reporting “He has our social security
numbers.” Sigh. That’s not nearly the problem folks.
</p>
<p>
With root access on the financial computers of the US, you can delete
debt. Trump
<a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-suggests-us-may-have-less-debt-than-thought-because-fraud">threatened</a>
to do that last night, in a really menacing way. They are smart fellows
those guys.
</p>
<p>
You want to destroy the world economy? Start deleting records of debt to
the US treasury. Ask an economist if you don’t believe me.
</p>
<p>
More likely is they want to hold the world economy hostage, and then
they will take their demands of Gaza and Canada more seriously. It’s
clever because it doesn’t require soldiers, not one shot will be fired.
My guess is that they already have this power.
</p>
<p>
BTW, here’s SQL code that randomly deletes 1 in 5 records in a table
named inventory.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>delete from inventory where rand () &lt; 0.2;</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Run that command on the debt of the United States, and voila, the
greatest depression ever.
</p>
<p>
You don’t have to be a math wiz to come up with that, btw. You can
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67aa0be8-91f0-8012-987f-89d8b8edba21">ask
ChatGPT</a>. And before you blame ChatGPT this would be an early
exercise in a textbook on SQL programming.
</p>
<p>
Deleting the debt would be like trying to withdraw money from your
account at a bank and them saying they have no record of you having an
account. The US treasury is basically the root bank of the entire world
economy. It’s where people store their money.

<p>date: 2025-02-10, updated: 2025-02-10, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Here’s an <a href="https://ksze.github.io/PeerAuth/">easy</a> system for
two humans to remotely authenticate to each other, so they can be sure
that neither are digital impersonations.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
To mitigate that risk, I have developed this simple solution where you
can setup a unique time-based one-time passcode (TOTP) between any pair
of persons.
</p>
<p>
This is how it works:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Two people, Person A and Person B, sit in front of the same computer and
open this page;
<li>
They input their respective names (e.g. Alice and Bob) onto the same
page, and click “Generate”;
<li>
The page will generate two TOTP QR codes, one for Alice and one for Bob;
…
</li>
</li>

<a href="https://sfstandard.com/2025/02/08/aaron-swartz-marble-statue-unveiled-internet-archive/">yesterday</a>
to test the fix. I knew Aaron of course, he was part of the group
developing <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> in
the early 00s. He went on to do other things, as did I, and I met up
with him again in NYC in the early teens, and then a few months or a
year or two (I don’t have the exact date of the meetup) he commited
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/technology/aaron-swartz-internet-activist-dies-at-26.html">suicide</a>.
It was a real shock. Now, many years later – a statue. And the
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/aa1a8beacf79d90bc26105ba46c32072">random
snarky slogan</a> my test script picked out was really
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/02/09/aaronScreenshot.png">appropriate</a>
to the
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bighugga.bsky.social/post/3lhqslgshmt2c">event</a>.
It was a tragedy, because an older more confident Aaron would have made
a big contribution. I often think about that.</p>

<h1 id="2025-02-06-discord-for-role-playing-games">
2025-02-06 Discord for role-playing games
</h1>
<p>
Discord really works well for my gaming. I even pay them. 😬 And as far
as finding new players goes: essentially there are some generic servers,
some servers for particular games or publishers, and for your tables. So
you “look for games” in the first two category of servers and then you
send interested parties an invite to the server for your table(s).
</p>
<p>
It’s a bit weird but it works for me.
</p>
<p>
I don’t use Discord as a chat or forum in the first two kinds of
servers. Way too many people and crazy amount of text flying by! But on
those small gaming table server? 🥰
</p>
<p>
I just look the other way when they ask me about my activities shat they
can share what music I listen to and what games I play. No way!
</p>
<p>
One thing that Discord does better than IRC is help handle the dizzying
amount of channels per server (i.e. per publisher, rule set or gaming
table); their specific rules; their independent admins; their roles;
their selective visibility: channels for certain roles only, for certain
people only, group chat (ephemeral private channels); their local bots
and automations; media uploads; muting for channels and servers, for
certain time periods only or until you reverse your decision. All of
this is great.
</p>
<p>
Yes, you can self-host an IRC server and a web frontend like The Lounge
(which I do) and you can get close: many channels, but all are equal:
there is no formal grouping, no independent moderation, no independent
roles, no independent bots. It’s all one big soup. And if you add some
rules via nickserv and chanserv, it might get you all the way but is
still quite arcane. What a difference Discord makes. Plus effortless
voice chat. 🥰
</p>
<p>
Yes, voice chat and video chat, on top of all that.
</p>
<p>
Now, you might think: what a shill! But really: I self-host the
inferior-but-free options. I write my bot to connect to both (!) IRC and
Discord and free content from the black void that is the endless Discord
archives. But I also want things to just work. My time is more precious
than the €10 (?) I spend every month. And I had to take down Jitsi
because it was too resource intensive. The alternative would have been
to upgrade my lousy server and spend more time sysadminning and I don’t
want to.
</p>
<p>
So self-hosted IRC has voice and video only if I leech Jitsi from
somebody else, as far as I am concerned.
</p>
<p>
So I don’t know where to go from here. I just pay them for the service.
And I look the other way when they disallow other clients. 😓
</p>
<p>
But then again: I used Bitlbee for a long time. I even wrote a plugin
that lets you connect to your fedi instance as if it was an IRC server
and another kind soul wrote a plugin that does the same for Discord. And
then you start to realize how unusable this is. I’m on maybe two dozen
servers? My account has access to 200+ channels, all of the active, all
of them need some sort of mapping to IRC channels? It’s hell.
Notifications were out of control. I stopped doing it. So: is Discord
shit, or the IRC clients? I don’t know. But I know that Discord is not
all bad. It’s definitely not bad as an idea of how to organize a
gazillion people.
</p>
<p>
But I do look the other way when I think about tracking and AI training
and data brokering.🖕I don’t even know if they do it but these are the
days of zero trust and fucking corpo greed maggot CEOs so it doesn’t
really matter what they do specifically because I don’t trust any
company to do the right thing. Maybe I’d trust them if they were a
non-profit association.
</p>
<p>
Anyway. Just putting this out there because with Discord I’m playing
three or four times a week and I only don’t play more because I do want
to get out every now and then. 😆

<a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="Sandra">@Sandra</span></a> makes a good
counter argument:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Oh, I disagree 100% with the idea that Discord is good. Proprietary
infrastructure with network externalities is the unending nightmare we
live in. No matter how technically “good” it gets, it’s bad. Actually
the “better” it gets, the worse that is because it makes it harder to
replace it.
</p>
<p>
Not that I agree that Discord is technically “good”.
</p>
<p>
The “per-server organization” is part of the frustration since I can get
pinged and spammed and bothered in channels I don’t even want just
because I read other channels on that server.
</p>
<p>
Akkoma’s dev team runs an IRC server of their own and they have a couple
of different channels for different things, but thanks to the
life-changing magic of IRC actually having its own hackable apps it’s
easy on the client end to sort that all out with filters and scriptable
rules etc, even merge channels on the user end.
</p>
<p>
The fact that running mapping apps between Discord and IRC is clunky and
difficult and ToS-breaking is another strike against Discord, not for
it.

</h1>
<p>
Grossdemonstrationen ohne Folgen, selbst die Grünen in Deutschland auf
ausländerfeindlichem Kurs, wie weiter? Gute Frage.
</p>
<p>
Ich glaube, es braucht immer noch Politiker und Pokitikerinnen, die eine
Partei im Rücken haben. Es braucht Leute, die das Potential nutzen
können und charismatisch genug sind, damit das kleinkarierte
Gegeneinander keine Rolle spielt. Revolutionen fangen auch mit vielen
Versammlungen und Demos an.
</p>
<p>
Der Plan ist, dass sich jemand die Demos zunutze macht, weil es ohne
Personen, die vorne stehen, nicht geht – so mein Schluss aus dem Occupy
Wallstreet, dass sich im Sand verläuft. Da von den bestehenden Parteien
niemand hierfür in der Lage zu sein scheint, gibt es nur die Optionen,
weiter zu demonstrieren und zu schauen, ob aus der Masse
Führungspersönlichkeiten hervorstechen. So tröste ich mich zumindest
über den aktuellen Rechtsrutsch und die Taubheit der Politik hinweg.
</p>
<p>
Klar sind „Führungspersönlichkeiten“ und „Parteien“ keine coolen
Begriffe. Was ist mit Anarcho-Syndikalismus? Was ist mit der Abschaffung
des Kapitalismus?
</p>
<p>
Leider ist mir trotz mehr als hundert Folgen Revolutions Podcast hören
kein gutes Beispiel eingefallen, wo das gut gelaufen ist. Aber immer
waren Organisationen dahinter. Auch Martin Luther King hat organisiert,
demonstriert, Reden gehalten.
</p>
<p>
Deswegen bin ich noch nicht bereit, die parlamentarische Demokratie
unter den Bus zu werfen. Das kann auf alle Fälle besser funktionieren.
Vermögenssteuer, Kapitalgewinnsteuer, Erbschaftsteuer,
Kapitalfluchtverhinderung, Spendenlimiten, Gesetzesreferenden,
Verfassungsinitiativen (ich lebe in der Schweiz), bedingungsloses
Grundeinkommen, da geht noch einiges. Und Pegida-Märsche haben gezeigt,
dass mit Ausdauer schon was zu erreichen ist. Die Rechtspopulisten hier
(SVP) haben mit ihrem “Bauernfrühstück” gezeigt, wie Basisarbeit gehen
kann. Das einzige, was mir klar ist, ist, dass weiter wie bisher nicht
geht. Und wenn wir den Staat destabilisieren, dann drohen Invasion,
Warlordism und andere Failed State Varianten. Nichts tolles, auf alle
Fälle.

The <i>Washington Post</i> is
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/">reporting</a>
that the UK government has served Apple with a “technical capability
notice” as defined by the 2016 Investigatory Powers Act, requiring it to
break the Advanced Data Protection encryption in iCloud for the benefit
of law enforcement.
</p>
<p>
This is a big deal, and something we in the security community have
worried was coming for a while now.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The law, known by critics as the Snoopers’ Charter, makes it a criminal
offense to reveal that the government has even made such a demand. An
Apple spokesman declined to comment…

<a href="http://scripting.com/2021/11/19/140204.html?title=myNewTesla">after</a>
3+ years, which is amazing. But the other day it updated, and gave me a
pause, if they let Musk hack their computers the way he’s hacking ours,
should I trust what it installs on the vehicle I drive every day that
theoretically has the ability to take control of my car and drive it off
the road? I wonder if the people at Tesla would like to reassure people
who drive their cars that the updates are safe from hacking by one of
his associates? How is security on the Tesla network?</p>

  alt="Photograph of a baby board book entitled ‘Goodnight Stories for Rebel Girls: Baby’s First Book of Extraordinary Women’. The font of the main part of the title is whimsically cursive, while the subtitle is in all caps in a thick, more comic book-style font. The cover illustrations are space-themed, with a dark starry sky for a background, and clip art-style images of a rocket, a moon and a planet. In the top-left quadrant there’s also a baby mobile with a megaphone, a star, a hand making a ‘rock out’ gesture, a lightning bolt, and a love heart dangling from it. The colour theme is blue (dark and light), red (with some pink), yellow and white."

<p>
When I was teaching, I’d sometimes see older girls reading the non-baby
book version of this, so I was like, “Oh yeah. Rebellion is the kind of
spirit I want to inculcate early.” I knew it wasn’t exactly going to be
Marxist propaganda, but <em>man</em> have I been disappointed. I mean,
if by “rebel” you mean “woman who played the game and became a
resounding success by the parameters of the system she lived in” then
sure, it’s full of rebel women. There are loads of QUEENS, for example.
I’m sorry, but if you’re the QUEEN, you are RUNNING the system, you are
not REBELLING AGAINST IT. If you’re going to insist on the existence of
“rebel queens”, at least include Queen Lili‘uokalani of Hawaii, who
tried (and failed) to resist the forcible takeover of her country by the
United States. I guess you could argue that Cleopatra did the same thing
against the Romans (and she <em>is</em> in the book), but her page
doesn’t say, “Powerful and wise, Cleopatra seduced two Roman leaders to
try to convince them to lay off Egypt.” It says, “Powerful and wise, she
ruled ancient Egypt.” How is she a rebel for RULING Egypt? Come on,
people.
</p>
<p>
Beyond actual monarchs, there are also a number of women who are there
just for becoming prominent in their fields, be that science,
environmentalism, sports, the arts… I’ve got nothing against Marie Curie
or Jane Austen, but again, this feels like a very liberal view of
“rebellion” that doesn’t meaningfully challenge the system at all. Frida
Kahlo is there, but only for her paintings – at no point does it mention
she was a revolutionary socialist who helped to shelter Trotsky from
Stalin’s goons (and had an affair with him, of course, but this is a
children’s book). The book does have <em>some</em> genuine activists who
totally deserve to be there, like Rosa Parks, Malala Yousafzai and Manal
al-Sharif, and I’m not familiar with every single person in the book so
maybe some are just suffering from misleading descriptions, like Frida
Kahlo does. Like, maybe the woman who’s in there for “planting trees”
actually engaged in direct action to prevent wide-scale deforestation,
or something. Probably not, but I don’t know. Maybe. (Update: I am
pleased to report that the woman who’s in there for “planting trees”,
Wangari Maathai, actually was a persistent thorn in the side of the
Kenyan government, to the point that at one stage they planned to
assassinate her. So let’s add her to the column of “rebels who totally
deserve to be in the book, but got bad descriptions”.)
</p>
<p>
But there are definitely some in there who make me roll my eyes, like
Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Viv didn’t believe me that they’d actually claim a
Supreme Court judge was a “rebel”, so I had to show him, and mockingly
read the description: “She asked tough questions, like ‘why’ and ‘how’…”
</p>
<p>
“What right-wingers made this book?!” he cried.
</p>
<p>
“I know, right,” I replied. “Where’s Leila Khaled?”
</p>
<p>
(For what it’s worth, I’ve been telling people
<abbr title="In Real Life">IRL</abbr> my feelings on this book including
relaying this conversation, and not one of them has got the Leila Khaled
reference. And I’ve just been like… you know… this
person?!<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>

<p>
Am I crazy? Is she not as famous as I think she is? And I mean, no, I
don’t actually want my daughter to grow up to hijack planes, but if
we’re talking about “rebel girls”, Leila Khaled is certainly closer to
the mark than a fucking Supreme Court judge…)
</p>
<p>
I just feel like there’ve been so many women in history who are so much
more deserving of being a “goodnight story for rebel girls”. I regularly
see social media posts about heroic women who joined the Resistance and
took out Nazis during <abbr title="World War Two">WW2</abbr>, for
example. If we want to continue the theme of radical women in famous
photos, there’s

centring a 17-year-old Marina Ginestà i Coloma (and actually, in one of
those historical coincidences, that same page says it was an “old flame”
of hers who moved to Moscow and became the assassin who killed Trotsky.
Marina herself, though, was glad never to have got sucked into the orbit
of Moscow). There are so many prominent female revolutionaries:
communists like Rosa Luxemburg, anarchists like Emma Goldman, Black
liberationists like Angela Davis and Assata Shakur. If you REALLY want
to include women who became the leaders of countries, you could at least
look to Latin American presidents like Michelle Bachelet or Dilma
Rousseff who survived torture at the hands of despotic right-wing
regimes. My partner would insist that Winnie Mandela deserves a place,
even though that’s another controversial choice. I feel bad that I don’t
really know enough about Asian and African history to throw out more
suggestions but I’m sure there are innumerable candidates. There may
even be some good candidates from before the twentieth century, but I
think you can see what the bulk of my studies concentrated on, haha.
</p>
<p>
The point is, they could’ve done so much better. Some may say I’m
expecting a bit much politically from a book whose target audience is
literally babies. Some may further say that a book of revolutionary
propaganda for babies is unlikely to find a publisher. All of this is
true. However, I am entitled to my high standards. If they just hadn’t
gone for the “rebel girls” terminology, and instead been like “…for
high-achieving girls” or “…for girls with big dreams” I don’t think it’d
have annoyed me so much. But to be an inspiration to “rebel girls”
you’ve got to actually, you know, <em>rebel</em>. Only a minority of
women in the book ever did that.

Indie has reached another milestone: her first cold 😑

<p>
And yeah, it’s summer. As far as I can tell it IS just a cold though,
because Viv and I (who are also sick) both did 3-in-1 Covid/RSV/flu
tests, and were negative to everything. And it doesn’t seem severe. It’s
all brand new to Indie, though…
