<p>At this year’s Oscars, <em>Anora</em> filmmaker Sean Baker made history by personally receiving 4 Academy Award wins for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Editing. Only Warren Beatty, Alan Menken, Alfonso Cuaron and Chloe Zhao had achieved the record 4 nominations for a single film before him. And while the film’s success has introduced Baker to his biggest audience yet, he’s been steadily releasing independent films about misfits, immigrants and sex workers on the margins of American society for 25 years. Here are the 7 films that paved the way to <em>Anora</em>.&nbsp;<br><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0259255/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_four%2520letter%2520words" style="font-weight: bold;"></a></p>

date: 2025-03-03, from: Locus Magazine

<p>In my new novel <strong>Picks and Shovels</strong>, we learn the origins of Martin Hench, my bestselling, two-fisted, scambusting forensic accountant who debuted in 2023’s <strong>Red Team Blues </strong>and whose adventures continued in 2024’s <strong>The Bezzle</strong>.</p>
<p>Marty’s origin story starts at MIT in 1982, where he joins the proud lineage of computer science students who flunk out of their degrees because they’re too busy hacking code to do their  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/03/commentary-cory-doctorow-there-were-always-enshittifiers/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

date: 2025-03-02, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Juice</strong>, Tim Winton (Picador 978-1-76134-489-3, AUD$45.00, 528pp, hc) October 2024. Cover by Adam Laszczuk.</p>
<p>Here’s an admission that would elicit a gasp from the Australian literary elite: I have never read a Tim Winton novel. Worse, I read the opening of one of his most famous novels and I hated it. But then I read <strong>Juice. </strong>And if all his novels hit like that for people who like realism&#8230;  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/03/juice-by-tim-winton-review-by-alexandra-pierce/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
