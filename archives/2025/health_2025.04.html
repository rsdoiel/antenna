and limitations in using bacterial metabolites as immunomodulators</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Harnessing the immunomodulatory potential of bacterial metabolites
opens up exciting possibilities for treating various immune-related
disorders. However, turning this potential into a reality presents
significant challenges. This review investigates these challenges,
focusing on discovery, production, characterization, stability,
formulation, safety, and individual variability limitations. The limited
bioavailability of many metabolites, as well as potential improvements
along with the potential for off-target effects and the importance of
precise targeting, are emphasized. Furthermore, the complex interactions
between gut bacterial metabolites and the microbiome are investigated,
highlighting the importance of personalized approaches. We conclude by
discussing promising advances in metagenomics, metabolomics, synthetic
biology, and targeted delivery systems, which hold out hope for
overcoming these limitations and paving the way for the clinical
translation of bacterial metabolites as effective immunomodulators.</p>

comprehensive analysis of the uterine microbiome in endometrial cancer
patients - identification of Anaerococcus as a potential biomarker and
carcinogenic cofactor</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionEndometrial cancer (EC) is a significant gynecological
malignancy with increasing incidence worldwide. Emerging evidence
highlights the role of the uterine microbiome in the pathogenesis of EC.
This study aims to characterize the uterine microbiome in EC patients
and identify potential microbial biomarkers, with a focus on
Anaerococcus as a differentiating taxon.MethodsThe endocervical canal
swabs from patients with EC (n=16) and non-cancerous patients (EM, n=13)
were collected. The V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced
using the Illumina platform. Bioinformatic analyses were performed with
QIIME2, and statistical comparisons were conducted to assess differences
in microbial composition and diversity. In vitro experiments were
conducted to assess the functional impact of Anaerococcus on human
uterine fibroblasts, including its ability to adhere to the human cells
and induce oxidative stress.ResultsThe α-diversity metrics, including
Shannon entropy and observed amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), revealed
significantly higher microbial diversity in EC samples compared to EM.
Anaerococcus was identified as a key taxon differentiating EC from EM
groups, showing a higher relative abundance in EC samples. Functional
predictions and in vitro assays indicated that Anaerococcus may
contribute to carcinogenesis by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production, and has the high ability to adhere to the human endometrial
fibroblasts.DiscussionThe study provides evidence of distinct microbial
signatures in EC, with Anaerococcus emerging as a potential biomarker.
The in vitro findings suggest its role in endometrial carcinogenesis,
underscoring its potential as a target for future diagnostic and
therapeutic applications.</p>

transmission of a SARS-CoV-2 variant detected by wastewater surveillance
in Panama</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the critical role of viral genomic
surveillance, prompting numerous countries to enhance their monitoring
systems for acute respiratory infections (ARIs), especially
influenza-like illnesses (ILIs). Given the significance of asymptomatic
cases in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
transmission, cases often undetected by the ILI surveillance, a more
comprehensive approach was essential to track the circulation of
SARS-CoV-2 variants in the population. In response, many countries
swiftly adopted wastewater surveillance, which allowed the early
detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants before they were identified through
molecular characterization from confirmed clinical cases. In this
report, we detail the implementation of SARS-CoV-2 wastewater genomic
surveillance in Panama during the first half of 2024. Wastewater samples
were collected monthly in duplicate at two collection points from three
districts of Panama city metropolitan area for testing by SARS-CoV-2
RT-qPCR, and positive samples were analyzed by next-generation
sequencing to identify sublineages. A total of 36 wastewater samples and
822 samples obtained through the clinical surveillance were analyzed for
molecular detection and sequencing. Sublineages detected by wastewater
surveillance were compared to those detected by clinical surveillance
for the same period of time. Wastewater surveillance allowed the
identification of the Omicron sublineage JN.1.16.1 in the capital city
and its surroundings, which was not detected by the clinical
surveillance in the country, despite its global circulation. This
highlights the critical need to sustain both genomic surveillance
programs beyond the pandemic in countries like Panama that serve as
pivotal exchange hubs.</p>

from the respiratory microbiota modulate inflammatory responses and
associate with a reduced pneumococcal burden in the lungs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundCertain species from the normal respiratory tract
microbiota have recently been proposed to positively influence human
health. Corynebacterium propinquum and C. pseudodiphtheriticum
(Corynebacteria) are two Gram-positive species that frequently colonize
the upper respiratory tract and strongly associate with a reduced
incidence of respiratory tract infections. The specific role of
Corynebacteria during respiratory health and disease is, however,
largely uncharacterized.MethodRespiratory tract epithelial cells
NCI-H292 and BALB/cByJ mice were inoculated with Corynebacteria (C.
propinquum 2018M3 and 2019M4, and C. pseudodiphtheriticum 2019M8 and
2020M12) alone or with subsequent challenge with Streptococcus
pneumoniae (pneumococci). The inflammatory response and the bacterial
burden of both species over time were determined by Western blot,
luciferase assay, cytokine bead array, flow cytometry and viable plate
counts on blood agar plates.ResultsClinical isolates of Corynebacteria
were well tolerated by human cells and mice. Corynebacteria induced a
transient inflammatory response during healthy conditions in the absence
of known pathogens. Pre-exposure or nasal priming with Corynebacteria
did not affect subsequent acquisition of pneumococci but were associated
with a modulated inflammatory response in vitro and in vivo as well as
with a reduced pneumococcal burden in the respiratory tract of mice.
This indicates that the presence of C. propinquum or C.
pseudodiphtheriticum may protect against severe pneumococcal
infections.ConclusionsIn this study, we delineate the role of
Corynebacteria from the normal microbiota that epidemiologically
associate with respiratory health. We show that the presence of
Corynebacteria modulates the inflammatory response to pneumococci and
associate with faster decrease in pneumococcal burden, primarily in the
lower respiratory tract. Our data indicate that Corynebacteria has
potential to protect against severe pneumococcal infections.</p>

id="development-of-a-one-step-multiplex-rt-qpcr-method-for-rapid-detection-of-bovine-diarrhea-viruses">Development
of a one-step multiplex RT-qPCR method for rapid detection of bovine
diarrhea viruses</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionViral calf diarrhea poses a significant challenge to the
cattle industry worldwide due to its high morbidity and mortality rates,
leading to substantial economic losses. The clinical symptoms associated
with various diarrhea pathogens often overlap, complicating accurate
diagnosis; thus, there is an urgent need for rapid and precise
diagnostic methods to improve prevention and treatment efforts. In this
study, we developed a one-step multiplex reverse-transcription
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (mRT-qPCR) that enables
the simultaneous detection of three key viral pathogens responsible for
calf diarrhea: bovine kobuvirus (BKoV), bovine astrovirus (BoAstV), and
bovine torovirus (BToV). However, development of accurate and rapid
methods to distinguish these three viruses is helpful for the early
detection, disease surveillance, and control of viral calf
diarrhea.MethodsSpecific primers and minor groove binder (MGB)-based
probes were designed targeting the 3D region of BKoV, ORF1 region of
BoAstV, and N region of BToV. The sensitivity, specificity, and
reproducibility ability were evaluated for the mRT-qPCR. Further, 80
bovine fecal samples were subjected to the mRT-qPCR, and the results
were verified using conventional reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) or
PCR methods and sequencing methods.ResultsThis novel method demonstrated
high sensitivity and specificity,achieving a detection limit of 24
copies/mL for each pathogen. Furthermore, the assay exhibited excellent
reproducibility, with coefficients of variation below 1.5%, a strong
linear correlation (R2 &gt; 0.996), and an amplification efficiency
between 90% and 110%. Validation with 80 clinical samples from both
diarrheic and non-diarrheic cattle across four farms in Shanghai showed
a high degree of concordance with RT-PCR, with positive detection rates
for BKoV, BoAstV, and BToV at 28.75%, 8.75%, and 3.75%, respectively,
highlighting the predominance of BKoV and BoAstV. Notably, this study
represents the first identification of BKoV, BoAstV, and BToV in the
Shanghai region.DiscussionThe mRT-qPCR is a robust, rapid, and simple
tool for identifying viral pathogens associated with calf diarrhea,
facilitating the development of effective prevention and control
measures that are vital for the future sustainability of the cattle
industry.</p>

interplays in the gut-liver axis: implications for liver cancer
pathogenesis and therapeutic insights</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Globally, primary liver cancer (PLC) ranks the most fatal malignancy.
Most of the patients are in advanced stage of PLC at the very time they
are diagnosed with it, accounting much for its poor prognosis. With the
advancement of modern medical research and care system, the main
etiology of PLC more and more switches from hepatitis viruses such as
HAV, HBV, HCV, HEV to other causes like metabolism-associated
steatohepatitis (MASH) and metabolic-associated fatty liver disease
(MAFLD). As a result, it is of great necessity to find out new ways for
treatment and early diagnosis to cope with this problem. Nowadays, as
the mechanism of the Gut-Liver Axis in the formation of MAFLD, MASH and
PLC has been gradually elucidated. The association between gut
microbiome and the formation of PLC is of great significance to take an
insight into. In this review, we present the concept of Gut-Liver Axis
and its function in the mutual influence between gut microbiota and PLC
from several aspects in which we will focus on the structure of gut
barrier and the functional influences the gut microbiota have on the
immune response and metabolic changes on human liver. Furthermore, we
conclude the potential association of gut microbiota constitution with
the PLC. Eventually, we hope this review can offer novel instructions
for early diagnosis and treatment for liver cancer.</p>

and characterization of bovine hepacivirus in cattle and sheep from
Hulunbuir, northeastern China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundBovine hepacivirus (BovHepV) is a recently identified
member of the expanding genus Hepacivirus within the family
Flaviviridae. However, the genetic diversity, geographical distribution,
and host range of the virus remains poorly understood.MethodsIn this
study, serum samples from cattle and sheep were obtained in Hulunbuir
and pooled to establish RNA libraries, which were then analyzed using
transcriptome sequencing. BovHepV-positive samples were confirmed using
semi-nested PCR with primers designed based on the obtained viral
sequences. Comprehensive bioinformatics analyses were employed to assess
sequence similarity, phylogenetic evolution, and recombination of the
obtained viral strains.ResultsA total of 988 serum samples from sheep
(520) and cattle (468) were collected from 12 administrative districts
in Hulunbuir from June to August, 2022. Semi-nested PCR revealed 6
BovHepV-positive districts with prevalence ranging from 2.0% to 35.0% in
cattle, and one BovHepV-positive district with prevalence of 2.5% in
sheep. The nucleotide sequence identities between viral strains from
sheep and cattle ranged from 91.3% to 93.8%, while the amino acid
sequence identities were between 95.4% and 96.7%. Phylogenetic analyses
classified the obtained BovHepV strains within subtype G, genotype 1.
Recombination analysis revealed the intergenerational relationships
among the viral strains obtained from cattle and sheep.ConclusionWe
identified genetic diversity in subtype G strains in cattle and detected
a BovHepV strain in a sheep for the first time in northeastern China,
confirming cross-species transmission and co-circulation between cattle
and sheep, thus expanding the virus’s host range.</p>

costus alleviates ulcerative colitis by regulating the gut microbiota
and improving intestinal barrier integrity</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe global health challenge of ulcerative colitis (UC)
has been classified by the WHO as a modern refractory disease, commonly
referred to as green cancer, with limited treatment options still
available, highlighting the urgent need for the development of new
therapeutic strategies. Recent pharmacological research has shown that
traditional Chinese medicine saussurea costus (SC) possesses beneficial
antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. Nevertheless, its
underlying mechanism remains elusive.MethodsFirstly, we identified the
main active components of SC through UHPLC-QTOF-MS analysis.
Subsequently, UC mice were induced using DSS and administered different
doses of SC to evaluate its efficacy. Additionally, the impact of SC on
the repair of the intestinal mucosal barrier was evaluated through
immunofluorescence and western blot. Furthermore, 16s rRNA gene
sequencing was conducted to elucidate the contribution of gut microbiota
to UC pathogenesis.ResultsThe primary components of SC include Proline,
Phenylalanine, Isoleucine, Lucidenic acid M, and Pyroglutamic acid. The
efficacy of SC was concurrently assessed, revealing its potential to
ameliorate histological injury in colitis mice. Furthermore, SC was
found to decrease levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-8, and IL-18 while
promoting the expression of IL-10 and IL-22. Similarly, we also found
that the expression of ZO-1 and Occludin was reversed by SC in colitis
mice. In addition, analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated that
SC reduced harmful bacterial populations, such as Proteobacteria, while
simultaneously enhancing the levels of beneficial bacteria like
Lactobacillus, thereby contributing to the improvement of UC
pathology.ConclusionThis study highlights the therapeutic potential of
SC in managing UC through its ability to attenuate inflammatory
responses, restore intestinal barrier functionality, and modulate gut
microbiota composition, which findings offer insights into potential
strategies for advancing UC treatment.</p>

profiles analysis of effects of Toxoplasma gondii rhoptry protein 16 on
THP-1 macrophages</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionToxoplasma gondii, an intracellular parasitic protozoan,
is globally recognized for its ability to cause parasitic diseases and
has developed diverse strategies to evade immune-mediated elimination.
The protein ROP16 of T.gondii plays a crucial role in this evasion
process by specifically targeting macrophages and mononuclear phagocytes
in vivo. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the involvement of
type II ROP16 proteins in infection, inflammation, and other processes
remain unknown.MethodsTo investigate the mechanism of action of
gonococcal ROP16 proteins in human macrophages, we constructed a
lentivirus overexpressing ROP16 and established stably transfected cell
lines. We then analyzed the gene transcriptional profiles of ROP16 II in
THP-1 macrophages using transcriptome sequencing. Interaction networks
were constructed by screening differentially expressed genes and
performing gene function enrichment analysis.ResultsAs a result, five
differentially expressed genes were identified: AAMDC, GPR158, RAD9A,
STOML1, and STRA13. Immuno-featured differential analysis showed that
type 17 T helper cells were more strongly correlated with GPR158 and
STRA13, while CD8 T-cell was most strongly correlated with
STOML1.DiscussionTherefore, we conclude that the ROP16 protein plays a
pivotal role in THP-1 macrophage infection and these five differentially
expressed genes may serve as promising molecular targets for the
prevention or control of toxoplasmosis. These findings have significant
implications for the diagnosis and treatment of toxoplasmosis.</p>

Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionTo investigate the prevalence of Tritrichomonas foetus,
Pentatrichomonas hominis, Giardia intestinalis, Cryptosporidium,
Microsporidium, and Sarcocystis in domestic cats in Anhui Province,
China, and their potential role as zoonotic hosts for human infection, a
total of 304 fecal samples from two different sources were screened for
the presence of related pathogens.MethodsUsing microscopy, along with
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or nested PCR amplification, followed by
genotyping through sequence analysis.ResultsThe infection rates of T.
foetus, P. hominis, G. intestinalis, Cryptosporidium, Enterocytozoon
bieneusi, and Sarcocystis were 5.6%, 0%, 1.7%, 0.7%, 2.6%, and 0%,
respectively. The evolutionary relationships and genetic characteristics
of G. intestinalis based on the GDH gene, Cryptosporidium based on the
SSU rRNA gene, and E. bieneusi based on the ITS sequence were assessed:
five cases of G. intestinalis were identified, with four belonging to
assemblage F and one to zoonotic assemblage B, two Cryptosporidium cases
were identified as Cryptosporidium felis, and all eight E. bieneusi
cases were identified as belonging to group 1, with three cases being
genotype D, three EbpA, and two EbpC.DiscussionAge, neutering status,
and deworming were identified as potential risk factors. Further
analysis revealed that diarrhea, as a clinical symptom, could serve as
an indicator for pathogen infection. Although the pathogen infection
rates detected in this study were relatively low, their zoonotic
transmission potential cannot be ignored. Therefore, special attention
should be paid, and it is essential to establish targeted prevention
plans.</p>

of factors affecting the clinical management of infection in
culture-negative patients following percutaneous endoscopic
decompression: a retrospective study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundCulture-negative spinal infections after prophylactic
antibiotic use in percutaneous endoscopic decompression are rare, and
diagnostic difficulties and the risk of antibiotic-resistant infections
complicate treatment. This study retrospectively analyzed the medical
records of culture-negative patients following percutaneous endoscopic
surgery to identify risk factors influencing antimicrobial therapy and
provide insights for clinical management.MethodsData were
retrospectively collected from patients who underwent lumbar
percutaneous endoscopic decompression at the Affiliated Hospital of
Qingdao University between January 2014 and June 2023. The patients’
medical records were reviewed. Patient demographics, hidden blood loss,
daily blood glucose control, and maximum temperature during treatment
were recorded as potential risk factors. C-reactive protein,
procalcitonin, white blood cells, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and
the duration of antibiotic treatment were used as indicators of
infection treatment. The impact of these risk factors on infection was
then analyzed.ResultsThe results showed that blood glucose control was
strongly correlated with the severity of infection (Beta = 0.60, P =
0.00), strongly correlated with short-term treatment effectiveness (Beta
= 0.65, P = 0.00), and moderately correlated with the duration of
antibiotic treatment (Beta = 0.41, P = 0.01). Hidden blood loss was
moderately correlated with the severity of infection (Partial-R = 0.49,
P = 0.00) and moderately correlated with the duration of antibiotic
treatment (Partial-R = 0.48, P = 0.00). Hidden blood loss index was
moderately correlated with the duration of antibiotic treatment
(Partial-R = 0.50, P = 0.00). Female was a favorable factor to shorten
the duration of antibiotic treatment (Beta = -0.25, P = 0.01), and
higher maximum temperature during infection may indicate a longer
duration of antibiotic treatment (Beta = 0.28, P = 0.02).ConclusionOur
findings suggest that healthy blood glucose levels, a lower hidden blood
loss and hidden blood loss index might help reduce the duration of
antibiotic use after infection. Effective hemostasis during surgery to
reduce hidden blood loss and good preoperative blood glucose control
indicators are both beneficial measures for infection treatment.</p>

secreted host-cell protein clusterin interacts with PmpD and promotes
Chlamydia trachomatis infection</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Attachment and uptake into host cells are pivotal steps in the life
cycle of the Chlamydiaceae, a family of obligate intracellular
pathogens. Chlamydia trachomatis (Ctr) possesses a family of nine
polymorphic membrane proteins (Pmps), which have been shown to be
crucial for adhesion and internalization. However, the host-cell
molecules involved have so far remained unknown. Here, we show that a
fragment of Ctr PmpD, which forms high-molecular-weight oligomers in
solution and adheres to epithelial cells, also binds to secreted
clusterin (sCLU), a chaperone-like protein that is secreted into the
extracellular space by the host cell, and forms part of the chaperone-
and receptor-mediated extracellular protein degradation (CRED) pathway.
Using in vitro assays, we demonstrate that sCLU interacts directly with
soluble rPmpD. In infection experiments, depletion of sCLU from the
culture medium leads to a significant decrease in Ctr infection. Thus,
sCLU is the first host-cell interaction partner identified for a Ctr Pmp
and the first case in which sCLU has been shown to be a vital component
for the establishment of a bacterial infection.</p>

<p>BackgroundCarbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) is a
critical pathogen in healthcare settings, associated with high mortality
due to its extensive antibiotic resistance. In this study, we report an
outbreak of CRKP in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) within a
200-bed tertiary hospital. The main goal of this study was to
characterize the phenotypic and genomic profiles of the CRKP isolates
involved in the outbreak and to gain insights into their resistance
mechanisms and transmission dynamics within the NICU.MethodsThe study
was conducted between November and December 2023 in a 5-bed NICU.
Monthly surveillance cultures were performed to monitor colonization and
infection with multidrug-resistant organisms. CRKP isolates were
obtained from blood and nasal swabs of affected neonates. Identification
and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were initially conducted using
the Vitek®2 system with an N-395 card and further confirmed by 16S rRNA
sequencing. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and antimicrobial resistance
(AMR) profiling were performed to identify resistance genes and
virulence factors. For genetic analysis, both Illumina short-read and
Nanopore long-read sequencing were used, followed by hybrid assembly for
enhanced genome resolution. Plasmid and resistance gene profiles were
determined using AMRFinder and PlasmidFinder databases.ResultsA total of
three CRKP isolates (designated Kp1, Kp2, and Kp3) were identified. Kp1
and Kp2 belonged to sequence type (ST) ST23 and were genetically
near-identical, differing by a single allele, while Kp3 was of a
distinct sequence type, ST2096, with 245 allelic differences from Kp1
and Kp2. All isolates were resistant to colistin and carried resistance
genes, including mcr-1 and blaNDM-1,blaKPC2 confirming carbapenem
resistance. Efflux pump genes and aminoglycoside resistance genes were
also detected, providing a multifaceted defence against antibiotics.
Plasmid analysis identified several incompatibility groups (IncFI,
IncHI, IncFIB, IncX), indicating the potential for horizontal gene
transfer of resistance determinants.ConclusionThis study highlights the
complexity of CRKP outbreaks in neonatal care, with isolates exhibiting
resistance mechanisms that complicate treatment. The plasmid profiles
suggest these strains are reservoirs for multidrug-resistant genes,
emphasizing the need for strict infection control and ongoing genomic
surveillance. For neonatal care, these resistance challenges increase
the risk of treatment failures and mortality, underscoring the
importance of enhanced infection prevention and novel therapeutic
strategies.</p>
