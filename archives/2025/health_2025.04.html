protozoa in pet cats from Anhui province: prevalence and molecular
characterization</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionTo investigate the prevalence of Tritrichomonas foetus,
Pentatrichomonas hominis, Giardia intestinalis, Cryptosporidium,
Microsporidium, and Sarcocystis in domestic cats in Anhui Province,
China, and their potential role as zoonotic hosts for human infection, a
total of 304 fecal samples from two different sources were screened for
the presence of related pathogens.MethodsUsing microscopy, along with
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or nested PCR amplification, followed by
genotyping through sequence analysis.ResultsThe infection rates of T.
foetus, P. hominis, G. intestinalis, Cryptosporidium, Enterocytozoon
bieneusi, and Sarcocystis were 5.6%, 0%, 1.7%, 0.7%, 2.6%, and 0%,
respectively. The evolutionary relationships and genetic characteristics
of G. intestinalis based on the GDH gene, Cryptosporidium based on the
SSU rRNA gene, and E. bieneusi based on the ITS sequence were assessed:
five cases of G. intestinalis were identified, with four belonging to
assemblage F and one to zoonotic assemblage B, two Cryptosporidium cases
were identified as Cryptosporidium felis, and all eight E. bieneusi
cases were identified as belonging to group 1, with three cases being
genotype D, three EbpA, and two EbpC.DiscussionAge, neutering status,
and deworming were identified as potential risk factors. Further
analysis revealed that diarrhea, as a clinical symptom, could serve as
an indicator for pathogen infection. Although the pathogen infection
rates detected in this study were relatively low, their zoonotic
transmission potential cannot be ignored. Therefore, special attention
should be paid, and it is essential to establish targeted prevention
plans.</p>

of factors affecting the clinical management of infection in
culture-negative patients following percutaneous endoscopic
decompression: a retrospective study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundCulture-negative spinal infections after prophylactic
antibiotic use in percutaneous endoscopic decompression are rare, and
diagnostic difficulties and the risk of antibiotic-resistant infections
complicate treatment. This study retrospectively analyzed the medical
records of culture-negative patients following percutaneous endoscopic
surgery to identify risk factors influencing antimicrobial therapy and
provide insights for clinical management.MethodsData were
retrospectively collected from patients who underwent lumbar
percutaneous endoscopic decompression at the Affiliated Hospital of
Qingdao University between January 2014 and June 2023. The patients’
medical records were reviewed. Patient demographics, hidden blood loss,
daily blood glucose control, and maximum temperature during treatment
were recorded as potential risk factors. C-reactive protein,
procalcitonin, white blood cells, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and
the duration of antibiotic treatment were used as indicators of
infection treatment. The impact of these risk factors on infection was
then analyzed.ResultsThe results showed that blood glucose control was
strongly correlated with the severity of infection (Beta = 0.60, P =
0.00), strongly correlated with short-term treatment effectiveness (Beta
= 0.65, P = 0.00), and moderately correlated with the duration of
antibiotic treatment (Beta = 0.41, P = 0.01). Hidden blood loss was
moderately correlated with the severity of infection (Partial-R = 0.49,
P = 0.00) and moderately correlated with the duration of antibiotic
treatment (Partial-R = 0.48, P = 0.00). Hidden blood loss index was
moderately correlated with the duration of antibiotic treatment
(Partial-R = 0.50, P = 0.00). Female was a favorable factor to shorten
the duration of antibiotic treatment (Beta = -0.25, P = 0.01), and
higher maximum temperature during infection may indicate a longer
duration of antibiotic treatment (Beta = 0.28, P = 0.02).ConclusionOur
findings suggest that healthy blood glucose levels, a lower hidden blood
loss and hidden blood loss index might help reduce the duration of
antibiotic use after infection. Effective hemostasis during surgery to
reduce hidden blood loss and good preoperative blood glucose control
indicators are both beneficial measures for infection treatment.</p>

secreted host-cell protein clusterin interacts with PmpD and promotes
Chlamydia trachomatis infection</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Attachment and uptake into host cells are pivotal steps in the life
cycle of the Chlamydiaceae, a family of obligate intracellular
pathogens. Chlamydia trachomatis (Ctr) possesses a family of nine
polymorphic membrane proteins (Pmps), which have been shown to be
crucial for adhesion and internalization. However, the host-cell
molecules involved have so far remained unknown. Here, we show that a
fragment of Ctr PmpD, which forms high-molecular-weight oligomers in
solution and adheres to epithelial cells, also binds to secreted
clusterin (sCLU), a chaperone-like protein that is secreted into the
extracellular space by the host cell, and forms part of the chaperone-
and receptor-mediated extracellular protein degradation (CRED) pathway.
Using in vitro assays, we demonstrate that sCLU interacts directly with
soluble rPmpD. In infection experiments, depletion of sCLU from the
culture medium leads to a significant decrease in Ctr infection. Thus,
sCLU is the first host-cell interaction partner identified for a Ctr Pmp
and the first case in which sCLU has been shown to be a vital component
for the establishment of a bacterial infection.</p>

drafting of nosocomial infection CRE Klebsiella pneumoniae confirming
resistance to colistin and eravacycline, carrying blaNDM-1, mcr-1, and
blaKPC-2, in neonatology from November to December 2023</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundCarbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) is a
critical pathogen in healthcare settings, associated with high mortality
due to its extensive antibiotic resistance. In this study, we report an
outbreak of CRKP in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) within a
200-bed tertiary hospital. The main goal of this study was to
characterize the phenotypic and genomic profiles of the CRKP isolates
involved in the outbreak and to gain insights into their resistance
mechanisms and transmission dynamics within the NICU.MethodsThe study
was conducted between November and December 2023 in a 5-bed NICU.
Monthly surveillance cultures were performed to monitor colonization and
infection with multidrug-resistant organisms. CRKP isolates were
obtained from blood and nasal swabs of affected neonates. Identification
and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were initially conducted using
the Vitek®2 system with an N-395 card and further confirmed by 16S rRNA
sequencing. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and antimicrobial resistance
(AMR) profiling were performed to identify resistance genes and
virulence factors. For genetic analysis, both Illumina short-read and
Nanopore long-read sequencing were used, followed by hybrid assembly for
enhanced genome resolution. Plasmid and resistance gene profiles were
determined using AMRFinder and PlasmidFinder databases.ResultsA total of
three CRKP isolates (designated Kp1, Kp2, and Kp3) were identified. Kp1
and Kp2 belonged to sequence type (ST) ST23 and were genetically
near-identical, differing by a single allele, while Kp3 was of a
distinct sequence type, ST2096, with 245 allelic differences from Kp1
and Kp2. All isolates were resistant to colistin and carried resistance
genes, including mcr-1 and blaNDM-1,blaKPC2 confirming carbapenem
resistance. Efflux pump genes and aminoglycoside resistance genes were
also detected, providing a multifaceted defence against antibiotics.
Plasmid analysis identified several incompatibility groups (IncFI,
IncHI, IncFIB, IncX), indicating the potential for horizontal gene
transfer of resistance determinants.ConclusionThis study highlights the
complexity of CRKP outbreaks in neonatal care, with isolates exhibiting
resistance mechanisms that complicate treatment. The plasmid profiles
suggest these strains are reservoirs for multidrug-resistant genes,
emphasizing the need for strict infection control and ongoing genomic
surveillance. For neonatal care, these resistance challenges increase
the risk of treatment failures and mortality, underscoring the
importance of enhanced infection prevention and novel therapeutic
strategies.</p>
