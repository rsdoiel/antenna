## Comparison of the gut microbiota in older people with and without sarcopenia: a systematic review and meta-analysis

date: 2025-04-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionSarcopenia, an age-related disorder marked by decreased skeletal muscle mass, strength, and function, is associated with negative health impacts in individuals and financial burdens on families and society. Studies have suggested that age-related alterations in gut microbiota may contribute to the development of sarcopenia in older people through the gut-muscle axis, thus modulation of gut microbiota may be a promising approach for sarcopenia treatment. However, the characteristic gut microbiota for sarcopenia has not been consistent across studies. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the diversity and compositional differences in the gut microbiota of older people with and without sarcopenia, and to identify gut microbiota biomarkers with therapeutic potential for sarcopenia.MethodsThe PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang Database were searched studies about the gut microbiota characteristics in older people with sarcopenia. The quality of included articles was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Weighted standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for α-diversity index were estimated using a random effects model. Qualitative synthesis was conducted for β-diversity and the correlation between gut microbiota and muscle parameters. The relative abundance of the gut microbiota was analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively, respectively.ResultsPooled estimates showed that α-diversity was significantly lower in older people with sarcopenia (SMD: -0.41, 95% CI: -0.57 to -0.26, I²: 71%, P < 0.00001). The findings of β-diversity varied across included studies. In addition, our study identified gut microbiota showing a potential and negative correlation with sarcopenia, such as Prevotella, Slackia, Agathobacter, Alloprevotella, Prevotella copri, Prevotellaceae sp., Bacteroides coprophilus, Mitsuokella multacida, Bacteroides massiliensis, Bacteroides coprocola Conversely, a potential and positive correlation was observed with opportunistic pathogens like Escherichia-Shigella, Eggerthella, Eggerthella lenta and Collinsella aerofaciens.DiscussionThis study showed that α-diversity is decreased in sarcopenia, probably predominantly due to diminished richness rather than evenness. In addition, although findings of β-diversity varied across included studies, the overall trend toward a decrease in SCFAs-producing bacteria and an increase in conditionally pathogenic bacteria. This study provides new ideas for targeting the gut microbiota for the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia.Systematic review registrationhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42024573090, identifier CRD42024573090.

## Wound repair and immune function in the Pseudomonas infected CF lung: before and after highly effective modulator therapy

date: 2025-04-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The leading cause of death for people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) continues to be due to respiratory-related illnesses. Both wound repair and immune cell responses are dysregulated in the CF airways, creating a cycle of unresolved injury and perpetuating inflammation. PwCF are predisposed to colonization and infections with opportunistic bacteria like Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa), the most common adult pathogen in CF. Pa possesses key virulence factors that can exacerbate chronic inflammation and lung injury. With the approval of highly effective modulator therapies like elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI), pwCF eligible for ETI have seen drastic improvements in lung function and clinical outcomes, including an increased life expectancy. While modulator therapies are improving bronchial epithelial cellular processes in wound repair and some areas of immunity, many of these processes do not reach a non-CF baseline state or have not been thoroughly studied. The effect of modulator therapy on Pa may lead to a reduction in infection, but in more longitudinal studies, there is not always eradication of Pa, and colonization and infection frequency can return to pre-modulator levels over time. Finally, in this review we explore the current state of additional treatments for CF lung disease, independent of CFTR genotype, including anti-inflammatories, phage-therapies, and Pa vaccines.

## Genomic epidemiology of a novel Pandoraea pneumonica group caused severe bloodstream infection in Hainan, China, 2021-2024

date: 2025-04-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionRarely does Pandoraea occur in bloodstream infections (BSI), although it’s typically found in cystic fibrosis. This study aims to decipher the genetic map and obtain insights of clinical symptoms into Pandoraea from BSI patients. Methods30 suspected BSI patients' diagnostic records and medical histories were recorded. Pandoraea spp. isolates were collected and subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, Sanger sequencing and Whole-genome sequencing (WGS). ResultsOf the 30 clinical cases, five (16.67%) ultimately died, whereas 25 (83.33%) are alive. 30 purified Pandoraea isolates showed high degree of MIC values to Meropenem, Amoxicillin and Potassium Clavulanate, Gentamicin, and Ceftazidime. Then, all isolates were identified as P. pneumonica based on the 16S rRNA-based phylogenetic analysis. Among 28 genomes of them, the average genome size and average GC contents were 5,397,568 bp, and 62.43%, respectively. However, WP1 displayed high similarity (90.6%) to reference Pandoraea sp. LMG 31114. Genetic differences between the tested isolates and LMG 31114 suggested that the outbreak’s causative pathogen could be a novel cluster of P. pneumonica. The genomes accumulated mutations at an estimated rate of 1.3 × 10-7 mutations/year/site. Moreover, 26 clinical isolates within the P. pneumonica cluster were formed in July 2014, revealing a tendency to develop regional endemic patterns. ConclusionBSI caused by this novel cluster of P. pneumonica is linked to significant morbidity and mortality. Such cluster remains a critical public health challenge due to their regional epidemiological patterns and antibiotic treatment risk. This study contributed to the basis on pathogen identification, disease diagnosis, and BSI treatment.

## Unveiling Wolbachia transcriptomic signature in the arboviral vector Aedes aegypti

date: 2025-04-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe mosquito Aedes aegypti is the main vector of arboviral diseases such as dengue and imposes a global health burden. A promising control strategy is to infect A. aegypti populations with Wolbachia, a genus of intracellular bacteria capable of blocking arboviral infections. Enhancing and preserving the efficacy of this method will depend on a solid mechanistic knowledge of the A. aegypti-Wolbachia symbiosis. By identifying differences between Wolbachia-infected and uninfected A. aegypti, previous transcriptomic studies proposed a wide range of symbiotic interactions, but a systematic identification of consistent effects across datasets is still missing.MethodsTo identify A. aegypti genes and functions consistently affected by Wolbachia, we performed differential expression and functional enrichment analysis on published transcriptomic datasets, followed by a meta-analysis of the obtained p-values using the maxP method. Six datasets were retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus, Sequence Read Archive and ArrayExpress (last searched in July 2024, considering lack of replication as the exclusion criteria). After discarding one dataset from wAlbB-infected cell line due to poor mapping to the A. aegypti genome, the data comprised adult female A. aegypti heads, muscles, carcasses, midguts and bodies, and Wolbachia strains wMel and wMelPop.Results and DiscussionMeta-analysis revealed 10 and 21 consistently down- and upregulated host genes, some of which have escaped the focus of previous research, including the consistently downregulated exonuclease AAEL009650 which has a pro-dengue virus homolog in Drosophila. At the function level, we found consistent upregulation of electron transport chain (ETC), carbohydrate transport and serine-type peptidase activity and inhibition, and downregulation of DNA replication. ETC upregulation suggests an alternative mechanism for Wolbachia’s induction of antiviral oxidative stress, previously attributed to dual- and NADPH-oxidases which here showed downregulation or no regulation. Through analysis of previously published datasets, this work identifies promising molecular and functional targets for future studies aimed at elucidating the most fundamental mechanisms of the A. aegypti–Wolbachia symbiosis.

## Plasma thrombomodulin is a valuable biomarker to predict the severity of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome caused by the Hantaan virus

date: 2025-04-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectivesThis study aimed to investigate the Thrombomodulin (TM) levels in patients who suffered hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) of varying severities, and to evaluate the predictive properties of TM for the seriousness of HFRS, thereby providing a clue for the monitoring and management of this patients in the future.MethodsChemiluminescence was used to determine the concentrations of TM in 196 patients with HFRS and 49 healthy controls. Conventional testing techniques were used to test the basic clinical reference values for leukocytes, platelets (PLT), C-reactive protein (CRP), creatine (Cr), uric acid (UA), and urea, and the values for activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, and fibrinogen. The colloidal gold method was used to measure HFRS antibody levels in the patients. The correlation of TM with conventional parameters was assessed using Spearman correlation analysis, and ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the severity risk factors. The predictive potency of TM for HFRS patients’ severity was evaluated by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis.ResultsThe concentrations of TM increased with disease severity and peaked in the critical type patients. In addition, plasma levels of TM were proportionally correlated with the levels of leukocytes (r= 0.4218; p<0.01), creatine (r= 0.3797; p<0.01), urea (r= 0.3763; p<0.01), uric acid (r= 0.3624; p<0.01), and C-reactive protein (r= 0.2767; p<0.01). Conversely, there was an inverse correlation between TM, platelet counts (r= -0.4509; p<0.01), and fibrinogen levels (r= -0.2431; p<0.01). Furthermore, TM demonstrated significant predictive value for the severity of HFRS with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.872(95% CI: 0.822-0.921, P<0.001).ConclusionsTM levels are associated with HFRS severity, suggesting that TM detection might be beneficial for monitoring the status and effective management of HFRS patients.

## Integrative multi-omics analysis of the microbiome and metabolome in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with early-stage lung cancer

date: 2025-04-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Lung cancer is a significant health concern that poses a considerable threat to human health and quality of life. In order to enhance the prognosis of patients with lung cancer, we conducted a combined analysis of 16S rDNA gene sequencing of alveolar lavage fluid and LC-MS metabolomics research, with the objective of identifying biomarkers in patients with early-stage lung cancer presenting as SPN. A comparison of the benign nodule group and the early-stage lung cancer patients revealed that the phylum-level Bacteroidetes and the genus-level Chryseobacterium and Delftia were more abundant in the latter group. Additionally, the Fusobacteriales might serve as a predictive marker for the diagnosis of early-stage lung cancer. In the context of metabolomics, the early-stage lung cancer was found to be characterised by elevated levels of specific metabolites, including Alternariol, dTMP, Oxymatrine, Gedunin, PC 36:4. Conversely, reductions in other metabolites, such as LPC O-24:0, PC 18:2_18:3, PC 19:2_19:2, Cholecalciferol and T-2 Triol, were also observed. Correlation analyses demonstrated that alveolar lavage microorganisms were closely associated with differential metabolites. Specifically, reductions in Cholecalciferol were associated with a variety of high-abundance flora and involved in vitamin digestion and absorption pathways. Furthermore, reductions in cholecalciferol may serve as a robust predictor of early-stage lung cancer. These findings provide new predictive biomarkers for early-stage lung cancer manifested by SPN, which is clinically important and requires further study of the potential mechanisms of action and function of the targets.

## Genomic analysis of prophages in 44 clinical strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated in Saudi Arabia

date: 2025-04-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Prophages are bacteriophages that integrate their genomes into the bacterial chromosome. This research aimed to analyze and characterize prophages integrated into 44 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from tertiary hospitals in Saudi Arabia. A total of 97 intact prophages were identified among clinical strains, with 16 prophages found present in more than one strain simultaneously. All prophages were found to have lengths ranging from 7.7 kb to 74.1 kb, and their GC content was found to be between 49.91% and 64.9%. Our findings show that prophages are present in the majority of the isolated P. aeruginosa strains (41 out of 44). Additionally, several proteins related to viral defense (toxin/antitoxin modules and proteins against restriction-modification enzymes) were identified, supporting the idea that prophages influence bacterial pathogenesis and anti-phage defenses.

## Aneuploidy enables adaptation to brefeldin A in Candida albicans

date: 2025-04-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Candida albicans is the most prevalent opportunistic fungal pathogen. Both in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that genome plasticity is a hallmark of C. albicans. While aneuploidy formation is a well-documented adaptive mechanism under various stress conditions, the response to brefeldin A—a compound that induces endoplasmic reticulum stress—remains poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that C. albicans adapts to subinhibitory and inhibitory concentrations of brefeldin A, primarily through the formation of chromosome 3 trisomy. These aneuploid strains were found to be unstable, reverting to euploidy in the absence of stress, accompanied by a loss of brefeldin A tolerance. We identified at least two genes on chromosome 3, SEC7 and CDR1, that contribute to this adaptive response. Notably, higher concentrations of brefeldin A selected for strains with increasingly complex aneuploidies. Our findings underscore the remarkable genomic plasticity of C. albicans and reveal aneuploidy as a reversible mechanism for adapting to brefeldin A stress. This study provides new insights into the role of aneuploidy in fungal adaptation and offers potential implications for understanding drug resistance mechanisms in pathogenic fungi.

## Prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Ureaplasma urealyticum infections in males and females of childbearing age in Chengdu, China

date: 2025-04-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundSexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a global public health issue, due to their high prevalence and potential impact on pregnancy outcome and fetal health. The objective of this study is to investigate the prevalence of STI-causative pathogens including Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU) as well as the epidemiological characteristics of STIs among males and females of childbearing age in Chengdu.MethodsThis retrospective cross-sectional study involved 15,055 participants of childbearing age including 7,235 males and 7,820 females. All specimens of participants were tested for CT, NG, and UU by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) methods.Results27.80% of the participants were infected with at least one of the three pathogens, with significantly higher overall prevalence in females (45.22%) than males (8.98%, p<0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that gender was independently associated with both CT positivity (females vs males, OR 2.276, 95% CI 1.724-3.005, p<0.001) and UU positivity (females vs males, OR 8.079, 95% CI 7.183-9.086, p<0.001). Single infections predominated in both males and females (males: 98.15%; females: 93.16%), while mixed infections were more frequent in females (6.84%) than in males (1.85%). CT prevalence was highest in both males and females aged 18-24, followed by aged 25–30 and 31-35. Among aged 18-24, the prevalence of UU in males and NG and UU in females were also higher. Compared to other age groups, mixed infections (CT+NG, CT+UU, NG+UU, CT+NG+UU) were also highest in females aged 18-24. Compared to other clinical diagnostic groups, The prevalence of CT, NG and mixed infection of CT+NG was highest in both males and females in the urogenital inflammation group (p<0.05).ConclusionsAmong the population of childbearing age in Chengdu, China, the prevalence among females was significantly higher than that among males. Single infections predominated in both males and females, while mixed infections occurred more frequently in females. STIs were more prevalent in sexually active young people aged 18-35, especially in the 18–24 age group. CT and NG infections in both males and females may cause urogenital inflammation, and mixed infections of CT+NG further elevate the risk of inflammatory responses.

## Advances in whole genome sequencing for foodborne pathogens: implications for clinical infectious disease surveillance and public health

date: 2025-04-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Foodborne outbreaks affecting millions of people worldwide are a significant and growing global health threat, exacerbated by the emergence of new and increasingly virulent foodborne pathogens. Traditional methods of detecting these outbreaks, including culture-based techniques, serotyping and molecular methods such as real-time PCR, are still widely used. However, these approaches often lack the precision and resolution required to definitively trace the source of an outbreak and distinguish between closely related strains of pathogens. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has emerged as a revolutionary tool in outbreak investigations, providing high-resolution, comprehensive genetic data that allows accurate species identification and strain differentiation. WGS also facilitates the detection of virulence and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, providing critical insight into the potential pathogenicity, treatment/control options and risks of spreading foodborne pathogens. This capability enhances outbreak surveillance, source tracing and risk assessment, making WGS an increasingly integrated component of public health surveillance systems. Despite its advantages, the widespread implementation of WGS faces several pressing challenges, including high sequencing costs, the need for specialized bioinformatics expertise, limited computational infrastructure in resource-constrained settings, and the standardization of data-sharing frameworks across regulatory and public health agencies. Addressing these barriers is crucial to maximizing the impact of WGS on foodborne disease surveillance. Even so, WGS is emerging as a vital tool in food safety and public health, and its potential to become the gold standard in outbreak detection has been recognized by public health authorities in the USA, the European Union, Australia and China, for example. This review highlights the role of WGS in foodborne outbreak investigations, its implementation challenges, and its impact on public health surveillance.

## Clinical application of metagenomic next-generation sequencing in etiologic diagnosis of severe pneumonia in adults

date: 2025-04-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveTo analyze the clinical characteristics and risk factors for death of severe pneumonia (SP) in adults and explore the application value of metagenomic next-generation sequencing in the detection of pathogens.MethodsA total of 132 adult patients with SP admitted from May 2021 to October 2023 were selected. Data on gender, age, smoking, underlying diseases, laboratory tests and prognosis were collected. BALF samples were sent for mNGS, smear-stained microscopy and culture. Meanwhile, conventional methods were used for pathogen detection of blood, urine and throat swab specimens. The detection efficiencies of different methods were compared and the associated pathogen profiles were analyzed.ResultsAmong the 132 patients, there were 92 males and 40 females, with a total of 52 deaths. Age≥65 years, heart failure, renal insufficiency, positive of COVID-19, use of vasoactive drugs, use of mechanical ventilation and use of CRRT were statistically different between the survivors and non-survivors. Heart failure (OR=4.751) and use of mechanical ventilation (OR=11.914) were risk factors of SP mortality. The bacteria detected were mainly Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The fungi detected were mainly Candida and Aspergillus. The viruses detected were mainly COVID-19 and influenza virus. The positive rate of mNGS was higher than conventional methods in both bacteria, fungus and virus (82.58% vs 63.64%, 50.76% vs 37.88% and 67.42% vs 37.88%, respectively) (P<0.05). The sensitivity and accuracy of mNGS in bacterial detection were significantly higher than traditional methods (P<0.05). Compared to culture, mNGS detected more Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli, and had a significant advantage in the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, Nontuberculous mycobacterial, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia psittaci, Pneumocystis jirovecii and Aspergillus. Moreover, mNGS can better indicate mixed infections of bacteria, viruses, or fungi.ConclusionElderly people with chronic diseases were the main group of severe pneumonia in adults. The pathogenic microorganisms that caused SP are complex, and mixed infection is common. mNGS enhanced the effectiveness of pathogen detection, makes up for the shortcomings of conventional methods, especially in identifying unexpected pathogens, and provides a new means for early targeted anti-infection treatment.

## Clinical evaluation of personalized Helicobacter pylori treatment guided by PCR detection from fecal samples: a real-world study

date: 2025-04-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundGrowing antibiotic resistance in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) diminishes eradication therapy effectiveness, emphasizing the need for accurate, non-invasive diagnostic techniques. This study aims to assess the clinical utility of PCR analysis of fecal samples for detecting antibiotic resistance in guiding personalized treatment for H. pylori infection.MethodsA retrospective, observational study was conducted across 13 hospitals within Jiangsu Province. Fecal samples were analyzed using fluorescence PCR for the 23S rRNA and gyrA genes, indicating clarithromycin and levofloxacin resistance. Then, individualized eradication recommendations were proposed for the H. pylori-positive patients. A follow-up was performed one year later to evaluate the eradication outcomes in a routine medical environment, with participants having provided informed consent.ResultsA total of 387 participants completed the eradication treatment, with an overall success rate of 91.0% (352/387, 95% CI: 87.6%-93.6%). Among them, 310 individuals received a 14-day course of bismuth quadruple therapy (BQT), achieving an eradication rate of 90.0% (279/310, 95% CI: 86.1%-93.1%). 77 participants were treated with high-dose dual therapy (HDDT) for the same duration, resulting in a slightly higher eradication rate of 94.8% (73/77, 95% CI: 87.2%-98.6%), although this difference was not statistically significant (P=0.188). No significant differences in eradication rates were observed among various BQT antibiotic combinations (P=0.208). The eradication rates for HDDT, based on either vonoprazan or esomeprazole, were 96.8% (61/63, 95% CI: 89.0%-99.6%) and 85.7% (12/14, 95% CI: 57.2%-98.2%), respectively, without a significant difference (P=0.304).ConclusionPCR detection from fecal samples targeting the resistance genes of H. pylori is effective in guiding personalized treatments, highlighting its clinical utility and potential for broader application.

## Unlocking the power of antimicrobial peptides: advances in production, optimization, and therapeutics

date: 2025-04-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are critical effectors of innate immunity, presenting a compelling alternative to conventional antibiotics amidst escalating antimicrobial resistance. Their broad-spectrum efficacy and inherent low resistance development are countered by production challenges, including limited yields and proteolytic degradation, which restrict their clinical translation. While chemical synthesis offers precise structural control, it is often prohibitively expensive and complex for large-scale production. Heterologous expression systems provide a scalable, cost-effective platform, but necessitate optimization. This review comprehensively examines established and emerging AMP production strategies, encompassing fusion protein technologies, molecular engineering approaches, rational peptide design, and post-translational modifications, with an emphasis on maximizing yield, bioactivity, stability, and safety. Furthermore, we underscore the transformative role of artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning algorithms, in accelerating AMP discovery and optimization, thereby propelling their expanded therapeutic application and contributing to the global fight against drug-resistant infections.

## Progress on the mechanism of intestinal microbiota against colorectal cancer

date: 2025-04-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The intestinal microbiota plays a crucial role in the occurrence and development of colorectal cancer, and its anti - colorectal cancer mechanism has become a research hotspot. This article comprehensively expounds on the molecular mechanisms of the intestinal microbiota in anti - colorectal cancer, including aspects such as immune regulation, activation of carcinogenic signaling pathways (it should be noted that it is more reasonable to be “inhibition of carcinogenic signaling pathways”), metabolite - mediated effects, and maintenance of intestinal barrier function. At the same time, it explores the roles and potential mechanisms of intervention methods such as probiotic supplementation therapy, immunotherapy, and fecal microbiota transplantation. In addition, it analyzes the impact of the intestinal flora on the therapeutic efficacy of colorectal cancer. The existing research results are summarized, and the future research directions are prospected, with the aim of providing new theoretical bases and treatment ideas for the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer.

## Extracellular vesicles in arbovirus infections: from basic biology to potential clinical applications

date: 2025-04-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Arthropod-borne viruses, or arboviruses, are currently considered a global health threat responsible for potentially severe human diseases. The increased population density, changes in land use and climate change are some of the factors that are contributing to the spread of these infections over the last years. The pathogenesis of these diseases and the mechanisms of interaction with the host, especially those leading to the development of severe forms, are yet to be fully understood. In recent years extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as important players in the inter-cellular and host-pathogen interaction arising a lot of interest also in the field of vector-borne viruses. In this context, EVs seem to play a dual role, by either promoting, thus facilitating, or preventing infection. Many studies are showing how viruses can hijack the vesiculation machinery to escape the host immune response and exploit EVs to sustain their replication and propagation, even though EVs shed by immune cells seem essential to promote antiviral responses. In this manuscript we reviewed the current knowledge regarding the association between EVs and vector-borne viruses, paying particular attention to their possible role in disease transmission and dissemination, as well as to their potential as novel tools for clinical applications, spanning from biomarkers of clinical utility to novel therapeutic options.
