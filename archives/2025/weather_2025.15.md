Valid 152000Z - 161200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHEAST AND NEW ENGLAND...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated wind damage will remain possible into the early evening
across parts of the Northeast.

...20Z Northeast...
The prior outlooks remains largely unchanged with only minor
modifications. Broad-scale ascent beneath the upper low over the
Eastern US is supporting scattered, but shallow convection across
the Northeast and New England. Low-topped thunderstorms will likely
continue to pose a risk for occasional damaging gusts this
afternoon. Limited moisture, and resulting buoyancy will continue to
be the limiting factor for more sustained/stronger storms. Have
trimmed the western extent of the Thunder area over parts of PA/OH.
Scattered non-severe storms are also possible over the Four Corners
and western US, see the previous discussion for more info.

..Lyons.. 04/15/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1114 AM CDT Tue Apr 15 2025/

...Northeast...
Within the base of an eastward-moving large-scale trough over the
eastern CONUS, a related 100+ kt midlevel jet streak will pivot
eastward across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast today. Ascent in the
left-exit region of the jet will promote widely scattered,
low-topped convection across the Northeast through the afternoon.
Despite limited post-frontal boundary-layer moisture, diurnal
heating beneath very cold midlevel temperatures will continue to
steepen low-level lapse rates amid strengthening low/mid-level
winds. This environment will support locally damaging convective
wind gusts (45-60 mph) through the afternoon -- especially with any
small clusters/lines that can evolve.  

...Four Corners into southern Colorado...
Isolated high-based thunderstorms are expected across parts of the
Four Corners and southern CO this afternoon, where midlevel moisture
atop a diurnally deepening boundary layer will yield inverted-V
profiles. As a result, a couple locally strong downbursts cannot be
entirely ruled out.

0218 PM CDT Tue Apr 15 2025

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF EASTERN ARIZONA AND
MUCH OF NEW MEXICO...

...Southwest...
An approaching upper-level trough will provide increasing  southwest
flow aloft atop a very dry boundary layer over the Desert Southwest
region. Relative humidity should drop below 10 percent across much
of the lowland areas of southeastern Arizona/Southwestern New Mexico
during peak heating along with widespread 10-15 percent RH spread
across the area by tomorrow afternoon. Expanded Critical and
Elevated highlights due to higher confidence indicated from latest
model guidance consensus.

...Central High Plains...
Elevated mid-level westerly flow will promote downslope drying and
surface wind speeds of 15-20 mph across portions of southeastern
Wyoming and western Nebraska. Minimal precipitation in the area over
the last few days has allowed finer dormant/dead fuels to remain
receptive. Added area of Elevated fire weather conditions to reflect
overall fire weather threat.

..Williams/Moore.. 04/15/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0130 AM CDT Tue Apr 15 2025/

...Synopsis...
An upper low off the southern California coast will begin to phase
with a trough within the Northwest. Strong mid-level winds will
develop over the Southwest by late afternoon. A surface low will
deepen near the Colorado/Kansas border.

...Southwest...
A broad area of elevated to critical fire weather is expected from
southern/eastern Arizona into much of New Mexico and parts of
southeast Colorado. Strong mid-level winds and the deepening surface
low will combine to promote 15-25 mph surface winds (highest in
terrain-favored areas). Critical fire weather is most likely to
occur from southeast Arizona into southwest/west-central New Mexico.
Here, strong winds will combine with areas of 5-15% RH. Elsewhere
within the region, combinations of weaker winds and slightly higher
RH (10-20%) will preclude critical highlights.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0204 PM CDT Tue Apr 15 2025

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IOWA...NORTHERN
MISSOURI...EASTERN/CENTRAL NEBRASKA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms, with a primary threat of large hail,
are possible on Thursday evening/night, centered on eastern/central
Nebraska, northern Missouri, and Iowa.

...Synopsis...
Large scale troughing is progged from portions of the Canadian
Prairies into the Intermountain West and Great Basin on Thursday. A
deepening surface low will shift eastward across the northern
central/high Plains, with a dryline extending from southern Nebraska
into central Kansas and Oklahoma. A triple point formed by a
secondary surface low circulation, dryline, and a frontal
boundary/modified outflow in central Nebraska will be the focus of
additional development by the late afternoon/evening across
central/eastern Nebraska.

...Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri...
Elevated thunderstorm activity is expected to be ongoing at the
beginning of the D3 period across portions of eastern Nebraska into
western Iowa and Missouri. Some instances of severe hail will be
possible with this activity.

Moisture return will be ongoing through much of the day, with upper
50s to 60s dew points from central Nebraska into Iowa, eastern
Kansas, and western Missouri. Additional development is expected
late afternoon into the early evening across the aforementioned
triple point in central Nebraska. Daytime heating and moisture
return will yield MLCAPE around 1500-2000 J/kg amid steep low to
mid-level lapse rates and ample deep layer shear. This environment
will support supercells, some of which may be initially surface
based and capable of very large hail and damaging wind. Further east
across Iowa and northern Missouri, MLCIN will be in place behind
morning convection. Cells may become elevated with eastward
movement, but will still pose potential for large hail and damaging
wind. The Slight was expanded westward into Nebraska to support this
potential. Storms will continue into portions of western Illinois
through the end of the period.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1223 PM CDT Tue Apr 15 2025

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PORTIONS OF THE
CENTRAL GREAT PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms, with a primary threat of large hail,
are possible on Wednesday evening/night across parts of the central
Great Plains.

...Synopsis...
A progressive open wave trough will shift southward from Canada
before phasing with an upper-level low off the west coast of
California on Wednesday. The subtropical jet will spread eastward
across the central Plains, with several embedded shortwave
disturbances rippling through the flow. Westerly flow across the
central/southern Rockies will promote lee cyclogenesis late in the
period, with an increase in a southerly low-level jet across the
southern/central Plains. 

...Central Great Plains...
Southerly return flow will bring an increase of moisture into the
central Plains, with potential for isolated to scattered
thunderstorm development. A limiting factor remains increasing CIN
and low-level stability beneath a strong EML. Regardless, agreement
has increased on convective initiation occurring near the dryline
across portions of central/southern Kansas late in the period. Given
the elevated nature of this convection, the greatest risk will be
for large hail. This will continue into the lower MO Valley through
the end of the period Thursday morning.

Earlier in the period, some potential exists for development further
south near the OK/KS border toward the end of peak heating in the
early evening. A few hi-res solutions have hinted at development of
a supercell or two within this region, apparent in UH tracks from
the 12z HREF. Conditionally, an established supercell in this region
could support very large hail, given steep lapse rates aloft and
ample shear/CAPE.

...Elsewhere...
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are expected from
northern/central California into the Great Basin and northern
Rockies through the period. These are expected to be sub-severe
given weak shear profiles.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1135 AM CDT Tue Apr 15 2025

Valid 151700Z - 161200Z

...Arizona/New Mexico...
Increasing but still modest mid-level flow ahead of an upper-level
trough combined with a very dry, well-mixed boundary layer is still
expected to result in Elevated fire weather conditions across
southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico today.

...Appalachians...
Farther east, post-frontal winds from the northwest at 15-20 mph
coincident with leeward downslope drying from the Appalachians are
expected today across the Piedmont region. However, fuels are less
receptive to wildfire spread as green-up accelerates across the area
so Elevated highlights were withheld.

..Williams/Moore.. 04/15/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0128 AM CDT Tue Apr 15 2025/

...Synopsis...
A cold front will move off the East Coast, leaving a dry airmass in
its wake. A surface high will push cooler air into the Plains and
into parts of the southern Rockies. A belt of stronger mid-level
winds will be present within the Southwest. Embedded shortwave
troughs may further enhance these winds locally.

...Arizona/New Mexico...
The shortwave trough expected to impact eastern Arizona and western
New Mexico has had a slight weakening trend in guidance. Even so,
some enhancement to the mid-level winds are expected to occur during
the afternoon. West of the cold air intrusion in the southern
Rockies, temperatures will warm into the 80s to perhaps near 90 F.
This will support RH of 15-20%. Winds will not be particularly
strong, but 15 mph with localized pockets of 20 mph is possible.
Elevated fire weather is expected.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0358 AM CDT Tue Apr 15 2025

Valid 181200Z - 231200Z

...DISCUSSION...
An active severe weather pattern expected through at least this
weekend, before predictability diminishes early next week.

...D4/Friday...
Guidance remains consistent with a broad swath of strong mid-level
southwesterlies from the southern High Plains to the Great Lakes,
downstream of a longwave trough from northern ON to the Lower CO
Valley. This will overlap a similarly oriented surface front. In
response to increasing mid-level height falls, a surface cyclone
should track across the central Great Lakes portion of the
baroclinic zone during the day. Afternoon severe may be focused in
this region with stronger low-level shear. Parts of this region may
warrant higher probabilities in later outlooks.

Farther southwest, a pronounced EML may delay the bulk of storm
development along the front until evening. But given the strong
deep-layer shear and moderate buoyancy, scattered severe storms
appear possible. 

...D5/Saturday...
Amplification of an embedded northern-stream shortwave impulse over
ON/QC should sustain an expansive swath of strong mid-level flow
from the OH Valley northeastward. The northeast extent of
appreciable instability overlapping with this regime becomes
nebulous east of the Appalachians, but scattered severe storms seem
possible from the Cumberland Plateau into the Mid-South on Saturday
afternoon to evening.

Over the southern Great Plains, lingering convection Saturday
morning renders uncertainty along the largely stalling baroclinic
zone that will undoubtedly be modified by convective outflow. But
with greater consistency in guidance handling the pivot of the basal
shortwave impulse across the Southwest, multiple rounds of strong to
severe convection are plausible through Saturday night. 

...D6/Sunday...
Predictability lessens by this period with the evolution of compact
shortwave trough ejecting onto the southern Great Plains. This
yields substantial spread in the attendant synoptic cyclone. In
addition, potentially extensive ongoing convection Sunday morning
further lessens confidence in mesoscale details. But a belt of
potentially very strong mid-level southwesterlies overlapping rich
western Gulf moisture supports inclusion of a severe-area highlight
in the South-Central States.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 141810Z - 142115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Showers spreading southeastward through the mid Missouri
Valley may begin to intensify by 3-4 PM CDT, with a few weak
thunderstorms developing and posing increasing potential for strong
to severe surface gusts while spreading southeastward through the
remainder of the afternoon.

DISCUSSION...In the wake of a deep cyclone, now migrating northeast
of the Upper Great Lakes region, downward mixing of momentum is
already contributing to 30-35+ kt northwesterly surface gusts across
much of the middle Missouri Valley, as boundary-layer warming
progresses.  This is occurring just ahead of a vigorous short wave
trough now digging through the western Dakotas, and forecast to
continue rapidly southeastward through early evening.  

Models indicate that the mid-level cold core (including -30 to -35C
around 500 mb) will overspread a corridor from central South Dakota
through northeastern Iowa between 20-23Z, coincident with further
strengthening of northwesterly flow (35-40+ kt) in the 850-700 mb
layer and peak afternoon surface heating.  As this occurs, forecast
soundings indicate that profiles will become increasingly conducive
to deepening convection capable of producing lightning. 

With at least some further intensification of ongoing developing
convection, evaporative cooling and melting of precipitation within
an increasing well-mixed boundary layer (characterized by sizable
surface temperature/dew point spreads on the order of 20+ F),
coupled with the downward mixing of stronger flow aloft, seems
likely to contribute to increasing potential for surface gusts
approaching or briefly exceeding severe limits.  This may continue
into early evening, as convection spreads southeastward, before
rapidly diminishing with the onset of boundary-layer cooling.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 138
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
325 PM EDT Mon Apr 14 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central and Eastern Kentucky
  Southern Ohio
  Far Southwestern Pennsylvania
  Southwestern Virginia
  West Virginia

* Effective this Monday afternoon and evening from 325 PM until
  1100 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms coverage is expected to increase over the
next few hours along and ahead of a cold front pushing eastward
across the region. Environmental conditions support strong to severe
storms. An initially cellular mode will favor large hail and
damaging gusts before a transition to a more linear storm mode
favors primarily damaging gusts.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles north and south of a line from 30 miles west of
Lexington KY to 60 miles north northeast of White Sulphur Springs
WV. For a complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch
outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
24040.

Valid 141300Z - 151200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
INTO EARLY TONIGHT FROM EASTERN KENTUCKY ACROSS WEST VIRGINIA INTO
CENTRAL VIRGINIA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe storms are expected this afternoon
through early tonight from the Upper Ohio Valley eastward to the
Mid-Atlantic. Large hail, severe wind gusts, and a couple of
tornadoes will be possible.

...Upper OH Valley this afternoon into VA early tonight...
An initial shortwave trough and surface cyclone will occlude by
tonight between Lake Superior and James Bay, as an upstream
shortwave trough digs southeastward from the northern Plains toward
the OH Valley.  An associated surface cold front will move
southeastward across the OH Valley today, while a corridor of
moisture return occurs ahead of the front from the Mid-South to WV. 
Surface heating in cloud breaks will drive temperatures into the 70s
by early-mid afternoon, coincident with northeastward advection of
55-60 F boundary-layer dewpoints beneath the northeastward extent of
an elevated mixed layer.  Though the upstream moisture source is
rather modest by mid April standards, recent green up and unusually
moist ground across the OH Valley will augment evapotranspiration. 
These processes will result in MLCAPE of 1000-1500 J/kg with minimal
convective inhibition as low-level ascent focuses along the front.

Thunderstorm development is expected by mid afternoon in a broken
band along the cold front from northern KY into southern OH, and
storms subsequently expand in coverage while spreading
east-southeastward across WV into VA through early tonight.  The
moderate buoyancy and long hodographs will support supercells
capable of producing large hail of 1-2 inches in diameter, and
damaging winds of 60-75 mph are also expected, especially with any
upscale growth into bowing segments.  Low-level shear/hodograph
curvature will be sufficient for some tornado threat, though this
will be modulated by the degree of low-level moistening. 
Clusters/line segments will persist east of the Appalachians into VA
through early tonight, though the severe threat will diminish with
eastward extent and after 03z. 

...SD to IA this afternoon/evening...
Despite limited low-level moisture, surface heating beneath cooling
midlevel temperatures will support weak surface-based buoyancy and
the potential for low-topped thunderstorms from SD into IA (in
advance of the digging shortwave trough now over western ND/eastern
MT).  Relatively cold temperature profiles will favor some threat
for small hail, while steep low-level lapse rates and 30+ kt flow
through the mixed layer favor gusty outflow winds of 40-50 mph.
