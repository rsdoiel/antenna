...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
INTO EARLY TONIGHT FROM EASTERN KENTUCKY ACROSS WEST VIRGINIA INTO
CENTRAL VIRGINIA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe storms are expected this afternoon
through early tonight from the Upper Ohio Valley eastward to the
Mid-Atlantic. Large hail, severe wind gusts, and a couple of
tornadoes will be possible.

...Upper OH Valley this afternoon into VA early tonight...
An initial shortwave trough and surface cyclone will occlude by
tonight between Lake Superior and James Bay, as an upstream
shortwave trough digs southeastward from the northern Plains toward
the OH Valley.  An associated surface cold front will move
southeastward across the OH Valley today, while a corridor of
moisture return occurs ahead of the front from the Mid-South to WV. 
Surface heating in cloud breaks will drive temperatures into the 70s
by early-mid afternoon, coincident with northeastward advection of
55-60 F boundary-layer dewpoints beneath the northeastward extent of
an elevated mixed layer.  Though the upstream moisture source is
rather modest by mid April standards, recent green up and unusually
moist ground across the OH Valley will augment evapotranspiration. 
These processes will result in MLCAPE of 1000-1500 J/kg with minimal
convective inhibition as low-level ascent focuses along the front.

Thunderstorm development is expected by mid afternoon in a broken
band along the cold front from northern KY into southern OH, and
storms subsequently expand in coverage while spreading
east-southeastward across WV into VA through early tonight.  The
moderate buoyancy and long hodographs will support supercells
capable of producing large hail of 1-2 inches in diameter, and
damaging winds of 60-75 mph are also expected, especially with any
upscale growth into bowing segments.  Low-level shear/hodograph
curvature will be sufficient for some tornado threat, though this
will be modulated by the degree of low-level moistening. 
Clusters/line segments will persist east of the Appalachians into VA
through early tonight, though the severe threat will diminish with
eastward extent and after 03z. 

...SD to IA this afternoon/evening...
Despite limited low-level moisture, surface heating beneath cooling
midlevel temperatures will support weak surface-based buoyancy and
the potential for low-topped thunderstorms from SD into IA (in
advance of the digging shortwave trough now over western ND/eastern
MT).  Relatively cold temperature profiles will favor some threat
for small hail, while steep low-level lapse rates and 30+ kt flow
through the mixed layer favor gusty outflow winds of 40-50 mph.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0350 AM CDT Mon Apr 14 2025

Valid 171200Z - 221200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Active severe weather pattern expected late week into the weekend.

...D4/Thursday...
A longwave trough should become clearly anchored over the West and
consist of multiple embedded shortwave impulses. Peak surface
cyclone amplitude is largely progged over western KS on Thursday
afternoon, with a dryline arcing across eastern KS into the southern
Great Plains. Another day of modifying moisture return northward
from the western Gulf should yield at least moderate buoyancy ahead
of the dryline. A strengthening low-level jet should support
thunderstorm development across the Lower MO to Mid-MS Valleys on
Thursday evening. Supercell wind profiles support potentially
scattered severe storms.

...D5/Friday...
A broad swath of strong mid-level southwesterlies appears likely
to become established from the southern High Plains to the Great
Lakes, downstream of a longwave trough from James Bay to the Lower
CO Valley. While the deep cyclone over the KS vicinity will weaken,
it should move towards the central Great Lakes. From along/ahead of
its track to the trailing cold front arcing southwestward into west
TX, extensive thunderstorm development is anticipated Friday
afternoon/evening. Given the strong mid-level flow regime, scattered
severe storms are possible across an elongated corridor.

...D6-7/Saturday-Sunday...
Predictability for a 15 percent highlight remains too low during the
weekend, but areas will probably be needed in later outlooks.
Guidance has trended neutral to slightly weaker/more confined
potential on Saturday. Overall signal persists of bimodal primary
threat areas across the Lower Mid-Atlantic States and southern
High/Great Plains. For the former, the degree of instability and
position of a southeast-moving cold front on the periphery of
stronger zonal mid-level flow remain key uncertainty factors. For
the latter, timing of the pivot and eastward ejection of the compact
Lower CO Valley shortwave impulse across the Southwest/southern
Rockies remains crucial. Guidance has shown poor run-to-run
continuity for Sunday, yielding low confidence on spatial details of
the severe threat. Across both regimes and days, NSSL GEFS ML sub-15
percent probabilities appear quite reasonable.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms will be possible from the Upper Mississippi Valley to
the Great Lakes, and from the central Rockies to the lower Missouri
Valley through tonight. Severe thunderstorms are not expected.

...20z Update...
The prior forecast remains valid with only minimal changes to the
western edge of the Thunder area. Isolated thunderstorms ongoing
over parts of the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes should spread eastward
through tonight. Additional elevated thunderstorms will remain
possible across the OH Valley and Midwest as the low-level jet
increases overnight. Given limited moisture, instability is forecast
to remain too weak to support a severe threat. See the previous
discussion for more info.

..Lyons.. 04/13/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1100 AM CDT Sun Apr 13 2025/

...Synopsis and Discussion...
A mid-level shortwave trough will move eastward from the northern
High Plains to the Upper Midwest by late tonight, as a surface low
develops northeastward from eastern NE/KS to the upper Great Lakes.
Limited low-level moisture return will continue through the period
within the warm sector of this cyclone. But, sufficient
ascent/saturation will likely remain confined to near the IA/MN
border this afternoon, where elevated thunderstorms are ongoing.
Some small hail may occur with this activity. This elevated
convection is expected to spread eastward over WI and parts of Lower
MI through the late evening.

Farther west, isolated thunderstorms will be possible this afternoon
into early evening along a southward-moving cold front across CO,
and overnight into MO where moistening and weak ascent atop the
front (near/above 700 mb) could support elevated convection by
09-12z. Across all these areas, instability is forecast to remain
too weak to support organized severe thunderstorms.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0251 PM CDT Sun Apr 13 2025

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

In this morning's 12Z guidance, a drying trend was noted across
portions of eastern Nebraska, bringing expected RH into the 20-25%
range. Also, fuels in this region have not yet greened up and are
therefore still relatively dry. Therefore, have brought the Elevated
fire highlight eastward towards the Missouri River.

Additionally, strong winds (gusts to 25-30 mph) may occur across
portions of South Carolina tomorrow afternoon. However, RH is
currently expected to be a bit too high to support an Elevated fire
risk, likely 30-35%, though brief, localized areas of 25-30% RH are
possible. Furthermore, fuels are probably not receptive to fire
spread, given recent rainfall. Therefore, have not introduced any
highlights on this outlook.

Beyond these two areas, the forecast is on track. See the previous
discussion for further details.

..Supinie.. 04/13/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0153 AM CDT Sun Apr 13 2025/

...Synopsis...
The Upper Midwest upper trough will broaden and intensify as it
moves eastward into the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic on Monday. A cold
front will continue south and east, pushing into the northern Gulf.
Strong post-frontal winds at the surface and aloft will continue on
the western flank of the upper trough.

...Southwest South Dakota into central Kansas...
Strong northwesterly winds will persist across much of the Plains
during the morning and early afternoon. Winds just above the surface
will also maintain some intensity into the afternoon, promoting
stronger gusts as well. Sustained winds of 15-20 mph appear most
probable. Winds will tend to gradually weaken mid/late afternoon as
surface low moves farther east and the surface high weakens to the
west. RH of 20-30% will occur, with the lowest values expected
farther south and west. There has been some tendency for guidance to
shift the area of elevated fire weather risk farther south/west. The
elevated area has been shifted accordingly. Strong winds will still
occur near the Missouri River, but RH is expected to be much higher.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not forecast on Tuesday.

...Synopsis...
A large upper trough will move rapidly eastward from the Great Lakes
and OH Valley into the Mid Atlantic and Northeast, with a surface
high pushing into the lower MS Valley and Southeast. The drying
behind this system will significantly reduce thunderstorm chances
over much of the CONUS on Tuesday.

A very low chance of early day convection may exist over far eastern
NC, and over eastern New England as elevated moisture wraps
northwestward toward the low. Elsewhere, isolated general
thunderstorms may occur during the afternoon over the Sierra, and
into parts of western CO in association with midlevel moisture and
cool temperatures aloft.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM EASTERN
KENTUCKY AND OHIO INTO THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe storms are possible Monday from
mid-afternoon to mid-evening across parts of the Upper Ohio Valley
and central Appalachians.

...Ohio Valley into the Mid Atlantic...
An upper low will deepen from Lake Superior into eastern Ontario on
Monday, with an amplifying upper trough from the northern Plains
into the OH Valley late. 

At the surface, a cold front will extend south from the Ontario low,
affecting OH and KY prior to 00Z. A narrow zone of mid to upper 50s
F dewpoints will spread northeastward ahead of the front, with
pockets of heating. This will lead to 1000-1500 J/kg MUCAPE from KY
into WV, with lower values northward across OH and into western PA.

Gradual height falls along with increasing midlevel moisture will
overspread the diurnally prepared boundary layer over KY, southern
OH and WV, with scattered strong to severe storms developing by late
afternoon.

Strong deep-layer shear will favor cellular activity, with a couple
supercells possible. Despite the primarily veered/westerly flow, any
rightward propagation off the hodograph will result in favorable
SRH, possibly supporting a brief tornado. Otherwise, hail is
expected with the stronger cores, with localized wind damage.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE SOUTHWEST INTO THE
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

Some mid-level clouds are apparent on satellite imagery this morning
associated with a jet streak around the southern periphery of the
northern Plains trough. These may somewhat mute the fire weather
threat over portions of the Texas Panhandle today due to reduced
surface temperatures and reduced mixing, especially when combined
with onset of the spring green up in the eastern portions of the
Texas Panhandle. As such, have slightly trimmed the Critical area in
this region. Otherwise, the forecast appears to be on track. See the
previous discussion for further details.

..Supinie.. 04/13/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0152 AM CDT Sun Apr 13 2025/

...Synopsis...
A northern Plains upper trough will move into the Upper Midwest
today. A surface trough/cold front will move south and east.
Deepening surface lows are expected in the Upper Midwest as well as
the southern High Plains.

...Southwest into Southern Plains...
As the trough moves north of the area, some extension of moderate
mid-level wind will be present across the southern Rockies. A lee
surface low is forecast to develop in the Texas Panhandle. These
features will combine to promote surface winds around 20 mph over a
broad area. RH could be very low in some places (5-10%), though
10-20% will be more common. Critical fire weather will occur for a
several hours across parts of the Southwest into West Texas.

...South Dakota/Nebraska...
Strong, gusty surface winds are expected behind the cold front.
Winds of 15-25 mph appear possible. Cooling behind the front should
lag in part due to a downslope component of the wind off the High
Plains and mid-level drying allowing surface heating to occur. This
should allow RH to fall to 15-25%. Drought impacted grasses will
promote an elevated risk of fire ignition/spread.
