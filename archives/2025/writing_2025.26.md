## 5 Ways to Set Your Screenwriting Intentions

<p>When it comes to being a screenwriter, the creative process is a very personal thing; almost as personal as our voice. That voice is what distinguishes our script from the next, and when it comes to completing a script – no matter how inspired we are – getting all those words on the page can sometimes feel like an insurmountable task.&nbsp;<br><br>Therefore, it’s up to our Creative Process, capital C, capital P, to get the job done! The story wants to come out: we’ve taken up the screenwriter mantle for a reason. Our Creative Process is the thing that will get us to that outcome, so we must invest in cultivating a solid one.<br><br>So when motivation is flagging, the muse has taken up residence elsewhere, the world is feeling heavy, and yet, that tiny little spark of <em>I must write to keep breathing</em> won’t let go of you—what’s a creative writer to do?&nbsp;<br><br>One way to keep screenwriting while the world feels like it’s on fire is to set your intentions—and then follow through with them.</p>

## Setups That Don’t Feel Like Setups

date: 2025-07-01, from: John August blog

<p>John and Craig plant the idea for setups that have the most satisfying payoffs. Different from exposition, setups introduce ideas and concepts to an audience, priming them for a later revelation. They look at the sleight of hand required to have your setups deftly planted, take root in your audience’s mind, and grow into something [&#8230;]</p>

## Constructing a great action sequence

date: 2025-06-30, from: John August blog

<p>On Scriptnotes, we often explore craft topics, looking at the specific choices writers make on the page. But there&#8217;s an obvious challenge when discussing visual storytelling in an audio medium. That&#8217;s why for the most recent Scripnotes video, I wanted to revisit my conversation with Christina Hodson on writing action sequences. In this new format, [&#8230;]</p>

## Write On: 'Countdown' Creator/Writer Derek Haas

date: 2025-06-30, from: Final Draft blog

<div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"> 
 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/write-on-countdown-creator/writer-derek-haas" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/Write%20On%20Countdown%20CreatorWriter%20Derek%20Haas.png" alt="Final Draft's Write On Podcast logo of a mobile device with headphones around it featuring a poster from Countdown" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<p>“One thing I’ve found in the crime genre is that homicides are always interesting. When somebody’s killed, whatever that case may be, it’s usually compelling drama. So then it’s up to you as the writer to surprise the audience and do things that they didn’t think were coming. I’ve described it like this before: If you can hit the sweet spot of, ‘I didn’t see that coming! I should have seen it coming, but I didn’t see it coming,’ That, to me, is the best writing. It’s like, when you got to the end of <em>The Sixth Sense</em>, and you were like, ‘Oh my god, I should have seen that coming!’ That was great writing,” says Derek Haas, creator and writer for the show <em>Countdown</em> on Prime.&nbsp;<br><br>You may know Derek Haas from the popular NBC procedural dramas like <em>Chicago Med, Chicago Fire</em> and <em>Chicago PD</em>. Now, he’s got a new crime drama on Prime called <em>Countdown</em> that tells one twisty crime story over 13 episodes – all written by Haas. Set in Los Angeles, <em>Countdown</em> follows a secret task force who discover a sinister international plot that threatens millions of lives. The show stars Eric Dane, Jensen Ackles and Jessica Camacho as undercover agents all harboring dark secrets of their own.&nbsp;<br><br>On this episode of the podcast, we chat with Haas about starting his career as a crime novelist, writing movies like<em> 2 Fast 2 Furious, 3:10 to Yuma</em> and <em>Wanted</em> before making the switch to TV. Haas talks about working with director John Singleton, prolific TV producer Dick Wolf and writing characters that hook audiences. He also shares his advice for writing action sequences that both stun visually and surprise the audience.&nbsp;<br><br>“When I think about action sequences, I always go back to <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>. My favorite action sequence of any movie ever is when Indiana Jones has to fight this gigantic Nazi guy, and – in any other movie – that would have been the only thing that’s happening. But they put Marion in a plane where she gets trapped because the cover of the plane closes. Then the plane’s propellers start spinning. The plane starts spinning, gas is leaking out of the plane, there’s other people running by with machine guns. So it’s not just, ‘Oh, here’s a fight,’ it’s ‘Here’s a fight, but there’s eight other things happening at once.’ I really try to do that in these chase sequences, because you have seen a million of them. What’s the other factors I can bring to it? How can I show you something you haven’t seen before? Sometimes it’s character, and sometimes, it’s the stunt itself,” says Haas.&nbsp;<br><br>To hear more screenwriting advice from Haas, listen to the podcast. &nbsp;</p>

## The Author-Library Alliance: Supporting Fair eBook Legislation Together

date: 2025-06-30, from: Author's Union blog

In May 2025, Connecticut’s legislature passed landmark legislation to address restrictive ebook licensing practices that limit libraries’ ability to serve the public. It aims to ensure ebook licenses align more closely with  libraries’ core public interest mission of lending, access, and preservation. This represents a pivotal step toward safeguarding the role of libraries in the digital age. As more states consider similar measures, a key question arises: Should authors support these efforts? The answer is unequivocally yes— and here's why.
