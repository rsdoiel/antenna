## Write On: 'Countdown' Creator/Writer Derek Haas

date: 2025-06-30, from: Final Draft blog

<p>“One thing I’ve found in the crime genre is that homicides are always interesting. When somebody’s killed, whatever that case may be, it’s usually compelling drama. So then it’s up to you as the writer to surprise the audience and do things that they didn’t think were coming. I’ve described it like this before: If you can hit the sweet spot of, ‘I didn’t see that coming! I should have seen it coming, but I didn’t see it coming,’ That, to me, is the best writing. It’s like, when you got to the end of <em>The Sixth Sense</em>, and you were like, ‘Oh my god, I should have seen that coming!’ That was great writing,” says Derek Haas, creator and writer for the show <em>Countdown</em> on Prime.&nbsp;<br><br>You may know Derek Haas from the popular NBC procedural dramas like <em>Chicago Med, Chicago Fire</em> and <em>Chicago PD</em>. Now, he’s got a new crime drama on Prime called <em>Countdown</em> that tells one twisty crime story over 13 episodes – all written by Haas. Set in Los Angeles, <em>Countdown</em> follows a secret task force who discover a sinister international plot that threatens millions of lives. The show stars Eric Dane, Jensen Ackles and Jessica Camacho as undercover agents all harboring dark secrets of their own.&nbsp;<br><br>On this episode of the podcast, we chat with Haas about starting his career as a crime novelist, writing movies like<em> 2 Fast 2 Furious, 3:10 to Yuma</em> and <em>Wanted</em> before making the switch to TV. Haas talks about working with director John Singleton, prolific TV producer Dick Wolf and writing characters that hook audiences. He also shares his advice for writing action sequences that both stun visually and surprise the audience.&nbsp;<br><br>“When I think about action sequences, I always go back to <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>. My favorite action sequence of any movie ever is when Indiana Jones has to fight this gigantic Nazi guy, and – in any other movie – that would have been the only thing that’s happening. But they put Marion in a plane where she gets trapped because the cover of the plane closes. Then the plane’s propellers start spinning. The plane starts spinning, gas is leaking out of the plane, there’s other people running by with machine guns. So it’s not just, ‘Oh, here’s a fight,’ it’s ‘Here’s a fight, but there’s eight other things happening at once.’ I really try to do that in these chase sequences, because you have seen a million of them. What’s the other factors I can bring to it? How can I show you something you haven’t seen before? Sometimes it’s character, and sometimes, it’s the stunt itself,” says Haas.&nbsp;<br><br>To hear more screenwriting advice from Haas, listen to the podcast. &nbsp;</p>

## The Author-Library Alliance: Supporting Fair eBook Legislation Together

date: 2025-06-30, from: Author's Union blog

In May 2025, Connecticut’s legislature passed landmark legislation to address restrictive ebook licensing practices that limit libraries’ ability to serve the public. It aims to ensure ebook licenses align more closely with  libraries’ core public interest mission of lending, access, and preservation. This represents a pivotal step toward safeguarding the role of libraries in the digital age. As more states consider similar measures, a key question arises: Should authors support these efforts? The answer is unequivocally yes— and here's why.
