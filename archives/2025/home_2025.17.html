and Care for White Heath Aster Flowers</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-27, from: The Gardener’s Path</p>
<p>
The heath aster is native to the United States where it typically grows
among prairie grasses and in the disrupted soil of roadbeds and
clearings. Ranging in height from one to three feet at maturity, it
readily naturalizes via rhizomes and self-sowing and produces masses of
tiny blossoms from late summer into autumn.
