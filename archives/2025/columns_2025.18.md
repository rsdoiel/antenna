## Keyboard and mouse

date: 2025-05-05, from: Jirka's blog

I have updated my POWER9 box to  the Fedora 41 recently (before a month or so). Since that moment I was suffering mouse problems. I replaced my old mice  (an optical IBM one)  which has mechanical problems  with the left button. The new one (the IBM-branded optical mice, too) worked but was  SLOW and  freezes often.  It was  most noticeable  in the  Firefox (short  freeze  almost  after  any click)  but  similar  behaviour  was noticeable when using file manager (in the MATE) and so. Interestingly, the keyboard has no such issues.

## 2025-05-01 Running the Alps

date: 2025-05-04, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-05-01-running-the-alps">2025-05-01 Running the Alps</h1>

<p>That is, running the Alps with a heart for plants! We arrived in the Vallais today and as soon as we had emptied our luggage we decided to go for a jogging-hike to the Cave du Sex (yeah, that‚Äôs the name! Or Cave du Scex. üòÖ) and we took some pictures on the way.</p>

<p>Buchsbl√§ttriges Kreuzbl√ºmchen<br>
Polygaloides chamaebuxus</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-01-run-the-alps-1.jpg" alt="2025-05-01-run-the-alps-1.jpg" /></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-01-run-the-alps-4.jpg" alt="2025-05-01-run-the-alps-4.jpg" /></p>

<p>The ascent was soon too steep to run but beautiful as the sun began to set.</p>

<p>We are on the southern flanks of the mountains, so the mountains to the south are still lying in the sun while our side is being engulfed in shadows.</p>

<p>From the Cave du Sex we were running along the Bisse du Tsittoret towards Colombire.
This an old waterway along the mountainside to transport water from one alp to the next.
It has been restored for the tourists and it&rsquo;s super nice.
Pretty nice for running, since it follows the gentle slope along the waster.</p>

<p>And the next day, a hike further along Bisse Tsittoret.</p>

<p>Fr√ºhlings-Enzian<br>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-01-run-the-alps-20.jpg" alt="2025-05-01-run-the-alps-20.jpg" /></p>

<p>The bisse was beautiful. So nice to be hiking along a murmuring water. And always slightly downhill.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-01-run-the-alps-21.jpg" alt="2025-05-01-run-the-alps-21.jpg" /></p>

<p>The communities invested in nice wooden benches. I like it!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-01-run-the-alps-22.jpg" alt="2025-05-01-run-the-alps-22.jpg" /></p>

<p>The bisse empties into a wild mountain river. A few meters downhill there&rsquo;s a new beginning but the sluice gate was closed. As it turns out, the bisse got replenished quickly from new rivulets joining from the mountain.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-01-run-the-alps-23.jpg" alt="2025-05-01-run-the-alps-23.jpg" /></p>

<p>This is La Sign√®se, according to Open Street Map (OSM). I also saw it called Bover√®che. OSM claims that&rsquo;s the name of the road. Oh well. There&rsquo;s a nice view point, there.</p>

<p>Alpen-G√§nsekresse (Artengruppe)<br>
Arabis alpina agg.</p>

<p>(plus bumblebee üòç)</p>

<p>Plant identification mostly done by Flora Incognita (<a class="account" href="https://wisskomm.social/@FloraIncognita_DE" title="@FloraIncognita_DE@wisskomm.social">@FloraIncognita_DE</a>) but for the mushroom I fell back to Seek by iNaturalist. What I love about Flora Incognita is that I can follow links to all sorts of reference works, including Wikipedia. Seek, on the other, has nothing. No longer explanation, no link to Wikipedia. Truly, a lost opportunity.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-05-04, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

If you get the <a href="https://subscribe.scripting.com/">nightly email</a>, the text might be a bit more readable. I've increased the font-size from 17px to 18px. I've only been able to do this lately because I could tap into what ChatGPT knew about it, whereas before I was flying blind, with no idea of the unusual things that happen when HTML is sent via email. There is another option, click on the date at the top of each email and that will open the same stuff in the web. It can be easier to make the text larger there than it is in an email client.

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/10/10/ronaldMcGrimace.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">ChatGPT is great for finding information on the public web, but I can't figure out how to find stuff I've worked on with ChatGPT in ChatGPT. There are big usability issues. I think it's getting better in some ways, but it's leaving me more scattered and disorganized than I was before when I took notes outside of ChatGPT. There's another problem, if I want to use my own editing and organizing tools, then the author of the software has to pay the vendor of the LLM for my users using it. That cuts me out, because I don't charge people to use my software, at least not so far, and I have no interest in being a reseller of LLM services. Same problem with Amazon and storage, why won't they sell storage to the user that they can allocate for use with my app, and others. That would give us the kind of power we used to have on the desktop where multiple apps could work on the same file at different times. If I want to make something that stores stuff in the cloud, I have to buy it and resell it. I have tried to discuss this with product runners at companies that could offer this service, it would fit in with what they did. There must be a legal reason here, ie who's responsible for the content being stored.
