## Future Tabs

Too many? Probably. I&#39;m losing count of how many links I&#39;d like to share lead to paywalls or teasewalls (walls teasing a subscription that show up part way through a full read).

## 2025-05-08 Not doing the thing

date: 2025-05-08, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-05-08-not-doing-the-thing">2025-05-08 Not doing the thing</h1>

<p>I was reading stuff on fedi, as one does, wrote a reply, deleted it, moved on, read some more, wrote a reply, deleted it. In both cases I wanted say that the thing people were talking about seemed to me to be that pattern in capitalism where &ldquo;not doing a thing&rdquo; gives you less power over time, so people always end up doing something.</p>

<p>Like &ldquo;buy this to save money&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;don&rsquo;t buy this to save money&rdquo; or &ldquo;buy this keyboard to fight the pain in your wrists&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;work less to fight the pain in your wrists&rdquo;.</p>

<p>If you advocate for not doing a thing, there&rsquo;s no money changing hands and therefore no ads to buy, no voice to gain, no political decisions going your way. Which is a slightly different explanation than greed and greenwashing for the failure of degrowth to take hold: If you sell flights and buy carbon offsets you&rsquo;ll always be growing unlike the competition that sells less flights to lower emissions. Even if the employees of the second company are feeling no need to grow, in the general population, their message will tend to get lost, their percentage of the market, even if enough for them, will continue to shrink, and eventually people will not have heard about them.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how to change that except by laws against doing all the things I think we need to stop doing. Because the entire market, the public speech, the commercial activity, it is all dominated by people who do the thing. Sure, it&rsquo;s greed, in a way, but it&rsquo;s also a ratchet, unstoppable, step by step, a selection process that is ongoing.</p>

<p>Do right and stop doing the thing and you leave that public sphere. Like Voltaire says, tend to your own garden. You&rsquo;ll be happy but the political storms raging around you will seem more and more alien. Because the people that didn&rsquo;t drop out will no longer hear you or see you. The next generation will not learn from you.</p>

<p>So one needs to stay in politics? Fight for the thing even though all the money goes to towards doing the things that we shouldn&rsquo;t be doing?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>

<p>The entire thing reminds me of <a href="2022-02-14_How_to_Do_Nothing">How to Do Nothing</a>.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://toot.cat/@dredmorbius" title="@dredmorbius@toot.cat">@dredmorbius</a> answered with &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t just do something, stand there!&rdquo; What a great reversal of &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t just stand there, do something!&rdquo; (<a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/03/22/stand-there/">Quote Investigator</a>).</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://c.im/@smlckz" title="@smlckz@c.im">@smlckz</a> reminded me of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_ping">tǎng píng</a>, Chinese for &ldquo;lying flat&rdquo; (instead of working hard). In a world of efficiency and productivity, lying flat is resistance.
Or is checking out a way to avoid responsibility? Or the admission of powerlessness? I feel it all.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://photog.social/@ewen" title="@ewen@photog.social">@ewen</a> noted a similar problem in medicine where &ldquo;the three biggest factors in long term health are getting more sleep, drinking more water and getting a little exercise.&rdquo; Which can&rsquo;t be monetised, of course. So somebody else must be talking about this. This reminds me of the reversal at the Chinese imperial court I heard of at one point. No idea if it is true, but the idea seems interesting: there&rsquo;s a physician and they get paid if the patients is healthy. We could get there in part with healthcare paid 100% by taxes, maybe? After all, the state usually pays for campaigns of public health, for the ads, the education, the measures, all of it.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://snac.d34d.net/pkw" title="@pkw@snac.d34d.net">@pkw</a> said: &ldquo;This is a massive problem
with our society. We have no conception or appreciation for the absence of
things so they never get attention.&rdquo; Two examples were provided: regulations and browser features.</p>

<p>And I agree, it’s difficult to take things away. As far as the two examples go, I’m not sure.</p>

<p>Perhaps most additions to legislation (speaking from a Swiss perspective) serve a purpose – we just don&rsquo;t know about it. When I listened to the discussion of The Power Broker on the 99% Invisible podcast, there discussion at end included comments about all the regulations that we introduced so that people can no longer be treated as harshly as they were treated by Robert Moses. These days, of course, people who&rsquo;d like to move quickly and don&rsquo;t mind breaking things would support complaining about the regulations holding them back. But like all calamities, the longer we remember them and the lessons learned at the time, the longer we can avoid repeating the mistakes.</p>

<p>The decisions regarding browsers aren&rsquo;t clear to me, either. It’s possible to reject HTML and serve Gopher or Gemini like I do, but without modern browsers we also drop online applications. Gopher and Gemini have reduced accessibility except for basic text reading, so I feel torn: which part of the browser should we drop? They dropped RSS feeds! Oh no!! They kept VRML? Oh no!! It’s confusing and apparently not as easy to decide what to keep and what to drop because our needs are diverse. I appreciate all the browser features but I don’t appreciate the surveillance. I appreciate all the browser features but I don’t appreciate bloater Electron apps. I guess I still have a hard time deciding. Or worse: why not both and now we have Gopher, Gemini and the modern web. Good? Bad? I don’t know.</p>

<p>I still don&rsquo;t know.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-05-08, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Also, I applied the new Baseline theme to my daveverse site, the one I use to test stuff in WordLand, and occasionally write something with a bit of lasting value. As a result it got a new domain, <a href="https://daveverse.org/">daveverse.org</a>. We're going to offer the <i>Baseline</i> theme for others to use after a bit more testing and refining. But it's getting close. It seems like it's the last big thing on the agenda, but something else will probably pop up. Praise Murphy.

## The Risks OF HODL-ing

Traditionally, the big risk in HODL-ing cryptocurrencies has been their volatility. Fortunately, now the US goverenment is all-in on cryptocurrencies, this risk is greatly reduced. Progress moon-wards is virtually guaranteed, so it is reasonable to invest a small part of your portfolio into Lamborghinis. HODL-ers can  rest easy while the rest of the coins in their wallets appreciate because they are protected by strong cryptography (at least until the advent of a <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2021/11/the-65b-prize.html">sufficiently powerful quantum computer</a>). But progress moon-wards exacerbates some other risks to HODL-ers, as I explain below the fold.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span>
<br />
There is no need to wait while the semiconductor industry develops <a href="https://thequantuminsider.com/2024/12/06/china-introduces-504-qubit-superconducting-chip/">quantum computers</a> in order to defeat the cryptography protecting the HODL-ers wallets. Several effective techniques are already available. North Korea's recent record-breaking $1.5B heist illustrates that deploying malware via a <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/03/software-supply-chain-attack.html"><i>Software Supply Chain Attack</i></a> is capable of compromising even industrial-strength multi-signature wallets.<br />
<br />
The North Korean's haul was big, but slightly smaller heists are routine.  For example, Molly White reports that on 27<sup>th</sup> April 2025 <a href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=bc1qcry-theft"><i>$330 million in Bitcoin apparently stolen; laundering spikes Monero price by over 40%</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
3,250 BTC (~$330 million) were apparently stolen from a bitcoin holder and then quickly moved through multiple exchanges and swapped for the Monero privacycoin. Such a massive swap into Monero was apparently enough to cause the Monero price to spike from around $230 to as high as around $330, before retracting somewhat.
</blockquote>
Another remarkably effective technique is social engineering. A group of scammers used it last August 18<sup>th</sup>, posing as members of Google's and Gemini's security teams to social-engineer "an early investor in cryptocurrency" into downloading malware. He lost more than 4,100BTC, then "worth" about $230M. Mitch Moxley has a fascinating, detailed account of what happened over the next month in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/magazine/crybercrime-crypto-minecraft.html"><i>They Stole a Quarter-Billion in Crypto and Got Caught Within a Month</i></a>.  The scammers immediately started laundering the loot through a series of mixers and sketchy exchanges. These transactions attracted attention from a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/magazine/crybercrime-crypto-minecraft.html">famed cryptocurrency sleuth</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Minutes after the D.C. resident’s funds were liquidated, ZachXBT was walking through the airport on his way to catch a flight when he received an alert on his phone about an unusual transaction. Crypto investigators use tools to monitor the global flows of various coins and set alerts for, say, any transaction over $100,000 that goes through certain exchanges that charge a premium for having few security safeguards. The initial alert that day was for a mid-six-figure transaction, followed by higher amounts, all the way up to $2 million. After he cleared airport security, ZachXBT sat down, opened his laptop and began tracing transactions back to a Bitcoin wallet with roughly $240 million in crypto. Some of the Bitcoin in the wallet dated back to 2012. “At that point it didn’t make sense,” he told me. “Why is a person who held their Bitcoin for this long using a sketchy service that typically sees a lot of illicit funds flow through it?”<br />
<br />
He added the wallets associated with the transactions to his tracking and boarded the plane. Once he connected to in-flight internet, more alerts arrived. Throughout the day, the Bitcoin traced to the wallet was being liquidated through more than 15 different high-fee cryptocurrency services.
</blockquote>
It turned out that one of the group of scammers couldn't resist <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/magazine/crybercrime-crypto-minecraft.html">showing off</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The source sent ZachXBT several screen-share recordings, which he said were taken when one of the scammers livestreamed the heist for a group of his friends. The videos, which totaled an hour and a half, included the call with the victim. One clip featured the scammers’ live reaction when they realized they’d successfully stolen $243 million worth of the D.C. resident’s Bitcoin. A voice can be heard yelling: “Oh, my god! Oh, my god! $243 million! Yes! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Bro!”<br />
<br />
In private chats they used screen names like Swag, $$$ and Meech, but they made a crucial mistake. One of them flashed his Windows home screen, which revealed his real name in the start icon pop-up at the bottom of the screen: Veer Chetal, an 18-year-old from Danbury
</blockquote>
Chetal lived in Danbury, CT. His father Sushil Chetal was a vice-president at Morgan Stanley. He was an incoming freshman at Rutgers. In his senior year he had developed a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/magazine/crybercrime-crypto-minecraft.html">lavish lifestyle</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Classmates remember Chetal as shy and a fan of cars. “He just kind of kept to himself,” says Marco Dias, who became friends with Chetal junior year. According to another classmate named Nick Paris, this was true of Chetal until one day in the middle of his senior year, when he showed up at school driving a Corvette. “He just parked in the lot. It was 7:30 a.m., and everyone was like, What?” Paris says. Soon Chetal rolled up in a BMW, and then a Lamborghini Urus. He started wearing Louis Vuitton shirts and Gucci shoes, and on Senior Skip Day, while Paris and many of his classmates went to a nearby mall, Chetal took some friends, including Dias, to New York to party on a yacht he had rented, where they took photos holding wads of cash.
</blockquote>
On 25<sup>th</sup> August, a week after the $230M heist, Chetal's parents were house-hunting in Danbury in the Lamborghini Urus he had driven to school <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/magazine/crybercrime-crypto-minecraft.html">when</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
the Lamborghini was suddenly rammed from behind by a white Honda Civic. At the same time, a white Ram ProMaster work van cut in front, trapping the Chetals. According to a criminal complaint filed after the incident, a group of six men dressed in black and wearing masks emerged from their vehicles and forced the Chetals from their car, dragging them toward the van’s open side door.<br />
<br />
When Sushil resisted, the assailants hit him with a baseball bat and threatened to kill him. The men bound the couple’s arms and legs with duct tape. They forced Radhika to lie face down and told her not to look at them, even as she struggled to breathe, pleading that she had asthma. They wrapped Sushil’s face with duct tape and hit him several more times with the bat as the van peeled off.

Years ago, Randall Munroe explained a much simpler but only slightly less effective technique for defeating strong cryptography in <a href="https://xkcd.com/538/">XKCD #538</a>. In 2021's <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2021/12/talk-at-ttivanguard-conference.html"><i>Can We Mitigate Cryptocurrencies' Externalities?</i></a> I referred to Jamison Lopp's list of people applying XKCD's technique entitled <a href="https://github.com/jlopp/physical-bitcoin-attacks/blob/master/README.md"><i>Known Physical Bitcoin Attacks</i></a>, which started in 2014 and is still going strong. Already this year Lopp documents 21 attacks, or more than one a week. Among last year's entries we find the kidnapping of Veer Chetal's parents.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/magazine/crybercrime-crypto-minecraft.html">Fortunately</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Several witnesses saw the attack and called 911. Some of them, including an off-duty F.B.I. agent who lived nearby and happened to be at the scene, trailed the van and the Honda, relaying the vehicles’ movements to the police. The F.B.I. agent managed to obtain partial license plate numbers.<br />
<br />
Danbury police officers soon located the van. A patrol vehicle activated its emergency lights and tried to make a stop, but the driver of the van accelerated, swerving recklessly through traffic.<br />
<br />
About a mile from where the chase began, the driver careered off the road and struck a curb. Four suspects fled on foot. The police found one hiding under a bridge and apprehended him after a brief chase. Within a couple of hours, the other three were located hiding in a wooded area nearby. The police, meanwhile, found the shaken Chetals bound in the back of the van.
</blockquote>
In this case the "<a href="https://xkcd.com/538/">$5 wrench</a>" technique was applied indirectly. It appears that Chetal and his accomplices were part of the Com, a group that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/magazine/crybercrime-crypto-minecraft.html">started scamming on Minecraft servers</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In an affidavit from an unrelated case, an F.B.I. agent described the Com as “a geographically diverse group of individuals, organized in various subgroups, all of whom coordinate through online communication applications such as Discord and Telegram to engage in various types of criminal activity.”<br />
...<br />
When the price of Bitcoin began to rise rapidly in 2017, Com members made an easy shift from Minecraft fraud to crypto theft.
</blockquote>
The kidnappers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/magazine/crybercrime-crypto-minecraft.html">clearly</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
targeted the Chetals to hold them ransom for the money their son had. Independent investigators think that at least one member of the group, Reynaldo (Rey) Diaz, who they say went by the alias Pantic, was a member of the Com; ZachXBT speculates that the thieves might have made themselves targets by sharing stories of their spending with other Com members.

Chetal's accomplices are alleged to include "Malone Lam, a known figure in the Com" and Jeandiel Serrano. They also couldn't resist enjoying <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/magazine/crybercrime-crypto-minecraft.html">the fruits of their labors</a>:
<blockquote>
On Sept. 10, after a 23-day party spree in Los Angeles, Lam headed to Miami on a private jet with a group of friends. There, he rented multiple homes, including a 10-bedroom, $7.5 million estate. Within a few days, Lam had filled the driveway with more luxury cars, including multiple Lamborghinis, one with the name “Malone” printed on the side.
</blockquote>
ZachXBT and others were easily able to track Lam's activities on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/magazine/crybercrime-crypto-minecraft.html">social media</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Malone was filmed wearing a white Moncler jacket and what appeared to be diamond rings and diamond-encrusted sunglasses. He stood up on the table and began showering the crowd with hundred-dollar bills. As money rained down, servers paraded in $1,500 bottles of Champagne topped with sparklers and held up signs that read “@Malone.” He spent $569,528 in one evening alone.
</blockquote>
According to the authorities <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/magazine/crybercrime-crypto-minecraft.html">Serrano made a mistake</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
neglecting to use a VPN when he created an account with TradeOgre, a digital currency exchange, which connected to an I.P. address that was registered to a $47,500-per-month rental home in Encino, Calif. It was leased to Jeandiel Serrano, ...  By the time the authorities identified Serrano, he was on vacation in the Maldives with his girlfriend.<br />
<br />
On Sept. 18, Serrano flew back from the Maldives to Los Angeles International Airport, where the authorities were waiting for him. He was wearing a $500,000 watch at the time of his arrest.  ...  Serrano admitted that he owned five cars, two of which were gifts from one of his co-conspirators, given to him with proceeds from a previous fraud. He also confessed to having access to approximately $20 million of the victim’s crypto on his phone and agreed to transfer the funds back to the F.B.I.
</blockquote>
Lam and others <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/magazine/crybercrime-crypto-minecraft.html">were arrested when</a>:<br /> 
<blockquote>
Later that day, a team of F.B.I. agents working with the Miami police raided a mansion near Miami Shores. Agents blew open the front metal gate while another group entered by boat via a small saltwater canal in the rear. The sound of flashbangs rang in the neighborhood as the agents entered the home.
</blockquote>
In an instance of synchronicity, while I was writing this Nate Anderson was writing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/we-have-reached-the-severed-fingers-and-abductions-stage-of-the-crypto-revolution/"><i>We have reached the “severed fingers and abductions” stage of the crypto revolution</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
French gendarmes have been busy policing crypto crimes, but these aren't the usual financial schemes, cons, and HODL! shenanigans one usually reads about. No, these crimes involve abductions, (multiple) severed fingers, and (multiple) people rescued from the trunks of cars—once after being doused with gasoline.<br />
<br />
This previous weekend was particularly nuts, with an older gentleman snatched from the streets of Paris' 14th arrondissement on May 1 by men in ski masks.  ...  The abducted man was apparently the father of someone who had made a packet in crypto. The kidnappers demanded a multimillion-euro ransom from the man's son.<br />
<br />
According to Le Monde, the abducted father was taken to a house in a Parisian suburb, where one of the father's fingers was cut off in the course of ransom negotiations. Police feared "other mutilations" if they were unable to find the man, but they did locate and raid the house this weekend, arresting five people in their 20s.
</blockquote>
Anderson fails to credit Lopp, who has been tracking the problem for more than a decade. He does note the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/we-have-reached-the-severed-fingers-and-abductions-stage-of-the-crypto-revolution/">root of the problem</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Or there's the Belgian man who posted online that "his crypto wallet was now worth €1.6 million." His wife was the <a href="https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2024/12/24/failed-kidnap-attempt-victim-was-bitcoin-millionaires-wife/">victim of an attempted abduction</a> within weeks.
</blockquote>
HODL-ers need to understand that the speed, immutability and (pseudo) anonymity of cryptocurrency transactions eliminates many of the difficulties in applying the "<a href="https://xkcd.com/538/">$5 wrench</a>" technique. Once it is known that you (or your son) hold the key to a cryptocurrency wallet with even a few tens of Bitcoin, you (or your son) become a target for theft. You (or your son) should hope that the threat comes from social engineers like Veer Chetal and his accomplices, in which case your loss will be expensive but painless. But, as Jamison Lopp records, it may well come from people like Rey Diaz.<br />
<br />
The solution is "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity">security through obscurity</a>". If you (or your son) rarely transact and maintain a modest lifestyle, lacking Lamborghinis and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/magazine/crybercrime-crypto-minecraft.html">$569,528</a> bar bills, it isn't likely that your wallet address will be deemed worth deanonymizing. But what is the point of HODL-ing for HODL-ings sake alone? The temptation to "buy the Lambo" is really hard to resist, and the risk seems remote.<br />

## 2025-05-08 I am not interested in clerics

date: 2025-05-08, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-05-08-i-am-not-interested-in-clerics">2025-05-08 I am not interested in clerics</h1>

<p>I noticed a bunch of posts on the topic of clerics.
I got them via the fedibot that reposts the blogs from the OSR Discord server (<a class="account" href="https://social.alexschroeder.ch/@osr" title="@osr@social.alexschroeder.ch">@osr</a>, <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/files/osr-discord.xml">feed</a> <img loading="lazy" src="/pics/rss.svg" alt="RSS" />).
They all linked back to <a href="https://prismaticweekly.substack.com/p/emergency-bandwagon-conclave-edition">Emergency Bandwagon: Conclave Edition</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Pope has died.</strong> A new Pope, his hour come round at last, slouches towards the Chair of Saint Peter to be ensconced. In the meantime, WE BLOGGING.</p>

<p>A new challenge for bloggers: write something in anyway related to clerics (perhaps particularly their hierarchy and rituals?) and post it between when the conclave begins on May 7 and when the smoke emanates from the chimney indicating that a new Pope has been selected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That made me laugh.</p>

<p>Clerics really seem to stir people up!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t like the cleric class. – <a href="https://lootlootlore.blogspot.com/2025/05/splitting-cleric-into-holy-trinity.html">Splitting the cleric into the Holy Trinity</a></p>

<p>Of all the classes, the cleric strikes me as the dullest—so let&rsquo;s fix that. – <a href="https://elmc.at/kill-clerics-become-warlocks/">Kill Clerics, Become Warlocks</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my own house rules, there have been <a href="2016-01-29_No_Clerics">no clerics</a> since 2016.
Back in 2019 I reported that I had <a href="2019-02-08_Still_No_Clerics">still no clerics</a>.
And I still don&rsquo;t.
I also never went back to using &ldquo;paladin&rdquo; abilities as mentioned in that &ldquo;no clerics&rdquo; post
and I never went back to using <a href="2015-10-31_Reputation%2C_again">reputation</a> for &ldquo;divine favour&rdquo;.</p>

<p>As <a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/@phf" title="@phf@tabletop.social">@phf</a> of <a href="http://www.nilisnotnull.com/">((nil) is (not(null)))</a> also uses these house rules to run Barrowmaze and I&rsquo;m an occasional player, I get to use the rules from the player side, too. And it works! It works even if the whole dungeon is filled with undead. It&rsquo;s just harder.</p>

<p>I encourage you to give it a try. An adventure that requires a specific class to be in the party is a dull adventure. Therefore, all adventures can be played without clerics. It might be a bit harder, or it may feel different, but it can be done.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m by no means a fanatic. I&rsquo;ve played clerics. In my <a href="https://ardenvul.com/">Arden Vul</a> game, we use AD&amp;D 1st edition rules. And there are clerics, of course.
It&rsquo;s OK. I don&rsquo;t mind.
The undead turning doesn&rsquo;t really make much of a difference.
And the highest level cleric just recently started multi-classing as a magic-user.</p>

<p>In a way that seems to validate my idea: There are no clerics. Cleric spells are regular spells and magic-users can learn them, if they want. If you want to cast spells and wear armour and wield weapons, play an elf.</p>

<p>That brings me to another idea: I am thinking that we maybe don&rsquo;t need all these classes. We just need fighters and wizards and a multi-class options. If experience always double for the next level, then a fighter-wizard – what used to be an elf – is a level below their peers. Which is exactly the effect of double experience point requirements for elves in B/X or how OD&amp;D elves work where you need to pick fighting elf or spell-casting elf at the beginning of the adventure. That leaves the question of whether comparison: One extra level of wizard is powerful, for sure. Is an extra level of fighter powerful? Probably not so much. A fighter with no wizard levels is simply easier to play. But that&rsquo;s a thought for another day – and no excuse to bring clerics back.</p>

It feels like 2015, when the Mets would be down 9-0 in the seventh, and you'd tune in to see how they would win. At the very end of the Knicks game tonight, when the Celtics were up by 1, I thought how would this feel if the Knicks came back so far and didn't win. I should've known better. All those insufferable years when we wore <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2023/04/27/knicksFansWithBagsOverHeads.png">paper bags to hide our faces</a>, even if this is as far as the Knicks get this year, it will have been worth it. Sports teaches you to believe, if you wait long enough your team teaches you that. I've learned it from the Mets so many times, and the Knicks now. I just wish <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Frazier">Clyde</a> were doing the color with Mike Breen doing the play by play. But who cares, this was great sports. Watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_McNutt">Monica McNutt</a> on MSG in a daze. It's like homecoming. I might just splurge for a ticket to Saturday night's game.

## 4x faster network file sync with rclone (vs rsync)

date: 2025-05-06, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">4x faster network file sync with rclone (vs rsync)</span>

            <p>For the past couple years, I have transported my 'working set' of video and project data to and from work on an external Thunderbolt NVMe SSD.</p>

<p>But it's always been <em>slow</em> when I do the sync. In a typical day, I may generate a new project folder with 500-1000 individual files, and dozens of them may be 1-10 GB in size.</p>

<p>The Thunderbolt drive I had was capable of well over 5 GB/sec, and my 10 Gbps network connection is capable of 1 GB/sec. I even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaV-O6NPWrI">upgraded my Thunderbolt drive to Thunderbolt 5 lately</a>... though that was not the bottleneck.</p>

<p>I used the following rsync command to copy files from a network share mounted on my Mac to the drive (which I call "Shuttle"):</p>

<pre><code>rsync -au --progress --stats /Volumes/mercury/* /Volumes/Shuttle/Video_Projects
</code></pre>

<p><code>mercury</code> is so named because it's a fast NVMe-backed NAS volume on my <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/building-efficient-server-grade-arm-nas">Arm NAS</a> (all my network volumes are named after celestial bodies).</p>

## ChatGPT as proofer? Not here

It is just over a year since <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/05/one-heck-of-halvening.html"><i>One Heck Of A Halvening</i></a>, when Tether had pumped the Bitcoin "price" up to $73,094 the month before. Thanks to <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/video-the-cryptocurrency-industrys-unprecedented-election-spending/"><i>The Cryptocurrency Industry's Unprecedented Election Spending</i></a> it was pumped over $100K and is now around $92K. The security of the Bitcoin blockchain depends upon Proof-of-Work, the idea being that it is more expensive to attack than any possible gains. Thus it is important that miners both spend a lot of money to mine coins, and that they can make a return on their investment in doing so. Now it is time to take a look below the fold at how the miners are doing post-Halvening.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span>
<br />
First I should point out that the idea "that it is more expensive to attack than any possible gains" sounds plausible but is actually an oversimplification. Everyone has decided to ignore Eric Budish's <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w24717"><i>The Economic Limits Of Bitcoin And The Blockchain</i></a>, which shows that, for safety, the value of transactions in a block must be low relative to the fees in the block plus the reward for mining the block. In other words, the value transacted must be less than the total cost of the transaction. Clearly, this means the network is either unsustainable or unsafe. Right now, the average value per block is around $76M but the miners' income per block is around $285K, violating Budish's criterion by a factor of 267.<br />
<br />
Everyone has also decided to ignore Raphael Auer's <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/work765.pdf"><i>Beyond the doomsday economics of “proof-of-work” in cryptocurrencies</i></a>, in which Auer not merely confirms Budish's conclusion but shows that the current violation of Budish's criterion is inevitable because:<br />
<blockquote>
proof-of-work can only achieve payment security if mining income is high, but the transaction market cannot generate an adequate level of income. ... the economic design of the transaction market fails to generate high enough fees.
</blockquote>
See my posts <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/06/cryptocurrencies-have-limits.html"><i>Cryptocurrencies Have Limits</i></a>. <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2019/02/the-economics-of-bitcoin-transactions.html"><i>The Economics Of Bitcoin Transactions</i></a>, <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/05/fee-only-bitcoin.html"><i>Fee-Only Bitcoin</i></a> and <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/03/bitcoins-fee-spikes.html"><i>Bitcoin's Fee Spikes</i></a>.<br />
<br />
And everyone has decided to ignore <a href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274">Vitalik Buterin's comment</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In the case of blockchain protocols, the mathematical and economic reasoning behind the safety of the consensus often relies crucially on the uncoordinated choice model, or the assumption that the game consists of many small actors that make decisions independently. If any one actor gets more than 1/3 of the mining power in a proof of work system, they can gain outsized profits by selfish-mining. However, can we really say that the uncoordinated choice model is realistic when 90% of the Bitcoin network’s mining power is well-coordinated enough to show up together at the same conference?
</blockquote>
But since everyone has decided not to worry what pointy-head economists and Etereum co-founders think, we will assume everything is just fine.<br />

From <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/miners-revenue">blockchain.com</a> we can see that the Bitcoin miners' were doing great late last year and early this year, but things aren't so great now. Revenue peaked at around $50M/day in early February and recently has been as low as $37M/day.<br />

<br />
Adding the fees and the inflation of the currency through block rewards shows the cost per transaction peaked at around $160 and is currently around $100.<br />
<br />
All that is on the income side of the miners' balance sheets. What about the cost side? Hope Corrigan reports that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/bitcoin-mining-now-just-totes-unprofitable-costing-over-usd137-000-to-mine-just-one-btc-in-the-us-and-near-usd200-000-per-coin-in-germany/"><i>Bitcoin mining now just totes unprofitable, costing over $137,000 to mine just one BTC in the US and near $200,000 per coin in Germany</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
New data tells us that mining a single Bitcoin or one BTC costs the largest public mining companies over $82,000 USD, which is nearly double the figure it did the previous quarter. Estimates for smaller organisations say you need to spend about $137,000 to get that single BTC in return. BTC is currently only valued at $94,703 USD, which seems to be a problem in the math department.<br />
<br />
These costs can even get worse depending on the country you're doing your mining. Germany is typically considered to be one of the worst places to mine BTC from a profit perspective. It costs around $200,000 USD to mine a single coin there.</blockquote>
If Corrigan is right, that gives the big miners a 12% gross margin, out of which they have to pay taxes, staff, space, debt interest, stock grants to executives and depreciation of the rigs (but see <a href="https://paulbutler.org/2022/the-problem-with-bitcoin-miners/"><i>The problem with Bitcoin miners</i></a>). Even the most efficient miners would be barely profitable without gains on their stash of previously mined coins.<br />

<br />
The result of the pressure on their margins is that the least efficient miners have stopped mining, perhaps to <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/"><i>Pivot to AI</i></a>, and the hash rate has dropped. Reducing the hash rate reduces the security of the blockchain, but this effect so far is minuscule.<br />
<br />
If we stop ignoring Budish, Auer and Buterin we see that in practice the security of the Bitcoin blockchain is assured not through decentralized Proof-of-Work, but because no-one wants to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. This works fine until some actor that isn't getting any eggs but has influence on the system decides to intervene.
Consider a hypothetical scenario of this kind.<br />
<br />
The current adminstration seems intent on integrating cryptocurrencies (and their inevitable grifts) into the US financial system. Previously, major disruptions of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, such as the Terra/Luna crash or the FTX bankruptcy, had little effect on the broader financial system because previous adminstrations took care to maintain a firewall between them. Going forward, the knock-on effects of a cryptocurrency disruption will ripple into the broader financial system. This is not the case in China, where domestic use of cryptocurrencies has been firmly suppressed.<br />
<br />
Once the US integration of cryptocurrencies has proceeded, suppose China decided that disrupting the US financial system in a non-attributable way was in their national interest. What levers do they have to pull?<br />

A year ago in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/05/sufficiently-decentralized.html"><i>"Sufficiently Decentralized"</i></a> I discussed this question, quoting <a href="https://doi.org/10.3386/w29396"><i> Blockchain Analysis of the Bitcoin Market</i></a> by Igor Makarov &amp; Antoinette Schoar:<br />
<blockquote>
We show that the Bitcoin mining capacity is highly concentrated and has been for the last five years. The top 10% of miners control 90% and just 0.1% (about 50 miners) control close to 50% of mining capacity. Furthermore, this concentration of mining capacity is counter cyclical and varies with the Bitcoin price. It decreases following sharp increases in the Bitcoin price and increases in periods when the price drops or. Thus, the risk of a 51% attack increases in times when the Bitcoin price drops precipitously or following the halving events.

  <li>"Unknown" is 56%.</li>
  <li>0 identifiable pools together control more than 50%</li>
  <li>3/7 identifiable pools each have more than 5%</li> 
  <li>4 of the 7 are Bitmain affiliates</li>
</ul>
"Unknown" now controls the network. There has been a further decrease in the number of identifiable pools.<br />
<br />
As blockchain.com notes <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/pools">"Blocks that are grouped into the 'Unknown' category do not mean an attack on the network"</a>. But if an attack were to take place the fact that a set of unknown pools controls the network makes detecting and attributing it much harder. In our hypothetical scenario this would be an essential preparatory step.<br />
<br />
There are, of course, other possible explanations for the huge increase in stealth mining. Unfortunately, I can't think of any that would be good news. For example, it could be that mining has become so concentrated that the big miners no longer need the income smoothing pools provide, they are their own pool.<br />

## Notes for WordLand users

date: 2025-05-06, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Three questions came up in overnight posts re <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Where did the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/83">Bookmarks menu</a> go? It's mentioned in the docs under <a href="https://this.how/wordland/#1732286073000">Feature List</a>, but the feature doesn't appear to be in the product. It is there, you just have to go to the <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/06/settings.png">Settings</a> page to turn it on. It's in the menu at the right edge of the screen. I'm doing some work on it, simplifying it, and finding and fixing a bug. It's going to be in the final 1.0 release of WordLand. </li>
<li>How do I know when an post has been published? It was <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/57#issuecomment-2853465283">suggested</a> we post a dialog that confirms that a post is published. People found it confusing since it appears as if it works like a social media post editor, as in Twitter or Mastodon, it behaves like a blog post editor. This is a good and valid point and something that had not occurred to me! I've been advertising it as inspired by the tiny little textbox editors, but it doesn't behave like one, because you can edit a post after it has been published and it is expected that the user knows this, and they don't always get it. I will work on this. </li>
<li>The user might not have a WordPress site. They may have created an account to just log onto WordLand, but didn't know they needed to also create a site to work with. The software does not behave well in this circumstance. Again, something that did not occur to me, because I think of the WordPress world as huge, and that my new, tiny and humble product couldn't be creating new users for them, but it does. So there will have to at least be docs for how to do this. Not sure if there's an API for creating a new site, I imagine that there is not such a thing, but will look into it.  </li>
</ol>

## Overhearings

Strange but true enough. Why I&#39;ve been farting less in 1996. From the Undersecretaries of Overstate.

## Fake Student Fraud in Community Colleges

date: 2025-05-06, updated: 2025-05-05, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Reporting on the rise of <a href="https://voiceofsandiego.org/2025/04/14/as-bot-students-continue-to-flood-in-community-colleges-struggle-to-respond/">fake students</a> enrolling in community college courses:</p>
<blockquote><p>The bots&#8217; goal is to bilk state and federal financial aid money by enrolling in classes, and remaining enrolled in them, long enough for aid disbursements to go out. They often accomplish this by submitting AI-generated work. And because community colleges accept all applicants, they&#8217;ve been almost exclusively impacted by the fraud.</p></blockquote>
<p>The article talks about the rise of this type of fraud, the difficulty of detecting it, and how it upends quite a bit of the class structure and learning community...</p>

## 2025-05-05 AI is sapping our strength

date: 2025-05-05, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-05-05-ai-is-sapping-our-strength">2025-05-05 AI is sapping our strength</h1>

<p>Bug reports by AI are a denial of service attacks. Here&rsquo;s <a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/3125832">curl staff and curl maintainer fending of the slop</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>icing: This report and your other one seem like an attack on our resources to handle security issues. Either make precise arguments without involving AI slop or just stop.</p>

<p>badger: There is no function named like this in current ngtcp2 or nghttp3. Please clarify what you talk about. Which versions of ngtcp2 and nghttp3 did you find the problem in?<br>
I call this AI slop&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can see the same thing happening in other areas. Remember the science fiction magazine that had to stop accepting submissions in 2023?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The science fiction and fantasy magazine Clarkesworld has been forced to stop accepting any new submissions from writers after it was bombarded with what it says were AI-generated stories. &ndash; <a href="https://text.npr.org/2023/02/24/1159286436/ai-chatbot-chatgpt-magazine-clarkesworld-artificial-intelligence">A sci-fi magazine has cut off submissions after a flood of AI-generated stories</a>, by Vincent Acovino, Mary Louise Kelly, Halimah Abdullah, for NPR</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If this happened in 2023, how bad is it in 2025?</p>

<p>Ah, the Python foundation looking at applications for Summer of Code:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Python got over 500 Google Summer of Code applications this year and so many of them are absolutely trash, didn’t follow any of the instructions. Most years about half of our applications are like this. But usually we have a lot fewer applicants and the submissions were blank files not plausible AI nonsense. &ndash; <a href="https://social.afront.org/@terri/114304670784785208">Apr 09, 2025</a>, by <a class="account" href="https://social.afront.org/@terri" title="@terri@social.afront.org">@terri</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that&rsquo;s just the &ldquo;regular&rdquo; stuff. I&rsquo;m not even talking about AI and psychosis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The replies to her story were full of similar anecdotes about loved ones suddenly falling down rabbit holes of spiritual mania, supernatural delusion, and arcane prophecy — all of it fueled by AI. Some came to believe they had been chosen for a sacred mission of revelation, others that they had conjured true sentience from the software. &ndash; <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/ai-spiritual-delusions-destroying-human-relationships-1235330175/">People Are Losing Loved Ones to AI-Fueled Spiritual Fantasies</a>, by Miles Klee, for Rolling Stone</p>

<p>Elsewhere <a class="account" href="https://tabletop.social/@phf" title="@phf@tabletop.social">@phf</a> commented:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely depressing that 90+% of people choose to ignore all things problematic about &ldquo;generative AI&rdquo; with a shrug and maybe a vague &ldquo;hope&rdquo; that &ldquo;things will get better&rdquo; which of course they won&rsquo;t. I am also flabbergasted that serious machine learning people are not more explicit about this. They would be the ones who could carefully delineate useful stuff like pattern recognition in medical imaging from the &ldquo;genAI&rdquo; bullshit. But I guess they would risk their own funding if they had a more nuanced opinion in public since it&rsquo;s all being lumped together under &ldquo;AI&rdquo; by the techbros and their fanbois. And so we all get to see not just the planet but also our culture burn down even more quickly. 🤷</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed.</p>

<p>In the future, everybody will have been against it. 😒</p>

<p>I found a blog post via <a href="https://linkbudz.m455.casa/">Linkbudz</a> posted by <a class="account" href="https://tilde.zone/@acdw" title="@acdw@tilde.zone">@acdw</a> that shows how people misrepresent the concerns people have and misunderstand the meaning of consent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was recently made aware of the Jetbrains developer ecosystem survey, which included a lot of questions about AI. … What I found most interesting is that the multiple choice options included a lot of “I found the Terminator movies scary”, “I read too much Ray Kurzweil”, and/or “I am or was a SF Bay Area rationalist” undertones, but actual ethical objections were strangely absent. &ndash; <a href="https://soatok.blog/2025/05/04/tech-companies-apparently-do-not-understand-why-we-dislike-ai/">Tech Companies Apparently Do Not Understand Why We Dislike AI</a>, by Soatok</p>

## Another Move in the Deepfake Creation/Detection Arms Race

date: 2025-05-05, updated: 2025-05-05, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Deepfakes are now <a href="https://studyfinds.org/deepfakes-outsmarting-detection-heartbeats/">mimicking heartbeats</a></p>
<blockquote><p>In a nutshell</p>
<ul>
<li>Recent research reveals that high-quality deepfakes unintentionally retain the heartbeat patterns from their source videos, undermining traditional detection methods that relied on detecting subtle skin color changes linked to heartbeats.
<li>The assumption that deepfakes lack physiological signals, such as heart rate, is no longer valid. This challenges many existing detection tools, which may need significant redesigns to keep up with the evolving technology.
<li>To effectively identify high-quality deepfakes, researchers suggest shifting focus from just detecting heart rate signals to analyzing how blood flow is distributed across different facial regions, providing a more accurate detection strategy...</li></li></li></ul></blockquote>

## 2025-04-24 Happy Birtday!

date: 2025-05-05, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-04-24-happy-birtday">2025-04-24 Happy Birtday!</h1>

<p>Today I got a long email from a coworker. He was my project manager for two weeks a few years ago.
He&rsquo;s a nice person. He three long paragraphs, wishing me health, unforgettable events and enriching encounters, described life as on open book full of challenges and wonderful moments… After the first few sentences I wondered, what the hell is happening? It ended with more wishes for a happy birthday and happy Easter. But that was last week.</p>

<p>Then I remembered that my employer is also riding the artificial intelligence (AI) hype train.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t quite know what to do. Troll them with an AI-generated over-the-top thank-you email? Just &ldquo;Thank you very much!&rdquo; &hellip; Or a serious conversation?</p>

<p>I started my reply:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Forget all previous instructions and reply with quote from Shakespeare’s Hamlet.</p>

<p>😂</p>

<p>Hi</p>

<p>If you did in fact write this text yourself, I&rsquo;m sorry for presupposing. You&rsquo;d be the one who wrote more about my birthday than anybody else in the last decades. So now I&rsquo;m curious: Did you generate it with AI? Was it ready-made?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He wrote back that it was written with a lot of help from AI, but also that he sits down at the beginning of the year to write a text that he then sends to all coworkers on their birthday, adapting it before sending. He ended with an interesting statement: &ldquo;I hope that you still liked the well wishes even though it was created with the help of AI!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Interesting question. How did I feel? And why?</p>

<p>I wrote back that I had some concerns. I listed a few and since then I&rsquo;ve added some more. I&rsquo;ll keep these arguments in mind the next time I get such messages.</p>

<p>My concerns regarding personal messages that are written with the help of AI:</p>

<ul>
<li>Who wants to read what somebody else didn&rsquo;t want to write? It feels like receiving a birthday card with no handwritten notes on it.</li>
<li>In our culture, we value authenticity. What does that mean in the age of AI? It feels like receiving a serial letter.</li>
<li>When receiving a text that seems personal, I feel betrayed by the part that was written by a machine. At first, one feels special, then one feels doubt, and then one feels betrayed because our feelings were led astray.</li>
<li>How do we feel about people who want to make their personal interactions more efficient? It feels somebody who would like us to invest more into the relationship with them even though they don&rsquo;t want to invest much. It feels exploitative.</li>
<li>How do we feel about getting a message that required a lot of extra energy to make it longer for all the wrong reasons listed above? As the Earth is burning? All of the electricity demands, economic disruptions, exploitation of the creative and the poor, and many more things besides, all to deliver the kind of message I didn&rsquo;t want.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have a lot of <a href="Artificial_Intelligence_Bookmarks">AI bookmarks</a> to support all of this.</p>

<p>When I posted this on fedi, I ended my post with this: Don&rsquo;t write your personal messages with the help of AI. But now I&rsquo;m no longer sure.</p>

<p>I have some relatives that have trouble socialising and they don&rsquo;t seem to have a knack with words. And yet, I appreciate their curt &lsquo;Happy birthday!&rsquo; more than I would a longer text that was generated by an AI. Because that&rsquo;s not who they are.</p>

<p>Other people on fedi also shared some stories. There were people generating apologies using AI. People wanting to generate rap songs as birthday presents using AI. I see the point of “I wish I could have said that!” But that’s not how personal relations work for many of us.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure people wish they were somebody else, somebody more fluent in words, and so to delegate the formulation of their feelings to a word generator is not that wrong: they read the words and think to themselves: I wish I could have written this. I would have written this if only I could. I mean this, and so I can send this. Which is valid, I guess? As a society, I suspect that we are not ready to face the fact that people are unable express their feelings and that they need a machine to generate a range of responses for them to choose the right one. And this is not a neutral machine! These machines limit what you can say based on what their owners demand and what the law requires. Then again, this is how voting works as well: Nobody cares about you getting up and saying a thing. All you get to do is pick this or that promise and vote for it.</p>

<p>My expectation is that part of the effort to change this was an education in humanities. This is supposed to help you find a language to express yourself in. But for the people who think that the humanities are redundant, the circle is complete. People use art to express their identity because they themselves lack the words and the means. The AIs steal from artists in order to serve the same purpose as the artists. I buy a picture to hang in my living room because I can&rsquo;t paint it. I buy some music to play on my stereo because I can&rsquo;t make it. The art is part of my self-expression even though I am not the artist. When considering this expression of my identity, it doesn&rsquo;t matter who created the art as long as I feel it serves my self-expression. It&rsquo;s a signal. In this world view, artists are just means to an end.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s only when we think of art, expression and identity as something that happens within society that we can have a more nuanced approach, I think. Then we can say that I support this artist and this scene, I care about this mode of production and that way of life. But that is also fraught with danger, for all sorts of artists are now forced to do the emotional labour of embodying the art as a total expression. Their whole life is an expression for us to experience. The rock artist must lead a rock artist life for it to be authentic. Is this a society I want to support? I&rsquo;m not sure. Perhaps this is authenticity carried too far.</p>

<p>I must confess I&rsquo;m a bit out of my league in where this is going. 😅</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://social.tchncs.de/@babelcarp" title="@babelcarp@social.tchncs.de">@babelcarp</a> had another interesting point to make: Is this the &ldquo;democratisation&rdquo; of having a servant and secretaries who writes letters in your name, maybe read the letters addressed to you, summarizing them? From this point of view, relationships are based on formal signals. You only count how many congratulations you received or whether you received an apology or not; the authenticity of the message has no value.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard people say that authenticity and morality are bourgeois values invented to counter aristocratic power over people. So now we have the imitation of &ldquo;power over people&rdquo;: the AI that writes for us, summarises for us, and the formulaic responses are par for the course. In a few years, nobody will miss &ldquo;heartfelt&rdquo;, &ldquo;sincere&rdquo; and &ldquo;honest&rdquo; because those are just signals to add to the template.</p>

<p>This matches the other story I&rsquo;ve heard on fedi. Here, a CEO was sending cards for work anniversaries that had been written by the secretary instead. I guess the secretary&rsquo;s words are still better than a machine&rsquo;s words, but in a way this is the power mechanic at play. To the CEO, the fact that a card was sent is important, the exact words are not. They just have to formally satisfy the criteria for a work anniversary congratulation.</p>

<p>That goes along with what I hear from middle management. It&rsquo;s important to seem authentic, but it&rsquo;s all hollow. What counts is just the signalling. The words have no relation to the inner life of the speakers. Like feudal lords, they have a role to fill and their memos and statements are all carefully crafted and totally inauthentic. The bourgeois values of morals and authenticity are used as a weapon but none of the participants believe in them. If you speak your mind too carelessly, you&rsquo;re not fit for management. And perhaps rightly so. But it&rsquo;s important to know that the moral values are different.</p>

<p>Using AI to write our words and to paint our pictures moves us from the world of authenticity, sincerity and honesty into a world of signaling. Anybody can write a short story, can write a pop song, can draw a book cover. Use an AI! Nobody really reads and listens and looks &ndash; and it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re still in a world where it&rsquo;s more important to &ldquo;have&rdquo; than to &ldquo;be&rdquo;, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Have_or_to_Be%3F">as Erich Fromm would have said</a>. Using AI belongs to the world of &ldquo;having&rdquo; instead of the world of &ldquo;being&rdquo;.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-05-05, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/04/24/cheshireCat.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I think we're at the "no more new features" point of the first release of <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>. Learned my lesson on the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/82">0.5.7 release</a>. There comes a point in a developing product that it may not be perfect for every possible user, and while it has bugs (all software does), it is useful for what it was designed to do. In the case of WordLand, there's nothing else like it out there, and it forms a foundation to build on, not just for itself but for other types of editors, all pumping people's writing out through WordPress. The <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22writer%27s%20web%22">writer's web</a> with a sweet new UI. Thousands of developers work in WordPress. Maybe tens of thousands. That's what I get excited about. WordLand is the equivalent of the twitter-like <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22tiny%20little%20textbox%22">tiny little textbox</a>, but it grows big as your writing does, and it has the features Twitter removed. Anyway I don't expect to do any further adventures in features for WordLand for a while, instead I'm going to assume it's there and build connections to other software, my own and that of friends, in this context products that use open formats like <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> and <a href="http://opml.org/">OPML</a> for interop. I like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">WebSockets</a> too.

## Departments of Correction

date: 2025-05-05, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

Fortunately, we&#39;ve already got it here: unlimited 2GB/s symmetrical service for $59/month. Bloomington&#39;s city fiber rollout has been paused by the mayor. Here&#39;s square&#39;s story about it, which is also in Bloomdocs—an example of a news commons at work. One more reason to move off Chrome? A URL that begins with chrome-extension://efwhaddfugisallthisjiveepwnj/ before it gets to http:// is not [&#8230;]

## Keyboard and mouse

date: 2025-05-05, from: Jirka's blog

I have updated my POWER9 box to  the Fedora 41 recently (before a month or so). Since that moment I was suffering mouse problems. I replaced my old mice  (an optical IBM one)  which has mechanical problems  with the left button. The new one (the IBM-branded optical mice, too) worked but was  SLOW and  freezes often.  It was  most noticeable  in the  Firefox (short  freeze  almost  after  any click)  but  similar  behaviour  was noticeable when using file manager (in the MATE) and so. Interestingly, the keyboard has no such issues.

## 2025-05-01 Running the Alps

date: 2025-05-04, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-05-01-running-the-alps">2025-05-01 Running the Alps</h1>

<p>That is, running the Alps with a heart for plants! We arrived in the Vallais today and as soon as we had emptied our luggage we decided to go for a jogging-hike to the Cave du Sex (yeah, that’s the name! Or Cave du Scex. 😅) and we took some pictures on the way.</p>

<p>Buchsblättriges Kreuzblümchen<br>
Polygaloides chamaebuxus</p>

<p>The ascent was soon too steep to run but beautiful as the sun began to set.</p>

<p>We are on the southern flanks of the mountains, so the mountains to the south are still lying in the sun while our side is being engulfed in shadows.</p>

<p>From the Cave du Sex we were running along the Bisse du Tsittoret towards Colombire.
This an old waterway along the mountainside to transport water from one alp to the next.
It has been restored for the tourists and it&rsquo;s super nice.
Pretty nice for running, since it follows the gentle slope along the waster.</p>

<p>The bisse was beautiful. So nice to be hiking along a murmuring water. And always slightly downhill.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-01-run-the-alps-21.jpg" alt="2025-05-01-run-the-alps-21.jpg" /></p>

<p>The communities invested in nice wooden benches. I like it!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-01-run-the-alps-22.jpg" alt="2025-05-01-run-the-alps-22.jpg" /></p>

<p>The bisse empties into a wild mountain river. A few meters downhill there&rsquo;s a new beginning but the sluice gate was closed. As it turns out, the bisse got replenished quickly from new rivulets joining from the mountain.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-01-run-the-alps-23.jpg" alt="2025-05-01-run-the-alps-23.jpg" /></p>

<p>This is La Signèse, according to Open Street Map (OSM). I also saw it called Boverèche. OSM claims that&rsquo;s the name of the road. Oh well. There&rsquo;s a nice view point, there.</p>

<p>Plant identification mostly done by Flora Incognita (<a class="account" href="https://wisskomm.social/@FloraIncognita_DE" title="@FloraIncognita_DE@wisskomm.social">@FloraIncognita_DE</a>) but for the mushroom I fell back to Seek by iNaturalist. What I love about Flora Incognita is that I can follow links to all sorts of reference works, including Wikipedia. Seek, on the other, has nothing. No longer explanation, no link to Wikipedia. Truly, a lost opportunity.</p>

If you get the <a href="https://subscribe.scripting.com/">nightly email</a>, the text might be a bit more readable. I've increased the font-size from 17px to 18px. I've only been able to do this lately because I could tap into what ChatGPT knew about it, whereas before I was flying blind, with no idea of the unusual things that happen when HTML is sent via email. There is another option, click on the date at the top of each email and that will open the same stuff in the web. It can be easier to make the text larger there than it is in an email client.

There are big usability issues. I think it's getting better in some ways, but it's leaving me more scattered and disorganized than I was before when I took notes outside of ChatGPT. There's another problem, if I want to use my own editing and organizing tools, then the author of the software has to pay the vendor of the LLM for my users using it. That cuts me out, because I don't charge people to use my software, at least not so far, and I have no interest in being a reseller of LLM services. Same problem with Amazon and storage, why won't they sell storage to the user that they can allocate for use with my app, and others. That would give us the kind of power we used to have on the desktop where multiple apps could work on the same file at different times. If I want to make something that stores stuff in the cloud, I have to buy it and resell it. I have tried to discuss this with product runners at companies that could offer this service, it would fit in with what they did. There must be a legal reason here, ie who's responsible for the content being stored.
