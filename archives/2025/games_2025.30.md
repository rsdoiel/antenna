## Where to find grass seeds in Grounded 2

date: 2025-07-29, updated: 2025-07-28, from: Polygon Website

Finding grass seeds in Grounded 2 is essential for getting the Omni-Tool&#8217;s shovel attachment, which you&#8217;ll need for scooping up clay and grubs, among many other things. The trouble is that Grounded 2 treats finding certain resources like an environmental puzzle and assumes you&#8217;re going to look for the location in the right way without [&#8230;]

## Grounded 2 tries the same trick twice, but at least you can ride the bugs this time

date: 2025-07-29, updated: 2025-07-28, from: Polygon Website

I only played the original Grounded for a short spell in 2020, but I remember it well. It was mere months into the COVID-19 pandemic and my friends were desperate for new games to try as an excuse to socialize. Thanks to its launch on Xbox Game Pass, we decided to get a group together [&#8230;]

## The first great Switch 2 mouse game might be a revived 33-year-old classic

date: 2025-07-29, updated: 2025-07-29, from: Polygon Website

The Nintendo Switch 2’s new features include Joy-Cons that can become a mouse. I’ve personally been wondering which game will allow us to take full advantage of mouse controls, and now I know: Mario Paint. If you’ve been looking for an excuse to get artsy, then this 33-year-old classic game, now available for Nintendo Switch [&#8230;]

## Can Roggenrola be shiny in Pokémon Go?

date: 2025-07-29, updated: 2025-07-29, from: Polygon Website

Roggenrola, the mantle Pokémon from Unova, can be found in the wild in Pokémon Go. Yes, Roggenrola can be shiny in Pokémon Go! Roggenrola’s shiny debuted during its very own Roggenrola Community Day in September 2022. Gigalith is a pretty decent rock-type attacker, but it has become massively outclassed since its Community Day. You’re better [&#8230;]

## Sony sues Tencent over Horizon Zero Dawn ‘rip-off’

date: 2025-07-28, updated: 2025-07-28, from: Polygon Website

Seven months ago, Tencent, the world’s biggest gaming company, revealed a new project: Light of Motiram, a futuristic open-world game from studio Polaris Quest where machines rule the land. If that sounds familiar, the actual trailer and its cybernetic animals only further implied a specific inspirational source: Sony and Guerrilla Games’ Horizon series. Now Sony [&#8230;]

## Visa and Mastercard are getting overwhelmed by gamer fury over censorship

date: 2025-07-28, updated: 2025-07-28, from: Polygon Website

In the wake of storefronts like Steam and itch.io curbing the sale of adult games, irate fans have started an organized campaign against the payment processors that they believe are responsible for the crackdown. While the movement is still in its early stages, people are mobilizing with an eye toward overwhelming communication lines at companies [&#8230;]

## Tales of the Shire falls short of the LOTR Animal Crossing promise

date: 2025-07-28, updated: 2025-07-28, from: Polygon Website

On paper, a cozy little game set in the Shire sounds like a slam dunk. The Shire is canonically a beautiful, peaceful, inviting little place, and a game that lets you customize your own personal Hobbit hole sounds delightful. But in practice, Weta Workshop&#8217;s new life sim, Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of [&#8230;]

## Avatar: Fire and Ash’s first trailer shows war between the Na’vi

James Cameron’s Avatar series has nothing to do with Avatar: The Last Airbender, but the franchise is following a similar path by going on a tour of the elements. After the first movie involved former Marine Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) conquering the skies and Avatar: The Way of Water took him and his family into [&#8230;]

## Where is Tophat Gudetama this week in Hello Kitty Island Adventure?

Tophat Gudetama hides in a different spot in Hello Kitty Island Adventure every week, with new weeks beginning on Monday. Pochacco will task you with finding this dapper Gudetama specifically as part of a quest per week for the first two weeks (“The Laziest Egg” and “The Laziest Eggs”), though after you finish these, there [&#8230;]

## Every big SDCC 2025 announcement in one place

date: 2025-07-28, updated: 2025-07-28, from: Polygon Website

The 2025 edition of San Diego Comic-Con was relatively muted: Marvel skipped Hall H in favor of releasing The Fantastic Four: First Steps in all its standalone-thrills-but-pivotal-end-credits-scene glory while James Gunn only popped by to promote Peacemaker season 2, but nothing more from his larger Warner Bros./DCU initiative. But the absence of two major players [&#8230;]

## Donkey Kong Bananza&#8217;s identity crisis doesn&#8217;t get in the way of good time

date: 2025-07-28, updated: 2025-07-25, from: Polygon Website

I&#8217;m not surprised smashing stuff in Donkey Kong Bananza is enjoyable. In the tutorial alone, I, like many others, spent ages demolishing everything I could get my (giant gorilla) hands on, and it&#8217;s a given that something designed well enough to distract from the main attraction like that is still going to feel good 10 [&#8230;]

## Lord of Mysteries is the closest we might get to Bloodborne 2

Ten years after Bloodborne&#8216;s release, its fans are still exploring the game and finding new secrets, while stubbornly waiting waiting for a sequel. I also wish for more stories about old secrets and the dreams of hunters. The hopes for a possible sequel only make me more eager to get in touch with anything that [&#8230;]

## K-Pop Demon Hunters and Star Wars Jedi is the crossover we never knew we needed

If someone had told me that my most recent hyperfixation, the Netflix phenomenon known as KPop Demon Hunters, would cross with my oldest, most beloved wire mother known as Star Wars, I’d have been very skeptical. After all, what could Cal Kestis, Bode Akuna, and Merrin from the Jedi games possibly have in common with [&#8230;]

## Sorry, Mario, Nintendo&#8217;s got a new working-class hero

date: 2025-07-27, updated: 2025-07-25, from: Polygon Website

After becoming super, Mario seems to have pulled the ladder up behind him. Our hometown blue-collar boy made it good in the Mushroom Kingdom&#8217;s highest strata, ditching the plumber&#8217;s gig for a plush life as Princess Peach&#8217;s royal favorite (whatever that may or may not entail). He and his bro are set for life, so [&#8230;]

## Steam&#8217;s mechanical new puzzle game has taken over my brain

The other day I was on my way to get drinks with some friends after work, but in my head, I was still at work. I had just spent a 45-minute subway ride with my nose buried in my Steam Deck playing Kaizen: A Factory Story. Set in 1980s Japan, the inventive new project from [&#8230;]

Samantha Béart is obviously not a seven-foot-tall Barbarian in real life, but the actor says they do share some personality traits with one.&#160; Béart is perhaps best known for their role as Karlach in Baldur&#8217;s Gate 3 — the flammable, lovable Tiefling who became one of the most-romanced characters in the game.

## Every tease Marvel still needs to pay off, in theory

date: 2025-07-27, updated: 2025-07-27, from: Polygon Website

Over the past 17 years, Marvel Studios has focused as much on the continuity of its ongoing mega-story as it’s focused on the content of any given superhero film. The 23-film Infinity Saga was never just about individual movie narratives — it was about the buildup to Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, the two-part [&#8230;]
