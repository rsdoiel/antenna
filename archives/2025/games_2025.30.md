## Every big SDCC 2025 announcement in one place

date: 2025-07-28, updated: 2025-07-28, from: Polygon Website

The 2025 edition of San Diego Comic-Con was relatively muted: Marvel skipped Hall H in favor of releasing The Fantastic Four: First Steps in all its standalone-thrills-but-pivotal-end-credits-scene glory while James Gunn only popped by to promote Peacemaker season 2, but nothing more from his larger Warner Bros./DCU initiative. But the absence of two major players [&#8230;]

## Donkey Kong Bananza&#8217;s identity crisis doesn&#8217;t get in the way of good time

date: 2025-07-28, updated: 2025-07-25, from: Polygon Website

I&#8217;m not surprised smashing stuff in Donkey Kong Bananza is enjoyable. In the tutorial alone, I, like many others, spent ages demolishing everything I could get my (giant gorilla) hands on, and it&#8217;s a given that something designed well enough to distract from the main attraction like that is still going to feel good 10 [&#8230;]

## Lord of Mysteries is the closest we might get to Bloodborne 2

date: 2025-07-27, updated: 2025-07-25, from: Polygon Website

Ten years after Bloodborne&#8216;s release, its fans are still exploring the game and finding new secrets, while stubbornly waiting waiting for a sequel. I also wish for more stories about old secrets and the dreams of hunters. The hopes for a possible sequel only make me more eager to get in touch with anything that [&#8230;]

## K-Pop Demon Hunters and Star Wars Jedi is the crossover we never knew we needed

date: 2025-07-27, updated: 2025-07-25, from: Polygon Website

If someone had told me that my most recent hyperfixation, the Netflix phenomenon known as KPop Demon Hunters, would cross with my oldest, most beloved wire mother known as Star Wars, I’d have been very skeptical. After all, what could Cal Kestis, Bode Akuna, and Merrin from the Jedi games possibly have in common with [&#8230;]

## Sorry, Mario, Nintendo&#8217;s got a new working-class hero

date: 2025-07-27, updated: 2025-07-25, from: Polygon Website

After becoming super, Mario seems to have pulled the ladder up behind him. Our hometown blue-collar boy made it good in the Mushroom Kingdom&#8217;s highest strata, ditching the plumber&#8217;s gig for a plush life as Princess Peach&#8217;s royal favorite (whatever that may or may not entail). He and his bro are set for life, so [&#8230;]

## Steam&#8217;s mechanical new puzzle game has taken over my brain

date: 2025-07-27, updated: 2025-07-25, from: Polygon Website

The other day I was on my way to get drinks with some friends after work, but in my head, I was still at work. I had just spent a 45-minute subway ride with my nose buried in my Steam Deck playing Kaizen: A Factory Story. Set in 1980s Japan, the inventive new project from [&#8230;]

## Karlach&#8217;s actor is just as obsessed with her as you are

date: 2025-07-27, updated: 2025-07-25, from: Polygon Website

Samantha Béart is obviously not a seven-foot-tall Barbarian in real life, but the actor says they do share some personality traits with one.&#160; Béart is perhaps best known for their role as Karlach in Baldur&#8217;s Gate 3 — the flammable, lovable Tiefling who became one of the most-romanced characters in the game. The UK-based actor [&#8230;]

## Every tease Marvel still needs to pay off, in theory

date: 2025-07-27, updated: 2025-07-27, from: Polygon Website

Over the past 17 years, Marvel Studios has focused as much on the continuity of its ongoing mega-story as it’s focused on the content of any given superhero film. The 23-film Infinity Saga was never just about individual movie narratives — it was about the buildup to Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, the two-part [&#8230;]
