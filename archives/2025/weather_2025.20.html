Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0255 PM CDT Fri May 23 2025

Valid 232000Z - 241200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE CENTRAL
AND SOUTHERN GREAT PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated to scattered severe thunderstorms are expected across parts
of the southern and central Plains this afternoon through the
overnight hours, with large hail and severe wind gusts the main
threats. Isolated very large hail greater than 2 inches in diameter
may occur.

...20Z Updates...
Only minor changes to the MRGL risk area in southeast Colorado where
dewpoints have held in the upper 50s F. The outlook is otherwise
unchanged. See the previous discussion for greater details.

..Wendt.. 05/23/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1137 AM CDT Fri May 23 2025/

...Central High Plains to Kansas/Oklahoma/Ozarks...
Multiple low-amplitude mid-level shortwave troughs will progress
east-southeastward from the southern/central Rockies across the
adjacent High Plains by this evening. Corresponding weak
cyclogenesis over the central High Plains will encourage modest
low-level moisture transport northward into parts of eastern
Colorado/western Kansas by peak afternoon heating. A narrow corridor
of sufficient destabilization, along with 35-45 kt of deep-layer
shear, should support organized convection.

Initial development over the central High Plains late this
afternoon, most likely across the Nebraska/Colorado/Kansas border
region, should become supercellular and pose a threat for large hail
and severe wind gusts as it spreads southeastward through the
evening. Given steep lapse rates aloft and elongated hodographs at
mid/upper levels, isolated very large hail may occur, with some
tornado risk as well. It remains unclear whether this convection
will grow upscale into a cluster across southern Kansas/northern
Oklahoma later in the evening/early overnight hours as a southerly
low-level jet gradually strengthens, or if separate clusters will
eventually develop as warm advection/moisture transport increases.
Regardless, the airmass across this region will be at least
moderately unstable, with sufficient deep-layer shear to support
continued updraft organization and a continued threat for hail and
damaging winds with convection that can persist east-southeastward
this evening/overnight across Kansas/Oklahoma and eventually the
Ozarks.

...Southern High Plains including Texas Panhandle/South Plains...
A subtle mid-level disturbance/speed max over New Mexico/southern
Colorado, as inferred from Water Vapor/Infrared satellite imagery,
may be an influence on late-day severe storm development. At least
isolated to widely scattered high-based thunderstorm development
seems plausible near the dryline. While warm mid-level temperatures
exist, sufficient near-dryline confluence/convergence and ample
post-dry line mixing (surface temperatures reaching mid/upper 90s F
with CAPE persisting atop the boundary layer in forecast soundings)
should be sufficient for the initiation of sustained deep
convection. Especially with some expected increase in mid-level
westerlies late today, wind profiles/moderate buoyancy will support
high-based supercells capable of large hail, with damaging winds
also possible, particularly across the Texas South Plains given the
well-mixed environment.

...Florida...
To the south of a remnant front, at least scattered thunderstorms
should develop this afternoon across parts of the southeast Florida
Peninsula. This activity should preferentially form on/near the
Atlantic Coast sea breeze. While mid-level winds are not forecast to
be overly strong, sufficient instability and vertical shear should
exist for modest updraft organization. Any cells/clusters that
develop could produce isolated hail and/or damaging winds. For
additional short-term details, see Mesoscale Discussion 939.

...Southern Louisiana...
A moist/very unstable environment near a northward-returning
old/near-coastal front may be conducive to a very isolated damaging
wind and marginally severe hail risk this afternoon through around
sunset.

Mesoscale Discussion 0941
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0249 PM CDT Fri May 23 2025

Areas affected...The Trans-Pecos and Stockton Plateau of West Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 231949Z - 232145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A few severe wind gusts and marginally severe hail stones
will be possible across portions of the Trans-Pecos and Stockton
Plateau through late this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Convective temperatures have easily been reached under
a mid-level ridge axis this afternoon along and ahead of a dryline
beginning to mix eastward into portions of West TX. Visible
satellite and radar imagery both indicate moist convection is
deepening east of the Davis Mountains, where a well mixed boundary
layer is in place. An unstable air mass should continue to result in
isolated to widely scattered thunderstorm development through the
afternoon. The main concern with this activity will be severe wind
gusts given large dewpoint-temperature spreads/inverted V profiles,
and downdraft CAPE ~2000 J/kg. This may especially be true by late
this afternoon if storm mergers occur. Severe hail also cannot be
ruled out with steep mid level lapse rates in place and a slight
increase in mid to upper-level flow anticipated over the next couple
of hours. However, the threat of severe hail may be mitigated by
high freezing levels and a lack of significant organization due to
limiting deep layer effective shear. A weather watch is not expected
at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 0940
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0153 PM CDT Fri May 23 2025

Areas affected...parts of southeastern Wyoming...southwestern
Nebraska...northeastern Colorado...northwestern Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 231853Z - 232130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorm activity will begin to initiate to
the east of the Front Range during the next few hours, particularly
to the east/southeast of Cheyenne, with a couple of intensifying
supercells  posing increasing potential for severe weather by late
afternoon. Trends are being monitored for a watch.

DISCUSSION...Stronger boundary-layer destabilization the past few
hours has been focused to the lee of the Front Range, in a corridor
from southeastern Wyoming through northeastern Colorado. 
Mixed-layer CAPE now appears to be increasing in excess of 1000-1500
J/kg, and notable 2-hourly surface pressure falls on the order of
2-3 mb have recently been observed across the Akron CO through
Cheyenne WY vicinity.

Deepening convective development is ongoing across the higher
terrain, particularly in a narrow plume near the Colorado/Wyoming
state border to the west of Cheyenne.  As inhibition continues to
weaken with further insolation, perhaps aided by a subtle mid-level
perturbation developing to the east of the Front Range, thunderstorm
initiation appears increasingly probable through 20-22Z.

Both HREF and NCEP SREF indicate highest calibrated thunderstorm
probabilities initially focused along the southern slopes of the
Cheyenne Ridge (supported by current trends), before increasing
southeastward across northeast Colorado toward northwest Kansas.

Beneath modest (but strongly sheared) westerly deep-layer mean flow,
 a couple of supercells are likely to evolve while slowly
propagating eastward/southeastward into/across the high plains.  As
this occurs, it appears that thermodynamic profiles will become
increasingly conducive to large hail, locally damaging wind gusts,
and perhaps some risk for a brief/weak tornado.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0235 PM CDT Fri May 23 2025

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

A very dry boundary layer will remain in place across the Southwest
with poor relative humidity recoveries of less than 20 percent to
start Day 2/Saturday. Increasing middle and upper-level cloud cover
into the Southwest should attenuate boundary layer mixing, allowing
surface winds to largely remain below Critical thresholds. Elevated
highlights were maintained across eastern Arizona, southeastern
Utah/western Colorado and much of south-central/western New Mexico
where fuels remain receptive to fire spread.

..Williams.. 05/23/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0135 AM CDT Fri May 23 2025/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level wave will shift across the Southwest on Saturday.
Enhanced mid-level flow will largely pass overnight D1/Friday into
D2/Saturday, with relaxing pressure gradients through the day.
Though afternoon relative humidity will remain low (around 10
percent), this relaxing gradient will keep winds largely below
Critical values. In addition, an increase in mid-level cloud cover
is expected which may limit mixing. In more favored downslope
regions, locally stronger winds will be possible and support periods
of localized Critical fire weather. Overall, the broad Elevated
delineation was maintained where highest confidence in sustained
Elevated conditions were expected across eastern Arizona into
southeastern Utah and across south-central/western New Mexico.

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE SOUTHERN
PLAINS TO THE SOUTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
A severe threat is expected on Sunday afternoon and evening across
parts of the southern and central Plains. A threat for large hail,
wind damage and a couple tornadoes will be possible. A severe threat
is also expected in part of the Southeast.

...Plains...
Broad troughing over the Southwest will slowly shift eastward as
ridging aloft continue to remain strong across the northern half of
the CONUS. Shortwave ridging most of the day will favor relatively
warm temperatures at 700 mb (10-12 C) over much of the southern
plains, where rich low-level moisture will be present south of a
diffuse baroclinic zone across northern OK and the Mid MS Valley.
With a complicated surface pattern and modest ascent from the
western trough expected to arrive late in the afternoon/early
evening, significant uncertainty remains regarding the degree of the
severe threat Sunday.

Complications to the convective forecast abound from potential
outflow boundaries and remnant cloud debris from several days of
prior convection. Regardless, robust surface moisture (low 70s F
surface dewpoints) and strong diurnal heating should weaken the cap
sufficiently to support scattered thunderstorm development within
the warm sector from northern and central OK westward along the
surface trough/weak low and dryline in the TX Panhandle/western
north Texas. Supercell wind profiles are expected, with
intensification of the low-level flow likely into the evening. Given
the large buoyancy (3500+ J/kg of MLCAPE) large to very large hail
and damaging outflow winds are the most probable threats. An
isolated tornado is possible with any sustained supercells in the
evening with intensifying low-level wind fields and/or along any
aforementioned modified boundaries. Storms may continue to grow
upscale into one or more clusters into the evening and overnight
with a risk for damaging gusts and hail.

Weak, low-level upslope flow may support isolated thunderstorm
development Sunday from southeast CO into the western OK/TX
Panhandles. Lingering cloud cover and modest moisture suggest the
threat may be somewhat limited owing to weaker buoyancy. However,
some hail and damaging wind risk is possible with any clusters that
develop and spread eastward.

...Mid Mississippi Valley to the Southeast...
One or more elevated clusters of storms/MCS may be ongoing across
the eastern half of the southern Plains and Mid MS Valley at the
start of the forecast period. It is unclear, through possible, that
these storms will re-intensify and continue eastward along the
remnant baroclinic zone from the Mid MS Valley into the Southeast.
Possibly aided in part by ascent from a zonal jet and northern
stream shortwave trough over the Midwest, a broadly unstable air
mass will be favorable for additional storm
development/intensification. A damaging wind, hail and isolated
tornado risk may develop ahead of any clusters that
maintain/redevelop across parts of the MS Valley, continuing through
the Southeast most of Sunday. Additional scattered storm
development, with the potential for isolated damaging gusts or hail,
appears possible through much of the day within a broad warm air
advection regime over much of the Southeast.

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PORTIONS OF
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS TO THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND SOUTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe storms are likely across part of the southern Plains to the
Southeast Saturday. Severe wind gusts, large hail and a couple
tornadoes will be possible. Hailstones greater than 2 inches in
diameter could also occur. Isolated severe storms will also be
possible across parts of the central High Plains.

...Synopsis...
Amplified and split mid-level flow is expected across much of the
western and central CONUS D2/Saturday. A broad southern stream
trough will deepen over the Southwestern states while strong ridging
aloft intensifies farther north. Over the eastern US, a belt of
stronger mid-level flow will advance around the southern periphery
of an upper low over the Great lakes and Northeast. At the surface,
a weak lee low is expected across southeastern CO and western KS
with a partially modified warm front/composite outflow stretching
east/southeastward. Weak upslope flow is expected north of the
boundary across the central high plains, while  a trailing dryline
will slowly mix eastward into the southern High Plains and west
Texas with diurnal heating.

...Southern Plains to the MS Valley and Southeast...
A complex convective day is expected as a cluster of elevated storms
or a remnant MCS will likely be ongoing at the start of the period
from southern/southeastern KS into north-central/northeast OK.
Likely located along the aforementioned stalled front, these early
morning storms may reinforce the boundary as they continue
southeastward into the lower MS Valley. Destabilization ahead of,
and re-intensification of the cluster appears possible into parts of
the MS and TN Valleys Saturday afternoon, with moderate buoyancy and
sufficient deep-layer shear for an organized MCS. This would support
a risk for damaging gusts, hail and a tornado or two from eastern
OK, through the Ozarks and into the Southeast.

Across southern KS, OK and into the eastern TX Panhandle,
uncertainty remains high on the location of the convectively
reinforced outflow boundary and its impact on the warm sector. The
primary severe corridor is expected to be along and south of the
boundary and where it meets the surface low to the west. Rich
low-level moisture (70s F surface dewpoints) are expected by early
afternoon beneath steep mid-level lase rates of 8-9 C/km. While
forcing for ascent is not expected to be overly strong, owing to
weak shortwave ridging aloft, robust heating and 500 mb temperatures
near -10 C should allow for isolated convection to develop along and
south of the composite front/triple point. Moderate deep-layer shear
and very large buoyancy (4000-5000 J/kg of MLCAPE) would support
risk for supercells with very large hail and damaging gusts.

A conditional risk for couple of tornadoes may also develop as
backed low-level flow increases along the composite front.
Additional low-level hodograph expansion is expected into the
evening as the low-level jet (35-40 kt at 850 mb) is forecast to
increase across central and eastern OK. Upscale growth into one or
more clusters with the potential for wind damage also appears likely
into the overnight hours on Saturday and early D3/Sunday.

...West Texas...
Shortwave ridging ahead of the primary upper trough to the west will
result in neutral to slight mid-level height rises over much of the
High Plains and west TX Saturday. This suggests ascent will be
subtle with warm mid-level temperatures (H700 14C). The strong
capping, in combination with weak ascent, may limit robust
convective initiation along the dryline trailing from the surface
low. However, weak convergence and very warm surface temperatures
(near or exceeding 100F) may allow for isolated storms by late
afternoon. Should this occur,  25-30 kt of deep-layer shear could
support slow-moving supercells or clusters with a risk for hail, and
damaging outflow gusts.

...Central High Plains...
A narrow plume of surface moisture will extend westward across
eastern CO and the central High Plains with easterly upslope flow.
Widespread cloud cover and stratus is expected early, but some
clearing is possible as mixing increases through the day. Supported
by the upslope flow regime and subtle mid-level ascent from the
approaching Southwest US trough, isolated convection is possible
along the front Range and High plains by early afternoon. Moderate
buoyancy (1000-2000 J/kg of MLCAPE) and 25-40 kt of mid-level flow
could support storm organization with supercells or clusters. Hail
and damaging winds are most probable, though a tornado cannot be
ruled out given relatively strong low-level veering and
local-terrain influences.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1157 AM CDT Fri May 23 2025

Valid 231700Z - 241200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EAST-CENTRAL ARIZONA INTO
WEST-CENTRAL NEW MEXICO...

Dry southwest flow across much of the southwestern U.S. is expected
today. Greatest fire weather concern remains across the Mogollon Rim
and west-central New Mexico where southwest winds of 15-20 mph amid
single digit relative humidity and dry fuels overlap. No significant
changes to Elevated or Critical Highlights were needed across the
Southwest as previous forecast remains on track.

..Williams.. 05/23/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1254 AM CDT Fri May 23 2025/

...Synopsis...
Southwesterly flow aloft will increase ahead of an approaching wave
across southwestern US today, bringing an increase in southwest
surface winds. A very dry air mass and deeply mixed profiles will
support relative humidity reductions to around 10-15 percent (as low
as 5-10 percent) and sustained winds 15-20 mph across much Arizona
into New Mexico. Fuels along the Mogollon Rim in Arizona into
western New Mexico are receptive to fire spread, with ERCs near the
75th-90th percentile. As such, these are the areas where Critical
highlights have been maintained, with broader Elevated highlights
across much of eastern Arizona into western New Mexico. Elevated
conditions will also extend into eastern Utah and western Colorado.

1137 AM CDT Fri May 23 2025

Valid 231630Z - 241200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE CENTRAL
AND SOUTHERN GREAT PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated to scattered severe thunderstorms are expected across parts
of the southern and central Plains this afternoon through the
overnight hours, with large hail and severe wind gusts the main
threats. Isolated very large hail greater than 2 inches in diameter
may occur.

...Central High Plains to Kansas/Oklahoma/Ozarks...
Multiple low-amplitude mid-level shortwave troughs will progress
east-southeastward from the southern/central Rockies across the
adjacent High Plains by this evening. Corresponding weak
cyclogenesis over the central High Plains will encourage modest
low-level moisture transport northward into parts of eastern
Colorado/western Kansas by peak afternoon heating. A narrow corridor
of sufficient destabilization, along with 35-45 kt of deep-layer
shear, should support organized convection.

Initial development over the central High Plains late this
afternoon, most likely across the Nebraska/Colorado/Kansas border
region, should become supercellular and pose a threat for large hail
and severe wind gusts as it spreads southeastward through the
evening. Given steep lapse rates aloft and elongated hodographs at
mid/upper levels, isolated very large hail may occur, with some
tornado risk as well. It remains unclear whether this convection
will grow upscale into a cluster across southern Kansas/northern
Oklahoma later in the evening/early overnight hours as a southerly
low-level jet gradually strengthens, or if separate clusters will
eventually develop as warm advection/moisture transport increases.
Regardless, the airmass across this region will be at least
moderately unstable, with sufficient deep-layer shear to support
continued updraft organization and a continued threat for hail and
damaging winds with convection that can persist east-southeastward
this evening/overnight across Kansas/Oklahoma and eventually the
Ozarks.

...Southern High Plains including Texas Panhandle/South Plains...
A subtle mid-level disturbance/speed max over New Mexico/southern
Colorado, as inferred from Water Vapor/Infrared satellite imagery,
may be an influence on late-day severe storm development. At least
isolated to widely scattered high-based thunderstorm development
seems plausible near the dryline. While warm mid-level temperatures
exist, sufficient near-dryline confluence/convergence and ample
post-dry line mixing (surface temperatures reaching mid/upper 90s F
with CAPE persisting atop the boundary layer in forecast soundings)
should be sufficient for the initiation of sustained deep
convection. Especially with some expected increase in mid-level
westerlies late today, wind profiles/moderate buoyancy will support
high-based supercells capable of large hail, with damaging winds
also possible, particularly across the Texas South Plains given the
well-mixed environment.

...Florida...
To the south of a remnant front, at least scattered thunderstorms
should develop this afternoon across parts of the southeast Florida
Peninsula. This activity should preferentially form on/near the
Atlantic Coast sea breeze. While mid-level winds are not forecast to
be overly strong, sufficient instability and vertical shear should
exist for modest updraft organization. Any cells/clusters that
develop could produce isolated hail and/or damaging winds. For
additional short-term details, see Mesoscale Discussion 939.

...Southern Louisiana...
A moist/very unstable environment near a northward-returning
old/near-coastal front may be conducive to a very isolated damaging
wind and marginally severe hail risk this afternoon through around
sunset.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE SOUTHERN/CENTRAL PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated to scattered severe thunderstorms should develop across
parts of the southern and central Plains this afternoon through the
overnight hours, with large hail and severe gusts the main threats.
Isolated very large hail greater than 2 inches in diameter may
occur.

...Central/Southern Plains...
In the wake of overnight/early morning convection across parts of
central/south TX, low-level airmass recovery is anticipated today
across much of the southern/central Plains along and south of a
front. Only weak forcing aloft is forecast, as multiple
low-amplitude mid-level shortwave troughs progress
east-southeastward from the southern/central Rockies across the
adjacent High Plains by this evening. Corresponding weak
cyclogenesis over the central High Plains should encourage modest
low-level moisture transport northward into parts of eastern
CO/western KS by peak afternoon heating. A narrow corridor of
sufficient destabilization, along with generally 35-45 kt of
deep-layer shear, should support organized convection. 

Initial development over the central High Plains late this afternoon
should become supercellular and pose a threat for large hail and
severe gusts as it spreads southeastward through the evening. Given
steep lapse rates aloft and elongated hodographs at mid/upper
levels, isolated very large hail may occur. It remains unclear
whether this convection will grow upscale into a cluster across
southern KS/northern OK later in the evening/early overnight hours
as a southerly low-level jet gradually strengthens, or if a separate
cluster will eventually develop. Regardless, the airmass across this
region will be at least moderately unstable, with sufficient
deep-layer shear to support continued updraft organization and a
threat for hail and severe/damaging winds with whatever convection
that can persist this evening/overnight.

Across the southern High Plains, isolated to scattered high-based
thunderstorms may develop this afternoon along/east of the surface
dryline. Weak large-scale forcing and warm low/mid-level
temperatures limit confidence on overall thunderstorm coverage.
Still, any convection which can develop could pose an isolated
threat for severe hail/wind through the early evening before
weakening with the loss of daytime heating.

...Florida...
To the south of a remnant front, at least scattered thunderstorms
should develop this afternoon across parts of the southeast FL
Peninsula. This activity should preferentially form on/near the
Atlantic Coast sea breeze. While mid-level winds are not forecast to
be overly strong, sufficient instability and shear should exist for
modest updraft organization. Any cells/clusters that develop could
produce isolated hail and/or damaging winds.

...DISCUSSION...
...Monday/Day 4 to Wednesday/Day 6...
The medium-range models move a mid-level trough into the southern
and central Plains on Monday. Ahead of the trough, a moist airmass
is forecast from the southern Plains into the Gulf Coast states.
Scattered thunderstorms are expected across much of this airmass
Monday afternoon. The greatest convective coverage should be located
in parts of central and east Texas, where warm advection is forecast
to be maximized. Across the moist airmass, moderate instability will
likely be in place by midday. In addition, westerly flow associated
with the trough, should be strong enough for a severe threat. Large
hail and severe gusts will be possible as a cluster or line of
storms moves southeastward into central and east Texas during the
afternoon and evening.

On Tuesday, the moist airmass is forecast to remain in place from
the southern Plains eastward into the Gulf Coast states, with the
mid-level trough moving into the Ozarks. Model forecasts suggest
that numerous thunderstorms will develop ahead of the trough in
parts of the Southeast, with more isolated development occurring
across the southern Plains. Although a severe threat will be
possible across parts of this airmass, mesoscale processes will
determine the most favorable areas for severe. It appears that
instability will support isolated wind damage and hail, but
predictability appears low concerning the spatial distribution of
any isolated threat.

On Wednesday, the most unstable air is forecast from parts of
central and south Texas eastward into the lower Mississippi Valley.
Although large-scale ascent is forecast to be weak, thunderstorms
should develop in areas that warm up sufficiently along residual
outflow boundaries. An isolated severe threat should develop during
the mid to late afternoon, but predictability appears to be low.

...Thursday/Day 7 and Friday/Day 8...
On Thursday and Friday, westerly mid-level flow is forecast over the
southern U.S., where an unstable airmass is expected to remain in
place. As surface temperatures warm each day, isolated to scattered
thunderstorm development should take place. Although instability and
shear will be favorable for severe storms in a few areas,
predictability remains low.

In addition, on Friday convection will be possible ahead of a cold
front across parts of the Atlantic Seaboard. Enough instability
should be in place during the day for an isolated severe threat.
However, the spatial distribution of any potential threat appears to
have low predictability.

Mesoscale Discussion 0932
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0224 PM CDT Thu May 22 2025

Areas affected...parts of the Texas South Plains

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 221924Z - 222130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong to severe thunderstorm development,
perhaps including an evolving supercell or two, appears possible
through 3-5 PM CDT, accompanied by a risk for large hail and locally
damaging wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...Daytime heating and deep-boundary layer mixing focused
along the dryline across the Texas South Plains is contributing to
weakening inhibition as far north as a diffuse surface front
extending near/south of Childress toward the Lubbock vicinity.  This
is coinciding with deepening convective development, which seems
likely to persist, particularly where low-level convergence is
strongest near the boundary intersection.

Although beneath more modest northwesterly mid-level flow/deep-layer
shear than closer to the Red River, as updrafts acquire increasing
inflow of air characterized by mixed-layer CAPE as high as 2000-3000
J/kg, isolated supercell development posing a risk for large hail
and damaging wind gusts appear possible.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 312
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
305 PM CDT Thu May 22 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southwest and South-Central Oklahoma
  Western and North Texas

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 305 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 3 inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Severe storms including supercells are expected to
steadily develop through late afternoon, including across western
north Texas and southwest Oklahoma near a boundary from prior
storms, and also across the Texas South Plains. Storms may
eventually merge/cluster across parts of the Low Rolling Plains and
western North Texas. Potentially very large hail and severe-caliber
wind gusts are the primary hazards.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles north and south of a line from 65 miles east of
Wichita Falls TX to 55 miles north of Big Spring TX. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 311...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
3 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean storm motion vector
29025.

Mesoscale Discussion 0923
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0155 PM CDT Wed May 21 2025

Areas affected...parts of south central Nebraska into north central
Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 211855Z - 212130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A consolidating area of southeastward developing
thunderstorm activity may be accompanied by increasing strong to
severe wind gusts by 4-6 PM CDT.  It is not clear that a severe
weather watch is needed, but trends will be monitored.

DISCUSSION...Beneath seasonably cold (temperatures around/below -20
C at 500 mb) and strong (40-50 kt at 500 mb) west-northwesterly
mid-level flow, low-level lapse rates are becoming quite steep, with
sufficient boundary-layer moisture to support weak CAPE and
scattered developing thunderstorm activity across parts of south
central Nebraska and northeastern Colorado into northwestern Kansas.
 It appears that convection will continue to gradually increase and
modestly intensify with further destabilization through late
afternoon.  

Aided by large-scale forcing for ascent associated with a
southeastward developing area of lower/mid-tropospheric warm
advection, various model output suggests that convection may
gradually grow upscale into a cluster across the central
Nebraska/Kansas border vicinity through 21-23Z.  Coinciding with
peak daytime heating, and deep boundary-layer mixing (including
surface temperature/dew point spreads around 35-40F), strong
downdrafts, enhanced by evaporative cooling and downward mixing of
momentum, may contribute to a few locally severe surface gusts. 
Gradually, consolidating outflow may yield an expanding area of
strong to, perhaps, severe gusts, before convection wanes this
evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 0908
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0333 PM CDT Tue May 20 2025

Areas affected...Eastern Arkansas to the Tennessee River Valley

Concerning...Tornado Watch 303...305...

Valid 202033Z - 202230Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 303, 305 continues.

SUMMARY...The threat for large hail and tornadoes continues across
watches 303 and 305, though the potential for widespread damaging
winds is expected to increase over the next 2-3 hours across for
parts of northwest TN and far southwest KY. The greatest
hail/tornado threat will likely be focused across southeast AR into
northeast MS and parts of middle TN.

DISCUSSION...Numerous supercells continue to mature across eastern
AR with more isolated to scattered coverage across northern MS into
western/middle TN. Convective coverage/close storm proximity has
resulted in destructive interactions of the past hour across
northeast AR, and recent velocity imagery from KNQA shows signs of
consolidating outflow across northeast AR. This suggests that the
early stages of upscale growth is occurring and may promote an
increasing damaging/severe wind threat downstream into parts of
western TN and west/southwest KY. Strong low-level shear sampled by
the KQNA VWP hints that even with this storm mode transition,
embedded circulations will be possible as the line becomes more
organized. 

Further east and south, more isolated to scattered storm coverage
has yielded more discrete supercells. Large hail up to golf ball
size has already been reported, and with a very buoyant and strongly
sheared environment still in place downstream, very large hail will
remain a concern for far southeast AR, northern MS, and parts of
middle TN. Recent WoFS guidance suggests hail sizes between 2 to 2.5
inches will be possible with these cells over the next couple of
hours. These discrete storms are beginning to display organized
mesocyclones and will continue to migrate across a warm sector with
STP values between 2-3, suggesting that the tornado threat
(including the potential for a strong tornado) is likely increasing
with these cells.

Mesoscale Discussion 0907
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0242 PM CDT Tue May 20 2025

Areas affected...parts of ern Kentucky...ern
Tennessee...southwestern Virginia and southwestern West Virginia

Concerning...Tornado Watch 302...

Valid 201942Z - 202145Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 302 continues.

SUMMARY...The line of storms overspreading the region could still
intensify and organize further during the next couple of hours,
accompanied by increasing potential for strong to severe surface
gusts, and perhaps a tornado.

DISCUSSION...The narrow linear convective system has maintained
generally modest intensity as it continues to advance into/across
the Cumberland and southern Allegheny Plateau vicinity.  Due to the
strength of the upper flow/shear, there has been little in the way
of trailing anvil precipitation develop, and the elongated
convectively generated surface cold pool remains modest to weak in
strength.  However, in the presence of strong deep-layer shear,
objective analysis indicates the potential for continuing updraft
inflow of moist boundary-layer air, characterized by CAPE of
500-1000 J/kg, into the crest of the higher terrain.  This could
still promote further intensification and organization during the
next few hours.  

Where it is intersected by the line of storms, the quasi-stationary
to warm frontal zone, north of Jackson KY toward the Charleston WV
area, may still provide one possible focus for an evolving meso-beta
scale cyclonic circulation, with increasing potential for damaging
wind gusts and/or a tornado.

PUBLIC SEVERE WEATHER OUTLOOK  
NWS STORM PREDICTION CENTER NORMAN OK
0840 PM CDT MON MAY 19 2025

...Severe thunderstorms expected over parts of the southern Plains
into the Ozarks and mid Mississippi Valley this evening and
overnight...

* LOCATIONS...
  Western and Northern Arkansas
  Missouri
  Far Eastern Oklahoma
  North-Central and Northeast Texas
  Southern Illinois

* HAZARDS...
  Widespread damaging winds, some hurricane force
  Several tornadoes, a few intense
  Scattered large hail, some baseball size

* SUMMARY...
  A significant severe weather episode should continue tonight
  across parts of the South-Central States. Strong tornadoes,
  scattered to widespread damaging wind swaths, and very large
  hail remain possible.

Preparedness actions...

Tornadoes at night can be particularly dangerous because they 
are usually fast-moving and difficult to see. Stay tuned to
NOAA Weather Radio, weather.gov, or other media for watches and
warnings. A tornado watch means that conditions are favorable
for tornadoes to form during the next several hours. If a tornado
warning is issued for your area, move to a place of safety,
ideally in a basement or interior room on the lowest floor of a
sturdy building.

Mesoscale Discussion 0883
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0338 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Areas affected...parts of east central and northeastern Oklahoma

Concerning...Tornado Watch 292...

Valid 192038Z - 192245Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 292 continues.

SUMMARY...Long-lived discrete supercell development accompanied by
potential for a couple of strong tornadoes remains possible, while
spreading across the I-40 into I-44 corridors of northeastern
Oklahoma through 5-7 PM CDT.

DISCUSSION...A clustering of strong to severe storms, including a
couple of sustained tornado producing supercells continues to
develop north/northeastward, within a seasonably moist and
moderately unstable warm sector, well east of the dryline.  This has
been supported by a weak lead mid-level perturbation progressing
toward the Ozark Plateau.

The supercells are generally focused along/west of a strengthening
(40+ kt) 850 mb jet axis, and now within an area of stronger surface
pressure falls (including 2-3+ mb/2 hourly, evident in 20Z surface
observations).  As long as the supercells remain more or less
discrete, the environment remains conducive to additional tornado
development, with perhaps some increase in potential for a strong
tornado or two into early evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 0882
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0331 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Areas affected...Southern Iowa into northeast Missouri

Concerning...Severe potential...Severe Thunderstorm Watch likely 

Valid 192031Z - 192200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms moving out of northern Missouri will pose a
severe hail risk for parts of southern Iowa and northeast Missouri
over the next few hours. Watch issuance is expected.

DISCUSSION...Elevated convection continues to rapidly develop
northward across northern Missouri and is spreading into
south-central Iowa within a zone of strong warm air advection
between 925-850 mb. Despite being elevated in nature, MUCAPE and
effective shear downstream across IA and northeast MO remains very
favorable for organized convection (MUCAPE 1500-2000 J/kg and 45-55
knots respectively). Storm mode will likely remain a mix of
supercells and clusters, but intense updrafts will be capable of
producing severe hail, most likely between 1 to 2 inches diameter. A
severe thunderstorm watch will be needed soon to address this
threat.

Mesoscale Discussion 0881
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0312 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Areas affected...Southeast Nebraska to northeast Kansas

Concerning...Tornado Watch 293...294...

Valid 192012Z - 192215Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 293, 294 continues.

SUMMARY...The threat for large hail, severe wind, and tornadoes
continues across southeast Nebraska into northeast Kansas, though a
couple of localized corridors of higher tornado potential are
becoming apparent.

DISCUSSION...Convection developing along a cold front/confluence
axis across southeast NE continues to intensify, and a few cells
have begun to show signs of persistent mid-level rotation based on
KUEX velocity imagery. Additional cells continue to develop along
the boundary, so storm coverage is expected to increase over the
next 1-2 hours.  Ambient vorticity along the strongly confluent
boundary coupled with strong, organizing updrafts deepening atop the
boundary should support a tornado threat for the next few hours,
though tornado strength/longevity may be modulated by destructive
storm interactions. Regardless, a large hail threat will continue
with 1 inch hail recently reported. 

Further southeast into northeast KS, deep convection is developing
along the dryline per GOES imagery and latest lightning data.
Modifying an 18 UTC OAX sounding based on warm sector observations
suggests that sufficient buoyancy and low-level helicity is in place
to support STP values up to 2 downstream of the developing storms.
Strong cross-boundary flow should promote supercellular storm modes
with a strong tornado and very large hail threat for the next couple
of hours along the KS/NE border.

Mesoscale Discussion 0880
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0234 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Areas affected...Northeast Arkansas and adjacent portions of
Mississippi...Tennessee...and Missouri

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 191934Z - 192130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated convection developing across northeast
Arkansas/parts of the mid-Mississippi River Valley may sufficiently
intensify to pose a hail/wind threat through late afternoon.
Coverage of strong/severe storms should remain too limited for watch
issuance.

DISCUSSION...Over the past hour, shallow convection has percolated
across northeast AR as temperatures warm into the mid 80s amid low
to mid 70 dewpoints. Within the last 15 minutes, GOES IR imagery
shows a few deeper towers developing, suggesting that this
convection is beginning to overcome lingering MLCIN and fully
realizing the high-buoyancy environment (MLCAPE estimated between
2500-3000 J/kg). 30-40 knot flow between 5-6 km sampled by regional
VWPs is supporting bulk shear values around 30 knots, which should
be sufficient to support a few stronger/severe cells through late
afternoon. Large hail should be the primary concern with
deeper/stronger cells, though numerous storms in close proximity may
promote destructive storm interactions and/or some degree of
clustering with an more pronounced damaging wind threat. In general,
severe storm coverage should remain sufficiently limited due to weak
forcing for ascent to preclude watch issuance at this time (though a
more robust/widespread severe threat is expected to emerge later
tonight).

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0322 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Valid 211200Z - 271200Z

Mainly zonal mid-level flow through the middle of the week will give
way to upper ridging in the Plains as mid-level troughs deepen
across the western and eastern U.S. by the end of the week. By the
weekend into early next week, the western mid-level trough will
de-amplify while progressing toward the Plains. Surface high
pressure will build across the central and northern U.S. through the
week, while a surface low will encourage the northward return of
moisture across the southern Plains by the end of the week toward
the weekend. Overall quiescent fire weather conditions are expected
through most of the extended range. The largest concern for future
significant wildfire-spread potential remains across portions of the
Southwest, where prolonged warm and dry conditions will support the
continued curing of fuels. Disagreement remains among medium-range
guidance members in terms of the evolution of the de-amplifying
western upper trough by the weekend. Stronger surface winds may
develop over parts of the Southwest by the weekend, but confidence
in this scenario is too low for the introduction of Critical
probabilities at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 0860
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0321 PM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...much of western Oklahoma...southwest
Kansas...extreme eastern Panhandle

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 182021Z - 182215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered supercells capable of strong tornadoes and very
large hail are forecast from late afternoon into the evening from
parts of northwest Oklahoma into southwest Kansas. EF3+ tornadoes
may occur.

DISCUSSION...Surface analysis and visible imagery clearly outline
the unstable warm sector, situated between a dryline from southeast
CO into the eastern TX Panhandle, and a warm front/retreating
outflow draped across northern OK into south-central KS. The air
mass has become very unstable, and will continue to develop
northward. This air mass is coincident with an already strongly
sheared environment with effective SRH over 200 m2/s2. These
low-level shear values will increase markedly later today and during
the evening as the low level jet increases with effective SRH of
300-400 m2/s2 common.

While very cool air and clouds currently exist over northern OK into
south-central KS, a strengthening low-level jet will likely yield
clearing later in the evening, which may allow the tornado threat to
expand farther eastward.

Mesoscale Discussion 0859
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0212 PM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...northeast Colorado...western Nebraska...northwest
Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 181912Z - 182145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Supercells capable of very large hail, tornadoes, and
damaging wind are likely to develop after 21Z over northeast
Colorado, spreading into western Nebraska and northwest Kansas
through evening.

DISCUSSION...A surface low continues to deepen over eastern CO as
the shortwave trough moves across the area. Surface analysis shows a
prominent plume of low-level moisture extending out of western KS
and across northeast CO, where dewpoints are holding in the lower
50s F. 

Full heating near and south of this moisture plume will erode the
minimal capping inversion by around 21Z, and rapid thunderstorm
development is expected. The combination of strong instability,
steep lapse rates, and veering winds with height will strongly favor
supercells capable of very large hail, and a few tornadoes. Activity
should easily remain severe into NE and KS this evening as the
southeasterly low-level jet persists, maintaining moisture advection
as well as shear and inflow.

Mesoscale Discussion 0858
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 PM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...Northwest to west-central Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 181858Z - 182130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development along the dryline is expected
roughly between 20-22 UTC across northwest to west-central Texas.
The convective environment will support supercells capable of large
hail, severe gusts, and a few tornadoes. Watch issuance is likely as
storms begin to develop.

DISCUSSION...Recent GOES visible imagery shows shallow, but slowly
deepening, cumulus along and just ahead of a sharpening dryline as
it continues to mix east and boundary-layer depth increases amid
filtered diurnal heating. Latest RAP/HRRR forecast soundings suggest
any lingering MLCIN will be minimized as surface temperatures warm
into the 92-95 F range over the next few hours within the warm
sector. Regional VWPs show flow within the lowest 2-3 km AGL
oriented roughly along the dryline, which should promote adequate
residence times for parcels to reach their LFCs and initiate deep
convection. Latest high-res solutions suggest this should occur
generally between 20-22 UTC. Thunderstorms will mature within a very
unstable air mass with MLCAPE values exceeding 4000 J/kg and
effective shear on the order of 40-50 knots. Limited directional
shear will initially promote splitting supercells with an attendant
very large hail threat (most probable max hail size may be 2-3
inches in diameter). Southeasterly low-level winds across northwest
TX may support adequate low-level veering for some tornado threat.
Further south (roughly south of I-20), 1.5 to 2.5 km LCL heights and
more backed low-level flow will modulate the initial tornado
potential. After 00 UTC a strengthening low-level jet will increase
low-level hodograph curvature and support an increasing tornado
threat with any remaining discrete right-moving supercells across
much of central/northern TX. Watch issuance will likely be needed as
thunderstorm initiation becomes more imminent.

Mesoscale Discussion 0854
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0656 AM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...central Arkansas and northern Mississippi

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 284...

Valid 181156Z - 181400Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 284
continues.

SUMMARY...Long-lived cluster of thunderstorms, with a history of
producing wind damage, continues to move through central Arkansas.
The overall environment should continue to support a severe threat
ahead of this MCS through at least mid morning.

DISCUSSION...Long-lived linear MCS, with a history of producing wind
damage, continues to move east-southeast through much of Arkansas
this morning. This MCS is moving along a west-northwest to
east-southeast CAPE gradient stretching from northeast Oklahoma into
southern Georgia and is following a similar path as to an earlier
MCS from last evening into earlier this morning. 

The overall large-scale environment will continue to support
maintenance of this MCS as the MCS has access to MUCAPE greater than
2000 J/kg and effective shear around 50 knots. The organization of
the MCS, the overall favorable environment,and knowledge that the
earlier MCS traversed a similar environment and is continuing
through Alabama supports the severe threat through the morning. A
downstream watch may become necessary for portions of far eastern
Arkansas and northern Mississippi as the MCS approaches the edge of
Severe Thunderstorm Watch #284.

Mesoscale Discussion 0853
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0640 AM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...Central Alabama and far west-central Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 181140Z - 181245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A thunderstorm cluster moving across central Alabama will
pose a threat for isolated large hail and wind damage in the near
term. Longer term evolution of this cluster is less certain, but the
area will continue to be monitored for potential watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...Long-lived cluster of thunderstorms continues to move
across central Alabama this morning along the instability gradient.
The strongest of these thunderstorms (located across eastern
Tuscaloosa County) appears to have increased in intensity over the
last hour and has even developed a rear-inflow jet (RIJ) --
suggested by radar reflectivity structure and an increase in
rear-to-front wind speeds. This will pose a damaging wind threat in
the short term.

Additionally, overall reflectivity structure of the thunderstorm
complex suggests the development of a mesoscale convective vortex.
Should this be the case, an increase in updraft intensity would be
expected in the near term owing to increasing convergence and
stronger deep-layer shear. MUCAPE is around 1000 J/kg and deep-layer
shear around 50 knots across the thunderstorm cluster now, but drops
off to around 1000 J/kg and 30-40 knots as the cluster approaches
western Georgia.

As the thunderstorms move east, the lack of clarity of the MCV
evolution and a slightly less favorable environment results in
uncertainty as to whether a severe thunderstorm watch will be needed
downstream. Conditions will continue to be monitored for potential
watch issuance.
