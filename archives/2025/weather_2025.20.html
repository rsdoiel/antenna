Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0737 AM CDT Thu May 22 2025

Valid 221300Z - 231200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR NORTHERN
PORTIONS OF TEXAS AND SOUTHERN OKLAHOMA...

...SUMMARY...
Severe storms are possible across parts of the southern Plains this
afternoon and evening. Large hail is the main threat, along with
severe gusts.  A few instances of 2+ inch diameter hail are
possible.

...Southern Plains...
Weak short-wave ridging will shift into the central High Plains
later today and mid-level heights are forecast to rise from the
southern Rockies into the northern Plains.  As this occurs, a
synoptic front draped across OK will sag south and sharpen over the
TX South Plains/southern OK by mid-late afternoon.  Strong heating
south of the boundary will contribute to a moderately to very
unstable airmass.  Scattered thunderstorms will likely evolve and
mature within this steep lapse-rate environment with 0-6km bulk
shear around 40kt.  Wind profiles favor supercells and hodographs
suggest very large hail is likely with the most robust updrafts.
Severe gusts are possible with the stronger downdrafts and upscale
growth into a couple of thunderstorm clusters is forecast during the
evening as this activity moves into northwest/north-central TX
during the evening hours.

...Southern/Eastern Florida...
Seasonally cool 500-mb temperatures (-8 to -10 deg C) and moderately
steep mid-level lapse rates are forecast equatorward of a
large-scale eastern U.S. upper trough.  Deep westerly flow favors an
east coast sea breeze, and this should be where convection focuses
as temperatures warm through the upper 80s and lower 90s.  Localized
severe gusts and large hail are the primary threats with this
diurnally driven convection.

...Central High Plains...
The aforementioned mid-level ridge and an eastward-migrating
mid-level trough over the northern Rockies will favor southeasterly
low-level upslope flow into the central High Plains.  Modest
moisture coupled with strong heating will yield 250-750 J/kg SBCAPE
by mid afternoon east of the Front Range.  Recent model runs of the
HRRR show a dearth of storm coverage, but the 00z HREF implies at
least isolated storms.  Elongated straight-line hodographs will
support east-southeastward moving storms within an environment
featuring steep 700-500 mb lapse rates (8 deg C/km).  A couple of
stronger storms may result in an isolated risk for large hail/severe
gusts.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0403 AM CDT Thu May 22 2025

Valid 251200Z - 301200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Severe storms are possible across parts of the central/southern High
Plains on D4/Sunday as ridging shifts east and broad southwesterly
flow overspreads the southern High Plains. Moderate to strong
instability is forecast with modest height falls and forecast
soundings show an uncapped airmass.  Scattered to widespread
thunderstorms are likely across much of the warm sector across
central Oklahoma and northwest Texas. Details of storm mode and
hazard type remain nebulous at this time. However, a focused zone of
the most likely threat area exists across northwest Texas and
southwest Oklahoma where 15% probabilities have been introduced. 

Beyond Day 4, some isolated strong to severe storms will be possible
along a stalled front from the Southeast to Far West Texas.
Mid-level shortwave troughs embedded within mostly zonal flow along
this frontal zone may focus some severe weather, but significant
uncertainty exists regarding the timing and amplitude of any of
these shortwave troughs. A few damaging wind gusts will be possible
from this activity, but a more widespread threat is not anticipated.

Mesoscale Discussion 0923
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0155 PM CDT Wed May 21 2025

Areas affected...parts of south central Nebraska into north central
Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 211855Z - 212130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A consolidating area of southeastward developing
thunderstorm activity may be accompanied by increasing strong to
severe wind gusts by 4-6 PM CDT.  It is not clear that a severe
weather watch is needed, but trends will be monitored.

DISCUSSION...Beneath seasonably cold (temperatures around/below -20
C at 500 mb) and strong (40-50 kt at 500 mb) west-northwesterly
mid-level flow, low-level lapse rates are becoming quite steep, with
sufficient boundary-layer moisture to support weak CAPE and
scattered developing thunderstorm activity across parts of south
central Nebraska and northeastern Colorado into northwestern Kansas.
 It appears that convection will continue to gradually increase and
modestly intensify with further destabilization through late
afternoon.  

Aided by large-scale forcing for ascent associated with a
southeastward developing area of lower/mid-tropospheric warm
advection, various model output suggests that convection may
gradually grow upscale into a cluster across the central
Nebraska/Kansas border vicinity through 21-23Z.  Coinciding with
peak daytime heating, and deep boundary-layer mixing (including
surface temperature/dew point spreads around 35-40F), strong
downdrafts, enhanced by evaporative cooling and downward mixing of
momentum, may contribute to a few locally severe surface gusts. 
Gradually, consolidating outflow may yield an expanding area of
strong to, perhaps, severe gusts, before convection wanes this
evening.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Wed May 21 2025

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...Mogollon Rim and west-central New Mexico...
A upper-level short wave trough moving through the Great Basin will
promote increasing mid-level flow over the Southwest. The enhanced
mid-level flow atop a very dry, well-mixed boundary layer and steep
low level lapse rates will promote breezy surface winds during the
afternoon across the Mogollon Rim and west-central New Mexico. The
winds and dry conditions combined with receptive fuels as evidenced
through current active fires supports introduction of Elevated
highlights for the area.

..Williams.. 05/21/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0145 AM CDT Wed May 21 2025/

...Synopsis...
A compact midlevel shortwave trough will move eastward across the
Northwest on Thursday, while a related 50-kt jet maximum overspreads
northern CA. This will promote locally dry/breezy conditions across
parts of the CA Central Valley during the afternoon, and given areas
of receptive fuels, locally elevated fire-weather conditions are
possible. However, the overlap of dry/breezy conditions and
receptive fuels appears too limited for highlights at this time.

0247 PM CDT Wed May 21 2025

Valid 212000Z - 221200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
THE OZARKS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe storms remain possible in the Upper Ohio
Valley, parts of eastern North Carolina, North Florida, parts of the
central Plains, and Deep South Texas. Additional, scattered strong
to severe storms are possible in the Ozarks this evening.

...20Z Update...
Severe probabilities have been adjusted based on current
observational/convective trends. A narrow zone in western
Pennsylvania will remain favorable in the short term for a brief
tornado prior to precipitation stabilizing the low levels and
low-level winds veering. Scattered elevated convection is still
expected across parts of the Ozarks later this evening. See the
previous forecast for additional details.

..Wendt.. 05/21/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1131 AM CDT Wed May 21 2025/

...Eastern North Carolina/southern Virginia...
In the wake of early morning convection, air mass
recovery/destabilization will occur today in vicinity of the
eastward-transitioning surface wave and in vicinity of the roughly
west/east-oriented surface boundary located near/south of the
Virginia/North Carolina border. Drying westerly low-level
trajectories will exist to the south of the front and behind the
surface wave, with severe-storm favorable ingredients/potential
development tending to focus across far northeast North Carolina
where moderate buoyancy will be maximized with strong westerlies
aloft (40+ kt effective shear). While severe storm
coverage/likelihood may not be as high as previously thought, some
potential for large hail, damaging wind gusts and possibly a tornado
will still exist on an isolated basis.

...Ozarks/Mid-South...
While rich boundary-layer moisture will remain confined across south
Texas and Louisiana, a strengthening low-level baroclinic zone will
focus near the Kansas/Oklahoma border east-southeast into the
Mid-South. Guidance is rather consistent in developing at least
elevated convection to the cool side of this zone by evening. This
will be coincident with an intensifying mid-level speed max.
Forecast soundings depict potentially very strong mid to upper-level
speed shear within the slightly north of west flow regime. Coupled
with steep mid-level lapse rates, this setup could yield a few
elevated supercells capable of large hail and perhaps locally
damaging winds. 

...Central Plains...
A mid-level vorticity lobe initially over Wyoming this morning will
dig east-southeastward into the lower Missouri Valley by early
evening amidst west-northwesterly flow aloft. Heating will result in
very steep 0-3 km lapse rates by mid afternoon with several hundred
J/kg SBCAPE. Elongated hodographs will support quick-moving cells
capable of an isolated risk for severe wind gusts during the late
afternoon through around sunset (roughly 20-01z).

...Upper Ohio Valley including PA/OH/WV border region...
A corridor of modest boundary-layer heating is expected ahead of the
primary surface cyclone drifting across northern Ohio toward Lake
Erie. Coupled with cooling mid-level temperatures, weak
surface-based buoyancy is expected by midday into the afternoon.
Deep-layer shear will not be strong given proximity to the mid-level
trough, but should be adequate for weak/transient mid-level
rotation. With numerous thunderstorms expected, small to marginally
severe hail and isolated damaging winds are anticipated. A brief
tornado or two is also possible with storms near the warm front,
before convection weakens as it moves east-northeastward into
less-buoyant surface conditions.

...North Florida and southern Georgia...
Along the southeastward-moving cold front, moderate buoyancy is
expected ahead of the front.  A veered low-level wind profile will
limit effective bulk shear, but scattered thunderstorms could yield
multicells and perhaps a transient supercell. Isolated damaging
winds and marginally severe hail are possible with the stronger
storms. For additional short-term details, see Mesoscale Discussion
920.

...Far southern Louisiana/far southern Mississippi...
Sufficient residual elevated buoyancy in the immediate post-frontal
environment may allow for some storms to produce hail to near severe
levels, mostly over just the next few hours this afternoon and on a
very isolated basis.

...Deep South Texas...
A very moist and unstable air mass (2000-4000 J/kg MLCAPE later
today) exists across the region, aside from some higher cloud cover
spreading into the region via a slowly approaching and weakening
convective complex south of the international border. Additional
convection will likely develop in adjacent Mexico over the higher
terrain this afternoon, and some of these storms may spread east
across the lower Rio Grande Valley this evening. Isolated large hail
and severe-caliber wind gusts may accompany these storms.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0225 PM CDT Wed May 21 2025

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PLAINS...WESTERN TEXAS...AND THE EASTERN
FLORIDA PENINSULA...

...SUMMARY...
A few strong to severe storms are possible across portions of the
central Plains, western Texas, and across southeast Florida on
Friday.

...Synopsis...
Upper ridging will persist over the central CONUS as a mid-level
trough meanders along the East Coast and a second upper trough
traverses the Interior West on Friday. Surface high pressure will
dominate much of the central, northern, and eastern CONUS while a
surface low develops over the central High Plains. Ahead of the
surface low, adequate moisture return within a low-level warm-air
advection regime will encourage thunderstorm development across
portions of the central and southern Plains, with a few strong
storms possible. Strong to potentially severe storms may also form
over western TX as boundary layer mixing encourages the eastward
advancement of the dryline, where low-level convergence will be
maximized. A few strong storms may develop across eastern portions
of the FL Peninsula ahead of a stalled frontal boundary.

...Portions of the central and southern Plains...
Multiple rounds of deep-moist convection are likely along a diffuse
baroclinic boundary across the central Plains, driven primarily by a
warm-air advection regime. Strong to severe storms are most likely
during the afternoon and evening hours. By late afternoon,
supercells may develop off of the higher terrain of northeastern
Colorado as upslope flow and diurnal heating maximize lift amid 8-9
C/km mid-level lapse rates and elongated hodographs. These storms
may progress east-southeastward through the overnight hours,
accompanied by some threat for large hail.

...Portions of western Texas...
As the dryline mixes eastward by afternoon peak heating, isolated
but strong thunderstorms may develop atop a dry boundary layer,
which may deepen to 700 mb. Given some hodograph elongation and over
30 kts of effective bulk shear, some of these storms may develop
into organized multicells. 9 C/km lapse rates characterizing the
boundary layer will support severe gust potential with the stronger
storms.

...Portions of the eastern Florida Peninsula... 
Thunderstorms should develop ahead of a stalled front during the
afternoon, where rich low-level moisture beneath modest mid-level
lapse rates will contribute to over 2000 J/kg MLCAPE. With modestly
elongated hodographs in place, multicells may form, accompanied by a
sparse hail/wind threat.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1227 PM CDT Wed May 21 2025

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Severe storms are possible across parts of the southern Plains
tomorrow/Thursday, with large hail the main threat. A few instances
of 2+ inch diameter hail are possible.

...Synopsis...
Broad northwesterly flow will prevail across much of the eastern
U.S. as a mid-level trough ejects into the Atlantic, an upper ridge
builds over the central CONUS, and a pronounced mid-level impulse
traverses the northern Rockies tomorrow (Thursday). A surface low
will track along the Mid-Atlantic Coastline while surface high
pressure overspreads much of the Midwest into the Southeast, and lee
troughing prevails across the southern Plains. Thunderstorms are
likely along the East Coast and the FL Peninsula, in association
with the departing upper trough. Storms developing ahead of a
southward-sagging cold front in FL have the best potential for
becoming strong to locally severe over the East Coast. At least
scattered thunderstorms are also likely across the Southern Plains,
northwestward into the northern Rockies, given lee troughing and
low-level upslope flow. Thunderstorms developing along a baroclinic
zone along the Red River will benefit from strong instability and
adequate wind shear, and will have the potential to become severe.

...Southern Plains...
Elevated thunderstorms are expected to develop in central OK within
a warm-air advection regime, to the north of a west-to-east oriented
baroclinic boundary, which is expected to be situated along the Red
River during the morning/early afternoon hours. Through the day,
storms are expected to propagate southward toward a surface-based
airmass over northern TX, where upper 60s/low 70s F surface
dewpoints beneath 8 C/km mid-level lapse rates will contribute to
2500-4000 J/kg MLCAPE. Low-level southerly flow, quickly veering to
northwesterly and strengthening with height, will result in
elongated hodographs with some low-level curvature near the
baroclinic boundary. As such, the overall CAPE/shear parameter space
will support supercells with large to very large hail potential. If
a supercell can anchor along the baroclinic boundary, a tornado will
also be possible.

...East Florida Peninsula...
A southward-sagging cold front will begin to stall across the FL
Peninsula during the afternoon hours, preceded by rich low-level
moisture beneath 6.5-7.5 C/km mid-level lapse rates, which will
boost MLCAPE over 2500 J/kg. Modest northwesterly mid-level flow
impinging on the peninsula will encourage deep-layer speed shear
over 40 kts, that in tandem with moderate to strong instability,
will support multicells and transient supercells by afternoon. Large
hail and strong, damaging wind gusts are the primary threats with
the most intense storms. 

...Northern Rockies...
Scattered thunderstorm development is expected across central and
northern ID into southwestern MT as strong forcing for ascent with
the passing mid-level trough overspreads a deep, mixed boundary
layer during the afternoon. Forecast soundings show inverted-v
profiles extending up to 500 mb. As such, some downward momentum
transport via evaporative cooling should encourage stronger wind
gusts with the deeper storm cores. However, confidence is not high
enough for severe gusts to introduce Category 1/Marginal risk
probabilities at this time.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Locally elevated fire weather conditions are expected along the

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0144 AM CDT Wed May 21 2025/

...Synopsis...
Embedded within a belt of zonal midlevel flow, a 60-kt jet streak
will overspread the central Rockies during the day today. In
response, enhanced downslope flow will promote dry/breezy conditions
along the CO Front Range during the afternoon. While locally
elevated fire-weather conditions are possible, fuels are not
particularly receptive to fire spread at this time.

Valid 211630Z - 221200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS EASTERN
NORTH CAROLINA...SOUTHERN GEORGIA/NORTHERN FLORIDA...AND THE
OZARKS...

...SUMMARY...
The most likely areas for severe storms are across parts of far
eastern North Carolina, the upper Ohio River Valley and parts of the
Southeast this afternoon, in addition to the Ozarks this evening.

...Eastern North Carolina/southern Virginia...
In the wake of early morning convection, air mass
recovery/destabilization will occur today in vicinity of the
eastward-transitioning surface wave and in vicinity of the roughly
west/east-oriented surface boundary located near/south of the
Virginia/North Carolina border. Drying westerly low-level
trajectories will exist to the south of the front and behind the
surface wave, with severe-storm favorable ingredients/potential
development tending to focus across far northeast North Carolina
where moderate buoyancy will be maximized with strong westerlies
aloft (40+ kt effective shear). While severe storm
coverage/likelihood may not be as high as previously thought, some
potential for large hail, damaging wind gusts and possibly a tornado
will still exist on an isolated basis.

...Ozarks/Mid-South...
While rich boundary-layer moisture will remain confined across south
Texas and Louisiana, a strengthening low-level baroclinic zone will
focus near the Kansas/Oklahoma border east-southeast into the
Mid-South. Guidance is rather consistent in developing at least
elevated convection to the cool side of this zone by evening. This
will be coincident with an intensifying mid-level speed max.
Forecast soundings depict potentially very strong mid to upper-level
speed shear within the slightly north of west flow regime. Coupled
with steep mid-level lapse rates, this setup could yield a few
elevated supercells capable of large hail and perhaps locally
damaging winds. 

...Central Plains...
A mid-level vorticity lobe initially over Wyoming this morning will
dig east-southeastward into the lower Missouri Valley by early
evening amidst west-northwesterly flow aloft. Heating will result in
very steep 0-3 km lapse rates by mid afternoon with several hundred
J/kg SBCAPE. Elongated hodographs will support quick-moving cells
capable of an isolated risk for severe wind gusts during the late
afternoon through around sunset (roughly 20-01z).

...Upper Ohio Valley including PA/OH/WV border region...
A corridor of modest boundary-layer heating is expected ahead of the
primary surface cyclone drifting across northern Ohio toward Lake
Erie. Coupled with cooling mid-level temperatures, weak
surface-based buoyancy is expected by midday into the afternoon.
Deep-layer shear will not be strong given proximity to the mid-level
trough, but should be adequate for weak/transient mid-level
rotation. With numerous thunderstorms expected, small to marginally
severe hail and isolated damaging winds are anticipated. A brief
tornado or two is also possible with storms near the warm front,
before convection weakens as it moves east-northeastward into
less-buoyant surface conditions.

...North Florida and southern Georgia...
Along the southeastward-moving cold front, moderate buoyancy is
expected ahead of the front.  A veered low-level wind profile will
limit effective bulk shear, but scattered thunderstorms could yield
multicells and perhaps a transient supercell. Isolated damaging
winds and marginally severe hail are possible with the stronger
storms. For additional short-term details, see Mesoscale Discussion
920.

...Far southern Louisiana/far southern Mississippi...
Sufficient residual elevated buoyancy in the immediate post-frontal
environment may allow for some storms to produce hail to near severe
levels, mostly over just the next few hours this afternoon and on a
very isolated basis.

...Deep South Texas...
A very moist and unstable air mass (2000-4000 J/kg MLCAPE later
today) exists across the region, aside from some higher cloud cover
spreading into the region via a slowly approaching and weakening
convective complex south of the international border. Additional
convection will likely develop in adjacent Mexico over the higher
terrain this afternoon, and some of these storms may spread east
across the lower Rio Grande Valley this evening. Isolated large hail
and severe-caliber wind gusts may accompany these storms.

Mesoscale Discussion 0908
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0333 PM CDT Tue May 20 2025

Areas affected...Eastern Arkansas to the Tennessee River Valley

Concerning...Tornado Watch 303...305...

Valid 202033Z - 202230Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 303, 305 continues.

SUMMARY...The threat for large hail and tornadoes continues across
watches 303 and 305, though the potential for widespread damaging
winds is expected to increase over the next 2-3 hours across for
parts of northwest TN and far southwest KY. The greatest
hail/tornado threat will likely be focused across southeast AR into
northeast MS and parts of middle TN.

DISCUSSION...Numerous supercells continue to mature across eastern
AR with more isolated to scattered coverage across northern MS into
western/middle TN. Convective coverage/close storm proximity has
resulted in destructive interactions of the past hour across
northeast AR, and recent velocity imagery from KNQA shows signs of
consolidating outflow across northeast AR. This suggests that the
early stages of upscale growth is occurring and may promote an
increasing damaging/severe wind threat downstream into parts of
western TN and west/southwest KY. Strong low-level shear sampled by
the KQNA VWP hints that even with this storm mode transition,
embedded circulations will be possible as the line becomes more
organized. 

Further east and south, more isolated to scattered storm coverage
has yielded more discrete supercells. Large hail up to golf ball
size has already been reported, and with a very buoyant and strongly
sheared environment still in place downstream, very large hail will
remain a concern for far southeast AR, northern MS, and parts of
middle TN. Recent WoFS guidance suggests hail sizes between 2 to 2.5
inches will be possible with these cells over the next couple of
hours. These discrete storms are beginning to display organized
mesocyclones and will continue to migrate across a warm sector with
STP values between 2-3, suggesting that the tornado threat
(including the potential for a strong tornado) is likely increasing
with these cells.

Areas affected...parts of ern Kentucky...ern
Tennessee...southwestern Virginia and southwestern West Virginia

Concerning...Tornado Watch 302...

Valid 201942Z - 202145Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 302 continues.

SUMMARY...The line of storms overspreading the region could still
intensify and organize further during the next couple of hours,
accompanied by increasing potential for strong to severe surface
gusts, and perhaps a tornado.

DISCUSSION...The narrow linear convective system has maintained
generally modest intensity as it continues to advance into/across
the Cumberland and southern Allegheny Plateau vicinity.  Due to the
strength of the upper flow/shear, there has been little in the way
of trailing anvil precipitation develop, and the elongated
convectively generated surface cold pool remains modest to weak in
strength.  However, in the presence of strong deep-layer shear,
objective analysis indicates the potential for continuing updraft
inflow of moist boundary-layer air, characterized by CAPE of
500-1000 J/kg, into the crest of the higher terrain.  This could
still promote further intensification and organization during the
next few hours.  

Where it is intersected by the line of storms, the quasi-stationary
to warm frontal zone, north of Jackson KY toward the Charleston WV
area, may still provide one possible focus for an evolving meso-beta
scale cyclonic circulation, with increasing potential for damaging
wind gusts and/or a tornado.

PUBLIC SEVERE WEATHER OUTLOOK  
NWS STORM PREDICTION CENTER NORMAN OK
0840 PM CDT MON MAY 19 2025

...Severe thunderstorms expected over parts of the southern Plains
into the Ozarks and mid Mississippi Valley this evening and
overnight...

* LOCATIONS...
  Western and Northern Arkansas
  Missouri
  Far Eastern Oklahoma
  North-Central and Northeast Texas
  Southern Illinois

* HAZARDS...
  Widespread damaging winds, some hurricane force
  Several tornadoes, a few intense
  Scattered large hail, some baseball size

* SUMMARY...
  A significant severe weather episode should continue tonight
  across parts of the South-Central States. Strong tornadoes,
  scattered to widespread damaging wind swaths, and very large
  hail remain possible.

Preparedness actions...

Tornadoes at night can be particularly dangerous because they 
are usually fast-moving and difficult to see. Stay tuned to
NOAA Weather Radio, weather.gov, or other media for watches and
warnings. A tornado watch means that conditions are favorable
for tornadoes to form during the next several hours. If a tornado
warning is issued for your area, move to a place of safety,
ideally in a basement or interior room on the lowest floor of a
sturdy building.

Mesoscale Discussion 0883
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0338 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Areas affected...parts of east central and northeastern Oklahoma

Concerning...Tornado Watch 292...

Valid 192038Z - 192245Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 292 continues.

SUMMARY...Long-lived discrete supercell development accompanied by
potential for a couple of strong tornadoes remains possible, while
spreading across the I-40 into I-44 corridors of northeastern
Oklahoma through 5-7 PM CDT.

DISCUSSION...A clustering of strong to severe storms, including a
couple of sustained tornado producing supercells continues to
develop north/northeastward, within a seasonably moist and
moderately unstable warm sector, well east of the dryline.  This has
been supported by a weak lead mid-level perturbation progressing
toward the Ozark Plateau.

The supercells are generally focused along/west of a strengthening
(40+ kt) 850 mb jet axis, and now within an area of stronger surface
pressure falls (including 2-3+ mb/2 hourly, evident in 20Z surface
observations).  As long as the supercells remain more or less
discrete, the environment remains conducive to additional tornado
development, with perhaps some increase in potential for a strong
tornado or two into early evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 0882
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0331 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Areas affected...Southern Iowa into northeast Missouri

Concerning...Severe potential...Severe Thunderstorm Watch likely 

Valid 192031Z - 192200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms moving out of northern Missouri will pose a
severe hail risk for parts of southern Iowa and northeast Missouri
over the next few hours. Watch issuance is expected.

DISCUSSION...Elevated convection continues to rapidly develop
northward across northern Missouri and is spreading into
south-central Iowa within a zone of strong warm air advection
between 925-850 mb. Despite being elevated in nature, MUCAPE and
effective shear downstream across IA and northeast MO remains very
favorable for organized convection (MUCAPE 1500-2000 J/kg and 45-55
knots respectively). Storm mode will likely remain a mix of
supercells and clusters, but intense updrafts will be capable of
producing severe hail, most likely between 1 to 2 inches diameter. A
severe thunderstorm watch will be needed soon to address this
threat.

Mesoscale Discussion 0881
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0312 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Areas affected...Southeast Nebraska to northeast Kansas

Concerning...Tornado Watch 293...294...

Valid 192012Z - 192215Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 293, 294 continues.

SUMMARY...The threat for large hail, severe wind, and tornadoes
continues across southeast Nebraska into northeast Kansas, though a
couple of localized corridors of higher tornado potential are
becoming apparent.

DISCUSSION...Convection developing along a cold front/confluence
axis across southeast NE continues to intensify, and a few cells
have begun to show signs of persistent mid-level rotation based on
KUEX velocity imagery. Additional cells continue to develop along
the boundary, so storm coverage is expected to increase over the
next 1-2 hours.  Ambient vorticity along the strongly confluent
boundary coupled with strong, organizing updrafts deepening atop the
boundary should support a tornado threat for the next few hours,
though tornado strength/longevity may be modulated by destructive
storm interactions. Regardless, a large hail threat will continue
with 1 inch hail recently reported. 

Further southeast into northeast KS, deep convection is developing
along the dryline per GOES imagery and latest lightning data.
Modifying an 18 UTC OAX sounding based on warm sector observations
suggests that sufficient buoyancy and low-level helicity is in place
to support STP values up to 2 downstream of the developing storms.
Strong cross-boundary flow should promote supercellular storm modes
with a strong tornado and very large hail threat for the next couple
of hours along the KS/NE border.

Mesoscale Discussion 0880
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0234 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Areas affected...Northeast Arkansas and adjacent portions of
Mississippi...Tennessee...and Missouri

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 191934Z - 192130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated convection developing across northeast
Arkansas/parts of the mid-Mississippi River Valley may sufficiently
intensify to pose a hail/wind threat through late afternoon.
Coverage of strong/severe storms should remain too limited for watch
issuance.

DISCUSSION...Over the past hour, shallow convection has percolated
across northeast AR as temperatures warm into the mid 80s amid low
to mid 70 dewpoints. Within the last 15 minutes, GOES IR imagery
shows a few deeper towers developing, suggesting that this
convection is beginning to overcome lingering MLCIN and fully
realizing the high-buoyancy environment (MLCAPE estimated between
2500-3000 J/kg). 30-40 knot flow between 5-6 km sampled by regional
VWPs is supporting bulk shear values around 30 knots, which should
be sufficient to support a few stronger/severe cells through late
afternoon. Large hail should be the primary concern with
deeper/stronger cells, though numerous storms in close proximity may
promote destructive storm interactions and/or some degree of
clustering with an more pronounced damaging wind threat. In general,
severe storm coverage should remain sufficiently limited due to weak
forcing for ascent to preclude watch issuance at this time (though a
more robust/widespread severe threat is expected to emerge later
tonight).

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0322 PM CDT Mon May 19 2025

Valid 211200Z - 271200Z

Mainly zonal mid-level flow through the middle of the week will give
way to upper ridging in the Plains as mid-level troughs deepen
across the western and eastern U.S. by the end of the week. By the
weekend into early next week, the western mid-level trough will
de-amplify while progressing toward the Plains. Surface high
pressure will build across the central and northern U.S. through the
week, while a surface low will encourage the northward return of
moisture across the southern Plains by the end of the week toward
the weekend. Overall quiescent fire weather conditions are expected
through most of the extended range. The largest concern for future
significant wildfire-spread potential remains across portions of the
Southwest, where prolonged warm and dry conditions will support the
continued curing of fuels. Disagreement remains among medium-range
guidance members in terms of the evolution of the de-amplifying
western upper trough by the weekend. Stronger surface winds may
develop over parts of the Southwest by the weekend, but confidence
in this scenario is too low for the introduction of Critical
probabilities at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 0860
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0321 PM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...much of western Oklahoma...southwest
Kansas...extreme eastern Panhandle

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 182021Z - 182215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered supercells capable of strong tornadoes and very
large hail are forecast from late afternoon into the evening from
parts of northwest Oklahoma into southwest Kansas. EF3+ tornadoes
may occur.

DISCUSSION...Surface analysis and visible imagery clearly outline
the unstable warm sector, situated between a dryline from southeast
CO into the eastern TX Panhandle, and a warm front/retreating
outflow draped across northern OK into south-central KS. The air
mass has become very unstable, and will continue to develop
northward. This air mass is coincident with an already strongly
sheared environment with effective SRH over 200 m2/s2. These
low-level shear values will increase markedly later today and during
the evening as the low level jet increases with effective SRH of
300-400 m2/s2 common.

While very cool air and clouds currently exist over northern OK into
south-central KS, a strengthening low-level jet will likely yield
clearing later in the evening, which may allow the tornado threat to
expand farther eastward.

Mesoscale Discussion 0859
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0212 PM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...northeast Colorado...western Nebraska...northwest
Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 181912Z - 182145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Supercells capable of very large hail, tornadoes, and
damaging wind are likely to develop after 21Z over northeast
Colorado, spreading into western Nebraska and northwest Kansas
through evening.

DISCUSSION...A surface low continues to deepen over eastern CO as
the shortwave trough moves across the area. Surface analysis shows a
prominent plume of low-level moisture extending out of western KS
and across northeast CO, where dewpoints are holding in the lower
50s F. 

Full heating near and south of this moisture plume will erode the
minimal capping inversion by around 21Z, and rapid thunderstorm
development is expected. The combination of strong instability,
steep lapse rates, and veering winds with height will strongly favor
supercells capable of very large hail, and a few tornadoes. Activity
should easily remain severe into NE and KS this evening as the
southeasterly low-level jet persists, maintaining moisture advection
as well as shear and inflow.

Mesoscale Discussion 0858
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 PM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...Northwest to west-central Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 181858Z - 182130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm development along the dryline is expected
roughly between 20-22 UTC across northwest to west-central Texas.
The convective environment will support supercells capable of large
hail, severe gusts, and a few tornadoes. Watch issuance is likely as
storms begin to develop.

DISCUSSION...Recent GOES visible imagery shows shallow, but slowly
deepening, cumulus along and just ahead of a sharpening dryline as
it continues to mix east and boundary-layer depth increases amid
filtered diurnal heating. Latest RAP/HRRR forecast soundings suggest
any lingering MLCIN will be minimized as surface temperatures warm
into the 92-95 F range over the next few hours within the warm
sector. Regional VWPs show flow within the lowest 2-3 km AGL
oriented roughly along the dryline, which should promote adequate
residence times for parcels to reach their LFCs and initiate deep
convection. Latest high-res solutions suggest this should occur
generally between 20-22 UTC. Thunderstorms will mature within a very
unstable air mass with MLCAPE values exceeding 4000 J/kg and
effective shear on the order of 40-50 knots. Limited directional
shear will initially promote splitting supercells with an attendant
very large hail threat (most probable max hail size may be 2-3
inches in diameter). Southeasterly low-level winds across northwest
TX may support adequate low-level veering for some tornado threat.
Further south (roughly south of I-20), 1.5 to 2.5 km LCL heights and
more backed low-level flow will modulate the initial tornado
potential. After 00 UTC a strengthening low-level jet will increase
low-level hodograph curvature and support an increasing tornado
threat with any remaining discrete right-moving supercells across
much of central/northern TX. Watch issuance will likely be needed as
thunderstorm initiation becomes more imminent.

Mesoscale Discussion 0854
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0656 AM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...central Arkansas and northern Mississippi

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 284...

Valid 181156Z - 181400Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 284
continues.

SUMMARY...Long-lived cluster of thunderstorms, with a history of
producing wind damage, continues to move through central Arkansas.
The overall environment should continue to support a severe threat
ahead of this MCS through at least mid morning.

DISCUSSION...Long-lived linear MCS, with a history of producing wind
damage, continues to move east-southeast through much of Arkansas
this morning. This MCS is moving along a west-northwest to
east-southeast CAPE gradient stretching from northeast Oklahoma into
southern Georgia and is following a similar path as to an earlier
MCS from last evening into earlier this morning. 

The overall large-scale environment will continue to support
maintenance of this MCS as the MCS has access to MUCAPE greater than
2000 J/kg and effective shear around 50 knots. The organization of
the MCS, the overall favorable environment,and knowledge that the
earlier MCS traversed a similar environment and is continuing
through Alabama supports the severe threat through the morning. A
downstream watch may become necessary for portions of far eastern
Arkansas and northern Mississippi as the MCS approaches the edge of
Severe Thunderstorm Watch #284.

Mesoscale Discussion 0853
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0640 AM CDT Sun May 18 2025

Areas affected...Central Alabama and far west-central Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 181140Z - 181245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A thunderstorm cluster moving across central Alabama will
pose a threat for isolated large hail and wind damage in the near
term. Longer term evolution of this cluster is less certain, but the
area will continue to be monitored for potential watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...Long-lived cluster of thunderstorms continues to move
across central Alabama this morning along the instability gradient.
The strongest of these thunderstorms (located across eastern
Tuscaloosa County) appears to have increased in intensity over the
last hour and has even developed a rear-inflow jet (RIJ) --
suggested by radar reflectivity structure and an increase in
rear-to-front wind speeds. This will pose a damaging wind threat in
the short term.

Additionally, overall reflectivity structure of the thunderstorm
complex suggests the development of a mesoscale convective vortex.
Should this be the case, an increase in updraft intensity would be
expected in the near term owing to increasing convergence and
stronger deep-layer shear. MUCAPE is around 1000 J/kg and deep-layer
shear around 50 knots across the thunderstorm cluster now, but drops
off to around 1000 J/kg and 30-40 knots as the cluster approaches
western Georgia.

As the thunderstorms move east, the lack of clarity of the MCV
evolution and a slightly less favorable environment results in
uncertainty as to whether a severe thunderstorm watch will be needed
downstream. Conditions will continue to be monitored for potential
watch issuance.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 285
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
815 AM EDT Sun May 18 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Eastern Alabama
  North-Central Georgia

* Effective this Sunday morning and afternoon from 815 AM until
  100 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A fast-moving cluster of strong to severe thunderstorms
will likely continue eastward from eastern Alabama into Georgia this
morning.  Scattered damaging gusts (55-70 mph) will be the primary
severe hazard, but large hail may accompany the stronger
thunderstorms as well.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 45
statute miles north and south of a line from 25 miles south of
Anniston AL to 45 miles northeast of Macon GA. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU5).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 284...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
27045.
