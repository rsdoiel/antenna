<h2>
What Is Theme in Writing?
</h2>
<p>
A theme is the underlying message or larger idea that a piece of writing
is conveying. Themes in stories are often associated with a moral or the
reader’s takeaway from what has occurred in the narrative. However, a
theme can sometimes simply reflect some truth or observation about life
and society without any judgement.

Seyfu Hinds explores Steampunk and Identity in ‘Washington Black’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-28, from: Final Draft blog</p>

When Selwyn Seyfu Hinds first picked up the award-winning novel
<em>Washington Black</em> by Esi Edugyan, he was on a break during the
holidays in his homeland of Guyana. “I have a longstanding rule not to
read material over Christmas,” he says. But Ellen Goldsmith-Vein,
producer of <em>The Maze Runner</em> films, convinced him to break that
rule. He was glad he did.<br><br>“The book was just astonishing,” says
Hinds. The journey of a young Caribbean boy navigating trauma, identity,
and freedom deeply resonated with Hinds’ own experience immigrating to
America at 14. <br><br>“The emotional arc felt the same,” he says.
“Learning new ecosystems, new languages and new people – understanding
the opportunities and the dangers in the place that you exist. And all
of it on your road to finding your agency, finding your method, finding
love, you know, finding your existential self. All of that came together
and I said this is something that I have to
write.” <br><br><em>Washington Black</em> is now a lush, genre-bending
TV series on Hulu, executive produced by Hinds, who also serves as
showrunner. It’s a steampunk reimagining of the 19th century from a
perspective rarely seen on screen. Set in the early 1800s, it follows
George Washington “Wash” Black (Eddie Karanja), a boy born into slavery
on a Barbados plantation. After an unfortunate event endangers his life,
he flees with British explorer Titch (Tom Ellis), embarking on a
globe-spanning journey that takes him into adulthood. <br><br>The series
weaves back and forth between 20-something Wash (Ernest Kingsley
Junior), with flashbacks to Young Wash, delving into matters of race,
resilience and a young America. Actor Sterling K. Brown even has a
supporting role and serves as Executive Producer. But it’s the
unexpected playfulness and optimism that the steampunk tropes – like the
depiction of fantastic steam-powered flying machines – that really make
it extraordinary.
