## The 32bit RISC OS needs to be ported to 64bit to survive, seeks help

date: 2025-03-30, from: OS News

RISC OS, the operating system from the United Kingdom originally designed to run on Acorn Computer&#8217;s Archimedes computers &#8211; the first ARM computers &#8211; is still actively developed today. Especially since the introduction of the Raspberry Pi, new life was breathed into this ageing operating system, and it has gained quite a bit of steady momentum ever since, with tons of small updates, applications, and new hardware support, including things like support for wireless networking. This development has always been a bit piecemeal, though, and the pace has never been exceptionally fast. Now, though, time really is ticking for RISC OS: popular RISC OS platforms like the Raspberry Pi are moving to 64bit ARM only, and this poses a big problem for RISC OS: most of it is written in pure 32bit ARM assembly. As you can imagine, the supply of capable 32bit ARM boards is going to dwindle over the coming years, which would put RISC OS right back where it was before the launch of the Raspberry Pi: floundering, relying on old hardware. This is obviously not ideal, and as such, RISC OS Open Limited wants to take a big leap to address this. Since 2011, ROOL has successfully delivered dozens of community-funded improvements through its bounty scheme. While this model has enabled steady progress, it is not suited to the scale of work now required to modernise RISC OS. The Moonshots initiative represents a fundamental shift: focused, multi-year development projects undertaken by full-time engineers. The first Moonshot aims to make the RISC OS source code portable and compatible with 64-bit Arm platforms, a prerequisite for future hardware support. ROOL has already scoped the work, identified key milestones, and built cost models based on realistic employment and project management needs. ↫ Steve Revill in a ROOL press release They&#8217;re going to need a dedicated team of several developers working over the course of several years to port RISC OS to 64bit ARM. That&#8217;s going to require quite a bit of money, manpower, and expertise, and considering ROOL has only collected about £100000 worth of donations over the past 14 years, I can see why they&#8217;re aiming to go big for this effort. All these giant technology corporations with trillion dollar stock valuations are currently relying on ARM technology, so you&#8217;d think they could empty a few socks and cough up a few million to get this effort funded properly, but alas, we all know that&#8217;s not going to happen. I hope ROOL can make this work. RISC OS is a ton of fun to use, and occupies a unique place in computing history. I would be incredibly sad to see technological progress leave it behind, when what amount to chump change for so many wealthy companies and individuals could save it.

## Microsoft makes it even harder to use a local account on Windows 11

date: 2025-03-30, from: OS News

Do you want to install Windows 11 without internet access or without an online Microsoft Account? It seems Microsoft really doesn&#8217;t want you to, as it has removed a very common and popular way of bypassing this requirement. In the release notes for the latest builds from the Dev and Beta channels, the company notes: We’re removing the bypassnro.cmd script from the build to enhance security and user experience of Windows 11. This change ensures that all users exit setup with internet connectivity and a Microsoft Account. Let me blow your minds and state that I don&#8217;t think online accounts for an operating system are inherently a bad idea. I would love it if I could install Fedora KDE on a new machine, optionally log into some online &#8220;Fedora Account&#8221;, and have my customisations and applications synchronise automatically. It would save me some time and effort, and assuming it&#8217;s all properly encrypted and secured, I don&#8217;t think the risk factors are particularly high. The keyword here is, of course, optionally. Microsoft wants every Windows 11 user to have a Microsoft Account instead of a local account, and would rather not make it optional at all. Of course, this is still Microsoft, a company wholly incapable of doing anything right when it comes to operating systems, so even making this script available again during installation is stupidly easy. It took a few nerds mere moments to discover you could just make some registry changes during installation, reboot, and have the script return to its rightful place. Oh Microsoft. Never change.

## Blue95: Fedora Atomic Xfce converted to a Windows 95 desktop

date: 2025-03-30, from: OS News

Blue95 is a modern and lightweight desktop experience that is reminiscent of a bygone era of computing. Based on Fedora Atomic Xfce with the Chicago95 theme. ↫ Blue95 GitHub page Exactly as it says on the tin. This is by far the easiest way to get the excellent Chigaco95 theme for Xfce set up and working in a polished way, and it also contains a few different application choices from the regular Fedora Xfce desktop to improve the illusion even further.

## Microsoft releases Windows 11 roadmap tool to help make sense of Windows 11’s development

date: 2025-03-30, from: OS News

I&#8217;ve complained about the utter inscrutability of the Windows release process for a long time, with Microsoft seemingly using channels, build numbers, code names, date-based version numbers, and so on interchangeably, making it incredibly hard to keep track of what is being released when. It turns out even Microsoft itself started losing track, because it&#8217;s now released a roadmap for Windows 11 development. In the roadmap tool &#8211; of course it&#8217;s a tool &#8211; you can select a platform, which isn&#8217;t x86 or ARM, but Windows PC or Copilot+ PC, a version (23H2 or 24H2 for now), a status (In preview, Gradually rolling out, or Generally available), and a channel (Canary, Dev, Beta, or Retail), after which the roadmap tool will list whatever features match those criteria. Do you now see why people might want such a tool to keep track of what the hell is going on with Windows? Anyway, as the date-based version numbers &#8211; 23H2 and 24H2 &#8211; may already make clear, this seems more like a roadmap about where development&#8217;s been than where development&#8217;s going. The problem for Microsoft, of course, is that it maintains several different Windows variants with different feature sets and update schedules, and users, too, can of course opt to stick to certain versions before moving on. The end result is this spaghetti, which makes it hard to untangle when you&#8217;re getting which feature. Anyway, if you&#8217;re elbow-deep in the Windows spaghetti, this tool may be of use to you.
