## Executive orders: The presidential power

date: 2025-01-27, from: VOA News USA

The U.S. government consists of three branches designed to keep each other in check, with Congress responsible for passing legislation. But presidents have some power to unilaterally direct government policy by using executive orders.

## DeepSeek's 'Sputnik moment' prompts investors to sell big AI players

date: 2025-01-27, from: VOA News USA

LONDON/SINGAPORE — Investors hammered technology stocks on Monday, sending the likes of Nvidia and Oracle plummeting, as the emergence of a low-cost Chinese artificial intelligence model cast doubts on Western companies' dominance in this sector. 


Startup DeepSeek last week launched a free assistant it says uses less data at a fraction of the cost of incumbent players' models, possibly marking a turning point in the level of investment needed for AI.  


Futures on the Nasdaq 100 slid almost 4%, suggesting the index could see its biggest daily slide since September 2022 later on Monday, if those losses are sustained. 


Those on the S&P 500 dropped 2%. Shares in AI chipmaker Nvidia fell more than 11%, rival Oracle dropped 8.5% and AI data analytics company Palantir lost 6.5% in pre-market trading.  


DeepSeek, which by Monday had overtaken U.S. rival ChatGPT in terms of downloads on the Apple Store, offers the prospect of a viable, cheaper AI alternative which has raised questions about the sustainability of the level of spending and investment on AI by Western companies, including Apple and Microsoft.  


From Tokyo to Amsterdam, shares in AI players tumbled. 


"We still don’t know the details and nothing has been 100% confirmed in regards to the claims, but if there truly has been a breakthrough in the cost to train models from $100 million+ to this alleged $6 million number this is actually very positive for productivity and AI end users as cost is obviously much lower meaning lower cost of access," Jon Withaar, a senior portfolio manager at Pictet Asset Management, said. 


The hype around AI has powered a huge inflow of capital into the equity markets in the last 18 months in particular, as investors have bought into the technology, inflating company valuations and sending stock markets to record highs. 


Little is known about the small Hangzhou startup behind DeepSeek. Its researchers wrote in a paper last month that the DeepSeek-V3 model, launched on Jan. 10, used Nvidia's H800 chips for training, spending less than $6 million - the figure referenced by Pictet's Withaar. 


H800 chips are not top-of-the-line. Initially developed as a reduced-capability product to get around restrictions on sales to China, they were subsequently banned by U.S. sanctions. 


'Sputnik moment'  


Marc Andreessen, the Silicon Valley venture capitalist, said in a post on X on Sunday that DeepSeek's R1 model was AI's "Sputnik moment," referencing the former Soviet Union's launch of a satellite that marked the start of the space race in the late 1950s. 


"Deepseek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen — and as open source, a profound gift to the world," he said in a separate post.  


In Europe, ASML which counts Taiwan's TSMC, Intel and Samsung as its customers, dropped almost 7.5%, while Siemens Energy lost nearly 18%. In Japan, startup investor SoftBank Group slid more than 8%. Last week it announced a $19 billion commitment to fund Stargate, a data-center joint venture with OpenAI. 


Given the volatility, investors sought out safe-havens such as U.S. Treasuries, which pushed 10-year yields down nearly 10 basis points to 4.52%, while low-yielding currencies like the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc soared against the dollar.  


Big Tech has ramped up spending on developing AI capabilities and optimism over the possible returns has driven stock valuations sky-high. 


Nvidia alone has risen by over 200% in about 18 months and trades at 56 times the value of its earnings, compared with a 53% rise in the Nasdaq .IXIC, which trades at a multiple of 16 to the value of its constituents' earnings, according to LSEG data. 


Nick Ferres, chief investment officer at Vantage Point Asset Management in Singapore said the market was questioning the capex spend of the major tech companies. 


Masahiro Ichikawa, chief market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management said: "The idea that the most cutting-edge technologies in America, like Nvidia and ChatGPT, are the most superior globally, there's concern that this perspective might start to change."  


"I think it might be a bit premature," Ichikawa said.

## Trump Takes Aim at FEMA

The council will have no more than 20 members, and will include department heads as well as people from outside the government that are appointed by Trump himself. “These non-Federal members shall have diverse perspectives and expertise in disaster relief and assistance, emergency preparedness, natural disasters, Federal-State relationships, and budget management,” the order states. This new council will be tasked with scrutinizing the agency’s disaster relief efforts and making recommendations for improvement. Trump has slammed FEMA and the prior administration for their responses to recent natural disasters, including Hurricane Helene and the wildfires in Los Angeles. <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/hurricane-misinformation-climate-denial?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9QPplDDxylScr44AHywPZZps2y8UJw32xkOgQs1PmN7IQAPvYjPcH8dhdZtQP7lX6iwCxk" target="_self">Misinformation</a> and <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/los-angeles-fires-misinformation?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9QPplDDxylScr44AHywPZZps2y8UJw32xkOgQs1PmN7IQAPvYjPcH8dhdZtQP7lX6iwCxk" target="_self">conspiracy theories</a> – often floated by Republican politicians and rightwing figureheads – spread quickly in the wake of both emergencies.

## The Defense Department Still Needs Climate Tech

date: 2025-01-27, from: Heatmap News

Federal funding can play a critical role in helping companies scale up and build out first-of-a-kind projects and facilities. So how to work with a government hostile to one of these startups’ core value propositions: aiding in the energy transition?</p>
<p>Talk of clean tech and electrification may be out of vogue, but its utility is not. The potential of many of these companies goes beyond mitigating climate change and into the realm of energy security and resilience — something the Department of Defense is well aware of. </p>
<p>The White House’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/climate" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate webpage has gone dark</u></a>, but the Department of Defense’s <a href="https://www.climate.mil/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate resilience portal</u></a> is up and running (at least for now). As the site reads, “The changing climate is <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-national-security" target="_self"><u>one of many threat multipliers</u></a> to National Security, which adds complexity to Department of Defense decisions.” That’s a major reason why this agency can’t stop, won’t stop funding climate technologies. Another reason is that many technologies that happen to be good for the planet might also simply be the best tool for the job, meaning the DOD need not utter the word “climate” at all when justifying its decision to deploy new solutions. </p>
<p>“The Defense Department, so far in our experience, has framed things largely in terms of alternative benefits that our technology can have, such as fuel supply chain redundancy and reliability,” Ted McKlveen, co-founder and CEO of the hydrogen storage company Verne, told me. Verne received a $250,000 Small Business Innovation Research <a href="https://www.verneh2.com/news-article/verne-receives-award-to-develop-cryo-compressed-hydrogen-solutions-for-the-u-s-army" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>grant from the Army</u></a> last May to work on the development of hydrogen vehicles. </p>
<p>Cindy Taff, CEO of the next-generation geothermal startup Sage Geosystems, told me something similar. “What the military likes to talk about is energy resilience,” she said, though she has heard the DOD tout the climate benefits of her company’s tech, too. Sage currently has multiple DOD engagements, including feasibility studies with both the <a href="https://www.sagegeosystems.com/sage-geosystems-to-advance-energy-resilience-with-geothermal-energy-solutions-at-fort-bliss/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Army</u></a> and <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241003555153/en/Sage-Geosystems-Expands-Collaboration-with-the-DoD-to-Enhance-Energy-Resilience-through-Geothermal-Energy-at-Naval-Air-Station-Corpus-Christi" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Navy</u></a> and a $1.9 million grant to build a demonstration project for the <a href="https://www.afmc.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/3915653/air-force-awards-contract-to-test-clean-power-plant-technology/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Air Force</u></a>.</p>
<p>That’s not to say it’s clear what the Department of Defense’s funding priorities under Trump will be. When I contacted the DOD in mid-December to request an interview for this story, a spokesperson initially told me they would help connect me to the right person. But as Trump’s inauguration drew nearer, I got a message saying the agency would have to hold off until it got more guidance, as “it remains to be seen in the next few weeks what direction the new administration is going.<em><em>”</em></em></p>
<p>Regardless of how the priorities shake out, practically every climate-focused company and venture capitalist I talk to emphasizes that their companies will only succeed if they can make or invest in products that can compete on economics and/or quality alone, sans government support. That was true even before a second Trump turn in the White House started to look like an inevitability, and this new administration will at least partially reveal which companies can do that. But while everybody <em><em>aims </em></em>to be independent of federal support, they might not actually <em><em>need</em></em> to say goodbye to that funding stream, so long as they can tout their economic and performance benefits to the right customers.</p>
<p>Take Pyka, for example. When Michael Norcia co-founded the autonomous electric aircraft company in 2017, the ultimate goal was to design a passenger plane. “We want that to be our legacy, but we were also very, very realistic about the challenges associated with actually doing that,” he told me. So when the DOD took an interest in the company’s commercial cargo planes and their potential ability to deliver supplies in contested environments, the startup jumped at the opportunity, delivering its first aircraft to AFWERX, the innovation arm of the Department of the Air Force, early last year. Interest from such a lucrative government customer helped the company to close its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/23/pyka-fields-interest-from-defense-as-40m-round-goes-to-scaling-up-its-electric-autonomous-planes/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$40 million Series B</u></a> round in September.</p>
<p>Of course, the decarbonization benefits of electrifying military cargo delivery would be huge. But unsurprisingly, Norcia told me that the DOD primarily frames the opportunity in terms of the capabilities of all-electric or hybrid-electric planes, which could take a variety of fuels, operate quietly, and give off minimal heat, making them more difficult to detect via thermal imaging. Plus, the more equipment is electrified the better, “in terms of having them be able to operate in a highly contested environment, where moving fuel around maybe is not feasible,” Norcia explained. Not to mention the fact that if a manned aircraft is shot down, people die, meaning that in a counterfactual sense, Pyka’s tech is saving lives. </p>
<p>Verne’s North Star is also decarbonization. And given that the military is the world’s largest oil consumer, McKlveen was excited to partner with the Army to put its hydrogen storage tech to use in medium and heavy-duty vehicles. The company stores hydrogen (ideally green hydrogen, produced via renewables-powered electrolysis) at high density as a cold, compressed gas, making it possible to build hydrogen vehicles with greater range and lower cost than has traditionally been done. Similar to Pyka, the Army is enthused that these vehicles would be difficult for adversaries to detect, as they’re quiet and give off little heat. Likewise, McKlveen told me that hydrogen power could replace the Army’s notoriously noisy generators. </p>
<p>While Verne has also partnered with the <a href="https://www.verneh2.com/news-article/verne-receives-award-through-doe-commercialization-support-program" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Department of Energy</u></a> and its R&D arm, <a href="https://arpa-e.energy.gov/programs-and-initiatives/search-all-projects/decoupling-high-density-hydrogen-liquid-hydrogen-infrastructure-catalyst-filled-heat-exchangers-modular-cryo-compressors" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ARPA-E</u></a>, McKlveen said that working with the DOD has been unique in a few ways. “The key difference is the DOD is a customer and a grant provider. So they can say both what their needs are as a potential customer and represent a potential customer,” he explained. This, along with the agency’s clear, phased approach that it puts companies through, helps bring a level of transparency to the whole process, from pilot to full-fledged military implementation, that McKlveen appreciates. </p>
<p>And lest we forget, “they also have a very large budget,” he told me. For fiscal year 2025, the DOD has requested <a href="https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/fy24_ndaa_conference_executive_summary1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$849.8 billion</u></a>, while the DOE, by comparison, has requested a mere <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-03/doe-fy-2025-budget-in-brief-v2.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$51.4 billion</u></a>. </p>
<p>“I find military people to be get-it-done type of people,” Taff of Sage Geosystems told me. “So I think that helps to create a sense of urgency and also push things along a lot faster than you would see with maybe other organizations.” Sage uses drilling technologies adopted from the oil and gas industry to access heat for clean electricity production across a wide variety of geographies. This is an especially attractive option for the DOD as the majority of geothermal infrastructure is underground, and thus well protected from attack. And unlike other renewables, this tech can provide 24/7 energy no matter the weather conditions. So it’s no surprise that the military is pouring money into this sector, pursuing partnerships with other big names in the geothermal space such as <a href="https://www.diu.mil/latest/three-additional-next-generation-geothermal-technology-companies-advancing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Fervo Energy</u></a> and <a href="https://www.eavor.com/press-releases/u-s-defense-department-awards-eavor-contract-to-power-military-base-through-advanced-geothermal-system/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Eavor.</u></a></p>
<p>Electric planes, hydrogen, and geothermal all felt intuitively justifiable to me from a defense standpoint, but I was more surprised to learn that the DOD has gotten into the alternative proteins, a.k.a. “fake meat”, industry. Though meat substitutes won’t power tankers or keep the lights on, the Defense Department’s <a href="https://www.fooddive.com/news/better-meat-awarded-grant-department-of-defense/725392/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$1.4 million grant</u></a> to The Better Meat Co. is intended to strengthen the American supply chain. China’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs views <a href="https://time.com/6143109/china-future-of-cultivated-meat/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>lab-grown meat as critical</u></a> to its five-year agricultural plan. “So we don’t want to have the United States be importing clean protein in the way that we’re currently dependent on Asia for our semiconductors and photovoltaics,” Paul Shapiro, the company’s CEO, told me. </p>
<p>The Better Meat Co. produces a protein called Rhiza that’s derived from microscopic fungi, which it then sells as an ingredient to other companies to make either 100% animal-free meat or a meat blend. “This isn’t an alternative protein program. It’s a <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3878835/dod-releases-seven-awards-for-distributed-bioindustrial-manufacturing-program/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>domestic biomanufacturing program</u></a>,” Shapiro told me when I asked if military funding for meat substitutes could be <a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/lab-grown-meat-trump-rfk" target="_self"><u>at risk under Trump</u></a>. Looking at some of the other companies that got grants through the same program, he said, “it’s literally like bio manufacturing things for military planes and jet lubricants and chemical catalysts for bullets.” That is, probably not Republican targets for defunding. “It’s clearly solely about wanting the U.S. to be a leader in biomanufacturing for the products that the world is going to depend on in the future.”</p>
<p>The DOD also sees promise in numerous other clean energy technologies, including <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/nuclear-microreactors-radiant-westinghouse-bwx-technologies" target="_self"><u>nuclear microreactors</u></a> for their portability and ability to provide off-grid energy in remote locations and <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/northvolt-lyten-zeta" target="_self"><u>alternate battery chemistries</u></a> that could help the U.S. move away from a dependence on Chinese-produced lithium-ion batteries.</p>
<p>But despite the deep well of funding and pragmatic approach to deployment that the Department of Defense offers, agreeing to work with the DOD isn’t always an obvious choice. Many fear their company’s tech could be used in ways and in wars that they oppose. In 2018, for example, thousands of Google employees <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/files/2018/technology/googleletter.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>signed a letter opposing the company’s participation in Project Maven</u></a>, a partnership with the Pentagon that uses artificial intelligence to improve the accuracy of drone strikes. Supporters of the project said it would lead to fewer civilian deaths, while protestors argued that Google “should not be in the business of war.” Google did not renew the contract. More recently, employees at <a href="http://www.notechforapartheid.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Microsoft, Google, and Amazon</u></a> have signed petitions opposing their company’s provision of cloud computing and AI services to the Israeli government.</p>
<p>Norcia noted that most, but not all of his employees were neutral to positive when it came to working with the Air Force, while “for a small minority of the company, it unfortunately was not something that they really wanted to devote their life to.” While he understands that perspective, Norcia does believe that Pyka’s work with the DOD is a net positive for the world. “If you assume wars are going to keep happening — which, unfortunately, I think is the reality — I’d rather have it be the case that they’re more of a robot war than a human war,” he told me. And at the end of the day, passenger planes are still the goal.</p>
<p>As for his team at Verne, McKlveen told me everybody was on board. “The Defense Department has led to some of the biggest innovations of the last century, whether that’s the internet or GPS. And our team knows that.” Plus, even if the DOD doesn’t talk much about the climate benefits of sustainability-focused tech, that doesn’t negate them. <a href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/Pentagon%20Fuel%20Use%2C%20Climate%20Change%20and%20the%20Costs%20of%20War%20Revised%20November%202019%20Crawford.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>A 2019 study</u></a> revealed that the Pentagon purchases an average of 100 million barrels of oil per year, so from that perspective, “it’s hard to find a bigger customer that we can address,” McKlveen told me. </p>
<p>Norcia agreed. “I think the gains of your impact get turned way up if you’re doing work with the DOD,” he said, “as opposed to, you know, building an app that makes something incrementally more efficient or more addictive.”</p>

## Percival Everett's 'James' awarded Carnegie Medal for fiction

date: 2025-01-27, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — For author Percival Everett, libraries have long been a source of knowledge and discovery and pleasure, even of the forbidden kind.


"I remember making friends at age 13 with the librarian at the University of South Carolina, and she used to let me go through the stacks when I wasn't supposed to," Everett, who spent part of his childhood in Columbia, said during a telephone interview Sunday.


"One of the wonderful things about libraries is that when you're looking for one book, it's surrounded by other books that may not be connected to it. That's what you get (online) with links, but (in libraries) no one's decided what the links are."


Everett's latest honor comes from the country's public libraries. On Sunday, the American Library Association announced that Everett's "James" was this year's winner of the Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction, which includes a $5,000 cash award. Kevin Fedarko's "A Walk in the Park: The True Story of a Spectacular Misadventure in the Grand Canyon" was chosen for nonfiction.


Everett's acclaimed reworking of Mark Twain's "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" from the perspective of Jim, Huck Finn's enslaved companion, has already received the National Book Award and the Kirkus Prize and is a finalist for a National Book Critics Circle award. "James" has even topped The New York Times fiction hardcover list, a rare feat in recent years for a literary work that wasn't a major book club pick or movie tie-in.


"Percival Everett has written a modern masterpiece, a beautiful and important work that offers a fresh perspective from the eyes of a classic character," Allison Escoto, chair of the award's selection committee, said in a statement. "Kevin Fedarko's unforgettable journey through the otherworldly depths of the Grand Canyon shows us the triumphs and pitfalls of exploration and illuminates the many vital lessons we can all learn from our precious natural world."


Fedarko is a former Time magazine correspondent whose work also has appeared in The New York Times and Esquire. A Pittsburgh native fascinated by distant places, Fedarko has a long history with libraries — Carnegie libraries. He remembers visiting two while growing up, notably one in the suburb of Oakmont near the hairdressing salon his parents ran. He would read biographies of historical figures from George Washington to Daniel Boone, and otherwise think of libraries as "important threads running through his life," windows to a "wider world."


Now a resident of Flagstaff, Arizona, Fedarko says that he relied in part on the library at the nearby Northern Arizona University campus for both "A Walk in the Park" and its predecessor, also about the Grand Canyon, "The Emerald Mile."


"The library has an important and unique collection about the Grand Canyon, and it's the backbone of the kind of history that helps form the framework of both books," he says. "Neither of them could have been done without the library."


Previous winners of the medals, established in 2012 with a grant from the Carnegie Corporation of New York, includes Donna Tartt's "The Goldfinch," Colson Whitehead's "The Underground Railroad" and Doris Kearns Goodwin's "The Bully Pulpit."


This year's finalists besides "James" in the fiction category were Jiaming Tang's "Cinema Love" and Kavin Akbar's "Martyr!"


Adam Higginbotham's "Challenger: A True Story of Heroism and Disaster on the Edge of Space" and Emily Nussbaum's "Cue the Sun! The Invention of Reality TV" were the nonfiction runners-up.


All three fiction nominees were published by Penguin Random House and all three nonfiction finalists by Simon & Schuster.

## Mel Gibson’s ‘Flight Risk’ is No. 1 at box office, ‘The Brutalist’ expands

date: 2025-01-26, from: VOA News USA

New York — Critics lambasted it and audiences didn’t grade it much better. But despite the turbulence, Mel Gibson’s “Flight Risk” managed to open No. 1 at the box office with a modest $12 million, according to studio estimates Sunday. 


On a quiet weekend, even for the typically frigid movie-going month of January, the top spot went to the Lionsgate thriller starring Mark Wahlberg as a pilot flying an Air Marshal (Michelle Dockery) and fugitive (Topher Grace) across Alaska. But it wasn’t a particularly triumphant result for Gibson’s directorial follow-up to 2016’s “Hacksaw Ridge.” Reviews (21% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and audience scores (a “C” CinemaScore) were terrible. 


President Donald Trump recently named Gibson a “special ambassador” to Hollywood, along with Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone. 


Going into the weekend, Hollywood’s attention was more focused on the Sundance Film Festival and on Thursday’s Oscar nominations, which were twice postponed by the wildfires in the Los Angeles region. 


The weekend was also a small test as to whether the once more common Oscar “bump” that can sometimes follow nominations still exists. Most contenders have by now completed the bulk of their theatrical runs and are more likely to see an uptick on VOD or streaming. 


But the weekend’s most daring gambit was A24 pushing Brady Corbet’s “The Brutalist” a three–and-a-half-hour epic nominated for 10 Academy Awards, into wide release. Though some executives initially greeted “The Brutalist,” which is running with an intermission, as “un-distributable,” Corbet has said, A24 acquired the film out of the Venice Film Festival and it’s managed solid business, collecting $6 million in limited release. 


In wide release, it earned $2.9 million — a far from blockbuster sum but the best weekend yet for “The Brutalist.” 


The audience was downright miniscule for another best-picture nominee: RaMell Ross’ “Nickel Boys.” Innovatively shot almost entirely in first-person POV, the Amazon MGM Studios release gathered just $340,171 in 540 locations after expanding by 300 theaters. 


Coming off one of the lowest Martin Luther King Jr. weekends in years, no new releases made a major impact. 


Steven Soderbergh’s “Presence,” a well-reviewed horror film shot from the perspective of a ghost inside a suburban home, debuted with $3.4 million in 1,750 locations. The film, released by Neon and acquired out of last year’s Sundance, was made for just $2 million. 


The top spots otherwise went to holdovers. The Walt Disney Co.’s “Mufasa: The Lion King,” in its sixth weekend of release, scored $8.7 million to hold second place. After starting slowly, the Barry Jenkins-directed film has amassed $626.7 million globally. 


“One of Them Days,” the Keke Palmer and SZA-led comedy from Sony Pictures, held well in its second weekend, dropping just 32% with $8 million in ticket sales. In recent years, few comedies have found success on the big screen, but “One of Them Days” has proven an exception. 


Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 


1. “Flight Risk,” $12 million. 


2. “Mufasa: The Lion King,” $8.7 million. 


3. “One of Them Days,” $8 million. 


4. “Sonic the Hedgehog 3,” $5.5 million. 


5. “Moana 2,” $4.3 million. 


6. “Presence,” $3.4 million. 


7. “Wolf Man,” $3.4 million. 


8. “A Complete Unknown,” $3.1 million. 


9. “Den of Thieves 2: Pantera,” $3 million. 


10. “The Brutalist,” $2.9 million.

## US, Colombia reach migrant deportation deal after tariff threats

date: 2025-01-26, from: VOA News USA

The White House announced late Sunday the United States was backing off a series of retaliatory measures levied against Colombia, saying the two countries had reached an agreement on U.S. flights sending Colombian migrants back home.


A White House statement said the two countries agreed Colombia would accept its migrants without restriction, including having them sent back on U.S. military aircraft.  


Colombian President Gustavo Petro had earlier rejected two U.S. military planes and said he would only accept migrants when the U.S. treated them with dignity, including using civilian planes for deportations.


The White House also said it would hold new tariffs and sanctions against Colombia “in reserve, and not signed, unless Colombia fails to honor this agreement.”




State Department visa sanctions against several Colombian officials, as well as enhanced customs inspections would remain in place until the first planeload of Colombian migrants lands in Colombia, the White House said.


Colombia’s Foreign Ministry said late Sunday it had overcome the impasse with the United States, and that Foreign Minister Luis Gilberto Murillo and Colombian Ambassador to the U.S. Dnaiel García-Peña were traveling to Washington for high-level meetings to follow up on the agreement.


Colombia said it would welcome its people home and would guarantee them decent conditions as citizens with rights.


The statements reversed a fast-evolving series of escalatory statements from the leaders of the two countries, which featured U.S. President Donald Trump announcing an immediate 25% tariff on Colombian goods, which would rise to 50% in a week, and the suspension of visa processing at the U.S. Embassy in Bogota.


 




Petro announced a 25% tariff on U.S. goods in return, saying the United States “will never rule us."


“A migrant is not a criminal and must be treated with the dignity that a human being deserves,” Petro said. “That is why I returned the U.S. military planes that were carrying Colombian migrants. ... In civilian planes, without being treated like criminals, we will receive our fellow citizens."


Colombia is America's third-largest trading partner in Latin America.


The row came about after U.S. authorities began arresting hundreds of undocumented migrants per day and sending them back to their home countries, carrying out Trump’s 2024 campaign pledge to deport masses of migrants who have illegally entered the United States.


“We’re going to enforce immigration laws,” Vice President JD Vance told CBS News’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday.


More than 1,000 migrants were arrested with hundreds repatriated to other countries, including Guatemala last week, during the first days of the new Trump administration, according to figures compiled by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and the White House.  


Watch related report by Veronica Balderas Iglesias:




U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said it made 956 arrest nationwide Sunday.


It did not specify how many were part of an operation focused in the Chicago area that was witnessed by several top Trump administration officials, including “border czar” Tom Homan.


ICE said in a statement it worked with other federal agencies to conduct “enhanced targeted operations today in Chicago to enforce U.S. immigration law and preserve public safety and national security by keeping potentially dangerous criminal aliens out of our communities.”


Homan told ABC’s “This Week” show Sunday, “There will be more arrests nationwide.” 




Trump authorized sending 1,500 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, and Homan said, “You’ll see the numbers increase. They’re down there to create a secure border.”


He said the U.S. is deporting “as many as we can” arrest, with the focus first on those convicted of U.S. crimes and then moving on to detain and deport those whose asylum requests have been rejected by U.S. officials.


“We’re in the beginning stages,” Homan said.


About 11 million undocumented migrants are believed to be living in the U.S., a staggering number that most officials believe will be impossible to deport.


Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a staunch Trump ally, urged his Republican colleagues in Congress to authorize more spending for the deportation effort.


“We haven't given the Trump team the resources,” Graham said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” show. He said Homan “needs to substantially hire more [immigration] agents. He needs to finish the [border] wall [with Mexico] and technology. He needs to go from 41,000 detention beds to 150,000 detention beds to make this work.”


“So, to my Republican colleagues, particularly in the House [of Representatives], as we fiddle, our immigration plans are hitting walls. We're not building walls, we're hitting walls. We need to give Tom Homan the money now to execute the plan that he's come up with. And without congressional funding this is going to hit a wall,” Graham declared.


The Trump administration has stopped taking appointments for migrants waiting in Mexico to request asylum through a mobile app, but Trump’s anti-immigration edicts are facing legal challenges. One judge has already temporarily blocked Trump from declaring that he no longer recognizes constitutionally guaranteed citizenship for children of undocumented migrants born in the United States.


Some material for this article came from The Associated Press and Reuters.

## As Hegseth takes charge at Pentagon, here are what changes could be in store

date: 2025-01-26, from: VOA News USA

Washington — When Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth starts his first official day on Monday morning, he will face a daunting array of issues to tackle — from global conflicts and border security to administrative tasks. 


At the top of his list is addressing President Donald Trump's priority to strengthen the U.S. military presence along the southern border and reviewing whether active-duty forces should be used for law enforcement — something done rarely. 


Dozens of other issues will compete for his attention, including developing the Pentagon's massive budget, decisions about aid to Ukraine, support for the ceasefire in Gaza, troop deployments in the Middle East. Not to mention Trump directives to rid the federal government of diversity programs and personnel as well as moves to cut waste and remove any lingering Biden administration backers. 


In a message to the force shortly after he was sworn in Saturday, Hegseth cited the challenges he sees ahead. Some are ones his predecessors also faced, such as reorienting the military from decades of a Middle East focus and better deterring China. Continued conflict in the region, including the October 2023 attack on Israel by Hamas, has made that shift impossible to execute. 


Hegseth also told service members about other priorities, including strengthening the defense industrial base and getting the Pentagon to pass an audit, while ensuring that the United States remains “the strongest and most lethal force in the world." 


He made an unannounced stop to the Pentagon on Saturday after the swearing-in ceremony at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. There was no media coverage of his arrival. The Pentagon later released an official photo saying Hegseth was “ready to get to work on behalf of America’s warriors.” 


Already, support staff have been meeting with military leaders, including Gen. CQ Brown Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But Hegseth will get to experience what many describe as “drinking from a firehose” as he works to quickly get up to speed on what his 2.1 million service members and 780,000 civilians in the department are doing. Among them are tens of thousands serving overseas, including in combat zones. 


Then there are the cultural issues that Hegseth railed on as a media personality that did not make it into Hegseth’s message to the military. Many expect they will surface in the coming days. 


Here are some key issues that Hegseth, who was confirmed in a tiebreaking vote Friday by Vice President JD Vance, will face right away: 


Border deployments 


In trying to meet Trump's demand of securing the border, Hegseth will face a barrage of information about what troops are available, what assistance the Border Patrol needs and where, as well as how to house, feed and transport the troops and border personnel and how to ensure none of this affects other national security requirements. 


One of his first big decisions is whether he will recommend that active-duty troops deployed to the border become involved in law enforcement, a move that military leaders in recent years have pushed to avoid. 


Active-duty forces are prohibited from doing law enforcement duties on U.S. soil under the Posse Comitatus Act. Trump has signed an executive order directing that his defense and homeland security secretaries report back within 90 days on whether they think he should invoke the 1807 law called the Insurrection Act, which allows troops to be used for civilian law enforcement on U.S. soil during emergencies. 


During previous deployments, troops have been used for transportation, intelligence, logistics, wall-building and other support tasks, freeing up the Border Patrol to interact with migrants and conduct the law enforcement duties.


Transgender troops


In his first executive order, Trump again stripped protections for transgender troops that Democratic President Joe Biden had restored after Trump banned those members from serving during his first term in office. 


The ban previously faced legal challenges, and lawyers who represented transgender forces last time are readying to take it up in the courts again. While Trump has not announced a ban, his decision to revoke protections is seen as a first step toward that. 


It is unclear how many troops would be affected. The Defense Department has no exact figure on the number of transgender troops serving because not every transgender person is in the same state of medical transition and not every transgender person identifies as such in military paperwork. 


The department has referred queries on how many transgender troops there are to the services; the services have said they have no way to track. 


The budget and Ukraine 


Hegseth will have to become familiar with the complicated construction of the Pentagon budget, which right now is about $850 billion. Trump ran on a vow to make the U.S. military more lethal — something Hegseth has echoed. But they also have spoken extensively about cutting waste. 


So Hegseth's imprint on the budget will be studied to determine how that's being done. 


Woven into those discussions will be security assistance to Ukraine. The State Department has ordered a freeze on new funding for almost all U.S. foreign aid, and there was no indication of a waiver for military assistance for Ukraine like there was for Israel and Egypt. 


The Biden administration provided Kyiv with more than $66 billion in military aid and weapons during the war with Russia. It had left unspent about $3.85 billion in congressionally authorized funding to send more weapons to Ukraine from existing U.S. stockpiles — a sum that is not affected by the foreign aid freeze. But it is now up to Hegseth and Trump to decide whether or not to spend it, and Trump hasn’t said what he will do on Ukraine aid.


Diversity, equity and inclusion rollbacks


Hegseth will take over the Pentagon's push to implement Trump's executive order to get rid of DEI programs, coming as military officers fret over whether they will be fired for being “woke," as Hegseth has pledged to do. 


During his Senate hearing, Hegseth affirmed his commitment to focus on lethality and to eliminate wokeness, arguing that DEI policies “divide” troops and do not prioritize “meritocracy.” 


Officials said the Defense Department doesn’t have any full-time workers assigned to DEI so they don’t expect to have to fire people, as other federal agencies have. 


But senior leaders have been poring over their websites to delete pages that mention diversity. Lacking clear guidance, staffers were pulling websites down in often inconsistent ways. The Army, for example, temporarily removed its sexual assault guidelines before they later came back online. 


Hegseth also has railed against women in combat in his books and on podcasts and said standards were lowered for them, which is not true. He has since toned down his criticism after substantial pushback from lawmakers. 


He most recently told senators that he's not aware that Trump wants to roll back the decision to allow women to serve in all combat jobs. Instead, he has talked about doing a review of standards.


Reproductive care


After the Supreme Court in 2022 ended constitutional protections for abortion that were set out in Roe v. Wade, then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin came out with a policy that would allow service members to take leave and be reimbursed for travel expenses to obtain reproductive care — including abortions and in-vitro fertilization — if the military base they were assigned to was in a state that had banned that care. 


It’s not clear whether Hegseth will seek to further revise that policy to remove the reimbursement provisions. It has been only scarcely used, and the department does not break down what the travel was for due to medical privacy laws.

## Thousands wait to return to northern Gaza, Trump urges Jordan, Egypt to take Palestinians

date: 2025-01-26, from: VOA News USA

Cairo  — Tens of thousands of Palestinians waited, blocked on the road, to return to their homes in northern Gaza on Sunday, voicing frustration after Israel accused Hamas of breaching a ceasefire agreement and refused to open crossing points. 


A day after a second exchange of Israeli hostages held in Gaza for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, the holdup underlined the risks hanging over the truce between the militant group and Israel, longtime adversaries in a series of Gaza wars. 


In central areas of Gaza, columns of people were waiting along the main roads leading north, some in vehicles and some on foot, witnesses said. 


"A sea of people is waiting for a signal to move back to Gaza City and the north, people are fed up and they want to go home," said Tamer Al-Burai, a displaced person from Gaza City. "This is the deal that was signed, isn't it?" 


"Many of those people have no idea whether their houses back home are still standing. But they want to go regardless, they want to put up the tents next to the rubble of their houses, they want to feel home," he told Reuters via a chat app. 


On Sunday, witnesses said many people had slept overnight on the Salahuddin Road, the main thoroughfare running north to south and on the coastal road leading north, waiting to go past the Israeli military positions in the Netzarim corridor running across the center of the Gaza Strip. 


Vehicles, trucks and rickshaws were overloaded with mattresses, food, and with the tents that used to shelter them for over a year in the central and southern areas of the enclave, and volunteers were distributing water and food. 


Under the agreement worked out with Egyptian and Qatari mediators and backed by the United States, Israel was meant to allow Palestinians displaced from the homes in the north to return to their homes. 


But Israel said that Hamas' failure to hand over a list detailing which of the hostages scheduled for release is alive or to hand over Arbel Yehud, an Israeli woman taken hostage during the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023 meant it had violated the agreement. 


As a result, checkpoints in the central Gaza Strip would not be opened to allow crossings into the northern Gaza Strip, it said in a statement. Hamas issued a statement accusing Israel of stalling and holding it responsible for the delay. 


'Demolition site' 


On Saturday, U.S. President Donald Trump instructed the U.S. military to release 2,000-pound bombs that his predecessor, Joe Biden, had ordered to be withheld from delivery to Israel over concern about their impact on the civilian population of Gaza. 


He also called on Egypt and Jordan to take on more Palestinians from Gaza either temporarily or permanently, saying "we should just clear out the whole thing." 


"It's literally a demolition site, almost everything is demolished and people are dying there," he told reporters after a call with Jordan's King Abdullah. 


An official of Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that runs Gaza, reacted with suspicion to the remarks, echoing longstanding Palestinian fears about being driven permanently from their homes. 


Palestinians "will not accept any offers or solutions, even if [such offers] appear to have good intentions under the guise of reconstruction, as announced in the proposals of U.S. President Trump," Basem Naim, a member of the Hamas political bureau, told Reuters. 


Al-Awda Hospital officials said four people were wounded by Israeli fire, from soldiers apparently trying to prevent people coming too close. 


The Israeli military issued warnings to Palestinians not to approach its positions in Gaza and said soldiers had fired warning shots on several occasions but said "as of now, we are unaware of any harm caused to the suspects as a result of the shooting."

## Trump discussing TikTok purchase with multiple people; decision in 30 days

date: 2025-01-26, from: VOA News USA

ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE — U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday he was in talks with multiple people over buying TikTok and would likely have a decision on the popular app's future in the next 30 days.


"I have spoken to many people about TikTok and there is great interest in TikTok," Trump told reporters on Air Force One during a flight to Florida.


Earlier in the day, Reuters reported two people with knowledge of the discussions said Trump's administration is working on a plan to save TikTok that involves tapping software company Oracle and a group of outside investors to effectively take control of the app's operations.


Under the deal being negotiated by the White House, TikTok's China-based owner, ByteDance, would retain a stake in the company, but data collection and software updates would be overseen by Oracle, which already provides the foundation of TikTok's Web infrastructure, one of the sources told Reuters.


However, in his comments to reporters on the flight, Trump said he had not spoken to Oracle's Larry Ellison about buying the app.


Asked if he was putting together a deal with Oracle and other investors to save TikTok, Trump said: "No, not with Oracle. Numerous people are talking to me, very substantial people, about buying it and I will make that decision probably over the next 30 days. Congress has given 90 days. If we can save TikTok, I think it would be a good thing."


The sources did say the terms of any potential deal with Oracle were fluid and likely to change. One source said the full scope of the discussions was not yet set and could include the U.S. operations as well as other regions.


National Public Radio on Saturday reported the deal talks for TikTok's global operations, citing two people with knowledge of the negotiations. Oracle had no immediate comment.


The deal being negotiated anticipates participation from ByteDance's current U.S. investors, according to the sources. Jeff Yass's Susquehanna International Group, General Atlantic, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Sequoia Capital are among ByteDance's U.S. backers.


Representatives for TikTok, ByteDance investors General Atlantic, KKR, Sequoia and Susquehanna could not immediately be reached for comment.


Others vying to acquire TikTok, including the investor group led by billionaire Frank McCourt and another involving Jimmy Donaldson, better known as the YouTube star Mr. Beast, are not part of the Oracle negotiation, one of the sources said.


Oracle responsible


Under the terms of the deal, Oracle would be responsible for addressing national security issues. TikTok initially struck a deal with Oracle in 2022 to store U.S. users' information to alleviate Washington's worries about Chinese government interference.


TikTok's management would remain in place, to operate the short video app, according to one of the sources.


The app, which is used by 170 million Americans, was taken offline temporarily for users shortly before a law that said it must be sold by ByteDance on national security grounds, or be banned, took effect on Jan. 19.


Trump, after taking office a day later, signed an executive order seeking to delay by 75 days the enforcement of the law that was put in place after U.S. officials warned that under ByteDance, there was a risk of Americans' data being misused.


Officials from Oracle and the White House held a meeting on Friday about a potential deal, and another meeting has been scheduled for next week, NPR reported.


Oracle was interested in a TikTok stake "in the tens of billions," but the rest of the deal is in flux, the NPR report cited the source as saying.


Trump has said he "would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture" in TikTok.


NPR cited another source as saying that appeasing Congress is seen as a key hurdle by the White House.


Free speech advocates have opposed TikTok's ban under a law passed by the U.S. Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden.


The company has said U.S. officials have misstated its ties to China, arguing its content recommendation engine and user data are stored in the United States on cloud servers operated by Oracle while content moderation decisions that affect American users are also made in the U.S.

## Rubio threatens bounties on Taliban leaders over detained Americans

date: 2025-01-26, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Saturday threatened bounties on the heads of Afghanistan's Taliban leaders, sharply escalating the tone as he said more Americans may be detained in the country than previously thought.


The threat comes days after the Afghan Taliban government and the United States swapped prisoners in one of the final acts of former U.S. President Joe Biden.


The new top U.S. diplomat issued the harsh warning via social media, in a rhetorical style strikingly similar to his boss, President Donald Trump.


"Just hearing the Taliban is holding more American hostages than has been reported," Rubio wrote on X.


"If this is true, we will have to immediately place a VERY BIG bounty on their top leaders, maybe even bigger than the one we had on bin Laden," he said, referring to the al-Qaida leader killed by U.S. forces in 2011.


Rubio did not describe who the other Americans may be, but there have long been accounts of missing Americans whose cases were not formally taken up by the U.S. government as wrongful detentions.


In the deal with the Biden administration, the Taliban freed the best-known American detained in Afghanistan, Ryan Corbett, who had been living with his family in the country and was seized in August 2022.


Also freed was William McKenty, an American about whom little information has been released.


The United States in turn freed Khan Mohammed, who was serving a life sentence in a California prison.


Mohammed was convicted of trafficking heroin and opium into the United States and was accused of seeking rockets to kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan.


The United States offered a bounty of $25 million for information leading to the capture or killing of Osama bin Laden shortly after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, with Congress later authorizing the secretary of state to offer up to $50 million.


No one is believed to have collected the bounty for bin Laden, who was killed in a U.S. raid in Pakistan.


Harder line on Taliban?


Trump is known for brandishing threats in his speeches and on social media. But he is also a critic of U.S. military interventions overseas and in his second inaugural address Monday said he aspired to be a "peacemaker."


In his first term, the Trump administration broke a then-taboo and negotiated directly with the Taliban -- with Trump even proposing a summit with the then-insurgents at the Camp David presidential retreat -- as he brokered a deal to pull U.S. troops and end America's longest war.


Biden carried out the agreement, with the Western-backed government swiftly collapsing and the Taliban retaking power in August 2021 just after U.S. troops left.


The scenes of chaos in Kabul brought strong criticism of Biden, especially when 13 American troops and scores of Afghans died in a suicide bombing at the city's airport.


The Biden administration had low-level contacts with Taliban government representatives but made little headway.


Some members of Trump's Republican Party criticized even the limited U.S. engagements with the Taliban government and especially the humanitarian assistance authorized by the Biden administration, which insisted the money was for urgent needs in the impoverished country and never routed through the Taliban.


Rubio on Friday froze nearly all U.S. aid around the world.


No country has officially recognized the Taliban government, which has imposed severe restrictions on women and girls under its ultra-conservative interpretation of Islam.


The International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor on Thursday said he was seeking arrest warrants for senior Taliban leaders over the persecution of women.

## Rain in southern California creates mudflows but helps firefighters

date: 2025-01-26, from: VOA News USA

LOS ANGELES — More rain fell Monday on parts of southern California after causing mudflows over the weekend, helping firefighters but boosting the risk of toxic ash runoff in areas scorched by Los Angeles-area wildfires.


Flood watches were in effect for burn areas from recent fires that broke out around the Pacific Palisades neighborhood in Los Angeles, Altadena and Castaic Lake, said Joe Sirard, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Oxnard.


“All these fresh burns are very susceptible to rapid runoff,” Sirard said, warning of even small amounts of rain in a few minutes' time. “What that means is we have a fairly high danger of mud and debris flows once we get above those thresholds.”


Los Angeles International Airport reported a little under 2.5 centimeters of rain in a 24-hour period ending at 3 a.m. Monday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported. Surrounding areas reported lesser amounts.


School was closed Monday for the four Malibu schools in the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District “due to dangerous road conditions and challenges with access to our schools,” school officials posted online.


A portion of the Pacific Coast Highway in Los Angeles County was closed as of Sunday afternoon due to mudflows in Topanga Canyon, the California Department of Transportation said. Heavy snow fell in the mountains in San Bernardino and Riverside counties.


One benefit that could come from the rain: It may help firefighters who are reining in multiple wildfires after weeks of windy and dry weather.


Los Angeles County crews spent much of last week removing vegetation, shoring up slopes and reinforcing roads in devastated areas of the Palisades and Eaton fires, which reduced entire neighborhoods to rubble and ash after breaking out during powerful winds on Jan. 7.


The Palisades Fire, the largest of the blazes that destroyed thousands of homes and killed at least 11 people, reached 90% containment Sunday. The Eaton Fire, which broke out near Altadena and has killed at least 16 people, was 98% contained.


The Hughes Fire, which ignited last week north of Los Angeles and caused evacuation orders or warnings for more than 50,000 people, was 95% contained as of Sunday evening.


In San Diego County, firefighters made progress to contain the smaller Border 2 Fire as it burned through a remote area of the Otay Mountain Wilderness near the U.S.-Mexico border.


Most of the region was forecast to get about an inch of precipitation over several days, but the weather service warned of a risk of localized cloudbursts causing mud and debris to flow down hills.


“So the problem would be if one of those showers happens to park itself over a burn area,” weather service meteorologist Carol Smith said on social media. “That could be enough to create debris flows.”


Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass issued an executive order last week to expedite cleanup efforts and mitigate the environmental impacts of fire-related pollutants. LA County supervisors also approved an emergency motion to install flood-control infrastructure and expedite and remove sediment in fire-impacted areas.


Fire crews filled sandbags for communities, while county workers installed barriers and cleared drainage pipes and basins.


Officials cautioned that ash in recent burn zones was a toxic mix of incinerated cars, electronics, batteries, building materials, paints, furniture and other household items. It contains pesticides, asbestos, plastics and lead. Residents were urged to wear protective gear while cleaning up.


Concerns about post-fire debris flows have been especially high since 2018, when the town of Montecito, up the coast from Los Angeles, was ravaged by mudslides after a downpour hit mountain slopes burned bare by a huge blaze. Hundreds of homes were damaged and 23 people died.


The rain snapped a near-record streak of dry weather for southern California. Most of southern California is currently in “extreme drought” or “severe drought,” according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.

## CIA: COVID likely originated in a lab, but agency has ‘low confidence’ in report

date: 2025-01-26, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON  — The CIA now believes the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic most likely originated from a laboratory, according to an assessment released Saturday that points the finger at China even while acknowledging that the spy agency has "low confidence" in its own conclusion.


The finding is not the result of any new intelligence, and the report was completed at the behest of the Biden administration and former CIA Director William Burns. It was declassified and released Saturday on the orders of President Donald Trump's pick to lead the agency, John Ratcliffe, who was sworn in Thursday as director.


The nuanced finding suggests the agency believes the totality of evidence makes a lab origin more likely than a natural origin. But the agency's assessment assigns a low degree of confidence to this conclusion, suggesting the evidence is deficient, inconclusive or contradictory.


Earlier reports on the origins of COVID-19 have split over whether the coronavirus emerged from a Chinese lab, potentially by mistake, or whether it arose naturally. The new assessment is not likely to settle the debate. In fact, intelligence officials say it may never be resolved, due to a lack of cooperation from Chinese authorities.


The CIA "continues to assess that both research-related and natural origin scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic remain plausible," the agency wrote in a statement about its new assessment.


Instead of new evidence, the conclusion was based on fresh analyses of intelligence about the spread of the virus, its scientific properties and the work and conditions of China's virology labs.


Lawmakers have pressured America's spy agencies for more information about the origins of the virus, which led to lockdowns, economic upheaval and millions of deaths. It's a question with significant domestic and geopolitical implications as the world continues to grapple with the pandemic's legacy.


Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Saturday he was "pleased the CIA concluded in the final days of the Biden administration that the lab-leak theory is the most plausible explanation," and he commended Ratcliffe for declassifying the assessment.


"Now, the most important thing is to make China pay for unleashing a plague on the world," Cotton said in a statement.


China's embassy in Washington did not immediately return messages seeking comment. Chinese authorities have in the past dismissed speculation about COVID's origins as unhelpful and motivated by politics.


While the origin of the virus remains unknown, scientists think the most likely hypothesis is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses, before infecting another species, probably racoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats. In turn, the infection spread to humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019.


Some official investigations, however, have raised the question of whether the virus escaped from a lab in Wuhan. Two years ago, a report by the Energy Department concluded a lab leak was the most likely origin, though that report also expressed low confidence in the finding.


The same year then-FBI Director Christopher Wray said his agency believed the virus "most likely" spread after escaping from a lab.


Ratcliffe, who served as director of national intelligence during Trump's first term, has said he favors the lab leak scenario, too.


"The lab leak is the only theory supported by science, intelligence, and common sense," Ratcliffe said in 2023.


The CIA said it will continue to evaluate any new information that could change its assessment.

## Haitian leader: Trump administration's deportation plans will be 'catastrophic'

date: 2025-01-26, from: VOA News USA

ROME — The president of Haiti's transitional presidential council said the Trump administration's decisions to freeze aid programs, deport migrants and block refugees will be "catastrophic" for Haiti.


Leslie Voltaire made the comment in an interview with The Associated Press in Rome on Saturday following a meeting with Pope Francis at the Vatican. He visited the pope to ask for help for Haiti.


"I'm knocking on the doors of people who love Haiti. The pope loves Haiti, and he is eager to help," Haiti's interim president said.


The pontiff and Voltaire discussed the dire situation in Haiti where gangs have killed civilians and operate across the Caribbean nation with impunity. Half of Haiti's 11.4 million people are already hungry, according to Voltaire, and losing humanitarian assistance will make the situation dramatically worse.


"Trump said that Haiti is a 'shithole,' so I don't think he will care about Haiti," Voltaire said, noting that thousands of people are already being repatriated from the Dominican Republic every week and gangs are terrorizing the populace. With the new U.S. policies, "the situation will be catastrophic."


During his first administration, President Donald Trump used blunt language to question why the U.S. would accept immigrants from Haiti and other countries in Africa. At the time, the White House did not deny his remark but issued a statement saying Trump supports immigration policies that welcome "those who can contribute to our society."


Voltaire said there are roughly 1.5 million Haitians in the United States and roughly 150,000 who were accepted under a program called the "Temporary Protection System."


"Trump says that he will expel all of them," Voltaire said, adding that Haiti, which is already struggling with hunger and internally displaced people, cannot handle the influx.


In a report released this month, the U.N. migration agency said internal displacement within Haiti has tripled over the last year and now surpasses 1 million people. The situation has been largely caused by gang violence in the Caribbean country. The new figure provided by the International Organization for Migration represents a record for Haiti.


IOM said that "relentless gang violence" in Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince has fueled a near-doubling of displacement in the city and a collapse of health care and other services and worsening food insecurity. About 200,000 people have been forcibly returned to Haiti over the last year mostly from the Dominican Republic.


Voltaire and his transitional government have been tasked with leading the country to general elections, an elusive goal but he is convinced they can make it happen by next November despite powerful gangs that rule 85% of the capital and are gaining ground in surrounding areas.


Nevertheless, Voltaire is positive that — if Haiti's multinational police force is boosted with several thousand additional officers — they can go ahead with elections this year.


Kenya is leading the multinational police force with a total deployment of more than 600, below the 1,000 officers the country's president pledged. An additional 150 Guatemalans and an advance team of eight Salvadorean troops have also arrived, but the force remains far below its anticipated strength of 2,500 officers. Voltaire said Benin has pledged an additional 2,000 soldiers.


"We have to do a referendum on a new constitution and also the election at the end of November. I say that we can do the elections because we have like eight departments, like 80% of the country. We can do the election."


The power of gangs in Haiti has grown since the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. Some gangs have even indicated they want to be part of the political process. Voltaire excluded that possibility, "I don't think they should be around the table."


More than 5,600 people were reported killed across Haiti last year, according to the United Nations. The number of killings increased by more than 20% compared with all of 2023, according to the U.N. Human Rights Office.
