## Steves: A crossroads of civilizations in Istanbul

date: 2025-05-04, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold

Scruffy kids sold cherry juice, and old men would grab huge cucumbers from wheeled carts, then peel, quarter, and salt them, and sell them for pennies. While the Old World magic in many parts of the city has been plowed under by modern affluence, today&#8217;s Istanbul is every bit as rich and rewarding as it was back then.</p>
