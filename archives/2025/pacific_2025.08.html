<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON &amp;#8212; President Donald Trump made a triumphant return to the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday, gleefully recounting his acts of retribution against the Biden administration to a crowd of loyal supporters that included people he had pardoned for their roles in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;

Watch: What happens beneath the surface doesn’t always stay beneath the
surface</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Kilauea has been erupting episodically for the past two months in Halema&amp;#8216;uma&amp;#8216;u, nested within the south end of Kaluapele, the summit caldera. Captivating lava fountains burst from the vent(s) during each eruption episode. Fascinating as those episodes are, scientists at the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory are equally as interested in what&amp;#8217;s happening beneath the surface between episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;On my last visit to Toledo, it seemed holier than ever: Dark El Greco clouds threatened overhead, stark against bright, clear horizons. Hail pelted the masses of people clogging the streets as they awaited the Good Friday procession.&lt;/p&gt;
