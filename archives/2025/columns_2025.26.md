**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-07-02, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/03/12/hamstercage.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Software internally is mostly pipes connected to other pipes, each adding a specific quality to whatever passes through it. If you have nice standards for what you send through the pipes, you can do more of what you imagine. This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality_(programming)">orthogonality</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring">Factoring</a> is when you notice a repeating pattern, give it a name, and a set of things you can do to it, those would be names of pipes. I have to ask ChatGPT what it thinks about this, but I am also asking my human friends. BTW I expect this seems so natural because our minds probably work that way too, internally, below our conscious awareness.

## 2025-07-02 Cloudflare? No.

date: 2025-07-02, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-07-02-cloudflare-no">2025-07-02 Cloudflare? No.</h1>

<p><a class="account" href="https://social.tchncs.de/@babelcarp" title="@babelcarp@social.tchncs.de">@babelcarp</a> asked me about Cloudflare. I think their efforts to block bots and other forms of distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks are commendable and interesting. But at the same time, I don&rsquo;t want to use them.</p>

<p>Whatever tech they are using to identify bots is proprietary. Is it the list of user agents? The behaviour of certain IP numbers or networks? I mean, I try to do the same thing, right? But using their solution costs money and puts me at their mercy. This is problematic even if they give me their protection for free. If I can no longer defend myself, I&rsquo;ll be happy to accept their help. But until then, I&rsquo;m going to look for other ways.</p>

<p>As a society, handing over control over vast swaths of the web to a single US company is problematic, too. Sure, this gives them great power to find bots and analyse their behaviour across a gazillion websites. But when Cloudflare is down, a large part of the public Internet is down, too. If they censor a country, a company, or an individual, everybody using their service automatically partakes in the action.</p>

<p>Those problems remain even if Cloudflare decided to share their blocklists. Everybody would have an auto-update on short notice, like every 15min at least. And therefore, we&rsquo;d all accept their decisions. If the US president decides that Canada or Greenland or Ukraine or Iran or Palestine needs to be blocked, Cloudflare will have to comply. And without human oversight, everybody using their services will be an accomplice.</p>

<p>What I think would be best is more people experimenting and documenting approaches to the problem. We need to find solutions, collectively. <a href="https://anubis.techaro.lol/">Anubis</a> relies on proof-of-work and JavaScript. This is not ideal for the environment and it&rsquo;s not ideal for browsers without JavaScript. <a href="https://iocaine.madhouse-project.org/">Iocaine</a> uses various ways of identifying bots and feeds them auto-generated drivel in order to poison their data sources. <a href="https://zadzmo.org/code/nepenthes/">Nephentes</a> is a similar tarpit. These solutions are also not ideal for the environment. But process is exactly what we need: More people researching ways to keep the web free.</p>

<p>I wish Cloudflare would share their techniques of keeping the web free. But that, of course, is a bad idea under capitalism.</p>

<p>People using Cloudflare need to weigh the costs and benefits. The ease of use and the ubiquity is a boon. You will never walk alone. It might cost money and a little bit of independence, but it keeps the websites up, so the primary goal is achieved.</p>

<p>Luckily, I&rsquo;m not there, yet. I&rsquo;ve had a few days of downtime but my websites are also not very important. So I can keep on experimenting and documenting approaches to keeping the web free.</p>

## Wednesday, July 2, 2025

date: 2025-07-02, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

And if insurers aren&#39;t buying, hospitals close. Time has a good piece making clear that the socialized part of the U.S. health care system—Medicare and Medicaid—are socialist gravy on a vast B2B insurance business operating inside a captured regulatorium. Patient problems are products bought and sold. Also that it has more than four million views. [&#8230;]

## 2025-06-16 Ban autonomous systems

date: 2025-07-02, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-06-16-ban-autonomous-systems">2025-06-16 Ban autonomous systems</h1>

<p>More people have been working on blocking whole ranges of IP numbers, since that catches hosting providers that give bots access to the whole range they control. The bots switch IP numbers all the time so a filter based on IP numbers won&rsquo;t catch them. But if we can determine their autonomous system number (ASN), we can not only block an IP number range, we can block all the IP number rangers the ASN controls.</p>

<p>Now, since these hosting providers also host nice things like other fediverse instances, I don&rsquo;t want to block them forever. I want to block them for 10min, and if they continue after a few of these shorter blocks, I want to block them for a week. Hopefully, their clients have ended their Internet slurping and things are back to normal. This is how fail2ban works, but only for individual IP numbers.</p>

<p>I want code that bridges this gap.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Butlerian_Jihad">#Butlerian Jihad</a></p>

<h2 id="where-to-start">Where to start</h2>

<p><a href="github.com/WKnak/fail2ban-bloc">fail2ban-bloc</a> tries to guess (!) IP ranges and bans those using fail2ban. I need to investigate more.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still fascinated by <a href="https://anarc.at/blog/2025-05-30-asncounter/">asncounter</a>. It might even work without logfiles, using <code>tcpdump</code>! For now, it generates an interesting Top 10 list. What&rsquo;s interesting about it is that it doesn&rsquo;t require me to query an external service and leak IP numbers.</p>

<p>I used to have the following fish function, for example:</p>

<pre><code>function asn
    for ip in $argv
        dig +short (string split '.' $ip|tac -|string join '.').origin.asn.cymru.com. TXT
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>What I don&rsquo;t want to do is write another tool like <a href="/admin/network-lookup-lean">network-lookup-lean</a> which uses <code>asn.routeviews.org</code> for the same purposes, caches results, and so on. I want to get rid of this live lookup.</p>

<h2 id="working-with-asncounter">Working with <code>asncounter</code></h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s me looking at the last Apache log file, excluding my fedi instance:</p>

<pre><code>awk '!/^social/ {print $2}' /var/log/apache2/access.log | asncounter --no-prefixes

</code></pre>

<p>INIT7 is my Internet service provider at home and NINE is my hosting provider for the server. Better not ban those! 😅</p>

<p>So what is VNPT-AS-VN VNPT Corp doing? This could use better tool support!</p>

<pre><code>grep '2001:ee0:4f' /var/log/apache2/access.log | awk '{print $8}' | sort | uniq -c | head

</code></pre>

<p>OK, this is bots. Useless random URLs.</p>

<h2 id="ban-all-the-networks-managed-by-an-asn">Ban all the networks managed by an ASN</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to use <code>ipset</code> to use two lists, <code>banlist</code> and <code>banlist6</code>.
I use these two for <a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a>, too.</p>

<pre><code># Use hash:net because of the CIDR stuff
ipset create banlist hash:net
iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP
iptables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP

ipset create banlist6 hash:net family inet6
ip6tables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
ip6tables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
</code></pre>

<p>To ban all the IP ranges an ASN manages, I created the following little fish function using <code>ip.guide</code>:</p>

<pre><code>function asn-ban
    for asn in $argv
        for cidr in (curl -sL &quot;https://ip.guide/as$asn&quot; | jq --raw-output '.routes.v4[]')
            echo ipset add banlist $cidr
        end
        for cidr in (curl -sL &quot;https://ip.guide/as$asn&quot; | jq --raw-output '.routes.v6[]')
            echo ipset add banlist6 $cidr
        end
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s try it with the ASN 45899!</p>

<pre><code>asn-ban 45899 | sh
netfilter-persistent save
</code></pre>

<p>For more about <code>netfilter-persistent save</code> see the comments on <a href="2025-01-23-bots-devouring-the-web">2025-01-23 The bots are at it again</a>.</p>

<p>When I ran the <code>asn-ban</code> command above, I noticed that I got a single &ldquo;it&rsquo;s already added&rdquo; response.
Before adding the same numbers to my shell script, therefore:</p>

<pre><code>for cidr in (asn-ban 45899|awk '{print $4}'); if grep -q $cidr bin/admin/ban-cidr; echo $cidr; end; end
</code></pre>

<p>That told me I had to remove <code>14.187.96.0/20</code> from my script. Once this is done:</p>

<pre><code>echo (echo &quot;#&quot;; date --iso)  &gt;&gt; bin/admin/ban-cidr
asn-ban 45899 &gt;&gt; bin/admin/ban-cidr 
</code></pre>

<p>I really need to figure out how to manage this smartly. And I need to figure out a way to unban the whole list!</p>

<h2 id="integration-with-fail2ban">Integration with <code>fail2ban</code></h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with <code>fail2ban</code>. I need a jail! Every jail needs a filter!</p>

<p>In <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/alex.conf</code> (this is where I maintain all my jails) I added:</p>

<pre><code>[butlerian-jihad]
enabled = true
bantime = 1d
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this jail doesn&rsquo;t define log paths. I hope that works as intended.</p>

<p>I created a matching filter with no definition in <code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/butlerian-jihad.conf</code>:</p>

<pre><code># Author: Alex Schroeder &lt;alex@gnu.org&gt;
[Definition]
</code></pre>

<p>Reload it all, and check:</p>

<pre><code>fail2ban-client reload
OK
fail2ban-client status
Status
|- Number of jail:	6
`- Jail list:	alex-apache, alex-bots, butlerian-jihad, ngircd, recidive, sshd
</code></pre>

<p>Nice! So now I have a new jail.</p>

<h2 id="undo-the-banlist">Undo the banlist</h2>

<pre><code>asn-ban 45899 | sed 's/ipset add/ipset del/' | sh
</code></pre>

<p>I also manually edited my <a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a> file to remove the lines I added above. Let&rsquo;s have fail2ban handle this!</p>

<h2 id="switch-from-ipset-to-fail2ban-client">Switch from <code>ipset</code> to <code>fail2ban-client</code></h2>

<pre><code>function asn-ban
    for asn in $argv
        set --local cidr (curl -sL &quot;https://ip.guide/as$asn&quot; | jq --raw-output '.routes.v4[],.routes.v6[]')
        echo fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip $cidr
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Examine it:</p>

<pre><code>asn-ban 45899 | less
</code></pre>

<p>Run it:</p>

<pre><code>asn-ban 45899 | sh
3640
</code></pre>

<p>If you messed up, clear the jail:</p>

<pre><code>fail2ban-client reload --unban butlerian-jihad
</code></pre>

<p>Check the jail:</p>

<pre><code>fail2ban-client get butlerian-jihad banned
</code></pre>

<p>Count the entries in the jail:</p>

<pre><code>fail2ban-client get butlerian-jihad banned | sed 's/\'/&quot;/g' | jq length
3640
</code></pre>

<h2 id="what-do-we-have">What do we have?</h2>

<p>With <code>asncounter</code> we have a tool to quickly discover if an ASN is providing services to a bot.</p>

<p>With <code>asn-ban</code> we have a tool to quickly add all the IP networks the ASN is managing to a jail for <code>fail2ban</code>.</p>

<p>The jail which we called <code>butlerian-jihad</code> bans the IP networks for a day.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-left-to-do">What&rsquo;s left to do?</h2>

<p>I should check whether this actually works! Let&rsquo;s see whether the ban gets lifted after 24h. That&rsquo;s the main point of this exercise!</p>

<p><code>asn-ban</code> uses the <code>ip.guide</code> site for the data. This should be rewritten such that it uses the same data as <code>asncounter</code>.
I guess that would be <a href="https://github.com/hadiasghari/pyasn">pyasn</a>.
See below!</p>

<p>I need a cron job that runs every 10 minutes, takes the last ten minutes worth of Apache access log files, ignores the fedi subdomain, identifies all the ASNs, ignores my own ASNs and bans the rest.</p>

<h2 id="some-bans">Some bans</h2>

<p>Wow, some of the autonomous systems are big.
These are the ones I banned yesterday and today:</p>

<pre><code># AMAZON-02, US (18772!)
asn-ban 16509|sh
# VNPT-AS-VN VNPT Corp, VN (3640!)
asn-ban 45899 | sh
# TENCENT-NET-AP Shenzhen Tencent Computer Systems Company Limited, CN (2278!)

# FACEBOOK, US (541!)

</code></pre>

<h2 id="using-pyasn-data-files-from-the-command-line">Using <code>pyasn</code> data files from the command-line</h2>

<p>How to determine the name of an autonomous system number:</p>

<pre><code>jq --raw-output '.[&quot;32934&quot;]' .cache/pyasn/asnames.json
FACEBOOK, US
</code></pre>

<p>How to determine the networks for an ASN:</p>

<pre><code>zgrep '209366$' .cache/pyasn/ipasn_20250616.1200.dat.gz | awk '{print $1}'
85.208.96.0/24
85.208.97.0/24
85.208.99.0/24
185.170.167.0/24
185.191.171.0/24
</code></pre>

<p>How to determine the ASN of a CIDR:</p>

<pre><code>zgrep '^85\.208\.96\.0/24' .cache/pyasn/ipasn_20250616.1200.dat.gz | awk '{print $2}'
209366
</code></pre>

<h2 id="asn-networks-without-an-external-service">ASN networks without an external service</h2>

<p><a href="/admin/asn-networks">asn-networks</a> is a tiny script with a bunch of lines taken from <code>asncounter</code> to print the IP ranges managed by one or more autonomous systems.</p>

<pre><code>python3 asn-ban 209366
185.170.167.0/24
185.191.171.0/24
85.208.96.0/24
85.208.97.0/24
85.208.99.0/24
</code></pre>

<p>It uses the <code>pyasn</code> datafiles that a regular run of <code>asncounter</code> has downloaded.
That is to say, <code>asn-networks</code> does not download or refresh these files.
I&rsquo;m assuming that you have run <code>asncounter</code> just moments earlier.</p>

<p>Given this script, we can now call <code>fail2ban-client</code> as follows (I use fish) to ban all the networks:</p>

<pre><code>fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip (asn-networks 209366)
5
</code></pre>

<p>Unbanning works the same way:</p>

<pre><code>fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad unbanip (asn-networks 209366)
5
</code></pre>

<p>Remember that <code>fail2ban-client</code> prints the number of IP numbers or ranges added or removed.</p>

<h2 id="identifying-suspicious-asn">Identifying suspicious ASN</h2>

<p>What is suspicious activity? How about this: In a 2h window, no ASN should send more than 1000 requests? So we need a script that filters the log files and prints a 2h window, skipping the lines we want to ignore: <a href="/admin/2h-access-log">2h-access-log</a>. Then pass the IP numbers to <code>asncounter</code>, throw away all the things we don&rsquo;t care about and just print the appropriate lines:</p>

<pre><code>bin/2h-access-log !^social \
| awk '{print $2}' \
| bin/asncounter --no-prefixes 2&gt;/dev/null \
| awk '/^[0-9]/ &amp;&amp; $1&gt;1000  { print }'
3062	31.93	24940	HETZNER-AS, DE
1642	17.12	16276	OVH, FR
</code></pre>

<p>So do I dare ban those numbers?? I&rsquo;m not sure!
I should figure out a way to find those 3062 requests made by services hosted on Hetzner.</p>

<p><a href="/admin/asn-access-log">asn-access-log</a> does just that. You pass it an ASN, it determines all the networks it manages and then it filters standard input, assuming that it consists of Apache access log lines (what counts is that the second field is an IP number).</p>

<pre><code>bin/2h-access-log !^social | bin/asn-access-log 24940
</code></pre>

<p>I see a lot of RSS services (NewsBlur, fiperbot, MyNewspaper Agent, FreshRSS), git, some bot (from the 159.69.0.0/16 range, for example), and on and on. Ugh. It&rsquo;s not easy to know what to do!</p>

<p>I think the best answer would be to lower the stakes but also ban for shorter amounts of time and let <code>fail2ban</code> handle the rest. The only thing I need to consider is whether I find the current amount of resources spent OK. Do I? Let&rsquo;s look at the latest numbers.</p>

<p>This here shows that fedi traffic is 60% Hetzner and OVH. This makes it hard for me to block these autonomous systems.</p>

<p>The autonomous systems that show up in the second list but not in the first list are my prime candidates, like COMCAST and CHINAMOBILE-CN.</p>

<p>So how about going after the autonomous systems on the second list that produce more than 1000 hits in a 2h period.</p>

<p>Something like this? I&rsquo;m going to but this into <code>/etc/cron.daily/butlerian-jihad</code></p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
bin/2h-access-log !^social !178.209.50.237 \
| awk '{print $2}' \
| bin/asncounter --no-prefixes 2&gt;/dev/null \
| awk '/^[0-9]/ &amp;&amp; $1&gt;1000 { print $3 }' \
| ifne xargs bin/asn-networks \
| ifne xargs echo fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip
</code></pre>

<p>I use <code>ifne</code> to prevent the execution of the command if there is no input.
Thanks, <a class="account" href="https://tilde.zone/@acdw" title="@acdw@tilde.zone">@acdw</a>!</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p><code>/etc/cron.daily/butlerian-jihad</code> runs every hour and checks if there have been any abusive autonomous systems in the last two hours. If so, they are banned. Note how I&rsquo;ve added my home IPv4 and IPv6 because I use my site a lot. 😅</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
bin/2h-access-log !^social !178.209.50.237 !MY-HOME-IPV4 !MY-HOME-IPV6 \
| awk '{print $2}' \
| bin/asncounter --no-prefixes 2&gt;/dev/null \
| awk '/^[0-9]/ &amp;&amp; $1&gt;1000 { print $3 }' \
| ifne xargs bin/asn-networks \
| ifne xargs fail2ban-client set butlerian-jihad banip \
&gt; /dev/null
</code></pre>

<p>This drops the output (the number of new bans) because otherwise the cron job mails that number to me.</p>

<p><a href="/admin/2h-access-log">2h-access-log</a> prints the last two hours worth of log lines from <code>/var/log/apache2/access.log</code> (and <code>access.log.1</code> if necessary).</p>

<p>The <code>!^social</code> argument ensures that connecting to my fedi server doesn&rsquo;t trigger the ban hammer.</p>

<p>The <code>!178.209.50.237</code> argument ensures that I don&rsquo;t ban the server itself as it monitors stuff and as I test things on the server. I also had to add my home IP numbers!</p>

<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/anarcat/asncounter/">asncounter</a> finds the autonomous system numbers for all the IP numbers in the web server log file and prints a report.</p>

<p><a href="/admin/asn-networks">asn-networks</a> then turns the selected autonomous system numbers and returns the IP ranges they manage.</p>

<p>These are then banned by <code>fail2ban-client</code> using the <code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail.</p>

<p>The <code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail is mentioned in enabled via a config file in <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/</code>. In my case, the file is called <code>alex.conf</code> and for this jail, it says:</p>

<pre><code>[butlerian-jihad]
enabled = true
bantime = 1h
</code></pre>

<p>The jail also needs a filter definition even though no filtering happens as no logfile is checked.
My <code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/butlerian-jihad.conf</code> contains just this:</p>

<pre><code># Author: Alex Schroeder &lt;alex@gnu.org&gt;
[Definition]
</code></pre>

<p>What this means is that every hour, an autonomous system unit can get banned for generating more than 500 hits in 2h.
If they are banned, they are banned for 1h.
If they are banned for activity in the last hour leading up to the ban (more than 500 hits in 1h), the script will find the same log entries and ban them &ldquo;again&rdquo;. This results in no changes in the jail, since all the networks are already in the <code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail.</p>

<p>The bans themselves are reported in <code>/etc/log/fail2ban.log</code>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also enabled the <code>recidive</code> jail. That is, in the same file where I defined my <code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail, I have:</p>

<pre><code>[recidive]
enabled = true
</code></pre>

<p>The defaults are in <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[recidive]

logpath  = /var/log/fail2ban.log
banaction = %(banaction_allports)s
bantime  = 1w
findtime = 1d
</code></pre>

<p>So if some network is banned for more than five times in a day, it is banned for a week.
I say five times because <code>maxretry</code> is set to 5 in <code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf</code>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s assume a scraper is started from some network managed by an autonomous system. It starts using IP numbers from all its ranges. It sends 400 requests per hour, more than a human could read and more than a feed reader should need, etc.</p>

<ul>
<li>after the first hour, nothing happens, as 400 is less than the 500 needed to trigger the system</li>
<li>after the second hour, the ASN is banned because the sum total for the last two hours is 800</li>
<li>after the third hour, the ASN is unbanned and not banned again because it only made 400 requests in the second hour</li>
<li>after the fourth hour, the ASN is banned again</li>
<li>after the fifth hour, the ASN is unbanned</li>
<li>after the sixth hour, the ASN is banned for the third time</li>
<li>after the seventh hour, the ASN is unbanned</li>
<li>after the eighth hour, the ASN is banned for the fourth time</li>
<li>after the ninth hour, the ASN is unbanned</li>
<li>after the tenth hour, the ASN is banned for the fifth time</li>
<li>after the eleventh hour, the ASN is unbanned</li>
<li>after the twelfth hour, the ASN is banned for the sixth time, the <code>recidive</code> filter kicks in and the networks belonging to the ASN are banned for a week</li>
</ul>

<p>This escalation takes twelve hours. The ASN was already banned for half this time.</p>

<p>Assuming this repeats every week, it means that the pattern repeats every 7½ weeks and the abusive ASN still gets service on 6h out of 180h or 3% of the time. For my taste, that is still way too nice.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see how this goes for a while.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m already looking forward to dropping my <code>banlist</code> and <code>banlist6</code> sets I created for <a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a>.</p>

<h2 id="aftermath-cleaning-up-ban-cidr">Aftermath: cleaning up <code>ban-cidr</code></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to partake in unsupervised banning with no feedback, no due process, just automatic ban-hammers, take a look at this script full of firewall commands.&rdquo; &ndash; <a href="2025-01-23-bots-devouring-the-web">2025-01-23 The bots are at it again</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Back when I first encountered the distributed AI bot attacks, I wrote <a href="2024-09-15-emacs-china">2024-09-18 Emacs Wiki and China</a> and began working on <code>ban-cidr</code>. In later posts, I just automated the work of getting from an IP number to a network range and adding that to the script. Now that I hopefully have an automatic solution where I only need to fine-tune the time-windows and the limits, it&rsquo;s time to expire all those bans. There are currently over 40,000 of these banned networks.</p>

<pre><code>ipset list banlist | tail -n +9 | wc -l
46920
ipset list banlist6 | tail -n +9 | wc -l
9
</code></pre>

<p>So slowly, over time, I&rsquo;m planning to remove these.</p>

<pre><code>for ip in (ipset list banlist | tail -n +9 | head -n 1000); ipset del banlist $ip; end
netfilter-persistent save
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see how it goes! 😂</p>

<p>(Done: all of these blocks are now removed.)</p>

<h2 id="petty-banning">Petty banning</h2>

<p>Ugh. They need to go.</p>

<p>First, create the two lists. At this level we need two different lists for IPv4 and IPv6.</p>

<pre><code>ipset create banlist hash:net
iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP
iptables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP

ipset create banlist6 hash:net family inet6
ip6tables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
ip6tables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist6 src -j DROP
</code></pre>

<p>Then define a new version of <code>asn-ban</code>:</p>

<pre><code>function asn-ban
    set --local data (asn-networks --json $argv)
    for asn in $argv
        for ip in (echo $data | jq --raw-output &quot;.[\&quot;$asn\&quot;].v4[]&quot;)
            echo ipset add banlist $ip
        end
        for ip in (echo $data | jq --raw-output &quot;.[\&quot;$asn\&quot;].v6[]&quot;)
            echo ipset add banlist6 $ip
        end
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This uses the <code>--json</code> option for <a href="/admin/asn-networks">asn-networks</a> so that we only need to call it once and yet we get two lists: one for <code>banlist</code> and one for <code>banlist6</code>.</p>

<p>To ban the offending ASN:</p>

<pre><code>asn-ban 55836|sh
</code></pre>

<p>Before I do that, however, I want to finish clearing the existing lists.</p>

<p>The reason I call this petty banning is because I&rsquo;m starting to ban autonomous systems even though their bots are &ldquo;well behaved&rdquo; in as much as they don&rsquo;t exceed the thresholds I defined. And yet they seem to be part of that great parade to honour the CO₂ god, the computation of useless shit.</p>

<p><strong>2025-06-20</strong>. I&rsquo;m thinking about alternatives but I think that&rsquo;s not worth it.
For example: Perhaps it&rsquo;s important to look at relative distribution?</p>

<pre><code>site-log transjovian | log-ip | asncounter --no-prefixes --top 3 2&gt;/dev/null
count	percent	ASN	AS
7	36.84	132203	TENCENT-NET-AP-CN Tencent Building, Kejizhongyi Avenue, CN
3	15.79	216071	VDSINA, AE
3	15.79	396982	GOOGLE-CLOUD-PLATFORM, US
total: 19
</code></pre>

<p>At first I thought, more than a third of all requests for Tencent? I must block them.
But then I saw that it was just 7 requests in 2h. Not worth it.</p>

<p>Here I saw that there were more requests, and an 80% share!</p>

<pre><code>site-log orientalisch | log-ip | asncounter --no-prefixes --top 3 2&gt;/dev/null
count	percent	ASN	AS
172	81.52	45102	ALIBABA-CN-NET Alibaba US Technology Co., Ltd., CN
20	9.48	396982	GOOGLE-CLOUD-PLATFORM, US
10	4.74	132203	TENCENT-NET-AP-CN Tencent Building, Kejizhongyi Avenue, CN
total: 211
</code></pre>

<p>But when you look at it, Alibaba is just fetching <code>robots.txt</code> all the time.
I don&rsquo;t know who runs this bot. It&rsquo;s clearly a waste of CO₂. And yet… not worth it.</p>

<pre><code>site-log orientalisch | asn-access-log 45102 | log-request | rank-lines
    172 /robots.txt
</code></pre>

<p>So, I don&rsquo;t know. And if I don&rsquo;t care about the relative share of requests, then I also don&rsquo;t have to count them per site.</p>

<p>I already wrote a little thing to give me a regular expression for every site I host!
But now I&rsquo;m not going to use it. I leave it here for you, dear reader. 😄</p>

<pre><code>awk '/^MDomain/ {split($0, sites)
  result = sites[2]
  for (i = 3; i &lt;= length(sites); i++)
    result = result &quot;|&quot; sites[i]
  print result
}' /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/*.conf
</code></pre>

<p>On the positive side, the current system seems to be working:</p>

<pre><code>awk '/butlerian-jihad/ { print $7, $8 }' /var/log/fail2ban.log | rank-lines
     10 Ban 45.254.32.0/22
     10 Ban 45.124.92.0/22
     10 Ban 43.239.220.0/23

     10 Ban 203.160.132.0/22
</code></pre>

<p>A bunch of networks were banned 10 times! Who do the Top 100 networks belong to?
It&rsquo;s a Vietnamese autonomous system.</p>

<pre><code>awk '/butlerian-jihad/ { print $7, $8 }' /var/log/fail2ban.log \

<p>So maybe that&rsquo;s the answer: More than 50 requests resulting in a <code>/nobots</code> response qualify the ASN for the <code>butlerian-jihad</code> jail!</p>

<p>I have migrated <code>/etc/cron.hourly/butlerian-jihad</code> to <code>/etc/cron.d/butlerian-jigad</code> and it now has two jobs to run.</p>

## Ubuntu Disables Spectre/Meltdown Protections

date: 2025-07-02, updated: 2025-07-01, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>A whole class of speculative execution attacks against CPUs <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/01/spectre_and_mel_1.html">were published</a> in 2018. They seemed pretty catastrophic at the time. But the fixes were as well. Speculative execution was a way to speed up CPUs, and removing those enhancements resulted in significant performance drops.</p>
<p>Now, people are rethinking the trade-off. Ubuntu <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/intel-compute-runtime/+bug/2110131">has disabled</a> some protections, resulting in  20% performance boost.</p>

</blockquote>
This was apropos of Donald Trump's approach to tariffs and Ukraine, but below the fold I apply the criterion to Elon Musk basing Tesla's future on its robotaxi service.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span>
<br />
Jonathan V. Last's <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/elon-musk-self-driving-fsd-tesla-tony-stark-michael-scott"><i>A Song of “Full Self-Driving”: Elon Isn’t Tony Stark. He’s Michael Scott.</i></a> shows that Musk's bullshitting started almost a decade ago:<br />
<blockquote>
  For years, Elon Musk has been promising that Teslas will operate completely autonomously in “Full Self Driving” (FSD) mode. And when I say years, I mean <a href="https://motherfrunker.ca/fsd/">years</a>:<br />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://fortune.com/2015/12/21/elon-musk-interview/">December 2015</a>: “We’re going to end up with complete autonomy, and I think we will have complete autonomy in approximately two years.”</li>
<li><a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/686279251293777920">January 2016</a>: “In ~2 years, summon should work anywhere connected by land &amp; not blocked by borders, eg you’re in LA and the car is in NY.”</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/wsixsRI-Sz4?si=Mylq3wbbVuENBWxL&amp;t=4710">June 2016</a>: “I really would consider autonomous driving to be basically a solved problem. . . . I think we’re basically less than two years away from complete autonomy, complete—safer than a human. However regulators will take at least another year.”</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/autos/driverless-tesla-will-travel-l-nyc-2017-says-musk-n670206">October 2016</a>: By the end of 2017 Tesla will demonstrate a fully autonomous drive from “a home in L.A., to Times Square . . . without the need for a single touch, including the charging.”</li>
<li><a href="https://electrek.co/2018/03/11/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-self-driving-next-year/">March 2018</a>: “I think probably by end of next year [end of 2019] self-driving will encompass essentially all modes of driving”</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOy3MTZ9Dyg">February 2019</a>: “I think we will be feature complete—full self-driving—this year. Meaning the car will be able to find you in a parking lot, pick you up, take you all the way to your destination without an intervention, this year."</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<a href="https://motherfrunker.ca/fsd/">@motherfrunker"</a> tracks this BS, and the most recent entry is:<br />
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwq_PhtvLwo">January 2022</a>: I will be shocked if we don't achieve FSD safer than a human this year</li>
</ul>
But finally, on June 22<sup>nd</sup>, Tesla's robotaxi revolution arrived. Never one to miss an opportunity to <a href="https://gizmodo.com/elon-musks-trillion-dollar-robotaxi-gamble-is-here-2000618771">pump the stock with bullshit</a>, Musk:<br />
<blockquote>
envisions a future fleet, including a new “Cybercab” and “Robovan” with no steering wheels or pedals, that could boost Tesla’s market value by an astonishing $5 trillion to $10 trillion. On June 20, Tesla was worth $1.04 trillion
</blockquote>
As usual, there are plenty of cult members <a href="https://gizmodo.com/elon-musks-trillion-dollar-robotaxi-gamble-is-here-2000618771">lapping up the BS</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
“My view is the golden age of autonomous vehicles starting on Sunday in Austin for Tesla,” said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. “I believe it’s a trillion dollar valuation opportunity for Tesla.”
</blockquote>
Dan Ives obviously only sipped 10-20% of Musk's CoolAid. Others <a href="https://gizmodo.com/elon-musks-trillion-dollar-robotaxi-gamble-is-here-2000618771">drank deeper</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Investor Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest predicts robotaxis could account for 90% of Tesla’s profits by 2029. If they are right, this weekend’s launch was existential.
</blockquote>
Tesla's net income from the trailing 12 months is <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/financials/">around $6.1B</a> and falling. Assuming, optimistically, that  they can continue to sell cars at the current rate, Cathie Woods is assuming that robotaxi <i>profits</i> would be around $60B. Tesla's net margin is around 6%, so this implies revenue of almost $1T in 2029. Tesla charges $4.20/ride (ha! ha!), so this implies that they are delivering 231B rides/year, or around 23,000 times the rate of the entire robotaxi industry currently. Woods is projecting that in four year's time Tesla's robotaxi business will have almost as much revenue as Amazon ($638B), Microsoft ($245B) and Nvidia ($130B) <i>combined</i>.<br />
<br />
Liam Denning's analysis in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-06-27/tesla-s-800-billion-robotaxi-dream-is-finally-facing-reality"><i>Tesla’s $800 Billion Robotaxi Dream Is Finally Facing Reality</i></a> is only somewhat less optimistic:<br />
<blockquote>
"On generous assumptions, Tesla’s core EV business, generating 75% of gross profit but with falling sales, might be worth roughly $50 per share, only 15% of the current price. Much of the remainder relates to expectations around self driving. RBC Capital, for example, ascribes 59% of its price target, or $181 per share, to robotaxis and a further $53 to monetizing Full Self Driving technology. Combined, that is a cool $815 billion based on double-digit multiples ascribed to modeled revenue — not earnings — 10 to 15 years from now because, after all, it relates to businesses that barely make money today."
</blockquote>
This all seems a tad optimistic, given the current state of Tesla's and the competition's robotaxi offerings.  Brad Templeton says "<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2025/06/22/tesla-misses-robotaxi-launch-date-goes-with-safety-drivers/">pay no attention to the person in the passenger seat</a>":<br />
<blockquote>
Tesla’s much-anticipated June 22 “no one in the vehicle” “unsupervised” Robotaxi launch in Austin is not ready. Instead, Tesla is operating a limited service with Tesla employees on board the vehicle to maintain safety.<br />
...<br />
Having an employee who can intervene on board, commonly called a safety driver, is the approach that every robocar company has used for testing, including testing of passenger operations. Most companies spend many years (Waymo spent a decade) testing with safety drivers, and once they are ready to take passengers, there are typically some number of years testing in that mode, though the path to removing the safety driver depends primarily on evaluation of the safety case for the vehicle, and less on the presence of passengers.<br />
<br />
In addition to Musk’s statements about the vehicle being unsupervised, with nobody inside, in general the removal of the safety driver is the biggest milestone in development of a true robotaxi, not an incremental step that can be ignored. As such, Tesla has yet to meet its goals.<br />
</blockquote>
Seven-and-a-half years after Musk's deadline for "complete autonomy" the best Tesla can do is a small robotaxi service for invited guests in a geofenced area of Austin with a safety driver in daylight. Waymo has <a href="tesla_robotaxi_austin">100 robotaxis in service in Austin</a>. Three months ago <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2025/03/07/robotaxis-mostly-waymo-are-giving-13-million-ridesmonth--why/">Brad Templeton reported that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Waymo, the self-driving unit of Alphabet, announced recently that they are now providing 200,000 self-driving taxi rides every week with no safety driver in the car, only passengers.<br />
...<br />
In China, though, several companies are giving rides with no safety driver. The dominant player is Baidu Apollo, which reports they did 1.1 million rides last quarter, which is 84,000 per week, and they now are all no-safety-driver. Pony.AI claims 26,000 per week, but it is not clear if all are with no safety driver. AutoX does not report numbers, but says it has 1,000 cars in operation. WeRide also does not report numbers.
</blockquote>
It turns out that the safety driver is necessary. Craig Trudell and Kara Carlson's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-23/tesla-robotaxi-videos-show-speeding-driving-into-wrong-lane"><i>Tesla Robotaxi Incidents Draw Scrutiny From US Safety Agency</i></a> reports on the first day of the robotaxi revolution:<br />
<blockquote>
US auto safety regulators are looking into incidents where Tesla Inc.’s self-driving robotaxis appeared to violate traffic laws during the company’s first day offering paid rides in Austin.<br />
...<br />
In one video taken by investor Rob Maurer, who used to host a Tesla podcast, a Model Y he’s riding in enters an Austin intersection in a left-turn-only lane. The Tesla hesitates to make the turn, swerves right and proceeds into an unoccupied lane meant for traffic moving in the opposite direction.<br />
<br />
A honking horn can be heard as the Tesla re-enters the correct lane over a double-yellow line, which drivers aren’t supposed to cross.<br />
<br />
In two other posts on X, initial riders in driverless Model Ys shared footage of Teslas speeding. A vehicle carrying Sawyer Merritt, a Tesla investor, reached 35 miles per hour shortly after passing a 30 miles per hour speed limit sign, a video he posted shows.
</blockquote>
Tesla's level of incompetence is not a surprise. Tesla added "(Supervised)" to FSD in the US. They aren't allowed to call the technology <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/03/25/tesla-drops-fsd-from-name-of-its-driver-assist-tech-in-china/">"Full Self-Driving" in China</a>. They recently rolled out <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/03/25/tesla-drops-fsd-from-name-of-its-driver-assist-tech-in-china/">"Intelligent Assisted Driving" in China</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
But immediately after that rollout, Tesla drivers started <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/02/27/tesla-drivers-are-racking-up-fines-using-fsd-in-china/">racking up fines</a> for violating the law. Many roads in China are watched by CCTV cameras, and fines are automatically handed out to drivers to break the law.<br />
<br />
It’s clear that the system still needs more knowledge about Chinese roads in general, because it kept mistaking bike lanes for right turn lanes, etc. One driver racked up 7 tickets within the span of a single drive after driving through bike lanes and crossing over solid lines. If a driver gets enough points on their license, they could even have their license suspended. 
</blockquote>
Why did Tesla roll out their $8K "Intelligent Assisted Driving" in China? It might have something to do with <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/03/25/tesla-drops-fsd-from-name-of-its-driver-assist-tech-in-china/">this</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
BYD recently pushed a software update giving <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/02/10/byds-most-affordable-evs-smart-driving-upgrade-free/">smart driving features to all of its vehicles – for free</a>.
</blockquote>
There are already many competing robotaxi services in China. <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/east-asia/china-robotaxis-baidu-tesla-driverless-vehicles-4670506">For example</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Baidu is already operating robotaxi services in multiple cities in China. It provided close to 900,000 rides in the second quarter of the year, up 26 per cent year-on-year, according to its latest earnings call. More than 7 million robotaxi rides in total had been operated as of late July.
</blockquote>
That was a year ago. It isn't just Waymo that is in a whole different robotaxi league than Tesla. And lets not talk about the fact that BYD, <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/04/elon-musk-threat-or-menace-part-6.html">Xiaomi</a> and others outsell Tesla in China because their products are better and cheaper. Tesla's response? Getting the White House to put a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-26/trump-prepares-auto-tariff-announcement-as-soon-as-wednesday">25% tariff on imported cars</a>.<br />

## My new linkblog feed

date: 2025-07-01, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>This is the address of my linkblog feed: <a href="https://dave.linkblog.org/">dave.linkblog.org</a>. </p>
<p>I think it's kind of interesting to have the top page of a site be a feed. I don't hide the XML-ness of it. I never supported the obfuscation, it's confusing, makes people not trust RSS, imho. </p>
<p>I think the feed is pretty stable now, so if you want to subscribe, go ahead. I haven't redirected from the old feed yet, probably should do that soon, since it more or less has stopped updating. </p>
<p>This is all managed in <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a> and therefore is part of the WordPress ecosystem. </p>
<p>I felt it was time to do a definitive linkblog, since as far as I could tell no one has tried to explain what it is: basically, a feed where the &lt;link> element of each &lt;item> points to some other site. That's the basic difference.  </p>
<p>Also a linkblog feed should specify the channel-level &lt;image> element, which is used as the avatar for the feed when it appears in a twitter-like timeline.</p>
<p>I think the only other product that is open to feeds being part of the open social web is <a href="https://about.flipboard.com/press/announcing-surf-the-first-browser-for-the-open-social-web/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Surf</a> from Mike McCue's company, Flipboard. I asked ChatGPT to <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6863cadb-46ec-8012-9ec8-c5e67595f954">brief me</a> on how it works with feeds, and saw that we're more or less doing the same thing, except I'm not trying to work with the output from Twitter, Bluesky, etc. Even when they have outbound RSS feeds they aren't good enough to be part of the social web defined by feeds.</p>
<p>I only want really good feeds. It's time to stop being so careless about what we transmit to the world. If we want an open web we're all going to have to be good gardeners. It's like a food system where all the food is grown by family farmers and I'm running a restaurant, and only want the good stuff, and we want it to look good too! :-)</p>

## What Founders Can Learn From Topaz Labs

date: 2025-06-30, from: Om Malik blog

I recently interviewed Eric Yang,&#160;the&#160;chief executive officer of Dallas, Texas-based visual AI&#160;company&#160;Topaz&#160;Labs,&#160;for my newsletter, CrazyStupidTech. His father,&#160;Albert,&#160;started the business. The company stands in sharp contrast to our&#160;valuation-obsessed&#160;startup culture known for blitzscaling, infinite venture&#160;funding,&#160;and hypergrowth. Topaz is bootstrapped and has quietly built a $48 million business by breaking nearly every Silicon Valley rule. Here are some &#8230;

## Do a backup now

date: 2025-06-30, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Advice from a longtime developer. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you think "I should do a backup," do it. Now, don't wait. </li>
<li>Make it really easy to do a backup. Choose a menu item that's always available when you're working.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason is karma. God hears all your thoughts. When that thought pops into your head and you don't do a backup, or don't do it soon enough, He crashes your data, and you think "I should have done a backup when I thought of doing it." Even this doesn't please Him. At that moment it's even more urgent that you do a backup. </p>
<p>My hippie uncle taught me this. God has a terrible sense of humor, and thinks it's really funny when you have a good thought and ignore it. When something didn't work he would say that's God goofing on me. </p>
<p>In this case, we're talking about is the Programmer God. There are all kinds of gods, a <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1995/04/24/thebaseballgod.html">baseball god</a>, a basketball god, and very specifically a Knicks god. That god has the absolutely worst sense of humor of them all and by worst I mean best. </p>

Another <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/322#issuecomment-3018828658">criticism</a> of the Bluesky API. They make each developer do the support for Open Graph metadata, when it would be much more efficient for them to support it on their end. I would be happy to give them the code. It's not that complicated. But translating the OG format, which for crying out loud is a huge standard, into their arcane format which is only supported by Bluesky, is going in the wrong direction, and frankly is ridiculously arrogant. Show a little humility. Facebook is huge, and the format isn't just used by Facebook, everyone uses it.

## How Cybersecurity Fears Affect Confidence in Voting Systems

date: 2025-06-30, updated: 2025-06-29, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>American democracy runs on trust, and that trust is cracking.</p>
<p>Nearly half of Americans, both Democrats and Republicans, question whether elections are <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/651185/partisan-split-election-integrity-gets-even-wider.aspx">conducted fairly</a>. Some voters accept election results only <a href="https://worldjusticeproject.org/our-work/research-and-data/rule-law-united-states">when their side wins</a>. The problem isn&#8217;t just political polarization&#8212;it&#8217;s a creeping <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/10/29/elections-in-america-concerns-over-security-divisions-over-expanding-access-to-voting/">erosion of trust</a> in the machinery of democracy itself.</p>
<p>Commentators blame ideological tribalism, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/09/business/media/election-disinformation-2024.html">misinformation campaigns</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/15/opinion/social-media-polarization-democracy.html">partisan echo chambers</a> for this crisis of trust. But these explanations miss a critical piece of the puzzle: a growing unease with the digital infrastructure that now underpins nearly every aspect of how Americans vote...</p>

## A tough place to govern

<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benjaminwittes.lawfaremedia.org/post/3lsrm5apzpk27">Benjamin Wittes</a>: "It’s remarkable how many non-New Yorkers seem to care who the mayor of New York City is." </p>
<p>They do and they're right to, the same way we were concerned how the Governor of California and Mayor of Los Angeles would react to the invasion of the Marines and hijacking of the National Guard. </p>
<p>Right now the NYC mayor is a hostage of the US govt. Not in a position to help. An inexperienced first term NY mayor, have we seen that before? How does the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=io7hOfnMldY">NYPD respond</a> to that? </p>
<p>Then there was the <a href="https://www.newyorkalmanack.com/2019/01/lindsays-snowstorm-a-rising-star-falls-to-earth-in-queens/">snowstorm</a> that derailed John V Lindsay, a heroic and transformative mayor. NY is a tough place to govern even when the US government isn't aiming to regime change the place.</p>

<p>Local government is our last line of defense. </p>

<p>But think about the context the next mayor will govern in.</p>
<p>The thing about NY that people might not understand is that the politics are dirty and fucked up. Dems tend to elect handsome young heros who when they have to deal with NYPD and the sanitation workers, the teachers union, and the federal government, also the ancient infrastructure, melt.</p>

## The best job in the world

date: 2025-06-29, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Now that we know the outcome of the 2024 election, not just in numbers but in what it's doing to our beloved country and the rest of the world, it's interesting to revisit the campaign that journalism ran last year to force President Biden to step aside. That's one of the functions of Facebook, they play back your posts from years ago, so you can see how things changed, or didn't. </p>
<p>Anyway, last year on this day I <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid0254HASiWbtuPTJvn29xiHUgPDUuS4yqHfQwtLHMn9xPADiTbqkyY6KauyCGn58o69l">wrote this</a> on Facebook: "Why don't journalists cover the Biden base? Do they even consider the possibility that there is one? Or do they think they are the base? I thought they weren't supposed to care who the nominees are? Why do they feel entitled to say one candidate should withdraw but not the other? Have any of them even thought this through?"</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B06VVR3DX6/about?ccs_id=add77910-b4f6-4323-80d0-494d4da9650f">Nick Arnett</a>, a former tech journalist, said in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/pfbid0254HASiWbtuPTJvn29xiHUgPDUuS4yqHfQwtLHMn9xPADiTbqkyY6KauyCGn58o69l?comment_id=399566229765683">comment</a>: "Until I read this, the madness of the Times calling on Biden, but not Trump, to withdraw didn't dawn on me." </p>
<p>I had followed his metamorphosis over years from a journalist to a worker who goes where there are fires or other natural disasters, for the government, to support the effort to save people's homes and lives. I watched him via Facebook, in awe, as he went around the country, <s>not being paid very much I imagine, but</s> doing good. </p>
<p>I learned something important when my father was in the hospital many years ago, in a coma, after losing a lot of blood and being unconscious for hours before he was found. He was in a ward in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flushing_Hospital_Medical_Center">Flushing Hospital</a>, along with a lot of other comatose people. All were unconscious, unable to feed themselves. Hard to know if they had any awareness. From an outside perspective they, and my father included, were lost. Some had been there for years, probably weren't ever going to come out of it. We were lucky, my father survived, after a month, and had seven more years to live.  </p>
<p>I visited him every day, and got to know the flow of the hospital. Workers came in and out of the room to attend to these comatose people. Imagine the kind of support they needed just to keep their bodies functioning and not wasting away for lack of movement. I thought these people must have the worst jobs imaginable, imagining myself in their shoes.</p>
<p>I got to know them, asked about what else they do, how they got here, where they live, etc. Somehow I got up the courage to ask one of them if they liked their job, imagining I'd get a New Yorker comment like "You know, it's a living." But what I heard was a complete surprise. "It's the best job in the world," he said, because I can see so clearly how my work helps real people. He was looking right at me. It hit me, this man is doing what I can't do, what my father's parents, who were long gone, couldn't do. <i>Caring.</i> Caring for my dad. Then I got it.  </p>
