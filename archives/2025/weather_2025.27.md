Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0728 AM CDT Mon Jul 07 2025

Valid 071300Z - 081200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PORTIONS
OF THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe storms are likely across the central into northern
Plains. Severe wind gusts and large hail are the main threats.
Isolated damaging winds are also possible across parts of the Lower
Great Lakes, Ohio River Valley, and the Northeast.

...Central High Plains into the northern Plains...
A shortwave trough within westerly mid-level flow will move
east/southeast across the central/northern Plains through tonight,
along the periphery of a meridionally-expanding upper-level ridge.
Steep mid-level lapse rates will expand east across the central
Plains, above a moist boundary layer (generally 60s F dew points)
and contributing to strong instability this afternoon with MLCAPE at
or above 2500 J/kg. Thunderstorms are expected to develop this
afternoon across the higher terrain over the central High Plains,
and move east through this evening. Initial supercells will be
capable of large to very large hail, though transitioning into one
or more MCSs with an increase in damaging wind potential, including
significant severe gusts.

Thunderstorms are also expected to develop/re-intensify, across
central/eastern SD along a surface trough, with upscale growth into
an MCS capable of severe winds as it moves east, potentially into
southwest MN this evening before weakening. Given expectations for
greater coverage based on latest hi-res guidance, the Level
3/Enhanced Risk has been extended north across eastern SD/southwest
MN based on higher (30%) severe wind probabilities.

...Upper Ohio River Valley, Lower Great Lakes, and the Northeast...
A cold Front will move east today, and inpinge upon a moist (PW at
or above 1.75 in) and moderately unstable air mass, with afternoon
MLCAPE ranging from near 1000 J/kg across ME to 1500-2000 J/kg over
the upper OH Valley. The area will located along the southern fringe
of modest southwest mid-level flow, sufficient for some degree of
updraft organization. Scattered multicell/clusters of thunderstorms
developing this afternoon will pose a risk for strong/damaging gusts
with isolated stronger storms.  

...Lower Ohio Valley into Ozarks...
Scattered thunderstorms this afternoon developing in the vicinity of
a southward-advancing cold front will have the potential for
isolated wet microbursts within a moist (PW 1.75 to over 2 inches)
air mass. Weak cloud-bearing layer shear should limit organization,
but overall storm coverage should be sufficient for isolated
damaging gusts.

## SPC Jul 7, 2025 Day 4-8 Severe Weather Outlook

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/exper/day4-8/"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/exper/day4-8/day48prob.gif" border="1" alt="Day 4-8 Outlook Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="815" height="555" align="center" /></a><pre>
Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0342 AM CDT Mon Jul 07 2025

Valid 101200Z - 151200Z

...DISCUSSION...
The Southwest upper ridge will gradually flatten as a more
progressive mid-level flow regime becomes established over the
northern CONUS later this week into early next week. Multiple
pronounced mid-level troughs, with cooler temperatures aloft, will
traverse the north-central U.S. and overspread rich low-level
moisture. Strong buoyancy will precede these troughs, and upon
lifting of this unstable airmass, at least scattered organized
thunderstorm development should ensue, with multiple rounds of
strong to severe storms possible.

...Day 4 (Thursday) - Northern Plains...
The first in a series of mid-level troughs will eject into the
northern Plains on Day 4/Thursday, encouraging surface lee troughing
across the central and northern Plains. Dewpoints into the 70s F,
beneath 8+ C/km mid-level lapse rates, will support strong to
locally extreme instability by afternoon peak heating. The ejection
of the upper trough will provide enough upper support for scattered
thunderstorm development. Increasing westerly flow with height will
result in straight, elongated hodographs. Supercells should be the
main mode of convection, at least initially, with severe wind and
hail the primary threats.

...Days 5-6 (Friday-Saturday) - Midwest toward the Great Lakes...
The main mid-level trough will continue to slowly approach the Upper
MS Valley as a preceding mid-level impulse continues to advance
eastward. Potential exists for renewed thunderstorm development for
portions of the Upper MS Valley and Midwest on Friday, spreading
east with upper trough advancement toward the Great Lakes on
Saturday. Rich low-level moisture beneath steep mid-level lapse
rates will promote strong instability in the warm sector, amid
modest vertical wind shear. Somewhere in this region, strong to
severe storms are likely, with severe wind/hail the main concerns on
both Friday and Saturday. The timing and location of thunderstorm
initiation will be highly dependent on the position of remnant
outflow boundaries from storms during previous days. Such details
are quite challenging to point out this far in advance, precluding
severe probabilities at this time, though probabilities will likely
be needed in future outlooks.

...Days 7-8 (Sunday-Monday) - Upper Mississippi Valley...
The next in a series of mid-level troughs will traverse the
north-central CONUS toward the end of the period. Medium-range
guidance consensus depicts extreme instability (i.e. well over 4000
J/kg MLCAPE) preceding this trough, along with strong enough
westerly mid-level flow and accompanying vertical wind shear. As
such, another episode of organized severe storms is possible in the
Sunday/Monday time-frame. However, given the seasonal weak forcing
associated with this second low-amplitude trough, run-to-run
guidance consistency is desired before severe probabilities are
delineated.

Areas affected...north-central North Carolina into far southern

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 062044Z - 062215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A brief tornado or strong wind gust will remain possible
with the convection near the remnant core of TD Chantal.

DISCUSSION...Afternoon imagery shows the remnants of TD Chantal
located across portions of north-central NC near 34.4 deg N 79.2 deg
W. Within the broader precip shield, a few deeper convective towers
have remained strong with occasional cyclonic rotation observed.
Enhanced low-level shear (0-1km SRH near 200 m2/s2) near the remnant
center will remain strong enough to support occasional low-level
mesocyclones with this convection. Despite weak buoyancy (MLCAPE
(~500 J/kg) the moist surface environment and some deeper storms may
remain capable of a brief tornado two and damaging gust into this
evening. Widespread severe weather is not anticipated, and the
interaction of the circulation with higher terrain to the west
should slowly limit the threat tonight.

0326 PM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025

Areas affected...portions of northern Maine

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 062026Z - 062200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated to widely scattered thunderstorms, including a
few supercells, may pose a risk for damaging gusts and small hail
this afternoon/evening. A WW is unlikely.

DISCUSSION...As of 2020 UTC, regional radar and satellite imagery
showed convection was strengthening across portions of Maine. As
temperatures have warmed into the upper 70s to low 80s, around 1000
J/kg of MLCAPE has developed with dewpoints in the 60s. While not
overly strong, this buoyancy should continue to support occasional
stronger updrafts with convection across the region. Deep-layer
shear is supportive of storm organization with the KCBW VAD showing
an elongated hodograph and 30-45 kt of bulk shear. Weak mid-level
rotation has already been observed and the environment suggests a
few supercell/organized multi cell structures are possible. With
poor lapse rates and relatively limited buoyancy, damaging gusts
still appear to be the primary risk. However, some small hail and a
brief tornado are possible with the stronger rotating storms.

HRRR guidance and observations suggests additional storm
development/intensification is plausible this afternoon with more
storms developing/moving in from eastern Canada this evening. While
some severe risk is possible, confidence in severe coverage is low
owing to weak forcing and limited buoyancy. Convective trends are
being monitored, but a WW is currently unlikely.

Areas affected...Eastern New Mexico

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 061918Z - 062145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms emanating off the southern Rockies will pose
an isolated severe wind/hail threat through the late afternoon and
early evening hours. Watch issuance is not expected.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm development within the Sangre de Cristo
and Sacramento mountains is evident in recent GOES imagery. Weak
mid-level flow over the region will likely result in slow storm
propagation off the higher terrain, but as this occurs storms will
eventually move into an unseasonably moist air mass downstream
(dewpoint values in the 75th-90th percentile for early July). This
moisture is contributing to around 1000-1500 J/kg MLCAPE that should
promote thunderstorm maintenance, and possibly intensification,
through late evening. A combination of semi-discrete cells and
propagating clusters is expected with an attendant threat for
isolated large hail (most likely near/below 1.25 inch in diameter)
and sporadic severe wind gusts. The overall severe threat is
expected to remain relatively isolated given the modest kinematic
environment, which should preclude the need for watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1578
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0138 PM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025

Areas affected...Northeast Colorado to southeast Wyoming and western
Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 061838Z - 062115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms developing within the higher terrain of the
central Rockies will spread east and intensify through the
afternoon. As this occurs, the threat for severe winds, and possibly
large hail, will increase. Watch issuance is probable later this
afternoon as thunderstorms increase in coverage and intensity.

DISCUSSION...Latest GOES imagery and lightning data shows a gradual
uptick in convection within the higher terrain of central to
northern CO and far southern WY as daytime heating drives increasing
orographic ascent within a weakly capped air mass. This initial
activity is expected to spread east into the High Plains over the
coming hours given 30-40 knot westerly flow within the CAPE-bearing
layer. Storm intensification is expected as convection overspreads a
relatively moist low-level air mass (dewpoints remain in the mid to
upper 50s downstream) and as lingering inhibition is removed via
deepening boundary-layer heating/mixing. 

Across southeast WY and western NE, slightly stronger zonal flow
aloft coupled with weak easterly low-level winds should promote
adequate deep-layer shear for a couple of supercells with an
attendant large hail risk (possibly up to 2 inches in diameter). The
tornado threat may also be locally greatest across this region due
to augmented low-level shear/SRH on the immediate cool side of a
residual outflow boundary emanating out of central NE.

Further south across CO, observed dewpoint depressions and
short-term forecast soundings suggest LCL heights should approach
2.5 to 3 km as temperatures warm into the upper 80s, which will
promote strong downdraft evaporative cooling and accelerations as
well as rapid cold pool production. Strong to severe downburst winds
and sporadic large hail appear likely within initially discrete
cells moving off the terrain and/or developing within the DCVZ, but
upscale growth into organized clusters is anticipated later this
afternoon/evening with a more widespread severe wind risk (with
gusts possibly as high as 70-80 mph). Watch issuance is probable as
these threats begin to emerge in the coming hours.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 489
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
120 PM MDT Sun Jul 6 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northeast Colorado
  Nebraska Panhandle
  Southeast Wyoming

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 120 PM until
  800 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 75
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail likely with isolated very large hail events
    to 2 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will intensify through the afternoon off the
foothills of northeast Colorado and southeast Wyoming.  A few severe
storms are expected, capable of large hail and damaging wind gusts
through the early evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles east and west of a line from 15 miles east northeast
of Torrington WY to 50 miles south southeast of Limon CO. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 65 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
27030.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0248 PM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...Far Northern California and Southern Oregon...
Strengthening mid-level flow and associated weak ascent with a
closed low off the coast of Northern CA combined with daytime
boundary layer destabilization will provide for some isolated
convection across the higher terrain of northern CA into
south-central OR along and near the Cascades. Drier, more receptive
fuels exist across far northwestern CA where recent precipitation
was limited. In addition, gusty outflow winds from thunderstorms
could impact ongoing fires across northern CA as well promoting new
fire starts with limited precipitation expected. Isolated dry
thunderstorm highlights were introduced to cover this threat.

..Williams.. 07/06/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1255 AM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level ridge should remain in place over the southern Rockies
through the day on Monday with a cutoff low off the California
coast. The height gradient between these two features is expected to
strengthen throughout the day, which may allow for a corridor of
stronger surface flow (15-20 mph) with 5-10% RH across portions of
southern Nevada. However, confidence in the overlap of this stronger
surface flow with receptive fuels is not high. Therefore, will hold
off on introducing Elevated highlights at this time.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0242 PM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025

Valid 062000Z - 071200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND
EVENING OVER PORTIONS OF THE CENTRAL PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered storms capable of producing severe wind gusts and large
hail are expected along the central High Plains. Large hail and
significant severe gusts are possible.

...20z Update...
The Marginal Risk was expanded into portions of central Nebraska
with this update. Storms along a decaying MCS/outflow boundary have
shown intensification. The air mass ahead of this southward moving
boundary remains favorably unstable, though shear for organization
does decrease with eastward extent. See MCD#1579 for more
information.

The Slight Risk across the central Plains continues on track with
thunderstorms developing across the high terrain in Colorado.
Initial supercells with pose a risk for large hail before the
damaging wind risk increases this afternoon/evening. See MCD#1578
and Watch #489 for more information.

..Thornton.. 07/06/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1109 AM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025/

...Eastern WY/CO and western NE/KS...
Subtle mid-level forcing will overspread eastern WY/CO this
afternoon as a weak shortwave trough and associated mid-level speed
max approach.  Surface dewpoints are a little higher than yesterday,
with greater CAPE aiding in the development of scattered afternoon
storms over the foothills and along the DCVZ.  Very steep mid-level
lapse rates and 30kt+ of deep layer shear will promote a few
supercell structures capable of large hail.  As the storms build
eastward, congealing updrafts will likely result in a greater risk
of damaging winds through the evening over northeast CO and western
NE/KS.

...Central Plains to IN/MI...
A weak surface boundary extends from south-central KS across MO/IL
into parts of IN/Lower MI.  Morning visible imagery shows pockets of
strong heating to the south of the boundary, where steep low-level
lapse rates and ample CAPE will be present.  Scattered thunderstorms
are expected to develop along the entire length of the boundary
later today.  Winds aloft are sufficiently strong over MI/IN for
some convective organization, with occasional bowing structures
capable of damaging wind gusts.  From IN southwestward, weak
steering flow will result in slow-moving multicell storms with
occasional intense downdrafts.  

...NC...
TD Chantal is moving slowly northward into central NC.  A large
shield of cloud cover surrounding the center is limiting heating,
and low-level shear profiles have not been particularly strong. 
Nevertheless, 12z CAM solutions generally agree that the strongest
updrafts today will be near and just northeast of the circulation
center.  A tornado or two is possible this these storms, and in any
more isolated convection that might form in the outer bands over
eastern NC.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0230 PM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PARTS OF
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS INTO THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...AND ACROSS THE
MID ATLANTIC...

...SUMMARY...
A few strong storms capable of isolated damaging gusts are possible
from the Southern Plains into the Mid-Mississippi Valley, and from
the Carolinas into the Northeast on Tuesday.

...Discussion...
A shortwave trough is forecast to move quickly from the mid MO
Valley eastward across much of the Midwest, with a weak surface low
moving from IA/northern MO into IL. Meanwhile, an upper ridge will
remain over the Four Corners states.

Substantial model uncertainty exists regarding convective evolution
and the precise locations of the greatest risk areas over the
central CONUS, and where early day storms may stabilize the air mass
over the Plains. However, moderate instability will exist from the
central/southern Plains into the mid MS Valley, suggesting areas of
stronger storms. Morning storms are most likely from KS into MO and
OK, and some of these could produce strong gusts. Otherwise, the
general corridor from northwestern TX into southern IL appears to
coincide with stronger instability and localized wind potential.

To the east, a diurnal surface trough will develop over the Mid
Atlantic, where heating of a moist air mass will yield tall/moist
CAPE profiles in a weak shear environment. Scattered storms clusters
are likely to develop within the uncapped air mass from the central
Carolinas across eastern VA and up the I-95 corridor, with localized
downbursts.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1229 PM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER MUCH OF
CENTRAL NEBRASKA AND SMALL PARTS OF SURROUNDING STATES...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe storms are likely across the central Plains on
Monday. Damaging wind and hail are the main threats. Isolated strong
to potentially severe storms are also possible from parts of New
York into Maine.

...Central High Plains into the northern Plains...
A shortwave trough will move east/southeast across the northern
Plains and into the mid MO to upper MS Valley on Monday, with
moderate northwest winds aloft. Midlevel temperatures will also be
relatively cool, with -10 C at 500 mb as far south as KS.

At the surface, a trough will develop from central SD into western
NE and northeast CO, while southerly winds aid air mass recovery
across the region. Storms will likely develop both along a cold
front over the Dakotas, and extending southward as activity develops
off the Front Range. 

Forecast soundings indicate over 2000 J/kg is likely over much of
the warm sector, which will support strong to severe storms. A few
supercells will be possible initially with large hail and even a
brief tornado, before storms congeal into an MCS during the evening
with damaging winds likely.

...Parts of the Lower Great Lakes and Northeast...
As a low-amplitude wave moves across Ontario and Quebec, height
tendencies will remain rather neutral over the Northeast during the
day. A surface trough and front will stretch roughly along the
Canadian border, with upper 60s F dewpoints common. 

Daytime heating will lead to around 1000-1500 J/kg MLCAPE, and
storms are likely to form within this moist and uncapped air mass
from western NY into northern New England. Modest 30 kt midlevel
westerlies and favorable time of day with a deepening mixed boundary
layer may support locally strong gusts capable of damage.

Locally elevated breezy and dry conditions are expected today across
the interior California mountains/Mojave desert as well as the Upper
Colorado River Basin. Otherwise, no significant, broad scale fire
weather concerns are expected across CONUS today.

..Williams.. 07/06/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1255 AM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level ridge will continue to build over the southern Rockies
during the day with a cutoff low west of California. Some weak flow
aloft may be mixed down to the surface during the afternoon over
portions of the Great Basin. However, overall surface flow is
expected to remain weak, and even in the presence of low RH, any
Elevated fire conditions should be localized and transient.
Therefore, no highlights have been added at this time.

0751 AM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025

Areas affected...east North Carolina

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 061251Z - 061515Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A marginal increase in tornado potential may occur this
morning as Tropical Storm Chantal continues to move inland. The
overall tornado potential should remain low enough to preclude the
need for a TC-related Tornado Watch. However, trends will be
monitored.

DISCUSSION...A marginal increase in tornado potential may occur this
morning as Tropical Storm Chantal continues to move inland. This
marginal increase would coincide with modest diurnal heating
increasing and several feeder bands streaming inland on the eastern
semicircle of Chantal. The onshore environment containing these
feeder bands has little instability at present and the low-level
storm-relative helicity is on the lower side of land-falling
tropical cyclones. That said, the low-level storm-relative helicity
still remains sufficient for low-level rotation with stronger
thunderstorm updrafts. Present thinking is that the limited
instability and modest low-level helicity should preclude any longer
duration/larger area tornado threat and thus a TC-related tornado
watch is not currently anticipated. However, trends will continue to
be evaluated for increasing buoyancy and/or low-level helicity.

Mesoscale Discussion 1574
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0714 AM CDT Sun Jul 06 2025

Areas affected...southwest South Dakota and north-central Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 061214Z - 061415Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Ongoing thunderstorms should persist for another couple of
hours before weakening. Isolated hail and a damaging wind gust or
two will remain possible in the near term. A watch is not currently
expected.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms continue this morning across southwest
South Dakota along the southwest portion of a remnant MCS that moved
across this region overnight. These thunderstorms appear to be
driven by isentropic ascent focused atop a residual cold pool left
over from the overnight convection. This shows up as strong warm-air
advection centered around 700 MB in regional mesoanalysis.
Mesoanalysis also indicates a rich CAPE reservoir to the southwest
of the ongoing storms, within the thunderstorm source/inflow region,
providing additional buoyancy. With time, diurnal heating should
begin to modify the existing cold pool and weaken the isentropic
ascent/WAA leading to a downward trend in thunderstorm intensity.
Before this weakening occurs, lapse rates do not appear particular
steep this morning per RAP-model forecast soundings, and an
isotherms layer extends upward from the surface to around 800 mb.
This should limit the severe potential to isolated hail and perhaps
a damaging wind gust or two -- realistically only in the most
intense cores.

A watch is not anticipated.
