of gut microbiota before and after pediatric cardiopulmonary bypass
surgery</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundVaried congenital heart disease (CHD) may induce gut
microbiota dysbiosis due to intestinal hypoperfusion or/and hypoxemia.
Microbiota dysbiosis has been found in preoperative infants and
cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) exacerbated it further. However, the
trajectory of gut microbiota from pre- to early post-CPB and one-year
later remains unexplored. We examined this trajectory in the two most
common CHDs, i.e., left-to-right shunt (ventricular septal defect, VSD)
vs. right-to-left shunt (tetralogy of Fallot, TOF).MethodsWe enrolled 13
infants with VSD and 11 with TOF, and collected fecal samples at pre-
and early post-CPB. 10 and 12 age- and gender-matched healthy control
infants were enrolled respectively. We also enrolled 13 and 9 gender-
and CHD diagnosis- and operation-matched one-year post-CPB patients, and
8 age- and gender-matched healthy control children. 16S rRNA sequencing
of fecal samples were performed.ResultsCompared to the control groups,
both VSD and TOF pre-CPB groups had significantly increased
Enterobacteriaceae and Shigella, and decreased Bifidobacterium (Ps ≤
0.049). No significant change in microbial community diversity was
observed between pre- and early post-CPB periods (Ps≥0.227). Compared
with early post-CPB, one-year post-CPB groups had significantly
increased short-chain fatty acids-producing microbes (Ps ≤ 0.025), and
their microbial communities were close to that of the control group
(Ps≥0.102). There was no significant difference in microbial communities
between VSD and TOF groups in any of 3 periods (Ps≥0.055).ConclusionIn
children with VSD or TOF, gut microbiota dysbiosis existed
preoperatively and were not significantly altered by CPB. One-year
post-CPB, microbiota significantly improved towards normal. Similar
microbial communities were found between children with VSD and TOF
throughout the perioperative and long-term postoperative periods.</p>

and immunological characteristics of a novel immortalized bovine
brainstem-derived cell line and its susceptibility to arbovirus
infection</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-13, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Immortalized bovine neuronal cell lines provide a reliable in vitro
model for studying interactions with bovine infectious pathogens that
target the host nervous system. Although we previously established an
immortalized fetal bovine brain-derived FBBC-1 cell line, there are
currently no other bovine neuronal cell lines commonly available. In the
present study, we developed a novel immortalized cell line, IKBM,
derived from the adult bovine brainstem by transferring a SV40 large T
antigen gene using lentiviral vectors, and compared its characteristics
to the FBBC-1 cell line. As with FBBC-1 cells, IKBM cells extended
neurite-like processes in response to agents that increase cytosolic
cyclic AMP levels. A comprehensive analysis using RNA sequencing
demonstrated that both cell lines potentially possess neural progenitor
cell-like properties and differentiate into dopaminergic neuron-like
cells after induction of the outgrowth of neurite-like processes.
Unexpectedly, we found that the mRNAs of multiple immunomodulatory
molecules were highly expressed in IKBM cells, but not in FBBC-1 cells.
Although IKBM cells were susceptible to infection with arboviruses
(Akabane and Chuzan viruses) that cause neurological symptoms in cattle,
viral titers were lower in IKBM cell cultures than in hamster
lung-derived HmLu-1 cell cultures, which are frequently used to isolate
arboviruses. The reduced production of viruses in IKBM cell cultures may
be related to the high expression of immunomodulatory molecules in these
cells. Therefore, IKBM and FBBC-1 cell lines offer the opportunity to
develop unique in vitro models of the bovine nervous system for the
study of host-pathogen interactions based on their respective
properties.</p>

and safety of Saccharomyces boulardii as an adjuvant therapy for the
eradication of Helicobacter pylori: a meta-analysis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundHelicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is highly prevalent
worldwide and is closely associated with many gastric conditions.
Current methods for eradicating H. pylori include triple or quadruple
therapy, including antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, and bismuth
agents; however, with antibiotic abuse and increased drug resistance
rates, the effectiveness of traditional methods is gradually decreasing,
with many adverse effects such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and
intolerance. In recent years, there has been controversy regarding
whether adding Saccharomyces boulardii (S. boulardii) to traditional
therapies is beneficial for eradicating H. pylori.AimTo evaluate the
efficacy and safety of S. boulardii as an adjuvant therapy for the
eradication of H. pylori.MethodsWe systematically searched the PubMed
and Web of Science databases from January 2002 to January 2023. The
primary outcome was the H. pylori eradication rate. The secondary
outcomes included total adverse effects, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
bloating, constipation, nausea, vomiting, taste disorders, and other
adverse reactions. We evaluated the included studies for publication
bias and heterogeneity. Fixed- and random-effects models were used for
studies without and with heterogeneity, respectively, to calculate the
risk ratios (RRs) and conduct sensitivity and subgroup
analyses.ResultsNineteen studies comprising 5,036 cases of H. pylori
infection were included in this meta-analysis. The addition of S.
boulardii to traditional therapy significantly improved the H. pylori
eradication rate [RR=1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08–1.15] and
reduced the incidence of total adverse effects (RR=0.49, 95% CI:
0.37–0.66), diarrhea (RR=0.36, 95% CI: 0.26–0.48), abdominal distension
(RR=0.49, 95% CI: 0.33–0.72), constipation (RR=0.38, 95% CI: 0.26–0.57),
and nausea (RR=0.50, 95% CI: 0.37–0.68). However, it did not reduce the
occurrence of abdominal pain, vomiting, or taste disorders.ConclusionsS.
boulardii supplementation in traditional eradication therapy
significantly improves the H. pylori eradication rate and reduces the
total adverse effects and incidence of diarrhea, bloating, constipation,
and nausea.Systematic review registrationProspero, identifier

id="disruption-of-zinc-homeostasis-reverses-tigecycline-resistance-in-klebsiella-pneumoniae">Disruption
of zinc homeostasis reverses tigecycline resistance in Klebsiella
pneumoniae</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionZinc exhibits potent antimicrobial properties due to its
ability to compromise bacterial structure and protein functionality,
effectively inhibiting and eradicating bacteria. However, bacteria have
evolved mechanisms to expel excess zinc ions from their cells, enabling
them to thrive in environments rich in metal ions at high
concentrations. This evolutionary advancement limits the clinical
application of metal ions as antimicrobial agents. In this study, we
aimed to investigate the potential of zinc ionophores to overcome
bacterial resistance by elevating intracellular zinc ion
levels.MethodsWe employed the zinc ionophore PBT2 to elevate
intracellular zinc ion levels in Klebsiella pneumoniae, a bacterium
known for its resistance to various antibiotics. By treating K.
pneumoniae with PBT2, we aimed to assess its impact on bacterial
resistance to tigecycline, an antibiotic commonly used in clinical
settings. The changes in intracellular zinc ion levels, superoxide
dismutase activity, reactive oxygen species concentration, and cell wall
synthesis pathway were monitored to evaluate the mechanism of action of
PBT2.ResultsOur results revealed that PBT2 successfully reversed the
resistance of K. pneumoniae to tigecycline. Specifically, PBT2 increased
the concentration of intracellular zinc ions in K. pneumoniae, leading
to a suppression of superoxide dismutase activity within the cell and an
elevation of reactive oxygen species concentration. These changes
impaired the oxidative stress response of the bacteria. Additionally,
the disruption of zinc homeostasis significantly inhibited the cell wall
synthesis pathway in K. pneumoniae, potentially restricting the efflux
pump mechanism that predominantly drives tigecycline
resistance.DiscussionThe findings of this study pave the way for
innovative strategies and approaches in the clinical development of
novel antimicrobial agents. By using zinc ionophores such as PBT2 to
elevate intracellular zinc ion levels, we can overcome bacterial
resistance to antibiotics like tigecycline. The suppression of
superoxide dismutase activity and elevation of reactive oxygen species
concentration suggest that PBT2 impairs the oxidative stress response of
K. pneumoniae, further enhancing its susceptibility to antibiotics.
Furthermore, the inhibition of the cell wall synthesis pathway and
restriction of the efflux pump mechanism provide additional mechanisms
by which PBT2 reverses antibiotic resistance. These results highlight
the potential of zinc ionophores as a novel class of antimicrobial
agents and warrant further investigation into their clinical
applications.</p>

reference microbiome profiles of different body habitats in healthy
individuals</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThis study aimed to establish the human reference
microbiome profiles in blood, saliva, and stool of healthy individuals,
serving as reference values to identify microbiome alterations in human
disease.MethodsThe study population consisted of a reference group of
healthy adults and a second group consisting of adults with periodontal
disease (PD). Blood, saliva, and stool samples were subjected to 16S
rRNA sequencing. Reference intervals of alpha diversity indices were
calculated. To reduce the effects of inherent limitations of microbiome
data, the taxonomic profiles of the reference group were estimated as
log-scaled fold change (logFC) in the abundance of microorganisms
between two habitats within the subjects. ResultsFor stool and saliva
microbiomes, differences in the abundances of Firmicutes,
Patescibacteria, and Verrucomicrobia distinguished healthy from PD
subjects (95% confidence interval (CI) of logFC: [−0.18, 0.31], [−1.19,
−0.34], and [−3.68, −2.90], respectively). Differences in the abundances
of Cyanobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Tenericutes in stool and blood
microbiome of healthy subjects fell within 95% CI of logFC [−0.38,
0.61], [−4.14, −3.01], and [1.66, 2.77], respectively. In saliva and
blood, differences in the abundances of Epsilonbacteraeota, Firmicutes,
Fusobacteria, and Proteobacteria could be used as reference values (95%
CI of logFC: [−3.67, −2.47], [−0.35, 0.49], [−4.59, −3.26], and [−1.20,
0.07], respectively).DiscussionAs the reference microbiome profiles
could discern healthy subjects and individuals with PD, a relatively
mild disease state, they can be applied as reference values representing
the healthy status of the microbiome and for screening of disease
states, preferably in preclinical stages.</p>

endothelial growth factor A: friend or foe in the pathogenesis of HIV
and SARS-CoV-2 infections?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>This review article discusses the role of vascular endothelial growth
factor A (VEGF-A) in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV infection,
both conditions being renowned for their impact on the vascular
endothelium. The processes involved in vascular homeostasis and
angiogenesis are reviewed briefly before exploring the interplay between
hypoxia, VEGF-A, neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), and inflammatory pathways. We
then focus on SARS-CoV-2 infection and show how the binding of the viral
pathogen to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, as well as to
NRP-1, leads to elevated levels of VEGF-A and consequences such as
coagulation, vascular dysfunction, and inflammation. HIV infection
augments angiogenesis via several mechanisms, most prominently, by the
trans-activator of transcription (tat) protein mimicking VEGF-A by
binding to its receptor, VEGFR-2, as well as upregulation of NRP-1,
which enhances the interaction between VEGF-A and VEGFR-2. We propose
that the elevated levels of VEGF-A observed during HIV/SARS-CoV-2
co-infection originate predominantly from activated immune cells due to
the upregulation of HIF-1α by damaged endothelial cells. In this
context, a few clinical trials have described a diminished requirement
for oxygen therapy during anti-VEGF treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The currently available anti-VEGF therapy strategies target the binding
of VEGF-A to both VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. The blocking of both receptors
could, however, lead to a negative outcome, inhibiting not only
pathological, but also physiological angiogenesis. Based on the
examination of published studies, this review suggests that treatment
targeting selective inhibition of VEGFR-1 may be beneficial in the
context of SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>

of amino acid substitutions in penicillin-binding proteins associated
with adaptation to D-Ala-D-Lac in vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus
faecalis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The bacterial cell wall, essential for structural integrity, is
synthesized with penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).
Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) evades vancomycin by replacing
D-Ala-D-Ala in their cell wall precursors with D-Ala-D-Lac, reducing the
drug’s effectiveness. However, how PBPs-which typically use D-Ala-D-Ala
as a substrate-adapt to recognize D-Ala-D-Lac remains unclear. Here, we
performed Sanger sequencing and alignment of PBP genes from both
vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant E. faecalis strains to identify
mutations, following amplification by PCR. We then applied homology
modeling to assess structural impacts of these changes on PBPs and
conducted docking studies to investigate ligand-binding interactions.
For the first time, we identified specific adaptations in certain VRE
PBPs that may facilitate the D-Ala-D-Lac utilization. We found that
PBP1B, PBP2A, PBP3 showed changes, while PBP1A, PBP2B and PBP4 remained
unchanged. Notably, a threonine-to-asparagine substitution at location
491 in PBP1B leads to a shift in substrate preference from D-Ala-D-Ala
to D-Ala-D-Lac. Similar structural changes in PBP3 suggest that the
presence of changed and unchanged PBPs within the same classes suggests
compensatory interactions, indicating a teamwork among multiple PBPs.
These insights into PBPs provide a deeper understanding of D-Ala-D-Lac
utilization in VRE, may be used to develop new therapeutic agents to
combat vancomycin resistance.</p>

<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Preterm birth (PTB) is a major cause of infant morbidity and
mortality. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of
vaginal microbiota and metabolites on the outcome of pregnant women. In
this study, a total of 127 pregnant women provided written informed
consent prior to enrollment in accordance with the approved
institutional guidelines, but only 45 pregnancies met the experimental
requirements, and then blood and cervical vaginal fluid (CVF) samples
were collected before delivery (at the second week after cervical
cerclage). Pregnant women with PTB exhibited high white blood cell and
neutrophil contents, high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and high
systemic inflammation response index (SIRI) in the blood. Vaginal
microbiome revealed that the proportion of beneficial bacteria
(including Lactobacillus, [Ruminococcus] gnavus group, and Megamonas)
significantly decreased in the PTB group, and the proportion of harmful
bacteria (including Desulfovibrionaceae, Helicobacter, and Gardnerella)
significantly increased, which is strongly related to the biochemical
parameters of blood (white blood cells, neutrophils, NLR, and SIRI). In
addition, vaginal metabolomics-based liquid
chromatography–Orbitrap–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-Orbitrap-MS/MS)
found that the alteration in vaginal metabolites in pregnant women with
PTB is involved in starch and sucrose metabolism; arginine and praline
metabolism; galactose metabolism; purine metabolism; arginine
metabolism; tryptophan metabolism and N-glycan biosynthesis; cysteine
and methionine metabolism; taurine and hypotaurine metabolism; amino
acid metabolism; propanoate metabolism; valine, leucine, and isoleucine
biosynthesis; glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism; and steroid
hormone biosynthesis. These results elaborated that distinct vaginal
microbiome and metabolome profiles in women with preterm delivery
following cervical cerclage provide valuable information for
establishing the prediction models for PTB.</p>

a machine learning-based approach for immunogenicity prediction in
Salmonella vaccine development</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionAccurate prediction of immunogenic proteins is crucial
for vaccine development and understanding host-pathogen interactions in
bacterial diseases, particularly for Salmonella infections which remain
a significant global health challenge.MethodsWe developed SHASI-ML, a
machine learning-based framework for predicting immunogenic proteins in
Salmonella species. The model was trained and validated using a curated
dataset of experimentally verified immunogenic and non-immunogenic
proteins. Three distinct feature groups were extracted from protein
sequences: global properties, sequence-derived features, and structural
information. The Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm was
employed for model development and optimization.ResultsSHASI-ML
demonstrated robust performance in identifying bacterial immunogens,
achieving 89.3% precision and 91.2% specificity. When applied to the
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium proteome, the model identified
292 novel immunogenic protein candidates. Global properties emerged as
the most influential feature group in prediction accuracy, followed by
structural and sequence information. The model showed superior recall
and F1-scores compared to existing computational
approaches.DiscussionThese findings establish SHASI-ML as an efficient
computational tool for prioritizing immunogenic candidates in Salmonella
vaccine development. By streamlining the identification of vaccine
candidates early in the development process, this approach significantly
reduces experimental burden and associated costs. The methodology can be
applied to guide and optimize both research and industrial-scale
production of Salmonella vaccines, potentially accelerating the
development of more effective immunization strategies.</p>

<p>The dental caries remains a globally prevalent disease. Although its
incidence has decrease due to enhancements in sanitation policies and
public health measures, the treatment and prevention of dental caries
still pose significant challenges. Within the oral cavity, traditional
drug delivery systems suffer from limitation such as inadequate tissue
penetration, short duration of action at target site, and low
specificity, which minimally affect the prevention and treatment of
dental caries. Consequently, nanosystem for drug delivery, offering
enhanced drug stability, solubility, and bio-availability while reducing
side effects, garnering attention increasing attention in the fight
against dental caries. Therefore, this review examines the role of
nanosystems for drug delivery in combating dental caries by inhibiting
bacteria survival, biofilm formation, demineralization, and promoting
remineralization, and exploring their potential to become the mainstream
means of prevention and treatment of dental caries in future.</p>

dysfunction in Crohn’s disease</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionCrohn’s disease (CD) results from alterations in the gut
microbiota and the immune system. However, the exact metabolic
dysfunctions of the gut microbiota during CD are still unclear. Here, we
investigated metagenomic functions using PICRUSt2 during the course of
CD to better understand microbiota-related disease mechanisms and
provide new insights for novel therapeutic strategies.MethodsWe
performed 16S rRNA-based microbial profiling of 567 faecal samples
collected from a cohort of 383 CD patients, including 291 remissions
(CR), 177 mild-moderate (CM) and 99 severe (CS) disease states. Gene and
pathway composition was assessed using PICRUSt2 analyses of 16S
data.ResultsAs expected, changes in alpha and beta diversity, in
interaction networks and increases in Proteobacteria abundance were
associated with disease severity. However, microbial function was more
consistently disrupted than composition from CR, to CM and then to CS.
Major shifts in oxidative stress pathways and reduced carbohydrate and
amino acid metabolism in favour of nutrient transport were identified in
CS compared to CR. Virulence factors involved in host invasion, host
evasion and inflammation were also increased in CS.ConclusionsThis
functional metagenomic information provides new insights into
community-wide microbial processes and pathways associated with CD
pathogenesis. This study paves the way for new advanced strategies to
rebalance gut microbiota and/or eliminate oxidative stress, and biofilm
to downregulate gut inflammation.</p>

<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The oral microbiome comprises over 700 distinct species, forming
complex biofilms essential for maintaining oral and systemic health.
When the microbial homeostasis in the periodontium is disrupted,
pathogens within the biofilm can cause periodontitis and
peri-implantitis, inducing host immune responses. Understanding the role
of microbial communities and the immune mechanisms in oral health and
disease is crucial for developing improved preventive, diagnostic and
therapeutic strategies. However, many questions remain about how changes
in bacterial populations contribute to the development and progression
of these conditions. An electronic and manual literature search was
conducted using PubMed, Excerpta Medica, Frontiers Reports and the Wiley
Online Library databases for relevant articles. Data from these
publications were extracted and the overall findings were summarized in
a narrative manner. The variations in microbial communities and immune
responses of periodontitis and peri-implantitis are explored. Dysbiosis
of the subgingival microbiome—characterized by an increase in pathogenic
bacteria such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and
Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans—plays a pivotal role in the
initiation and progression of periodontitis. As for peri-implantitis,
alterations include a higher abundance of opportunistic pathogens and
reduced microbial diversity around implants. Moreover, oral dysbiosis
potentially influencing systemic health through immune-mediated
pathways. Regional immunity of periodontium involving neutrophils, T
helper cells-17, and immune-related cytokines is crucial for maintaining
periodontal homeostasis and responding to microbial imbalances.
Additionally, the impact of non-mechanical treatments—such as probiotics
and laser therapy—on the oral microbiome is discussed, demonstrating
their potential in managing microbial dysbiosis. These findings
underscore that bacterial dysbiosis is a central factor in the
development of periodontitis and peri-implantitis. Maintaining microbial
balance is essential for preventing these diseases, and interventions
targeting the microbiome could enhance treatment outcomes. Strategies
focusing on controlling pathogenic bacteria, modulating immune
responses, and promoting tissue regeneration are key to restoring
periodontal stability. Further research is needed to clarify the
mechanisms underlying the transition from peri-implant mucositis to
peri-implantitis and to optimize prevention and treatment approaches,
considering the complex interactions between the microbiome and host
immunity.</p>

and future therapeutic options for chronic hepatitis D virus
infection</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>In the last few years there have been innovations in HDV therapy
which have brought new excitement in the scientific community also
considering the few therapeutic opportunities. Recently, new molecular
targets have been identified, both in monotherapy and in combination
with peginterferon alpha (PegIFNα). Evaluating this review of the
literature of the last ten years, HDV-related chronic hepatitis seems to
have become a potentially curable disease, a statement that was
unthinkable a few years ago. There are old and new weapons at our
disposal. The old weapons are PegIFNα and recently PegIFN-lambda
(PegIFNλ). PegIFNα, for which there are more data, appears to be an
excellent combination regimen, if not contraindicated, both for
Bulevirtide (BLV), data supported by important clinical trials and
real-world studies, and probably for lonarfanib, although in the latter
case the results are not yet definitive as the studies are fewer.
However, data on long-term follow-up are needed.</p>

analysis of the mechanisms conferring resistance to phenamacril in the
Fusarium species</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The filamentous fungal genus Fusarium contains many species that
cause catastrophic diseases in fruits, cereal, and vegetables. These
diseases cause substantial losses in yield and contaminate affected
crops with toxins. This causes huge losses in the agricultural sector
and threatens human and animal health. The most efficient approach to
control the Fusarium spp. is fungicide application. Phenamacril is a
site-specific fungicide that exerts its antifungal effect on sensitive
Fusarium spp. It is a new fungicide developed that targets Fusarium
graminearum by inhibiting myosin-5, an important protein in fungal
growth and disease development. Because of its remarkable specificity,
the new fungicide phenamacril is regarded as environmentally benign.
However, many research findings have reported the emergence of the
resistance of Fusarium spp. to phenamacril in both the field and
laboratory. This article comprehensively analyzes the mechanisms
underlying Fusarium spp. resistance to phenamacril. We examine the
molecular, genetic, and environmental factors contributing to this
resistance. We emphasize the importance of continued research and
integrating different approaches to monitoring and managing
drug-resistant Fusarium spp. populations. Integrating current inventions
to inform strategies for sustainable disease control practices, and
increase plant health, and yield will contribute to ongoing global
efforts to achieve food and nutritional sustainability for the world’s
rapidly growing population while ensuring the effectiveness of the
fungicidal product.</p>

of E-cadherin in epithelial barrier dysfunction: implications for
bacterial infection, inflammation, and disease pathogenesis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Epithelial barriers serve as critical defense lines against microbial
infiltration and maintain tissue homeostasis. E-cadherin, an essential
component of adherens junctions, has emerged as a pivotal molecule that
secures epithelial homeostasis. Lately, its pleiotropic role beyond
barrier function, including its involvement in immune responses, has
become more evident. Herein, we delve into the intricate relationship
between (dys)regulation of epithelial homeostasis and the versatile
functionality of E-cadherin, describing complex mechanisms that underlie
barrier integrity and disruption in disease pathogenesis such as
bacterial infection and inflammation, among others. Clinical
implications of E-cadherin perturbations in host pathophysiology are
emphasized; downregulation, proteolytic phenomena, abnormal
localization/signaling and aberrant immune reactions are linked with a
broad spectrum of pathology beyond infectious diseases. Finally,
potential therapeutic interventions that may harness E-cadherin to
mitigate barrier-associated tissue damage are explored. Overall, this
review highlights the crucial role of E-cadherin in systemic health,
offering insights that could pave the way for strategies to
reinforce/restore barrier integrity and treat related diseases.</p>

of SARS-CoV-2 variants in Henan, China from 2023 to 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveIn January 2023, China implemented the “Class B Management”
policy, marking a new phase in COVID-19 control. As new SARS-CoV-2
variants continue to emerge, some have shown significant immune evasion,
posing challenges to epidemic control efforts. To manage the pandemic
effectively, Henan Province launched a surveillance program for
SARS-CoV-2 variants, systematically analyzing their clinical
characteristics and epidemiological patterns.MethodsThis study collected
genomic sequence data from 5,965 COVID-19 cases between January 1, 2023,
and March 17, 2024, using the Henan Province SARS-CoV-2 variant
surveillance system. Genome sequence analysis was performed with CLC
Genomics Workbench, and genotyping and sequence alignment were carried
out using the Nextclade platform. The clinical severity of different
variants was assessed in relation to patient sex, age, clinical
classification, and vaccination status.ResultsBetween Week 1 of 2023 and
Week 11 of 2024, a total of 5,965 complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences
were obtained, including 3,004 male (50.36%) and 2,961 female (49.64%)
cases. The majority of cases were mild (5,451 cases, 91.38%), followed
by moderate (311 cases, 5.21%) and severe or critical cases (203 cases,
3.4%). The predominant variants included BA.5.2, XBB, and BA.2.86.
BA.5.2 was dominant until April 2023, after which it was gradually
replaced by XBB. From December 2023, BA.2.86 began to increase and
became the predominant variant by January 2024. The XBB variant
exhibited a significantly lower rate of severe cases, with most
infections being mild (P &lt; 0.05). Male patients, the elderly, and
certain variants (e.g., BA.5.2) were associated with more severe
outcomes, while XBB and BA.2.86 showed lower pathogenicity, with a
marked reduction in severe and fatal cases (P &lt; 0.05).ConclusionAs
SARS-CoV-2 variants evolve, the incidence of severe cases has
progressively decreased. Both XBB and BA.2.86 variants exhibit lower
pathogenicity. This study provides vital scientific evidence on the
epidemiological features, clinical manifestations, and control
strategies of SARS-CoV-2 variants. It underscores the importance of
continuous viral surveillance and genomic sequencing to guide public
health decision-making.</p>

and clinical validation of a novel MeltPlus TB-NTM/RIF platform for
simultaneous detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex,
Non-Tuberculous Mycobacteria and rifampicin resistance</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundRapid and accurate diagnosis of tuberculosis, particularly
rifampin (RIF)-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB) and Non-Tuberculous
Mycobacteria (NTM), is essential for implementing appropriate proper
therapy to benefit patients and improve TB/NTM patient
management.MethodsIn this study, we developed a novel MeltPlus
MTB-NTM/RIF platform, designed to simultaneously detect Mycobacterium
tuberculosis complex (MTBC), NTM and RIF resistance. The platform was
evaluated for its limit of detection (LOD) and specificity before
clinical validation, followed by a prospective single-center study in
patients with presumptive TB cases.ResultsThe calculated LOD for MTBC,
NTM and RIF susceptibility was found to be 10.31 CFU/mL, 57.55 CFU/mL
and 48.584 CFU/mL, respectively. The assay showed a sensitivity of
98.76% (95% CI: 96.41-99.74%) and a specificity of 94.42% (95% CI:
90.82-96.92%) for MTBC detection compared to the bacteriological TB
standard. For NTM detection, the assay demonstrated a sensitivity of
91.98% (95% CI: 76.32-98.14%) and a specificity of 99.59% (95% CI:
98.54-99.95%). RIF resistance detection showed a sensitivity of 90.24%
(95% CI:76.87-97.28%) and specificity of 95.98% (95% CI: 91.89-98.37%),
with a high level of diagnostic agreement (Kappa: 0.8338) compared to
GeneXpert. Sanger sequencing revealed that novel assay correctly
classifies 98.6% of study cases as RIF resistant or susceptible,
slightly higher that of GeneXpert.DiscussionThese findings indicate that
the novel MeltPlus MTB-NTM/RIF platform provides a rapid and accurate
method for the simultaneously detecting MTBC, NTM, and RIF resistance,
making it a promising tool for clinical TB/NTM diagnosis and management,
further multi-center and field studies are recommended to validate its
broader applicability.</p>
