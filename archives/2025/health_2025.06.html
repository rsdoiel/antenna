and clinical validation of a novel MeltPlus TB-NTM/RIF platform for
simultaneous detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex,
Non-Tuberculous Mycobacteria and rifampicin resistance</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundRapid and accurate diagnosis of tuberculosis, particularly
rifampin (RIF)-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB) and Non-Tuberculous
Mycobacteria (NTM), is essential for implementing appropriate proper
therapy to benefit patients and improve TB/NTM patient
management.MethodsIn this study, we developed a novel MeltPlus
MTB-NTM/RIF platform, designed to simultaneously detect Mycobacterium
tuberculosis complex (MTBC), NTM and RIF resistance. The platform was
evaluated for its limit of detection (LOD) and specificity before
clinical validation, followed by a prospective single-center study in
patients with presumptive TB cases.ResultsThe calculated LOD for MTBC,
NTM and RIF susceptibility was found to be 10.31 CFU/mL, 57.55 CFU/mL
and 48.584 CFU/mL, respectively. The assay showed a sensitivity of
98.76% (95% CI: 96.41-99.74%) and a specificity of 94.42% (95% CI:
90.82-96.92%) for MTBC detection compared to the bacteriological TB
standard. For NTM detection, the assay demonstrated a sensitivity of
91.98% (95% CI: 76.32-98.14%) and a specificity of 99.59% (95% CI:
98.54-99.95%). RIF resistance detection showed a sensitivity of 90.24%
(95% CI:76.87-97.28%) and specificity of 95.98% (95% CI: 91.89-98.37%),
with a high level of diagnostic agreement (Kappa: 0.8338) compared to
GeneXpert. Sanger sequencing revealed that novel assay correctly
classifies 98.6% of study cases as RIF resistant or susceptible,
slightly higher that of GeneXpert.DiscussionThese findings indicate that
the novel MeltPlus MTB-NTM/RIF platform provides a rapid and accurate
method for the simultaneously detecting MTBC, NTM, and RIF resistance,
making it a promising tool for clinical TB/NTM diagnosis and management,
further multi-center and field studies are recommended to validate its
broader applicability.</p>
