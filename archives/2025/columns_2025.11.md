## Is Security Human Factors Research Skewed Towards Western Ideas and Habits?

date: 2025-03-18, updated: 2025-03-17, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Really interesting research: &#8220;<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24/presentation/hasegawa">How WEIRD is Usable Privacy and Security Research?</a>&#8221; by  Ayako A. Hasegawa Daisuke Inoue, and Mitsuaki Akiyama:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract</b>: In human factor fields such as human-computer interaction (HCI) and psychology, researchers have been concerned that participants mostly come from WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) countries. This WEIRD skew may hinder understanding of diverse populations and their cultural differences. The usable privacy and security (UPS) field has inherited many research methodologies from research on human factor fields. We conducted a literature review to understand the extent to which participant samples in UPS papers were from WEIRD countries and the characteristics of the methodologies and research topics in each user study recruiting Western or non-Western participants. We found that the skew toward WEIRD countries in UPS is greater than that in HCI. Geographic and linguistic barriers in the study methods and recruitment methods may cause researchers to conduct user studies locally. In addition, many papers did not report participant demographics, which could hinder the replication of the reported studies, leading to low reproducibility. To improve geographic diversity, we provide the suggestions including facilitate replication studies, address geographic and linguistic issues of study/recruitment methods, and facilitate research on the topics for non-WEIRD populations...</p></blockquote>

## Big Ideas for Little Philosophers

date: 2025-03-18, from: Jessica Smith's blog

<p>About a month ago, <a href="https://www.jayeless.net/2025/02/indies-first-library-trip.html" title="Blog post from 15 Feb: Indie&#39;s First Library Trip">I mentioned</a> that we&rsquo;d borrowed a book from this &ldquo;Big Ideas for Little Philosophers&rdquo; series called <cite>Love with Plato</cite>. Even though I made fun of it at the time, it actually struck me as a really nice little book, and since I was curious about what they would say about the other philosophers, I shelled out to order the whole series:</p>

  loading="lazy" class="u-photo"></a>

</div>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to be able to offer a <em>positive</em> baby book review. While I don&rsquo;t think the books in this series have all accurately outlined the core theses of their respective philosophers, they <em>are</em> all really good, thoughtful books that invite kids to grapple with questions about how we can be good and happy people.</p>
<p>I mentioned last time that I wished the library had had <cite>Equality with Simone de Beauvoir</cite>, and that <em>is</em> one of my favourites, now that I&rsquo;ve read it. It explains, in very &ldquo;small child&rdquo;-friendly language, that gender stereotypes are completely artificial, that girls and boys are really much the same (we all cry when we&rsquo;re sad, and smile when we&rsquo;re happy&hellip;), and that everyone is happier when we can be our true selves without judgement. On one page there is also a cute cat rockin&rsquo; out with a walkman and a hula hoop in the corner, so the book gets bonus points for that.</p>
<p>But then the one that really surprised me was <cite>Happiness with Aristotle</cite>, which actually got into a deep rumination on friendship and what it means to be a &ldquo;true friend&rdquo; that I think many adults would benefit from reading. It talks about how some friends make you laugh and feel good to spend time with, and other friends will help you out when you need a hand, but a <em>true</em> friend is actually someone who&rsquo;ll call you out on your shit, so you can grow as a person. (Again, in kid-friendly language.) Not only that, but the book added that before you can be a &ldquo;true friend&rdquo; to others, you need to be a &ldquo;true friend&rdquo; to yourself, which means &ldquo;loving yourself as much as you love your friends&rdquo;. Like… damn! Where was this book when I was 18–19 and stuck in &ldquo;I can fix him!&rdquo; thinking? It&rsquo;s so good! Again, I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s an accurate description of the very core of Aristotelian philosophy, but it&rsquo;s a great message.</p>
<p>The books are board books (you know, the hard cardboard ones usually intended for real babies), but they&rsquo;re full of open-ended questions to elicit discussion with a small child. I would love to read these with Indie when she&rsquo;s, like, five and actually able to engage with the ideas therein. I&rsquo;m glad to have bought our own copies, because I think we&rsquo;ll get a lot of mileage out of them.</p>
<p>Having said this, the series <strong>is</strong> clearly missing a book about one very important philosopher, one they could call something like <cite>Communism with Marx</cite>. I guess we just can&rsquo;t have it all 😔</p>

## Improvements in Brute Force Attacks

date: 2025-03-17, updated: 2025-03-17, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>New paper: &#8220;<a href="https://tosc.iacr.org/index.php/ToSC/article/view/12078/11919">GPU Assisted Brute Force Cryptanalysis of GPRS, GSM, RFID, and TETRA: Brute Force Cryptanalysis of KASUMI, SPECK, and TEA3</a>.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> Key lengths in symmetric cryptography are determined with respect to the brute force attacks with current technology. While nowadays at least 128-bit keys are recommended, there are many standards and real-world applications that use shorter keys. In order to estimate the actual threat imposed by using those short keys, precise estimates for attacks are crucial.</p>
<p>In this work we provide optimized implementations of several widely used algorithms on GPUs, leading to interesting insights on the cost of brute force attacks on several real-word applications...</p></blockquote>

I replaced it with a template in the feeder app which was a useful version of the cute little app. Here's a <a href="https://feeder.scripting.com/?template=jsonify&feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fjeffmilner.com%2F%3Ffeed%3Drss2">demo</a> of it viewing the contents of a feed in JSON using a special template.

## Blogging is due for a refresh

date: 2025-03-16, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>A lot has changed since the last time we took a serious look at blogging. A few items, as examples.</p>
<ol>
<li>When RSS came along Markdown didn't exist. The two technologies belong together, imho.</li>
<li>Websockets have replaced long polling. </li>
<li>Servers got cheap! (and easy to deploy).</li>
<li>SQL is fast and the tools are much better.</li>
<li>The user interfaces of all the Web 2.0+ products didn't exist last time we created new blogging communities. We can borrow ideas from  twitter-like systems, even huge products like Facebook and Spotify have innovations that come long after the initial wave of blogging.</li>
</ol>
<p>But one thing stays the same -- all the components are replaceable. Absolutely zero lock-in. We use simple standard APIs where they exist, and create new minimal formats and protocols where they don't.</p>
<p>Blogging has a simple philosophy that remains constant. </p>

## 2025-03-15 New window manager: niri

date: 2025-03-16, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-03-15-new-window-manager-niri">2025-03-15 New window manager: niri</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m giving <a href="https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri">niri</a> a go.
The idea is that a scrollable tiling window manager
(&ldquo;Wayland compositor&rdquo;) is a better fit than just a tiling window manager.
For tiling window managers, I just create new stuff and have it maximized.
I really can&rsquo;t do the quick splitting and rearranging that it seems to afford.
The result is that I start moving stuff to other workspaces, where they&rsquo;re
invisible and gone.
I&rsquo;m hoping that new windows popping up next to existing windows makes it feel
like a stack.</p>

<p>Having gone through the config file and having made a few small changes it
already feels pretty nice. Right now one of the problems I have is that
by sheer bad luck I decided to rotate my external monitor by 90° and that
doesn&rsquo;t work quite as well, maybe? I&rsquo;m not sure. One of the first changes
I did was change the default widths from ⅓ / ½ / ⅔ to 0.95 / ⅔ / ½ with 0.95 being
the default.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Window_Managers">#Window Managers</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Niri">#Niri</a></p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t find a solution for Gimp. And I already had no solution for VASSAL under Sway. So for these applications, I still have Gnome installed.</p>

<p>Currently my <code>~/.config/fish/conf.d/window-manager.fish</code> says:</p>

<pre><code># If running from tty1 start sway
set TTY (tty)
[ &quot;$TTY&quot; = &quot;/dev/tty1&quot; ] &amp;&amp; exec sway
[ &quot;$TTY&quot; = &quot;/dev/tty2&quot; ] &amp;&amp; exec startx
[ &quot;$TTY&quot; = &quot;/dev/tty3&quot; ] &amp;&amp; exec niri
</code></pre>

<p>Oh well. 😅</p>
