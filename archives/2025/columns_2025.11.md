## Blogging is due for a refresh

date: 2025-03-16, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>A lot has changed since the last time we took a serious look at blogging. A few items, as examples.</p>
<ol>
<li>When RSS came along Markdown didn't exist. The two technologies belong together, imho.</li>
<li>Websockets have replaced long polling. </li>
<li>Servers got cheap! (and easy to deploy).</li>
<li>SQL is fast and the tools are much better.</li>
<li>The user interfaces of all the Web 2.0+ products didn't exist last time we created new blogging communities. We can borrow ideas from  twitter-like systems, even huge products like Facebook and Spotify have innovations that come long after the initial wave of blogging.</li>
</ol>
<p>But one thing stays the same -- all the components are replaceable. Absolutely zero lock-in. We use simple standard APIs where they exist, and create new minimal formats and protocols where they don't.</p>
<p>Blogging has a simple philosophy that remains constant. </p>

## 2025-03-15 New window manager: niri

date: 2025-03-16, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-03-15-new-window-manager-niri">2025-03-15 New window manager: niri</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m giving <a href="https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri">niri</a> a go.
The idea is that a scrollable tiling window manager
(&ldquo;Wayland compositor&rdquo;) is a better fit than just a tiling window manager.
For tiling window managers, I just create new stuff and have it maximized.
I really can&rsquo;t do the quick splitting and rearranging that it seems to afford.
The result is that I start moving stuff to other workspaces, where they&rsquo;re
invisible and gone.
I&rsquo;m hoping that new windows popping up next to existing windows makes it feel
like a stack.</p>

<p>Having gone through the config file and having made a few small changes it
already feels pretty nice. Right now one of the problems I have is that
by sheer bad luck I decided to rotate my external monitor by 90¬∞ and that
doesn&rsquo;t work quite as well, maybe? I&rsquo;m not sure. One of the first changes
I did was change the default widths from ‚Öì / ¬Ω / ‚Öî to 0.95 / ‚Öî / ¬Ω with 0.95 being
the default.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Window_Managers">#Window Managers</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Niri">#Niri</a></p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t find a solution for Gimp. And I already had no solution for VASSAL under Sway. So for these applications, I still have Gnome installed.</p>

<p>Currently my <code>~/.config/fish/conf.d/window-manager.fish</code> says:</p>

<pre><code># If running from tty1 start sway
set TTY (tty)
[ &quot;$TTY&quot; = &quot;/dev/tty1&quot; ] &amp;&amp; exec sway
[ &quot;$TTY&quot; = &quot;/dev/tty2&quot; ] &amp;&amp; exec startx
[ &quot;$TTY&quot; = &quot;/dev/tty3&quot; ] &amp;&amp; exec niri
</code></pre>

<p>Oh well. üòÖ</p>

## ‚òÖ A Postscript on the Singular Nature of Mark Gurman‚Äôs Reporting
