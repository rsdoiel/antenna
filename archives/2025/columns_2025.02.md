## Microsoft Takes Legal Action Against AI ‚ÄúHacking as a Service‚Äù Scheme

date: 2025-01-13, updated: 2025-01-13, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Not sure this will matter in the end, but it&#8217;s a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/microsoft-sues-service-for-creating-illicit-content-with-its-ai-platform/">positive move</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Microsoft is accusing three individuals of running a &#8220;hacking-as-a-service&#8221; scheme that was designed to allow the creation of harmful and illicit content using the company&#8217;s platform for AI-generated content.</p>
<p>The foreign-based defendants developed tools specifically designed to bypass safety guardrails Microsoft has erected to prevent the creation of harmful content through its generative AI services, <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/01/10/taking-legal-action-to-protect-the-public-from-abusive-ai-generated-content/">said</a> Steven Masada, the assistant general counsel for Microsoft&#8217;s Digital Crimes Unit. They then compromised the legitimate accounts of paying customers. They combined those two things to create a fee-based platform people could use...</p></blockquote>

## I am (not) a Failure: Lessons Learned From Six (and a half) Failed Startup Attempts

date: 2025-01-12, updated: 2025-01-12, from: Ron Garret

A while back I wrote:I've had many, many failures in my life.&nbsp; (Hm, maybe I should write a blog post about that.)This is that post.&nbsp; I'm writing it not as a lament, but rather because I've ended up in a good place in life despite my extraordinary track record of failing at just about everything I've ever tried.&nbsp; If my younger self had heard these stories he might 
have had a less

## 2025-01-12 Disk space

date: 2025-01-12, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-01-12-disk-space">2025-01-12 Disk space</h1>

<p>It&rsquo;s that time of the year again. How to get back disk space?</p>

<p>Open the Files application and empty the trash. (How to do this from the command line?)</p>

<p>Delete the cache for Debian packages:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get clean
</code></pre>

<p>Check out local caches:</p>

<pre><code>ncdu .cache/
</code></pre>

<p>Python stuff:</p>

<pre><code>pip cache purge
</code></pre>

<p>Also, feel free to delete other stuff in there. I just deleted a &ldquo;whisper&rdquo; directory containing a language model I didn&rsquo;t need and a &ldquo;tracker3&rdquo; directory containing data for the Gnome miner, I think. Also &ldquo;chromium&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s not my main browser. I don&rsquo;t care about its cache.</p>

<p>Perlbrew stuff. Find out what Perls you have installed.</p>

<pre><code>perlbrew list
</code></pre>

<p>You aren&rsquo;t going to need them:</p>

<pre><code>perlbrew uninstall perl-5.30.0
perlbrew uninstall perl-5.32.0
</code></pre>

<p>Go build cache:</p>

<pre><code>go clean -cache
</code></pre>

cities. This is a compilation of many of the coffees I got to taste.

## Is Bluesky federated like Masto?

date: 2025-01-12, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>This is one of the dialogs you encounter when getting started with Bluesky. It's easy to see how new users might be led believe that Bluesky is federated, as Mastodon is. I'm a developer and I was confused by what it was saying.</p>

<p>The basic definition of terrorism is &ldquo;violence designed to create terror in a civilian population to achieve a political aim&rdquo;. Clearly, not only are states <em>capable</em> of carrying out terrorism, they are by far the primary perpetrators of terrorism in the world. But the UN, being made up of nation-states, has always resisted having a definition of terrorism that acknowledged that, instead including clauses like &ldquo;‚Ä¶by non-nation-state actors&rdquo;. In this way, for example, Israel is &ldquo;not a terrorist state&rdquo;, while the Palestinians defending themselves <em>are</em> terrorists‚Ä¶</p>
<p>And then we reach the modern era, where acts not designed to instill terror in a civilian population at all, like the United Healthcare shooting, get branded as &ldquo;terrorism&rdquo;. Like, according to the ruling class, it&rsquo;s now just terrorism if the ruling class is afraid. No naked self-interest in that at all üôÑ</p>
