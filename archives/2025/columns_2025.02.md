## Social Engineering to Disable iMessage Protections

date: 2025-01-17, updated: 2025-01-16, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>I am always interested in new phishing tricks, and watching them spread across the ecosystem.</p>
<p>A few days ago I started getting phishing SMS messages with a new twist. They were standard messages about delayed packages or somesuch, with the goal of getting me to click on a link and entering some personal information into a website. But because they came from unknown phone numbers, the links did not work. So&#8212;this is the new bit&#8212;the messages said something like: &#8220;Please reply Y, then exit the text message, reopen the text message activation link, or copy the link to Safari browser to open it.&#8221;...</p>

## The Speech Joe Biden Is Likely to be Remembered For.

## A Prophet Of The Web

date: 2025-01-16, from: David Rosenthal's blog

<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh4uNBSGncpDuahU327woHMV6IbSTAfHghJt5sruliN1APCfR4xjwjHGVGWjrzFy2Mg4NTZvHJQRvZUT3mQGC9FENveT8O05Fodf9VE9fqycphBlywle0W8xAWQJYzkNQ39WKATmuX585CADQeCKqm7npsBpzitmNCVjI1aE5TpgiVO2qks6OWVg0iBypUo/s1600/Title.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1508" data-original-width="1600" height="189" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh4uNBSGncpDuahU327woHMV6IbSTAfHghJt5sruliN1APCfR4xjwjHGVGWjrzFy2Mg4NTZvHJQRvZUT3mQGC9FENveT8O05Fodf9VE9fqycphBlywle0W8xAWQJYzkNQ39WKATmuX585CADQeCKqm7npsBpzitmNCVjI1aE5TpgiVO2qks6OWVg0iBypUo/w200-h189/Title.png" width="200" /></a>
While doing the research for a future talk, I came across an obscure but impressively prophetic report entitled <a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED368360"><i>Accessibility and Integrity of Networked Information Collections</i></a> that Cliff Lynch wrote for the federal Office of Technology Assessment in 1993, 32 years ago. I say "obscure" because it doesn't appear in Lynch's <a href="https://www.cni.org/about-cni/staff/clifford-a-lynch/publications/lynch-pubs-pre97">pre-1997 bibliography</a>.<br />
<br />
To give you some idea of the context in which it was written, unless you are over 70, it was more than half your life ago when in November 1989 Tim Berners-Lee's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">browser first accessed a page from his Web server</a>. It was only about the same time that the first commercial, as opposed to research, Internet Service Providers started with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Internet">ARPANET being decommissioned</a> the next year.  Two years later, in December of 1991, the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center put up the <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/11/first-us-web-page.html">first US Web page</a>. In 1992 Tim Berners-Lee <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/HTRESP.html">codified and extended the HTTP protocol</a> he had earlier implemented.  It would be another two years before Netscape became the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=dR2G0oPufe0C&lpg=PA69&ots=UnIlNi_km1&dq=netscape%20SSL%201.0&pg=PA69#v=onepage&q=netscape%20SSL%201.0&f=false">first browser to support HTTPS</a>.  It would be two years after that before the ITEF approved HTTP/1.0 in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1945">RFC 1945</a>. As you can see, Lynch was writing among the birth-pangs of the Web.<br />
<br />
Although Lynch was insufficiently pessimistic, he got a lot of things exactly right. Below the fold I provide four out of many examples.<br />

When discussing the "strong bias in the Internet user community to prefer free information sources" he was, alas, prescient although it took more than "a few years":<br />
<blockquote>
The ultimate result a few years hence &mdash; <i>and it may not be a bad or inappropriate response, given the reality of the situation</i> &mdash; may be a perception of the Internet and much of the information accessible through it as the "net of a million lies", following science fiction author Vernor Vinge's vision of an interstellar information network characterized by the continual release of information (which may or may not be true, and where the reader often has no means of telling whether the information is accurate) by a variety of organizations for obscure and sometimes evil reasons.
</blockquote>
The Vernor Vinge reference is to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep"><i>A Fire Upon the Deep</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In the novel, the Net is depicted as working much like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">Usenet</a> network in the early 1990s, with transcripts of messages containing header and footer information as one would find in such forums.
</blockquote>
The downsides of a social medium to which anyone can post without moderation were familiar to anyone who was online in the days of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">Usenet</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Usenet is culturally and historically significant in the networked world, having given rise to, or popularized, many widely recognized concepts and terms such as "FAQ", "flame", sockpuppet, and "spam".<br />
...<br />
Likewise, many conflicts which later spread to the rest of the Internet, such as the ongoing difficulties over spamming, began on Usenet.:<br />
<blockquote>
"Usenet is like a herd of performing elephants with diarrhea. Massive, difficult to redirect, awe-inspiring, entertaining, and a source of mind-boggling amounts of excrement when you least expect it."<br />
<br />
— Gene Spafford, 1992
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
Earlier in the report Lynch had written (Page 23):<br />
<blockquote>
Access to electronic information is of questionable value if the integrity of that information is seriously compromised; indeed, access to inaccurate information, or even deliberate misinformation, may be worse than no access at all, particularly for the naive user who is not inclined to question the information that the new electronic infrastructure is offering.
</blockquote>
This resonates as the wildfires rage in Los Angeles.<br />
<h3><a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/918590403">Information Doesn't Want To Be Free</a></h3>
Although Tim Berners-Lee's initial HTTP specification included the status code <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/HTRESP.html"><b>402 Payment Required</b></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The parameter to this message gives a specification of charging schemes acceptable. The client may retry the request with a suitable ChargeTo header.
</blockquote>
the Web in 1993 lacked paywalls. But Lynch could see them coming (Page 22):<br />
<blockquote>
There is a tendency to incorrectly equate access to the network with access to information; part of this is a legacy from the early focus on communications infrastructure rather than network content. Another part is the fact that traditionally the vast bulk of information on the Internet has been publicly accessible if one could simply obtain access to the Internet itself, figure out how to use it, and figure out where to locate the information you wanted. As proprietary information becomes accessible on the Internet on a large scale, this will change drastically. In my view, access to the network will become commonplace over the next decade or so, much as access to the public switched telephone network is relatively ubiquitous today. But in the new "information age" information will not necessarily be readily accessible or affordable;
</blockquote>
The current <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110">RFC 9110</a> states:<br />
<blockquote>
The 402 (Payment Required) status code is reserved for future use.
</blockquote>
Instead today's Web is infested with paywalls, each with their own idiosyncratic user interface, infrastructure, and risks.<br />
<h3>The Death Of "First Sale"</h3>
Lynch understood the highly consequential nature of the change in the business model of paid information access from <i>purchasing</i> a copy to <i>renting</i> access to the publisher's copy; from a legal framework of copyright and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-sale_doctrine">"first sale" doctrine</a>, to one of copyright and contract law (Page 30):<br />
<blockquote>
Now, consider a library acquiring information in an electronic format. Such information is almost never, today, sold to a library (under the doctrine of first sale); rather, it is licensed to the library that acquires it, with the terms under which the acquiring library can utilize the information defined by a contract typically far more restrictive than copyright law. The licensing contract typically includes statements that define the user community permitted to utilize the electronic information as well as terms that define the specific uses that this user community may make of the licensed electronic information.  These terms typically do not reflect any consideration of public policy decisions such as fair use, and in fact the licensing organization may well be liable for what its patrons do with the licensed information.
</blockquote>
The power imbalance between publishers and their customers is of long standing, and it especially affects the academic literature. In 1989 the Association of Research Libraries published <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=xuXgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA39-IA19&amp;lpg=PA39-IA19&amp;dq=chuck+hammicker+serials+pricing+crisis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9ZMEXp73DG&amp;sig=n4WexMPTa5kqWbilLv-WJoX959g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiw07nvot3aAhXqh1QKHdInDu8Q6AEIXTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20sun%22&amp;f=false"><i>Report of the ARL Serials Prices Project</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
The ARL Serials Initiative forms part of a special campaign mounted by librarians in the 1980s against the high cost of serials subscriptions. This is not the first time that libraries have suffered from high serial prices. For example, in 1927 the Association of American Universities reported that:<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
"Librarians are suffering because of the increasing volume of publications and rapidly rising prices. Of special concern is the much larger number of periodicals that are available and that members of the faculty consider essential to the successful conduct of their work. Many instances were found in which science departments were obligated to use all of their allotment for library purposes to purchase their periodical literature which was regarded as necessary for the work of the department"
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
The oligopoly rents extracted by academic publishers have been a problem for close on a century, if not longer! Lynch's analysis of the effects of the Web's amplification of this power imbalance is wide-ranging, including (Page 31):<br />
<blockquote>
Very few contracts with publishers today are perpetual licenses; rather, they are licenses for a fixed period of time, with terms subject to renegotiation when that time period expires. Libraries typically have no controls on price increase when the license is renewed; thus, rather than considering a traditional collection development decision about whether to renew a given subscription in light of recent price increases, they face the decision as to whether to lose all existing material that is part of the subscription as well as future material if they choose not to commit funds to cover the publisher's price increase at renewal time.
</blockquote>
Thus destroying libraries' traditional role as stewards of information for future readers. And (Page 30):<br />
<blockquote>
Of equal importance, the contracts typically do not recognize activities such as interlibrary loan, and prohibit the library licensing the information from making it available outside of that library's immediate user community.  This destroys the current cost-sharing structure that has been put in place among libraries through the existing interlibrary loan system, and makes each library (or, perhaps, the patrons of that library) responsible for the acquisitions cost of any material that is to be supplied to those patrons in electronic form.  The implications of this shift from copyright law and the doctrine of first sale to contract law (and very restrictive contract terms) is potentially devastating to the library community and to the ability of library patrons to obtain access to electronic information &mdash; in particular, it dissolves the historical linkage by which public libraries can provide access to information that is primarily held by research libraries to individuals desiring access to this information.  There is also a great irony in the move to licensing in the context of computer communications networks &mdash; while these networks promise to largely eliminate the accidents of geography as an organizing principle for inter-institutional cooperation and to usher in a new era of cooperation among geographically dispersed organizations, the shift to licensing essentially means that each library contracting with a publisher or other information provider becomes as isolated, insular organization that cannot share its resources with any other organization on the network.
</blockquote>
<h3>Surveillance Capitalism</h3>
Lynch also foresaw the start of "surveillance capitalism" (Page 60):<br />
<blockquote>
we are now seeing considerable use of multi-source data fusion: the matching and aggregation of credit, consumer, employment, medical and other data about individuals. I expect that we will recapitulate the development of these secondary markets in customer behavior histories for information seeking in the 1990s; we will also see information-seeking consumer histories integrated with a wide range of other sources of data on individual behavior.<br />
<br />
The ability to accurately, cheaply and easily count the amount of use that an electronic information resource receives (file accesses, database queries, viewings of a document, etc.) coupled with the ability to frequently alter prices in a computer-based marketplace (particularly in acquire on demand systems that operate on small units of information such as journal articles or database records, but even, to a lesser extent, by renegotiating license agreements annually) may give rise to a number of radical changes. These potentials are threatening for all involved.
</blockquote>
He described search-based advertising (Page 61)<br />
<blockquote>
The ability to collect not only information on what is being sought out or used but also who is doing the seeking or using is potentially very valuable information that could readily be resold, since it can be used both for market analysis (who is buying what) and also for directed marketing (people who fit a certain interest profile, as defined by their information access decisions, would likely also be interested in new product X or special offer Y). While such usage (without the informed consent of the recipient of the advertising) may well offend strong advocates of privacy, in many cases the consumers are actually quite grateful to hear of new products that closely match their interests.  And libraries and similar institutions, strapped for revenue, may have to recognize that usage data can be a valuable potential revenue source, no matter how unattractive they find collecting, repackaging and reselling this information.
</blockquote>
Of course, it wasn't the libraries but Google, spawned from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Digital_Library_Project">Stanford Digital Library Project</a>, which ended up collecting the information and monetizing it. And the power imbalance between publishers and readers meant that the reality of tracking was hidden (Page 63):<br />
<blockquote>
when one is accessing (anonymously or otherwise) a public-access information service, it is unclear what to expect, and in fact at present there is no way to even learn what the policy of the information service provider is.
</blockquote>

We had a <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">standard</a> long before Bluesky came along, isn't it wrong for them to try to force everyone to use their reinvention?

It is somehow fitting that President Joe Biden&#8217;s farewell address to the nation, scheduled for 8:00 Eastern time tonight, was overshadowed today by the dramatic announcement that after months of negotiation backed by the United States and facilitated by Egyptian and Qatari mediators, negotiators from Israel and Hamas have agreed to a ceasefire and to exchange Israeli hostages taken on October 7, 2023, for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.

## Top 10 ways to monitor Linux in the console

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Top 10 ways to monitor Linux in the console</span>

            <p></p>

<p><code>top</code> (pictured <em>below</em>... above is <a href="#btop">btop</a>) is the first utility everyone recommends to monitor Linux (or any form of UNIX, including macOS) resource usage. It's efficient, available almost everywhere... but it's also a bit basic. It shows essential metrics, but looks like it's from the 80s. There are ways to brighten it up, like highlighting active processes or changing color schemes, but it's not the only game in town!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Nowadays, there are a <em>lot</em> of modern monitoring tools—and some not so modern, but immensely useful—to choose from. This blog post will run through some of the ones I rely on most often. Let me know in the comments if you use any others I didn't cover!</p>

## Making "this" less annoying

date: 2025-01-15, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>Now that I have a job where I’m writing web components full time, I see the <code>this</code> keyword more than I ever have in my whole life. It’s not a problem, per se, but you can see how it’s a little repetitive. I started wondering what my options were to fix this minor annoyance and the ShopTalk Discord helped me find a simple way and an over-the-top way to fix my issue.</p>
<h2>Simple way: Overriding VS Code theme color tokens</h2>
<p>By default my Github Light theme makes <code>this</code> a bold dark blue color. I didn’t want to roll my own theme though to scratch this niche itch, so I dug in and found out you can override single tokens in VS Code. Handy. The documentation is a bit opaque but here’s what you need to do:</p>
<div class="language-jsx highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="jsx"><span class="c1">// settings.json</span>
<span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">editor.tokenColorCustomizations</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">textMateRules</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">scope</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">variable.language.this</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">settings</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">foreground</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">#b0b0b0</span><span class="dl">"</span>
      <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">},</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now my <code>this</code> looks like this…</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/dimmed.jpg" alt="the keyword this in code set in a light gray, almost illegible font color" /></p>
<p>It’s a calming sensation for me to have repetitive noise dimmed. I liked it so much I dimmed comments to match as well. I may even dim TypeScript because sometimes I wish I could hide the syntax, but keep the squiggles.</p>
<h2>Over the top way: Replace <code>this</code> with a custom glyph</h2>
<p>Changing colors is cool… but what if you could go one step further and replace <code>this</code> with an icon? What would an icon for <code>this</code> even look like?</p>
<p>I asked the ShopTalk Discord and got some interesting ideas like the “☝️” emoji, which I think is funny in an “I’m with stupid” t-shirt sort of way. <a href="https://andrewwalpole.com/">Andrew Walpole</a> took it to the next level and <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/i/sticker/This-Logo-Yellow-by-walpolea/162159874.EJUG5">designed a custom glyph</a>:</p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/this.png" alt="the letter of the word this arranged in a diamond pattern" width="150" height="152">
<p><a href="https://www.alanwsmith.com/">Alan Smith</a> then figured out <a href="https://youtu.be/x1heJdtQapI">how to use Glyphs Mini to add a custom ligature to an open source coding font</a>. Andrew riffed on Alan’s work and exported a custom version of Fira Code with his custom glyph as a ligature. The last step was to install the font update my VS Code settings:</p>
<div class="language-jsx highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="jsx">  <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">editor.fontFamily</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">'Fira Code Ligged', monospace</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">editor.fontLigatures</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now my code looks incredibly futuristic…</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/glyph.jpg" alt="the this glyph replacing instances of the glyph keyword in code" /></p>
<p>Abusing typefaces to remove the repetitiveness of programming languages is fun. After seeing the icon <em>in situ</em>, the idea might be a smidge too wild for me due to reduced legibility. While I don’t use the custom glyph on the daily, this experiment does spark a deep desire in me to create a bunch of custom glyphs for common keywords so I can make JavaScript an entirely rune-based programming language.</p>
<h2>Custom ligatures with CSS?</h2>
<p>A wild idea, but it would be neat if you could create your own custom ligatures in CSS to avoid the need to re-bake custom fonts each time you have a niche typographic need. Here’s a pseudo-syntax of how that might work:</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="k">@font-face</span> <span class="s1">"Dave Hijinks"</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">match</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">"this."</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">replace</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">"☝️."</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">@font-face</span> <span class="s1">"Cloud2Butts"</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">match</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">"cloud"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">"AI"</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">replace</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">"butt"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="sx">url(fart.svg)</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nt">body</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">font-face</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">"Dave Hijinks"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">"Cloud2Butt"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">sans-serif</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Anyways, it’s a thought. Not a serious proposal. This was a fun rabbit hole to travel down with some friends.</p>

Perhaps, even though they are not themselves explainable, AIs can help us engineer explainable systems. But I’m not optimistic.

## Can AI reinvent biology?

date: 2025-01-14, from: Om Malik blog

A new season of&#160;CrazyStupidTech has&#160;begun,&#160;with my&#160;co-writer&#160;Fred Vogelstein&#160;turning his attention&#160;to&#160;a new company from one of the fathers of modern artificial intelligence.&#160; Generative AI has dominated recent discourse, but the impact of artificial intelligence extends far beyond consumer applications. Take Inceptive, for example. The startup, co-founded by Jakob Uszkoreit (co-author of the seminal Transformer paper) and Stanford biochemist Rhiju Das, marries AI and biology to create “biological software.” It is &#8230;

## An internet of ideas

date: 2025-01-14, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I used to use Twitter for middle of the night ideas. These days I use one of Twitter's successors.   </p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lfowjw3z6k2d">Here's one</a>. "We should be able to tweet from within any application that has the ability to create and edit text, and not just in tiny little text boxes." <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lfowjw4jrs2d">And another</a>. "The limits imposed by twitter initially in 2006 resulted in there being room for only very simple ideas. </p>
<p>Self-contained isolated silos make progress impossible. We need an internet of ideas. Why should we depend on one small vulnerable company to handle all our internet publishing? It’s an old outdated idea. Look where our investment in Twitter left us, nomads searching for a new home, and what did we do, we went for basically the same deal as before. Oy. </p>
<p>Re silos, are you watching the Apple TV+ series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silo_(TV_series)">Silo</a>? I don't want to spoil it, but their idea of a silo is more less exactly what we're talking about with the silos or semi-silos of the twitter-like era. They know being a silo is not popular so they do little things to give you reason to believe they might not be a silo. But being a partial silo is like being partially pregnant. No such thing. If you're federated that means you peer with your competitors. Facebook, or whatever you call Mark Xuckerberg's company these days, just <a href="https://www.404media.co/meta-is-blocking-links-to-decentralized-instagram-competitor-pixelfed/">cut off</a> an Instagram competitor and completely gave away that federation is a very conditional thing for them, even if a user of Instagram might also want to hook into flow from <a href="https://pixelfed.org/">Pixelfed</a>. I never believed in their support of the fediverse. Now let's get some reality into these discussions. </p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lfoxxs7gy22x">On Unix</a>. "Learning Unix was when I learned that computer networks could be simple yet infinitely powerful. Before that for me it was just an inkling, a hunch. Reading the source code I wanted to make software that works like that. I hope I have, to some extent."</p>
<p>On <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg">Matt Mullenweg</a>, who surprisingly has become a polarizing figure in the tech world. Who could've seen that coming? Not me. "<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lfoxsh7nd22x">Radical idea</a>. Matt Mullenweg doesn’t like how things are going. He has every right to try to change it, to make it right. As do you, and I." I don't like that people have called him things like the Mad King. People used to say stuff like that about me. It's a substitute for trying to understand where someone is coming from. One of the things I learned about creating open technology is you attract people who don't contribute anything but expect you to work for them, for you to take orders from them. That is really what it comes down to, and it's crazy. If you feel strongly about something, either learn how to program, or make your freaking case with some humility, or offer a bounty, or just trust the universe. But giving people orders, there's no place for that. Matt could be right or wrong, or he could be right for himself. But he has the right to control his own destiny, as you and I do, to the extent that we can. </p>
<p>I have my own vision for WordPress, as I've started to talk about here and Murphy-willing you should see more of that in the coming weeks. If you want a clue, listen to my <a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/01/08/howIViewWordpress.html">podcast</a> from January 8, and then if you have questions, <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/316">ask them here</a>. I think it's a better bet that WordPress will be the backbone of the social web than any of the other candidates. I wouldn't mind being wrong, as long as we can peer with the eventual winner. I can't endorse a silo, even on the hope that it will be de-silo'd. I also don't believe in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_fairy">Tooth Fairy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg">Glinda</a> the good witch of the south. </p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/11/15/fatladysinging.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">One more thing. In the middle of the night the Department of Justice released <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25486139-report-of-special-counsel-smith-volume-1-january-2025/">half of the report</a> on their case against president-elect Trump, a much anticipated bit of news. I didn't know it had been released, but when I woke up, and made the usual rounds, I checked in on Bluesky, Threads, Mastodon, Facebook and then finally Twitter, in that order. Guess where I discovered this news. Twitter. So when you think people move when they don't like what Musk does, or they find that Twitter is as polluted as some of the celebs do, understand this -- most people aren't affected by the noise. I don't see it unless I go look for it. Perhaps this is because I've been very liberal with blocking abusers, or more likely I don't have <a href="https://x.com/davewiner">enough followers</a> to be an attractive target for the abusers, who behave like spammers. They post where the flow is, and my account isn't as attractive as (for example) Paul Krugman, Mark Cuban or Jay Rosen. It takes a lot to get people to move, and I suspect most people never will. If you operate a gasoline powered car, I bet you buy a lot of Exxon gas, even if you don't see their logo when you fill up. It's very hard to get away from companies who hurt our species, by design, unfortunately. </p>

## The First Password on the Internet

date: 2025-01-14, updated: 2025-01-13, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>It was <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-britain-got-its-first-internet-connection-by-the-late-pioneer-who-created-the-first-password-on-the-internet-45404">created</a> in 1973 by Peter Kirstein:</p>
<blockquote><p>So from the beginning I put password protection on my gateway. This had been done in such a way that even if UK users telephoned directly into the communications computer provided by Darpa in UCL, they would require a password.</p>
<p>In fact this was the first password on Arpanet. It proved invaluable in satisfying authorities on both sides of the Atlantic for the 15 years I ran the service ­ during which no security breach occurred over my link. I also put in place a system of governance that any UK users had to be approved by a committee which I chaired but which also had UK government and British Post Office representation...</p></blockquote>

In May 2024 we finally decided that maybe the time has come for curl to drop support of older TLS libraries.

## On Neil Gaiman and sexual abuse

date: 2025-01-14, from: Jessica Smith's blog

<p>I will not be seeking out or reading that article that came out today, because I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d find it too triggering. Besides, some revelations already came out months ago, and I read those, and I&rsquo;m gonna assume the latest ones are more of the same (maybe worse).</p>
<p>Look, I was also abused by a self-proclaimed &ldquo;male feminist&rdquo; when I was younger, and the audacity of these men makes me really angry. It&rsquo;s like they get off on the contradiction, on lying through their teeth and having the wider world lap it all up while the victim just quietly seethes. And maybe also because the lie makes it easier to attract more naïve victims, I don&rsquo;t know. I really try not to let my bitterness overcome me, and not <em>always</em> assume the worst of men who remind me of him, but then periodically there are these reveals and I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;Oh, guess I should have listened to my instincts all along.&rdquo; I mean, I know we&rsquo;re talking about some random celebrity I&rsquo;m never gonna meet whose work I never really liked, but still. Gaiman can go to hell, and so can every other perpetrator of abuse, but <em>especially</em> the slimy ones with these charismatic, &ldquo;anti-sexist&rdquo; personas. There is a <em>special</em> level of hell for you.</p>

## What I want and am not getting from AI technology

date: 2025-01-13, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>There’s a funny contradiction in the AI world.</p>
<ol>
<li>News orgs, published authors, great artists, universities, want to retain ownership of their intellectual property and don’t trust the utility of AI chatbots. They think the only application of AI technology is to steal from them, to cheat at school and in work. They see AI technology as destructive, immoral and dishonest.</li>
<li>As a writer, of prose and software, I want to use the new tools to analyze and develop my work. I want ChatGpt to help port my biggest piece of software from Mac to Linux where it will work far better, far into the future. I want it to reassemble my 30+ years of every day writing into something that can be read by anyone in a few days. I want it to organize new writing projects in ways I can’t. I want it to help me learn about myself. I would gladly give it access to all my creative work, if only there were a relatively easy way to do it. Rather than demanding money, I would gladly pay thousands of dollars to have it all absorbed into its models so I can study and learn.</li>
</ol>
<p>Two very different approaches to the same technology.</p>

## Microsoft Takes Legal Action Against AI “Hacking as a Service” Scheme

<blockquote><p>Microsoft is accusing three individuals of running a &#8220;hacking-as-a-service&#8221; scheme that was designed to allow the creation of harmful and illicit content using the company&#8217;s platform for AI-generated content.</p>

## 2025-01-12 Disk space

date: 2025-01-12, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-01-12-disk-space">2025-01-12 Disk space</h1>

<p>It&rsquo;s that time of the year again. How to get back disk space?</p>

<p>Open the Files application and empty the trash. (How to do this from the command line?)</p>

<p>Delete the cache for Debian packages:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get clean
</code></pre>

<p>Check out local caches:</p>

<pre><code>ncdu .cache/
</code></pre>

<p>Python stuff:</p>

<pre><code>pip cache purge
</code></pre>

<p>Also, feel free to delete other stuff in there. I just deleted a &ldquo;whisper&rdquo; directory containing a language model I didn&rsquo;t need and a &ldquo;tracker3&rdquo; directory containing data for the Gnome miner, I think. Also &ldquo;chromium&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s not my main browser. I don&rsquo;t care about its cache.</p>

<p>Perlbrew stuff. Find out what Perls you have installed.</p>

<pre><code>perlbrew list
</code></pre>

<p>You aren&rsquo;t going to need them:</p>

<pre><code>perlbrew uninstall perl-5.30.0
perlbrew uninstall perl-5.32.0
</code></pre>

<p>Go build cache:</p>

<pre><code>go clean -cache
</code></pre>

in Honolulu, Seoul, Vietnam, Berlin, Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and other

## Is Bluesky federated like Masto?

date: 2025-01-12, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>This is one of the dialogs you encounter when getting started with Bluesky. It's easy to see how new users might be led believe that Bluesky is federated, as Mastodon is. I'm a developer and I was confused by what it was saying.</p>

## Giving up the pretense

date: 2025-01-12, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

Ryan Broderick at Garbage Day says content moderation died on January 6, 2021: [T]he Insurrection was the first time Americans could truly see the radicalizing effects of algorithmic platforms like Facebook and YouTube that other parts of the world, particularly the Global South, had dealt with for years.

<p>The basic definition of terrorism is &ldquo;violence designed to create terror in a civilian population to achieve a political aim&rdquo;. Clearly, not only are states <em>capable</em> of carrying out terrorism, they are by far the primary perpetrators of terrorism in the world. But the UN, being made up of nation-states, has always resisted having a definition of terrorism that acknowledged that, instead including clauses like &ldquo;…by non-nation-state actors&rdquo;. In this way, for example, Israel is &ldquo;not a terrorist state&rdquo;, while the Palestinians defending themselves <em>are</em> terrorists…</p>
<p>And then we reach the modern era, where acts not designed to instill terror in a civilian population at all, like the United Healthcare shooting, get branded as &ldquo;terrorism&rdquo;. Like, according to the ruling class, it&rsquo;s now just terrorism if the ruling class is afraid. No naked self-interest in that at all 🙄</p>
