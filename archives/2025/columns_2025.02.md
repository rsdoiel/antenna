## New version of Daytona

date: 2025-01-15, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Daytona is the search engine for Scripting News.  </p>
<p>I've wanted to do a rewrite for quite some time, there were a lot of decisions I wanted to redo, and I've learned a lot about databases in the <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/">three years</a> since the first release.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/">try it out</a>. There are <a href="https://this.how/daytona/">docs</a>, and a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/317">place</a> for questions and comments. The usual caveats apply, esp since it's newly deployed, quickly.</p>

## Making "this" less annoying

date: 2025-01-15, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>Now that I have a job where I‚Äôm writing web components full time, I see the <code>this</code> keyword more than I ever have in my whole life. It‚Äôs not a problem, per se, but you can see how it‚Äôs a little repetitive. I started wondering what my options were to fix this minor annoyance and the ShopTalk Discord helped me find a simple way and an over-the-top way to fix my issue.</p>
<h2>Simple way: Overriding VS Code theme color tokens</h2>
<p>By default my Github Light theme makes <code>this</code> a bold dark blue color. I didn‚Äôt want to roll my own theme though to scratch this niche itch, so I dug in and found out you can override single tokens in VS Code. Handy. The documentation is a bit opaque but here‚Äôs what you need to do:</p>
<div class="language-jsx highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="jsx"><span class="c1">// settings.json</span>
<span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">editor.tokenColorCustomizations</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">textMateRules</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">scope</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">variable.language.this</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">settings</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">foreground</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">#b0b0b0</span><span class="dl">"</span>
      <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">},</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now my <code>this</code> looks like this‚Ä¶</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/dimmed.jpg" alt="the keyword this in code set in a light gray, almost illegible font color" /></p>
<p>It‚Äôs a calming sensation for me to have repetitive noise dimmed. I liked it so much I dimmed comments to match as well. I may even dim TypeScript because sometimes I wish I could hide the syntax, but keep the squiggles.</p>
<h2>Over the top way: Replace <code>this</code> with a custom glyph</h2>
<p>Changing colors is cool‚Ä¶ but what if you could go one step further and replace <code>this</code> with an icon? What would an icon for <code>this</code> even look like?</p>
<p>I asked the ShopTalk Discord and got some interesting ideas like the ‚Äú‚òùÔ∏è‚Äù emoji, which I think is funny in an ‚ÄúI‚Äôm with stupid‚Äù t-shirt sort of way. <a href="https://andrewwalpole.com/">Andrew Walpole</a> took it to the next level and <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/i/sticker/This-Logo-Yellow-by-walpolea/162159874.EJUG5">designed a custom glyph</a>:</p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/this.png" alt="the letter of the word this arranged in a diamond pattern" width="150" height="152">
<p><a href="https://www.alanwsmith.com/">Alan Smith</a> then figured out <a href="https://youtu.be/x1heJdtQapI">how to use Glyphs Mini to add a custom ligature to an open source coding font</a>. Andrew riffed on Alan‚Äôs work and exported a custom version of Fira Code with his custom glyph as a ligature. The last step was to install the font update my VS Code settings:</p>
<div class="language-jsx highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="jsx">  <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">editor.fontFamily</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">'Fira Code Ligged', monospace</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">editor.fontLigatures</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now my code looks incredibly futuristic‚Ä¶</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/glyph.jpg" alt="the this glyph replacing instances of the glyph keyword in code" /></p>
<p>Abusing typefaces to remove the repetitiveness of programming languages is fun. After seeing the icon <em>in situ</em>, the idea might be a smidge too wild for me due to reduced legibility. While I don‚Äôt use the custom glyph on the daily, this experiment does spark a deep desire in me to create a bunch of custom glyphs for common keywords so I can make JavaScript an entirely rune-based programming language.</p>
<h2>Custom ligatures with CSS?</h2>
<p>A wild idea, but it would be neat if you could create your own custom ligatures in CSS to avoid the need to re-bake custom fonts each time you have a niche typographic need. Here‚Äôs a pseudo-syntax of how that might work:</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="k">@font-face</span> <span class="s1">"Dave Hijinks"</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">match</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">"this."</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">replace</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">"‚òùÔ∏è."</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">@font-face</span> <span class="s1">"Cloud2Butts"</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">match</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">"cloud"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">"AI"</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="py">replace</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">"butt"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="sx">url(fart.svg)</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nt">body</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="py">font-face</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">"Dave Hijinks"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">"Cloud2Butt"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">sans-serif</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Anyways, it‚Äôs a thought. Not a serious proposal. This was a fun rabbit hole to travel down with some friends.</p>

## The Configuration Crisis

Perhaps, even though they are not themselves explainable, AIs can help us engineer explainable systems. But I‚Äôm not optimistic. It feels like we‚Äôre on a path to keep making systems harder for humans to configure, and we keep expanding our reliance on superhuman intelligence to do that for us.

## An internet of ideas

date: 2025-01-14, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I used to use Twitter for middle of the night ideas. These days I use one of Twitter's successors.   </p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lfowjw3z6k2d">Here's one</a>. "We should be able to tweet from within any application that has the ability to create and edit text, and not just in tiny little text boxes." <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lfowjw4jrs2d">And another</a>. "The limits imposed by twitter initially in 2006 resulted in there being room for only very simple ideas. </p>
<p>Self-contained isolated silos make progress impossible. We need an internet of ideas. Why should we depend on one small vulnerable company to handle all our internet publishing? It‚Äôs an old outdated idea. Look where our investment in Twitter left us, nomads searching for a new home, and what did we do, we went for basically the same deal as before. Oy. </p>
<p>Re silos, are you watching the Apple TV+ series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silo_(TV_series)">Silo</a>? I don't want to spoil it, but their idea of a silo is more less exactly what we're talking about with the silos or semi-silos of the twitter-like era. They know being a silo is not popular so they do little things to give you reason to believe they might not be a silo. But being a partial silo is like being partially pregnant. No such thing. If you're federated that means you peer with your competitors. Facebook, or whatever you call Mark Xuckerberg's company these days, just <a href="https://www.404media.co/meta-is-blocking-links-to-decentralized-instagram-competitor-pixelfed/">cut off</a> an Instagram competitor and completely gave away that federation is a very conditional thing for them, even if a user of Instagram might also want to hook into flow from <a href="https://pixelfed.org/">Pixelfed</a>. I never believed in their support of the fediverse. Now let's get some reality into these discussions. </p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lfoxxs7gy22x">On Unix</a>. "Learning Unix was when I learned that computer networks could be simple yet infinitely powerful. Before that for me it was just an inkling, a hunch. Reading the source code I wanted to make software that works like that. I hope I have, to some extent."</p>
<p>On <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg">Matt Mullenweg</a>, who surprisingly has become a polarizing figure in the tech world. Who could've seen that coming? Not me. "<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lfoxsh7nd22x">Radical idea</a>. Matt Mullenweg doesn‚Äôt like how things are going. He has every right to try to change it, to make it right. As do you, and I." I don't like that people have called him things like the Mad King. People used to say stuff like that about me. It's a substitute for trying to understand where someone is coming from. One of the things I learned about creating open technology is you attract people who don't contribute anything but expect you to work for them, for you to take orders from them. That is really what it comes down to, and it's crazy. If you feel strongly about something, either learn how to program, or make your freaking case with some humility, or offer a bounty, or just trust the universe. But giving people orders, there's no place for that. Matt could be right or wrong, or he could be right for himself. But he has the right to control his own destiny, as you and I do, to the extent that we can. </p>
<p>I have my own vision for WordPress, as I've started to talk about here and Murphy-willing you should see more of that in the coming weeks. If you want a clue, listen to my <a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/01/08/howIViewWordpress.html">podcast</a> from January 8, and then if you have questions, <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/316">ask them here</a>. I think it's a better bet that WordPress will be the backbone of the social web than any of the other candidates. I wouldn't mind being wrong, as long as we can peer with the eventual winner. I can't endorse a silo, even on the hope that it will be de-silo'd. I also don't believe in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_fairy">Tooth Fairy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg">Glinda</a> the good witch of the south. </p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/11/15/fatladysinging.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">One more thing. In the middle of the night the Department of Justice released <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25486139-report-of-special-counsel-smith-volume-1-january-2025/">half of the report</a> on their case against president-elect Trump, a much anticipated bit of news. I didn't know it had been released, but when I woke up, and made the usual rounds, I checked in on Bluesky, Threads, Mastodon, Facebook and then finally Twitter, in that order. Guess where I discovered this news. Twitter. So when you think people move when they don't like what Musk does, or they find that Twitter is as polluted as some of the celebs do, understand this -- most people aren't affected by the noise. I don't see it unless I go look for it. Perhaps this is because I've been very liberal with blocking abusers, or more likely I don't have <a href="https://x.com/davewiner">enough followers</a> to be an attractive target for the abusers, who behave like spammers. They post where the flow is, and my account isn't as attractive as (for example) Paul Krugman, Mark Cuban or Jay Rosen. It takes a lot to get people to move, and I suspect most people never will. If you operate a gasoline powered car, I bet you buy a lot of Exxon gas, even if you don't see their logo when you fill up. It's very hard to get away from companies who hurt our species, by design, unfortunately. </p>

## The First Password on the Internet

date: 2025-01-14, updated: 2025-01-13, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>It was <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-britain-got-its-first-internet-connection-by-the-late-pioneer-who-created-the-first-password-on-the-internet-45404">created</a> in 1973 by Peter Kirstein:</p>
<blockquote><p>So from the beginning I put password protection on my gateway. This had been done in such a way that even if UK users telephoned directly into the communications computer provided by Darpa in UCL, they would require a password.</p>
<p>In fact this was the first password on Arpanet. It proved invaluable in satisfying authorities on both sides of the Atlantic for the 15 years I ran the service ¬≠ during which no security breach occurred over my link. I also put in place a system of governance that any UK users had to be approved by a committee which I chaired but which also had UK government and British Post Office representation...</p></blockquote>

## Secure Transport support in curl is on its way out

date: 2025-01-14, from: Daniel Stenberg Blog

In May 2024 we finally decided that maybe the time has come for curl to drop support of older TLS libraries. Libraries that because they don&#8217;t support the modern TLS version (1.3) for many users are maybe not suitable to build upon for the future. We gave the world 12 months to adapt or to &#8230; <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/01/14/secure-transport-support-in-curl-is-on-its-way-out/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Secure Transport support in curl is on its way out</span> <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>

## What I want and am not getting from AI technology

date: 2025-01-13, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>There‚Äôs a funny contradiction in the AI world.</p>
<ol>
<li>News orgs, published authors, great artists, universities, want to retain ownership of their intellectual property and don‚Äôt trust the utility of AI chatbots. They think the only application of AI technology is to steal from them, to cheat at school and in work. They see AI technology as destructive, immoral and dishonest.</li>
<li>As a writer, of prose and software, I want to use the new tools to analyze and develop my work. I want ChatGpt to help port my biggest piece of software from Mac to Linux where it will work far better, far into the future. I want it to reassemble my 30+ years of every day writing into something that can be read by anyone in a few days. I want it to organize new writing projects in ways I can‚Äôt. I want it to help me learn about myself. I would gladly give it access to all my creative work, if only there were a relatively easy way to do it. Rather than demanding money, I would gladly pay thousands of dollars to have it all absorbed into its models so I can study and learn.</li>
</ol>
<p>Two very different approaches to the same technology.</p>

## Microsoft Takes Legal Action Against AI ‚ÄúHacking as a Service‚Äù Scheme

<blockquote><p>Microsoft is accusing three individuals of running a &#8220;hacking-as-a-service&#8221; scheme that was designed to allow the creation of harmful and illicit content using the company&#8217;s platform for AI-generated content.</p>
<p>The foreign-based defendants developed tools specifically designed to bypass safety guardrails Microsoft has erected to prevent the creation of harmful content through its generative AI services, <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/01/10/taking-legal-action-to-protect-the-public-from-abusive-ai-generated-content/">said</a> Steven Masada, the assistant general counsel for Microsoft&#8217;s Digital Crimes Unit.

<p>It&rsquo;s that time of the year again. How to get back disk space?</p>

<p>Open the Files application and empty the trash. (How to do this from the command line?)</p>

<p>Delete the cache for Debian packages:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get clean
</code></pre>

<p>Check out local caches:</p>

<pre><code>ncdu .cache/
</code></pre>

<p>Python stuff:</p>

<pre><code>pip cache purge
</code></pre>

<p>Also, feel free to delete other stuff in there. I just deleted a &ldquo;whisper&rdquo; directory containing a language model I didn&rsquo;t need and a &ldquo;tracker3&rdquo; directory containing data for the Gnome miner, I think. Also &ldquo;chromium&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s not my main browser. I don&rsquo;t care about its cache.</p>

<p>Perlbrew stuff. Find out what Perls you have installed.</p>

<pre><code>perlbrew list
</code></pre>

<p>You aren&rsquo;t going to need them:</p>

<pre><code>perlbrew uninstall perl-5.30.0
perlbrew uninstall perl-5.32.0

<p>The basic definition of terrorism is &ldquo;violence designed to create terror in a civilian population to achieve a political aim&rdquo;. Clearly, not only are states <em>capable</em> of carrying out terrorism, they are by far the primary perpetrators of terrorism in the world. But the UN, being made up of nation-states, has always resisted having a definition of terrorism that acknowledged that, instead including clauses like &ldquo;‚Ä¶by non-nation-state actors&rdquo;. In this way, for example, Israel is &ldquo;not a terrorist state&rdquo;, while the Palestinians defending themselves <em>are</em> terrorists‚Ä¶</p>
<p>And then we reach the modern era, where acts not designed to instill terror in a civilian population at all, like the United Healthcare shooting, get branded as &ldquo;terrorism&rdquo;. Like, according to the ruling class, it&rsquo;s now just terrorism if the ruling class is afraid. No naked self-interest in that at all üôÑ</p>
