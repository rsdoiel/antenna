War Within’s first patch is a goblin paradise packed full of fun
details</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-25, updated: 2025-02-25, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>The War Within is a solid expansion so far, and Blizzard is preparing
for the first major patch, which will take players to the trade capital
of the goblins. The goblins have been part of Warcraft’s history since
the real-time strategy games, but we haven’t always had the time to
delve into their history or […]</p>

<p>At Polygon, we want to introduce you do at least one thing we think
you’d love every single day. With so many games, movies, shows, and and
internet-based quick bites (or “quibis”) out there to experience, we

<p>Two Point Museum does not care whether I have to make dinner or not.

<p>Logitech is giving its Powerplay lineup of wireless charging
accessories some much-needed juice with a follow-up to the Powerplay
mouse pad. The Logitech Powerplay 2 mouse pad is a less expensive, and
slimmer version of its original Powerplay mouse pad from 2017, and will

<p>Stephen King is not writing for Mike Flanagan’s anticipated Dark
Tower series, after all. “Contrary to the Internet (which usually is
never wrong), I am NOT writing for Mike Flanagan’s DARK TOWER,” the
author posted on Bluesky Monday afternoon. On Monday morning, IGN

<p>Practical Pockets is unusual as far as Avowed treasure maps go. This
Emerald Stair map is looking out from the treasure’s location, not
showing you where it is. Lucky for you, the location is within close
reach and has few enemies patrolling nearby (unlike the region’s
Painter’s Regret treasure map map). The reward at the […]</p>

<p>Painter’s Regret is one of the first treasure maps you can get in the
Emerald Stair region of Avowed — and potentially one of the more
dangerous quests there as well. The map itself is in a safe area, but
the treasure location is surrounded by a group high-level enemies. Your
reward is a trinket […]</p>

<p>After somehow both teasing it a month ago and shadow-dropping it
Monday alongside Annapurna Interactive’s 2025 showcase, Sayonara Wild
Hearts is now available on PlayStation 5. Granted, you’ve been able to

<p>A large beast covered in fur dives through a small, circular arena in

<p>Destiny 2 players recently discovered a bug introduced by the game’s
Heresy update earlier in February. The issue allowed three powerful

of Intent, the Edge of Concurrence, and the Edge of Action — as well as
some older swords to become playable across […]</p>

<p>Playing Marvel’s Hulk (or a Hulk-like) requires fearlessness. While
budget constraints demand a decent amount of time spent walking and
talking as humanoid Bruce Banner or Jennifer Walters or, most recently,
Thaddeus Ross in Captain America: Brave New World, at some point, the

<p>Shauna (Melanie Lynskey, as an adult) is not happy about the gold

scared she lives in the total shadow of […]</p>
