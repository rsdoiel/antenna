Hunter Wilds is so streamlined, it may have lost its soul</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, updated: 2025-02-21, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>A large beast covered in fur dives through a small, circular arena in
the Iceshard Cliffs, tendrils of segmented scales twisting away from its
body as it lunges forward and attempts to knock me off balance. I dive
between its legs, blades whirling, opening a wound on its exposed chest.
Instinctively I take advantage of […]</p>

Destiny 2 bug broke some class rules — but Bungie isn’t fixing it</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, updated: 2025-02-24, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Destiny 2 players recently discovered a bug introduced by the game’s
Heresy update earlier in February. The issue allowed three powerful
exotic glaive weapons that were intended to be class-specific — the Edge
of Intent, the Edge of Concurrence, and the Edge of Action — as well as
some older swords to become playable across […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-02-23, updated: 2025-02-21, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Playing Marvel’s Hulk (or a Hulk-like) requires fearlessness. While
budget constraints demand a decent amount of time spent walking and
talking as humanoid Bruce Banner or Jennifer Walters or, most recently,
Thaddeus Ross in Captain America: Brave New World, at some point, the
gamma radiation kicks in and the snarling begins.  No actor can look

<p>Shauna (Melanie Lynskey, as an adult) is not happy about the gold
necklace situation at the end of the latest Yellowjackets episode. 
Which is understandable. At the very least, it’s a token from her dead
best friend, someone she’s haunted by the mere thought of, and sometimes
scared she lives in the total shadow of […]</p>

sequel trilogy star Daisy Ridley has been experimenting with a wide
variety of genres. She’s starred in a dystopian sci-fi thriller, a
