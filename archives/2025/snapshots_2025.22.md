date: 2025-06-02, from: Libre News

Flatpak is stable and widely used, but it still has some pain points when used in certain environments or for certain ends. However, most of those drawbacks are being worked on, and fixes are planned.

<blockquote cite="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1kzzyb2/professor_at_the_end_of_2_years_of_struggling/"><p>My constant struggle is how to convince them that getting an education in the humanities is not about regurgitating ideas/knowledge that already exist. It‚Äôs about generating new knowledge, striving for creative insights, and having thoughts that haven‚Äôt been had before. I don‚Äôt want you to learn facts. I want you to think. To notice. To question. To reconsider. To challenge. Students don‚Äôt yet get that ChatGPT only rearranges preexisting ideas, whether they are accurate or not.</p>
<p>And even if the information was guaranteed to be accurate, they‚Äôre not learning anything by plugging a prompt in and turning in the resulting paper. They‚Äôve bypassed the entire process of learning.</p></blockquote>

## Episode 158 - INTERCAL RIDES AGAIN - Restoring a Lost Compiler

date: 2025-06-01, from: Advent of Computing

<p>In 1973 the world caught it's first glimpse of INTERCAL. It's a wild and wacky language, somewhere between comedy and cutting satire. But the compiler was never circulated. There would be later implementations, but that original compiler remained lost to time. That is, until now. This episode covers how the original source code was found, and my attempt to get it up and running.</p> <p>Get the source code for INTERCAL72 here: <a href= "https://github.com/rottytooth/INTERCAL72/">https://github.com/rottytooth/INTERCAL72/</a></p> <p>Read the original INTERCAL manual: <a href= "https://3e8.org/pub/intercal.pdf">https://3e8.org/pub/intercal.pdf</a></p>

## Progressive JSON

date: 2025-06-01, updated: 2025-06-01, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://overreacted.io/progressive-json/">Progressive JSON</a></strong></p>
This post by Dan Abramov is a trap! It proposes a fascinating way of streaming JSON objects to a client in a way that provides the shape of the JSON before the stream has completed, then fills in the gaps as more data arrives... and then turns out to be a sneaky tutorial in how React Server Components work.</p>
<p>Ignoring the sneakiness, the imaginary streaming JSON format it describes is a fascinating thought exercise:</p>
<pre><code>{
  header: "$1",
  post: "$2",
  footer: "$3"
}
/* $1 */
"Welcome to my blog"
/* $3 */
"Hope you like it"
/* $2 */
{
  content: "$4",
  comments: "$5"
}
/* $4 */
"This is my article"
/* $5 */
["$6", "$7", "$8"]
/* $6 */
"This is the first comment"
/* $7 */
"This is the second comment"
/* $8 */
"This is the third comment"
</code></pre>
<p>After each block the full JSON document so far can be constructed, and Dan suggests interleaving <code>Promise()</code> objects along the way for placeholders that have not yet been fully resolved - so after receipt of block <code>$3</code> above (note that the blocks can be served out of order) the document would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
  header: "Welcome to my blog",
  post: new Promise(/* ... not yet resolved ... */),
  footer: "Hope you like it"
}
</code></pre>
<p>I'm tucking this idea away in case I ever get a chance to try it out in the future.
