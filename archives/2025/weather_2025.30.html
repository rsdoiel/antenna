Mesoscale Discussion 1835
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0339 PM CDT Tue Jul 29 2025

Areas affected...Northeastern Nevada into southwestern Oregon

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 292039Z - 292245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Strong to isolated severe thunderstorm wind gusts are
possible across portions of northeast Nevada into southwest Oregon
with dry thunderstorm outflow. Weather watch issuance is not
anticipated.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm development ongoing in a deeply-mixed, dry
boundary layer will result in some chances of strong to severe
thunderstorm wind gusts. With LCL heights at 3.5km and low-level RH
well below 20%, evaporative cooling within downdrafts will result in
gusty thunderstorm outflow. The greatest chance for strong to severe
winds will be along the leading edge of any outflow boundaries.

Mesoscale Discussion 1834
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0259 PM CDT Tue Jul 29 2025

Areas affected...parts of southwest into central Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 291959Z - 292200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Strongest thunderstorm development may become focused
across parts of southwestern into central Nebraska through 4-7 PM
CDT.  This may include a few evolving supercell structures posing a
risk for large hail, locally damaging wind gusts and perhaps a brief
tornado.

DISCUSSION...Within lee surface troughing across much of western
Kansas and adjacent portions of the high plains, a strongly heating
(including surface temperatures approaching 100 F) and increasingly
deeply mixed boundary layer is becoming characterized by moderate
CAPE based on latest objective analysis.  Mid-level inhibition is
gradually eroding and deepening convective development is evident,
including the initiation of scattered thunderstorm activity.  As a
weak mid-level perturbation shifts east of the Front Range, models
suggest that thunderstorm development may increase either side of a
remnant frontal zone within the lee surface trough, which is
forecast to slowly shift southeast of the high plains through early
evening.  

Near the nose of the stronger pre-frontal heating, now developing
north and east of the McCook NE vicinity toward areas between North
Platte and Kearney, surface dew points in the lower 70s F are
contributing to moderate to large CAPE along an initially stalled
segment of the frontal zone, where low-level convergence may
eventually focus strongest thunderstorm development.  Although wind
fields in lower through mid-levels are rather weak, easterly
near-surface flow veering to northerly near the eastward migrating
frontal wave (beneath southerly mid-level flow) may contribute to
sufficient shear for intensifying supercell structures posing a risk
for severe hail and perhaps a brief tornado.  Otherwise, storms,
particularly those forming in the strongly heated pre-frontal
environment, may pose a risk for locally strong to severe surface
gusts.

Mesoscale Discussion 1833
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0233 PM CDT Tue Jul 29 2025

Areas affected...Northwest Wyoming into southern Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 291933Z - 292130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...A severe thunderstorm watch may be needed this afternoon
across portions of northern Wyoming into southern Montana in
anticipation of severe thunderstorms capable of large hail and
damaging wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...Convective initiation is well underway across portions
of Yellowstone National Park into southern/central Montana, with
storms anticipated to move off the higher terrain and into the
better buoyancy this afternoon. MLCAPE at or exceeding 1000 J/kg,
combined with 30-40 kts of deep layer shear is expected to support
organized thunderstorms capable of large hail and damaging winds. 

Current SPC surface objective mesoanalysis shows Significant Hail
Parameter values of 1.5-2.0 across portions of southeastern Montana.
RAP/HRRR forecast profiles over the next few hours in the vicinity
of northern Wyoming into Montana corroborate this with steep
low-level lapse rates and strong deep-layer shear. Depending on the
location, low-level wind profiles vary from straight-line (favoring
supercell splits), to cyclonically curved (favoring right supercell
motions). Either scenario will support a large hail threat,
including significant (2.00+ inch) hail with the most robust,
isolated thunderstorms. The steep low-level lapse rates, coupled
with higher LCL heights/dryer boundary layer profiles in the
deeply-mixed air will also support a severe wind threat that will be
maximized with any bowing outflow segments. 

A severe thunderstorm watch may be needed within the next few hours.

Tropical Storm Keli Discussion Number   6
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP022025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Tue Jul 29 2025
 
Keli is a ragged-looking tropical storm.  Thunderstorms have been 
developing in the eastern semicircle of the the circulation 
suggesting some decrease in the southeasterly shear.  Satellite 
intensity estimates from PHFO and JTWC were T2.5 and T2.0, 
respectively, and the initial intensity will be held at 35 kt.  Keli 
is a small tropical cyclone and tropical-storm-force winds only 
extend outward from the center about 30 n mi.

The storm appears to be gradually accelerating and is moving 
westward at 13 kt.  A narrow ridge to the north should continue to 
steer Keli westward through the next day or so.  The track guidance 
envelope has shifted northward and increased in forward speed this 
cycle. Thus, the official track forecast has been nudged poleward 
and is slightly faster, lying between the previous forecast and the 
various consensus aids.

Only minimal changes have been made to the intensity forecast.  
Atmospheric conditions and the storm's proximity to Hurricane 
Iona are expected to gradually weaken Keli.  Model guidance has been 
advancing the dissipation of this small storm, and the official 
forecast now shows Keli opening into a trough by 48 h.  However, 
dissipation could still occur sooner than expected.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM HST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Iona was located
near latitude 10.9 North, longitude 155.7 West. Iona is moving
toward the west near 14 mph (22 km/h) and this general motion with 
some increase in forward speed is expected during the next few 
days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 125 mph (205 km/h) with higher
gusts. Iona is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale. Some additional strengthening is possible
today, but steady weakening is expected to begin by Wednesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles
(150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 957 mb (28.26 inches).

Hurricane Iona Discussion Number  11
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Tue Jul 29 2025
 
 
After rapidly intensifying over the past day or so, Iona's strength 
appears to have leveled off. The eye of the hurricane is not quite 
as distinct as it was a few hours ago and the convective pattern is 
slightly less symmetric.  The initial intensity is held at 110 kt, 
but this is near the high end of the latest satellite intensity 
estimates. Although Iona is quite powerful, its wind field remains 
compact. The hurricane- and tropical-storm-force wind radii are 
estimated to only extend up to 25 n mi and 80 n mi from the center, 
respectively.
 
The major hurricane is likely near its peak intensity. Water vapor 
images show a large area of dry and likely stable air just west of 
the system, and this stable air combined with increasing shear 
should cause Iona to steadily weaken during the next several days. 
The new forecast is a touch lower than the previous one and lies 
generally near the middle of the guidance envelope.
 
Iona has been moving due westward at about 12 kt on the south side 
of a narrow mid-level ridge situated across the Hawaiian Islands. 
The hurricane should continue westward on the south side of the 
ridge during the next few days, and then turn west-northwestward to 
northwestward after that when it moves toward the southwestern 
periphery of the high pressure system.  The models are again a 
little slower this cycle, and the new track forecast has been 
adjusted in that direction. Iona is expected to cross the 
International Date Line in about 4 days.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 556
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
230 PM MDT Tue Jul 29 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southern Montana
  Central and Northern Wyoming

* Effective this Tuesday afternoon and evening from 230 PM until
  900 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 80
    mph possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to develop and
intensify through the afternoon and persist into the early to mid
evening.  A few supercells may evolve from the stronger
thunderstorms during the afternoon.  Upscale growth into one or two
small clusters is expected.  Large to very large hail will
potentially accompany any supercell that develops, and severe gusts
(60-80 mph) are possible with the more intense downdrafts and
outflow.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 105
statute miles east and west of a line from 50 miles east northeast
of Harlowton MT to 45 miles east southeast of Lander WY. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 70 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
24025.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THERE IS A SLIGHT
RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON INTO TONIGHT FROM PARTS
OF THE NORTHERN HIGH PLAINS INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected from southern Montana into the
central High Plains, and across much of Nebraska and western Iowa.
Areas of severe gusts will be possible, with hail most likely over
western areas.

...20z Update...
The forecast largely remains on track with the early stages of
convective initiation underway across portions of north/northwest WY
and along the central High Plains per recent satellite imagery and
regional radar composites. The primary change for this forecast
update was the introduction of significant hail/wind areas to
portions of the northern Rockies. Latest GOES imagery shows
convection beginning to develop across northern WY/southern MT ahead
of a shortwave trough over the Great Basin. Regional 18z soundings
continue to sample steep (8-9 C/km) mid-level lapse rates, and GOES
imagery suggests 30-40 knot mid-level winds are overspreading the
region. As such, a favorable environment for a few supercells
appears to be in place and should support the potential for very
large hail. This activity should grow upscale through late evening
with the potential for a few significant (75+ mph) wind gusts. See
MCD #1833 for additional short-term details.

Across the Plains, the significant wind risk area has been adjusted
to better align with recent convective development along a
stationary boundary draped from southwest to northeast across NE and
where boundary-layer mixing appears to be deepest (based on observed
dewpoint depressions), which should favor stronger downdrafts and a
higher potential for significant gusts. See MCD #1834 for additional
short-term details.

..Moore.. 07/29/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1132 AM CDT Tue Jul 29 2025/

...CO/NE/IA...
Surface analysis indicates a frontal zone draped from IA
west-southwestward into the central High Plains.  Moist conditions
either side of the boundary and ample heating will promote a very to
extremely unstable airmass as temperatures continue to warm through
the mid afternoon.  Initial storms are progged over the central High
Plains with perhaps other activity continuing across the mid MS
Valley through the afternoon.  Hail/wind will be possible with the
earlier storms, but a gradual increase in storm coverage is forecast
this evening into the overnight near/north of the boundary.  Severe
gusts will tend to be the main severe hazard tonight.

...WY/MT...
Water-vapor imagery late this morning shows a prominent shortwave
trough over the northern Great Basin moving into eastern ID/WY this
afternoon.  A moist (dewpoints in the 50s to lower 60s) and
destabilizing boundary layer near/northeast of a residual frontal
zone, coupled with orographic and large-scale ascent, will lead to
scattered afternoon thunderstorms.  Easterly flow beneath moderate
westerlies will yield effective shear supporting organized storms,
including a few supercells and organized clusters.  Hail/wind will
be the primary severe hazards before a tendency for upscale growth
into linear clusters during the evening.

...Southeast OR...
A mid-level trough over the Sierra into the northern Great Basin,
embedded within larger-scale trough over the West Coast, will move
northward through this evening across the northern Great Basin into
southern OR/ID.  Scattered high-based thunderstorms will probably
focus along the leading edge of ascent as low to mid tropospheric
lapse rates exceed 9 deg C/km.  A relatively dry sub-cloud layer
will promote evaporatively cooled downdrafts capable of isolated
severe gusts (60-70 mph) with the stronger cores/clusters, mainly
during the 22-04 UTC period.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHERN
CALIFORNIA/NEVADA AND OREGON...

...20z Update...
Confidence continues to increase in widespread thunderstorms across
parts of the Northwest and northern Great Basin Wednesday. As
moisture associated with a prominent shortwave trough lifts
northward, thunderstorm development is likely by early afternoon
across the higher terrain of northern CA/NV and southern OR.
Forecast soundings depict weak buoyancy atop inverted-v
thermodynamic profiles, which would support high-based, fast-moving
thunderstorms over receptive fuels. With minimal rainfall
accumulations, lightning ignitions are likely. A few storms may
persist overnight as the shortwave trough continues northward into
southern WA and the Cascades. Given the threat for scattered to
numerous thunderstorms, critical dry thunderstorm highlights will be
maintained and shifted west/south for recent model guidance.

...Southern and eastern Great Basin...
Dry and breezy conditions are likely across parts of southern NV and
western UT D2/Wednesday afternoon. Aided by enhanced westerly flow
aloft, surface gusts of 15-25 mph and RH below 15% are likely. With
dry fuels, elevated fire-weather conditions are expected.

..Lyons.. 07/29/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0217 AM CDT Tue Jul 29 2025/

...Synopsis...
Upper ridging will persist across the central and eastern CONUS
while broad mid-level troughing remains in place along the West
Coast tomorrow (Wednesday). Mid-level moisture will continue to
pivot around the mid-level trough, toward the upper ridge, from the
Pacific Northwest into the northern Rockies. An embedded mid-level
impulse, accompanied by stronger flow aloft, will traverse the
northwest Great Basin and move northwestward into the Pacific
Northwest through the late afternoon to overnight period. As this
occurs, enhanced lift will promote at least scattered thunderstorms
over portions of the Pacific Northwest. Broad isolated
dry-thunderstorm highlights are in place for areas that will
experience lightning over dry fuels.

Along and east of the Cascades, forecast soundings depict inverted-v
thermodynamic profiles, which would support high-based, potentially
fast-moving thunderstorms. These storms may pass over fuels
receptive to fire spread, but with minimal rainfall accumulations
given fast storm speeds. Given the potentially higher density of
fast moving storms east of the Cascades, scattered dry thunderstorm
highlights have been introduced for central and eastern Oregon into
extreme northwest Nevada.

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Organized severe thunderstorms are not expected on Thursday.

...Discussion...
Heights will increase with the upper-level ridge on Wednesday across
the central US. Thunderstorm activity is expected to continue near
and south of a surface cold front extending from the central Plains
into the Missouri and Ohio Valleys and the Northeast. The increasing
subsidence influence from the high and generally weak lapse rates
will lead to less widespread severe potential with thunderstorms
across the central Plains into the Missouri/Ohio Valley. Given the
moderate to strong instability, an occasional stronger gust from a
wet micro burst could not be entirely ruled out, however, this risk
appears too isolated to include probabilities.

Along the edge of the upper level ridge across the
Carolinas/Virginia near to the front, a few stronger storms may be
possible. However, despite some steeper low-level lapse rates, poor
mid-level lapse rates and little to no shear will likely negate any
more widespread organized severe risk.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PARTS OF  THE
SOUTHERN AND  CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS AND FROM THE MIDWEST TO THE MID
ATLANTIC AND NORTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are possible from the Mid-Missouri/Mississippi
Valley vicinity to parts of the Mid-Atlantic/New England, and the
southern and central High Plains on Wednesday.

...Synopsis...
An MCS will be ongoing across the Midwest at the start of the
D2/Wednesday period, with residual outflow becoming a focus for
afternoon thunderstorm re-development. A shortwave will eject across
the northern Rockies with modest upper-level flow for organization
for thunderstorms across the southern and central High Plains.

..Southern and Central High Plains Vicinity...
Upper-level flow will overspread the northern Rockies on Tuesday,
with easterly upslope surface flow supporting scattered thunderstorm
development in Colorado/Wyoming. Modest deep layer shear around
30-35 kts will support potential for a supercell or two capable of
large hail and damaging wind. 

Further thunderstorm development is likely with the surface trough
from eastern Colorado into New Mexico and along a front across
central Oklahoma into the Texas Panhandle. Steep lapse rates and
modest shear profiles will support some potential for strong to
severe wind and hail. The Marginal Risk was extended southward into
southeastern CO and the OK/TX Panhandles with this outlook.

...Midwest...
An MCS will be ongoing at the start of the D2 period across portions
of IA, southern MN, and MO. This will pose some risk for severe wind
through the early D2 period before weakening. With daytime heating,
additional thunderstorm development is likely in the vicinity of
this residual outflow boundary and in the vicinity of a front across
the Ohio Valley by the afternoon. Steep mid-level lapse rates and
shear near the front should support a few organized storms capable
of strong to severe wind.

...Northeast...
Stronger mid-level flow is expected across the northeastern US as a
jet streak moves through a broad upper-level low in Canada across
portions of the northeast. Deep layer shear around 40-50 kts and
marginal CAPE profiles will support potential for a supercell or two
capable of large hail and damaging wind. The Marginal Risk was
extended north into ME with this outlook to account for this risk.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1144 AM CDT Tue Jul 29 2025

Valid 291700Z - 301200Z

...17z Update...
No major changes were made to the prior outlook. Isolated dry
thunderstorms are expected across the higher terrain of northern CA,
OR and western ID this afternoon and evening. A few of these storms
are likely to pose a risk for lightning ignitions within dry fuels.
A few storms my persist overnight across eastern OR with a continued
threat for occasional lightning strikes. Will maintain the IsoDryT
highlights with little change.

...Southern Great Basin...
A few hours of dry and breezy conditions are possible this afternoon
across parts of southern NV and far southwestern UT. Enhanced
mid-level flow will overspread drier parts of the Great Basin.
Isolated wind gusts of 15 mph and RH below 15% could support some
locally elevated fire-weather potential this afternoon. Though the
lack of stronger winds suggests this threat will remain isolated.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0140 AM CDT Tue Jul 29 2025/

...Synopsis...
An upper ridge will persist across the CONUS today, with mid-level
moisture poised to pivot around the western extent of the ridge over
portions of the northwestern Great Basin into the Pacific Northwest.
Here, high-based thunderstorms should develop atop a dry boundary
layer, with a mix of wet and dry thunderstorms expected. Isolated
dry thunderstorm highlights have been issued given the presence of
dry fuels.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1132 AM CDT Tue Jul 29 2025

Valid 291630Z - 301200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
INTO TONIGHT FROM PARTS OF THE NORTHERN HIGH PLAINS INTO THE CENTRAL
PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected from southern Montana into the
central High Plains, and across much of Nebraska and western Iowa.
Areas of severe gusts will be possible, with hail most likely over
western areas.

...CO/NE/IA...
Surface analysis indicates a frontal zone draped from IA
west-southwestward into the central High Plains.  Moist conditions
either side of the boundary and ample heating will promote a very to
extremely unstable airmass as temperatures continue to warm through
the mid afternoon.  Initial storms are progged over the central High
Plains with perhaps other activity continuing across the mid MS
Valley through the afternoon.  Hail/wind will be possible with the
earlier storms, but a gradual increase in storm coverage is forecast
this evening into the overnight near/north of the boundary.  Severe
gusts will tend to be the main severe hazard tonight.

...WY/MT...
Water-vapor imagery late this morning shows a prominent shortwave
trough over the northern Great Basin moving into eastern ID/WY this
afternoon.  A moist (dewpoints in the 50s to lower 60s) and
destabilizing boundary layer near/northeast of a residual frontal
zone, coupled with orographic and large-scale ascent, will lead to
scattered afternoon thunderstorms.  Easterly flow beneath moderate
westerlies will yield effective shear supporting organized storms,
including a few supercells and organized clusters.  Hail/wind will
be the primary severe hazards before a tendency for upscale growth
into linear clusters during the evening.

...Southeast OR...
A mid-level trough over the Sierra into the northern Great Basin,
embedded within larger-scale trough over the West Coast, will move
northward through this evening across the northern Great Basin into
southern OR/ID.  Scattered high-based thunderstorms will probably
focus along the leading edge of ascent as low to mid tropospheric
lapse rates exceed 9 deg C/km.  A relatively dry sub-cloud layer
will promote evaporatively cooled downdrafts capable of isolated
severe gusts (60-70 mph) with the stronger cores/clusters, mainly
during the 22-04 UTC period.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
INTO TONIGHT FROM PARTS OF THE NORTHERN HIGH PLAINS INTO THE CENTRAL
PLAINS....

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected from southern Montana into the
central High Plains, and across much of Nebraska and western Iowa.
Areas of damaging winds will be possible, with hail most likely over
western areas.

...CO/NE/IA...
Morning water vapor loops show a large ridge over the central US,
with a plume of ample mid-level moisture moving northward across the
southern Rockies.  Northeasterly surface winds across northeast CO
will help moisten/destabilize the region, leading to thunderstorms
off the foothills of central CO by mid-afternoon.  These storms will
be in a region of moderate CAPE, but rather weak vertical shear and
winds aloft.  Clusters of storms capable of small hail and gusty
winds will build eastward through the afternoon into a progressively
more moist/unstable airmass, and may eventually intensify into an
organized MCS across NE/western IA.  This activity may persist well
into the night with a risk of locally damaging wind gusts.

...WY/MT...
Multiple weak shortwave troughs are tracking northward across the
Great Basin today toward the northern Rockies.  This will lead to
scattered afternoon thunderstorms over the mountains of southwest MT
and northern WY.  Surface dewpoints in the 50s along with strong
daytime heating will result in considerable CAPE, along with
sufficient westerly winds aloft for some convective organization. 
Initial storms over the higher terrain will pose some risk of hail
and gusty winds.  As the activity builds eastward into the plains, a
greater risk for large hail and severe winds will likely develop
through the evening.

...DISCUSSION...
Surface high pressure will build into the eastern CONUS this weekend
which will push a cold front south to near the Gulf Coast. Limited
instability in the wake of this front should limit severe weather
potential for many areas east of the Plains. As the upper-level
ridge weakens across the Plains by the end of the weekend, more
zonal flow across the Mountains will lead to weak lee troughing.
Southerly/southeasterly flow will result in some instability across
the High Plains. Mid-level flow will not be that strong, but should
be sufficient for some isolated severe weather potential. However,
predictability decreases significantly once the ridge breaks down
and therefore, it is unclear when or where a more organized severe
weather threat may occur.

Forecast Discussion Number 9</h2>

Hurricane Iona Discussion Number   9
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Mon Jul 28 2025
 
Iona has a very impressive satellite presentation this evening, with 
very cold cloud tops ranging from -70°C to -80°C surrounding the 
well-defined eye.  Subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates 
came in at 5.0/90 knots from PHFO and 5.5/102 knots from SAB.  The 
ADT and AiDT objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS have ranged 
between 97 and 104 knots over the past several hours. Based on a 
blend of these data, the initial intensity for this advisory has 
been increased to 100 knots, making Iona a Category 3 major
hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale.
 
Iona is moving due west, or 270 degrees at 11 knots. This general 
motion, along with a gradual increase in forward speed, is expected 
to continue over the next several days as the cyclone moves along 
the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge to the north.  A turn 
toward the west-northwest is anticipated by late in the week as the 
system is influenced by a weakness in the mid-level ridge, created 
by a developing upper-level low west of the International Date Line. 
The official track forecast remains near the center of the guidance 
envelope and is nearly identical to the previous advisory.  
Confidence remains high that Iona will stay well south of the 
Hawaiian Islands.
 
Environmental conditions appear conducive for further 
intensification during the next 12 hours or so, as Iona will remain 
over warm sea surface temperatures near 28C, with sufficient 
mid-level moisture and minimal vertical wind shear.  Given the 
conducive environment, the intensity forecast calls for Iona to 
reach category 4 status later tonight or early Tuesday.  Steady 
weakening is forecast to begin Tuesday night or Wednesday and 
continue into the weekend, as the system moves over slightly cooler 
waters, encounters increasing westerly vertical wind shear, and 
begins to entrain drier mid-level air.  The intensity forecast has 
been adjusted slightly upward from the previous advisory, reflecting 
the latest trends in the intensity guidance.  This aligns well with 
regional hurricane models during the next 24 to 36 hours, and then 
lies near or slightly below the intensity guidance envelope 
thereafter.

Tropical Storm Keli Discussion Number   4
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP022025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Mon Jul 28 2025
  
Keli has not changed much this evening, with an area of deep 
convection to the west of the low-level center. The system is 
struggling to become better organized due to vertical wind shear. 
The subjective Dvorak satellite intensity estimates were T2.0 from 
both PHFO and JTWC. Using these estimates and satellite trends, the 
intensity is held at 35 kt for this advisory. Keli is a small 
tropical cyclone and tropical-storm-force winds only extend outward 
about 30 n mi from the center.
  
The storm is moving westward, with an estimated motion of 280/10 kt. 
Keli is forecast to continue moving generally westward for the next 
few days steered by a mid-level ridge north of the system.  The 
official track forecast is similar to the previous, although with a 
slightly faster forward motion.
 
Keli is forecast to remain over warm sea surface temperatures, but 
wind shear is forecast to increase later today, thus the official 
intensity forecast shows little change in intensity during the next 
day or so. As Keli continues to feel the upper-level outflow of 
nearby Hurricane Iona the system should begin to weaken by 36 h, and 
dissipate by Day 3. The official intensity forecast lies near the 
simple and corrected consensus aids. Global models indicate that the 
shear could take its toll on Keli quicker than forecast, and due to 
the small storm size it is possible that the system could dissipate 
into a trough earlier then officially forecast.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 552
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
345 PM CDT Mon Jul 28 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Extreme west central Minnesota
  Northern Nebraska
  Central and eastern South Dakota

* Effective this Monday afternoon and evening from 345 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Widespread damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 90
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter likely
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Initial severe storm development is underway across south
central South Dakota, where supercells with isolated very large hail
up to 2.5 inches in diameter will be possible, as well as an
isolated tornado or two with storms near the front closer to Huron. 
Eventual upscale growth into one or more clusters is expected, with
an increasing threat for swaths of damaging winds (potentially up to
80-90 mph) with any bowing segments.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 75
statute miles north and south of a line from 50 miles north
northwest of Valentine NE to 20 miles southeast of Brookings SD. For
a complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU2).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 551...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 80 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 650. Mean storm motion vector
26030.

Mesoscale Discussion 1824
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0247 PM CDT Mon Jul 28 2025

Areas affected...parts of south central and southeastern South
Dakota...adjacent north central Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 281947Z - 282145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered, intensifying thunderstorm development, posing a
risk for a few strong downbursts and perhaps some hail, appears
possible by 4-6 PM CDT.  Timing of a potential severe weather watch
issuance remains unclear, but trends are being monitored for this
possibility.

DISCUSSION...A surface cold front, now advancing south of Pierre,
Philip and Rapid City is becoming better defined, with strengthening
differential heating along and ahead of it, centered near the
western South Dakota/Nebraska state border northeastward across the
Winner toward Huron vicinities.  While temperatures are approaching
100 F within the corridor of stronger boundary-layer heating,
surface dew points have been slower to mix below 70F, and through
the 60s F, than suggested by model forecast soundings at Winner and
Valentine.  Even so, latest objective analysis suggests that the
pre- and post-cold frontal boundary layer remains strongly capped
beneath the warm and elevated mixed-layer air as far north as the
North/South Dakota state border vicinity.

Mid/upper support for sustained boundary-layer based convection
anytime soon remains unclear, although it appears possible that a
subtle perturbation progressing across and east-northeast of the
Black Hills is contributing to ongoing attempts at convective
development.  It appears more probable that with further insolation,
continued heating and deeper mixing within the pre-frontal
boundary-layer may eventually support intensifying, high-based
thunderstorm development late this afternoon.  In the presence of
strong deep-layer shear, this activity could pose a risk for severe
hail and increasing potential for strong downbursts into early
evening.

Hurricane Iona Discussion Number   7
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Mon Jul 28 2025
 
After rapidly strengthening overnight, the cloud pattern and
overall structure of Iona has changed little during the past 6
hours.  A fairly symmetric Central Dense Overcast is seen over the
center in geostationary satellite imagery, but there has been no
recent microwave data to examine the inner core structure. The
latest subjective satellite intensity estimates are T4.0/65 kt
from SAB, and T3.5/55 kt from both PHFO and JTWC.  Objective
estimates remain lower, although it is possible that the small size 
of the cyclone is making it difficult for those techniques to 
capture the true intensity.  The initial intensity for this advisory 
will remain 65 kt, in line with the higher subjective estimate from 
SAB.
 
Iona is located within a low-shear environment and over sea surface
temperatures of around 28C.  Those conditions favor strengthening,
however some nearby dry mid-level air may have been entrained in 
the circulation which likely caused the recent pause in
intensification.  Given the favorable upper-air pattern and warm 
sea surface temperatures, additional strengthening appears likely.  
The regional hurricane models are more aggressive this cycle and 
indicate that Iona could be near or at major hurricane strength in 
a day or so.  As a result, the lastest official forecast calls 
for rapid strengthening during the next 24 hours and the peak 
intensity is raised slightly from the previous advisory.  Around 
midweek, slightly lower SSTs and an increase in vertical
wind shear are expected to cause gradual weakening through the
remainder of the forecast period.  The updated NHC intensity 
forecast is close to the regional models through 24 hours, and then 
follows the latest multi-model (IVCN) consensus aid after that time.
 
Iona is moving westward or 270 degrees at 9 kt.  The storm is
forecast to move along the southern portion of a subtropical ridge
that is well established over the central Pacific.  This steering
pattern should take the storm westward during the next day or so,
followed by a faster west-northwestward motion after midweek. The
updated track forecast is once again near the center of the model
envelope, close to the various consensus aids.  Confidence remains
high that Iona will stay well south of the Hawaiian Islands.

Tropical Storm Keli Discussion Number   2
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP022025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Mon Jul 28 2025

ASCAT data from around 1830 Z showed a small area of 
tropical-storm-force winds just north of the center of the system.  
Based on that data, the depression has been upgraded to Tropical 
storm Keli with maximum winds of about 35 kt. Although the winds 
are estimated to be higher than earlier this morning, satellite 
images indicate that the deep convection has generally decreased 
during the past few hours. Keli is a very compact storm with its 
associated cloud field extending only about 90 n mi across. 
 
The storm is moving westward at about 9 kt. Keli is expected to 
continue westward, following Iona, during the next few days as it 
remains on the south side of a narrow mid-level ridge. The latest 
track models have trended a little to the north and are faster this 
cycle, and the official forecast has been nudged in those 
directions.
 
The environmental conditions could favor a little more strengthening 
during the next day or so while the storm is over relatively warm 
water, embedded in a moist air mass, and in generally moderate 
shear conditions. By the middle of the week, however, Iona's outflow 
will likely impinge on the cyclone. These unfavorable upper-level 
winds and stable air should end the opportunity for strengthening 
and cause weakening. Most of the models show Keli dissipating in 
about 2 days, except for the GFS which hangs on to the cyclone for 
about 3 days. Based on the latest guidance, the official forecast 
has moved up dissipation by 24 hours.

  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorm development is expected through the
afternoon, including the potential for a few supercells.  Large hail
of 1-2.5 inches in diameter will be possible, while severe outflow
gusts of 60-70 mph will be possible with upscale growth into a
cluster or two this evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles north and south of a line from 35 miles northwest of
Helena MT to 75 miles east of Lewistown MT. For a complete depiction
of the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
WOU1).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.

Mesoscale Discussion 1821
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0721 AM CDT Mon Jul 28 2025

Areas affected...parts of western/central ND

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 281221Z - 281415Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...A persistent supercell or two may yield a confined swath
of large hail and strong gusts into late morning. Monitoring for
possible Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...A couple elevated supercells are ongoing across
southwest/west-central ND, along and just north of I-94. Despite a
lack of reported severe thus far, strong westerly speed shear above
3 km (now sampled by the BIS VWP and 12Z observed sounding) has
sustained persistent organizational structures as these cells spread
across the MT/ND border. This elevated activity is likely to persist
into midday along the buoyancy gradient across western ND. Large
hail and strong gusts should be the primary hazards. Severe wind may
increase if flanking convection can form along the outflow into a
destabilizing airmass over SD. But ongoing low clouds/fog in the
swath of richest low-level moisture casts uncertainty on whether
that scenario may occur soon or later today.

Tropical Storm Iona Discussion Number   5
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Sun Jul 27 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Iona has improved this evening, with a
well-defined curved banding structure and excellent upper-level
outflow evident in all quadrants. A recent 28/0650Z Metop-C ASCAT
pass showed a few wind barbs near 40 knots. The latest subjective
Dvorak current intensity estimates came in at 3.0/45 knots from
PHFO, 3.0/45 knots from SAB, and 2.5/35 knots from JTWC. Objective
intensity estimates ranged from 42 to 49 knots. Taking a blend of
these data, the initial intensity for this advisory has been raised
to 45 knots, which may still be slightly conservative.
 
Tropical Storm Iona is moving westward at 270 degrees/10 knots. This
general motion is expected to continue over the next several days as
the cyclone moves along the southern periphery of a subtropical
ridge to the north. A gradual increase in forward speed is also
expected, due to a strengthening low- to mid-level ridge north of
the system. The track forecast remains closely aligned with a blend
of the FSSE, HCCA, and GFEX consensus guidance and is nearly
unchanged from the previous advisory. Confidence remains high that
Iona will stay well south of the Hawaiian Islands.
 
The environment appears conducive for further intensification over
the next day or so, as Iona remains over warm waters near 28C, with
adequate mid-level moisture and very light vertical wind shear. In
fact, the latest GFS and ECMWF SHIPS guidance indicates more than a
30 percent chance of a 25-knot increase in intensity over the next
24 hours. Given the current structure and favorable conditions, the
intensity forecast explicitly calls for rapid intensification during
the next 24 hours, with Iona expected to become a hurricane late
Monday or Monday night. Iona should reach peak intensity Monday
night or Tuesday, with steady weakening anticipated beginning
Tuesday night, as the system moves over slightly cooler waters,
begins to experience increasing westerly vertical wind shear, and
starts to entrain drier mid-level air. The cyclone is expected to
become a post-tropical remnant low by Day 5 and could potentially
weaken into a trough by that time. The intensity forecast has been
raised from the previous advisory to reflect the latest trends in
the guidance, and is best aligned with the FSSE and IVCN consensus
solutions.

Tropical Depression One-C Discussion Number   3
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 AM HST Sun Jul 27 2025
 
The system continues to become better organized this morning, with 
deep convection in curved banding generally to the west of the 
center. Recent imagery shows that convection has been developing the 
last few hours near the low-level center, with some increased 
curvature. Subjective Dvorak satellite intensity estimates from HFO 
and SAB were T/2.0 this cycle. A scatterometer pass is expected 
shortly which should give a better idea of the surface winds. Using 
the Dvorak estimates, the intensity is held at 30 kt.
 
The system is moving westward at about 270/10 kt. A westward motion 
is expected the next several days as the cyclone moves on the south 
side of a mid-level ridge. There continues to be some spread in the 
along track guidance, although there is high confidence on the 
system remaining well south of the Hawaiian islands. The NHC track 
forecast is similar to the previous, and lies closest to the HCCA 
corrected consensus aids.
 
Environmental conditions appear favorable for some gradual 
strengthening the next couple of days. The hurricane regional models 
remain at the higher end of the guidance envelope, and the latest 
NHC forecast is near the previous. Beyond 48 h, a gradual weakening 
trend should begin as the system moves over slightly cooler sea 
surface temperatures, a drier airmass, and vertical wind shear is 
expected to increase. The gradual weakening trend will cause the 
system to become a remnant low by day 5, potentially even opening 
into a trough.

Mesoscale Discussion 1811
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0257 PM CDT Sun Jul 27 2025

Areas affected...central/eastern North Carolina...southern Virginia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 271957Z - 272200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorm activity will promote a few
instances of strong to severe wind this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Scattered thunderstorm activity has increased in
coverage across portions of eastern North Carolina this afternoon.
The air mass in this region is very hot and unstable, but deep layer
shear for a more organized severe threat remains weak. Given the
deep moisture and strong instability, a few wet downbursts may
produce some instances of strong to severe wind. Overall, this
threat will remain too isolated for watch issuance.

Tropical Depression One-C Discussion Number   1
NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center Honolulu HI   CP012025
Issued by NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL
1100 PM HST Sat Jul 26 2025

Deep convection has persisted over the area of low pressure well 
southeast of the Hawaiian Islands for the last 12 hours or so, with 
the latest satellite images showing improved organization and a 
better defined banding structure.  The latest subjective Dvorak 
current intensity estimates came in at 2.0/30 knots from PHFO, 
1.5/25 knots from SAB, and 1.0/25 knots from JTWC.  A recent 
27/0620Z Metop-B ASCAT pass showed a well-defined low-level 
circulation with a large swath of 25-knot winds and a few embedded 
25- to 30-knot wind barbs.  Given the improved structure and 
organization of the system, advisories are being initiated on the 
first tropical cyclone of the season in the central Pacific, 
Tropical Depression One-C.  The initial intensity will be set at 30 
knots.

Tropical Depression One-C is moving toward the west, or 270 degrees, 
at 10 knots.  This general westward motion is expected to continue 
over the next couple of days as the system moves along the southern 
periphery of a subtropical ridge to the north.  Beyond 48 hours, the 
forward speed is expected to increase considerably in response to a 
low- to mid-level ridge strengthening to the north of cyclone.  The 
track forecast closely follows a blend of the TVCE and HCCA 
consensus guidance.

The environment will remain conducive for intensification over the 
next couple of days, as One-C remains over warm waters between 28 
and 29C, with adequate mid-level moisture and light to moderate 
easterly shear.  As a result, the intensity forecast calls for 
steady strengthening during this time, with One-C becoming Tropical 
Storm Iona on Sunday.  Beyond 60 hours, the cyclone will begin to 
experience increasing westerly vertical wind shear while also 
entraining drier mid-level air.  This is expected to lead to steady 
weakening, with the system becoming a tropical depression again 
around day 5.  The intensity forecast is best aligned with the HCCA 
intensity consensus guidance.
