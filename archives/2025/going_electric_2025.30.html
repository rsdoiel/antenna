<p>

Chinese social media, and it’s disappointingly about what we expected: a
slightly decontented version of the Model Y.

<p>
Electric bikes are booming in popularity across the US, and cities are
starting to take notice. From famous programs like those in Denver to
smaller initiatives around the country, local governments are rolling
out rebate and incentive programs to make e-bikes more affordable,
especially for lower-income residents. The goal? Get more people out of
cars and onto two wheels.

Tesla will use Samsung for as a supplier for its self-driving computer’s
next-gen hardware in a $16.5 billion deal, according to Tesla CEO Elon
Musk.
</p>
<p>
But despite planning two generations ahead, the company still doesn’t
have a solution to bring the promised full autonomy to hardware that
it’s been promising that capability to since 2016.

Canadian startup Beachman has just unveiled its latest electric
two-wheeler, the ’64, a vintage-styled electric motorcycle that looks
like it rolled straight out of the 1960s. With throwback café racer
design and a respectable top speed of 45 mph (72 km/h), it’s a slick
little ride with a curious twist: it calls itself an e-bike.
