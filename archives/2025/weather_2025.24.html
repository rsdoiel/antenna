Mesoscale Discussion 1383
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0324 PM CDT Fri Jun 20 2025

Areas affected...far eastern Montana and northwest South Dakota into
central North Dakota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 202024Z - 202230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Storms are expected to initiate over southeast Montana by
22Z, eventually organizing into a cluster or MCS as it travels into
ND. Significant damaging gusts as well as large hail are forecast.

DISCUSSION...Strong heating continues over the region as low
pressure deepens from southeast MT into western SD. Moist low-level
trajectories extend from the eastern Dakotas westward (north of the
low) and into far eastern MT, where visible imagery indicates
increase CU fields.

Meanwhile, an impressive surge of heated air is spreading into the
area from the southwest, with many sites seeing a large jump in
temperatures and wind speeds. While some warming aloft is indicated
as well, the continued westward influx of moisture and surface
heating will result in an uncapped air mass over the High Plains,
with initiation likely by late afternoon.

Indications are that convection over southeast MT will grow over the
next few hours, with cells producing hail and gusty winds. With
time, this activity should develop into a severe MCS, with
increasing threat of significant wind gusts as well as continued
threat of hail. As such, a watch will likely be needed soon.

Mesoscale Discussion 1382
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0249 PM CDT Fri Jun 20 2025

Areas affected...portions of northeastern New Mexico into eastern
Colorado...northwestern Kansas...and southwestern Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 201949Z - 202215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A couple of severe gusts may occur with dry downbursts or
microbursts. Storms should be isolated and brief, precluding a WW
issuance.

DISCUSSION...Upper-support from a mid-level trough is grazing the
central High Plains, where a deep and dry boundary layer exists and
continues to mix. 18Z RAP forecast soundings depict boundary-layer
mixing up to 500 mb in spots, with the 19Z mesoanalysis showing 9-10
C/km 0-3km lapse rates already in place. Visible satellite and MRMS
mosaic radar imagery show attempts at convective initiation and the
current thinking is that additional storm development is possible by
afternoon peak heating. Should a more robust updraft and associated
storm core develop, rapid evaporative cooling may support a dry
downburst or microburst, accompanied by strong to severe gusts.
However, since storms may be quite brief and isolated in nature, the
overall severe threat should be too localized to warrant a severe
thunderstorm watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1381
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0132 PM CDT Fri Jun 20 2025

Areas affected...parts of southwest into west-central Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 201832Z - 202130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered storms will form over much of southwest Montana
and into Idaho, and spread northeastward toward central Montana.
Scattered strong to severe gusts along with marginal hail may occur.

DISCUSSION...Visible satellite imagery shows strong heating over
much of the region ahead of the upper trough/midlevel temperature
gradient. The exception is north of the stationary front near GTF
where thick low-level clouds exist with cool north winds. Convection
is already increasing over the higher terrain from central ID into
southwest MT, and more substantial storms are likely to develop by
about 20-21Z. 

GPS PWAT sensors currently indicate around 0.80-0.95 inches, which
is sufficient to support robust convection given steepening lapse
rates. Deep-layer shear around 50 kt may support cells producing
isolated hail near severe thresholds. While temperatures are cooler
downstream, some of that air should mix out given persistent
boundary layer mixing/heating upstream. Moderate winds aloft and
steepening boundary layer lapse rates may support
northeastward-moving bowing structures capable of producing damaging
gusts toward central MT.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 447
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
250 PM MDT Fri Jun 20 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southeast Montana
  Southwest North Dakota
  Northwest South Dakota

* Effective this Friday afternoon and evening from 250 PM until
  900 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 3
    inches in diameter likely
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected to rapidly develop this
afternoon over southeast Montana and track eastward through the
early evening.  Supercells capable of very large hail and damaging
winds appear to be the main concern.  A tornado or two is also
possible.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles north and south of a line from 40 miles north
northwest of Broadus MT to 85 miles northeast of Lemmon SD. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU7).

Mesoscale Discussion 1371
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0341 PM CDT Thu Jun 19 2025

Areas affected...eastern Montana and western North Dakota.

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 192041Z - 192215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...There is a conditional supercell threat across eastern
Montana and western North Dakota with a threat for large hail and
severe wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...Strong heating across eastern Montana has resulted in a
mostly uncapped airmass (according to SPC mesoanalysis) with 750 to
1500 J/kg MLCAPE. It is unclear whether storms will form this
afternoon, but deepening towering cumulus on visible satellite
indicate one or two storms may form this afternoon or during the
early evening hours, significantly earlier than indicated by CAM
guidance. If storms form, strong 45-50 knot shear across the region
should result in supercells with a threat for large hail. In
addition, given the hot, deeply-mixed boundary layer, severe wind
will also be a threat from this activity. 

Some weak support from a low-level jet across the northern Plains
could maintain this threat during the evening, and perhaps through
the overnight hours as it moves east across North Dakota.

Satellite/radar trends will continue to be monitored, and if storm
development appears imminent, a severe thunderstorm watch will be
issued.

0334 PM CDT Thu Jun 19 2025

Areas affected...New York City into New England

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 441...443...

Valid 192034Z - 192230Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 441, 443
continues.

SUMMARY...As temperatures have warmed in New England, storms have
shown some intensification recently. Wind damage remains possible
late this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Strong to severe storms continue from the New York City
vicinity into New England. With pockets of upper 80s/low 90s F in
parts of New England, storms have actually shown a modest increase
in intensity over the last couple hours. Activity has remained more
cellular with southern extent. These cells will continue moving
northeast through the afternoon. Isolated wind damage is possible.
Farther north, Effective shear and forcing for ascent are greater. A
linear segment is moving north-northeast in northern Vermont.
Additional strong storms in southern Quebec may eventually impact
portions of western/northern Maine. Even though temperatures have
remained cooler in Maine, stronger forcing should still promote a
wind damage threat.

Mesoscale Discussion 1369
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0222 PM CDT Thu Jun 19 2025

Areas affected...South-central Virginia into central/eastern
Maryland and southeast Pennsylvania

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 442...

Valid 191922Z - 192115Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 442
continues.

SUMMARY...Strong to severe winds are the primary threat this
afternoon, particularly with linear segments. The environment in the
DC/Baltimore/Philadelphia remains favorable.

DISCUSSION...Strong to isolated severe wind gusts have occurred with
storms just east of the Blue Ridge this afternoon. Given the linear
structures that have evolved in northern Virginia and central
Maryland, areas ahead of this activity will have a greater risk for
strong/damaging winds. Temperatures in Virginia and Maryland have
risen into the low 90s F with upper 80s F into southeast
Pennsylvania. Steep low-level lapse rates and 1500-2000 J/kg MLCAPE
will support a continued threat for strong to severe wind gusts as
storms move towards the DC/Baltimore/Philadelphia corridor.

Tropical Storm Erick Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052025
300 PM CST Thu Jun 19 2025
 
Erick continues to rapidly weaken as it moves farther inland over
the rugged terrain of Mexico. The inner core has now nearly
completely collapsed, and the overall convective pattern has become
quite ragged. Based on the degraded appearance and decreasing
satellite intensity estimates, the initial intensity is lowered to
45 kt, making Erick a tropical storm.
 
Continued rapid weakening is forecast as Erick continues
northwestward. The storm is expected to dissipate over the
mountains in southwestern Mexico tonight.
 
Even though Erick is no longer a hurricane, heavy rains will linger
over portions of southern and southwestern Mexico through tonight.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Erick will continue to produce heavy rainfall across portions of

* Punta Maldonado to Tecpan de Galeana
 
A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM CST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Erick was
located near latitude 17.4 North, longitude 99.7 West. Erick is
moving toward the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h) and this general
motion is expected through tonight. On the forecast track, the
center of Erick is forecast to move over southern and southwestern
Mexico until it dissipates tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Continued rapid weakening is forecast, and Erick will likely
dissipate tonight.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1000 mb (29.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Erick can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header
WTPZ45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Erick will produce additional rainfall of 6 to 8 inches of 
rainfall mainly in the state of Guerrero with storm totals of 16 
inches possible. Life-threatening flooding and mudslides are 
expected, especially in areas of steep terrain. Rainfall totals of 2 
to 4 inches, with maximum totals of 6 inches, are expected across 
the states of Michoacan and Oaxaca.

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with Erick, 
please see the National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic 
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to occur for a few more
hours in the warning area. Wind speeds atop and on the windward
sides of hills and mountains are often up to 30 percent stronger
than the near-surface winds indicated in this advisory, and in some
elevated locations could be even greater.
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge is expected to gradually subside through
tonight.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Erick will continue affecting the coast of
southern Mexico through the evening. These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 AM CST (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Erick was located 
along the coast of Mexico near latitude 16.3 North, longitude 98.3 
West, just east of Punta Maldonado.  Erick is moving toward the 
northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general motion is expected 
to continue through tonight.  On the forecast track, the center of 
Erick is expected to move inland over southern Mexico throughout 
the day.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 125 mph (205 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Erick is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Erick is expected to rapidly weaken over the 
mountains of Mexico, and the system is likely to dissipate tonight 
or early Friday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90
miles (150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 950 mb (28.05 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Erick can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header
WTPZ45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Erick will produce rainfall totals of 8 to 12 inches, with
maximum totals of 16 inches, across the Mexican states of Oaxaca and
Guerrero. This rainfall will lead to life-threatening flooding and
mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain. Rainfall totals of
2 to 4 inches, with maximum totals of 6 inches, are expected across
the Mexican states of Chiapas, Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with Erick,
please see the National Weather Service Storm Total Rainfall Graphic
available at hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning 
area during the next few hours, with destructive winds near the core 
of Erick.  Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch 
area today.  Tropical storm conditions are ongoing in the tropical 
storm warning area.  Wind speeds atop and on the windward sides of 
hills and mountains are often up to 30 percent stronger than the 
near-surface winds indicated in this advisory, and in some elevated 
locations could be even greater.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous, life-threatening storm surge is expected
to produce coastal flooding near and to the east of where the center
crosses the coast, in areas of onshore winds.  The surge will be
accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Erick will continue affecting the coast of 
southern Mexico throughout the day.  These swells are likely to 
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please 
consult products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Erick Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052025
300 AM CST Thu Jun 19 2025
 
Erick is about to make landfall along the southern coast of Mexico. 
Its rapid strengthening episode has ended, likely due to the 
interaction with land.  The eye has become obscured on satellite 
imagery, and the intensity is adjusted to 120 kt in agreement with 
the latest objective estimates from UW/CIMSS.  Erick remains an 
extremely dangerous category 4 hurricane.  However, rapid weakening 
will occur after the center moves inland and the system moves over 
the mountainous terrain of Mexico.

Smoothing out the trochoidal wobbles in the track, the motion 
estimate, 310/8 kt, remains about the same as before.  This general 
motion, on the south side of a weak mid-level ridge, is likely to 
continue until the system dissipates within the next day or two.  
The official track forecast is just slightly west of the previous 
one and close to the latest corrected consensus, HCCA, guidance.
  
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Erick is an extremely dangerous category 4 hurricane, and
devastating wind damage is likely near its core. Take shelter in 
the interior portion of a well-built structure and remain sheltered 
until after hazardous conditions pass.

2. Erick will produce heavy rainfall across portions of Southwest 
Mexico through this week. Life-threatening flooding and mudslides 
are likely, especially in areas of steep terrain.

3. A dangerous, life-threatening storm surge is expected to produce
coastal flooding near and to the east of where the center crosses
the coast, in areas of onshore winds.  The surge will be accompanied
by large and destructive waves.

Mesoscale Discussion 1351
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0308 PM CDT Wed Jun 18 2025

Areas affected...southern IN...far northern KY/southwest OH

Concerning...Tornado Watch 434...435...

Valid 182008Z - 182145Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 434, 435 continues.

SUMMARY...Damaging wind and a couple tornadoes remain possible with
the southern portion of a QLCS and broken convection to its south.
Downstream watch issuance will be likely east of WWs 434/435 by
early evening.

DISCUSSION...The slower-moving but yet progressive southern-portion
of the QLCS will likely spread across southern IN into early
evening. More broken, semi-discrete convection persists to its south
and these cells may help refine its southern edge along the IN/KY
border. The IND VWP indicates still adequate low-level SRH for a
supercell tornado. Most cells have struggled to more deeply
intensify despite the ample buoyancy, likely due to development
ahead of the weak surface front amid marginal mid-level lapse rates
and the MCV tracking towards northern IN. Sporadic severe wind gusts
should remain the primary hazard.

Mesoscale Discussion 1350
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0239 PM CDT Wed Jun 18 2025

Areas affected...Portions of southern Oklahoma into the eastern
South Plains of Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 181939Z - 182145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Large hail (isolated hail greater than 2 inches) and
severe wind gusts will be possible with storms developing on an
outflow boundary. The tornado threat is low, but nonzero,
conditional upon favorable storm interactions with the boundary. A
watch is possible for parts of Northwest Texas into southern
Oklahoma.

DISCUSSION...Surface observations and visible satellite over the
past several hours have indicated that an outflow boundary from
morning convection has slowly shifted north into southern Oklahoma
this afternoon. A weak surface low is also evident in far southwest
Oklahoma, very near the Red River. Given the amount of
destabilization that has occurred and the stronger convergence near
the surface low, it seems likely that a few storms will eventually
develop later this afternoon. With the upper-level trough moving
eastward, only modestly enhanced mid-level winds will remain. As
such, effective shear (30-35 kts) will only be marginally supportive
of supercells. However, steep mid-level lapse rates (7.8 C/km on the
18Z observed OUN sounding) and large buoyancy (3000+ J/kg MLCAPE)
will support a threat for large/very-large hail and severe wind
gusts. Coverage of hail greater than 2 inches may only be isolated
given weak anvil-level flow. The tornado threat appears low on
account of weak low-level winds, but a storm interacting with the
outflow boundary would be capable of tornado in that mesoscale
environment.

Mesoscale Discussion 1349
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0238 PM CDT Wed Jun 18 2025

Areas affected...northern IN...southern Lower MI...northwest OH

Concerning...Tornado Watch 434...

Valid 181938Z - 182145Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 434 continues.

SUMMARY...Northern, fast-moving portion of a QLCS should progress
across the rest of northern Indiana into southern Lower Michigan and
northwest Ohio through early evening. Damaging winds should be the
main threat, but a tornado or two will be possible. Downstream watch
issuance expected by 21Z.

DISCUSSION...The northern portion of a QLCS has been steadily
progressing east around 45 kts with a history of estimated to
measured gusts of 55-70 mph. This fast-moving portion of the line
has likely outpaced stronger low-level shear across southwest IN,
per comparison of VWX and IWX VWP data. Given largely veered surface
winds downstream and recent HRRR guidance, an outflow-dominated line
will likely persist as it spreads into southern Lower MI and
northwest OH through early evening. Damaging winds should remain the
primary hazard, with a tornado or two possible in any QLCS
mesovortices across northern IN.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 437
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
450 PM EDT Wed Jun 18 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southeast Indiana
  Northern Kentucky
  Southwest Ohio

* Effective this Wednesday afternoon and evening from 450 PM
  until 1000 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds likely with isolated significant gusts
    to 75 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...A fast moving line of thunderstorms over Indiana will
track eastward this afternoon and evening.  Damaging winds along the
leading edge of the storms is the primary risk.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 70
statute miles east and west of a line from 55 miles northwest of
Columbus OH to 45 miles south of Cincinnati OH. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update

Hurricane Erick Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052025
300 PM CST Wed Jun 18 2025

An Air Force Reconnaissance aircraft completed its mission into 
Erick this morning and found 93-kt flight-level winds at 700 mb 
along with a dropsonde central pressure of 971 mb around 17Z.  The 
recon data showed strengthening in between the 1530Z fix and the 17Z 
fix.  An eye has been present in visible and infrared satellite 
imagery since about 15Z this morning, and recent satellite imagery 
shows the eye continuing to become more circular with warming eye 
temperatures.  The eye is nearly completely surrounded by a large 
area of convective cloud tops colder than -70C.  As a result, 
satellite intensity estimates have been increasing quickly.  The 
18Z subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB range from 90-102 
kt.  Recent objective intensity estimates from UW-CIMSS are in the 
95-100 kt range.  Based on a blend of the data, the initial 
intensity is estimated to be 95 kt, and this might be a bit 
conservative.
 
The initial motion estimate is northwestward, or 315/8 kt.  This 
general motion, along with perhaps a slight acceleration, is 
expected through landfall, which is forecast to occur early Thursday 
morning along the southern coast of Mexico.  Erick has been moving 
to the right of the previous official forecast, and as a result, 
the new guidance shows landfall slightly to the east of the 
previous track.  The new NHC track forecast is shifted eastward, 
close to the latest TVCE and HCCA consensus aids.  Confidence in 
the track forecast is high.

Erick has been rapidly strengthening for the past 12 hours, and 
given the extremely favorable atmospheric and oceanic conditions 
along Erick's forecast track, further intensification in the short 
term appears very likely.  The 12Z HAFS models and the 18Z SHIPS 
guidance have Erick becoming a major hurricane soon.  The various 
SHIPS Rapid Intensification indices all show greater than a 70 
percent chance of 20 kt strengthening in the next 12 h.  The new 
NHC forecast shows 110 kt at 12 h, which is at the high end of the 
intensity guidance suite.  There is a possibility that Erick could 
strengthen more than forecast.

The next Air Force Reconnaissance aircraft is scheduled to be in 
the hurricane in a few hours, around 2330 UTC today.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Erick continues to rapidly intensify and is expected to be a 
major hurricane when it reaches the coast of western Oaxaca or 
eastern Guerrero within the hurricane warning area late tonight or 
early Thursday.  Devastating wind damage is possible where the core 
of the storm moves onshore.  Weather conditions are already 
deteriorating, and preparations to protect life and property should 
be rushed to completion before sunset.
 
2. Erick will produce heavy rainfall across portions of Central
America and Southwest Mexico through this week.  Life-threatening
flooding and mudslides are likely, especially in areas of steep
terrain.
 
3. A dangerous, life-threatening storm surge is expected to produce 
coastal flooding near and to the east of where the center crosses 
the coast, in areas of onshore winds.  The surge will be accompanied 
by large and destructive waves.

Interests elsewhere in southern Mexico should monitor the
progress of Erick.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 AM CST (1200 UTC), the center of Hurricane Erick was
located near latitude 13.5 North, longitude 95.7 West. Erick is
moving toward the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h). A northwestward
motion with a gradual increase in forward speed is expected later
today or tonight. On the forecast track, the center of Erick is
expected to approach the coast of southern Mexico late tonight and
move inland or be near the coast on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 75 mph (120 km/h) with higher
gusts. Rapid strengthening is expected today, and Erick may reach 
major hurricane strength when it approaches the coast of southern 
Mexico Thursday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 15 miles (30 km) from 
the center, and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 
miles (110 km) from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 991 mb (29.26 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Hurricane Erick can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header
WTPZ45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Erick will produce rainfall totals of 8 to 16 inches, with
maximum totals of 20 inches, across the Mexican states of Oaxaca and
Guerrero. This rainfall will lead to life-threatening flooding and
mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain. Rainfall totals of
3 to 5 inches, with maximum totals of 8 inches, are expected across
the Mexican states of Chiapas, Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Hurricane Erick, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are expected in the hurricane warning
area early Thursday and possible in the hurricane watch area on
Thursday. Tropical storm conditions are expected in the tropical
storm warning area later today and tonight.
 
STORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal
flooding near and to the east of where the center crosses the coast
in areas of onshore winds. The surge will be accompanied by large
and destructive waves.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Erick are expected to begin affecting the
coast of southern Mexico later today.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Erick Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052025
300 AM CST Wed Jun 18 2025
 
Satellite imagery indicates continued improvement in Erick’s 
structure, with deep convection wrapping tightly within the 
inner-core region. A recent AMSU microwave pass confirmed a 
better-organized inner core, consistent with the observed 
intensification trend. Although ASCAT data from several hours ago 
sampled about 40-kt peak winds in the northeastern quadrant, Erick 
has strengthened since that time. This is supported by the latest 
subjective Dvorak classifications of T3.5 from TAFB and T4.5 from 
SAB, while the objective ADT estimate from UW-CIMSS has increased to 
near 60 kt and continues to rise. Based on a blend of these data, 
the initial intensity is increased to 55 kt for this advisory.

Erick is moving northwestward at about 310/6 kt. This relatively 
slow forward motion has persisted for the past several hours, 
consistent with a weakening of the mid-level ridge to the north in 
response to a mid- to upper-level trough progressing eastward across 
the central United States. This general motion is expected to 
continue through landfall, which is forecast to occur early Thursday 
along the southern coast of Mexico. The track guidance remains in 
good agreement, and confidence in the overall track is relatively 
high. That said, small track deviations could still lead to 
significant changes in where and when the strongest winds and 
coastal impacts occur due to the oblique angle of approach. The 
official forecast aligns closely with the consensus of the HCCA and 
TVCE aids and remains near the previous NHC track.

The environment ahead of Erick remains highly conducive for 
additional strengthening, with sea surface temperatures near 29 C, 
low vertical wind shear, and abundant mid-level moisture. Several 
dynamic regional models project Erick to reach major hurricane 
strength before landfall, and the Rapid Intensification (RI) 
guidance continues to indicate a significant chance for rapid 
strengthening within the next 36 hours. The NHC forecast remains 
near the upper end of the guidance envelope but could still be 
somewhat conservative, especially if the current trend of improved 
structure continues today.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Erick is expected to rapidly intensify before reaching the coast
of southern Mexico on Thursday, and a hurricane warning is in effect
for portions of the coast of Oaxaca and Guerrero.
 
2. Erick will produce heavy rainfall across portions of Central 
America and Southwest Mexico through this week.  Life-threatening 
flooding and mudslides are likely, especially in areas of steep 
terrain.
 
3. A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal flooding
near and to the east of where the center crosses the coast, in
areas of onshore winds.

Mesoscale Discussion 1334
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0325 PM CDT Tue Jun 17 2025

Areas affected...Southeast Wyoming...southern Nebraska
Panhandle...Front Range into northeast Colorado

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 428...

Valid 172025Z - 172200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 428
continues.

SUMMARY...Severe wind gust potential increasing just east of the
I-25 corridor and along I-80 in southeast Wyoming and the Nebraska
Panhandle. How far east this activity can maintain intensity is not
clear.

DISCUSSION...Linear convection has increased in intensity east of
Cheyenne and along the I-25 corridor. The most organized wind
signal, per KCYS velocity data, is moving roughly along I-80 east of
Cheyenne. A 69 mph wind gusts was measured with this activity.
Additionally, KFTG is showing a modest increase in wind potential
just east of the I-25 corridor. Areas of the Nebraska Panhandle into
northeast Colorado did receive longer periods of insolation this
afternoon. Farther east, outflow from morning convection has
modified a small degree. While severe wind gusts will become more
probable in the short term, the eastward extent of this threat is
not clear given at least pockets of MLCIN remaining.

Tropical Storm Erick Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052025
300 PM CST Tue Jun 17 2025
 
Erick has continued to become better organized in visible satellite 
imagery, with an extended cloud band curling one revolution around 
the center.  However, there is also some evidence of a dry slot 
filtering into the circulation from the southeast, and possibly as 
a result, infrared cloud top temperatures in the band are not as 
cold as they could be.  Subjective Dvorak classifications have 
risen to T3.0/45 kt from TAFB and T3.5/55 kt from SAB, but the 
initial intensity is held conservatively at 45 kt since objective 
numbers are closest to the TAFB estimate.

The center appears to have turned northwestward (310 degrees) and 
is moving around 6 kt.  A mid-level ridge to the north of the 
cyclone, and a mid-/upper-level trough over northern Mexico, should 
keep Erick on a generally northwestward trajectory for the next 
couple of days, with a gradual increase in forward speed.  The NHC 
forecast track lies close to the HCCA and TVCE consensus aids, and 
it a little east of the previous prediction.  Because of the 
oblique angle of Erick's track relative to the coast, it is 
impossible to know exactly where the strongest winds might occur, 
but it is becoming increasingly likely that they will occur in the 
area of western Oaxaca or eastern Guerrero states.
 
Despite the current convective pattern, the environment of low wind 
shear, high mid-level moisture, and warm sea surface temperatures 
should still support rapid strengthening.  Erick also has the 
structure to enable rapid intensification, and it may only take 
mixing out some of the dry air for that process to begin.  Rapid 
intensification (RI) indices fell a little on this forecast cycle, 
mainly due to a negative contribution from the influx of drier 
boundary layer air.  However, assuming this dry air can mix out, 
the NHC intensity forecast continues to be near the high end of the 
guidance (closest to HCCA and HMON), and still shows Erick near or 
at major hurricane strength when it approaches the coast of 
southern Mexico.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Erick is expected to rapidly intensify before reaching the coast
of southern Mexico on Thursday, and a hurricane warning is in effect 
for portions of the coast of Oaxaca.  A hurricane watch is in effect 
for portions of the Guerrero coast.
 
2. Erick will produce heavy rainfall across portions of Central 
America and Southwest Mexico through this week.  Life-threatening 
flooding and mudslides are possible, especially in areas of steep 
terrain.
 
3. A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce coastal flooding
near and to the east of where the center crosses the coast, in
areas of onshore winds.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM CST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Erick was
located near latitude 12.9 North, longitude 94.4 West.  Erick is
moving toward the northwest near 7 mph (11 km/h).  A northwestward 
motion with a gradual increase in forward speed is expected over 
the next couple of days.  On the forecast track, the center of Erick 
is expected to approach the coast of southern Mexico Wednesday 
night and move inland or be near the coast on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 50 mph (85 km/h) with higher gusts.
Rapid strengthening is forecast during the next day or two, and 
Erick is expected to become a hurricane by tonight or early 
Wednesday.  Erick is forecast to be near or at major hurricane 
strength when it approaches the coast of southern Mexico Wednesday 
night and Thursday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1001 mb (29.56 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Erick can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header
WTPZ45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Erick could produce rainfall totals of 8 to
16 inches, with maximum totals of 20 inches, across the Mexican
states of Oaxaca and Guerrero. This rainfall may produce life
threatening flooding and mudslides, especially in areas of steep
terrain. Rainfall totals of 3 to 5 inches, with maximum totals of 8
inches, are possible across the Mexican states of Chiapas,
Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 600 AM CST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Erick was
located near latitude 12.1 North, longitude 93.8 West.  Erick is
moving toward the west-northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h).  A slower
west-northwest to northwest motion is expected during the next few
days.  On the forecast track, the system is expected to approach the
coast of southern Mexico Wednesday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher
gusts. Strengthening is forecast, and the system is expected to
become a hurricane on Wednesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Erick can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP5 and WMO header
WTPZ45 KNHC.
 
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Erick could produce rainfall totals of 5 to
10 inches, with maximum totals of 15 inches, across the Mexican
states of Chiapas, Oaxaca, and Guerrero and coastal sections of
Guatemala.  This rainfall may produce life-threatening flooding and
mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain.
 
Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches, with maximum totals of 6 inches
are possible across interior portions of Southeast Mexico, El
Salvador, interior Guatemala and the Mexican states of Chiapas,
Tabasco and Veracruz.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Storm Erick, please see the National Weather Service Storm
Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep5.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible in the hurricane watch area
by Wednesday night.  Tropical storm conditions are possible in the
tropical storm watch area by late Wednesday.
 
STORM SURGE: Storm surge could produce coastal flooding near where
the center crosses the coast in areas of onshore winds.  The surge
will be accompanied by large and destructive waves.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Erick are expected to begin affecting the
coast of southern Mexico in a day or so.  These swells are likely to
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Erick Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052025
300 AM CST Tue Jun 17 2025

Satellite imagery shows that the system is gradually becoming 
better organized.  TAFB determined a Dvorak data T-number of T2.5 
which is confirmed from a spiral banding measurement of roughly a 
0.5 wrap on enhanced IR images.  Therefore, the intensity estimate 
is set at 35 kt for this advisory, and the cyclone is being named.

Based on the latest center fixes, the motion remains 300/10 kt, as 
in the previous advisory.  A mid-level ridge to the north of the 
storm is forecast to weaken a bit by the global models, and this 
should result in a west-northwestward to northwestward motion at a 
slower forward speed.  The track guidance is in fairly good 
agreement and similar to the previous model runs.  It should 
be noted that the complexity of the track moving parallel to the 
coast of southern Mexico means that small changes in the system's 
heading will cause substantial differences in where and when the 
most significant wind impacts will occur.  The official track 
forecast is close to the various consensus solutions including the 
FSU Superensemble.  Users are reminded that the average 60-hour NHC 
track error is a little more than 60 n mi.

Erick is situated in an atmospheric and oceanic environment which 
appears to be very conducive for strengthening, with low shear, 
water temperatures near 29 deg C and mid-tropospheric humidities of 
75-80 percent.  The official intensity forecast is a little higher 
than the previous one, but some of the numerical guidance shows 
even more strengthening than that.  Moreover, the various Rapid 
Intensification (RI) indices show a significant chance for RI 
before landfall.  Thus, the NHC forecast for the peak strength of 
Erick could be conservative.

 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. Erick is expected to strengthen significantly before 
reaching the coast of southern Mexico, where a Hurricane Watch is 
in effect.
 
2. Erick will likely produce heavy rainfall across portions of 
Central America and southern Mexico through this week. 
Life-threatening flooding and mudslides are possible, especially in
areas of steep terrain.
 
3. A storm surge could produce coastal flooding near where the 
center crosses the coast.

Potential Tropical Cyclone Five-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP052025
300 PM CST Mon Jun 16 2025
 
Showers and thunderstorms associated with a broad area of low 
pressure located a couple of hundred miles south of the coast of 
Guatemala have increased in organization over the past couple of 
days.  Visible satellite imagery shows an exposed elongated 
low-level center south of a burst of modest convective activity.  
The initial intensity is set to 30 kt based on a partial overpass of 
satellite scatterometer data.  Since the system is expected to 
develop and affect southern Mexico late Wednesday or Thursday, 
advisories have been initiated on Potential Tropical Cyclone Five.

The initial motion is estimated to be 295/7 kt, but this is 
uncertain due to the lack of a defined core.  The low is moving 
along the western periphery of a ridge centered over the 
southwestern Atlantic, and this feature should control the motion of 
the system for the entirety of the forecast period.  Most global and 
regional models predict the low will turn toward the northwest later 
today or tonight, and that motion should persist for the next few 
days.  There is noticeable spread in the along-track speed of the 
system among the various models.  The GFS and some of the regional 
models show a slower motion while the ECMWF and HCCA anticipate a 
quicker forward speed.  The NHC forecast track lies closest to a 
blend of the GFS and the ECMWF, near the center of the guidance 
envelope.

The low should remain over an area of very warm waters and within a 
conducive environment for strengthening.  SHIPS-EC shows a 50 
percent chance of 55 kt of strengthening in 48 hr, which highlights 
the possibility of rapid intensification in the coming days.  The 
official forecast predicts the disturbance will become a tropical 
storm in about a day and a hurricane in a couple of days.  The NHC 
forecast lies near the higher end of the intensity guidance 
envelope.  This system is expected to bring significant winds upon 
landfall in southern Mexico in the next few days or so.  However, it 
is important to note that uncertainty remains high in the exact 
location of potential impacts, and interests in southern Mexico 
should closely monitor the latest forecasts.  

NHC now has the ability to issue tropical cyclone advisory products 
for Potential Tropical Cyclones up to 72 hours before the 
anticipated arrival of tropical-storm-force winds on land when 
confidence is high that there is a significant risk of wind or storm 
surge impacts to land, regardless of the immediate need for 
land-based hurricane or tropical storm watches or warnings,   
Previously, Potential Tropical Cyclone advisories could be issued up 
to 48 hours beforehand.   Appropriate watches and warnings will 
still be issued 48 and 36 hours, respectively, before the onset of 
tropical-storm-force winds.

KEY MESSAGES:

1. The disturbance is expected to become a tropical storm on Tuesday 
and quickly strengthen into a hurricane by Wednesday as it 
approaches southern Mexico.  Hurricane watches will likely be 
required for portions of southern Mexico tonight or early Tuesday.. 

2. The system will likely produce heavy rainfall across portions of 
Central America and southern Mexico through this week.  
Life-threatening flooding and mudslides are possible, especially in 
areas of steep terrain.

Mesoscale Discussion 1314
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0349 PM CDT Mon Jun 16 2025

Areas affected...east-central to northern MN

Concerning...Tornado Watch 423...

Valid 162049Z - 162215Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 423 continues.

SUMMARY...The severe threat should increase into early evening as
additional storms develop southward in central Minnesota and spread
east.

DISCUSSION...Initially low-topped convection has gradually deepened
over the past hour. Cells near the surface cyclone in west-central
MN have mainly had a brief tornado threat thus far. But an arcing
line of towering CU towards Willmar ahead of the surface cold front
suggests additional storms should form into the instability axis
characterized by moderate buoyancy with MLCAPE of 1500-2500 J/kg.
This activity should intensify into early evening and support a more
sustained severe threat beyond brief tornadoes. The overall severe
threat may peak into early evening with any sustained supercells
that can interact with residual outflow from storms that have spread
into west-central WI. MPX VWP data has sampled enhanced low-level
SRH near this outflow.

Mesoscale Discussion 1313
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Mon Jun 16 2025

Areas affected...Parts of southern Montana into far northern Wyoming

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 161953Z - 162200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Widely scattered storms are possible southern
Montana/northern Wyoming. Supercells capable of large hail and
severe winds are expected. Though timing is uncertain, a watch is
possible this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Modestly moist upslope flow and an approaching
mid-level trough have promoted thunderstorm development within the
terrain of south-central Montana. This has occurred north of a band
of cirrus over much of Wyoming. While these storms have been slow to
intensify, continued surface heating this afternoon will increase
MLCAPE values to over 1000 J/kg. Effective shear of 45-55 kts will
help to organize convection into supercells capable of large hail
and severe wind gusts. Even with the approaching trough, mid-level
height falls will generally remain neutral until later in the
evening. It is not clear what storm coverage will be, but at least
widely scattered storms are possible with additional development
occurring in northern Wyoming near the Big Horns. Another point of
uncertainty is how far south/east activity will go given greater
inhibition underneath the cirrus canopy.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 423
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
255 PM CDT Mon Jun 16 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Central Minnesota
  Western Wisconsin

* Effective this Monday afternoon and evening from 255 PM until
  900 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter likely
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will intensify this afternoon near a cold
front sweeping eastward across the Minnesota, with a few supercells
expected.  Large hail is the main concern, but the strongest storms
may also pose a risk of damaging winds and a few tornadoes.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 70 statute miles
north and south of a line from 20 miles west of Alexandria MN to 80
miles northeast of Minneapolis MN. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU3).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean
storm motion vector 27030.

Mesoscale Discussion 1304
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0349 PM CDT Sun Jun 15 2025

Areas affected...eastern Wyoming into eastern Colorado

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 152049Z - 152245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms expected to increase in coverage with
potential for large hail and damaging wind.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm activity continues to increase, mainly
along and near the higher terrain/upslope regions, across the Front
Range into portions of eastern Wyoming. The downstream air mass
remains under the influence of strong MLCIN, albeit gradually
weakening along the western fringe. This weakening trend is set to
continue as forcing for ascent increases with a shortwave passage
this afternoon/evening. 

Thunderstorms are likely to form and quickly cluster this evening.
Once uncapped, the downstream air mass is moderately to very
unstable (with MLCAPE around 2000-3500 J/kg). Initially, supercells
capable of large hail and damaging wind will be the main threat
before a transition to linear bowing segments and focus for
potential damaging wind into portions of Nebraska. In the short
term, In addition, deepening cumulus is observed further east across
Cherry County in Nebraska. A supercell or two could emerge within
this region ahead of the main forcing. A watch will likely be needed
to cover these potential threats in the coming hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 1303
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0344 PM CDT Sun Jun 15 2025

Areas affected...Southeast Colorado into eastern New Mexico and far
West Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 152044Z - 152245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Large hail and severe wind gusts are possible with storms
that move off the terrain into southeast Colorado and eastern New
Mexico. A watch is not expected in the short term, but trends will
be monitored into the evening where a more organized wind threat
could evolve farther east.

DISCUSSION...Convection has developed from the Sangre de Cristo into
the southern Rockies this afternoon as moderately moist (mid 50s F
dewpoints) upslope flow has persisted over the last few hours. To
the east, a modifying outflow boundary from an earlier MCS in the
southern Plains has entered eastern New Mexico and should eventually
reach the terrain. While this outflow is slightly cooler, low 60s F
dewpoints have promoted 2000-2500 J/kg MLCAPE with weaker
inhibition. The expectation is for storms to eventually move off the
terrain as MLCIN is eroded in the next hour or two. Modestly
enhanced northwesterlies aloft on the western flank of the MCV atop
southeasterly surface winds supports 35-45 kts of effective shear
(stronger in the north and weaker south). Steep mid-level lapse
rates and strong shear should allow initial supercells to produce
large hail (up to 2.5 inches) as well as severe winds.

Some model guidance has suggested clustering is possible in
northeast New Mexico where stronger shear and greater buoyancy will
overlap. With only a weak low-level jet response in the Texas
Panhandle/South Plains this evening, it is not clear how far east
such a cluster/small MCS could propagate. A greater wind threat
would exist if this occurs. Overall, storm coverage should remain
isolated at least into early evening and a watch is not currently
expected. Trends in convective evolution will need to be monitored
into this evening, however.

terrain in central Montana. This should increased in coverage as a
shortwave rotates out of Idaho into Montana this afternoon/evening
and forcing for ascent increases.

Initially, the moderately unstable and strongly sheared air mass
should support supercells. Given the steep lapse rates and linear
elongated hodographs, these will be capable of large to very large
hail (2-3+ in). Where east to southeasterly flow resides in
east-central/eastern Montana leading to sufficient low level SRH, a
tornado would be possible. 

Evolution through the afternoon should favor clustering and attempts
at upscale growth, to which the primary hazard will likely become
strong to significant damaging wind (some 60-75+ mph). A Severe
Thunderstorm Watch will be needed to cover this threat within the
next couple of hours.

Tropical Storm Dalila Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042025
200 PM MST Sun Jun 15 2025
 
Dalila's convection has collapsed, leaving behind a single
fragmented band of thunderstorms.  Subjective and objective
satellite estimates have lowered this cycle and the initial
intensity has been reduced to 40 kt based on a blend of the TAFB and
SAB Dvorak estimates. Dalila is expected to continue weakening as
the storm moves over cooler waters and into a hostile environment.
The NHC intensity forecast predicts Dalila to become a post-tropical
remnant low later today.
 
The storm is moving west-northwestward at 8 kt and should continue
gradually turning westward in the low-level flow. A more westward
motion is expected in the next day or two until the system
dissipates in a couple of days.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 200 PM MST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Dalila was
located near latitude 18.2 North, longitude 108.4 West. Dalila is
moving toward the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). A gradual
turn towards the west will occur later today, with a continued
westward motion the next couple of days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 45 mph (75 km/h) with
higher gusts. Steady weakening is forecast the during the next
couple of days, and the system is expected to become a remnant low
later tonight.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1002 mb (29.59 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF: Swells generated by Tropical Storm Dalila will affect portions
of the coast of southwestern Mexico today. These swells are likely
to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 418
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
215 PM MDT Sun Jun 15 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central and eastern Montana
  North central Wyoming

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 215 PM until
  1100 PM MDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 80
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 3
    inches in diameter likely
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected to increase in coverage and
intensity through the afternoon while spreading eastward from the
higher terrain.  The storm environment initially favors supercells
with very large hail (2-3 inch diameter), while upscale growth into
clusters is expected this evening with an increasing threat for
60-80 mph outflow winds.  Favorable storm interactions could also
support an isolated tornado or two this evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 100
statute miles north and south of a line from 30 miles west of
Harlowton MT to 10 miles east northeast of Baker MT. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
3 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 70 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean storm motion vector
27020.

Tropical Storm Dalila Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042025
200 AM MST Sun Jun 15 2025
 
Dalila is likely near its peak intensity, with little change in
organization evident since the previous advisory package. The latest
subjective Dvorak intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB were 65
knots and 55 knots, respectively. Objective estimates ranged from
45 to 57 knots, while an ASCAT pass earlier in the day showed
numerous 50 knot wind barbs. Based on a blend of these data, the
initial intensity for this advisory has been held at 55 knots.
 
Dalila is now heading toward the west-northwest, or 285/12 knots. A
turn toward the west is expected during the next day or so, as 
Dalila is steered by a mid-level ridge over northern Mexico and the 
southwest U.S. A westward to slightly south of due west motion is 
then forecast through dissipation as Dalila moves over much
cooler waters. The current forecast shows Dalila becoming a
post-tropical remnant low in a day or so, and dissipating by 
Tuesday. The latest track forecast is very close to that of the 
previous advisory, and is close to the track consensus aids.

Dalila should begin to weaken later today as some drier mid-level
air evident in water vapor imagery begins to impact the system.  
More steady weakening is then likely as the system moves
over much cooler water and into a progressively drier mid-level
environment. The latest intensity forecast is close to the previous
advisory and in good agreement with the intensity consensus
guidance.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The outer bands of Tropical Storm Dalila will bring locally heavy 
rainfall to the Mexican states of Michoacán and Guerrero through 
this morning. Scattered areas of flooding and mudslides are 
expected, especially in areas of steep terrain near the coast.
 
2. Dalila is expected to produce tropical-storm-force winds across
portions of the warning area during the next few hours.  Winds 
will diminish today while the system moves farther offshore of the 
coast of southwestern Mexico.

Mesoscale Discussion 1288
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0353 PM CDT Sat Jun 14 2025

Areas affected...Northeast Alabama into North Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 142053Z - 142300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Locally damaging winds may occur with marginally organized
bands of convection. Storms are expected to weaken around sunset.

DISCUSSION...A belt of modestly stronger mid-level winds is evident
on regional VAD data near a weakening trough in the mid Ohio Valley.
With strong daytime heating of a moist (low 70s F dewpoints)
airmass, around 2000 J/kg MLCAPE has developed this afternoon. A few
clusters of storms have become marginally organized this afternoon.
A recent observed gust of 44 kts at the Rome, GA ASOS suggests
near-severe/potentially damaging gusts are possible with this
activity. As daytime heating wanes, storms should gradually decrease
in intensity by sunset.

Mesoscale Discussion 1287
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0259 PM CDT Sat Jun 14 2025

Areas affected...Parts of western/southwest Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 141959Z - 142200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Observational trends suggest some potential for storm
development in western/southwestern Oklahoma. While initiation is
still not certain, all severe hazards would be possible. Trends will
continue to be monitored.

DISCUSSION...With the stronger convection moving out of eastern
Oklahoma into western Arkansas, the outflow across central Oklahoma
has only been weakly reinforced through the afternoon. Notable
airmass recovery has occurred along the southwestern/western flank
of this outflow. Over the past hour or so, cumulus have continued to
deepen in parts of southwest and western Oklahoma. Given weak
forcing aloft, it is not clear parcels will be able to remain in the
zone of ascent long enough to reach their LFC. However, if
initiation occurs, the environment would support severe storms.

Mid-level winds are enhanced on the southwestern flank of an MCV
near the KS/OK border, promoting around 30 kts of effective shear.
Storms would likely be supercellular. Large hail (potentially to
around 2 inches) and severe winds would be possible. Significant
hail would likely be isolated given fairly weak upper-level winds.
Given the backed southeasterly surface winds and favorable storm
mode, a tornado would also be possible. Forecast soundings and the
KTLX VAD suggest sufficient low-level SRH.

Given the uncertainties in this scenario, a watch is not currently
expected in the short term. However, one would be possible should
confidence in initiation increase.

  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...A few thunderstorm clusters, and potentially a couple of
supercells, are expected to form and spread eastward from eastern
Wyoming into the Nebraska Panhandle and adjacent parts of far
southwest South Dakota and northeast Colorado through late evening. 
Large hail of 1-2 inches in diameter and severe outflow gusts of
60-70 mph will be the main threats.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles east and west of a line from 25 miles north northeast
of Gillette WY to 60 miles southwest of Sidney NE. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM CST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Dalila was
located near latitude 16.8 North, longitude 105.5 West. Dalila is
moving toward the west-northwest near 10 mph (17 km/h). A gradual
westward turn is expected later tonight into Sunday. On the forecast 
track, the center of Dalila is forecast to remain offshore the 
southwestern coast of Mexico.
 
Recent satellite-derived wind data indicate that maximum sustained
winds have increased to near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher gusts.  
Dalila is likely near its peak intensity and will gradually begin 
to weaken by Sunday. 
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles (240 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 993 mb (29.33 inches).

Tropical Storm Dalila Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042025
300 PM CST Sat Jun 14 2025
 
Deep convection continues to burst over the center of Dalila, with 
cold cloud tops near -80 C and a well-defined convective band shown 
in satellite imagery. A recent scatterometer pass showed peak winds 
near 55 kt, which prompted an increase in the estimated intensity to 
55 kt during the intermediate advisory. Since then, the convective 
structure has remained steady, and with both objective and 
subjective satellite intensity estimates continuing to support this 
intensity, thus, the initial intensity is held at 55 kt for this 
advisory.

The initial motion is estimated at 300/9 kt. The storm is expected 
to continue moving toward the west-northwest into tonight, then 
begin turning toward the west by Sunday as the mid- to upper-level 
ridge continues to strengthen to the north. The forecast guidance 
remains in good agreement with this scenario, and the new forecast 
track is close to the various consensus models and is similar to the 
previous NHC forecast.

Dalila has likely reached its peak intensity and the storm may 
maintain its current strength for a few more hours. By Sunday, the 
storm will begin moving over cooler waters and into a drier, more 
stable environment, which will initiate a weakening trend. The 
system is forecast to become a remnant low in 48 hours, then 
dissipate into an open trough in 72 hours. The NHC intensity 
forecast closely follows a blend of the statistical-dynamical 
guidance and is very similar to the previous forecast.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The outer bands of Tropical Storm Dalila will bring locally heavy 
rainfall to the Mexican states of Michoacán and Guerrero through 
Sunday morning. Scattered areas of flooding and mudslides are 
expected, especially in areas of steep terrain near the coast.
 
2. Dalila is expected to produce tropical-storm-force winds across
portions of the warning area today.

Mesoscale Discussion 1283
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0733 AM CDT Sat Jun 14 2025

Areas affected...parts of south central and southeastern
Kansas...north central and northeastern Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 141233Z - 141430Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Potential for strong to severe wind gusts may continue
with thunderstorm outflow overspreading the central Kansas/Oklahoma
border vicinity during the next couple of hours.  But this seems
likely to diminish, as thunderstorms begin to weaken, while
approaching the Greater Tulsa vicinity toward mid to late morning.

DISCUSSION...The more intense thunderstorm development is being
maintained above the stronger leading edge of the consolidated
convective cold pool, now east and southeast of the Great Bend and
Medicine Lodge KS vicinities, where 2 hourly surface pressure rises
as high as 3+ mb have recently been observed.  A swath of rear
inflow on the order of 40-60+ kt has been evident in radar data,
mostly in the 2-5 km AGL layer, but measured surface gusts appear to
have mostly remained below severe limits.

This has been propagating southeastward around 30 kt, and could
approach the Tulsa OK vicinity by 15-16Z.  However, due to the
potential stabilizing impacts of downstream convection on the
southeasterly updraft inflow, it remains unclear how much longer
vigorous convective development will be maintained.  As this
weakens, the risk for strong to severe wind gusts is likely to
subsequently diminish as well.

Tropical Storm Dalila Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP042025
300 AM CST Sat Jun 14 2025
 
Dalila has become better organized early this morning, with the 
latest satellite images showing well defined convective banding 
around the low-level center. The latest subjective Dvorak intensity 
estimates from TAFB and SAB were T3.5/55 knots and T3.0/45 knots. 
Objective estimates ranged from 34 to 43 knots, while a recent ASCAT 
pass showed several wind barbs close to 40 kt. Based on a blend of 
these data and taking into account the potential for some 
under-sampling in ASCAT, the initial intensity for this advisory has 
been increased to 45 knots.
 
Dalila is heading toward the northwest, or 305/10 knots. A turn
toward the west-northwest is expected later today as the system
moves along the southern periphery of a building mid-level ridge
over northern Mexico and the southwest U.S. A gradual turn toward
the west is expected tonight and Sunday, as Dalila moves over cooler
water and becomes increasingly steered by the low-level trade wind
flow. A westward motion is then forecast to continue through
dissipation Monday night, and this may be generous as Dalila may not
survive that long. The track forecast lies nearly on top of the
previous track and is in close agreement with the latest consensus
guidance.
 
There is a limited window for Dalila to strengthen as it will remain
over warm water and light to moderate effective easterly shear
today. The forecast calls for some strengthening today, and the peak
intensity was nudged slightly higher to better align with the latest
intensity model trends. Beginning tonight the system will cross the
26C isotherm and over progressively cooler water, and this is
expected to begin the weakening phase with Dalila forecast to become
a post-tropical remnant low Sunday night, and possibly sooner than
that. The latest intensity forecast close to the middle of the
intensity guidance envelope through the forecast period.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The outer bands of Tropical Storm Dalila will bring locally heavy
rainfall to the Mexican states of Guerrero, Michoacán, and Colima
through Sunday morning. Scattered areas of flooding and mudslides
are expected, especially in areas of steep terrain near the coast.
 
2. Dalila is expected to produce tropical-storm-force winds across
portions of the warning area tonight and Saturday.
