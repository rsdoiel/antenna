Norway’s full-year EV sales are in, and once again the country has
broken its own record for EV adoption. In 2024, 88.9% of cars sold in
Norway were all-electric, up from 82.4% in 2023.
</p>
<p>
The main holdout? Rental car companies, who service tourists who aren’t
familiar with EVs.

<p>
Puerto Rico kicked off 2025 with a harsh reminder of its fragile power
grid. On New Year’s Eve, nearly the entire island – 90% – lost
electricity, leaving over 1.3 million customers in the dark during
holiday celebrations. Power was restored on January 1, but the blackout
underscored an urgent need for reliable energy solutions.
</p>
<p>
In a move to help bolster Puerto Rico’s grid resilience, Convergent
Energy and Power secured a conditional commitment from the US Department
of Energy (DOE) Loan Programs Office for a massive solar and battery
storage initiative
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/lpo-announces-conditional-commitment-subsidiaries-convergent-energy-and-power-inc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in
December</a>. The DOE’s backing includes up to $559.4 million in loan
guarantees, paving the way for Convergent to install both solar and
standalone battery systems across the island.

<p>
California has led the nation in electric bicycle adoption, helping more
people than ever before switch away from cars and toward smaller and
more efficient transportation alternatives. However, the proliferation
of electric bicycles has also led to a major uptick in higher-power
models that have flouted established e-bike laws, often being used on
public roads and bike paths to the chagrin of many local residents.
</p>
<p>
A new law that came into effect this week has now further clarified
which electric bicycles are street-legal and which fall afoul of
regulations.

state. Chief among them is a clarification of the three-class e-bike
system, which is likely to now rule that many of the throttle-enabled
electric bikes currently available and on the road in California will no
longer be street legal.

We don’t want to sound alarmist,
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/11/14/which-electric-vehicles-qualify-us-federal-tax-credit-ev-2024/">but
it sure looks like President-elect Donald Trump and his billionaire
buddies are plotting to kill federal EV tax credits somewhat sooner than
later</a> – and the tariffs they’re promising aren’t going to make cars
cheaper anytime soon, either. So if you’re in the market for a new EV,
the time is now to score a sweet 0% financing deal and get those tax
credits
(<a href="https://www.instagram.com/electrek.co/reel/DCjVmEnOFLG/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">while
you still can</a>).
</p>
<p>
<strong>UPDATE</strong>: we’ve got a few new additions for the closing
days of 2024, including sweet deals on the Mustang Mach-E GT (above),
Toyota bZ4X, and more!
