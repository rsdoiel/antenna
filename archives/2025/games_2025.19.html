<p>Back in January, New York-based animation distributor GKIDS made the
exciting announcement that it’s bringing Mamoru Hosoda’s library of
anime films back to digital and home video release in America, including
in 4K UHD editions. That was a fantastic relief for fans of ambitious,
intelligently made anime movies. Hosoda’s latest movies, including
