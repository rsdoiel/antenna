<p><strong>rekt</strong>, Alex Gonzalez (Erewhon Books 978-1645661597, hardcover, 368pp, $28.00) March 2025</p>
<p>Here comes another startling debut novel to give us all hope for the future of the field in the hands of a new generation of writers. But unlike <b>Sleeping Worlds Have No Memory</b>, another recent standout premiere, this book is not conducted in a ‚Äúcivilized,‚Äù literary, cultured manner.
