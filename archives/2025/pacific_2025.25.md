## Argentina’s ex-President Kirchner, under house arrest, plots political fight-back – from her balcony

date: 2025-06-24, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>BUENOS AIRES &#8212; On a Buenos Aires residential street, two protesters painted a telling image in colorful strokes: a portrait of a lone woman on her balcony overlooking a mass of people below. The figure was one of Argentina&#8217;s most prominent politicians in the last two decades - leading opposition leader and former first lady and two-time president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who was put under house arrest last week in a six-year sentence for corruption. It means the end of a political career &#8212; at least formally &#8212; for the 72-year-old, a divisive populist whose big government model is now being dismantled by the &#8220;chainsaw&#8221; austerity of libertarian President Javier Milei. The sentence also bans Kirchner, who had announced plans to run for Buenos Aires province&#8217;s legislature, from public office.</p>

## Tankers U-turn, zig-zag, pause around Strait of Hormuz

date: 2025-06-24, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>SINGAPORE/LONDON &#8212; At least two supertankers made U-turns near the Strait of Hormuz following U.S. military strikes on Iran, shiptracking data shows, as more than a week of violence in the region prompts vessels to speed, pause, or alter their journeys. Washington&#8217;s decision to join Israel&#8217;s attacks on Iran has stoked fears that Iran could retaliate by closing the strait between Iran and Oman through which around 20% of global oil and gas demand flows. That has spurred forecasts of oil surging to $100 a barrel. Both Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude hit fresh five-month highs on Monday in choppy trade as investors weighed the potential risks to supply.</p>

## 36 hours in East London

date: 2025-06-22, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>There is no better time to visit East London than in the summer. From May to September, Londoners emerge to sip canned cocktails in parks, languish by the boats on Regent&#8217;s Canal and pick over tchotchkes at outdoor markets. But there is plenty of fun to be had inside, too. The area, which was included in The New York Times&#8217; 52 Places to Go in 2025, has undergone a cultural makeover in the years after the 2012 Olympics. Olympic Park, built on a former brownfield site in the district of Stratford, gained a dance theater and an outpost of the Victoria and Albert Museum this year. And the Soho Theater has opened a branch in Walthamstow, an area about 40 minutes from central London. A lot of this itinerary takes place in the many neighborhoods that make up the borough of Hackney, including Dalston, Shoreditch and Hoxton. The neighborhoods are magnets for the more trend-conscious and easily memed set, but there are places where you can still glimpse the area&#8217;s industrial roots and vibrant immigrant communities. It is the balance between old and new, established and evolving that makes East London hum.</p>
