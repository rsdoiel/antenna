<p>Matthew Prince (Hacker News, Slashdot): The problem is whether you
create content to sell ads, sell subscriptions, or just to know that
people value what you’ve created, an AI-driven web doesn’t reward
content creators the way that the old search-driven web did. And that
means the deal that Google made to take content in exchange […]</p>

by Claude</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-02, updated: 2025-07-02, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/ba1e9fa26fc8af08934d7bc0805b9b80">Mandelbrot
in x86 assembly by Claude</a></strong>
</p>
Inspired by
<a href="https://twitter.com/russnelson/status/1940144705192542369">a
tweet</a> asking if Claude knew x86 assembly, I decided to run a bit of
an experiment.
</p>
<p>
I prompted Claude Sonnet 4:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>Write me an ascii art mandelbrot fractal generator in x86
assembly</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And
<a href="https://claude.ai/share/abda7710-16f8-4d6d-9012-6b342fff175c">got
back code</a> that looked… like assembly code I guess?
</p>
<p>
So I copied some jargon out of that response and asked:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>I have some code written for x86-64 assembly using NASM syntax,
targeting Linux (using system calls for output).</code>
</p>
<p>
<code>How can I run that on my Mac?</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That
<a href="https://claude.ai/share/27107b9a-f40e-4f81-9348-5944a3c4e82f">gave
me a Dockerfile</a>.
</p>
<p>
I tried running it on my Mac and… it failed to compile.
</p>
<p>
So I fired up Claude Code (with the
<code>–dangerously-skip-permissions</code> option) in that directory and
told it what to run:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>Run this: docker build -t myasm .</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It started crunching. It read the errors, inspected the assembly code,
made changes, tried running it again in a loop, added more comments…
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Terminal window showing code diff for Mandelbrot fractal program. • Now I need to fix the Mandelbrot iteration logic as well. The current fixed-point arithmetic has issues: • Read(program.asm) └ Read 30 lines (Ctrl+r to expand) • The Mandelbrot iteration logic also has issues with fixed-point arithmetic. Let me fix this too: • Update(program.asm) └ Updated program.asm with 18 additions and 12 removals showing assembly code diff with line numbers 63-91, including removed lines marked in red for fixed point multiplication calculations and added lines in green with 64-bit arithmetic conversions, comments describing z_real and z_imag calculations, and mandel_done logic checks." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/claude-code-x86.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
…and eventually produced an ASCII art image of a fractal! Claude Code
proudly declared:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Success! The Docker container ran and generated a Mandelbrot set
visualization using ASCII characters. The output shows all @ symbols,
which indicates the algorithm is working but all points are inside the
set (high iteration count). The program compiled and executed
successfully on x86_64 architecture via emulation.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yeah… I was not satisfied with an image that was entirely @ symbols! I
said:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>That is a bad result - it is just @ signs, I cannot see the
fractal</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Claude made a few more changes and gave me the result I wanted:

<p>

<h2 id="til-using-playwright-mcp-with-claude-code">TIL: Using Playwright
MCP with Claude Code</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-01, updated: 2025-07-01, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/claude-code/playwright-mcp-claude-code">TIL:
Using Playwright MCP with Claude Code</a></strong>
</p>
Inspired
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/29/agentic-coding/">by
Armin</a> (“I personally use only one MCP - I only use Playwright”) I
decided to figure out how to use the official
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp">Playwright MCP
server</a> with
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude-code/">Claude Code</a>.
</p>
<p>
It turns out it’s easy:
</p>
<pre><code>claude mcp add playwright npx '@playwright/mcp@latest'
claude
</code></pre>
<p>
The <code>claude mcp add</code> command only affects the current
directory by default - it gets persisted in the
<code>~/.claude.json</code> file.
</p>
<p>
Now Claude can use Playwright to automate a Chrome browser! Tell it to
“Use playwright mcp to open a browser to example.com” and watch it go -
it can navigate pages, submit forms, execute custom JavaScript and take
screenshots to feed back into the LLM.
</p>
<p>
<p>The browser window stays visible which means you can interact with it

<h2 id="planetscales-classy-retirement">PlanetScale’s classy
retirement</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-01, updated: 2025-07-01, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
Sometimes a service with a free plan will decide to stop supporting it.
I understand why this happens, but I’m often disappointed at the
treatment of existing user’s data. It’s easy to imagine users forgetting
about their old accounts, missing the relevant emails and then
discovering too late that their data is gone.
</p>
<p>
Inspired by today’s news
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/1/planetscale-for-postgres/">about
PlanetScale PostgreSQL</a> I signed into PlanetScale and found I had a
long-forgotten trial account there with a three-year-old database on
their free tier. That free tier was retired
<a href="https://planetscale.com/blog/planetscale-forever">in March
2024</a>.
</p>
<p>
Here’s the screen that greeted me in their control panel:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Database is sleeping PlanetScale has retired the free plan. Please upgrade your plan or you may wake this database for 24 hours to retrieve your data. Two buttons: Wake for 24 hours and Delete database" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/planetscale-retire.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
What a great way to handle retiring a free plan! My data is still there,
and I have the option to spin up a database for 24 hours to help get it
back out again.

<p>date: 2025-07-01, updated: 2025-07-01, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
Using LLMs for <strong>code archaeology</strong> is pretty fun.
</p>
<p>
I stumbled across
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2003/Jul/17/phpAndColdFusion/">this
blog entry from 2003</a> today, in which I had gotten briefly excited
about ColdFusion and implemented an experimental PHP template engine
that used XML tags to achieve a similar effect:
</p>
<pre>&lt;<span class="pl-ent">h1</span>&gt;%title%&lt;/<span class="pl-ent">h1</span>&gt;
&lt;<span class="pl-ent">sql</span> <span class="pl-e">id</span>=<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>recent<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>&gt;
select title
from entries 
order by added desc
limit 0, %limit%
&lt;/<span class="pl-ent">sql</span>&gt;
&lt;<span class="pl-ent">ul</span>&gt;
  &lt;<span class="pl-ent">output</span> <span class="pl-e">sql</span>=<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>recent<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>&gt;
    &lt;<span class="pl-ent">li</span>&gt;%title%&lt;/<span class="pl-ent">li</span>&gt;
  &lt;/<span class="pl-ent">output</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span class="pl-ent">ul</span>&gt;</pre>
<p>
I’d completely forgotten about this, and in scanning through the PHP it
looked like it had extra features that I hadn’t described in the post.
</p>
<p>
So… I fed my 22 year old <code>TemplateParser.class.php</code> file into
Claude and prompted:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>Write detailed markdown documentation for this template
language</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here’s
<a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2003/template-docs.html">the
resulting documentation</a>. It’s pretty good, but the highlight was the
<a href="https://claude.ai/share/1627f1f3-4b07-4eb3-af24-5ac2da96b712">Claude
transcript</a> which concluded:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This appears to be a custom template system from the mid-2000s era,
designed to separate presentation logic from PHP code while maintaining
database connectivity for dynamic content generation.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Mid-2000s era indeed!

Postgres</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-01, updated: 2025-07-01, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://planetscale.com/blog/planetscale-for-postgres#vitess-for-postgres">Announcing
PlanetScale for Postgres</a></strong>
</p>
PlanetScale formed in 2018 to build a commercial offering on top of the
Vitess MySQL sharding open source project, which was originally released
by YouTube in 2012. The PlanetScale founders were the co-creators and
maintainers of Vitess.
</p>
<p>
Today PlanetScale are announcing a private preview of their new
horizontally sharded PostgreSQL solution, due to “overwhelming” demand.
</p>
<p>
Notably, it doesn’t use Vitess under the hood:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Vitess is one of PlanetScale’s greatest strengths […] We have made
explicit sharding accessible to hundreds of thousands of users and it is
time to bring this power to Postgres. We will not however be using
Vitess to do this.
</p>
<p>
Vitess’ achievements are enabled by leveraging MySQL’s strengths and
engineering around its weaknesses. To achieve Vitess’ power for Postgres
we are architecting from first principles.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Meanwhile, on June 10th Supabase announced that they had
<a href="https://supabase.com/blog/multigres-vitess-for-postgres">hired
Vitess co-creator Sugu Sougoumarane</a> to help them build “Multigres:
Vitess for Postgres”. Sugu said:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
For some time, I’ve been considering a Vitess adaptation for Postgres,
and this feeling had been gradually intensifying. The recent explosion
in the popularity of Postgres has fueled this into a full-blown
obsession. […]
</p>
<p>
The project to address this problem must begin now, and I’m convinced
that Vitess provides the most promising foundation.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>I remember when MySQL was an order of magnitude more popular than
PostgreSQL, and Heroku’s decision to only offer PostgreSQL back in 2007
was a surprising move. The vibes have certainly shifted.</p>

You still need someone who understands the basics to get the good

Raspberry Pi’s RP2350 microcontroller debuted last year as a tiny,
low-power chip for inexpensive devices. Compared with the previous-gen
RP2040 microcontroller, the RP2350 brings faster MCU cores, twice as
much memory, support for more I/O and two RISC-V CPU cores – it’s even
possible to run a minimal Linux distro on hardware featuring the RP2350

<p>date: 2025-06-30, updated: 2025-06-30, from: Simon Willison’s

<strong><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-chat">microsoft/vscode-copilot-chat</a></strong>
</p>
As
<a href="https://github.com/newsroom/press-releases/coding-agent-for-github-copilot">promised</a>
at Build 2025 in May, Microsoft have released the GitHub Copilot Chat
client for VS Code under an open source (MIT) license.
</p>
<p>
So far this is just the extension that provides the chat component of
Copilot, but
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2025/06/30/openSourceAIEditorFirstMilestone">the
launch announcement</a> promises that Copilot autocomplete will be
coming in the near future:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Next, we will carefully refactor the relevant components of the
extension into VS Code core. The
<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot">original
GitHub Copilot extension</a> that provides inline completions remains
closed source – but in the following months we plan to have that
functionality be provided by the open sourced
<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat">GitHub
Copilot Chat extension</a>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’ve started spelunking around looking for the all-important prompts. So
far the most interesting I’ve found are in
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-chat/blob/v0.29.2025063001/src/extension/prompts/node/agent/agentInstructions.tsx">prompts/node/agent/agentInstructions.tsx</a>,
with a <code>&lt;Tag name=‘instructions’&gt;</code> block that
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-chat/blob/v0.29.2025063001/src/extension/prompts/node/agent/agentInstructions.tsx#L39">starts
like this</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>You are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with
expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and
frameworks. The user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task,
and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a
selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful
context to answer the user’s question.</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There are
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-chat/blob/v0.29.2025063001/src/extension/prompts/node/agent/agentInstructions.tsx#L54">tool
use instructions</a> - some edited highlights from those:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<code>When using the ReadFile tool, prefer reading a large section over
calling the ReadFile tool many times in sequence. You can also think of
all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read
large enough context to ensure you get what you need.</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>You can use the FindTextInFiles to get an overview of a file by
searching for a string within that one file, instead of using ReadFile
many times.</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>Don’t call the RunInTerminal tool multiple times in parallel.
Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next
command.</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>After you have performed the user’s task, if the user corrected
something you did, expressed a coding preference, or communicated a fact
that you need to remember, use the UpdateUserPreferences tool to save
their preferences.</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>NEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the
user specifically asks for it.</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>Use the ReplaceString tool to replace a string in a file, but only
if you are sure that the string is unique enough to not cause any
issues. You can use this tool multiple times per file.</code>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
That file also has separate
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-chat/blob/v0.29.2025063001/src/extension/prompts/node/agent/agentInstructions.tsx#L127">CodesearchModeInstructions</a>,
as well as a
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-chat/blob/v0.29.2025063001/src/extension/prompts/node/agent/agentInstructions.tsx#L160">SweBenchAgentPrompt</a>
class with a comment saying that it is “used for some evals with
swebench”.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere in the code,
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-chat/blob/v0.29.2025063001/src/extension/prompt/node/summarizer.ts">prompt/node/summarizer.ts</a>
illustrates one of their approaches to
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/29/how-to-fix-your-context/">Context
Summarization</a>, with a prompt that looks like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>You are an expert at summarizing chat conversations.</code><br>
</p>
<p>
<code>You will be provided:</code><br>
</p>
<p>
<code>- A series of user/assistant message pairs in chronological
order</code><br> <code>- A final user message indicating the user’s
intent.</code><br>
</p>
<p>
<code>[…]</code><br>
</p>
<p>
<code>Structure your summary using the following format:</code><br>
</p>
<p>
<code>TITLE: A brief title for the summary</code><br> <code>USER INTENT:
The user’s goal or intent for the conversation</code><br> <code>TASK
DESCRIPTION: Main technical goals and user requirements</code><br>
<code>EXISTING: What has already been accomplished. Include file paths
and other direct references.</code><br> <code>PENDING: What still needs
to be done. Include file paths and other direct references.</code><br>
<code>CODE STATE: A list of all files discussed or modified. Provide
code snippets or diffs that illustrate important context.</code><br>
<code>RELEVANT CODE/DOCUMENTATION SNIPPETS: Key code or documentation
snippets from referenced files or discussions.</code><br> <code>OTHER
NOTES: Any additional context or information that may be
relevant.</code><br>
</p>
</blockquote>

looks interesting too, with prompts to help users fix problems they are
having in the terminal:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>You are a programmer who specializes in using the command line.
Your task is to help the user fix a command that was run in the terminal
by providing a list of fixed command suggestions. Carefully consider the
command line, output and current working directory in your response.
[…]</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That file also has
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-chat/blob/v0.29.2025063001/src/extension/prompts/node/panel/terminalQuickFix.tsx#L201">a
PythonModuleError prompt</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>Follow these guidelines for python:</code><br> <code>- NEVER
recommend using “pip install” directly, always recommend “python -m pip
install”</code><br> <code>- The following are pypi modules: ruff,
pylint, black, autopep8, etc</code><br> <code>- If the error is module
not found, recommend installing the module using “python -m pip install”
command.</code><br> <code>- If activate is not available create an
environment using “python -m venv .venv”.</code><br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There’s so much more to explore in here.
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-chat/blob/v0.29.2025063001/src/extension/xtab/common/promptCrafting.ts#L34">xtab/common/promptCrafting.ts</a>
looks like it may be part of the code that’s intended to replace Copilot
autocomplete, for example.
</p>
<p>
The way it handles evals is really interesting too. The code for that
lives
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-chat/tree/v0.29.2025063001/test">in
the test/</a> directory. There’s a <em>lot</em> of it, so I engaged
Gemini 2.5 Pro to help figure out how it worked:
</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-chat
cd vscode-copilot-chat/chat
files-to-prompt -e ts -c . | llm -m gemini-2.5-pro -s \
  'Output detailed markdown architectural documentation explaining how this test suite works, with a focus on how it tests LLM prompts'
</code></pre>
<p>
Here’s
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/public-notes/blob/main/vs-code-copilot-evals.md">the
resulting generated documentation</a>, which even includes a Mermaid
chart (I had to save the Markdown in a regular GitHub repository to get
that to render - Gists still don’t handle Mermaid.)
</p>
<p>
<p>The neatest trick is the way it uses
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/public-notes/blob/main/vs-code-copilot-evals.md#the-golden-standard-cached-responses">a
SQLite-based caching mechanism</a> to cache the results of prompts from
the LLM, which allows the test suite to be run deterministically even

InstCombine: improve optimizations for ceiling division with no overflow
- a PR by Alex Gaynor and Claude Code</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-30, updated: 2025-06-30, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/142869">llvm:
InstCombine: improve optimizations for ceiling division with no overflow
- a PR by Alex Gaynor and Claude Code</a></strong>
</p>
Alex Gaynor maintains
<a href="https://github.com/alex/rust-asn1">rust-asn1</a>, and recently
spotted a missing LLVM compiler optimization while hacking on it, with
<a href="https://claude.ai/share/d998511d-45ee-4132-bee4-fe7f70350a67">the
assistance of Claude</a> (Alex works for Anthropic).
</p>
<p>
He describes how he confirmed that optimization in
<a href="https://alexgaynor.net/2025/jun/20/serialize-some-der/">So you
want to serialize some DER?</a>, taking advantage of a tool called
<a href="https://github.com/AliveToolkit/alive2">Alive2</a> to
automatically verify that the potential optimization resulted in the
same behavior.
</p>
<p>
Alex <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/142497">filed
a bug</a>, and then…
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Obviously the next move is to see if I can send a PR to LLVM, but it’s
been years since I was doing compiler development or was familiar with
the LLVM internals and I wasn’t really prepared to invest the time and
energy necessary to get back up to speed. But as a friend pointed out…
what about Claude?
</p>
<p>
At this point my instinct was, “Claude is great, but I’m not sure if
I’ll be able to effectively code review any changes it proposes, and I’m
<em>not</em> going to be the asshole who submits an untested and
unreviewed PR that wastes a bunch of maintainer time”. But excitement
got the better of me, and I asked <code>claude-code</code> to see if it
could implement the necessary optimization, based on nothing more than
the test cases.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Alex reviewed the resulting code <em>very</em> carefully to ensure he
wasn’t wasting anyone’s time, then submitted
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/142869">the PR</a>
and had Claude Code help implement the various changes requested by the
reviewers. The optimization
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/632151fbeea972f4aa3c14921eca1e45c07646f3">landed</a>
two weeks ago.
</p>
<p>
Alex’s conclusion (emphasis mine):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I am incredibly leery about
<a href="https://alexgaynor.net/2025/mar/05/generality/">over-generalizing</a>
how to understand the capacity of the models, but at a minimum it seems
safe to conclude that <strong>sometimes you should just let the model
have a shot at a problem and you may be surprised – particularly when
the problem has very clear success criteria</strong>. This only works if
you have the capacity to review what it produces, of course. […]
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This echoes Ethan Mollick’s advice to “always invite AI to the table”.
For programming tasks the “very clear success criteria” is extremely
important, as it helps fit the tools-in-a-loop pattern implemented by
coding agents such as Claude Code.
</p>
<p>
LLVM have
<a href="https://llvm.org/docs/DeveloperPolicy.html#ai-generated-contributions">a
policy</a> on AI-assisted contributions which is compatible with Alex’s
work here:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
[…] the LLVM policy is that contributors are permitted to use artificial
intelligence tools to produce contributions, provided that they have the
right to license that code under the project license. Contributions
found to violate this policy will be removed just like any other
offending contribution.
</p>
<p>
While the LLVM project has a liberal policy on AI tool use, contributors
are considered responsible for their contributions. We encourage
contributors to review all generated code before sending it for review
to verify its correctness and to understand it so that they can answer
questions during code review.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Back in April Ben Evans
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@kittylyst/114397697851381604">put out
a call</a> for concrete evidence that LLM tools were being used to solve
non-trivial problems in mature open source projects:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I keep hearing #AI boosters / talking heads claiming that #LLMs have
transformed software development […] Share some AI-derived pull requests
that deal with non-obvious corner cases or non-trivial bugs from mature
#opensource projects.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think this LLVM optimization definitely counts!
</p>
<p>
<p>(I also like how this story supports the idea that AI tools amplify
existing human expertise rather than replacing it. Alex had previous
experience with LLVM, albeit rusty, and could lean on that knowledge to
help direct and evaluate Claude’s work.)</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-30, from: Authors Union blogs</p>
<p>In May 2025, Connecticut’s legislature passed landmark legislation to
address restrictive ebook licensing practices that limit libraries’
ability to serve the public. It aims to ensure ebook licenses align more
closely with  libraries’ core public interest mission of lending,
access, and preservation. This represents a pivotal step toward
safeguarding the role of libraries in the digital age. As more states
consider similar measures, a key question arises: Should authors support
these efforts? The answer is unequivocally yes— and here’s why.</p>

Coding: The Future of Software Development with Agents</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-29, updated: 2025-06-29, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfOVgz_omlU">Agentic
Coding: The Future of Software Development with Agents</a></strong>
</p>
Armin Ronacher delivers a 37 minute YouTube talk describing his
adventures so far with Claude Code and agentic coding methods.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A friend called Claude Code catnip for programmers and it really feels
like this. I haven’t felt so energized and confused and just so willing
to try so many new things… it is really incredibly addicting.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I picked up a bunch of useful tips from this video:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Armin runs Claude Code with the
<code>–dangerously-skip-permissions</code> option, and says this unlocks
a huge amount of productivity. I haven’t been brave enough to do this
yet but I’m going to start using that option while running in a Docker
container to ensure nothing too bad can happen.
</li>
<li>
When your agentic coding tool can run commands in a terminal you can
mostly avoid MCP - instead of adding a new MCP tool, write a script or
add a Makefile command and tell the agent to use that instead. The only
MCP Armin uses is
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp">the Playwright
one</a>.
</li>
<li>
Combined logs are a really good idea: have everything log to the same
place and give the agent an easy tool to read the most recent N log
lines.
</li>
<li>
While running Claude Code, use Gemini CLI to run sub-agents, to perform
additional tasks without using up Claude Code’s own context
</li>
<li>
Designing additional tools that provide very clear errors, so the agents
can recover when something goes wrong.
</li>
<li>
Thanks to Playwright, Armin has Claude Code perform all sorts of
automated operations via a signed in browser instance as well. “Claude
can debug your CI… it can sign into a browser, click around, debug…” -
he also has it use the <code>gh</code> GitHub CLI tool to interact with
things like <a href="https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_workflow">GitHub
Actions workflows</a>.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="episode-160---what-can-lunar-lander-tell-us-about-focal">Episode
160 - What can Lunar Lander tell us about FOCAL?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-29, from: Advent of Computing</p>
<p>
Lunar Lander is one of the best loves video games of all time. The game
was created in 1969 as an homage to the recent Apollo 11. From there it
would only spread. Just about anything that can print text has it’s own
version of Lunar Lander.
</p>
<p>
The early history of this game is mixed up with something weird: two
nearly identical programming languages. Today we will be using the
history of Lunar Lander as a good excuse to look at an obscure tongue
called FOCAL. This language is so close to BASIC that direct
line-by-line translation is possible. But are the two connected?

Use keyword-only arguments in Python dataclasses</a></strong>
</p>
<p>Useful tip from Christian Hammond: if you create a Python dataclass
using <code><span class="citation"
data-cites="dataclass">@dataclass</span>(kw_only=True)</code> its
constructor will require keyword arguments, making it easier to add
additional properties in the future, including in subclasses, without
risking breaking existing code.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-fix-your-context">How to Fix Your Context</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-29, updated: 2025-06-29, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/26/how-to-fix-your-context.html">How
to Fix Your Context</a></strong>
</p>
Drew Breunig has been publishing some very detailed notes on
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/27/context-engineering/">context
engineering</a> recently. In
<a href="https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/22/how-contexts-fail-and-how-to-fix-them.html">How
Long Contexts Fail</a> he described four common patterns for
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/18/context-rot/">context
rot</a>, which he summarizes like so:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Context Poisoning</strong>: When a hallucination or other error
makes it into the context, where it is repeatedly referenced.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Context Distraction</strong>: When a context grows so long that
the model over-focuses on the context, neglecting what it learned during
training.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Context Confusion</strong>: When superfluous information in the
context is used by the model to generate a low-quality response.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Context Clash</strong>: When you accrue new information and
tools in your context that conflicts with other information in the
prompt.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
In
<a href="https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/26/how-to-fix-your-context.html">this
follow-up</a> he introduces neat ideas (and more new terminology) for
addressing those problems.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Tool Loadout</strong> describes selecting a subset of tools to
enable for a prompt, based on research that shows anything beyond 20 can
confuse some models.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Context Quarantine</strong> is “the act of isolating contexts in
their own dedicated threads” - I’ve called rhis sub-agents in the past,
it’s the pattern
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/2/claude-trace/">used by
Claude Code</a> and explored in depth in
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/14/multi-agent-research-system/">Anthropic’s
multi-agent research paper</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Context Pruning</strong> is “removing irrelevant or otherwise
unneeded information from the context”, and <strong>Context
Summarization</strong> is the act of boiling down an accrued context
into a condensed summary. These techniques become particularly important
as conversations get longer and run closer to the model’s token limits.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Context Offloading</strong> is “the act of storing information
outside the LLM’s context”. I’ve seen several systems implement their
own “memory” tool for saving and then revisiting notes as they work, but
an even more interesting example recently is how various coding agents
create and update <code>plan.md</code> files as they work through larger
problems.
</p>
<p>
Drew’s conclusion:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The key insight across all the above tactics is that <em>context is not
free</em>. Every token in the context influences the model’s behavior,
for better or worse. The massive context windows of modern LLMs are a
powerful capability, but they’re not an excuse to be sloppy with
information management.
</p>
