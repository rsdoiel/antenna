is using stealth, undeclared crawlers to evade website no-crawl
directives</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>We are observing stealth crawling behavior from Perplexity, an
AI-powered answer engine. Although Perplexity initially crawls from
their declared user agent, when they are presented with a network block,
they appear to obscure their crawling identity in an attempt to
circumvent the website’s preferences. We see continued evidence that
Perplexity is repeatedly modifying their user agent and changing their
source ASNs to hide their crawling activity, as well as ignoring — or
sometimes failing to even fetch — robots.txt files. The Internet as we
have known it for the past three decades is rapidly changing, but one
thing remains constant: it is built on trust. There are clear
preferences that crawlers should be transparent, serve a clear purpose,
perform a specific activity, and, most importantly, follow website
directives and preferences. Based on Perplexity’s observed behavior,
which is incompatible with those preferences, we have de-listed them as
a verified bot and added heuristics to our managed rules that block this
stealth crawling. ↫ The CloudFlare Blog Never forget they destroyed
Aaron Swartz’s life – literally – for downloading a few JSTOR
articles.</p>

<h2 id="orbitiny-desktop-1.0-pilot-4-released">Orbitiny Desktop 1.0
Pilot 4 released</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s not every day you stumble upon an X11 desktop environment you’ve
never hard of, but today’s one of those days. The Orbitiny Desktop
Environment is a one-person project, consisting of an entirely custom
desktop environment written in Qt. Version 1.0 Pilot 4 was just
released. Built from the ground up using Qt and coded in C++, Orbitiny
Desktop is a new, 100% portable, innovative and traditional but modern
looking desktop environment for Linux. Innovative because it has
features not seen in any other desktop environment before while keeping
traditional aspects of computing alive (desktop icons, menus etc).
Portable because you can run it on any distro and on any live CD and
that’s because everything gets saved inside the directory that gets
created when the archive is extracted (this can be changed so that the
settings go to $HOME/.config/orbitiny). ↫ Orbitiny Desktop Environment
Gitea page It’s got all the usual amenities like a desktop, panels, and
so on, and a custom file manager. It’s also replete with a ton of small
features that you don’t see very often, like full mouse gesture support
on the desktop and a device manager that can enable/disable devices
without blacklisting kernel modules. When you cut or copy a file, its
icon will get a little emblem to indicate it’s on the clipboard, you can
append and prepend files using simple drag-and-drop operations, you can
set individual desktop directories for each virtual desktop, and much
more. Now, it’s technically not a full desktop environment, because it
doesn’t have things like a session manager, power manager, various
hardware configuration panels, and so on, but it can be run on top of
existing desktop environments. While it has basic Wayland support, not
all components work there, so X11 is the main focus for now. Considering
it’s a one-person project, you can’t expect a bug or issue-free
experience, but that doesn’t mean it’s any less damn impressive. I
honestly feel like there’s something valuable and interesting here, and
I’d love for more people to get involved to see where this can go.
There’s clearly a ton of love and dedication here, and the various
unique features clearly set it apart from everything else. If you have
the skills, consider helping out.</p>

to Qubes OS when you do not know what it is</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>Solène Rapenne, who writes a lot about and contributes to operating
systems like OpenBSD and Qubes OS, has published a primer about what,
exactly, Qubes OS is. I like to call Qubes OS a meta operating system,
because it is not a Linux / BSD / Windows based OS: its core is Xen
(some kind of virtualization enabled kernel). Not only it’s Xen based,
but by design it is meant to run virtual machines, hence the name “meta
operating system” which is an OS meant to run many OSes make sense to
me. ↫ Solène Rapenne Rapenne explains the various ways in which isolated
virtual machines are used in Qubes OS, and it’s easy to see just how
secure Qubes OS’ way of doing things is. At the same time, it seems
quite cumbersome to me as a regular user, and I don’t think I’m up for
dealing with all of that. If you do security research, handle private or
classified data, are a whistleblower or an investigative journalist,
thoug, Qubes seems like a natural choice. Interesting to note is that
Rapenne used to use OpenBSD for her security work, but moved to Qubes OS
because its virtual machine infrastructure is far more robust, and
hardware support is better, as well.</p>

id="a-real-powerbook-the-macintosh-application-environment-on-a-pa-risc-laptop">A
real PowerBook: the Macintosh Application Environment on a PA-RISC
laptop</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>In October 1997 you could have bought a PowerBook 3400c running up to
a 240MHz PowerPC 603e for $6500 , which was briefly billed as the
world’s fastest laptop, or you could have bought this monster new to the
market, the RDI PrecisionBook running up to a 160MHz (later 180MHz)
PA-7300LC starting at $12,000 . Both provided onboard Ethernet, SCSI and
CardBus PCMCIA slots. On the other hand, while the 3400c had an internal
media bay for either a floppy or CD-ROM, both external options on the
PrecisionBook, the PrecisionBook gave you a 1024×768 LCD (versus 800×600
on the 3400c), a bigger keyboard, at least two 2.5″ hard disk bays and
up to 512MB of RAM (versus 144MB) — and HP-UX. And, through the magic of
Apple’s official Macintosh Application Environment, you could do
anything on it an HP PA-RISC workstation could do and run 68K Mac
software on it at the same time. Look at the photograph and see: on our
160MHz unit we’ve got HP-UX 11.00 CDE running simultaneously with a full
Macintosh System 7.5.3 desktop. Yes, only a real Power Mac could run
PowerPC software back then, but 68K software was still plentiful and
functional. Might this have been a viable option to have your expensive
cake and eat it too? We’ll find out and run some real apps on it
(including that game we must all try running), analyze its performance
and technical underpinnings, and uncover an unusual artifact of its
history hidden in the executable. ↫ Cameron Kaiser at Old Vintage
Computing Research I actually have Apple’s Macintosh Application
Environment installed and running on my PA-RISC machines, and it’s
incredible just how well-made and complete it really is. You get a full
Mac desktop and its applications, excellent integration with the host,
file sharing between host and client, and so much more. Running it on
newer versions of HP-UX than it was originally intended for does lead to
the odd issue here and there, but due to HP-UX’ excellent backwards
compatibility, it all just works. It has created this odd situation that
my 2004 HP c8000 machine, with two of the fastest dual-core PA-RISC
processors ever made, will most likely be the fastest machine I’ll ever
officially run classic Mac OS on. Sure, you can use other emulators not
created and blessed by Apple and run classic Mac OS on much faster
hardware, but if you want to stick to official, supported methods of
running the classic Mac OS, it doesn’t get much faster than this.</p>

data I had stored with them. No warning. No grace period. No recovery
options. Just complete digital annihilation. This is the story of a
catastrophic internal mistake at AWS MENA, a 20-day support nightmare
