id="the-programs-approach-our-experiences-during-the-first-quarter-of-2025">The
programs approach: our experiences during the first quarter of 2025</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-08, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
At the end of last year, we were excited to announce
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/a-progress-update-and-a-renewed-commitment-to-community/">our
renewed commitment to community </a>and the launch of three
cross-functional programs to guide and accelerate our work. We
introduced this new approach to work towards better cross-team
alignment, shared responsibility, improved communication and learning,
and make more progress on the things members need.
</p>
<p>
In line with the Crossref strategic agenda, the three programs focus on:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Co-creation and Community Trends (CCT)</strong>: This program is
responsible for interfaces such as reports/dashboards, record
registration interfaces, connections and collaborations such as
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/">Open Funder
Registry</a>, <a href="https://ror.org/" target="_blank">ROR</a>,
<a href="https://orcid.org/" target="_blank">ORCID</a> auto-update, as
well as <a href="https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/" target="_blank">OJS</a> and
other partner integrations. This program also includes the Crossref
website and any front-end interfaces to support other programs. It
includes initiatives aimed at upholding the integrity of the scholarly
record and our tools in this area, such as
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/crossmark/">Crossmark</a> and
retraction/correction tooling, and
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/similarity-check/">Similarity
Check</a> for text comparisons.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Contributing to the Research Nexus (CRN)</strong>: This program
manages and oversees all activities relating to contributing to the
Research Nexus. A lot of the work in this program revolves around our
REST API, but also includes our other APIs, incorporating external data
sources like
<a href="https://retractionwatch.com/" target="_blank">Retraction
Watch</a> and Event Data, building out metadata matching services with
the new data science team, supporting the community of metadata users
with API sprints and more modern options for retrieving metadata based
on usage and need.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Open and Sustainable Operations (OSO):</strong> This program
manages and oversees all activities related to making our operations
more open, transparent, and sustainable. This program focuses on
supporting and strengthening the core functions our members rely on and
enabling future growth. It includes metadata deposit and processing,
most apps for e.g. managing titles, authentication, and architectural
and infrastructural projects like moving from the data centre to the AWS
cloud service. This program also includes modernising our operations in
general, which is not just technology but also finance and human
resources, so projects like membership process automation, financial
analyses, and business system integrations.
</li>
</ul>

<img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2024/strategic-themes-programs-landscape-slide.png"
alt="screenshot from Strategy page showing Crossref strategic themes." width="75%">
</figure>
</div>
<p>
The approach we are taking is to support the work within the programs
through (internal) cross-functional steering groups. Led by three
program leads (who share updates on their programs below), three program
steering groups meet regularly to discuss the topics and work that fall
within the scope of each program. The steering groups consist of
representatives from all teams within Crossref, which means every
steering group has people from the community team, membership team,
technical team, data science team, and operations and finance team,
bringing all the perspectives and expertise needed to prioritise the
next steps for Crossref and fostering broad knowledge sharing and shared
responsibility.
</p>
<p>
Although the whole organisation contributes to these programs, they are
coordinated by the Programs and Services team. The team was formed
towards the end of 2024, and on the 1st of February,
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/people/helena-cousijn">Helena
Cousijn</a> joined Crossref in the new role of Director of Programs and
Services. Helena has a background in both product management and
community engagement and is very excited to help Crossref shape the
programs approach and work with all teams across the organisation to
drive the strategic agenda forward!
</p>
<p>
If you’d like to keep an eye on the work that is happening within each
program, you can find more information on the

</p>
<h2 id="co-creation-and-community-trends-cct">
Co-creation and Community Trends (CCT)
</h2>
<p>
The mission of the CCT program is to build and foster relationships with
our community and other services and organisations within it, so that
Crossref can meet and anticipate community needs. Curiosity and
listening are at the core of how we co-create to tackle emerging
challenges, develop best practices, and explore new ideas for building
the Research Nexus. We want our work to benefit all of Crossref’s
diverse stakeholders - from our own colleagues and members to
underrepresented communities in the wider scholarly ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
In the first quarter of 2025, our focus areas have been:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Improvements to our
<a href="https://manage.crossref.org/records" target="_blank">new record
registration form for journal articles</a>, which already supports
grants, and was launched in beta for articles in 2024. For example, the
form now has a built-in reference deposit feature. Join the conversation
on the
<a href="https://community.crossref.org/t/feedback-on-new-helper-tool/1721" target="_blank">community
forum</a> for updates and feedback on this new helper tool.
</li>
<li>
Running a series of multilingual
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/events/metadata-health-check-webinars/">metadata
health check webinars</a>. There are more of these coming up throughout
Q2, so it’s not too late to sign up for one if you are interested.
</li>
<li>
Integrating with
<a href="https://rogue-scholar.org/" target="_blank">Rogue Scholar</a>
to automate the assignment of DOIs to, and the archiving of, posts on
this very blog.
</li>
<li>
Planning for the inaugural Crossref Metadata Awards - join our upcoming
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/events/crossref-community-call-2025/" target="_blank">community
call</a> on 7 May to find out what this is all about.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In the coming months, we are hoping to tackle the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Kick off a project to review the information architecture of this
website and look into how we can make our documentation and related
information more helpful and easier to navigate.
</li>
<li>
Expand the record registration form for journal articles to allow easy
editing of previously submitted records. This will allow us to sunset
the long-deprecated Metadata Manager tool, as was first
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/next-steps-for-content-registration/">announced</a>
in 2021.
</li>
<li>
Begin building new record registration forms for more work types. Watch
this space.
</li>
<li>
Explore options for supporting the integration of additional software
systems with Crossref, building on our existing approach with OJS
plugins, with a focus on open-source tools relied upon by our members
for registering metadata.
</li>
<li>
Restore faceted search on
<a href="https://search.crossref.org/" target="_blank">Crossref Metadata
Search</a>. This feature
<a href="https://community.crossref.org/t/some-changes-to-crossref-metadata-search-search-crossref-org/2529" target="_blank">was
disabled in 2022</a> following intermittent performance issues. We
believe recent improvements to Metadata Search will allow us to bring
some filters back, although we will need to start small so as not to
overload our systems with these more complex queries.
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="contributing-to-the-research-nexus-crn">
Contributing to the Research Nexus (CRN)
</h2>
<p>
The research nexus is a rich and reusable open network that represents
scholarly activity. It consists of connections between research
organisations, people, things, and actions; it’s an evolving model of
the scholarly record that the global community can build on forever for
the benefit of society.
</p>
<p>
Our metadata is already a contribution to the research nexus, however,
there is much more we would like to do. Our next steps will be to
consolidate our existing data and services, and build the technical
capacity, partnerships, and knowledge to enhance our contribution with
new relationships. Some parts of our data storage and workflows don’t
yet have the flexibility to fully capture all types of research objects
and how they are connected.
</p>
<p>
To support this process, the main priorities in the program are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Collaborate with our community. We want to get to know users of our
metadata better and work more collaboratively alongside them. Also, we
seek partners to contribute new data sources that will enhance our
metadata with additional relationships.
</li>
<li>
Share the research nexus vision. We know that we aren’t alone in
developing the research nexus, so we will reach out to others with a
similar vision and identify where we have common goals.
</li>
<li>
Maintain our technology. We have already identified technical
improvements we can make to our REST API, and we need to keep on top of
monitoring and fixing bugs. We also need to build capacity for new types
of data and relationships. Our other endpoints, such as the XML API and
forwardlinks (for citations), need maintenance and are likely to be
affected by a planned redesign of our core architecture.
</li>
<li>
Building a new matching service. Identifying relationships between
metadata records is a key part of the research nexus. We have already
improved reference matching over the years, and we’re looking to
implement funding, affiliations, and version matching next. We’ve
carried out
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/categories/metadata-matching/" target="_blank">research</a>
on several types of matching and are looking at building a new service
to handle it in production.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
In the first quarter of 2025, we’ve been working on:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Schema changes, making the first significant updates to our schema for
several years, including adding the capacity for depositing ROR IDs for
funding organisations in funding metadata.
</li>
<li>
Delivering Retraction Watch retractions via the REST API, integrated
with member-supplied retraction/correction data.
</li>
<li>
Getting the community involved and understanding needs, planning a
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/events/metadata-sprint/" target="_blank">sprint</a>
and various workshops.
</li>
<li>
Plenty of under-the-hood updates to the REST API, and more significant
upgrades to come later this year.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Next up, we will:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Plan and build out the new matching service.
</li>
<li>
Improve representation of some metadata in the REST API, including
Crossref members, journals, and typed citations such as data citations.
</li>
<li>
Update the grants schema to extend the award types and respond to new
funder member requests
</li>
<li>
Add contributor roles to the schema, including CRediT.
</li>
<li>
Ask our community about metadata retrieval, including the various APIs
and the Metadata Plus subscription service.
</li>
<li>
Upgrade elements of the REST API and optimise the underlying technical
infrastructure.
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="open-and-sustainable-operations-oso">
Open and Sustainable Operations (OSO)
</h2>
<p>
The OSO program is centered on transparency and sustainability of our
technical systems and our business and people operations. We focus on
maintaining critical systems and operations and ensuring their security,
addressing technical and operational debt, and controlling or reducing
costs - to Crossref, our community, or the environment. We’re always
keen to tackle projects to automate repetitive and manual tasks – of
which we have many – and pay down technical debt, being as open and
transparent as possible along the way.
</p>
<p>
Our most recently completed work includes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Moving from Oracle to an open-source database, PostgreSQL. This work
aligns with the POSI principles and sets us up for a more robust,
reliable, and modern infrastructure.
</li>
<li>
Implementing metadata schema changes for deposit submission and
processing, so we can now accept
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/come-ror-with-us-using-ror-ids-in-place-of-funder-ids/" target="_blank">ROR
IDs in funding metadata</a>, as well as the changes in
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/version-5.4.0-metadata-schema-update-now-available/" target="_blank">latest
schema version</a> (5.4.0) which includes the new ability to label
references with a type (such as dataset, software, blog post, article,
etc.).
</li>
<li>
Automating parts of the process to keep
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/sponsors/" target="_blank">Sponsor
information</a> on our website up to date and make it easier to search,
so our community can find relevant and accurate information about our
Sponsors and how to work with them, and our membership team spends less
time keeping the website current.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Ongoing work in our program includes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Moving from a physical data center into the cloud (AWS). The PostgreSQL
migration was the first step needed to enable our move to the cloud,
which will allow us to operate more sustainably and efficiently.
</li>
<li>
Automating new member setup in our systems, which is largely a manual
process now.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
And coming up are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Making changes in our core system to accept the upcoming 5.5 metadata
schema version.
</li>
<li>
Extracting billing code from our main codebase, to set up as its own
service. This will allow us to simplify our code and make it easier to
maintain. We’ll also be implementing the changes to billing enacted as
part of the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/community/special-programs/resourcing-crossref/" target="_blank">Resourcing
Crossref for Future Sustainability</a> program (TBD!).
</li>
<li>
Holding a “systems workshop” in April, to understand how our current
system(s) are and aren’t meeting staff, member, and community needs, and
how we might go about building the open, sustainable Crossref system of
the future.
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-have-we-learned-so-far">
What have we learned so far?

<h3 id="internal-communication">
Internal communication
</h3>
<p>
One of the reasons to implement a programs approach was to improve
internal communication across the organisation. With all teams being
represented on all steering groups, everyone is in the loop when
decisions are taken. We see that this way, people feel more connected to
the strategic agenda and, importantly, the ‘why’ is clearer to people.
It is easier to get perspectives from across the organisation because
contributing to these conversations is now part of people’s day jobs and
so it’s easier to ask for their time. We are still looking to improve
how we facilitate group discussions and decision-making to ensure we
make the most of the program steering groups.

Planning and delivery
</h3>
<p>
Working closely with people from across the organisation has helped with
more effective planning. A closer collaboration between program leads
and developers makes the delivery of new features and functionality more
accurate and predictable. With the community and support teams also
being part of the conversation, they can plan related comms and
support/documentation efforts in a timely manner. So far, it has also
been easier to get more things delivered. We have some big projects
coming up this year that will be a good test for the programs approach!

<h3 id="cross-cutting-topics">
Cross-cutting topics
</h3>
<p>
The implementation of a cross-functional approach facilitates
discussions around cross-cutting topics, but also leads to the question
of how cross-cutting topics fit within a specific program! Maybe you
already noticed that work on metadata schema 5.4 and the planned work on
5.5 is included under both Contributing to the Research Nexus and Open
and Sustainable Operations in the update above. Because metadata
development impacts many of our systems, work was needed within all
programs to enable these changes - the input, the output and the
interfaces. Later this year, we’re planning to share some visuals that
better explain which projects sit with which program and how we deal
with cross-cutting topics.

<h3 id="alignment">
Alignment
</h3>
<p>
One of the most important things for the approach to be successful is
that people are bought in and willing to participate and communicate.
For cross-organisational alignment, a culture needs to be in place (or
developed) where people are willing to collaborate and be open and
transparent about their work. In a practical sense, we are still looking
at how we can better align our code bases with the current programs so
that it is easier to develop the relevant expertise within the programs.
