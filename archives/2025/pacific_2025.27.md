## US agriculture agency to end consideration of race, sex in many farm programs

date: 2025-07-11, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>WASHINGTON &#8212; The U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Thursday it would no longer consider a farmer&#8217;s race or sex in many of its farm loan, commodity and conservation programs, ending a longstanding effort by the agency to address its history of discrimination. The move was made to align with the Trump administration&#8217;s directives to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion policies across the federal government and because the USDA has adequately addressed past bias, the agency said in a final rule. &#8220;Moving forward, USDA will no longer apply race- or sex-based criteria in its decision-making processes, ensuring that its programs are administered in a manner that upholds the principles of meritocracy, fairness, and equal opportunity for all participants,&#8221; said the rule, signed by acting General Counsel Ralph Linden.</p>

## Ancient proteins found in fossils up to 24 million years old

WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Scientists in recent years have made progress in finding ancient DNA in fossils, gaining insight into organisms that lived long ago. But the oldest DNA obtained so far dates back about two million years. Proteins, a cell's molecular machinery, also offer valuable information and have the virtue of surviving much longer, as new research shows.

## OpenAI to release web browser in challenge to Google Chrome

date: 2025-07-10, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>SAN FRANCISCO &#8212; OpenAI is close to releasing an AI-powered web browser that will challenge Alphabet&#8217;s market-dominating Google Chrome, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters. The browser is slated to launch in the coming weeks, three of the people said, and aims to use artificial intelligence to fundamentally change how consumers browse the web. It will give OpenAI more direct access to a cornerstone of Google&#8217;s success: user data. If adopted by the 500 million weekly active users of ChatGPT, OpenAI&#8217;s browser could put pressure on a key component of rival Google&#8217;s ad-money spigot. Chrome is an important pillar of Alphabet&#8217;s ad business, which makes up nearly three-quarters of its revenue, as Chrome provides user information to help Alphabet target ads more effectively and profitably, and also gives Google a way to route search traffic to its own engine by default.</p>
