## Pete Rose

date: 2025-05-25, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>It was so predictable. Shortly after Pete Rose died, baseball <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/article/calls-escalate-against-rob-manfred-220702792.html">rescinded his lifetime ban</a>, and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=May+13%2C+2025%2C+Manfred+instituted+a+change">now he can</a> be <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=pete+rose+hall+of+fame+induction">inducted</a> into the Hall of Fame. </p>
<p>He had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Rose#Records_and_achievements">more hits</a> than any baseball player ever. </p>
<p>A role model in so many ways, and like all heroes he had fatal flaws. You may think he set a bad example for kids, but I say the opposite. You don't give kids enough credit. What he taught was that a man with average athletic ability could will himself to achieve. </p>
<p>I grew up with a Pete Rose ethos, why shouldn't I go for it all? I feel so sad that he couldn't have gotten the acceptance he so totally deserved. How could we not forgive him? He was Charlie Hustle! <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">‚ù§Ô∏è</span></p>

## 2025-05-25 iPhone, GoPro, tears

date: 2025-05-25, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-05-25-iphone-gopro-tears">2025-05-25 iPhone, GoPro, tears</h1>

<p>I have a GoPro which I used to take a nice <a href="/wiki/2024-04-06-maledives-14.mov">6s video of a young whale</a> when we went to the <a href="2024-04-06-maledives">Maledives in 2024</a>.</p>

<p>I also took hours of not so important video. There is, of course, an iPhone app for the GoPro. It currently has 45 GB of videos on it. I can&rsquo;t access the iPhone from my wife&rsquo;s Mac without upgrading it.</p>

<p>So I use my Linux Laptop to connect to the phone. And my wife&rsquo;s Mac is mounted via wifi, and it has the external hard disk where the videos should go. Current transfer speed is 1.3 MB/sec.</p>

<p>Sometimes I do feel the bars of the golden cage. üòî</p>

<p>And there so many random errors. Or a laptop that falls asleep. Or a duplicate filename. These things always interrupt the process and wait for user input.</p>

<p>This is where the tears come in.</p>

On Thursday the Trump administration told Harvard University that because it had not handed over information on foreign students&#8217; protest activities, violent activity, and coursework, the university had &#8220;lost [the] privilege&#8221; of enrolling foreign students.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-05-25, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2021/05/30/spikeLeeKnicksFan.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">A day away from the blog. Really enjoying the NBA playoffs, even though the Knicks are still in it. Nice turnaround after the first quarter for the Minnesotas. Still hoping for a finals between them and the Knicks. It'll be interesting to see how the Knicks change their lineup. Hopefully no more isolation-ball with Brunson. It's boring and doesn't work. Melo 2.0. Might make sense if he was LeBron, but he's not and LeBron's game is boring anyway. Let's do this well, win or lose.
