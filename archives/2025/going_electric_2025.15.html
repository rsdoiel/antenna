In the past few weeks, major news outlets
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/13/business/video/byd-tesla-china-us-tariffs-marc-stewart-digvid">have
reported</a> that Chinese automotive giant BYD has overtaken Tesla as
the world’s largest seller of electric vehicles. While it may be true
that BYD has usurped Tesla to sell more electric vehicles or generate
more revenue, the idea that either is the largest EV seller in the world
completely ignores a company that sells more EVs each year than both
Tesla and BYD combined.
</p>
<p>
Those EVs just have half the wheels.
