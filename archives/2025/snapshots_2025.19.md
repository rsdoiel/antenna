## HDR in Forthcoming Halide 3

Ben Sandofsky (tweet, Hacker News): Then the algorithms combined everything into a single &#8220;photo&#8221; that matches human vision&#8230; a photo that was useless, since computer screens couldn&#8217;t display HDR. So these researchers also came up with algorithms to squeeze HDR values onto an SDR screen, which they called &#8220;Tone Mapping.&#8221;[&#8230;]HDR and Deep Fusion require that [&#8230;]

## Annotated Presentation Creator

date: 2025-05-15, updated: 2025-05-15, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/annotated-presentations">Annotated Presentation Creator</a></strong></p>
I've released a new version of my tool for creating annotated presentations. I use this to turn slides from my talks into <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/15/building-on-llms/">posts like this one</a> - here are <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/annotated-talks/">a bunch more examples</a>.</p>
<p>I wrote the first version <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Aug/6/annotated-presentations/">in August 2023</a> making extensive use of ChatGPT and GPT-4. That older version can <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/tools/annotated-presentations">still be seen here</a>.</p>
<p>This new edition is a design refresh using Claude 3.7 Sonnet (thinking). I ran this command:</p>
<pre><code>llm \
  -f https://til.simonwillison.net/tools/annotated-presentations \
  -s 'Improve this tool by making it respnonsive for mobile, improving the styling' \
  -m claude-3.7-sonnet -o thinking 1
</code></pre>
<p>That uses <code>-f</code> to fetch the original HTML (which has embedded CSS and JavaScript in a single page, convenient for working with LLMs) as a prompt fragment, then applies the system prompt instructions "Improve this tool by making it respnonsive for mobile, improving the styling" (typo included).</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/8010fca527eb588f006f70850d7c37a3">the full transcript</a> (generated using <code>llm logs -cue</code>) and <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/70e1bdbf71fd53ba89922067d3401a3b/revisions#diff-b6337e5018b8ad3d751d42ddc4bc6c1a0328190c7e7cbfeb88321142aad8f31d">a diff</a> illustrating the changes. Total cost 10.7781 cents.</p>
<p>There was one visual glitch: the slides were distorted like this:</p>
<p><img alt="The slide is distorted by being too high for its width" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/bug.jpg" /></p>
<p>I decided to try o4-mini to see if it could spot the problem (after <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/1037">fixing this LLM bug</a>):</p>
<pre><code>llm o4-mini \
  -a bug.png \
  -f https://tools.simonwillison.net/annotated-presentations \
  -s 'Suggest a minimal fix for this distorted image'
</code></pre>
<p>It suggested adding <code>align-items: flex-start;</code> to my <code>.bundle</code> class (it quoted the <code>@media (min-width: 768px)</code> bit but the solution was to add it to <code>.bundle</code> at the top level), which fixed the bug.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of an &quot;Annotated Presentation Creator&quot; web application. The interface shows: &quot;Annotated Presentation Creator&quot; header, &quot;Create beautiful annotated slides for your presentations. See How I make annotated presentations for instructions.&quot; Below is an upload area with buttons &quot;Choose Images&quot;, &quot;Load Images&quot;, &quot;Restore 64 saved items&quot;, and &quot;OCR Missing Alt Text&quot;.

## Building software on top of Large Language Models

date: 2025-05-15, updated: 2025-05-15, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p>I presented a three hour workshop at PyCon US yesterday titled <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2025/schedule/presentation/25/">Building software on top of Large Language Models</a>. The goal of the workshop was to give participants everything they needed to get started writing code that makes use of LLMs.</p>
<p>Most of the workshop was interactive: I created a detailed handout with six different exercises, then worked through them with the participants. You can  <a href="https://building-with-llms-pycon-2025.readthedocs.io/">access the handout here</a> - it should be comprehensive enough that you can follow along even without having been present in the room.</p>
<p>Here's the table of contents for the handout:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://building-with-llms-pycon-2025.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html">Setup</a> - getting LLM and related tools installed and configured for accessing the OpenAI API</li>
<li>
<a href="https://building-with-llms-pycon-2025.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prompting.html">Prompting with LLM</a> - basic prompting in the terminal, including accessing logs of past prompts and responses</li>
<li>
<a href="https://building-with-llms-pycon-2025.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prompting-python.html">Prompting from Python</a> - how to use LLM's Python API to run prompts against different models from Python code</li>
<li>
<a href="https://building-with-llms-pycon-2025.readthedocs.io/en/latest/text-to-sql.html">Building a text to SQL tool</a> - the first building exercise: prototype a text to SQL tool with the LLM command-line app, then turn that into Python code.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://building-with-llms-pycon-2025.readthedocs.io/en/latest/structured-data-extraction.html">Structured data extraction</a> - possibly the most economically valuable application of LLMs today</li>
<li>
<a href="https://building-with-llms-pycon-2025.readthedocs.io/en/latest/semantic-search-and-rag.html">Semantic search and RAG</a> - working with embeddings, building a semantic search engine</li>
<li>
<a href="https://building-with-llms-pycon-2025.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools.html">Tool usage</a> - the most important technique for building interesting applications on top of LLMs. My LLM tool <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/14/llm-adds-support-for-tools/">gained tool usage</a> in an alpha release just the night before the workshop!</li>
</ul>
<p>Some sections of the workshop involved me talking and showing slides. I've gathered those together into an <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Aug/6/annotated-presentations/">annotated presentation</a> below.</p>
<p>The workshop was not recorded, but hopefully these materials can provide a useful substitute. If you'd like me to present a private version of this workshop for your own team please <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/15/building-on-llms/#llm-tutorial-intro.032.jpeg">get in touch</a>!</p>

  <p>If you have limited attention, I think these are the three to focus on.</p>
<p>OpenAI created the space and are still innovating on a regular basis - their GPT 4.1 family is just a month old and is currently one of my favourite balances of power to cost. o4-mini is an excellent reasoning model, especially for its price.</p>
<p>Gemini started producing truly outstanding models with the 1.5 series, and 2.5 may be the best available models for a wide range of purposes.</p>
<p>Anthropic's Claude has long been one of my favourite models. I'm looking forward to their next update.</p>

  <p>There are a wide range of "open weights" (usually a more accurate term than "open source") models available, and they've been getting <em>really</em> good over the past six months.

  <p>I've heard from sources I trust that Gemini and AWS (for their Nova series, priced similar to Gemini models) are not charging less per prompt than the energy it costs to serve them.</p>
<p>This makes the prompt pricing one of the better signals we have as to the environmental impact of running those prompts.</p>
<p>I've seen <a href="https://andymasley.substack.com/p/a-cheat-sheet-for-conversations-about">estimates</a> that training costs, amortized over time, likely add 10-15% to that cost - so it's still a good hint at the overall energy usage.</p>

  <p>My recommendation is to try them out. Keep throwing things at them, including things you're sure they won't be able to handle. Their failure patterns offer useful lessons.</p>
<p>If a model can't do something it's good to tuck that away and try it again in six months - you may find that the latest generation of models can solve a new problem for you.</p>
<p>As the author of an abstraction toolkit across multiple models (<a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a>) I'm biased towards arguing it's good to be able to switch between them, but I genuinely believe it's a big advantage to be able to do so.</p>

  <p>This is also a key method for implementing <strong>semantic search</strong> - search which returns documents that are related to the user's search term even if none of the keywords were an exact match.</p>
<p>One way to do this is to embed the user's search term and find similar documents - but this doesn't always work great, since a short question might not end up in the same location as a much longer article.</p>
<p>There are neat tricks here that can help.</p>
<p>Some models allow you to embed questions and answers in different ways that cause them to end up closer to each other. <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/12/nomic-embed-text-v2/">Nomic Embed Text v2</a> is a recent example.</p>
<p>A neat trick is you can ask an LLM to entirely synthesize a potential answer to the user's question - then embed that artificial answer and find your own content that's nearby in vector space!</p>
<p>We worked through the next section of the workshop together:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://building-with-llms-pycon-2025.readthedocs.io/en/latest/semantic-search-and-rag.html">Semantic search and RAG</a></strong> - we gathered embeddings for Python PEPs and built a semantic search engine against them using LLM's command-line utilities and a Bash script.</p>
<p>I described RAG - Retrieval-Augmented Generation - the pattern where you try to find documentsv relevant to the user's question and dump those into the prompt.</p>
<p>I emphasized that RAG doesn't <em>have</em> to use embeddings: you can build a great RAG system on top of full-text keyword-based search as well. You can also combine the two in a hybrid search system.</p>
<p>I argued that every time a new long context model comes out people inevitably argue that "RAG is dead". I don't think long context will ever kill RAG - no matter how long your context you'll still have more data than can fit in it. But I do think that LLM tool calling for search, especially <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/21/ai-assisted-search/#o3-and-o4-mini-are-really-good-at-search">as demonstrated by o3 and o4-mini</a>, is a better approach than classic RAG where you try once to find relevant documents and then attempt to answer the question without looping.</p>
<p>The next section of the workshop had no slides but is the section I was most excited about: <strong><a href="https://building-with-llms-pycon-2025.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools.html#tools">tool usage</a></strong>.</p>
<p>I talked through the pattern where LLMs can call tools and introduced the brand new tool functionality I added to LLM <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/14/llm-adds-support-for-tools/">in the latest alpha release</a>.</p>

  <p>The key idea is to have a privileged LLM that runs tools and interacts with the user but is <em>never exposed</em> to tokens from an untrusted source, and a quarantined LLM that sees that stuff and can perform actions such as summarization.</p>
<p>Untrusted tokens, or processed summaries of untrusted tokens, are never sent to the priviledged LLM. It instead can handle variable names like SUMMARY1 and direct those to be shown to the user.</p>

  <p>Evals are the LLM equivalent of unit tests: automated tests that help you tell how well your system is working.</p>
<p>Unfortunately LLMs are non-deterministic, so traditional unit tests don't really work.</p>
<p>If you're lucky you might be able to develop a suite of questions that can be evaluated on correct or incorrect answers - examples of emails that should be flagged as spam, for example.</p>
<p>More creative tasks are harder to evaluate. How can you tell if your LLM system that creates vegetarian cheesecake recipes is doing a good job? Or more importantly if tweaks you made to the prompt cause it to do a <em>better</em> or <em>worse</em> job?</p>
<p>LLM as a judge is a pattern that can help here - carefully prompting an LLM during your evaluation runs to help decide if an answer is better.</p>
<p>This whole area continues to be one of the hardest to crack - but also one of the most valuable. Having a great eval suite for your own application domain is a huge competitive advantage - it means you can adopt more models and iterate on your prompts with much more confidence.</p>
<p>I've collected a bunch of notes <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/evals/">in my evals tag</a>. I strongly recommend Hamel Husain's writing on this topic, in particular:</p>

## [DRAFT] Collaborative Text Editing without CRDTs or OT

date: 2025-05-15, updated: 2025-05-15, from: Matt Weidner blog

This blog post describes an alternative, straightforward approach to collaborative text editing, without Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) or Operational Transformation (OT). By making text editing flexible and easy to DIY, I hope that the approach will let you create rich collaborative apps that are challenging to build on top of a one-size-fits-all CRDT/OT library

## My own RSS reader

date: 2025-05-15, from: Lean Rada's blog


<p>I started making my own RSS reader webapp (<a href="https://reedybear.bearblog.dev/getting-started-with-feed-readers/" target="_blank">a what reader?</a>). It can be accessed at <a href="https://leanrada.com/tools/rss?ref=rss" target="_blank"><code>/tools/rss/</code></a>. Currently it’s hardcoded to just load my own site feed <code>leanrada.com/rss.xml</code> and that’s totally fine.</p>

<p>I made this primarily to test how my own posts get rendered in <strong>‘reader mode’</strong>.</p>

<h2>Reader mode</h2>

<p>You see, I like to incorporate interactive elements in my posts. However, custom elements and JS are scrubbed by RSS reader apps, ultimately resulting in a clean but confusing and broken experience. Even custom CSS which I use to format some graphs and illustrations are lost.</p>

<p>The same could be said for the <i>Reading mode</i> feature offered by most full-fledged web browsers today, if not their add-ons. It’s a feature that strips ‘distracting’ elements away. My own RSS reader actually uses <strong><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/readability" target="_blank">the same library</a></strong> used by Mozilla Firefox’s <i>Reader View</i>.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/my-own-rss-reader/ss.png?ref=rss" alt="Screenshot of my RSS reader" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="768">
  <figcaption>My barebones RSS reader showing a reader mode transformation of posts.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But many of my posts are not meant to be just for <em>reading</em>. I want my posts to be interactive and playable. A <em>reading</em> mode transformation is inherently incompatible. Still, I wanted to provide an RSS feed. I had to compromise.</p>

<p>An easy way out would be to omit the post body in the feed, maybe put in a summary instead, and just link to the original URL like what other feeds do. The <a href="https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml" target="_blank">BBC news feed</a> does this, for example. But that’s boring.</p>

<h2>An alt text kind of way</h2>

<p>I went with an alt text kind of way. That is, all interactive content are replaced by alternative plain text in the feed body.</p>
<fixed-grid>
  <figure>
    <img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/my-own-rss-reader/before-reading.png?ref=rss" loading="lazy" width="704" height="832">
    <figcaption>Original content</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure>
    <img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/my-own-rss-reader/after-reading.png?ref=rss" loading="lazy" width="704" height="832">
    <figcaption>Converted content</figcaption>
  </figure>
</fixed-grid>
<p>Right now it’s pretty crude — my HTML to RSS converter scans custom tags in the markup, and replaces them with the tag name in sentence case. So <code>&lt;some-demo&gt;&lt;/some-demo&gt;</code> would turn into <i>Some demo</i>.</p>

<p>It also tries to look for <code>alt</code> and <code>aria-label</code> attributes if present.</p>

<p>It’s not really a complete solution since it doesn’t cover other stuff like plain DOM-based JS stuff (non-WebComponents). I don’t think RSS readers will start running third-party JS or WebComponents anytime soon, so this is not going to be a temporary solution either.</p>

<p>The idea for the RSS reader is that it will help me continuously test these conversions, and remind myself to polish the HTML to RSS solution.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/my-own-rss-reader/alt-prelude.png?ref=rss" alt="Quote: For RSS readers: This article contains interactive content available on the original post on leanrada.com." loading="lazy" width="755" height="71">
  <figcaption>Prelude prepended to the post body when there is interactive content in the post.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Beyond just a testing tool, this RSS reader is, well, an RSS reader!</p>

<h2>It is a feed reader!</h2>

<p>Now that I’ve made an actual RSS reader, it’d be trivial to add other feeds and use this as my main reader app! I’ve always wanted to make my own feed reader.</p>

<p>I’m currently using an online service <a href="https://www.inoreader.com/" target="_blank">InoReader</a> to subscribe to and read around <strong>123 feeds</strong> in total. I could potentially switch to my own reader…? I should probably start with OPML import functionality. It would be a nice project, at least.</p>

<p>Actually, more than a feed reader, I’ve always wanted to make my own personal front page containing not just RSS feeds, but also social media posts and other stuff I follow all in one place. So many project ideas… 🤔</p>

## Impermanence

date: 2025-05-14, from: Ed Summers blog, Inkdroid

<p>
From Thich Nhat Hanh in <a
href="https://www.parallax.org/product/how-to-focus/">How to Focus</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The contemplation on impermanence can help us live our life with the
insight of impermanence so we can be free from many afflictions such as
anger, fear, and delusion. It isn’t the idea or notion of impermanence,
but the insight of impermanence that can free and save us. Impermanence
is not a negative note in the song of life. If there were no
impermanence, life would be impossible. Without impermanence how could
your little girl grow up and become a young woman? Without impermanence
how could you hope to transform your suffering? You can hope to
transform your suffering because you know it is impermanent. So
impermanence is something positive. We should say, “Long Live
Impermanence!”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think working in digital preservation, and as a memory worker in
general, it’s easy to see impermanence as a, if not the, enemy. If you
are thinking about a specific item in isolation, say a computer file, or
an archival document, it kind of is. But if you focus your attention on
the information artifact for a little bit you often come to discover
that it is actually related to other artifacts and entities that may or
may not still available, and that it is already incomplete, in many
ways. This incompleteness is what gives the artifact value, and makes it
worth preserving, and is also why exact preservation of its current
state isn’t always possible. Forever is mental trap that causes anxiety
and suffering.
</p>

## Quoting James Cowling

<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/jamesacowling/status/1922428807136608380"><p>I designed Dropbox's storage system and modeled its durability.

<p>The best thing you can do for your own durability is to choose a competent provider and then ensure you don't accidentally delete or corrupt own data on it:</p>

<li>Ideally never mutate an object in S3, add a new version instead.</li>
<li>Never live-delete any data. Mark it for deletion and then use a lifecycle policy to clean it up after a week.</li>

## LLM 0.26a0 adds support for tools!

date: 2025-05-14, updated: 2025-05-14, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/latest/changelog.html#a0-2025-05-13">LLM 0.26a0 adds support for tools!</a></strong></p>
It's only an alpha so I'm not going to promote this extensively yet, but my <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> project just grew a feature I've been working towards for nearly two years now: <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/latest/tools.html">tool support</a>!</p>
<p>I'm presenting a workshop about <a href="https://github.com/simonw/building-with-llms-pycon-2025">Building software on top of Large Language Models</a> at PyCon US tomorrow and this was the one feature I really needed to pull everything else together.</p>
<p>Tools can be used from the command-line like this (inspired by <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#defining-custom-sql-functions">sqlite-utils --functions</a>):</p>
<pre>llm --functions <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span></span>
<span class="pl-s">def multiply(x: int, y: int) -&gt; int:</span>
<span class="pl-s">    """Multiply two numbers."""</span>
<span class="pl-s">    return x * y</span>
<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>what is 34234 * 213345<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> -m o4-mini</pre>

<p>You can add <code>--tools-debug</code> (shortcut: <code>--td</code>) to have it show exactly what tools are being executed and what came back. <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/latest/usage.html#usage-tools">More documentation here</a>.</p>
<p>It's also available <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/latest/python-api.html#tools">in the Python library</a>:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-k">import</span> <span class="pl-s1">llm</span>

<span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">multiply</span>(<span class="pl-s1">x</span>: <span class="pl-smi">int</span>, <span class="pl-s1">y</span>: <span class="pl-smi">int</span>) <span class="pl-c1">-&gt;</span> <span class="pl-smi">int</span>:
    <span class="pl-s">"""Multiply two numbers."""</span>
    <span class="pl-k">return</span> <span class="pl-s1">x</span> <span class="pl-c1">*</span> <span class="pl-s1">y</span>

<span class="pl-s1">model</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s1">llm</span>.<span class="pl-c1">get_model</span>(<span class="pl-s">"gpt-4.1-mini"</span>)
<span class="pl-s1">response</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s1">model</span>.<span class="pl-c1">chain</span>(
    <span class="pl-s">"What is 34234 * 213345?"</span>,
    <span class="pl-s1">tools</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span>[<span class="pl-s1">multiply</span>]
)
<span class="pl-en">print</span>(<span class="pl-s1">response</span>.<span class="pl-c1">text</span>())</pre>

<p>There's also a <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/latest/plugins/plugin-hooks.html#register-tools-register">new plugin hook</a> so plugins can register tools that can then be referenced by name using <code>llm --tool name_of_tool "prompt"</code>.</p>
<p>There's still <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/milestone/12">a bunch I want to do</a> before including this in a stable release, most notably adding support for Python asyncio. It's a pretty exciting start though!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic/releases/tag/0.16a0">llm-anthropic 0.16a0</a> and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini/releases/tag/0.20a0">llm-gemini 0.20a0</a> add tool support for Anthropic and Gemini models, depending on the new LLM alpha.

## Building, launching, and scaling ChatGPT Images

date: 2025-05-13, updated: 2025-05-13, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/chatgpt-images">Building, launching, and scaling ChatGPT Images</a></strong></p>
Gergely Orosz landed a fantastic deep dive interview with OpenAI's Sulman Choudhry (head of engineering, ChatGPT) and Srinivas Narayanan (VP of engineering, OpenAI) to talk about the launch back in March of ChatGPT images - their new image generation mode built on top of multi-modal GPT-4o.</p>
<p>The feature kept on having new viral spikes, including one that added one million new users in a single hour. They signed up 100 million new users in the first week after the feature's launch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When this vertical growth spike started, most of our engineering teams didn't believe it. They assumed there must be something wrong with the metrics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the hood the infrastructure is mostly Python and <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi">FastAPI</a>! I hope they're sponsoring those projects (and <a href="https://github.com/encode/starlette">Starlette</a>, which is used by FastAPI under the hood.)</p>
<p>They're also using some C, and <a href="https://temporal.io/">Temporal</a> as a workflow engine. They addressed the early scaling challenge by adding an asynchronous queue to defer the load for their free users (resulting in longer generation times) at peak demand.</p>
<p>There are plenty more details tucked away behind the firewall, including an exclusive I've not been able to find anywhere else: OpenAI's core engineering principles.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ship relentlessly</strong> - move quickly and continuously improve, without waiting for perfect conditions</li>
<li><strong>Own the outcome</strong> - take full responsibility for products, end-to-end</li>
<li><strong>Follow through</strong> - finish what is started and ensure the work lands fully</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I tried getting o4-mini-high to track down a copy of those principles online and was delighted to see it either leak or hallucinate the URL to OpenAI's internal engineering handbook!</p>
<p><img alt="Thought for 1m 48s:  Here are the two places where OpenAl's “Ship  relentlessly — Own the outcome — Follow through”  checklist shows up as its core engineering  principles:  1. OpenAl Careers =&gt; Operating Principles  On the Careers page under &quot;Operating Principles,”  OpenAl codifies how every team—and especially  engineering—works together. While the page itself  doesn’t list the bullets verbatim, it's the umbrella  under which these three behavioural norms sit (Ship  relentlessly, Own the outcome, Follow through).  2. OpenAl Internal Engineering Handbook  These three tenets are drawn straight from OpenAl's  internal Engineering Handbook (employee-only), at: https://handbook.openai.com/engineering/principles  (This handbook page isn't publicly crawlable, but it's  the definitive source for how OpenAl's engineers  actually organize their day-to-day work.)" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/openai-handbook.jpg" /></p>
<p>Gergely has a whole series of posts like this called <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/t/real-world-engineering-challenges">Real World Engineering Challenges</a>, including another one <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/scaling-chatgpt">on ChatGPT a year ago</a>.

## Atlassian: “We’re Not Going to Charge Most Customers Extra for AI Anymore”. The Beginning of the End of the AI Upsell?

date: 2025-05-13, updated: 2025-05-13, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://www.saastr.com/atlassian-were-not-going-to-charge-more-customers-extra-for-ai-anymore-the-beginning-of-the-end-of-the-ai-upsell/">Atlassian: “We’re Not Going to Charge Most Customers Extra for AI Anymore”. The Beginning of the End of the AI Upsell?</a></strong></p>
Jason Lemkin highlighting a potential new trend in the pricing of AI-enhanced SaaS:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can SaaS and B2B vendors really charge even more for AI … when it’s become core?  And we’re already paying $15-$200 a month for a seat? [...]</p>
<p>You can try to charge more, but if the competition isn’t — you’re going to likely lose.  And if it’s core to the product itself … can you really charge more ultimately?  Probably … not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's impressive how quickly LLM-powered features are going from being part of the top tier premium plans to almost an expected part of most per-seat software.

## Vision Language Models (Better, Faster, Stronger)

## PDF to Text, a challenging problem

date: 2025-05-13, from: Marginallia log

The search engine has recently gained the ability to index the PDF file format. The change will deploy over a few months.
Extracting text information from PDFs is a significantly bigger challenge than it might seem. The crux of the problem is that the file format isn&rsquo;t a text format at all, but a graphical format.
It doesn&rsquo;t have text in the way you might think of it, but more of a mapping of glyphs to coordinates on &ldquo;paper&rdquo;.

## Quoting Contributing to Servo

date: 2025-05-12, updated: 2025-05-12, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<blockquote cite="https://book.servo.org/contributing.html#ai-contributions"><p>Contributions must not include content generated by large language models or other probabilistic tools, including but not limited to Copilot or ChatGPT. This policy covers code, documentation, pull requests, issues, comments, and any other contributions to the Servo project. [...]</p>
<p>Our rationale is as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Maintainer burden</strong>: Reviewers depend on contributors to write and test their code before submitting it. We have found that these tools make it easy to generate large amounts of plausible-looking code that the contributor does not understand, is often untested, and does not function properly. This is a drain on the (already limited) time and energy of our reviewers.</p>
<p><strong>Correctness and security</strong>: Even when code generated by AI tools does seem to function, there is no guarantee that it is correct, and no indication of what security implications it may have. A web browser engine is built to run in hostile execution environments, so all code must take into account potential security issues. Contributors play a large role in considering these issues when creating contributions, something that we cannot trust an AI tool to do.</p>
<p><strong>Copyright issues</strong>: [...] <strong>Ethical issues:</strong>: [...] These are harms that we do not want to perpetuate, even if only indirectly.</p></blockquote>

## o3 o4-mini o1-pro

date: 2025-05-12, updated: 2025-05-12, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p>It's interesting how much my perception of o3 as being the latest, best model released by OpenAI is tarnished by the co-release of o4-mini. I'm also still not entirely sure how to compare o3 to o1-pro, especially given o1-pro is 15x more expensive via the OpenAI API.</p>

## Pasteboard Privacy Preview in macOS 15.4

## Cursor: Security

date: 2025-05-11, updated: 2025-05-11, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://www.cursor.com/en/security">Cursor: Security</a></strong></p>
Cursor's security documentation page includes a surprising amount of detail about how the Cursor text editor's backend systems work.</p>
<p>I've recently learned that checking an organization's list of documented subprocessors is a great way to get a feel for how everything works under the hood - it's a loose "view source" for their infrastructure! That was how I confirmed that Anthropic's search features <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/21/">used Brave search</a> back in March.</p>
<p>Cursor's list includes AWS, Azure and GCP (AWS for primary infrastructure, Azure and GCP for "some secondary infrastructure"). They host their own custom models on <a href="https://fireworks.ai/">Fireworks</a> and make API calls out to OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini and xAI depending on user preferences. They're using <a href="https://turbopuffer.com/">turbopuffer</a> as a hosted vector store.</p>
<p>The most interesting section is about <a href="https://www.cursor.com/en/security#codebase-indexing">codebase indexing</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cursor allows you to semantically index your codebase, which allows it to answer questions with the context of all of your code as well as write better code by referencing existing implementations. […]</p>
<p>At our server, we chunk and embed the files, and store the embeddings in Turbopuffer. To allow filtering vector search results by file path, we store with every vector an obfuscated relative file path, as well as the line range the chunk corresponds to. We also store the embedding in a cache in AWS, indexed by the hash of the chunk, to ensure that indexing the same codebase a second time is much faster (which is particularly useful for teams).</p>
<p>At inference time, we compute an embedding, let Turbopuffer do the nearest neighbor search, send back the obfuscated file path and line range to the client, and read those file chunks on the client locally. We then send those chunks back up to the server to answer the user’s question.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When operating in <a href="https://www.cursor.com/security#privacy-mode-guarantee">privacy mode</a> - which they say is enabled by 50% of their users - they are careful not to store any raw code on their servers for longer than the duration of a single request. This is why they store the embeddings and obfuscated file paths but not the code itself.</p>
<p>Reading this made me instantly think of the paper <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jan/8/text-embeddings-reveal-almost-as-much-as-text/">Text Embeddings Reveal (Almost) As Much As Text</a> about how vector embeddings can be reversed. The security documentation touches on that in the notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Embedding reversal: academic work has shown that reversing embeddings is possible in some cases. Current attacks rely on having access to the model and embedding short strings into big vectors, which makes us believe that the attack would be somewhat difficult to do here. That said, it is definitely possible for an adversary who breaks into our vector database to learn things about the indexed codebases.</p>
</blockquote>
