## Apple Developer App 10.8

date: 2025-05-14, from: Michael Tsai

Juli Clover: As WWDC 2025 approaches, Apple has updated its Developer app to prepare for the week-long event. The refreshed version of the developer app will host the WWDC 2025 session videos, 1-on-1 labs with Apple engineers, and more. It&#8217;s still unreliable at working offline. I launched the app, and all of the screens were [&#8230;]

## External Purchase Conversion Metrics

date: 2025-05-14, from: Michael Tsai

Jacob Eiting (Mastodon): Turns out, in-app purchases are good for conversion rates. In fact, at least 30% better. That&#8217;s one of the things we found while running the first large-scale, side-by-side test of in-app vs web purchases in history.[&#8230;]The initial conversion rate for variant B is between 27% and 30%, while the equivalent web flow [&#8230;]

## Critical Warning for External Purchases in App Store

Also it says external purchases next to the &#8220;get&#8221; button It&#8217;s confusing to follow all the changes, but apparently&#8212;unlike in the US&#8212;external purchases in the [&#8230;]

## Impermanence

date: 2025-05-14, from: Ed Summers blog, Inkdroid

<p>
From Thich Nhat Hanh in <a
href="https://www.parallax.org/product/how-to-focus/">How to Focus</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The contemplation on impermanence can help us live our life with the
insight of impermanence so we can be free from many afflictions such as
anger, fear, and delusion. It isn’t the idea or notion of impermanence,
but the insight of impermanence that can free and save us. Impermanence
is not a negative note in the song of life. If there were no
impermanence, life would be impossible. Without impermanence how could
your little girl grow up and become a young woman? Without impermanence
how could you hope to transform your suffering? You can hope to
transform your suffering because you know it is impermanent. So
impermanence is something positive. We should say, “Long Live
Impermanence!”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think working in digital preservation, and as a memory worker in
general, it’s easy to see impermanence as a, if not the, enemy. If you
are thinking about a specific item in isolation, say a computer file, or
an archival document, it kind of is. But if you focus your attention on
the information artifact for a little bit you often come to discover
that it is actually related to other artifacts and entities that may or
may not still available, and that it is already incomplete, in many
ways. This incompleteness is what gives the artifact value, and makes it
worth preserving, and is also why exact preservation of its current
state isn’t always possible. Forever is mental trap that causes anxiety
and suffering.
</p>

<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/jamesacowling/status/1922428807136608380"><p>I designed Dropbox's storage system and modeled its durability.

<p>The best thing you can do for your own durability is to choose a competent provider and then ensure you don't accidentally delete or corrupt own data on it:</p>

<li>Ideally never mutate an object in S3, add a new version instead.</li>
<li>Never live-delete any data. Mark it for deletion and then use a lifecycle policy to clean it up after a week.</li>

## LLM 0.26a0 adds support for tools!

date: 2025-05-14, updated: 2025-05-14, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/latest/changelog.html#a0-2025-05-13">LLM 0.26a0 adds support for tools!</a></strong></p>
It's only an alpha so I'm not going to promote this extensively yet, but my <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> project just grew a feature I've been working towards for nearly two years now: <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/latest/tools.html">tool support</a>!</p>
<p>I'm presenting a workshop about <a href="https://github.com/simonw/building-with-llms-pycon-2025">Building software on top of Large Language Models</a> at PyCon US tomorrow and this was the one feature I really needed to pull everything else together.</p>
<p>Tools can be used from the command-line like this (inspired by <a href="https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/en/stable/cli.html#defining-custom-sql-functions">sqlite-utils --functions</a>):</p>
<pre>llm --functions <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span></span>
<span class="pl-s">def multiply(x: int, y: int) -&gt; int:</span>
<span class="pl-s">    """Multiply two numbers."""</span>
<span class="pl-s">    return x * y</span>
<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>what is 34234 * 213345<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> -m o4-mini</pre>

<p>You can add <code>--tools-debug</code> (shortcut: <code>--td</code>) to have it show exactly what tools are being executed and what came back. <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/latest/usage.html#usage-tools">More documentation here</a>.</p>
<p>It's also available <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/latest/python-api.html#tools">in the Python library</a>:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-k">import</span> <span class="pl-s1">llm</span>

<span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">multiply</span>(<span class="pl-s1">x</span>: <span class="pl-smi">int</span>, <span class="pl-s1">y</span>: <span class="pl-smi">int</span>) <span class="pl-c1">-&gt;</span> <span class="pl-smi">int</span>:
    <span class="pl-s">"""Multiply two numbers."""</span>
    <span class="pl-k">return</span> <span class="pl-s1">x</span> <span class="pl-c1">*</span> <span class="pl-s1">y</span>

<span class="pl-s1">model</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s1">llm</span>.<span class="pl-c1">get_model</span>(<span class="pl-s">"gpt-4.1-mini"</span>)
<span class="pl-s1">response</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s1">model</span>.<span class="pl-c1">chain</span>(
    <span class="pl-s">"What is 34234 * 213345?"</span>,
    <span class="pl-s1">tools</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span>[<span class="pl-s1">multiply</span>]
)
<span class="pl-en">print</span>(<span class="pl-s1">response</span>.<span class="pl-c1">text</span>())</pre>

<p>There's also a <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/latest/plugins/plugin-hooks.html#register-tools-register">new plugin hook</a> so plugins can register tools that can then be referenced by name using <code>llm --tool name_of_tool "prompt"</code>.</p>
<p>There's still <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/milestone/12">a bunch I want to do</a> before including this in a stable release, most notably adding support for Python asyncio. It's a pretty exciting start though!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic/releases/tag/0.16a0">llm-anthropic 0.16a0</a> and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini/releases/tag/0.20a0">llm-gemini 0.20a0</a> add tool support for Anthropic and Gemini models, depending on the new LLM alpha.

## Building, launching, and scaling ChatGPT Images

date: 2025-05-13, updated: 2025-05-13, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/chatgpt-images">Building, launching, and scaling ChatGPT Images</a></strong></p>
Gergely Orosz landed a fantastic deep dive interview with OpenAI's Sulman Choudhry (head of engineering, ChatGPT) and Srinivas Narayanan (VP of engineering, OpenAI) to talk about the launch back in March of ChatGPT images - their new image generation mode built on top of multi-modal GPT-4o.</p>
<p>The feature kept on having new viral spikes, including one that added one million new users in a single hour. They signed up 100 million new users in the first week after the feature's launch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When this vertical growth spike started, most of our engineering teams didn't believe it. They assumed there must be something wrong with the metrics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the hood the infrastructure is mostly Python and <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi">FastAPI</a>! I hope they're sponsoring those projects (and <a href="https://github.com/encode/starlette">Starlette</a>, which is used by FastAPI under the hood.)</p>
<p>They're also using some C, and <a href="https://temporal.io/">Temporal</a> as a workflow engine. They addressed the early scaling challenge by adding an asynchronous queue to defer the load for their free users (resulting in longer generation times) at peak demand.</p>
<p>There are plenty more details tucked away behind the firewall, including an exclusive I've not been able to find anywhere else: OpenAI's core engineering principles.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ship relentlessly</strong> - move quickly and continuously improve, without waiting for perfect conditions</li>
<li><strong>Own the outcome</strong> - take full responsibility for products, end-to-end</li>
<li><strong>Follow through</strong> - finish what is started and ensure the work lands fully</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I tried getting o4-mini-high to track down a copy of those principles online and was delighted to see it either leak or hallucinate the URL to OpenAI's internal engineering handbook!</p>
<p><img alt="Thought for 1m 48s:  Here are the two places where OpenAl's “Ship  relentlessly — Own the outcome — Follow through”  checklist shows up as its core engineering  principles:  1. OpenAl Careers =&gt; Operating Principles  On the Careers page under &quot;Operating Principles,”  OpenAl codifies how every team—and especially  engineering—works together. While the page itself  doesn’t list the bullets verbatim, it's the umbrella  under which these three behavioural norms sit (Ship  relentlessly, Own the outcome, Follow through).  2. OpenAl Internal Engineering Handbook  These three tenets are drawn straight from OpenAl's  internal Engineering Handbook (employee-only), at: https://handbook.openai.com/engineering/principles  (This handbook page isn't publicly crawlable, but it's  the definitive source for how OpenAl's engineers  actually organize their day-to-day work.)" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/openai-handbook.jpg" /></p>

That&#8217;s a feature that&#8217;s still common on budget phones and some mid-range models, but most premium phone makers have gone all-in on wireless audio (or USB-C dongles).

## Atlassian: “We’re Not Going to Charge Most Customers Extra for AI Anymore”. The Beginning of the End of the AI Upsell?

date: 2025-05-13, updated: 2025-05-13, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://www.saastr.com/atlassian-were-not-going-to-charge-more-customers-extra-for-ai-anymore-the-beginning-of-the-end-of-the-ai-upsell/">Atlassian: “We’re Not Going to Charge Most Customers Extra for AI Anymore”. The Beginning of the End of the AI Upsell?</a></strong></p>
Jason Lemkin highlighting a potential new trend in the pricing of AI-enhanced SaaS:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can SaaS and B2B vendors really charge even more for AI … when it’s become core?  And we’re already paying $15-$200 a month for a seat? [...]</p>
<p>You can try to charge more, but if the competition isn’t — you’re going to likely lose.  And if it’s core to the product itself … can you really charge more ultimately?  Probably … not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's impressive how quickly LLM-powered features are going from being part of the top tier premium plans to almost an expected part of most per-seat software.

## PDF to Text, a challenging problem

date: 2025-05-13, from: Marginallia log

The search engine has recently gained the ability to index the PDF file format. The change will deploy over a few months.
Extracting text information from PDFs is a significantly bigger challenge than it might seem. The crux of the problem is that the file format isn&rsquo;t a text format at all, but a graphical format.
It doesn&rsquo;t have text in the way you might think of it, but more of a mapping of glyphs to coordinates on &ldquo;paper&rdquo;.

## Quoting Contributing to Servo

date: 2025-05-12, updated: 2025-05-12, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<blockquote cite="https://book.servo.org/contributing.html#ai-contributions"><p>Contributions must not include content generated by large language models or other probabilistic tools, including but not limited to Copilot or ChatGPT. This policy covers code, documentation, pull requests, issues, comments, and any other contributions to the Servo project. [...]</p>
<p>Our rationale is as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Maintainer burden</strong>: Reviewers depend on contributors to write and test their code before submitting it. We have found that these tools make it easy to generate large amounts of plausible-looking code that the contributor does not understand, is often untested, and does not function properly. This is a drain on the (already limited) time and energy of our reviewers.</p>
<p><strong>Correctness and security</strong>: Even when code generated by AI tools does seem to function, there is no guarantee that it is correct, and no indication of what security implications it may have. A web browser engine is built to run in hostile execution environments, so all code must take into account potential security issues. Contributors play a large role in considering these issues when creating contributions, something that we cannot trust an AI tool to do.</p>
<p><strong>Copyright issues</strong>: [...] <strong>Ethical issues:</strong>: [...] These are harms that we do not want to perpetuate, even if only indirectly.</p></blockquote>

## Cursor: Security

date: 2025-05-11, updated: 2025-05-11, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://www.cursor.com/en/security">Cursor: Security</a></strong></p>
Cursor's security documentation page includes a surprising amount of detail about how the Cursor text editor's backend systems work.</p>
<p>I've recently learned that checking an organization's list of documented subprocessors is a great way to get a feel for how everything works under the hood - it's a loose "view source" for their infrastructure! That was how I confirmed that Anthropic's search features <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/21/">used Brave search</a> back in March.</p>
<p>Cursor's list includes AWS, Azure and GCP (AWS for primary infrastructure, Azure and GCP for "some secondary infrastructure"). They host their own custom models on <a href="https://fireworks.ai/">Fireworks</a> and make API calls out to OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini and xAI depending on user preferences. They're using <a href="https://turbopuffer.com/">turbopuffer</a> as a hosted vector store.</p>
<p>The most interesting section is about <a href="https://www.cursor.com/en/security#codebase-indexing">codebase indexing</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cursor allows you to semantically index your codebase, which allows it to answer questions with the context of all of your code as well as write better code by referencing existing implementations. […]</p>
<p>At our server, we chunk and embed the files, and store the embeddings in Turbopuffer. To allow filtering vector search results by file path, we store with every vector an obfuscated relative file path, as well as the line range the chunk corresponds to. We also store the embedding in a cache in AWS, indexed by the hash of the chunk, to ensure that indexing the same codebase a second time is much faster (which is particularly useful for teams).</p>
<p>At inference time, we compute an embedding, let Turbopuffer do the nearest neighbor search, send back the obfuscated file path and line range to the client, and read those file chunks on the client locally. We then send those chunks back up to the server to answer the user’s question.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When operating in <a href="https://www.cursor.com/security#privacy-mode-guarantee">privacy mode</a> - which they say is enabled by 50% of their users - they are careful not to store any raw code on their servers for longer than the duration of a single request. This is why they store the embeddings and obfuscated file paths but not the code itself.</p>
<p>Reading this made me instantly think of the paper <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jan/8/text-embeddings-reveal-almost-as-much-as-text/">Text Embeddings Reveal (Almost) As Much As Text</a> about how vector embeddings can be reversed. The security documentation touches on that in the notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Embedding reversal: academic work has shown that reversing embeddings is possible in some cases. Current attacks rely on having access to the model and embedding short strings into big vectors, which makes us believe that the attack would be somewhat difficult to do here. That said, it is definitely possible for an adversary who breaks into our vector database to learn things about the indexed codebases.</p>
</blockquote>
