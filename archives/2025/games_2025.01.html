<p>With just over a week left to its fundraising campaign, the

$495,000 the developer says it’ll need to fully pay for “salaries,
outsourcing, and asset creation,” but it’s enough to bring the […]</p>

Ages mechanic. A game of Civ 7 will span three different Ages —
Antiquity, Exploration, and Modern — but players will maintain the same
leader throughout. In 2024, Polygon had a hands-on […]</p>
