<p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">
The first batch of digital computers emerge directly following WWII. The
hallmark of this generation is uniqueness: no two computers are the
same. However, there is a machine that bucks that trend. The IAS
Machine, built in Princeton in the late 1940s, served as the inspiration
for at least a dozen later computers. But how similar were these
Princeton-class computers? What exactly was so special about the IAS
Machine? And how does good ’ol Johnny von Neumann get tied up in all of
this?

20th birthday Django! Here’s my talk on Django Origins from Django’s
10th</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-13, updated: 2025-07-13, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
Today is the
<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2025/jul/13/happy-20th-birthday-django/">20th
anniversary</a> of
<a href="https://github.com/django/django/commit/d6ded0e91bcdd2a8f7a221f6a5552a33fe545359">the
first commit</a> to the public Django repository!
</p>
<p>
Ten years ago we threw a multi-day 10th birthday party for Django back
in its birthtown of Lawrence, Kansas. As a personal celebration of the
20th, I’m revisiting the talk I gave at <em>that</em> event and writing
it up here.
</p>
<p>
Here’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqii_iX0RTs">the YouTube
video</a>. Below is a full transcript, plus my slides and some
present-day annotations.

<h4>
Django Origins (and some things I have built with Django)
</h4>
<p>
<em>Presented 11th July 2015 at Django Birthday in Lawrence, Kansas</em>
</p>
<p>
My original talk title, as you’ll see on your programs, was “Some Things
I’ve Built with Django.” But then I realized that we’re here in the
birthplace of Django, celebrating the 10th birthday of the framework,
and nobody’s told the origin story yet. So, I’ve switched things around
a little bit. I’m going to talk about the origin story of Django, and
then if I have time, I’ll do the self-indulgent bit and talk about some
of the projects I’ve shipped since then.
</p>
<p>
I think Jacob’s introduction hit on something I’ve never really realized
about myself. I do love shipping things. The follow-up and the long-term
thing I’m not quite so strong on. And that came to focus when I was
putting together this talk and realized that basically every project I’m
going to show you, I had to dig out of the Internet Archive.
</p>
<p>
<em>Ten years on from writing this talk I’m proud that I’ve managed to
overcome my weakness in following-up - I’m now actively maintaining a
bewildering array of projects, having finally figured out how to
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/26/productivity/">maintain
things</a> in addition to creating them!</em>
</p>
<p>
But that said, I will tell you the origin story of Django.

Job opportunity: Web programmer/developer

I interrupt this blogging hiatus to announce a job opportunity.

World Online, my employer here in beautiful Lawrence, Kansas, is looking for another Web programmer to help build cool stuff for our three sites, ljworld.com, lawrence.com and kusports.com ...
" style="max-width: 100%" />
<div>
<a style="float: right; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: none; padding-left: 1em;" href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/13/django-birthday/#django-birthday02.jpg">#</a>
<p>
For me, the story starts very much like Jacob’s. I was reading RSS feeds
back in 2003, and I saw
<a href="https://www.holovaty.com/writing/211/">this entry on Adrian’s
blog</a>, talking about a job opportunity for a web programmer or
developer in Lawrence, Kansas.
</p>
<p>
Now, I was in England. I was at university. But my university had just
given me the opportunity to take a year abroad, to take a year out to do
an internship year in industry. My girlfriend at the time was off to
Germany to do her year in industry. So I was like, well, you know, do I
stay at university? And then this comes along.
</p>
<p>
So I got in touch with Adrian and said, you know, could this work as a
year-long internship instead? And he was reading my blog and I was
reading his blog, and we knew that we aligned on a bunch of things. So
we thought we’d give it a go.
</p>
<p>
Now, if you look through this job ad, you’ll see that this is all about
expert knowledge of PHP and experience designing and maintaining
databases, particularly MySQL. So this was a PHP and MySQL gig.
</p>
<p>
But when I arrived in Kansas, we quickly realized that we were both kind
of over PHP. You know, we’d both built substantial systems in PHP, and
we were running up against the limits of what you can do in PHP and have
your code still be clean and maintainable.
</p>
<p>
And at the same time, we were both reading
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020324174618/http://diveintomark.org/">Mark
Pilgrim’s blog</a> (archive link). Mark Pilgrim had been publishing Dive
into Python and making a really strong case for why Python was a great
web language.
</p>
<p>
So we decided that this was the thing we wanted to do. But we both had
very strong opinions about how you should build websites. Things like
URL design matters, and we care about the difference between get and
post, and we want to use this new thing called CSS to lay out our web
pages. And none of the existing Python web frameworks really seemed to
let us do what we wanted to do.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="django-birthday03.jpg" class="slide">

<a style="float: right; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: none; padding-left: 1em;" href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/13/django-birthday/#django-birthday03.jpg">#</a>
<p>
Now, before I talk more about that, I’ll back up and talk about the
organization we’re working for, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Journal-World">Lawrence
Journal World</a>.
</p>
<p>
David <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDsqFD4pDy4">gave a great
introduction</a> to why this is an interesting organization. Now, we’re
talking about a newspaper with a circulation of about 10,000, like a
tiny newspaper, but with a world-class newsroom, huge amounts of money
being funneled into it, and like employing full-time software developers
to work at a local newspaper in Kansas.
</p>
</div>

<div id="django-birthday04.jpg" class="slide">
<img loading="lazy" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/django-birthday/django-birthday04.jpg" alt="Rob Curley (and a photo of Rob)" style="max-width: 100%" />
<div>
<a style="float: right; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: none; padding-left: 1em;" href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/13/django-birthday/#django-birthday04.jpg">#</a>
<p>
And part of what was going on here was this guy. This is Rob Curley.
He’s been mentioned a few times before already.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="django-birthday05.jpg" class="slide">
<img loading="lazy" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/django-birthday/django-birthday05.jpg" alt="Unofficial mission statement: “build cool shit”

<div>
<a style="float: right; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: none; padding-left: 1em;" href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/13/django-birthday/#django-birthday05.jpg">#</a>
<p>
And yeah, Rob Curley set this unofficial mission statement that we
“build cool shit”. This is something that Adrian would certainly never
say. It’s not really something I’d say. But this is Rob through and
through. He was a fantastic showman.
</p>
<p>
And this was really the appeal of coming out to Lawrence, seeing the
stuff they’d already built and the ambitions they had.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="django-birthday06.jpg" class="slide">
<img loading="lazy" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/django-birthday/django-birthday06.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Lawrence.com - Focus on Kansas. Community blogs, calendars, merch, links to movies, video games, eating out and more." style="max-width: 100%" />
<div>
<a style="float: right; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: none; padding-left: 1em;" href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/13/django-birthday/#django-birthday06.jpg">#</a>
<p>
This is Lawrence.com. This is actually the Lawrence.com written in PHP
that Adrian had built as the sole programmer at the Lawrence Journal
World. And you should check this out. Like, even today, this is the best
local entertainment website I have ever seen. This has everything that
is happening in the town of Lawrence, Kansas population, 150,000 people.
Every gig, every venue, all of the stuff that’s going on.
</p>
<p>
And it was all written in PHP. And it was a very clean PHP code base,
but it was really stretching the limits of what it’s sensible to do
using PHP 4 back in 2003.
</p>
<p>
So we had this goal when we started using Python. We wanted to
eventually rebuild Lawrence.com using Python. But in order to get there,
we had to first build – we didn’t even know it was a web framework. We
called it the CMS.
</p>

<a style="float: right; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: none; padding-left: 1em;" href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/13/django-birthday/#django-birthday07.jpg">#</a>
<p>
And so when we started working on Django, the first thing that we
shipped was actually this website. We had a lot of the six-news
Lawrence. This is the six-news Lawrence – six-news is the TV channel
here – six-news Lawrence weather page.
</p>
<p>
And I think this is pretty cool. So Dan Cox, the designer, was a
fantastic illustrator. We actually have this illustration of the famous
Lawrence skyline with each panel could be displayed with different
weather conditions depending on the weather.
</p>
<p>
And in case you’re not from Kansas, you might not have realized that the
weather is a big deal here. You know, you have never seen more excited
weathermen than when there’s a tornado warning and they get to go on
local news 24 hours a day giving people updates.
</p>
</div>

<div id="django-birthday08.jpg" class="slide">

<div>
<a style="float: right; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: none; padding-left: 1em;" href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/13/django-birthday/#django-birthday08.jpg">#</a>
<p>
So we put the site live first. This was the first ever Django website.
We then did the rest of the 6 News Lawrence website.
</p>
<p>
And this – Adrian reminded me this morning – the launch of this was
actually delayed by a week because the most important feature on the
website, which is clearly the photograph of the news people who are on
TV, they didn’t like their hairdos. They literally told us we couldn’t
launch the website until they’d had their hair redone, had the headshots
retaken, had a new image put together. But, you know, image is important
for these things.
</p>
<p>
So anyway, we did that. We did six-news Lawrence. And by the end of my
year in Kansas, Adrian had rewritten all of Lawrence.com as well.
</p>

<div id="django-birthday09.jpg" class="slide">

<p>
So this is the Lawrence.com powered by Django. And one thing I think is
interesting about this is when you talk to like David Heinemeier Hansson
about Rails, he’ll tell you that Rails is a framework that was extracted
from Basecamp. They built Basecamp and then they pulled out the
framework that they used and open sourced it.
</p>
<p>
I see Django the other way around. Django is a framework that was built
up to create Lawrence.com. Lawrence.com already existed. So we knew what
the web framework needed to be able to do. And we just kept on iterating
on Django or the CMS until it was ready to produce this site here.

<p>
And for me, the moment I realized that we were onto something special
was actually when we built this thing. This is a classic Rob Curley
project. So Rob was the boss. He had the crazy ideas and he didn’t care
how you implemented them. He just wanted this thing done.
</p>
<p>
And he came to us one day and said, you know, the kids’ little league
season is about to start. Like kids playing softball or baseball.
Whatever the American kids with bats thing is. So he said, kids’ little
league season is about to start. And we are going to go all out.

<p>
And we’re going to have 360 degree, like, interactive photos of all of
the pitches in Lawrence, Kansas, that these kids are playing games on.
</p>
<p>
They actually did send a couple of interns out with a rig to take 360

of these different places.

<p>
And he said – and it starts in three days. You’ve got three days to put
this all together.
</p>
<p>
And we pulled it off because Django, even at that very early stage, had
all of the primitives you needed to build 360 degree interactives. That
was all down to the interns. But we had all of the pieces we needed to
pull this together.

<p>
And the reason is that I was a really big fan of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Space">Office Space</a>.
And if we had the Tornado, we could produce TPS reports, which I thought
would be amazing.
</p>
<p>
But unfortunately, this being Kansas, the association of Tornadoes isn’t
actually a positive one.
</p>
<p>
Private Dancer, Physgig, Lavalia, Pithy – yeah. I’m very, very pleased
that they picked the name that they did.

<p>
So one of our philosophies was build cool shit. The other philosophy we
had was what we called “Wouldn’t it be cool if?”
</p>
<p>
So there were no user stories or careful specs or anything. We’d all sit
around in the basement and then somebody would go “Wouldn’t it be cool
if…”, and they’d say something. And if we thought it was a cool idea,
we’d build it and we’d ship it that day.
</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/django-birthday/django-birthday20.jpg" alt="Lawrence.com featured audio page - a list of bands each with links to their music and information about where they are playing in town this week." style="max-width: 100%" />

<a style="float: right; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: none; padding-left: 1em;" href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/13/django-birthday/#django-birthday20.jpg">#</a>
<p>
And my favorite example of “Wouldn’t it be cool if?” – this is a classic
Adrian one – is “Wouldn’t it be cool if the downloads page on
Lawrence.com featured MP3s you could download of local bands?” And
seeing as we’ve also got the schedule of when the bands are playing, why
don’t we feature the audio from bands who you can go and see that week?
</p>
<p>
So this page will say, “OK Jones are playing on Thursday at the
Bottleneck. Get their MP3. Listen to the radio station.” We had a little
MP3 widget in there. Go and look at their band profile. All of this
stuff.
</p>
<p>
Really, these kinds of features are what you get when you take 1970s
relational database technology and use it to power websites, which –
back in 2003, in the news industry – still felt incredibly cutting edge.
But, you know, it worked.
</p>
<p>
And that philosophy followed me through the rest of my career, which is
sometimes a good idea and often means that you’re left maintaining
features that seemed like a good idea at the time and quickly become a
massive pain!

After I finished my internship, I finished my degree in England and then
ended up joining up with Yahoo. I was actually working out of the Yahoo
UK office but for a R&amp;D team in the States. I was there for about a
year and a half.
</p>
<p>
One of the things I learned is that you should never go and work for an
R&amp;D team, because the problem with R&amp;D teams is you never ship.
I was there for a year and a half and I basically have nothing to show
for it in terms of actual shipped features.
</p>
<p>
We built some very cool prototypes. And actually, after I left, one of
the projects I worked on,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Eagle">Yahoo FireEagle</a>,
did end up getting spun out and turned into a real product.

Compare their horoscope with our recent news stories!

A very close friend or a member of your current peer group -- who means a great deal to you -- has recently found it necessary to go out of their way to tick you off. At least, that&#39;s the way it seems. It&#39;s worked, too -- better than it should have. You&#39;re not just angry, you&#39;re furious. Before you let go and let them have it, be sure you&#39;re right. Feeling righteous is far better than feeling guilty

<p>
But there is one project – the first project I built at Yahoo using
Django that I wanted to demonstrate. This was for Yahoo’s internal hack
day. And so Tom Coates and myself, who were working together, we decided
that we were going to build a mashup, because it was 2005 and mashups
were the cutting edge of computer science.
</p>
<p>
So we figured, OK, let’s take the two most unlikely Yahoo products and
combine them together and see what happens. My original suggestion was
that we take Yahoo Dating and Yahoo Pets. But I was told that actually
there was this thing called Dogster and this other thing called Catster,
which already existed and did exactly that.
</p>
<p>
So the next best thing, we went for Yahoo News and Yahoo Horoscopes. And
what we ended up building – and again, this is the first Django
application within Yahoo – was Yahoo Astronewsology.
</p>
<p>
And the idea was you take the news feed from Yahoo News, you pull out
anything that looks like it’s a celebrity’s name, look up their birth
date, use that to look up their horoscope, and then combine them on the
page. And in a massive stroke of luck, we built this the week that Dick
Cheney
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Cheney_hunting_accident">shot
his friend in the face</a> while out hunting.
</p>
<p>
Dick Cheney’s horoscope for that week says, “A very close friend who
means a great deal to you has found it necessary to go out of their way
to tick you off. You’re not just angry, you’re furious. Before you let
go and let them have it, be sure you’re right. Feeling righteous is far
better than feeling guilty.”
</p>
<p>
And so if Dick Cheney had only had only been reading his horoscopes,
maybe that whole situation would have ended very differently.

<p>
So after Yahoo, I spent a while doing consulting and things, mainly
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/openid/">around OpenID</a>
because I was determined to make OpenID work. I was absolutely convinced
that if OpenID didn’t take off, just one company would end up owning
single sign-on for the entire internet, and that would be a total
disaster.
</p>
<p>
And with hindsight, it didn’t quite happen. Facebook login looked like
it was going to do that a few years ago, but these days there’s enough
variety out there that I don’t feel like we all have to submit to our
Facebook masters.
</p>
<p>
But, you know, I was enjoying freelancing and consulting and so on. And
then I ended up going for coffee with somebody who worked for
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/">The Guardian</a>.
</p>
<p>
I’m sure you’ve all heard of The Guardian. It’s one of England’s most
internationally focused newspapers. It’s a very fine publication. And I
realized that I really missed working in a newsroom environment. And I
was incredibly jealous of people like Adrian, who’d gone off to the
Washington Post and was doing data journalism there, and Derek Willis as
well, who bounced from the Post and The New York Times. There was all of
this cool data journalism stuff going on.
</p>
<p>
And The Guardian’s pitch was basically, we’ve been building a CMS from
scratch in Java with a giant team of engineers, and we’ve built it and
it’s really cool, but we’re not shipping things quickly. We want to
start exploring this idea of building things much faster to fit in with
the news cycle.
</p>
<p>
And that was a very, very tempting thing for me to get involved with. So
I went to work for The Guardian.
</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/django-birthday/django-birthday24.jpg" alt="Photo of Simon Rogers, looking like a man who can find you the right data." style="max-width: 100%" />
<div>
<a style="float: right; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: none; padding-left: 1em;" href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/13/django-birthday/#django-birthday24.jpg">#</a>
<p>
And The Guardian have a really interesting way of doing onboarding of
new staff. The way they do it is they set you up on coffee dates with
people from all over the organization. So one day you’ll be having
coffee with somebody who sells ads, and the next day it’ll be the deputy
editor of the newsroom, and the next day it’ll be a journalist
somewhere. And each of these people will talk to you and then they’ll
suggest other people for you to meet up with. So over the first few
weeks that you’re there, you meet a huge variety of people.
</p>
<p>
And time and time again, as I was talking to people, they were saying,
“You know what? You should go and talk to Simon Rogers, this journalist
in the newsroom.”
</p>
<p>
This is Simon Rogers. I went down to talk to him, and we had this
fascinating conversation. So Simon is a journalist. He worked in the
newsroom, and his speciality was gathering data for The Guardian’s
infographics. Because they are in the paper. They post, they have graphs
and charts and all sorts of things like that that they publish.
</p>
<p>
It turns out that Simon was the journalist who knew how to get that data
out of basically any source you can imagine. If you wanted data, he
would make some phone calls, dig into some government contacts and
things, and he’d get those raw numbers. And all of the other journalists
thought he was a bit weird, because he liked hanging out and editing
Excel spreadsheets and stuff.
</p>
<p>
So I said to him halfway through this conversation, “Just out of
interest, what do you do with those Excel spreadsheets?” And he’s like,
“Oh, I keep them all on my hard drive.” And showed me this folder with
hundreds and hundreds of meticulously researched, properly citable news
quality spreadsheets full of data about everything you could imagine.
And they lived on his hard drive and nowhere else.
</p>
<p>
And I was like, “Have you ever talked to anyone in the engineering
department upstairs?” And we made this connection.
</p>
<p>
And so from then on, we had this collaboration going where he would get
data and he’d funnel it to me and see if we could, see if I or someone
else in the engineering department at Guardian could do something fun
with it.

<p>
And so that was some of the most rewarding work of my career, because
it’s journalism, you know, it’s news, it’s stuff that matters. The
deadlines are ridiculous. If a news story breaks and it takes you three
weeks to turn around a piece of data journalism around it, why did you
even bother? And it’s perfect for applying Django to.
</p>
<p>
So the first story I got to work on at the Guardian was actually one of
the early WikiLeaks things. This is before WikiLeaks was like massively
high profile. But quite early on, WikiLeaks leaked a list of all of the
members of the British National Party, basically the British Nazis. They
leaked a list of all of their names and addresses.
</p>
<p>
And the Guardian is an ethical newspaper, so we’re not going to just
publish 18,000 people’s names and addresses. But we wanted to figure out
if there was something we could do that would make use of that data but
wouldn’t be violating anyone’s individual privacy.
</p>
<p>
And so what we did is we took all of the addresses, geocoded them,
figured out which parliamentary constituency they lived in, and used
that to generate a heat map that’s actually called a choropleth map, I
think, of the UK showing where the hotspots of BNP activity were.
</p>
<p>
And this works because in the UK a parliamentary constituency is,
they’re designed to all have around about the same population. So if you
just like make the color denser for the larger numbers of BNP members,
you get this really interesting heat map of the country.
</p>
</div>

<div id="django-birthday26.jpg" class="slide">
<img loading="lazy" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/django-birthday/django-birthday26.jpg" alt="A photo of that same map shown in a paper newspaper" style="max-width: 100%" />
<div>
<a style="float: right; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: none; padding-left: 1em;" href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/13/django-birthday/#django-birthday26.jpg">#</a>
<p>
And what was really cool about this is that I did this using SVG,
because we have an infographics department with Illustrator who are good
at working with SVG. And it’s very easy with an SVG file with the right
class names on things to set colors on different regions.
</p>
<p>
And because we produced it in SVG, we could then hand it over to the
print department, and the next day it was out in the paper. It was like
a printed thing on paper, on like dead trees distributed all over the
country, which I thought was super cool.
</p>
<p>
So that was the first data journalism project that we did at The
Guardian. And it really helped prove that given the right data sets and
like the right tools and a bit of freedom, you can do some really cool
things.
</p>
<p>
The first few times I did this, I did it by hand. Then we had The
Guardian’s first hack day and I was like, well okay, I’m going to build
a little self-service tool for our infographics journalists to like dump
in a bunch of CSV numbers and get one of these maps out of it.
</p>
<p>
So I built this tool. I didn’t have anywhere official to deploy it, so I
just ran it on my Linux desktop underneath my desk. And they started
using it and putting things in the paper and I kind of forgot about it.
And every now and then I get a little feature request.
</p>
<p>
A few years after I left The Guardian, I ran into someone who worked
there. And he was like, yeah, you know that thing that you built? So we
had to keep your desktop running for six months after you left. And then
we had to like convert it into a VMware instance. And as far as I know,
my desktop is still running as a VMware instance somewhere in The
Guardian.
</p>
<p>
Which ties into the Simon database, I guess. The hard thing is building
stuff is easy. Keeping it going it turns out is surprisingly difficult.

<p>
This was my favorite project at The Guardian. There was
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_parliamentary_expenses_scandal">a
scandal in the UK a few years ago</a> where it turned out that UK
members of parliament had all been fiddling their expenses.
</p>
<p>
And actually the background on this is that they’re the lowest paid MPs
anywhere in Europe. And it seems like the culture had become that you
become an MP and on your first day somebody takes you aside and goes,
look, I know the salary is terrible. But here’s how to fill your
expenses and make up for it.
</p>
<p>
This was a scandal that was brewing for several years. The Guardian had
actually filed freedom of information requests to try and get these
expense reports. Because they were pretty sure something dodgy was going
on. The government had dragged their heels in releasing the documents.
</p>
<p>
And then just when they were a month before they finally released the
documents, a rival newspaper, the Telegraph, managed to get hold of a
leaked copy of all of these expenses. And so the Telegraph had 30 days
lead on all of the other newspapers to dig through and try and find the
dirt.
</p>
<p>
So when they did release the expenses 30 days later, we had a race on
our hands because we needed to analyze 20,000 odd pages of documents.
Actually, here it says 450,000 pages of documents in order to try and
find anything left that was newsworthy.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="django-birthday28.jpg" class="slide">
<img loading="lazy" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/django-birthday/django-birthday28.jpg" alt="Page 34 of Janet Dean&#39;s Incidental Expenses Provision 2007/08

<div>
<a style="float: right; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: none; padding-left: 1em;" href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/13/django-birthday/#django-birthday28.jpg">#</a>
<p>
And so we tackled this with crowdsourcing. We stuck up a website. We
told people, we told Guardian readers, come to this website, hit the
button, we’ll show you a random page from someone’s expenses. And then
you can tell us if you think it’s not interesting, interesting, or we
should seek an investigative reporter on it.
</p>
</div>

<div id="django-birthday29.jpg" class="slide">

<p>
And one of the smartest things we did with this is we added a feature
where you could put in your postcode, we’d figure out who your MP was,
and then we would show you their smug press photo. You know, their smug
face next to all of their expense claims that they’d filed.
</p>
<p>
And this was incredibly effective. People were like, “Ooh, you look so
smug. I’m going to get you.” And once we put this up, and within 18
hours, our community had burned through hundreds of thousands of pages
of expense documents trying to find this stuff.
</p>

<p>
And again, this was built in Django. We had, I think, five days warning
that these documents are coming out. And so it was a total, like, I
think I built a proof of concept on day one. That was enough to show
that it was possible. So I got a team with a designer and a couple of
other people to help out. And we had it ready to go when the document
dump came out on that Friday.
</p>
<p>
And it was pretty successful. We dug up some pretty interesting stories
from it. And it was also just a fantastic interactive way of engaging
our community. And, you know, the whole crowdsourcing side of it was
super fun.
</p>
<p>
So I guess the thing I’ve learned from that is that, oh, my goodness,
it’s fun working for newspapers. And actually, if you – the Lawrence
Journal world, sadly, no longer has its own technology team. But there
was a period a few years ago where they were doing some cracking data
journalism work. Things like tracking what the University of Kansas had
been using its private jet for, and letting people explore the data
around that and so on.
</p>
<p>
The other thing we did at the Guardian, this is going back to Simon
Rogers, is he had all of these spreadsheets on his hard drive. And we’re
like, okay, we should really try and publish this stuff as raw data.
Because living on your hard drive under your head is a crying shame.
</p>
<p>
And the idea we came up with was essentially to start something we
called
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2009/mar/10/blogpost1">the
Data blog</a> and publish them as Google spreadsheets. You know, we
spent a while thinking, well, you know, what’s the best format to
publish these things in? And we’re like, well, they’re in Excel. Google
spreadsheets exists and it’s pretty good. Let’s just put a few of them
up as Google sheets and see what people do with them.
</p>
<p>
And it turns out that was enough to build this really fun community of
data nerds around the Guardian’s data blog who would build their own
visualizations. They’d dig into the data. And it meant that we could get
all sorts of – like, we could get so much extra value from the work that
we were already doing to gather these numbers for the newspaper. That
stuff was super fun.

<p>
Now, while I was working at the Guardian, I also got into the habit of
building some projects with my girlfriend at the time, now my wife
Natalie. So Natalie and I have skill sets that fit together very nicely.
She’s a front-end web developer. I do back-end Django stuff. I do just
enough ops to be dangerous. And so between the two of us, we can build
websites.

<p>
The first things we worked on together is a site which I think some
people here should be familiar with, called Django People. The idea was
just, you know, the Django community appears to be quite big now. Let’s
try and get people to stick a pin on a map and tell us where they are.
</p>
<p>
Django People still exists today. It’s online thanks to a large number
of people constantly bugging me at Django Cons and saying, look, just
give us the code and the data and we’ll get it set up somewhere so it
can continue to work. And that’s great. I’m really glad I did that
because this is the one project that I’m showing you today which is
still available on the web somewhere. (<em>2025 update: the site is no
longer online.</em>)
</p>
<p>
But Django People was really fun. And the thing we learned from this, my
wife and I, is that we can work together really well on things.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="django-birthday33.jpg" class="slide">
<img loading="lazy" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/django-birthday/django-birthday33.jpg" alt="/dev/fort

<div>
<a style="float: right; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: none; padding-left: 1em;" href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/13/django-birthday/#django-birthday33.jpg">#</a>
<p>
The other side project we did was much more of a collaborative effort.
Again, this no longer exists, or at least it’s no longer up on the web.
And I’m deeply sad about this because it’s my favorite thing I’m going
to show you.
</p>
<p>
But before I show you the project, I’ll show you how we built it. We
were at a BarCamp in London with a bunch of our new friends and somebody
was showing photographs of this Napoleonic sea fortress that they had
rented out for the weekend from an organization in the UK called
<a href="https://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/">the Landmark Trust</a>, who
basically take historic buildings and turn them into vacation rentals as
part of the work to restore them.
</p>
<p>
And we were like, “Oh, wouldn’t it be funny if we rented a castle for a
week and all of us went out there and we built stuff together?” And then
we were like, “That wouldn’t be funny. That would be freaking amazing.”
</p>
<p>
So we rented this place. This is called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Clonque">Fort Clonque</a>.
It’s in the Channel Islands, halfway between England and France. And I
think it cost something like $2,000 for the week, but you split that
between a dozen people and it’s like youth hostel prices to stay in a
freaking fortress.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="django-birthday34.jpg" class="slide">
<img loading="lazy" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/django-birthday/django-birthday34.jpg" alt="Group photos of people hanging out on the fort with their laptops." style="max-width: 100%" />

<p>
So we got a bunch of people together and we went out there and we just
spent a week. We called it <a href="https://devfort.com/">/dev/fort</a>.
We spent a week just building something together.
</p>
</div>

<p>
And the thing we ended up building was called Wildlife Near You. And
what Wildlife Near You does is it solves the eternal question, “Where is
my nearest llama?”
</p>

<div id="django-birthday36.jpg" class="slide">

<p>
Once again, this is a crowdsourcing system. The idea is that you go to
wildlifenearyou.com and you’ve just been on a trip to like a nature park
or a zoo or something. And so you create a trip report saying, “I went
to the Red Kite feeding station and I saw a common raven and a common
buzzard and a red kite.” And you import any of your photos from Flickr
and so forth.

<a style="float: right; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: none; padding-left: 1em;" href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/13/django-birthday/#django-birthday38.jpg">#</a>
<p>
And you build up this profile saying, “Here are all the places I’ve been
and my favorite animals and things I’ve seen.”
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="django-birthday39.jpg" class="slide">
<img loading="lazy" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/django-birthday/django-birthday39.jpg" alt="Search &quot;llamas&quot; near &quot;brighton&quot; - shows Ashdown Forest Llama Farm." style="max-width: 100%" />

<p>
And then once we’ve got that data set, we can solve the problem. You can
say, “Search for llamas near Brighton.” And it’ll say, “Your nearest
llama is 18 miles away and it’ll show you pictures of llamas and all of
the llama things.”
</p>
</div>

<div id="django-birthday40.jpg" class="slide">

<p>
And we have species pages. So here’s the red panda page. 17 people love
red pandas. You can see them at Taronga Zoo.
</p>

<div id="django-birthday41.jpg" class="slide">

<p>
And then our most viral feature was we had all of these photos of red
pandas, but how do we know which is the best photo of a red panda that
we should highlight on the red panda page? So we basically built Hot or
Not for photographs of wildlife.
</p>
<p>
So it’s like, “Which marmot photo is better?” And you say, “Well,
clearly the one on the right.” And it’s like, “Okay, which skunk photo
is better?”
</p>
<p>
I was looking at the logs and people would go through hundreds and
hundreds of photos. And you’d get scores and you can see, “Oh, wow, my
marmot photo is the second best marmot photo on the whole website.”
</p>

<p>
So that was really fun. And then we eventually took it a step further
and said, “Okay, well, this is really fun, but this is a website that
you have to type on, right?” And meanwhile, mobile phones are now
getting HTML5 geolocation and stuff. So can we go a step further?
</p>
<p>
So we built owlsnearyou.com. And what owlsnearyou.com does is you type
in the location, and it says, “Your nearest owl is 49 miles away.” It’s
a spectacle owl at London Zoo. It was spotted one year ago by Natalie.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="django-birthday43.jpg" class="slide">

<a style="float: right; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: none; padding-left: 1em;" href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/13/django-birthday/#django-birthday43.jpg">#</a>
<p>
And if you went here on a mobile phone– If you went here on a device
that supported geolocation, it doesn’t even ask you where you live. It’s
just like, “Oh, okay, here’s your nearest owl.”
</p>
<p>
And I think we shipped lions near you and monkeys near you and a couple
of other domains, but owlsnearyou.com was always my favorite.
</p>
<p>
So looking at this now, we should really get this stuff up and running
again. It was freaking amazing. Like, this for me is the killer app of
all killer apps.
</p>
<p>
(<em>We did eventually bring this idea back as
<a href="https://www.owlsnearme.com/">www.owlsnearme.com</a>, using data
from <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/">iNaturalist</a> - that’s

<div id="django-birthday44.jpg" class="slide">
<img loading="lazy" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/django-birthday/django-birthday44.jpg" alt="‘Bugle is a Twitter-like

<p>
So there have actually been a bunch of Devforts since then. One of the
things we learned from Devfort is that building applications– If you
want to do a side project, doing one with user accounts and logins and
so on, it’s a freaking nightmare. It actually took us almost a year
after we finished on the fort to finally ship Wildlife Near You because
there were so many complexities. And then we had to moderate it and keep
an eye on it and so on.
</p>
<p>
So if you look at the more recent Devforts, they’ve taken that to heart.
And now they try and ship things which just work and don’t require
ongoing users logging in and all of that kind of rubbish.
</p>
<p>
But one of the other projects I wanted to show you that came out of a
Devfort was something called Bugle. And the idea of Bugle is Bugle is a
Twitter-like application for groups of hackers collaborating in a
castle, fort, or other defensive structure who don’t have an internet
connection.
</p>
</div>

<div id="django-birthday45.jpg" class="slide">

<p>
This was basically to deal with Twitter withdrawal when we were all on
the fort together and we had an internal network. So Bugle, looking at
it now, we could have been Slack! We could have been valued at $2
billion.
</p>
<p>
Yeah, Bugle is like an internal Twitter clone with a bunch of extra
features like it’s got a paste bin and to-do lists and all sorts of
stuff like that.

<div id="django-birthday46.jpg" class="slide">

<p>
And does anyone here know Ben Firshman? I think quite a few people do.
Excellent. So Ben Firshman was out on a Devfort and I did a “Wouldn’t it
be cool if” on him. I said, “Wouldn’t it be cool if all of our Twitter
apps and our phones talked to Bugle instead on the network?”
</p>

<p>
And so if you
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/bugle_project/blob/master/README.md#magic-twitter-support">go
and look on GitHub</a>, I bet this doesn’t work anymore. But he did add
magic Twitter support where you could run a local DNS server, redirect
Twitter to Bugle and we cloned, he cloned enough of the Twitter API that
like Twitter apps would work and it would be able to Bugle instead.
</p>
<p>
We wanted to do a Devfort in America. You don’t really have castles and
forts that you can rent for the most part. If anyone knows of one,
please come and talk to me because there’s a distinct lack of defensible
structures at least of the kind that we are used to back in Europe.

So I’m running out of time, but that’s OK because the most recent
project, Lanyrd, is something which most people here have probably
encountered.

<p>
So anyway, we got married, we quit our jobs, I had to leave the Guardian
because we wanted to spend the next year or two of our lives just
traveling around the world, doing freelancing work on our laptops and so
on.
</p>
<p>
We got as far as Morocco, we were six months in, when we contracted food
poisoning in Casablanca and we were too sick to keep on travelling, so
we figured we needed to like, you know, and it was also Ramadan, so it
was really hard to get food and stuff. So we rented an apartment for two
weeks and said, “Okay, well, since we’re stuck for two weeks, let’s like
finish that side project we’ve been talking about and ship it and see if
anyone’s interested.”
</p>
</div>

<div id="django-birthday51.jpg" class="slide">
<img loading="lazy" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/django-birthday/django-birthday51.jpg" alt="Lanyrd screenshot: Your contacts&#39; calendar. Shows 303 conferences your Twitter contacts are interested in." style="max-width: 100%" />

<a style="float: right; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: none; padding-left: 1em;" href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/13/django-birthday/#django-birthday51.jpg">#</a>
<p>
So we shipped Lanyrd, which was built around the idea of helping people
who use Twitter find conferences and events to go to. What we hadn’t
realised is that if you build something around Twitter, especially back
in 2010, it instantly goes viral amongst people who use Twitter.
</p>
<p>
So that ended up cutting our honeymoon short, and we actually applied
for Y Combinator from Egypt and ended up spending three years building a
startup and like hiring people and doing that whole thing.
</p>
<p>
(<em>Natalie wrote more about our startup in
<a href="https://blog.natbat.net/post/61658401806/lanyrd-from-idea-to-exit-the-story-of-our">Lanyrd:
from idea to exit - the story of our startup</a>.</em>)
</p>
<p>
The only thing I’ll say about that is everything in the… Startups have
to give the impression that everything’s super easy and fun and cool all
the time, because people say, “How’s your startup going?” And the only
correct answer is, “Oh man, it’s amazing. It’s doing so well.” Because
everyone has to lie about the misery, pain, anguish and stress that’s
happening behind the scenes.
</p>
<p>
So it was a very interesting three years, and we built some cool stuff
and we learnt a lot, and I don’t regret it, but do not take startups
lightly.

<p>
So a year and a half ago, we ended up selling Lanyrd to Eventbrite and
moving out to San Francisco. And at Eventbrite, I’ve been mostly on the
management team building side of things, but occasionally managing to
sneak some code out as well.
</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/django-birthday/django-birthday53.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the My Events page on Eventbrite - at the top is an orange bar showing SQL render time and number of templates and log lines and requests." style="max-width: 100%" />

<p>
The one thing I want to show you from Eventbrite, because I really want
to open source this thing, is again at Hack Day, we built a tool called
the Tikibar, which is essentially like the Django debug toolbar, but
it’s designed to be run in production. Because the really tough things
to debug don’t happen in your dev environment. They happen in production
when you’re hitting a hundred million row database or whatever.
</p>
<p>
And so the Tikibar is designed to add as little overhead as possible,
but to still give you detailed timelines of SQL queries that are
executing and service calls and all of that kind of stuff. It’s called
the Tikibar because I really like Tikibars.
</p>

<div id="django-birthday54.jpg" class="slide">
<img loading="lazy" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/django-birthday/django-birthday54.jpg" alt="The orange bar is now expanded, it shows a line for each SQL query with a timeline indicating how long each one took." style="max-width: 100%" />

<a style="float: right; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: none; padding-left: 1em;" href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/13/django-birthday/#django-birthday54.jpg">#</a>
<p>
And the best feature is if a page takes over 500 milliseconds to load,
the eyes on the Tiki God glow red in disapproval at you.
</p>
<p>
If anyone wants a demo of that, come and talk to me. I would love to get
a few more instrumentation hooks into Django to make this stuff easier.
</p>

<a href="https://github.com/eventbrite/tikibar">eventbrite/tikibar</a>
on GitHub.</em>)

<p>
This has been a whistle-stop tour of the highlights of my career working
with Django.
</p>
<p>
And actually, in putting this presentation together, I realized that
really it’s that Rob Curley influence from all the way back in 2003. The
reason I love Django is it makes it really easy to build cool shit and
to ship it. And, you know, swearing aside, I think that’s a reasonable
moral to take away from this.

<p>
I put this annotated version of my 10 year old talk together using a few
different tools.
</p>
<p>
I fetched the audio from YouTube using
<a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp">yt-dlp</a>:
</p>
<pre><code>yt-dlp -x --audio-format mp3 \
  "https://youtube.com/watch?v=wqii_iX0RTs"
</code></pre>
<p>
I then ran
<a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/django-birthday.mp3">the
mp3</a> through
<a href="https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper">MacWhisper</a> to
generate an initial transcript. I cleaned that up by
<a href="https://claude.ai/share/5fc8a371-7000-4373-afd6-91f1347680cc">pasting
it into Claude Opus 4</a> with this prompt:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Take this audio transcript of a talk and clean it up very slightly - I
want paragraph breaks and tiny edits like removing ums or “sort of” or
things like that, but other than that the content should be exactly as
presented.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I converted
<a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/django-birthday.pdf">a
PDF of the slides</a> into a JPEG per page using this command (found
with the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-cmd">llm-cmd</a>
plugin):
</p>
<pre><code>pdftoppm -jpeg -jpegopt quality=70 django-birthday.pdf django-birthday
</code></pre>
<p>
Then I used my
<a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/annotated-presentations">annotated
presentations tool</a>
(<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Aug/6/annotated-presentations/">described
here</a>) to combine the slides and transcript, making minor edits and
adding links using Markdown in that interface.
