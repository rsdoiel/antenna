date: 2025-06-16, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

Did tracking-based advertising just get blown up in Europe? As I read it (in an English translation here), an appeals court in Brussels ruled consent notifications on websites illegal. Your interpretation may vary. Here are some I&#39;ve gathered to help with that: Jamie Smith: Targeting ads using Real Time Bidding is now illegal, and how will [&#8230;]

Show me where &#8220;your privacy choices&#8221; are kept, and how compliance can be audited, and I might believe corporate promises. On our Apple TV 4k box, an app for a subscription service (e.g. Netflix, Prime, CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, Haystack, whatever) usually opens with a message that gives one the choice to &#8220;Ask app not [&#8230;]

date: 2025-06-16, from: Robert Reich's blog

Corporations are just brands and talent. Surrendering to Trump sacrifices both.

Yesterday began with the horrific news that a gunman had shot two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses in what Minnesota governor Tim Walz said appeared to be a &#8220;politically motivated assassination.&#8221; State representative Melissa Hortman, who was the top Democrat in the Minnesota House, and her husband, Mark, both died in the attack at their home in Brooklyn Park, a city near Minneapolis.

## Back to “normal”

date: 2025-06-16, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

Not to pick on this person, it&#8217;s a funny protest sign &#8212; but it seems like a lot of people are thinking like we&#8217;re in a &#8220;one weird trick&#8221; (impeachment) scenario and, once we get that done, we&#8217;ll magically return to some type of &#8220;normal&#8221; and we can all go home&#8230; but the concept of [&#8230;]

## If the Ten Commandments Reflected Reality

date: 2025-06-15, updated: 2025-06-15, from: Ron Garret

And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying: I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.You shall have no other gods before me.&nbsp; Except Donald Trump.&nbsp; If he says something that goes against my word, you shall believe him and not me.You shall not make for yourself any image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters

In a year or two it will be possible to create a perfect TV version of any person. No longer can you say any person has to die eventually and go away. And we can have anyone back we want.

## Some media is for relaxation

date: 2025-06-15, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/15/machoGeneralTaco.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">BTW, this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/13/opinion/obama-save-america-trump.html">piece</a> in the NYT has a <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/15/joerogue.png">bit of wisdom</a> that I had not considered because I don't listen to Joe Rogan it would never occur to me. He's relaxing white noise, chatting in the background while you play a game or write a blog post or text message on your phone, or just think about something unrelated. I forgot that mode of media consumption. I'm always on the hunt for that kind of content. That's why sports games are so good. You can almost completely tune out, knowing they'll replay the best stuff. </p>
<p>Reminds of a meeting we had a <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Berkman">Berkman</a> in the early days of podcasting. Most of the faculty were of course not on board with what we were doing, possibly believing that it threatened public radio (didn't turn out that way at all, they made incredibly good use of podcasting). One of the guys from <a href="https://www.prx.org/">PRX</a> which was also incubating there at the time, said at me in a challenging way -- You get the best info from public radio! Right? I thought for a minute and realized this was a good question. No, I said, it's relaxing, I can tune out while I'm driving or walking around town. Loud groans. But it's so true. Now it's great when there's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dept._Q">TV series</a> that really <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=disbelief">catches</a> your attention, I love that too, but most of my media-ingesting time is with white noise, background relaxation. The world is still okay when the background noise on MSNBC are still on the air between the ever more disgusting ads for diseases I probably will never get. </p>
<p>There must be a better way. </p>
<p>It's like the canaries in a coalmine. When they go off the air that's when you really have to start worrying! </p>
<p>BTW, PRX was a good idea. Brilliant actually. Distribute the content from the public radio sources that generate too much to the ones in less populated areas where they don't generate enough. Podcasting blew that up -- but PRX adjusted their approach, and became a distributor of podcasting. That's an entrepreneur's approach. The were able to pivot and continue to make a contribution to this day. </p>
<p>I often wonder how we missed the opportunity to build a great media incubator at Harvard in the 00s. We were right there, and the backer of Berkman wanted entrepreurial projects, I found out at the reunion two summers ago. We had it, were there, if only.. Heh when you get to be my age there's lots of that. </p>
<p>Also I wonder how I missed the potential of WordPress all those years. Ships passing in the night. But we're there now, so..</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-06-15, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/06/15/tacoShells.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I figured that yesterday's army march in DC would have caused clashes with the police in more places than it did, perhaps due to false flag attacks "from the left" at one of the many No King Day parades around the country. I thought this was the moment when it would all melt down. America's Reichstad Fire. If it were an episode of Mission Impossible or Batman, it would definitely have gone that way. I bet there were plans hatched on open chat channels between various Cabinet members and their families, and probably Elon Musk via an interpreter, to coordinate. I was also surprised there weren't any Tesla Cybertrucks in yesterday's parade. I guess the honeymoon is really over. Anyway, they had to have had a plan, but I keep forgetting this is not Generalissimo Trump, rather it's TV President "Taco" Trump. I think they had a plan and he lost his nerve at the last minute. Instead, the Maga in Minnesota lit a different fuse, assassinating the speaker of the state house. That's a line that hadn't yet been crossed, but you knew the day would come. It's here.

When Trump was on trial in NYC he begged for support from his base, no one showed up. The cops prepared for rallies that never showed up.

## Working together

date: 2025-06-15, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>It's not just the government that's afraid of small groups of people working together. Big tech companies also. And startups hoping to sell out to big companies. </p>

They keep selling us out and we keep acting as if we show them that they're doing it in a way they understand they'll get on our side. But they can't. “It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it,” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upton_Sinclair">wrote</a> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/21810-it-is-difficult-to-get-a-man-to-understand-something">Upton Sinclair</a> in 1935. It's still true 90 years later. Another great philosopher, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Moonves">Les Moonves</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/02/les-moonves-trump-cbs-220001">said</a> in 2016, "It may not be good for America, but it's damn good for CBS," referring to Trump's run for president. It was good presumably because of increased viewership resulting more ad revenue. I'm sure it's still true today, though CBS stopped boasting about it in public.
