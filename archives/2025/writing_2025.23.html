The next hero in the John Wick franchise is Eve (Ana de Armas), a
ballerina/assassin who is trained under the Ruska Roma, which is helmed
by the Director (Anjelica Huston) who we learned about in <em>John Wick:
Chapter 2</em>. Eve is being set up to become a contract assassin and
ward protector, a similar role to John Wick. She has spent 12 years in
this training and it has become a life she is now accustomed to.

We are currently living through a new Golden Age of television, which,
over the last twenty-five years, has expanded from the major network
television platform (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox) to the addition of cable
television (HBO, Showtime, AMC, FX, etc.), and into the current
expansion of streamers (Amazon Prime, Hulu, Netflix, Apple TV, etc.).
That’s three platforms dedicated to episodic storytelling, amounting to
hundreds upon hundreds of current TV shows — with thousands of series
that came and went before them.  <br><br>And all of them started with
one particular type of episode — a <span style="font-weight: bold;">TV

You don’t always need outright inspiration as a screenwriter. Sometimes
you just need <em>ignition</em> — a spark that fires up your creative
juices to get them flowing from your mind to your fingers, and through
your fingers to the keys. <br><br>Whether you’re stuck on page 30,
struggling to find a character’s voice — or just trying to write
<em>anything</em> — these 75 creative writing prompts and exercises can
help. Think of these prompts and exercises as a craft-driven toolbox
that you can go to anytime.

Sharks don’t hold a great reputation when it comes to movies. They’re
predators and killers - you simply don’t see cult classics called
‘Puppynado’. Instead, sharks dominate horror movies, lurking in the dark
water and attacking unsuspecting tourists, or wreaking havoc on fishing
boats.

much a retelling, like Gregory Maguire’s <strong>Wicked</strong>, but a

“The most important thing that I’ve learned as a storyteller is that I
have to treat every character in the show as though they’re the lead in
the show, and they are never doing anything so that I can prompt a move
from another character. They are doing things that are true to what they
want and their motivation. So that’s what makes that architecture hard,
because you know you want things to happen, but they have to happen
coming out of character, not coming out of what the room wants to see
happen. So it’s like the merging of those two. We know what architecture
we want, but if it doesn’t feel true to the character, the character
wouldn’t do it. Every time, you’ve got to say no, even though it’s
tempting, because that is who you have to protect – your characters,”
says Jennie Snyder Urman, creator and showrunner of <em>Matlock</em>,
about creating story architecture in a series. <br><br>On today’s
episode, we talk with Jennie Snyder Urman, who created the reboot of
<em>Matlock</em> starring Kathy Bates as Madeline Matlock. We chat about
reinventing the beloved character once played by Andy Griffith, the joy
of building a show around an older female lawyer and the generational
changes in social attitudes women experience, and the sacrifices women
often make when it comes to sexual harassment, including Matty
herself. <br><br>“[Matty] realizes now, coming back [to the legal
profession], what it cost her. And it’s not like every day she was
thinking about it. It was just, ‘Oh my gosh, I made these changes to
avoid this. And why do I have to make these changes? Why didn’t that
person make the changes so I could be in the space where I was
comfortable?’ And I think what’s so exciting about Maddie is that she’s
still learning new things at 75. I think there’s also a little bit of a
wish fulfillment, that you can still evolve, and you still learn, and
you still feel new things,” says Urman. <br><br>To hear more about
<em>Matlock</em>, what we can expect from season 2, and Urman’s advice
for writers, listen to the podcast.

Screenwriting is about more than just plot—it’s about <span
style="font-weight: bold;">voice</span>. And nowhere does a
screenwriter’s voice shine more clearly than in their characters’
dialogue.<br><br>The best known screenwriters are highly regarded for
their dialogue. When you hear dialogue written by screenwriters such as
Diablo Cody, Aaron Sorkin, and Quentin Tarantino, you can recognize
their distinctive voices almost immediately. <br><br>Dialogue is more
than just words on a page. It’s action and depth. It’s how characters
flirt, fight, confess, distract, manipulate, and reveal themselves. The
best dialogue cuts just a bit deeper than exposition. You feel it
suggesting more than it is actually saying — forcing us to start hearing
or reading between the lines. That’s where the action part of dialogue
lies. <br><br>And when you ground dialogue into character and conflict,
it creates unforgettable scenes that could have otherwise been
forgettable without a little extra effort and inspiration. <br><br>With
that in mind, here are 50 dialogue prompts built specifically for
screenwriters. They are designed to inspire character-driven moments,
layered scenes, and amazing conflict (the driving force of every
scene).

The dark academia appeal remains strong for YA fans, and Lili
Wilkinson’s <strong>Unhallowed Halls </strong>takes readers into what is
now a classic setting of iso­lated elite boarding school (Agathion
College in “gloomy” Scotland), misunderstood teen (possibly pyrotechnic
Page), and professors hiding nefari­ous purposes (pretty much everyone at
Agathion). Everything about Agathion sets off

I was quite charmed by Robert Jackson Bennett’s <strong>The Tainted
Cup</strong>, though left curious about some of the politics brewing
behind its flashier world-building. With its sequel, <strong>A Drop of
Corruption</strong>, Bennett has doubled down on what I enjoyed in the
first one – a decidedly action-packed mystery
