“The most important thing that I’ve learned as a storyteller is that I
have to treat every character in the show as though they’re the lead in
the show, and they are never doing anything so that I can prompt a move
from another character. They are doing things that are true to what they
want and their motivation. So that’s what makes that architecture hard,
because you know you want things to happen, but they have to happen
coming out of character, not coming out of what the room wants to see
happen. So it’s like the merging of those two. We know what architecture
we want, but if it doesn’t feel true to the character, the character
wouldn’t do it. Every time, you’ve got to say no, even though it’s
tempting, because that is who you have to protect – your characters,”
says Jennie Snyder Urman, creator and showrunner of <em>Matlock</em>,
about creating story architecture in a series. <br><br>On today’s
episode, we talk with Jennie Snyder Urman, who created the reboot of
<em>Matlock</em> starring Kathy Bates as Madeline Matlock. We chat about
reinventing the beloved character once played by Andy Griffith, the joy
of building a show around an older female lawyer and the generational
changes in social attitudes women experience, and the sacrifices women
often make when it comes to sexual harassment, including Matty
herself. <br><br>“[Matty] realizes now, coming back [to the legal
profession], what it cost her. And it’s not like every day she was
thinking about it. It was just, ‘Oh my gosh, I made these changes to
avoid this. And why do I have to make these changes? Why didn’t that
person make the changes so I could be in the space where I was
comfortable?’ And I think what’s so exciting about Maddie is that she’s
still learning new things at 75. I think there’s also a little bit of a
wish fulfillment, that you can still evolve, and you still learn, and
you still feel new things,” says Urman. <br><br>To hear more about
<em>Matlock</em>, what we can expect from season 2, and Urman’s advice
for writers, listen to the podcast.

Screenwriting is about more than just plot—it’s about <span
style="font-weight: bold;">voice</span>. And nowhere does a
screenwriter’s voice shine more clearly than in their characters’
dialogue.<br><br>The best known screenwriters are highly regarded for
their dialogue. When you hear dialogue written by screenwriters such as
Diablo Cody, Aaron Sorkin, and Quentin Tarantino, you can recognize
their distinctive voices almost immediately. <br><br>Dialogue is more
than just words on a page. It’s action and depth. It’s how characters
flirt, fight, confess, distract, manipulate, and reveal themselves. The
best dialogue cuts just a bit deeper than exposition. You feel it
suggesting more than it is actually saying — forcing us to start hearing
or reading between the lines. That’s where the action part of dialogue
lies. <br><br>And when you ground dialogue into character and conflict,
it creates unforgettable scenes that could have otherwise been
forgettable without a little extra effort and inspiration. <br><br>With
that in mind, here are 50 dialogue prompts built specifically for
screenwriters. They are designed to inspire character-driven moments,
layered scenes, and amazing conflict (the driving force of every
scene).

The dark academia appeal remains strong for YA fans, and Lili
Wilkinson’s <strong>Unhallowed Halls </strong>takes readers into what is
now a classic setting of iso­lated elite boarding school (Agathion
College in “gloomy” Scotland), misunderstood teen (possibly pyrotechnic
Page), and professors hiding nefari­ous purposes (pretty much everyone at
Agathion). Everything about Agathion sets off

I was quite charmed by Robert Jackson Bennett’s <strong>The Tainted
Cup</strong>, though left curious about some of the politics brewing
behind its flashier world-building. With its sequel, <strong>A Drop of
Corruption</strong>, Bennett has doubled down on what I enjoyed in the
first one – a decidedly action-packed mystery
