The Steps Episode 7: Scientists walk out to protest funding cuts</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-16, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>Last Friday, over a thousand scientists from across Southern
California met to protest cuts to the NIH and other agencies. We take
you to the demonstration in Westwood and then we look at how students
are preparing for finals, a magic show, and the Gymnastics meet against
Stanford.</p>

Nepal</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-16, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>The sound of rain bouncing off the metallic wings overtakes the sound
of the jet engine. Instead of city lights and the Santa Monica
Mountains, the Himalayas rise up around the plane, dwarfing my
perception of altitude.</p>

Century</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-16, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>Above and beyond publishing journal articles, credentialing young
people and producing spectacles on the court, the field and the
gridiron, the job of a university is to keep the books.  Less visible
than some of the university’s more prominent architectural symbols, the
Michael Sadleir Collection of Nineteenth-Century British Fiction is
deeply tied to the history, and the purpose, of UCLA.</p>

<p>I am no longer allowed to buy jackets. As a chronic shopper since I
was 4 years old, my closet was stuffed with an endless supply of
jackets, vests, belts and other pieces of clothing that still had tags
on them.</p>

<p>date: 2025-03-16, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>“I was born in the greatest place on Earth.”   Pacific Palisades is
filled with spots to view the ocean sunset, but Leo Rochman’s favorite
is a cul-de-sac at the bottom of the hill in the bluffs overlooking the
coast.</p>

Giving Craft gives more than gifts to patients, encouraging creativity
at UCLA</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-16, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>The Giving Craft shows how a small gesture can go a long way. The
student-run organization, founded this past fall quarter, is open to all
students interested in crafts – no matter the medium or level of
experience, said social media manager and second-year cognitive science
student Hannah Ngo.</p>

<p>date: 2025-03-16, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>As winter quarter reaches its conclusion, it is time to revisit the
visuals that made the season dynamic. A variety of female artists
delivered unforgettable music videos for their singles, pulling from
nostalgic television programs and original concepts to craft vibrant
stories.</p>
