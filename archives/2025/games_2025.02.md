## Is it too early to say Nnedi Okorafor’s genre-bender is one of my favorite books of 2025?

date: 2025-01-15, updated: 2025-01-14, from: Polygon Website

I know it’s only Jan. 15, but I feel confident in saying that I’ve already found one of my favorite books of the year. Nnedi Okorafor’s Death of the Author, out now, is a genre-defying metafiction about the author of a hit sci-fi book, the stories she tells, and the stories others tell about her. [&#8230;]

We tend to imagine the hardest part of surviving a zombie apocalypse would be, well, the zombies. But as properties like The Last Of Us, The Walking Dead, and Navaar Jackson’s tabletop role-playing game The Corrupted show us, it’s actually other people. While there are other games that tackle the zombie trope, like Free League’s [&#8230;]

The Marvel Rivals tier list is proof of an inherent truth: not every hero (or villain) is built equally.

## Sea of Stars local co-op revived my love for turn-based RPGs
