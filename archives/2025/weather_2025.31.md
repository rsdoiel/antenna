## Tropical Storm Ivo Forecast Discussion Number 5

date: 2025-08-07, from: Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>ZCZC MIATCDEP4 ALL
TTAA00 KNHC DDHHMM
 
Tropical Storm Ivo Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
300 PM CST Thu Aug 07 2025
 
Ivo remains a very small tropical cyclone, though an intensifying 
one. Deep central convection continues to burst near the center, 
though the vertical structure of the tropical storm does appear more 
ragged with evidence that the mid-level vortex is tilted to the 
southwest of the low-level center. A helpful Metop-B scatterometer 
pass at 1643 UTC captured the tiny circulation with a max wind 
retrieval of 44 kt. Assuming this instrument undersampled the peak 
winds of the small cyclone, the initial intensity is being raised to 
50 kt for this advisory, also close to the latest objective ADT 
estimate.
 
The tropical storm continues to move quite quickly to the northwest,
with the motion estimated at 305/18 kt. The track forecast reasoning
is similar to earlier, where a strong and extensive mid-level ridge
parked over northern Mexico should keep Ivo moving quickly
west-northwestward to northwestward for the next 24 hours or so. On
this forecast track, Ivo will soon begin pulling away from the
southwestern coast of Mexico. By this weekend, the ridge begins to
weaken some and the guidance also suggests Ivo will start to become
more vertically shallow. A combination of these influences should
result in a westward turn in the track and a slowdown in the forward
motion. The track guidance for this cycle is quite similar to the
prior one, and the NHC track forecast is largely an update from
the previous one, blending the consensus aids HCCA and TVCE.
 
The intensity forecast presents a conundrum this afternoon. Ivo has 
a small inner core wind field, is over warm 29-30 C ocean waters, 
and vertical wind shear as diagnosed by SHIPS guidance is low, only 
5-10 kt. Ordinarily these variables would suggest that Ivo could 
undergo a period of rapid intensification (RI), and EC-SHIPS-RI 
guidance now has a 71 percent chance of a 30-kt increase over the 
next 24 h. However, other RI indices are lower, with DTOPS at only 
12 percent for the same threshold. There is also evidence that Ivo's 
structure is not ideal, with current visible satellite imagery 
suggesting its circulation is tilted southwest with height. This 
vertical tilt also matches the structure seen in the most recent 
HAFS-A/B model grids. This may explain why the regional-hurricane 
models are less aggressive with Ivo's intensification than SHIPS, 
and only HAFS-B briefly makes Ivo a hurricane. Thus the NHC 
intensity forecast is not as aggressive as the latest SHIPS 
guidance, only taking Ivo to a 70 kt hurricane in 24 hours. 
Thereafter, the storm will cross a sharp sea-surface temperature 
gradient, which should lead to weakening after 24 hours. Like the 
previous forecast, Ivo will likely lose its organized deep 
convection west of Baja California in about 72 hours, where the 
latest forecast shows it becoming a post-tropical remnant low. The 
NHC intensity forecast is a little above the reliable HCCA aid, but 
is lower than both SHIPS and LGEM aids.
 
Given the small radius of tropical-storm-force winds associated with
Ivo, these winds are expected to remain offshore as it begins to
move away from Mexico by tonight. However, heavy rain and rough surf
are likely to occur along portions of the southwest coast of Mexico
during the next day or so.  Outer bands of Ivo are expected to
produce locally heavy rainfall in portions of the Mexican states of
Guerrero, Michoacan de Ocampo and Colima through Friday where flash
flooding is possible.

## Tropical Storm Henriette Forecast Discussion Number 15

date: 2025-08-07, from: Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>ZCZC MIATCDEP3 ALL
TTAA00 KNHC DDHHMM
 
Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number  15
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082025
1100 AM HST Thu Aug 07 2025
 
Henriette has been producing a smaller area of deep convection than
earlier, as it seems to be struggling a bit with dry air and
sea-surface temperatures near 24 C.  The latest subjective Dvorak
current intensity estimates are 2.5/35 kt from TAFB and 1.5/25 kt
from SAB.  The latest objective estimates from UW-CIMMS range from
about 30 to 40 kt.  A recent 1914 UTC ASCAT-C pass suggests that 
Henriette has likely weakened a bit from earlier.  Based on the 
above data, the initial intensity is lowered to 40 kt for this 
advisory.
 
The motion of 280/14 kt is unchanged from the previous advisory.
This motion will continue through today as Henriette is steered by
mid-level ridging well to its north.  The cyclone will then round
the southwestern periphery of the mid-level ridge as a large
deep-layer trough approaches from the west.  These features will
cause Henriette to gradually turn toward the northwest in a couple
of days.  Very little change has been made to the NHC track
forecast, which lies near the tightly clustered consensus aids.
Confidence in the track forecast is high through the weekend, and
Henriette will not directly impact the Hawaiian Islands.
 
Henriette is expected to continue moving over cool ocean waters near 
24C for another 36 h before it begins to gradually move over 
increasing water temperatures.  The tropical storm will also 
continue moving through a very dry environment.  Most of the 
guidance shows the storm maintaining a 35-40 kt intensity during 
this time. Henriette is also expected to encounter colder than 
normal mid- and upper-level temperatures in a couple of days.  If 
Henriette survives the next 48 h or so, then strengthening would 
appear likely later in the forecast period due to increasing 
sea-surface temperatures, very low vertical wind shear, and 
decreasing mid- to upper-level temperatures as the aforementioned 
deep-layer trough approaches. The official forecast shows some 
slight weakening in the short term, followed by strengthening to a 
hurricane by day 4 well to the north of Hawaii.  The latest NHC 
forecast is near the intensity consensus and close to the higher end 
of the guidance at day 4 and 5.  It should be noted that the HAFS 
models are showing a slightly higher intensity than the NHC 
forecast.

Meanwhile, an upper-level ridge over the Southwest will shift
westward and build across much of the West by D5/Monday. Thereafter,
another upper-level trough is forecast to enter the Pacific
Northwest.

...Dry Thunderstorms: D3/Saturday - D4/Sunday...
Residual moisture beneath the ridge should allow for a continuation
of afternoon thunderstorm potential through at least D4/Sunday for
portions of the Southwest amid low environmental PWAT values and
receptive fuels. 10% probabilities have been maintained for the
region through Sunday. Thunderstorm potential may extend into early
next week though limited predictability within the weak-flow regime
beyond D4/Sunday precludes introducing any additional highlights.

...Wind/RH: D3/Saturday...
Some enhanced upper-level flow associated with the exiting trough
may linger over portions of the Southwest to result in diurnally
driven wind/RH concerns for portions of the region on D3/Saturday,
and potentially extending into D4/Sunday. For now, have added 40%
probabilities on D3/Saturday and will continue to monitor potential
for the region thereafter.

Wind/RH concerns may begin to emerge early next week for portions of
the Pacific Northwest and northern Great Basin, as enhanced flow
with the onshoring trough overspreads the region. However,
considerable spread exists among medium-range guidance regarding the
timing/placement/magnitude of this trough, precluding the
introduction of any highlights at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 1897
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0254 PM CDT Thu Aug 07 2025

Areas affected...parts of western and central North Dakota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 071954Z - 072200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Uncertainty lingers concerning potential thunderstorm
coverage and sustenance into and through 5-7 PM CDT.  However, any
sustained thunderstorm development may include rapidly intensifying
supercells accompanied by a risk for large hail, locally damaging
wind gusts  and perhaps a couple of tornadoes.

DISCUSSION...Along and southeast of a weak baroclinic zone, near the
leading edge of air impacted by outflow from now dissipated
convective development, boundary-layer air with seasonably high
moisture content is becoming characterized by moderate to strong
potential instability.  This is being supported by steep
lower/mid-tropospheric lapse rates associated a broad plume of warm
and capping elevated mixed-layer air overspreading much of the Great
Plains.  

Based on latest model output and objective analysis, the northern
periphery of the stronger capping may now be north of the surface
front, roughly near/northwest of the Dickinson through Garrison and
Minot vicinities.  However, large-scale scale ascent associated with
lower/mid-tropospheric warm advection, a subtle mid-level short wave
perturbation, and localized area of enhanced low-level convergence
might be sufficient to overcome mid-level inhibition and support the
initiation of at least isolated thunderstorm development late this
afternoon.  If this occurs, there appears potential for rapid
intensification, and the evolution of a large supercell, in the
presence of moderate to strong deep-layer shear beneath 30-40 kt
southwesterly flow around 500 mb. 

The environment appears conducive to the potential for large hail,
locally damaging surface gusts, and, despite modest low-level
hodographs, a risk for a couple of tornadoes.

Mesoscale Discussion 1896

0249 PM CDT Thu Aug 07 2025

Areas affected...Parts of central and eastern Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 071949Z - 072145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Large hail and severe wind gusts will be possible this
afternoon, especially as storms move into eastern Montana. A watch
is possible when storm intensity trends become evident.

DISCUSSION...A broad area of mid-level ascent is evident on visible
satellite imagery in southwestern Montana. This forcing has promoted
widely scattered thunderstorms early this afternoon. Mid/upper
clouds associated with this band of ascent has so far kept buoyancy
rather weak near the terrain. Farther east, surface dewpoints have
gradually increased into the low/mid 50s F to mid/upper 60s F near
the North Dakota border. Given the strong ascent, it is likely that
scattered storms will eventually develop. Lingering MLCIN is present
from around Billings eastward. This should erode some with
additional afternoon heating. The main point of uncertainty is when
storms will intensify. This will probably occur in the next 2-3
hours when storms encounter greater moisture. Strong shear and
increasing buoyancy as convection moves east will support a threat
for initial supercells capable of large hail and severe winds.
Temperature-dewpoint spreads are large enough that storms will tend
to be outflow dominant and may congeal into one or more clusters. A
watch is possible this afternoon, but timing of when this will be
needed is not clear.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0259 PM CDT Thu Aug 07 2025

Valid 072000Z - 081200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF THE NORTHERN PLAINS....

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are expected later today into tonight
across the northern Plains. The most likely corridor is centered on
North Dakota, where a few tornadoes, very large hail, and a
conditional risk for significant severe gusts are possible.

...20z Update Northern Plains...
Early afternoon surface and satellite observations show low-level
convergence increasing along the intersection of an outflow
boundary/composite front and weak lee low over eastern MT. Along and
south of the front, strong diurnal heating should gradually
destabilize a very moist air mass with dewpoints in the low 70s F.
Large to extreme CAPE is expected, owing to steep mid-level lapse
rates, though with some capping likely to remain in place with
southward extent. Rapid thunderstorm initiation appears probable
this afternoon along the low-level convergence zone and in the
higher terrain farther west as a shortwave trough proceeding the
primary mid-level wave over the Northern Rockies ejects eastward.
Initial storm mode is likely to be supercellular along or on the
immediate cool side of the surface boundary. This would initially
favor a large hail risk (some significant), and the potential for a
few tornadoes, should storms become surface based.

Tonight, the primary uncertainty continues to be small-scale storm
dynamics governing upscale growth and the potential for bowing
MCS/rear-inflow jet development. Should this occur relatively early
on in the convective evolution (as shown by some CAMs), significant
damaging winds (Gusts 80+ mph) are possible across portions of ND/SD
through tonight. However, this remains highly uncertain and
conditional. Regardless of the initial evolution, significant ascent
from the primary upper trough ejecting eastward appears robust
enough to support upscale growth with any ongoing convection and
additional storms emanating from eastern MT later tonight. This
could result in one or more clusters of strong storms capable of
damaging gusts, hail and a tornado or two. Given recent trends, have
shifted the northern bound of the level 3 Enhanced northward and
eastward across ND/MN for significant damaging wind potential.
Otherwise, see MCD #1896 and #1897 for short-term information.

..Lyons.. 08/07/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1114 AM CDT Thu Aug 07 2025/

...Eastern MT/Dakotas/Western MN...
A large upper trough is digging into the Pacific Northwest region
today, with several shortwave perturbations tracking from the
northern Great Basin into MT/ND.  One feature is currently over
eastern MT and has been fostering scattered thunderstorms across
that region.  Convection in this area is currently in a diurnal
lull, but may re-invigorate later this afternoon across parts of
central ND as daytime heating/destabilization occurs.  Backed
low-level winds, dewpoints in the 70s, and high CAPE values will
promote a favorable environment for a few supercells capable of very
large hail, a few tornadoes, and damaging wind gusts.  These storms
could persist into the evening, tracking into western MN.

Another shortwave trough currently over western ID will overspread
the mountains of ID/western MT this afternoon, promoting the
development of scattered strong storms.  This activity should
intensify further as it moves into a very moist/unstable airmass
across southeast MT, with a consensus of CAM guidance suggesting
upscale growth into a bowing complex by early evening.  As these
storms progress rapidly eastward across ND/northern SD, there
remains the potential for a swath of significant wind damage, along
with large hail and a tornado or two.  Some guidance suggests the
MCS will remain severe well into the night, affecting parts of
western/central MN.

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM NORTHEAST IA
TO NORTHEAST WI...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible on Saturday into Saturday
night from the Upper Great Lakes to the Lower Missouri Valley, and
across a portion of the central to southern High Plains. A more
concentrated swath of severe is possible from northeast Iowa to
northeast Wisconsin.

...Upper Great Lakes to the Lower MO Valley...
Have maintained the level 2-SLGT risk as-is, with primary change to
expand level 1-MRGL eastward in MI to MO. Spatial confidence is low
on mesoscale details, especially given the large spread in CAM
guidance for late D2 convective evolution upstream in MN. The
convectively modified cold front should slow its eastward
progression as the upstream shortwave trough/mid-level low stalls.
The bulk of moderately enhanced mid-level southwesterlies should
remain to the cool side of the front, with a pronounced
cross-boundary gradient from northwest to southeast. This should
generally yield multicell clustering with an uptick in intensity as
diurnal destabilization occurs from IA to upper MI. The
trailing/western portion of the daytime storm swath should be a
focus for regenerative nocturnal storm development, as a low-level
jet noses across the Lower MO Valley. Sporadic strong to isolated
severe gusts and perhaps hail may linger into Saturday night.

...Central/southern High Plains...
A cold front sweeping south on D2 should become quasi-stationary
over the southern High Plains around the TX Panhandle on D3.
Isolated storms are possible along the boundary with a threat for
sporadic microbursts amid hot temperatures south of the front. More
organized severe potential should be focused in the post-frontal
regime along the Front Range. This should be centered on northeast
CO amid stronger mid-level westerlies within the base of a stalled
trough south of a low over the southern Prairie Provinces. This
could yield a few supercells in the afternoon to evening and have
expanded the level 2-MRGL risk north. Still, confidence is low on
whether more than weak buoyancy will be present.

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE GREAT BASIN INTO
THE CENTRAL ROCKIES...

Minor changes were made to the isolated dry thunderstorm area near
the Four Corners region to shift the area slightly eastward, based
on 12z CAM guidance. Also, the Elevated area was expanded eastward
into portions of north-central Colorado where dry/breezy downslope
winds are expected amid at least marginally receptive fuels.
Otherwise, the balance of the previous forecast remains on track.
See the discussion below for more details.

..Karstens.. 08/07/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0156 AM CDT Thu Aug 07 2025/

...Synopsis...
Moderate-strong midlevel westerly flow will be in place across the
Great Basin into the central Rockies -- between a robust midlevel
trough over the northern Rockies/High Plains and midlevel
anticyclone over the southern Rockies/High Plains. 

...Great Basin into the Central Rockies...
Similar to Day 1/Thursday, a diurnally deepening boundary layer will
extend well into the moderate-strong westerly flow aloft. This will
promote an expansive overlap of single-digit to lower teens RH and
20-25 mph sustained westerly surface winds (with higher gusts).
These hot, dry, and windy conditions atop receptive fuels will lead
to another day of critical fire-weather conditions. 

...Dry Thunderstorms - Southwest into the central Rockies...
Diurnal heating/mixing beneath an established midlevel moisture
plume from the Southwest into the central Rockies will favor another
day of isolated to widely scattered high-based thunderstorms during
the afternoon. Associated inverted-V soundings and 0.50 to 0.75 inch
PW will support mostly dry storms, capable of producing
lightning-induced ignitions over dry fuels and gusty/erratic outflow
winds.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN THE EASTERN
DAKOTAS TO WESTERN LAKE SUPERIOR...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible across parts of the
Upper Midwest, mainly Friday evening into early morning Saturday.
Scattered damaging winds and large hail, along with a tornado or two
are possible.

...Synopsis...
A messy/complex setup remains evident on Friday afternoon into early
morning Saturday. In the wake of multiple MCSs on D1, guidance
consensus has trended farther east with the effective cold front by
late afternoon. This boundary should be centered on northwest MN to
eastern NE then arcing westward but pushing southward through the
central High Plains. The bulk of large-scale ascent and strong
mid/upper-level flow will lag behind this front in the northern
Great Plains, typical of amplified shortwave troughs impinging on a
ridge emanating north-northeastward from a stout anticyclone over
the Southwest. 

...Dakotas to northwest WI...
Elevated convection may be ongoing at 12Z Friday and should persist
through the day across most of ND and northern SD, within a
post-frontal environment. Isolated severe hail and strong to
marginal severe gusts are possible with this activity. Strengthening
low-level convergence and ascent along/ahead of the front should
await Friday evening, with increasing storm coverage and severe
potential into Friday night. Anafrontal aspects of the synoptic
setup and near-parallel alignment of the deep-layer shear vector
with respect to the front should support a rapid transition to
cluster/linear mode. With very large MLCAPE likely prevalent ahead
of the front, potential for a QLCS producing damaging winds may
evolve overnight. Guidance differs substantially in the corridor of
where this would be favored with split signals across northern MN or
southern MN. For this outlook cycle, have broadened the level 2-SLGT
risk and will defer to later outlooks for a potential wind-driven
ENH centered somewhere in MN. 

...Black Hills/NE Panhandle...
12Z CAM and ML guidance are insistent on at least an isolated large
hail scenario within the post-frontal environment characterized by
northerly surface winds. A lobe of decreasing buoyancy should linger
behind the front but will shift south with time. A few discrete
supercells are possible from mid-afternoon to early evening amid a
strong southwesterly mid-level jet. But much of the convection
should be quickly undercut and may become rather elevated, dependent
on timing of the front and low-level drying behind it. As such, have
deferred to the D1 outlooks for a mesoscale hail-driven SLGT.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

1138 AM CDT Thu Aug 07 2025

Valid 071700Z - 081200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE GREAT BASIN INTO
THE CENTRAL ROCKIES...

A narrow area delineating potential for isolated dry thunderstorms
was added to portions of central Idaho, northwest Wyoming, and far
southwest Montana. A small zone of isolated storms is possible in
this region this afternoon, south of more widespread activity across
Montana and vicinity, amid low PWAT values and receptive fuels.

Elsewhere, minor refinements were made to the isolated dry thunder
area near the Four Corners region, where storm potential has
decreased, along with some expansion eastward into north-central New
Mexico and south-central Colorado, based on 12z CAM guidance and
updated fuel guidance.

A minor expansion was also made to the Elevated area into
east-central Wyoming and vicinity where dry/breezy downsloping
west-southwesterly winds should extend later this afternoon.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0156 AM CDT Thu Aug 07 2025/

...Synopsis...
Within the base of a robust midlevel trough moving across the
northern Rockies, a belt of enhanced deep-layer west-southwesterly
flow will overspread the Great Basin into the central Rockies -- to
the north of an expansive midlevel anticyclone centered over the
southern Rockies.

...Great Basin into the Central Rockies...
Diurnal heating will yield deep boundary-layer mixing into the
enhanced flow aloft across the Great Basin into the central Rockies.
As a result, widespread single-digit to lower teens RH will develop
amid 20-25 mph sustained west-southwesterly surface winds. Given
increasingly dry/receptive fuels, another day of critical
fire-weather conditions are expected. 

...Dry Thunderstorms - Southwest into the Central Rockies...
Within a plume of midlevel moisture extending from the Southwest
into the central Rockies, diurnally driven high-based thunderstorms
are expected -- with a focus over the higher terrain. These storms
will be mostly dry, owing to inverted-V soundings (0.50 to 0.70 inch
PW) -- posing a risk of lightning-induced ignitions and strong
outflow winds.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1114 AM CDT Thu Aug 07 2025

Valid 071630Z - 081200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
INTO TONIGHT ACROSS MUCH OF NORTH DAKOTA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are expected later today into tonight
across the northern Plains. The most likely corridor is centered on
North Dakota, where a few tornadoes, very large hail, and
significant severe gusts are possible.

...Eastern MT/Dakotas/Western MN...
A large upper trough is digging into the Pacific Northwest region
today, with several shortwave perturbations tracking from the
northern Great Basin into MT/ND.  One feature is currently over
eastern MT and has been fostering scattered thunderstorms across
that region.  Convection in this area is currently in a diurnal
lull, but may re-invigorate later this afternoon across parts of
central ND as daytime heating/destabilization occurs.  Backed
low-level winds, dewpoints in the 70s, and high CAPE values will
promote a favorable environment for a few supercells capable of very
large hail, a few tornadoes, and damaging wind gusts.  These storms
could persist into the evening, tracking into western MN.

Another shortwave trough currently over western ID will overspread
the mountains of ID/western MT this afternoon, promoting the
development of scattered strong storms.  This activity should
intensify further as it moves into a very moist/unstable airmass
across southeast MT, with a consensus of CAM guidance suggesting
upscale growth into a bowing complex by early evening.  As these
storms progress rapidly eastward across ND/northern SD, there
remains the potential for a swath of significant wind damage, along
with large hail and a tornado or two.  Some guidance suggests the
MCS will remain severe well into the night, affecting parts of
western/central MN.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0750 AM CDT Thu Aug 07 2025

Valid 071300Z - 081200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS MUCH OF
NORTH DAKOTA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are expected later today into tonight
across the northern Plains. The most likely corridor is centered on
North Dakota, where a few tornadoes, very large hail, and
significant severe gusts are possible.

...Northern Plains...
Elevated thunderstorms are ongoing across northeastern MT this
morning, supported by warm-air advection throughout the northwestern
periphery of surface low over southeast MT. Steep mid-level lapse
rates remain in place downstream of these storms, and southwesterly
mid-level flow will persist, so the general expectation is for these
storms to continue through the morning into the early afternoon.
Cloud cover associated with these storms could result in a
differential heating zone that with create a warm-front-like feature
across northern ND. At the same time, moisture low-level
southeasterly flow will continue across the northern Plains, with
dewpoints likely in the upper 60s/low 70s across much of the region
by the early afternoon. 

The surface low over southeast MT is forecast to drift eastward this
morning towards the MT/WY/SD border intersection vicinity. To the
north of this low, the combination of low-level moisture convergence
and strengthening large-scale ascent will likely result in
convective initiation by the early afternoon. Surface dewpoints in
the upper 60s/low 70s and surface temperatures in the 80s beneath
steep mid-level lapse rates will result in an impressive
thermodynamic environment from the MT/ND border downstream into more
of ND. Most guidance suggests MLCAPE from 3000 to 4000 J/kg.
Moderate shear is also expected within this initiation zone,
supporting an initially supercellular storm mode. All severe hazards
would be possible with these supercells, including very large hail
exceeding 2" in diameter, significant severe gusts around 75 mph,
and tornadoes. Clustering and upscale growth appears probable, with
the resulting MCS then tracking eastward across ND. 

Given the extreme buoyancy and moderate westerly flow aloft, there
is some potential for the development of a robust rear inflow jet
and resulting MCS that could be qualified as a derecho. However,
confidence in the development of derecho is too low to increase wind
probabilities with this outlook. Regardless, significant wind gusts
appear possible, particularly if the previously mentioned
warm-front-like feature develops and acts as a favored corridor for
MCS propagation. Low-level southeasterly flow is also expected to be
strong enough for some potential for line-embedded tornadoes.

Additional elevated thunderstorms are possible in the wake of this
MCS amid modest warm-air advection atop the MCS outflow. Some large
hail is possible within these storms.  

...Northern High Plains...
Farther west, isolated to widely scattered supercells may develop
within a moderately unstable post-frontal regime from central into
eastern MT. Elongated hodographs and steep lapse rates will support
severe hail and wind potential with these cells. Some clustering
remains possible within this regime as well, and depending on the
evolution of downstream convection, storms that initiate in MT may
eventually spread into western/central ND late tonight with a
continued severe threat.

...Northern MO/IA into the Upper Midwest...
Elevated thunderstorms are currently ongoing across southern IA and
northern MO, supported by warm-air advection resulting from a
low-level jet that extends from the TX Panhandle through eastern KS.
Steep mid-level lapse rates are present across much of the region
(sampled by the 12Z TOP sounding), and these storms will likely
continue through the afternoon. An isolated strong wind gusts is
possible with these storms. 

Additional thunderstorms are possible later this evening farther
northeast in central/southern WI and northern IL as the low-level
jet strengthens again. Deep-layer flow will be relatively modest,
but rich moisture and moderate to strong buoyancy will support a
threat for at least isolated hail and damaging wind.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0343 AM CDT Thu Aug 07 2025

Valid 101200Z - 151200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Sunday/Day 4 to Tuesday/Day 6...
A persistent shortwave mid-level trough is forecast to remain over
the central U.S. from Sunday to Tuesday. During this time period, a
moist and unstable airmass is forecast to be in place from the
central Plains northeastward into the Great Lakes. It appears that
large-scale ascent will be weak across most of this airmass, which
will result in limited convective coverage. Although instability and
deep-layer shear should be sufficient for an isolated severe threat
each afternoon, mainly in areas that heat up the most, any potential
should remain localized.

Further north into the northern Plains, low-level moisture is
forecast to increase by midweek. In response, a moderately unstable
airmass could develop by Tuesday afternoon. In spite of this, warm
air aloft and limited large-scale ascent should keep convective
coverage very isolated. This will likely limit any related severe
threat.

...Wednesday/Day 7 and Thursday/Day 8...
From Wednesday into Thursday, a mid-level trough is forecast to move
across the northwestern U.S. Ahead of this system, a cold front is
forecast to advance southeastward across the northern Plains.
Thunderstorms would be possible near the front across the Dakotas
Wednesday afternoon, and in the upper Mississippi Valley Thursday
afternoon. An isolated severe threat would be possible for both
days. However, details concerning any potential scenario, including
the timing of the front, is highly uncertain at this time.

## Tropical Storm Henriette Forecast Discussion Number 13

<pre>955 
WTPZ43 KNHC 070846
TCDEP3
 
Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082025
1100 PM HST Wed Aug 06 2025
 
Satellite images indicate that a small burst of deep convection has 
developed just to the northwest of Henriette’s low-level center this 
evening, after several hours with not much more than a shallow cloud 
swirl.  The most recent subjective Dvorak current intensity estimate 
from TAFB was 3.0/45 kt, while the objective estimates from UW-CIMSS 
ranged between 32 to 42 kt over the past several hours.  A timely 
07/0645Z Metop-C ASCAT pass depicted several 40 kt wind barbs, with 
a single 40–45 kt wind barb noted north of the low-level center.  
The initial intensity for this advisory will be held at 45 kt, 
utilizing the ASCAT data while accounting for some undersampling and 
a known low bias at higher speeds. 

The cyclone is moving westward, or 275 degrees, at 14 kt. This 
general motion is expected to persist through Thursday, as Henriette 
continues to be steered by a strengthening subtropical ridge to its 
north.  A gradual turn toward the west-northwest and eventually 
northwest is anticipated Friday and over the weekend, as an 
amplifying longwave trough northwest of Hawaii begins to erode the 
western extent of the subtropical ridge. The northwestward motion is 
expected to continue into early next week.  The official track 
forecast remains closely aligned with the latest multi-model 
consensus aids and is nearly identical to the previous advisory.

Henriette will be moving over gradually cooling sea surface 
temperatures near 24C, while the environmental humidities 
surrounding the cyclone will drop below 50 percent.  Despite these 
hostile thermodynamic conditions, Henriette’s well-established 
circulation is likely to remain resilient due to the low-shear 
environment the cyclone will be transiting through.  As a result, 
only a slight weakening is forecast tonight, followed by little 
change in strength during the next few days.  If Henriette can 
survive the passage over the cool waters, as persistently suggested 
by the GFS and ECMWF models for several days now, re-intensification 
appears likely over the weekend and into early next week as sea 
surface temperatures warm to levels conducive for strengthening.  
The official forecast continues to reflect this, bringing Henriette 
to hurricane strength by 120 hours.  The intensity forecast is 
mostly unchanged and remains aligned best with the dynamical 
intensity consensus aid HCCA and the regional hurricane models.

## Tropical Storm Ivo Forecast Discussion Number 3

Tropical Storm Ivo Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
300 AM CST Thu Aug 07 2025
 
Ivo's satellite presentation is that of a storm that is steadily 
intensifying.  Deep convection has been continuously forming while 
the central deep overcast has been expanding through the evening.  
However, overnight scatterometer data from 0412 UTC revealed a 
dubious, at best, low-level circulation. The data suggests that 
even though the mid-level rotation appears robust, the low-level 
flow has yet to reflect such organization, likely due to Ivo's rapid 
forward motion.  The intensity is held at 35 kt based on the latest 
satellite-derived wind data.

The motion is estimated to be 295/20 kt.  Ivo is racing along the 
southern side of a strong mid-level ridge centered over the 
southwestern United States.  This motion is expected to continue 
for the next day or so which should keep the tropical cyclone 
moving parallel to, but offshore of, the coast of southwestern 
Mexico.  Around 36 h, Ivo is expected to turn more westward and slow 
down.  The latest NHC track forecast is slightly faster than the 
previous forecast and lies between the various consensus aids.
 
Ivo is still forecast to steadily strengthen over then next day or 
so.  Moderate vertical wind shear, warm sea surface temperatures, 
and a moist environment should provide the necessary conditions for 
the cyclone to reach hurricane status within the next couple of 
days.  Ivo is expected to cross over cooler waters by 72 h, which 
should induce a gradual weakening trend.  Global models predict 
increasing shear will separate the cyclone from deep convection and 
Ivo is now forecast to become post-tropical by 96 h.  The official 
intensity forecast remains at the high end of the model guidance.
 
The tropical-storm-force winds associated with Ivo are expected to
remain offshore of the coast of Mexico, however heavy rain and
rough surf are likely along portions of the southwest coast of
Mexico during the next day or so.  Outer bands of Ivo are expected 
to produce locally heavy rainfall in portions of the Mexican states 
of Guerrero, Michoacan de Ocampo and Colima through Friday. Flash 
flooding is possible.

COASTLINE...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 300 AM CST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.9N 103.0W
ABOUT 215 MI...350 KM WSW OF ACAPULCO MEXICO
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...40 MPH...65 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...WNW OR 295 DEGREES AT 23 MPH...37 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1008 MB...29.77 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
Interests along the coast of southwestern Mexico should monitor the
progress of Ivo.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 AM CST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ivo was 
located near latitude 15.9 North, longitude 103.0 West. Ivo is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 23 mph (37 km/h).  The system 
is forecast to move generally parallel to, but offshore of, the 
coast of Mexico during the next day or so and turn westward away 
from Mexico thereafter.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast, and Ivo is expected to be near hurricane
strength by the end of the week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles (55 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Ivo is expected to produce storm total
rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 6 inches,
across portions of the Mexican states of Guerrero, Michoacan de
Ocampo and Colima through Friday. This would result in an elevated
risk for flash flooding.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Depression Nine-E, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep4.shtml?rainqpf
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Ivo will be affecting the southwestern
coast of Mexico during the next couple of days. These swells are
likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
A depiction of rip current risk for the United States can be found

## Tropical Storm Henriette Forecast Discussion Number 11

Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number  11
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082025
1100 AM HST Wed Aug 06 2025
 
Henriette continues along with little change in its structure. Like 
6 h ago, it is producing a relatively small area of deep convection, 
with cold cloud tops present mostly to the north of its low-level 
center. Recent scatterometer data showed winds just above 40 kt, 
which supports maintaining the intensity at 45 kt for this 
advisory, after accounting for undersampling. The scatterometer data 
was also helpful with identifying the exact position of Henriette's 
center, which was slightly south of previous estimates.
 
No significant change was made to the NHC track forecast outside a 
slight southward adjustment based on the initial position estimate 
in the short term. Henriette is moving westward to 
west-northwestward to the south of a deep ridge centered over the 
northern east Pacific. In a few days, a trough approaching from the 
west will turn Henriette toward the northwest, taking the tropical 
cyclone north of Hawaii. The various deterministic and global 
ensemble models are all in good agreement on the forecast, so 
confidence in the track forecast is fairly high.
 
The tropical storm is still forecast to slowly weaken during the 
next few days while it moves over cool SSTs near 24C. However, once 
Henriette moves north of Hawaii, it will move over warmer waters. 
Upper-level difluent flow associated with a mid-latitude trough to 
the northwest may also provide additional support for 
intensification. As a result, most of the dynamical models forecast 
strengthening to occur near the end of the forecast period, and the 
NHC intensity forecast reflects this and is very similar to the 
previous advisory.

## Tropical Storm Ivo Forecast Discussion Number 1

Tropical Storm Ivo Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP092025
300 PM CST Wed Aug 06 2025

One-minute GOES-E visible imagery, microwave imagery and 
scatterometer data from this morning indicate that the disturbance 
south of Mexico has become much better organized. The system has 
developed banding features, and the most recent TAFB Dvorak analysis 
shows a Final-T of 2.0. The ASCAT data showed peak winds between 
30-35 kt, so advisories have been initiated on Tropical Storm Ivo, 
with an initial intensity of 35 kt.

Ivo has a relatively small circulation, but it's embedded within a 
fairly large area of deep convection. SHIPS diagnostics indicate 
that wind shear could be a limiting factor for Ivo's intensity 
during the next couple of days, but the tropical storm is in an 
otherwise conducive environment for strengthening. The NHC forecast 
follows the multi-model consensus and shows Ivo reaching hurricane 
strength within the next couple of days, but there is about 30 kt of 
spread in the intensity guidance, both above and below the official 
forecast.

Ivo is moving fairly quickly toward the west-northwest near 19 kt. A 
deep-layer ridge centered over the southwestern U.S. should steer 
Ivo parallel to the coast of Mexico for the next couple of days. 
The ridge is forecast to weaken by the weekend, causing Ivo to move 
at a slower forward speed, but by then Ivo will reach cooler SSTs 
and a more stable environment. That should cause the cyclone to 
quickly weaken and turn westward, steered primarily by low-level 
flow. The NHC track forecast is near the center of the guidance 
envelope, very close to HCCA throughout the 5-day period.

The tropical-storm-force winds associated with Ivo are expected to 
remain offshore of the coast of Mexico, however heavy rain and 
rough surf are likely along portions of the southwest coast of 
Mexico during the next day or two.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM CST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Ivo was
located near latitude 14.2 North, longitude 99.1 West. Ivo is moving
toward the west-northwest near 22 mph (35 km/h). The tropical storm 
is forecast to move generally parallel, but offshore of the coast 
of Mexico during the couple of days, and then turn westward, moving 
further from land.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is anticipated for the next couple of days. Ivo is 
forecast to be near hurricane strength by the end of the week.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Ivo is expected to produce storm total 
rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 6 inches, 
across portions of the Mexican states of Guerrero, Michoacan and 
southwestern Oaxaca through Saturday. This rainfall could lead to 
flash flooding. 

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Tropical Depression Nine-E, please see the National Weather Service 
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic available at

## Tropical Storm Henriette Forecast Discussion Number 9

date: 2025-08-06, from: Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>000
WTPZ43 KNHC 060853
TCDEP3
 
Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082025
1100 PM HST Tue Aug 05 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Henriette has changed little since the 
previous advisory, with intermittent bursts of deep convection 
continuing, primarily located over and west of the cyclone’s 
low-level center.  Recent subjective Dvorak intensity estimates from 
TAFB and SAB were 3.0/45 kt and 2.5/35 kt, respectively, while 
objective estimates from UW-CIMSS have ranged between 34 and 46 kt 
over the past several hours.  A timely 06/0525Z Metop-C ASCAT pass 
revealed several 40–45 kt wind barbs north of the low-level center. 
Based on these data, the initial intensity for this advisory remains 
45 kt.

Henriette has recently turned toward the west, or 280 degrees, at 13 
kt. This general motion is expected to persist over the next couple 
of days as the cyclone is steered by a strengthening subtropical 
ridge situated to the north.  By around 72 hours, a gradual turn 
toward the west-northwest or northwest is anticipated as an 
amplifying longwave trough northwest of Hawaii begins to erode the 
western periphery of the ridge.  The official track forecast is 
closely aligned with the latest multi-model consensus aids and 
remains very similar to the previous advisory.

Henriette is forecast to remain in a low vertical wind shear 
environment for the next several days. During this period, sea 
surface temperatures are expected to gradually decrease to near or 
slightly below 24C, while mid-level moisture drops below 50 percent. 
Despite these marginal thermodynamic conditions, Henriette’s broad 
circulation and well-established inner core should allow the system 
to remain relatively resilient in the low shear environment.  Only 
slight weakening is forecast during the next few days, followed by 
little change in strength.  Toward the end of the forecast period, 
sea surface temperatures are expected to rise again.  If the system 
manages to endure the cooler waters, as persistently suggested by 
both the GFS and ECMWF models, some re-intensification is possible.  
The official forecast reflects this potential and lies near the 
middle of the intensity guidance envelope.

Mesoscale Discussion 1890
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0240 PM CDT Tue Aug 05 2025

Areas affected...south central North Dakota and adjacent north
central South Dakota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 051940Z - 052145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Intensifying thunderstorm activity, perhaps including the
evolution of a sustained supercell appears probable by 5-7 PM CDT,
if not earlier, before transitioning to an organizing, southeastward
propagating cluster into this evening.  A severe weather watch will
likely be needed, but timing remains uncertain.

DISCUSSION...In the wake of a generally dissipating cluster of
thunderstorms spreading into the Red River Valley,
lower/mid-tropospheric warm advection is being maintained across
much of the Dakotas, on the northern periphery of a plume of warm
and capping elevated mixed-layer air.  This includes temperatures as
warm as +10 to +12 C around 700 mb, as far northeast as southwestern
North Dakota through north central and northeastern South Dakota,
beneath which stronger boundary-layer warming and destabilization is
ongoing.

Around and north through east of the Bismarck ND vicinity, the
boundary-layer has been slower to modify in the wake of the
preceding convection, but forcing for ascent has been sufficient to
overcome inhibition and support renewed thunderstorm development. 
This has been gradually increasing near the nose of a 30 kt
southerly low-level jet, which may strengthen a bit further into
early evening.  Northward advection of warmer and more moist
boundary-layer air along this axis is likely to contribute to
substantive further boundary-layer destabilization, and, at some
point, a rapid intensification of thunderstorm activity.  

Once this occurs, in the presence of strong deep-layer shear beneath
30-40 kt westerly 500 mb flow, the environment appears conducive to
the evolution of a significant supercell with potential to produce
large hail and perhaps a couple of tornadoes, before growing growing
upscale into an organizing southeastward propagating cluster by this
evening.

## Tropical Storm Henriette Forecast Discussion Number 7

Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082025
1100 AM HST Tue Aug 05 2025
 
This morning's satellite presentation consists of a convective
curved band on the west side of the cyclone and a cluster of strong
thunderstorms with cold cloud tops of -70 Celsius just to the west 
of Henriette's surface circulation center.  The initial intensity is
held at 45 kt for this advisory and is based on a blend of the
TAFB and SAB subjective and CIMSS objective intensity estimates.
 
Little change in strength is expected during the next couple of 
days, although 5-kt fluctuations are possible, while Henriette 
moves  over slightly cooler water and through an increasingly 
inhibiting thermodynamic environment.  Toward the end of the week, 
the thermodynamic environment is expected to become even more
hostile while Henriette moves over the subtropical central
Pacific waters.  Therefore, some weakening of the cyclone is 
forecast through day 5.  The official intensity forecast is based 
on the IVCN intensity consensus model and the Decay-SHIPS 
statistical aid.
 
Henriette's initial motion is estimated to be west-northwestward,
or 295/13 kt, and a west-northwestward or westward motion should 
continue through day 4 while the cyclone is steered by a strong 
mid-level ridge stretching across the subtropical Central Pacific.  
Over the weekend, Henriette is expected to turn gradually 
northwestward in response to an amplifying mid- to 
upper-tropospheric trough approaching the Hawaiian Islands from the
Central North Pacific.  The NHC track forecast is based on the 
various consensus aids and is basically an update of the previous 
advisory.

## Tropical Storm Henriette Forecast Discussion Number 5

date: 2025-08-05, from: Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>000
WTPZ43 KNHC 050842
TCDEP3
 
Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082025
1100 PM HST Mon Aug 04 2025
 
The satellite presentation of Henriette has degraded some since the 
previous advisory, with cloud tops warming and the curved band 
structure becoming more fragmented.  The latest subjective Dvorak 
intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB are both 3.0/45 kt, while 
objective estimates from UW-CIMSS have ranged from 37 to 46 kt 
during the past several hours.  Meanwhile, a timely 05/0545Z Metop-C 
ASCAT pass showed several 40-45 kt wind barbs, assisting with 
determining the initial intensity as well as the extent of the 
tropical-storm-force wind radii.  The initial intensity for this 
advisory has been held at 45 kt.

The cyclone is moving west-northwest, or 290 degrees, at 13 knots.  
This general motion is expected to continue during the next day or 
so, as Henriette moves along the southern edge of a subtropical 
ridge to the north.  Between 36 and 72 hours, a slight turn toward 
the west is forecast as the ridge strengthens north of the cyclone.  
Beyond 72 hours, a turn back toward the west-northwest or northwest 
is anticipated as an amplifying longwave trough northwest of Hawaii 
erodes the western extent of the subtropical ridge steering the 
cyclone.  The official track forecast closely follows a blend of 
the latest HCCA/TVCE/FSSE consensus guidance, and is very close to 
the track from the previous advisory.

Henriette appears to have a brief window for further intensification 
over the next 12 to 18 hours, as sea surface temperatures hover 
between 26 and 26.5C, mid-level moisture remains sufficient, and 
vertical wind shear stays light.  Little change in strength is 
expected then through 36 hours as the cyclone moves over slightly 
cooler water but close to the 26C isotherm, while shear remains 
light and the mid-levels remain moist. Beyond 36 hours, the cyclone 
is expected to move over progressively cooler waters, with mid-level 
moisture decreasing, and these conditions should lead to gradual 
weakening. The official forecast maintains Henriette as a tropical 
cyclone through 120 hours, however, it would not be surprising if it 
transitions into a post-tropical low prior to day 5. The intensity 
forecast is most closely aligned with the FSSE, which is near the 
middle of the intensity guidance envelope.

Mesoscale Discussion 1886
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0338 PM CDT Mon Aug 04 2025

Areas affected...northeast WY...southeast MT...and western SD

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 042038Z - 042215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...A few supercells may develop with a threat of severe
hail/wind downstream of the Big Horn Mountains and along the
western/southern slopes of the Black Hills. While overall
coverage/intensity should be less compared to farther south in the
central High Plains, Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance is possible
in the next couple hours.

DISCUSSION...Initial high-based, low-topped thunderstorms have
formed along the lee of the Big Horn Mountains, with a separate arc
of congested CU along the west to south flank of the Black Hills.
Much of the region between and ahead of these regimes is
characterized by upper 40s to mid 50s surface dew points with large
temperature/dew point spreads. This is yielding more modest buoyancy
relative to eastern CO and southwest NE. Still, moderate deep-layer
shear should support a few high-based supercells across southwest SD
into the northeast WY/far southeast MT vicinity by early evening. A
mix of sporadic severe hail and wind appears possible. Expected
coverage/intensity appears marginally supportive of Severe
Thunderstorm Watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1885
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0335 PM CDT Mon Aug 04 2025

Areas affected...Central Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 042035Z - 042230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered storms are expected to develop through the
afternoon within the higher terrain. These will spread
north/northeast and produce severe winds and isolated large hail. A
watch is possible for parts of central/eastern Montana.

DISCUSSION...Beneath a plume of cirrus overspreading the northern
Rockies, thunderstorms are beginning to initiate and deepen within
southwest into central Montana this afternoon. Additional cumulus
development is also noted along the weak surface trough. Greater
surface heating and moisture farther east has allowed MLCIN to erode
away from the terrain. It may take another 1-2 hours for MLCIN near
the terrain to erode. Over the remainder of the afternoon, scattered
thunderstorms will likely develop and move north and east. Moisture
will have some tendency to mix out where surface heating occurs, but
should support 1000-1500 J/kg MLCAPE. Shear is currently weak within
the region per VAD and 18Z TFX sounding data. However, this should
improve as the compact mid-level jet moves through the northern
Rockies this evening. Some supercell structures along with linear
segments will be possible. The main hazard will be severe wind gusts
given the large temperature-dewpoint spreads. Isolated large hail
may also occur, especially with supercells.

Mesoscale Discussion 1884
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0307 PM CDT Mon Aug 04 2025

Areas affected...the central High Plains

Concerning...Severe potential...Severe Thunderstorm Watch likely 

Valid 042007Z - 042200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated supercells capable of very large hail, severe
gusts, and a brief tornado or two are possible across parts of the
central High Plains. A single or pair of Severe Thunderstorm Watches
will likely be needed.

DISCUSSION...Widely scattered high-based CU/CBs have been noted from
the Laramie Mountains to Pikes Peak, with isolated development along
the South Platte and AR Valleys in eastern CO. Much of this initial
activity is occurring where surface dew point depressions of 35-45 F
are common. This suggests convection may struggle to rapidly
intensify, but should gradually strengthen into early evening.
Farther east, the western extent of low to mid 60s surface dewpoints
exists across far eastern CO, yielding much more ample MLCAPE. Most
guidance suggests at least one storm should become sustained in
southeast CO over the AR Valley and could be a longer-lasting
supercell given the environment. Otherwise, the higher-based
convection to the west and northwest will probably consist of
outflow-dominated supercell structures with a mix of sporadic large
hail and severe gusts.

## Tropical Storm Henriette Forecast Discussion Number 3

Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082025
1100 AM HST Mon Aug 04 2025
 
Conventional satellite imagery shows that the cyclone has become 
better organized, during the past several hours.  A curved band has
developed over the west side of the cyclone, and deep convection is
developing over the surface center.  A 1336 UTC ESA Soil Moisture
Ocean Salinity (SMOS) overpass indicated 34-40 kt winds in the
north quadrant of the cyclone, and a 1746 UTC ASCAT-B pass
revealed 38 kt winds in the same region.  ADT/AiDT and ATMS
sounder objective satellite intensity estimates yield 34 kts, while
the subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB support 35 kt.
Based on these data, the depression has been upgraded to Tropical
Storm Henriette with the initial intensity set at 40 kt.
 
The intensity forecast philosophy is unchanged from the previous one 
with gradual strengthening expected during the next couple of days.  
By mid-period, Henriette should slowly weaken and then level off 
with little change in strength as it traverses cooler oceanic 
surface temperatures and moves into a drier, more stable surrounding 
environment.  The NHC intensity forecast has been lowered a bit to 
agree more with the Decay-SHIPS, the IVCN intensity consensus model, 
and the GFS and ECMWF deterministic models.  
 
The initial motion is estimated to be west-northwestward, or 295/13 
kt.  The global models indicate that a strong mid- to 
upper-tropospheric ridge anchored to the north of the cyclone should 
continue to steer Henriette in this general direction through 96 
hours.  Around day 5, a gradual turn toward the northwest is 
expected in response to a mid-latitude mid-level trough moving 
toward the Hawaiian Islands from the north-central Pacific.

## Tropical Depression Eight-E Forecast Discussion Number 1

date: 2025-08-04, from: Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>193 
WTPZ43 KNHC 040850
TCDEP3
 
Tropical Depression Eight-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082025
1100 PM HST Sun Aug 03 2025
 
Showers and thunderstorms associated with an area of low pressure
well southwest of the Baja California Peninsula have become better
organized during the past 12 hours. Additionally, an overnight ASCAT
pass showed a well-defined circulation with peak winds near 30 kt.
Given the improved convective organization and well-defined
circulation, advisories are being initiated on Tropical Depression
Eight-E. The initial intensity is set at 30 kt, based on a blend of
the ASCAT pass and Dvorak current intensity estimates from both
TAFB and SAB.
 
The initial motion is estimated at 300/13 kt, along the southern
side of a strong subtropical ridge. This ridge is forecast to remain
in place through the 5-day period, steering the system generally
west-northwestward for the entire forecast. A slightly more westward
motion is possible by day 4 as the cyclone becomes more shallow and
is steered within the low- to mid-level flow. The updated track
forecast is close to the consensus aids.
 
The system is forecast to steadily strengthen during the next couple 
of days as it moves over warm waters and through a moist, low-shear 
environment. It is expected to become a tropical storm on Monday 
and could approach hurricane strength between 36 and 60 hours. After 
that time, a gradual weakening trend is anticipated as the cyclone 
moves over sea surface temperatures below 26 degrees C and begins to 
entrain drier mid-level air within a more stable environment. 
Simulated satellite imagery from the global models supports this 
scenario, showing a reduction in deep convection as the system 
continues west-northwestward into the central Pacific basin. The 
forecast is slightly above the intensity guidance through 60 hours, 
then is in good agreement with the consensus aids thereafter.

0349 PM CDT Sun Aug 03 2025

Areas affected...western KS

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 032049Z - 032245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms will track
south/southeast across western Kansas through early evening. Large
hail and strong gusts are possible with the strongest storms.

DISCUSSION...Isolated thunderstorms have developed this afternoon
along the strong moisture gradient across northwest KS. Steep
midlevel lapse rates near 8 C/km are aiding in moderate to strong
destabilization with MLCAPE values near 2000-2500 J/kg. While
vertical shear is somewhat modest across northwest KS, these storms
will encounter stronger effective shear magnitudes greater than 30
kt as they track south. These storms will also move into the more
moist boundary layer. As a result, additional convection or
intensification is possible with time and southward extent. The
favorable thermodynamic and kinematic environment will support
isolated large hail. Additionally, some guidance suggests clustering
could occur toward evening. If this scenario occurs, damaging wind
potential could increase as well.  Trends will be monitored for
possible watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1878
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0336 PM CDT Sun Aug 03 2025

Areas affected...portions of northeast NM into the OK/TX Panhandles

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 032036Z - 032230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated thunderstorms will develop southeast from
northeast New Mexico into the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles the next
few hours. A few instances of large hail and strong/severe gusts are
possible.

DISCUSSION...Isolated thunderstorms are developing this afternoon
within low-level convergence/upslope. Strong heating has allowed
temperatures to climb into the low to mid 80s F behind morning
convection and outflow. South/southeasterly low-level winds have
maintained mid-60s F dewpoints beneath steep midlevel lapse rates.
This is fostering moderate destabilization, with 1000-2000 J/kg
MLCAPE noted in 20z mesoanalysis. Vertically veering winds profiles,
with increasing northwesterly flow aloft is contributing to fairly
robust shear, with effective shear magnitudes greater than 40 kts
apparent in regional VWP and mesoanalysis data. This environment
will support organized cells capable of producing large hail and
strong/severe gusts. Convective coverage remains uncertain, but
could increase with southward extent toward evening. This area is
being monitored for possible severe thunderstorm watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1877
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0244 PM CDT Sun Aug 03 2025

Areas affected...Southwestern into parts of eastern Oregon

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 031944Z - 032145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered afternoon thunderstorms will be capable of
strong to severe wind gusts and mainly small hail. A watch is not
expected this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Cumulus towers continue to deepen along and east of the
Cascades in southwest Oregon. This is in response to an approaching
shortwave trough. While these thunderstorms have been slow to move
off of the terrain thus far, continued heating in southern/eastern
Oregon will likely erode remaining MLCIN within the next 1-2 hours.
Additional storm development is likely through the afternoon as
well. With elevated convection associated with a small-scale
perturbation moving through northeast Oregon, development within the
Blue Mountains is less certain. However, additional heating during
the afternoon may still be sufficient for this to occur. Steep low
and mid-level lapse rates and 20-25 kts of shear (which will
marginally improve to near 30 kts with time) will result in
marginally organized storms capable of severe wind gusts.
Thermodynamic profiles will be conducive to mainly small hail, but
isolated hail near 1 inch could occur in the most intense storms.

## Post-Tropical Cyclone Gil Forecast Discussion Number 14

Post-Tropical Cyclone Gil Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072025
500 AM HST Sun Aug 03 2025
 
Cool waters combined with a drier and more stable environment have 
taken their toll on Gil. The system has been devoid of deep 
convection overnight, with only an exposed swirl of low- to 
mid-level clouds remaining. The initial intensity is lowered to 45 
kt, based on a blend of the latest subjective Dvorak estimates from 
TAFB and SAB and objective estimates from UW-CIMSS. Given the cool 
waters, dry and stable air, and strengthening west-southwesterly 
shear, no new organized convection is expected. Therefore, this will 
be the final advisory on the system as it has become post-tropical. 
Gil is expected to dissipate around midweek as it opens into a 
trough northeast of the Hawaiian Islands.

The initial motion is estimated at 285/16 kt. The system is being 
steered by a low- to mid-level ridge to its north, and this general 
motion is expected to continue into tonight. A gradual decrease in 
forward speed is anticipated by Monday, followed by a turn toward 
the west as the shallow remnant low becomes steered by the low-level 
flow. The updated track forecast remains close to the previous 
advisory and continues to follow the tightly clustered guidance 
envelope.
 
For additional information on the post-tropical low please see High
Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS
header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFEPI.php

## Tropical Storm Gil Forecast Discussion Number 13

<pre>863 
WTPZ42 KNHC 030832
TCDEP2
 
Tropical Storm Gil Discussion Number  13
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072025
1100 PM HST Sat Aug 02 2025
 
Satellite imagery shows the convection north of the low-level 
circulation quickly diminishing as Gil continues west-northwestward 
over progressively cooler waters and into a more stable environment. 
A timely ASCAT pass revealed peak winds of around 45 kt in the 
northern semicircle. Subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates 
from TAFB and SAB range from 3.0/45 kt to 3.5/55 kt, which are 
slightly higher than objective satellite estimates. Based on a blend 
of these data and the ASCAT pass, the initial intensity is set at 50 
kt.
 
The initial motion is estimated at 290/16 kt. Gil is being steered
by a mid-level ridge to its north, and this general motion is
expected to continue Sunday. A gradual decrease in forward
speed is anticipated by Monday, followed by a turn toward the west
as the shallow remnant low becomes steered by the low-level flow. 
The updated track forecast remains close to the previous advisory 
and continues to follow the tightly clustered guidance envelope.
 
Continued movement over progressively cooler waters, intrusion of 
dry mid-level air, and the onset of increasing west-southwesterly 
shear should accelerate Gil’s weakening trend. Simulated satellite 
imagery from global models continues to suggest that Gil will lose 
its deep convection and become post-tropical late Sunday, or in 
about 24 hours. The system is then forecast to gradually spin down 
and dissipate within a few days, likely by day 4, as it opens into 
a trough northeast of the Hawaiian Islands.

Day 2 Convective Outlook CORR 1
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0304 AM CDT Sun Aug 03 2025

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN ROCKIES INTO THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN PLAINS...

CORRECTED FOR FLIPPED LINE IN NORTHEAST

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms with severe gusts and hail will be possible
on Monday from parts of the northern Rockies into the Dakotas and
central High Plains.

...Northern Rockies/Northern High Plains...
A mid-level shortwave trough will move northeastward across the
Pacific Northwest on Monday. At the surface, a cold front will
advance eastward into the northern Rockies, as upslope easterly flow
remains over the northern High Plains. As surface temperatures warm,
thunderstorm development is expected during the afternoon near the
front, and in the higher terrain of the northern Rockies. These
storms will likely increase in coverage by early evening, moving
eastward into the northern High Plains. Surface dewpoints across
much central and eastern Montana are forecast to be in the upper 40s
and lower 50s F, which will contribute to the development of weak
instability by afternoon. Near the forecast pocket of instability,
forecast soundings suggest that 0-6 km shear will be in the 30 to 40
knot range. This, combined with steep low to mid-level lapse rates
near 8 C/km, will likely support an localized severe threat. The
stronger rotating cells could produce hail. Isolated severe gusts
will also be possible, mainly with short line segments that have
some organization.

...Central and Northern Plains...
A mid-level ridge will remain over the central Rockies on Monday, as
a trough remains nearly stationary across northern Minnesota. At the
surface, a north-to-south corridor of low-level moisture with
dewpoints in the 60s F, will be in place from central Kansas
northward into the eastern Dakotas. Moderate instability is forecast
to develop along the western edge of this moist airmass, from
western Nebraska into southwestern and central South Dakota. As
destabilization takes place during the day, isolated thunderstorm
development will be possible, mainly in areas where low-level
convergence becomes maximized. Across much of the region, 0-6 km
shear is forecast to be in the 35 to 45 knot range. This will
support an isolated threat for severe gusts. Hail will also be
possible in the central High Plains, where mid-level lapse rates are
forecast to be steep.
