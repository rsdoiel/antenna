Mesoscale Discussion 1886
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0338 PM CDT Mon Aug 04 2025

Areas affected...northeast WY...southeast MT...and western SD

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 042038Z - 042215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...A few supercells may develop with a threat of severe
hail/wind downstream of the Big Horn Mountains and along the
western/southern slopes of the Black Hills. While overall
coverage/intensity should be less compared to farther south in the
central High Plains, Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance is possible
in the next couple hours.

DISCUSSION...Initial high-based, low-topped thunderstorms have
formed along the lee of the Big Horn Mountains, with a separate arc
of congested CU along the west to south flank of the Black Hills.
Much of the region between and ahead of these regimes is
characterized by upper 40s to mid 50s surface dew points with large
temperature/dew point spreads. This is yielding more modest buoyancy
relative to eastern CO and southwest NE. Still, moderate deep-layer
shear should support a few high-based supercells across southwest SD
into the northeast WY/far southeast MT vicinity by early evening. A
mix of sporadic severe hail and wind appears possible. Expected
coverage/intensity appears marginally supportive of Severe
Thunderstorm Watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1885
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0335 PM CDT Mon Aug 04 2025

Areas affected...Central Montana

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 042035Z - 042230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered storms are expected to develop through the
afternoon within the higher terrain. These will spread
north/northeast and produce severe winds and isolated large hail. A
watch is possible for parts of central/eastern Montana.

DISCUSSION...Beneath a plume of cirrus overspreading the northern
Rockies, thunderstorms are beginning to initiate and deepen within
southwest into central Montana this afternoon. Additional cumulus
development is also noted along the weak surface trough. Greater
surface heating and moisture farther east has allowed MLCIN to erode
away from the terrain. It may take another 1-2 hours for MLCIN near
the terrain to erode. Over the remainder of the afternoon, scattered
thunderstorms will likely develop and move north and east. Moisture
will have some tendency to mix out where surface heating occurs, but
should support 1000-1500 J/kg MLCAPE. Shear is currently weak within
the region per VAD and 18Z TFX sounding data. However, this should
improve as the compact mid-level jet moves through the northern
Rockies this evening. Some supercell structures along with linear
segments will be possible. The main hazard will be severe wind gusts
given the large temperature-dewpoint spreads. Isolated large hail
may also occur, especially with supercells.

## SPC MD 1884

Mesoscale Discussion 1884
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0307 PM CDT Mon Aug 04 2025

Areas affected...the central High Plains

Concerning...Severe potential...Severe Thunderstorm Watch likely 

Valid 042007Z - 042200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated supercells capable of very large hail, severe
gusts, and a brief tornado or two are possible across parts of the
central High Plains. A single or pair of Severe Thunderstorm Watches
will likely be needed.

DISCUSSION...Widely scattered high-based CU/CBs have been noted from
the Laramie Mountains to Pikes Peak, with isolated development along
the South Platte and AR Valleys in eastern CO. Much of this initial
activity is occurring where surface dew point depressions of 35-45 F
are common. This suggests convection may struggle to rapidly
intensify, but should gradually strengthen into early evening.
Farther east, the western extent of low to mid 60s surface dewpoints
exists across far eastern CO, yielding much more ample MLCAPE. Most
guidance suggests at least one storm should become sustained in
southeast CO over the AR Valley and could be a longer-lasting
supercell given the environment. Otherwise, the higher-based
convection to the west and northwest will probably consist of
outflow-dominated supercell structures with a mix of sporadic large
hail and severe gusts.

## Tropical Storm Henriette Forecast Discussion Number 3

date: 2025-08-04, from: Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>027 
WTPZ43 KNHC 042034
TCDEP3
 
Tropical Storm Henriette Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082025
1100 AM HST Mon Aug 04 2025
 
Conventional satellite imagery shows that the cyclone has become 
better organized, during the past several hours.  A curved band has
developed over the west side of the cyclone, and deep convection is
developing over the surface center.  A 1336 UTC ESA Soil Moisture
Ocean Salinity (SMOS) overpass indicated 34-40 kt winds in the
north quadrant of the cyclone, and a 1746 UTC ASCAT-B pass
revealed 38 kt winds in the same region.  ADT/AiDT and ATMS
sounder objective satellite intensity estimates yield 34 kts, while
the subjective Dvorak estimates from TAFB and SAB support 35 kt.
Based on these data, the depression has been upgraded to Tropical
Storm Henriette with the initial intensity set at 40 kt.
 
The intensity forecast philosophy is unchanged from the previous one 
with gradual strengthening expected during the next couple of days.  
By mid-period, Henriette should slowly weaken and then level off 
with little change in strength as it traverses cooler oceanic 
surface temperatures and moves into a drier, more stable surrounding 
environment.  The NHC intensity forecast has been lowered a bit to 
agree more with the Decay-SHIPS, the IVCN intensity consensus model, 
and the GFS and ECMWF deterministic models.  
 
The initial motion is estimated to be west-northwestward, or 295/13 
kt.  The global models indicate that a strong mid- to 
upper-tropospheric ridge anchored to the north of the cyclone should 
continue to steer Henriette in this general direction through 96 
hours.  Around day 5, a gradual turn toward the northwest is 
expected in response to a mid-latitude mid-level trough moving 
toward the Hawaiian Islands from the north-central Pacific.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0256 PM CDT Mon Aug 04 2025

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN/CENTRAL UTAH AND FAR
NORTHERN ARIZONA...

An area delineating potential for isolated dry thunderstorms has
been added for portions of northeast Arizona and northwest New
Mexico. 12z CAM guidance suggests at least some potential for
isolated thunderstorms across this region. The highlighted area has
been confined to areas where fuels appear at least marginally
receptive to dry lightning ignitions.

Minor expansions were made along the eastern periphery of the
elevated area into portions of eastern Wyoming and north-central
Colorado. Elsewhere, the previous forecast appears to be on track.
See the discussion below for more details.

..Karstens.. 08/04/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0156 AM CDT Mon Aug 04 2025/

...Synopsis...
Broad midlevel troughing will persist across the
Northwest/Intermountain West, while an expansive midlevel
anticyclone builds over the Southwest and southern/central Rockies. 

...Great Basin into the central/northern Rockies...
Between the expansive midlevel anticyclone and broad midlevel
troughing, a belt of enhanced deep-layer west-southwesterly flow
will persist across the Great Basin into the northern/central
Rockies. Diurnal heating amid a dry antecedent air mass will yield 
a deeply mixed boundary layer (single-digit to lower teens RH).
These dry conditions combined with 15-20 mph sustained
west-southwesterly surface winds will lead to widespread elevated
fire-weather conditions, with critical conditions expected over
southern/central UT into northern AZ (where the overlap of strong
winds and low RH atop receptive fuels will be maximized).

0252 PM CDT Mon Aug 04 2025

Valid 042000Z - 051200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF
THE HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms with severe gusts and large to very large hail will be
possible this afternoon through this evening from parts of the
northern Rockies into the Dakotas and central/southern High Plains.

...20z Update...
No changes are needed to the current D1 Convective Outlook. See
previous discussion below for more information.

..Thornton.. 08/04/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1136 AM CDT Mon Aug 04 2025/

...Central High Plains...
An upper ridge extending from NM north-northeastward into the
central High Plains will feature a couple of weak disturbances
cresting the ridge through early Tuesday morning.  The most notable
disturbance over northeast UT late this morning is forecast to move
east across southern WY by early evening and potentially play a role
in storm development late this afternoon/evening.  A seasonably
moist airmass featuring 55-60 deg F dewpoints into eastern WY/NE
Panhandle will undergo strong heating.  Low-level southeasterly flow
will veer to northwesterly in the mid levels, resulting in moderate
to strong deep-layer vertical shear and an overall wind profile that
favors supercells. As such, there is conditional risk for severe
thunderstorms. However, the forcing mechanism for convective
initiation is fairly weak.  The general expectation is that
low-level convergence and upslope flow across the Black Hills
vicinity should be enough for scattered convective initiation with
other widely scattered storms possible farther south. 

The environment supports supercells capable of large to very large
hail and severe gusts. Any supercells that develop could last for a
few hours, but should eventually trend towards a more linear mode
with one or more clusters evolving across western/central NE and
northeast CO this evening. Aided by a 40+ kt low-level jet,
continued upscale growth should support these clusters of strong to
severe storms into the overnight hours where damaging winds will be
possible.

...Northern Rockies into eastern Montana...
Water-vapor imagery shows a potent mid- to upper-level shortwave
trough moving east across OR this morning.  This disturbance is
forecast to move into the northern Rockies by early evening and into
the northern High Plains by daybreak.  Strong large-scale ascent
associated with this shortwave trough as it acquires a negative
tilt, will favor isolated to scattered storms from the Snake Valley
northward into north-central ID and into western/southwest MT. 
Initially cellular storms will pose an isolated risk for severe wind
gusts.  As storms move into the high plains, slightly greater
low-level moisture will aid in more numerous storms developing and
their attendant outflow.  Scattered severe gusts (60-75 mph) are
possible with this activity as it moves east-northeast across MT.

...Southern High Plains...
Strong heating along a lee trough could support isolated to widely
scattered thunderstorm development from the Raton Mesa into
southeast CO/northeast NM.  Ample high-level flow atop strongly
veering low-level winds, coupled with a very unstable airmass on the
western periphery of rich moisture, will favor the possibility for a
few supercells by late afternoon.  Large to very large hail, severe
gusts, and a brief tornado are the potential hazards.  Some guidance
shows a cluster evolving during the evening with severe gusts
becoming the primary hazard.

...Central/Southeast Texas...
A weakening squall line will continue southward to the middle TX
coast over the next couple of hours with other weak thunderstorm
activity perhaps lingering atop the cold pool.  Isolated strong
gusts will probably become increasingly localized during the midday.

FROM THE EASTERN DAKOTAS AND MINNESOTA SOUTHWARD INTO PARTS OF IOWA
AND NEBRASKA...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms associated with severe gusts and hail will be
possible across parts of the north-central U.S. on Wednesday.

...Northern Plains/Upper Midwest...
Thunderstorms are expected to be ongoing Wednesday morning across
parts of MN/IA.  These storms may be strong with gusty winds and
hail through the morning before weakening.  In the wake of morning
activity, strong destabilization will occur across the eastern
Dakotas, western MN, and central NE.  However, large-scale upper
ridging and height rises will also be occurring in this region, with
limited forcing mechanisms for afternoon re-development of storms. 
Given the inherent uncertainties at this time range, and the
favorable conditional environment, will maintain MRGL risk for now
and re-evaluate in later updates.

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms associated with a threat for severe gusts and isolated
large hail will be possible across parts of the Dakotas on Tuesday.

...Dakotas...
A prominent shortwave trough now over northern CA/southern OR will
track northeastward and top the upper ridge on Tuesday.  An
associated cold front will sag southeastward across MT and into
western ND by afternoon, promoting the development of scattered
thunderstorms.  Models are in general agreement that rapid
destabilization will occur in the wake of morning clouds/precip,
with MLCAPE values of 2500+ J/kg across a broad region of the
Dakotas and northern NE.  The storms that form along the front will
likely become supercellular with a risk of large hail and perhaps a
tornado or two.  Activity is expected to organize upscale by early
evening, tracking across the Dakotas and northern NE with a
continued risk of damaging winds and hail.

1138 AM CDT Mon Aug 04 2025

Valid 041700Z - 051200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE GREAT BASIN INTO THE
CENTRAL ROCKIES...

A minor expansion of the area delineating potential for isolated dry
thunderstorms was made into parts of far northern Nevada and central
Oregon. Some potential for scattered dry thunderstorms exists within
this region, though confined to areas where fuels appear more
marginally receptive to dry lightning ignitions.

The balance of the previous forecast generally remains on track.
Breezy northwest winds across portions of northwest California may
result in brief/localized elevated conditions. Otherwise, see the
discussion below for more details.

..Karstens.. 08/04/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0156 AM CDT Mon Aug 04 2025/

...Synopsis...
Along the northwestern periphery of a large-scale ridge extending
from the Southwest into the northern Plains, a compact/robust
midlevel trough will advance east-northeastward from the Northwest
into the northern Rockies during the day. 

...Great Basin into the central Rockies...
Between the large-scale ridge and midlevel trough, a belt of
moderate deep-layer west-southwesterly flow will overspread the
Great Basin into the central Rockies through the afternoon. Here,
deep boundary-layer mixing into the enhanced flow aloft will favor
widespread single-digit RH and 15-25 mph sustained
west-southwesterly surface winds. These dry/windy conditions will
lead to critical fire-weather conditions across much of UT and
adjacent states, given very receptive fuels. 

...Dry Thunderstorms - Intermountain West/Northern Rockies...
Strong/focused forcing for ascent accompanying the midlevel trough
will aid in thunderstorm development across much of the
Intermountain West and northern Rockies throughout the day. Along
the southern periphery of deeper midlevel moisture across parts of
the Northwest into the northern Rockies, isolated high-based
thunderstorms are expected in an air mass characterized by 0.60-0.75
inch PW and inverted-V soundings. This will promote mostly dry
thunderstorms with a risk of lightning-induced ignitions and
strong-severe outflow winds. Reference the SPC Day 1 Convective
Outlook for information on the severe risk.

Day 1 Convective Outlook

Valid 041630Z - 051200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF
THE HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms with severe gusts and large to very large hail will be
possible this afternoon through this evening from parts of the
northern Rockies into the Dakotas and central/southern High Plains.

...Central High Plains...
An upper ridge extending from NM north-northeastward into the
central High Plains will feature a couple of weak disturbances
cresting the ridge through early Tuesday morning.  The most notable
disturbance over northeast UT late this morning is forecast to move
east across southern WY by early evening and potentially play a role
in storm development late this afternoon/evening.  A seasonably
moist airmass featuring 55-60 deg F dewpoints into eastern WY/NE
Panhandle will undergo strong heating.  Low-level southeasterly flow
will veer to northwesterly in the mid levels, resulting in moderate
to strong deep-layer vertical shear and an overall wind profile that
favors supercells. As such, there is conditional risk for severe
thunderstorms. However, the forcing mechanism for convective
initiation is fairly weak.  The general expectation is that
low-level convergence and upslope flow across the Black Hills
vicinity should be enough for scattered convective initiation with
other widely scattered storms possible farther south. 

The environment supports supercells capable of large to very large
hail and severe gusts. Any supercells that develop could last for a
few hours, but should eventually trend towards a more linear mode
with one or more clusters evolving across western/central NE and
northeast CO this evening. Aided by a 40+ kt low-level jet,
continued upscale growth should support these clusters of strong to
severe storms into the overnight hours where damaging winds will be
possible.

...Northern Rockies into eastern Montana...
Water-vapor imagery shows a potent mid- to upper-level shortwave
trough moving east across OR this morning.  This disturbance is
forecast to move into the northern Rockies by early evening and into
the northern High Plains by daybreak.  Strong large-scale ascent
associated with this shortwave trough as it acquires a negative
tilt, will favor isolated to scattered storms from the Snake Valley
northward into north-central ID and into western/southwest MT. 
Initially cellular storms will pose an isolated risk for severe wind
gusts.  As storms move into the high plains, slightly greater
low-level moisture will aid in more numerous storms developing and
their attendant outflow.  Scattered severe gusts (60-75 mph) are
possible with this activity as it moves east-northeast across MT.

...Southern High Plains...
Strong heating along a lee trough could support isolated to widely
scattered thunderstorm development from the Raton Mesa into
southeast CO/northeast NM.  Ample high-level flow atop strongly
veering low-level winds, coupled with a very unstable airmass on the
western periphery of rich moisture, will favor the possibility for a
few supercells by late afternoon.  Large to very large hail, severe
gusts, and a brief tornado are the potential hazards.  Some guidance
shows a cluster evolving during the evening with severe gusts
becoming the primary hazard.

...Central/Southeast Texas...
A weakening squall line will continue southward to the middle TX
coast over the next couple of hours with other weak thunderstorm
activity perhaps lingering atop the cold pool.  Isolated strong
gusts will probably become increasingly localized during the midday.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook

0403 AM CDT Mon Aug 04 2025

Valid 071200Z - 121200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Thursday/Day 4 to Saturday/Day 6...
During the late week time-frame, a mid-level trough is forecast to
develop over the Pacific Northwest and move eastward into the
northern Plains. As the system approaches, a moist and unstable
airmass is forecast across the northern Plains and upper Mississippi
Valley. On Thursday, a lead shortwave trough is forecast to move
across the northern Plains. Large-scale ascent associated with the
trough could result in a cluster of storms with an isolated severe
threat from Thursday evening into the overnight period. Isolated to
scattered thunderstorms may again develop Friday afternoon and
evening, as the exit region of a mid-level jet moves across the
northern Plains. As instability becomes maximized on Friday
afternoon, a severe threat will be possible across parts of the
Dakotas and Minnesota. Large hail and severe gusts will be the
primary threats. The models are in reasonably good agreement on the
timing of the mid-level system. For this reason, have added a 15
percent into the northern Plains to coincide with the projected
locations of the instability axis and mid-level jet.

On Saturday, the mid-level trough is forecast to move into the
northern Plains, as a belt of southwesterly flow shifts eastward
across the Upper Midwest. Thunderstorm development will be possible
in the afternoon and evening, to the east of a front within an
unstable airmass in the upper Mississippi Valley. Moderate
deep-layer shear will again support an isolated severe threat across
the region.

...Sunday/Day 7 and Monday/Day 8...
The front is forecast to move southeastward into the upper
Mississippi Valley on Sunday. This will favor thunderstorm
development along a corridor from Iowa northeastward into Wisconsin,
where an isolated severe threat will be possible in the afternoon
and evening. On Monday, forecasts suggest the instability axis will
remain in a similar location. For this reason, a severe threat could
again affect this same corridor. Due to the extended range in the
forecast, there is some uncertainty concerning this scenario early
next week.

## Tropical Depression Eight-E Forecast Discussion Number 1

date: 2025-08-04, from: Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>193 
WTPZ43 KNHC 040850
TCDEP3
 
Tropical Depression Eight-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP082025
1100 PM HST Sun Aug 03 2025
 
Showers and thunderstorms associated with an area of low pressure
well southwest of the Baja California Peninsula have become better
organized during the past 12 hours. Additionally, an overnight ASCAT
pass showed a well-defined circulation with peak winds near 30 kt.
Given the improved convective organization and well-defined
circulation, advisories are being initiated on Tropical Depression
Eight-E. The initial intensity is set at 30 kt, based on a blend of
the ASCAT pass and Dvorak current intensity estimates from both
TAFB and SAB.
 
The initial motion is estimated at 300/13 kt, along the southern
side of a strong subtropical ridge. This ridge is forecast to remain
in place through the 5-day period, steering the system generally
west-northwestward for the entire forecast. A slightly more westward
motion is possible by day 4 as the cyclone becomes more shallow and
is steered within the low- to mid-level flow. The updated track
forecast is close to the consensus aids.
 
The system is forecast to steadily strengthen during the next couple 
of days as it moves over warm waters and through a moist, low-shear 
environment. It is expected to become a tropical storm on Monday 
and could approach hurricane strength between 36 and 60 hours. After 
that time, a gradual weakening trend is anticipated as the cyclone 
moves over sea surface temperatures below 26 degrees C and begins to 
entrain drier mid-level air within a more stable environment. 
Simulated satellite imagery from the global models supports this 
scenario, showing a reduction in deep convection as the system 
continues west-northwestward into the central Pacific basin. The 
forecast is slightly above the intensity guidance through 60 hours, 
then is in good agreement with the consensus aids thereafter.

Areas affected...western KS

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 032049Z - 032245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms will track
south/southeast across western Kansas through early evening. Large
hail and strong gusts are possible with the strongest storms.

DISCUSSION...Isolated thunderstorms have developed this afternoon
along the strong moisture gradient across northwest KS. Steep
midlevel lapse rates near 8 C/km are aiding in moderate to strong
destabilization with MLCAPE values near 2000-2500 J/kg. While
vertical shear is somewhat modest across northwest KS, these storms
will encounter stronger effective shear magnitudes greater than 30
kt as they track south. These storms will also move into the more
moist boundary layer. As a result, additional convection or
intensification is possible with time and southward extent. The
favorable thermodynamic and kinematic environment will support
isolated large hail. Additionally, some guidance suggests clustering
could occur toward evening. If this scenario occurs, damaging wind
potential could increase as well.  Trends will be monitored for
possible watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1878
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0336 PM CDT Sun Aug 03 2025

Areas affected...portions of northeast NM into the OK/TX Panhandles

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 032036Z - 032230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated thunderstorms will develop southeast from
northeast New Mexico into the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles the next
few hours. A few instances of large hail and strong/severe gusts are
possible.

DISCUSSION...Isolated thunderstorms are developing this afternoon
within low-level convergence/upslope. Strong heating has allowed
temperatures to climb into the low to mid 80s F behind morning
convection and outflow. South/southeasterly low-level winds have
maintained mid-60s F dewpoints beneath steep midlevel lapse rates.
This is fostering moderate destabilization, with 1000-2000 J/kg
MLCAPE noted in 20z mesoanalysis. Vertically veering winds profiles,
with increasing northwesterly flow aloft is contributing to fairly
robust shear, with effective shear magnitudes greater than 40 kts
apparent in regional VWP and mesoanalysis data. This environment
will support organized cells capable of producing large hail and
strong/severe gusts. Convective coverage remains uncertain, but
could increase with southward extent toward evening. This area is
being monitored for possible severe thunderstorm watch issuance.

Mesoscale Discussion 1877
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0244 PM CDT Sun Aug 03 2025

Areas affected...Southwestern into parts of eastern Oregon

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 031944Z - 032145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered afternoon thunderstorms will be capable of
strong to severe wind gusts and mainly small hail. A watch is not
expected this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Cumulus towers continue to deepen along and east of the
Cascades in southwest Oregon. This is in response to an approaching
shortwave trough. While these thunderstorms have been slow to move
off of the terrain thus far, continued heating in southern/eastern
Oregon will likely erode remaining MLCIN within the next 1-2 hours.
Additional storm development is likely through the afternoon as
well. With elevated convection associated with a small-scale
perturbation moving through northeast Oregon, development within the
Blue Mountains is less certain. However, additional heating during
the afternoon may still be sufficient for this to occur. Steep low
and mid-level lapse rates and 20-25 kts of shear (which will
marginally improve to near 30 kts with time) will result in
marginally organized storms capable of severe wind gusts.
Thermodynamic profiles will be conducive to mainly small hail, but
isolated hail near 1 inch could occur in the most intense storms.

## SPC Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0340 PM CDT Sun Aug 03 2025

Valid 051200Z - 111200Z

A persistent mid/upper-level trough is forecast to remain across the
Northwest U.S. Day 3/Tuesday into Day 7/Saturday. Meanwhile, a
mid/upper-level ridge centered over the Desert Southwest Day
3/Sunday is forecast to slowly build northwestward into the southern
Great Basin through at least Day 6/Friday while remaining
quasistationary over the Desert Southwest. 

...Great Basin/Southwest/Rocky Mountains: Day 3/Tuesday - Day
6/Friday...
Multiple days of hot, dry and windy conditions are expected across
the Great Basin, northern Arizona, and western portions of the Rocky
Mountains Day 3/Tuesday through Day 6/Friday. At this time, critical
fire weather conditions appear most likely across portions of
central/southern Utah, far northern Arizona, and far eastern Nevada
Day 3/Tuesday and Day 4/Wednesday as mid/upper-level winds increase
over the area sandwiched between the base of the trough and along
the northern periphery of the ridge. Fuels across this region remain
extremely receptive to fire spread owing to lack of recent
appreciable rainfall and subsequent ongoing moderate/severe drought
conditions.

Thereafter, guidance begins to diverge a bit regarding the evolution
of the upper-level trough/ridge pattern. Nevertheless, persistent
enhanced deep-layer flow atop receptive fuels coupled with dry to
very dry low-levels suggest continued chances for near Critical
conditions Day 5/Thursday and Day 6/Friday. Enhanced fire weather
conditions are forecast to finally diminish Day 7/Saturday as the
trough/ridge shift away from the area.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Thunderstorms are possible across portions of Arizona into far
southern Utah beginning Day 4/Wednesday through much of the work
week. Dry thunderstorms are possible across northern Arizona and
southern Utah, where fuels remain receptive to fire spread due to
the ongoing severe/extreme drought conditions. However, increasing
PWATs and uncertainties regarding coverage/location of any
thunderstorms precludes introducing probabilities for dry
thunderstorms at this time.

## Post-Tropical Cyclone Gil Forecast Discussion Number 14

Post-Tropical Cyclone Gil Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP072025
500 AM HST Sun Aug 03 2025
 
Cool waters combined with a drier and more stable environment have 
taken their toll on Gil. The system has been devoid of deep 
convection overnight, with only an exposed swirl of low- to 
mid-level clouds remaining. The initial intensity is lowered to 45 
kt, based on a blend of the latest subjective Dvorak estimates from 
TAFB and SAB and objective estimates from UW-CIMSS. Given the cool 
waters, dry and stable air, and strengthening west-southwesterly 
shear, no new organized convection is expected. Therefore, this will 
be the final advisory on the system as it has become post-tropical. 
Gil is expected to dissipate around midweek as it opens into a 
trough northeast of the Hawaiian Islands.

The initial motion is estimated at 285/16 kt. The system is being 
steered by a low- to mid-level ridge to its north, and this general 
motion is expected to continue into tonight. A gradual decrease in 
forward speed is anticipated by Monday, followed by a turn toward 
the west as the shallow remnant low becomes steered by the low-level 
flow. The updated track forecast remains close to the previous 
advisory and continues to follow the tightly clustered guidance 
envelope.
 
For additional information on the post-tropical low please see High
Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS
header NFDHSFEPI, WMO header FZPN02 KWBC, and on the web at

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.html"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.gif" border="1" alt="Day 1 Outlook Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="815" height="555" align="center" /></a><pre>
Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0749 AM CDT Sun Aug 03 2025

Valid 031300Z - 041200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF
THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Large to very large hail and damaging winds will be possible this
afternoon and evening over parts of the central/southern High
Plains. Additional strong to severe storms are probable in the
Northwest during the afternoon.

...Southern Plains...
A decaying MCS is currently moving through the eastern TX Panhandle
and western OK. Expectation is for this system to continue
south-southeastward for the next several hours while gradually
weakening. Cool outflow and cloud cover associated with this system
will have an impact on the severe potential across the region today,
leading to above-average uncertainty regarding the overall
convective evolution. 

The overall environment from the TX Panhandle southward through the
South Plains and eastward into western OK and northwest TX will be
characterized by moderate northwesterly flow aloft, steep mid-level
lapse rates, and afternoon surface dewpoints ranging from the upper
50s to upper 60s. These conditions will support moderate to strong
buoyancy across much of the region, but areas under the influence of
the MCS's outflow and/or cloud cover will likely remain capped due
to limited/filtered diurnal heating. Current expectation is for the
TX South Plains and Permian Basin to remain south of the outflow,
allowing for strong heating and airmass destabilization. The outflow
is expected to act as the primary impetus for convective initiation
across the region this afternoon. Additional areas of low-level
convergence near a weak surface low over southeast NM and the weak
lee troughing extending from southeast CO across eastern NM could
result in a few storms as well. 

Low-level easterly/southeasterly flow veering to northwesterly in
the mid levels will result in moderate vertical shear, with the
overall wind profile quite supportive for large hail. As such, there
is a conditional risk for supercells capable of large to very large
hail. With time, some upscale growth into one or more linear
clusters with an increased risk for damaging gusts is possible.

...Central High Plains...
Early morning surface analysis placed a broad area of low pressure
from northeast CO into southwest SD. A low is expected develop
within this region by the early afternoon, and low-level convergence
in the vicinity of this low will likely result in thunderstorm
initiation. Late afternoon initiation is possible along the weak lee
trough across eastern WY as well. Moderate buoyancy will support
strong updrafts, but vertical shear is forecast to be weak, limiting
storm organization and longevity. Isolated hail and damaging gusts
are possible, particularly with any forward-propagating clusters
that can develop.

...Northwest...
Shortwave trough currently off the northern CA coast is forecast to
continue northeastward today, with lift associated with this system
impinging on the region by the early afternoon. Increasing mid-level
moisture (already apparent on the 12Z BOI sounding) will help
support moderate buoyancy and the development of scattered to
numerous thunderstorm this afternoon and evening. A belt of stronger
mid-level flow ahead of the shortwave will increase deep-layer shear
to 30-40 kt, supporting some storm organization. Steep lapse rates
with inverted-v thermodynamic profiles and the potential for
high-based semi-organized clusters will favor strong downdrafts
capable of occasional severe gusts with the stronger storms. Small
hail will also be possible with any more persistent clusters or weak
supercell structures despite the limited buoyancy.

## Tropical Storm Gil Forecast Discussion Number 13

Tropical Storm Gil Discussion Number  13

1100 PM HST Sat Aug 02 2025
 
Satellite imagery shows the convection north of the low-level 
circulation quickly diminishing as Gil continues west-northwestward 
over progressively cooler waters and into a more stable environment. 
A timely ASCAT pass revealed peak winds of around 45 kt in the 
northern semicircle. Subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates 
from TAFB and SAB range from 3.0/45 kt to 3.5/55 kt, which are 
slightly higher than objective satellite estimates. Based on a blend 
of these data and the ASCAT pass, the initial intensity is set at 50 
kt.
 
The initial motion is estimated at 290/16 kt. Gil is being steered
by a mid-level ridge to its north, and this general motion is
expected to continue Sunday. A gradual decrease in forward
speed is anticipated by Monday, followed by a turn toward the west
as the shallow remnant low becomes steered by the low-level flow. 
The updated track forecast remains close to the previous advisory 
and continues to follow the tightly clustered guidance envelope.
 
Continued movement over progressively cooler waters, intrusion of 
dry mid-level air, and the onset of increasing west-southwesterly 
shear should accelerate Gil’s weakening trend. Simulated satellite 
imagery from global models continues to suggest that Gil will lose 
its deep convection and become post-tropical late Sunday, or in 
about 24 hours. The system is then forecast to gradually spin down 
and dissipate within a few days, likely by day 4, as it opens into 
a trough northeast of the Hawaiian Islands.

Day 2 Convective Outlook CORR 1
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0304 AM CDT Sun Aug 03 2025

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN ROCKIES INTO THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN PLAINS...

CORRECTED FOR FLIPPED LINE IN NORTHEAST

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms with severe gusts and hail will be possible
on Monday from parts of the northern Rockies into the Dakotas and
central High Plains.

...Northern Rockies/Northern High Plains...
A mid-level shortwave trough will move northeastward across the
Pacific Northwest on Monday. At the surface, a cold front will
advance eastward into the northern Rockies, as upslope easterly flow
remains over the northern High Plains. As surface temperatures warm,
thunderstorm development is expected during the afternoon near the
front, and in the higher terrain of the northern Rockies. These
storms will likely increase in coverage by early evening, moving
eastward into the northern High Plains. Surface dewpoints across
much central and eastern Montana are forecast to be in the upper 40s
and lower 50s F, which will contribute to the development of weak
instability by afternoon. Near the forecast pocket of instability,
forecast soundings suggest that 0-6 km shear will be in the 30 to 40
knot range. This, combined with steep low to mid-level lapse rates
near 8 C/km, will likely support an localized severe threat. The
stronger rotating cells could produce hail. Isolated severe gusts
will also be possible, mainly with short line segments that have
some organization.

...Central and Northern Plains...
A mid-level ridge will remain over the central Rockies on Monday, as
a trough remains nearly stationary across northern Minnesota. At the
surface, a north-to-south corridor of low-level moisture with
dewpoints in the 60s F, will be in place from central Kansas
northward into the eastern Dakotas. Moderate instability is forecast
to develop along the western edge of this moist airmass, from
western Nebraska into southwestern and central South Dakota. As
destabilization takes place during the day, isolated thunderstorm
development will be possible, mainly in areas where low-level
convergence becomes maximized. Across much of the region, 0-6 km
shear is forecast to be in the 35 to 45 knot range. This will
support an isolated threat for severe gusts. Hail will also be
possible in the central High Plains, where mid-level lapse rates are
forecast to be steep.
