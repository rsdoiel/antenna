Las Vegas has seen a drastic 7 percent decrease in tourism since the start of the year, largely due to rising travel costs and a Canadian boycott of travel to the United States, stemming from political tensions. Unemployment in the city surged to 5.8 percent in June, the third-highest among major U.S. metropolitan areas with populations exceeding one million. Las Vegas real estate is also taking a huge hit with an over 10 percent decline in year-over-year sales, and Inventory has skyrocketed by 44.8 percent. '/>
