and frustrated’: Thousands protest Trump days before his
inauguration</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON &amp;#8212; Some climbed into buses in the wee hours of the morning. Others boarded planes from across the country or drove bleary-eyed through the night. No matter how they got to Washington on Saturday, they shared a common goal: to protest against President-elect Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;

Watch: What tiny crystals can tell us about their trip through the magma
chamber</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Like fortune tellers who peer into a crystal ball for insight, volcanologists at the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory peer into the tiny crystals contained in lava flows to learn about the magma&amp;#8217;s journey before it was erupted onto the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

in Palermo</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-19, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;One thing I enjoy about returning to a destination is the chance to update the outdated impressions I&amp;#8217;ve held in my mind from previous visits. Europe is always changing &amp;#8212; and on my last visit to Sicily&amp;#8217;s capital of Palermo I discovered that it&amp;#8217;s become a whole new city in recent years. It&amp;#8217;s cleaner, safer, and more efficient than it was in years past. But it still retains its colorful edge &amp;#8212; and that&amp;#8217;s why I love it.&lt;/p&gt;
