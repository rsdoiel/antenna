<p>
In some tasks, AI is unreliable. In others, it is superhuman. You could,
of course, say the same thing about calculators, but it is also clear
that AI is different. It is already demonstrating general capabilities
and performing a wide range of intellectual tasks, including those that
it is not specifically trained on. Does that mean that o3 and Gemini 2.5
are AGI? Given the definitional problems, I really don’t know, but I do
think they can be credibly seen as a form of “Jagged AGI” - superhuman
in enough areas to result in real changes to how we work and live, but
also unreliable enough that human expertise is often needed to figure
out where AI works and where it doesn’t.

Now that Llama has very real competition in open weight models (Gemma 3,
latest Mistrals, DeepSeek, Qwen) I think their
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/14/open-ai-model-licenses-often-carry-concerning-restrictions/">janky
license</a> is becoming much more of a liability for them. It’s just
limiting enough that it could be the deciding factor for using something
else.

<h2 id="llm-fragments-github-0.2">llm-fragments-github 0.2</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-20, updated: 2025-04-20, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-fragments-github/releases/tag/0.2">llm-fragments-github
0.2</a></strong>
</p>
I upgraded my <code>llm-fragments-github</code> plugin to add a new
fragment type called <code>issue</code>. It lets you pull the entire
content of a GitHub issue thread into your prompt as a concatenated
Markdown file.
</p>
<p>
(If you haven’t seen fragments before I introduced them in
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/7/long-context-llm/">Long
context support in LLM 0.24 using fragments and template plugins</a>.)
</p>
<p>
I used it just now to have Gemini 2.5 Pro provide feedback and attempt
an implementation of a complex issue against my
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm">LLM</a> project:
</p>
<pre>llm install llm-fragments-github
llm -f github:simonw/llm \
  -f issue:simonw/llm/938 \
  -m gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 \
  --system <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>muse on this issue, then propose a whole bunch of code to help implement it<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre>
<p>
Here I’m loading the FULL content of the <code>simonw/llm</code> repo
using that <code>-f github:simonw/llm</code> fragment
(<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-fragments-github?tab=readme-ov-file#usage">documented
here</a>), then loading all of the comments from
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/938">issue 938</a> where I
discuss quite a complex potential refactoring. I ask Gemini 2.5 Pro to
“muse on this issue” and come up with some code.
</p>
<p>
This worked <em>shockingly</em> well. Here’s
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/a5f0c1e8184f4ddc8b71b30890fe690c#response">the
full response</a>, which highlighted a few things I hadn’t considered
yet (such as the need to migrate old database records to the new tree
hierarchy) and then spat out a whole bunch of code which looks like a
solid start to the actual implementation work I need to do.
</p>
<p>
I ran this against Google’s free Gemini 2.5 Preview, but if I’d used the
paid model it would have cost me 202,680 input tokens and 10,460 output
tokens for a total of 66.36 cents.
</p>
<p>
As a fun extra, the new <code>issue:</code> feature itself was written
almost entirely by OpenAI o3, again using fragments. I ran this:
</p>
<pre>llm -m openai/o3 \
  -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/llm-hacker-news/refs/heads/main/llm_hacker_news.py \
  -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/tools/refs/heads/main/github-issue-to-markdown.html \
  -s <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>Write a new fragments plugin in Python that registers issue:org/repo/123 which fetches that issue</span>
<span class="pl-s">      number from the specified github repo and uses the same markdown logic as the HTML page to turn that into a fragment<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre>
<p>
Here I’m using the ability to pass a URL to <code>-f</code> and giving
it the full source of my
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-hacker-news/blob/main/llm_hacker_news.py">llm_hacker_news.py</a>
plugin (which shows how a fragment can load data from an API) plus the
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/github-issue-to-markdown.html">HTML
source</a> of my
<a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/github-issue-to-markdown">github-issue-to-markdown</a>
tool (which I wrote a few months ago
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/cd1afb97e595b40fdeedebb48be7f4f1">with
Claude</a>). I effectively asked o3 to take that HTML/JavaScript tool
and port it to Python to work with my fragments plugin mechanism.
</p>
<p>
o3 provided
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/249e16edffe6350f7265012bee9e3305#response">almost
the exact implementation I needed</a>, and even implemented
<code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> environment variable without me thinking to
ask for it. Total cost: 19.928 cents.
</p>
<p>
On a final note of curiosity I tried running this prompt against
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/19/gemma-3-qat-models/">Gemma
3 27B QAT</a> running on my Mac via MLX and
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mlx">llm-mlx</a>:
</p>
<pre>llm install llm-mlx
llm mlx download-model mlx-community/gemma-3-27b-it-qat-4bit

llm -m mlx-community/gemma-3-27b-it-qat-4bit \
  -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/llm-hacker-news/refs/heads/main/llm_hacker_news.py \
  -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonw/tools/refs/heads/main/github-issue-to-markdown.html \
  -s <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>Write a new fragments plugin in Python that registers issue:org/repo/123 which fetches that issue</span>
<span class="pl-s">      number from the specified github repo and uses the same markdown logic as the HTML page to turn that into a fragment<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre>
<p>
<p>That worked
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/feccff6ce3254556b848c27333f52543#response">pretty
well too</a>. It turns out a 16GB local model file is powerful enough to
write me an LLM plugin now!</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-20, from: Rachel Kwon blog</p>
<p>
Last month I had the chance to travel to two places I previously lived.
In early March, I went to London for a work trip, and a couple of
weekends ago I went to Chicago for a friend’s milestone birthday. It was
a strange feeling to revisit these two cities where I’d lived and
existed before but in the distant past, long enough ago that it felt
like I was a different person.

Meta’s Llama claims to be open source because of the EU AI act</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-19, updated: 2025-04-19, from: Simon Willison’s

<p>
I encountered a theory a while ago that one of the reasons Meta insist
on using the term “open source” for their Llama models despite the Llama
license
<a href="https://opensource.org/blog/metas-llama-license-is-still-not-open-source">not
actually conforming</a> to the terms of the
<a href="https://opensource.org/osd">Open Source Definition</a> is that
the EU’s AI act includes special rules for open source models without
requiring OSI compliance.
</p>
<p>
Since the EU AI act (12 July 2024) is
<a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/the-act/">available
online</a> I decided to take a look for myself.
</p>
<p>
Here’s
<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689">one
giant HTML page</a> containing the full text of the act in English. I
checked the token count with
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/ttok">ttok</a> (which uses the OpenAI
tokenizer, but it’s close enough to work as a good estimate for other
models):
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>curl <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> <span class="pl-k">|</span> ttok</pre>
</div>
<p>
241,722 tokens. That should fit nicely into
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/17/start-building-with-gemini-25-flash/">Gemini
2.5 Flash</a> (or GPT-4.1 or Gemini 2.5 Pro).
</p>
<p>
My Gemini API key was playing up so I ran it via
<a href="https://openrouter.ai/">OpenRouter</a> (and
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter">llm-openrouter</a>)
instead:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>llm -f <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> \
  -m openrouter/google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview:thinking \
  -s <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>Summary of mentions of open source here, including what the document defines open source to mean<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre>
</div>
<p>
Here’s
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/f2e341a2e8ea9ca75c6426fa85bc2dfc">the
full answer</a>. Relevant extract:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Recital (89) states that third parties making accessible “tools,
services, processes, or AI components other than general-purpose AI
models” under a <strong>free and open-source licence</strong> should not
be mandated to comply with upstream provider responsibilities towards
those who integrate them. It also encourages developers of such
resources to implement documentation practices like model cards and data
sheets to promote trustworthy AI.
</li>
<li>
Recital (102) acknowledges that software and data, including models,
released under a <strong>free and open-source licence</strong> can
contribute to research and innovation and provide growth opportunities.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
I tracked down
<a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/recital/89/">Recital
89</a> and
<a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/recital/102/">Recital
102</a> to check. Sure enough, 89 says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Third parties making accessible to the public tools, services,
processes, or AI components other than general-purpose AI models, should
not be mandated to comply with requirements targeting the
responsibilities along the AI value chain
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And in 102:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
General-purpose AI models released under free and open-source licences
should be considered to ensure high levels of transparency and openness
if their parameters, including the weights, the information on the model
architecture, and the information on model usage are made publicly
available. The licence should be considered to be free and open-source
also when it allows users to run, copy, distribute, study, change and
improve software and data, including models under the condition that the
original provider of the model is credited, the identical or comparable
terms of distribution are respected.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Gemini 2.5 Flash also pointed me to
<a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/article/2/">Article
2(12)</a>, which reads:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li>This Regulation does not apply to AI systems released under free and
open-source licences, unless they are placed on the market or put into
service as high-risk AI systems or as an AI system that falls under
<a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/article/5">Article 5</a>
or <a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/article/50/">50</a>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I asked a follow-up question:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>llm -c <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>so it says specific licenses but does it clarify which specific licenses count?<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre>
</div>
<p>
And got
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/f2e341a2e8ea9ca75c6426fa85bc2dfc#response-1">back
this response</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
No, the document <strong>does not list specific names of
licenses</strong> that qualify as “free and open-source”.
</p>
<p>
Instead of listing names (like GPL, MIT, Apache, etc.), the Regulation
defines what kind of terms a license must grant for it to be considered
“free and open-source” for the purposes of the Regulation.
</p>
<p>
According to Recital (102), such a license must essentially allow
software and data, including models, to be:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Openly shared.</strong>
</li>
<li>
Where users can <strong>freely access, use, modify and
redistribute</strong> them or modified versions thereof.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Recital further clarifies that a license can still be considered
free and open-source even if it includes standard conditions like
requiring <strong>attribution (crediting the original provider)</strong>
or respecting <strong>identical or comparable terms of
distribution</strong>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I am very obviously not a lawyer, but based on the above I do find the
theory credible that Meta are using “open source” in their marketing
around Llama partly because the EU AI act has special exemptions for
“open source” models that have nothing to do with the OSI definition of
that term.
</p>
<p>
Total cost to use Gemini 2.5 Flash for this? 5.1 cents for my first
question and 4.3 cents for the follow-up. That second question was
cheaper even though it built on the first because output tokens are more
expensive than input tokens and the second answer was shorter than the
first - using the “thinking” model output is charged at $3.50/million
tokens, input is just $0.15/million.
</p>
<p>
Using an LLM as a lawyer is obviously a terrible idea, but using one to
crunch through a giant legal document and form a very rough layman’s
understanding of what it says feels perfectly cromulent to me.
</p></li>

<strong>Update:</strong> Steve O’Grady
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sogrady.org/post/3ln7ipdbaek2s">points
out</a> that Meta/Facebook have been abusing the term “open source” for
a lot longer than the EU AI act has been around - they were pulling
shenanigans with a custom license for React

<h2 id="claude-code-best-practices-for-agentic-coding">Claude Code: Best
practices for agentic coding</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-19, updated: 2025-04-19, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices">Claude
Code: Best practices for agentic coding</a></strong>
</p>
Extensive new documentation from Anthropic on how to get the best
results out of their
<a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code">Claude Code</a> CLI
coding agent tool, which includes this fascinating tip:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We recommend using the word “think” to trigger extended thinking mode,
which gives Claude additional computation time to evaluate alternatives
more thoroughly. These specific phrases are mapped directly to
increasing levels of thinking budget in the system: “think” &lt; “think
hard” &lt; “think harder” &lt; “ultrathink.” Each level allocates
progressively more thinking budget for Claude to use.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Apparently <strong>ultrathink</strong> is a magic word!
</p>
<p>
I was curious if this was a feature of the Claude model itself or Claude
Code in particular. Claude Code isn’t open source but you can view the
obfuscated JavaScript for it, and make it a tiny bit less obfuscated by
running it through <a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a>. With
<a href="https://claude.ai/share/77c398ec-6a8b-4390-91d3-6e9f0403916e">Claude’s
help</a> I used this recipe:
</p>
<pre><code>mkdir -p /tmp/claude-code-examine
cd /tmp/claude-code-examine
npm init -y
npm install @anthropic-ai/claude-code
cd node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code
npx prettier --write cli.js
</code></pre>
<p>
Then used <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> to
search for “ultrathink”:
</p>
<pre><code>rg ultrathink -C 30
</code></pre>
<p>
And found this chunk of code:

<p>
<p>So yeah, it looks like “ultrathink” is a Claude Code feature -
presumably that 31999 is a number that affects the token
<a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking#implementing-extended-thinking">thinking
budget</a>, especially since “megathink” maps to 1e4 tokens (10,000) and
just plain “think” maps to 4,000.</p>

<p>
<strong><a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemma-3-quantized-aware-trained-state-of-the-art-ai-to-consumer-gpus/">Gemma
3 QAT Models</a></strong>
</p>
Interesting release from Google, as a follow-up
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/12/gemma-3/">to Gemma 3</a>
from last month:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
To make Gemma 3 even more accessible, we are announcing new versions
optimized with Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) that dramatically
reduces memory requirements while maintaining high quality. This enables
you to run powerful models like Gemma 3 27B locally on consumer-grade
GPUs like the NVIDIA RTX 3090.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I wasn’t previously aware of Quantization-Aware Training but it turns
out to be quite an established pattern now, supported in both
<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/model_optimization/guide/quantization/training">Tensorflow</a>
and
<a href="https://pytorch.org/blog/quantization-aware-training/">PyTorch</a>.
</p>
<p>
Google report model size drops from BF16 to int4 for the following
models:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Gemma 3 27B: 54GB to 14.1GB
</li>
<li>
Gemma 3 12B: 24GB to 6.6GB
</li>
<li>
Gemma 3 4B: 8GB to 2.6GB
</li>
<li>
Gemma 3 1B: 2GB to 0.5GB
</li>
</ul>
<p>
They partnered with Ollama, LM Studio, MLX (here’s
<a href="https://huggingface.co/collections/mlx-community/gemma-3-qat-68002674cd5afc6f9022a0ae">their
collection</a>) and llama.cpp for this release - I’d love to see more AI
labs following their example.
</p>
<p>
The Ollama model version picker currently hides them behind “View all”
option, so here are the direct links:
</p>
<ul>

<li>
<a href="https://ollama.com/library/gemma3:27b-it-qat">gemma3:27b-it-qat</a>

</li>
</ul>
<p>
I fetched that largest model with:
</p>
<pre><code>ollama pull gemma3:27b-it-qat
</code></pre>
<p>
And now I’m trying it out with
<a href="https://github.com/taketwo/llm-ollama">llm-ollama</a>:
</p>
<pre><code>llm -m gemma3:27b-it-qat "impress me with some physics"
</code></pre>
<p>
I got
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/5b699ba6b7c05e2d071910e238823ff4">a
pretty great response</a>!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Update</strong>: Having spent a while putting it through its
paces via
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/27/open-webui/">Open
WebUI</a> and <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> to access
my laptop from my phone I think this may be my new favorite
general-purpose local model. Ollama appears to use 22GB of RAM while the
model is running, which leaves plenty on my 64GB machine for other
applications.
</p>
<p>
I’ve also tried it via
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mlx">llm-mlx</a> like this
(downloading 16GB):
</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-mlx
llm mlx download-model mlx-community/gemma-3-27b-it-qat-4bit
llm chat -m mlx-community/gemma-3-27b-it-qat-4bit
</code></pre>
<p>

Weblog</p>
<p>
It frustrates me when support sites for online services fail to
<em>link</em> to the things they are talking about. Cloudflare’s
<a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/setup/find-account-and-zone-ids/">Find
zone and account IDs</a> page for example provides a four step process
for finding my account ID that starts at the root of their dashboard,
including a screenshot of where I should click.
</p>
<p>
<img alt="1. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard. 2. Select your account and domain. 3. On the Overview page (the landing page for your domain), find the API section. Screenshot includes an Overview panel showing analytics" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/cloudflare-docs.jpg" style="max-width: 100%">
</p>
<p>
In Cloudflare’s case it’s harder to link to the correct dashboard page
because the URL differs for different users, but that shouldn’t be a
show-stopper for getting this to work. Set up
<code>dash.cloudflare.com/redirects/find-account-id</code> and link to
that!
</p>
<p>
… I just noticed they <em>do</em> have a mechanism like that which they
use elsewhere. On the
<a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/tokens/">R2
authentication page</a> they link to:
</p>
<pre><code>https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/r2/api-tokens
</code></pre>
<p>
The “find account ID” flow presumably can’t do the same thing because
there is no single page displaying that information - it’s shown in a
sidebar on the page for each of your Cloudflare domains.
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Tags: &lt;a href=&quot;https://simonwillison.net/tags/urls&quot;&gt;urls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://simonwillison.net/tags/usability&quot;&gt;usability&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://simonwillison.net/tags/cloudflare&quot;&gt;cloudflare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </code></pre>

judge, the eval should give A a significantly higher score than B.
</li>
<li>
If A and B have similar performance, their eval scores should be
similar.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Whenever a pair of systems A and B contradicts these criteria, that is a
sign the eval is in “error” and we should tweak it to make it rank A and
B correctly.

<h2 id="image-segmentation-using-gemini-2.5">Image segmentation using
Gemini 2.5</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-18, updated: 2025-04-18, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
Max Woolf pointed out this new feature of the Gemini 2.5 series (here’s
my coverage of
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/25/gemini/">2.5 Pro</a> and
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/17/start-building-with-gemini-25-flash/">2.5
Flash</a>) in
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43720845#43722227">a
comment</a> on Hacker News:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
One hidden note from Gemini 2.5 Flash when diving deep into the
documentation: for image inputs, not only can the model be instructed to
generated 2D bounding boxes of relevant subjects, but it can also
<a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/image-understanding#segmentation">create
segmentation masks</a>!
</p>
<p>
At this price point with the Flash model, creating segmentation masks is
pretty nifty.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I built a tool last year to
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Aug/26/gemini-bounding-box-visualization/">explore
Gemini’s bounding box abilities</a>. This new segmentation mask feature
represents a significant new capability!
</p>
<p>
Here’s my new tool to try it out:
<strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/gemini-mask">Gemini API
Image Mask Visualization</a></strong>. As with my bounding box tool it’s
browser-based JavaScript that talks to the Gemini API directly. You
provide it with a
<a href="https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey">Gemini API key</a>
which isn’t logged anywhere that I can see it.
</p>
<p>
This is what it can do:
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/mask-tool.jpg" alt="Screenshot of mask tool. At the top is a select box to pick a model (currently using Gemini 2.5 Pro) and a prompt that reads: Give the segmentation masks for the pelicans. Output a JSON list of segmentation masks where each entry contains the 2D bounding box in the key &quot;box_2d&quot; and the segmentation mask in key &quot;mask&quot;. Below that is JSON that came back - an array of objects. The mask keys are base64 encoded PNG data. Below that is the original image, then the image with masks overlaid and a coordinate system, then two columns showing each cropped image and mask next to each other." style="max-width: 100%;" />
</p>
<p>
Give it an image and a prompt of the form:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>Give the segmentation masks for the objects. Output a JSON list of
segmentation masks where each entry contains the 2D bounding box in the
key “box_2d” and the segmentation mask in key “mask”.</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
My tool then runs the prompt and displays the resulting JSON. The Gemini
API returns segmentation masks as base64-encoded PNG images in strings
that start <code>data:image/png;base64,iVBOR…</code>. The tool then
visualizes those in a few different ways on the page, including overlaid
over the original image.
</p>
<p>
I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/vibe-coding/">vibe coded</a>
the whole thing together using a combination of Claude and ChatGPT. I
started with
<a href="https://claude.ai/share/2dd2802a-c8b4-4893-8b61-0861d4fcb0f1">a
Claude Artifacts React prototype</a>, then pasted the code from my old
project into Claude and
<a href="https://claude.ai/share/9e42d82b-56c7-46c1-ad0c-fc67c3cad91f">hacked
on that until I ran out of tokens</a>. I transferred the incomplete
result to a new Claude session where I
<a href="https://claude.ai/share/f820f361-5aa7-48b5-a96d-f0f8b11d3869">kept
on iterating</a> until it got stuck in a bug loop (the same bug kept
coming back no matter how often I told it to fix that)… so I switched
over to O3 in ChatGPT
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/6801c8ad-18c8-8006-bdd8-447500eae33e">to
finish it off</a>.
</p>
<p>
Here’s
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/gemini-mask.html">the
finished code</a>. It’s a total mess, but it’s also less than 500 lines
of code and the interface solves my problem in that it lets me explore
the new Gemini capability.
</p>
<p>
Segmenting my pelican photo via the Gemini API was <em>absurdly</em>
inexpensive. Using Gemini 2.5 Pro the call cost 303 input tokens and 353
output tokens, for a total cost of 0.2144 cents (less than a quarter of
a cent). I ran it again with the new Gemini 2.5 Flash and it used 303
input tokens and 270 output tokens, for a total cost of 0.099 cents
(less than a tenth of a cent). I calculated these prices using my
<a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/llm-prices">LLM pricing
calculator</a> tool.
</p>
<h4 id="gemini-2-5-flash-non-thinking">
1/100th of a cent with Gemini 2.5 Flash non-thinking
</h4>
<p>
Gemini 2.5 Flash has two pricing models. Input is a standard
$0.15/million tokens, but the output charges differ a lot: in
non-thinking mode output is $0.60/million, but if you have thinking
enabled (the default) output is $3.50/million. I think of these as
“Gemini 2.5 Flash” and “Gemini 2.5 Flash Thinking”.
</p>
<p>
My initial experiments all used thinking mode. I decided to upgrade the
tool to try non-thinking mode, but noticed that the API library it was
using
(<a href="https://github.com/google-gemini/deprecated-generative-ai-js">google/generative-ai</a>)
is marked as deprecated.
</p>
<p>
On a hunch, I pasted the code into
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/16/introducing-openai-o3-and-o4-mini/">the
new o4-mini-high model</a> in ChatGPT and prompted it with:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>This code needs to be upgraded to the new recommended JavaScript
library from Google. Figure out what that is and then look up enough
documentation to port this code to it</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
o4-mini and o3 both have search tool access and claim to be good at
mixing different tool uses together.
</p>
<p>
This worked <em>extremely</em> well! It ran a few searches and
identified exactly what needed to change:
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/o4-thinking.jpg" alt="Screenshot of AI assistant response about upgrading Google Gemini API code. Shows &quot;Thought for 21 seconds&quot; followed by web search results for &quot;Google Gemini API JavaScript library recommended new library&quot; with options including Google AI for Developers, GitHub, and Google for Developers. The assistant explains updating from GoogleGenerativeAI library to @google-ai/generative, with code samples showing: import { GoogleGenAI } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@google/genai@latest'; and const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: getApiKey() });" style="max-width: 100%;" />
</p>
<p>
Then gave me detailed instructions along with an updated snippet of
code. Here’s
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68028f7b-11ac-8006-8150-00c4205a2507">the
full transcript</a>.
</p>
<p>
I prompted for a few more changes, then had to tell it not to use
TypeScript (since I like copying and pasting code directly out of the
tool without needing to run my own build step). The
<a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/gemini-mask">latest version</a>
has been rewritten by o4-mini for the new library, defaults to Gemini
2.5 Flash non-thinking and displays usage tokens after each prompt.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/mask-tool-non-thinking.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the new tool. Gemini 2.5 Flash non-thinking is selected. Same prompt as before. Input tokens: 303 • Output tokens: 123" style="max-width: 100%;" />
</p>
<p>
Segmenting my pelican photo in non-thinking mode cost me 303 input
tokens and 123 output tokens - that’s 0.0119 cents, just over 1/100th of
a cent!
</p>
<h4 id="but-this-looks-like-way-more-than-123-output-tokens">
But this looks like way more than 123 output tokens
</h4>
<p>
The JSON that’s returned by the API looks <em>way</em> too long to fit
just 123 tokens.
</p>
<p>
My hunch is that there’s an additional transformation layer here. I
think the Gemini 2.5 models return a much more efficient token
representation of the image masks, then the Gemini API layer converts
those into base4-encoded PNG image strings.
</p>
<p>
We do have one clue here: last year DeepMind
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/15/paligemma/">released
PaliGemma</a>, an open weights vision model that could generate
segmentation masks on demand.
</p>
<p>
The
<a href="https://github.com/google-research/big_vision/blob/main/big_vision/configs/proj/paligemma/README.md#tokenizer">README
for that model</a> includes this note about how their tokenizer works:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
PaliGemma uses the Gemma tokenizer with 256,000 tokens, but we further
extend its vocabulary with 1024 entries that represent coordinates in
normalized image-space (<code>&lt;loc0000&gt;…&lt;loc1023&gt;</code>),
and another with 128 entries
(<code>&lt;seg000&gt;…&lt;seg127&gt;</code>) that are codewords used by
a lightweight referring-expression segmentation vector-quantized
variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE) […]
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
My guess is that Gemini 2.5 is using a similar approach.

<h2 id="mcp-run-python">MCP Run Python</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-18, updated: 2025-04-18, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/tree/main/mcp-run-python">MCP
Run Python</a></strong>
</p>
Pydantic AI’s MCP server for running LLM-generated Python code in a
sandbox. They ended up using a trick I explored
<a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/deno/pyodide-sandbox">two years
ago</a>: using a <a href="https://deno.com/">Deno</a> process to run
<a href="https://pyodide.org/">Pyodide</a> in a WebAssembly sandbox.
</p>
<p>
Here’s a bit of a wild trick: since Deno loads code on-demand from
<a href="https://jsr.io/">JSR</a>, and
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/">uv run</a> can
install Python dependencies on demand via the <code>–with</code> option…
here’s a one-liner you can paste into a macOS shell (provided you have
Deno and <code>uv</code> installed already) which will run the example
from
<a href="https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/blob/v0.1.2/mcp-run-python/README.md">their
README</a> - calculating the number of days between two dates in the
most complex way imaginable:
</p>
<pre>ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>sk-ant-...<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> \

<span class="pl-s">import asyncio</span>
<span class="pl-s">from pydantic_ai import Agent</span>
<span class="pl-s">from pydantic_ai.mcp import MCPServerStdio</span>
<span class="pl-s"></span>
<span class="pl-s">server = MCPServerStdio(</span>
<span class="pl-s">    "deno",</span>
<span class="pl-s">    args=[</span>

<span class="pl-s"></span>
<span class="pl-s">asyncio.run(main())<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre>
<p>
I ran that just now and got:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The number of days between January 1st, 2000 and March 18th, 2025 is
9,208 days.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I thoroughly enjoy how tools like <code>uv</code> and Deno enable
throwing together shell one-liner demos like this one.

<p>
Here’s
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/54fc42ef9a7fb8f777162bbbfbba4f23">an
extended version</a> of this example which adds pretty-printed logging

happened. The most important piece is this tool call where Claude 3.5

<h2 id="simple-live-reload-for-developing-static-sites">Simple live
reload for developing static sites</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-18, from: Lean Rada’s blog</p>
<p>
When developing my website, I’m using a simple client-side script to
<strong>automatically reload the page</strong> whenever I make a change
to the source files.
</p>
<p>
Since it’s not coupled to any particular backend, I could continue using
<code>python3 -m http.server -d ./site/</code> or whatever local web
server I wanted and it would still work. I could clone this repo on a
new machine and get going with only preinstalled programs: a text
editor, a browser, and a Python (or whatever) HTTP server. And live
reload should<sup>*</sup> just work.

Here’s the code (39 lines):
</p>
<pre><code>let watching = new Set();
watch(location.href);

new PerformanceObserver((list) =&gt; {
  for (const entry of list.getEntries()) {
    watch(entry.name);
  }
}).observe({ type: "resource", buffered: true });

function watch(urlString) {
  if (!urlString) return;
  const url = new URL(urlString);
  if (url.origin !== location.origin) return;

  if (watching.has(url.pathname)) return;
  watching.add(url.pathname);

  console.log("watching", url.pathname);

  let lastModified, etag;

  async function check() {
    const res = await fetch(url, { method: "head" });
    const newLastModified = res.headers.get("Last-Modified");
    const newETag = res.headers.get("ETag");

    if (
      (lastModified !== undefined || etag !== undefined) &amp;&amp;
      (lastModified !== newLastModified || etag !== newETag)
    ) {
      location.reload();
    }

    lastModified = newLastModified;

<h2>
How it works, in a nutshell
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Start
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceObserver" target="_blank"><code>PerformanceObserver</code></a>
to watch loaded URLs
</li>
<li>
Poll
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/HEAD" target="_blank"><code>HEAD</code></a>
metadata
</li>
<li>
Check
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Last-Modified" target="_blank"><code>Last-Modified</code></a>
and
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/ETag" target="_blank"><code>ETag</code></a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>PerformanceObserver</strong> — This class was intended to
measure performance of things like network requests. But in this case it
was repurposed to record requested URLs so we can watch them for
changes. This includes lazy-loaded resources, and resources not in the
markup (e.g. imported JS modules)!
</p>
<p>
<strong>HEAD</strong> — Upon recording a requested URL, start polling
the URL with <code>HEAD</code> HTTP requests to get resource metadata.
Frequent polling should be fine if you’re using a local server which is
what I would expect for development. The response returned by
<code>HEAD</code> contains metadata useful for determining when to
refresh.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Last-Modified</strong> and <strong>ETag</strong> — These are the
headers used to indicate when the underlying resource has changed. The
script triggers a <code>location.reload()</code> when any of these
change.
</p>

<h2>
Story time
</h2>
<p>
I was directly inspired by
<strong><a href="https://livejs.com/" target="_blank">livejs</a></strong>
(2004), which polls headers as well. However, it has not been updated
for modern browsers. Instead of watching network requests, it scans the
markup for <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>
(CSS) resources.
</p>
<p>
In fact, I’ve been using livejs for a long while. I’ve never been fond
of the other solutions which require integration with your local
filesystem, via extra programs that you install and run. They always
seem to run slow or take up lots of resources, and sometimes choke if
there are errors.
</p>
<p>
I’m planning to make a fine-grained version of this module. Simple live
reloading is fine, but a more advanced <em>hot</em> reloading that
doesn’t always refresh the whole page would be great. For the modern
web, the advanced version must be able to
<a href="https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/issues/820" target="_blank">hot
reload WebComponents</a> in place, and do other fun stuff. I wonder if
it’s even possible. 🤔

Amazon uses an Android-based operating system called Fire OS for its
Amazon Fire line of tablets and Fire TV line of smart TVs. But a few
years ago we learned that the company was looking to move away from
Android for at least some of its devices. Some Echo Show products are
already shipping with […]

2.5 Flash</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-17, updated: 2025-04-17, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/start-building-with-gemini-25-flash/">Start
building with Gemini 2.5 Flash</a></strong>
</p>
Google Gemini’s latest model is Gemini 2.5 Flash, available in (paid)
preview as <code>gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17</code>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Building upon the popular foundation of 2.0 Flash, this new version
delivers a major upgrade in reasoning capabilities, while still
prioritizing speed and cost. Gemini 2.5 Flash is our first fully hybrid
reasoning model, giving developers the ability to turn thinking on or
off. The model also allows developers to set thinking budgets to find
the right tradeoff between quality, cost, and latency.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Gemini AI Studio product lead Logan Kilpatrick
<a href="https://twitter.com/OfficialLoganK/status/1912966500794654855">says</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This is an early version of 2.5 Flash, but it already shows huge gains
over 2.0 Flash.
</p>
<p>
You can fully turn off thinking if needed and use this model as a drop
in replacement for 2.0 Flash.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I added support to the new model in
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini/releases/tag/0.18">llm-gemini
0.18</a>. Here’s how to try it out:
</p>
<pre><code>llm install -U llm-gemini
llm -m gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17 'Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle'
</code></pre>
<p>
Here’s that first pelican, using the default setting where Gemini Flash
2.5 makes its own decision in terms of how much “thinking” effort to
apply:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Described below" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemini-2.5-flash-default.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
Here’s
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/afce6639ed10c712a0778fc779efd756">the
transcript</a>. This one used 11 input tokens and 4266 output tokens of
which 2702 were “thinking” tokens.
</p>
<p>
I asked the model to “<code>describe</code>” that image and it could
tell it was meant to be a pelican:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A simple illustration on a white background shows a stylized pelican
riding a bicycle. The pelican is predominantly grey with a black eye and
a prominent pink beak pouch. It is positioned on a black line-drawn
bicycle with two wheels, a frame, handlebars, and pedals.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The way the model is priced is a little complicated. If you have
thinking enabled, you get charged $0.15/million tokens for input and
$3.50/million for output. With thinking disabled those output tokens
drop to $0.60/million. I’ve added these
<a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/llm-prices">to my pricing
calculator</a>.
</p>
<p>
For comparison, Gemini 2.0 Flash is $0.10/million input and
$0.40/million for output.
</p>
<p>
So my first prompt - 11 input and 4266 output(with thinking enabled),
cost 1.4933 cents.
</p>
<p>
Let’s try 2.5 Flash again with thinking disabled:
</p>
<pre><code>llm -m gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17 'Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle' -o thinking_budget 0
</code></pre>
<p>
<img alt="Described below, again" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemini-2.5-flash-thinking-0.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
11 input, 1705 output. That’s 0.1025 cents.
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/182679e918ab5263f98f6a65691874d1">Transcript
here</a> - it still shows 25 thinking tokens even though I set the
thinking budget to 0 - Logan
<a href="https://twitter.com/OfficialLoganK/status/1912986097765789782">confirms</a>
that this will still be billed at the lower rate:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In some rare cases, the model still thinks a little even with thinking
budget = 0, we are hoping to fix this before we make this model stable
and you won’t be billed for thinking. The thinking budget = 0 is what
triggers the billing switch.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here’s Gemini 2.5 Flash’s self-description of that image:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A minimalist illustration shows a bright yellow bird riding a bicycle.
The bird has a simple round body, small wings, a black eye, and an open
orange beak. It sits atop a simple black bicycle frame with two large
circular black wheels. The bicycle also has black handlebars and black
and yellow pedals. The scene is set against a solid light blue
background with a thick green stripe along the bottom, suggesting grass
or ground.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And finally, let’s ramp the thinking budget up to the maximum:
</p>
<pre><code>llm -m gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17 'Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle' -o thinking_budget 24576
</code></pre>
<p>
<img alt="Described below" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemini-2.5-flash-thinking-max.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
I think it over-thought this one.
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/6a83bd7ad114ee23c460f5246b854247">Transcript</a>
- 5174 output tokens of which 3023 were thinking. A hefty 1.8111 cents!
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A simple, cartoon-style drawing shows a bird-like figure riding a
bicycle. The figure has a round gray head with a black eye and a large,
flat orange beak with a yellow stripe on top. Its body is represented by
a curved light gray shape extending from the head to a smaller gray
shape representing the torso or rear. It has simple orange stick legs
with round feet or connections at the pedals. The figure is bent forward
over the handlebars in a cycling position. The bicycle is drawn with
thick black outlines and has two large wheels, a frame, and pedals
connected to the orange legs. The background is plain white, with a dark
gray line at the bottom representing the ground.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
One thing I really appreciate about Gemini 2.5 Flash’s approach to SVGs
is that it shows very good taste in CSS, comments and general SVG class
structure. Here’s a truncated extract - I run a lot of these SVG tests
against different models and this one has a coding style that I
particularly enjoy. (Gemini 2.5 Pro
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/c34f7f0c94afcbeab77e170511f6f51f">does
this too</a>).

<p>
Our hypothesis is that o4-mini is a much better model, but we’ll wait to
hear feedback from developers. Evals only tell part of the story, and we
wouldn’t want to prematurely deprecate a model that developers continue
to find value in. Model behavior is extremely high dimensional, and it’s
impossible to prevent regression on 100% use cases/prompts, especially
if those prompts were originally tuned to the quirks of the older model.
But if the majority of developers migrate happily, then it may make
sense to deprecate at some future point.
</p>
<p>
We generally want to give developers as stable as an experience as
possible, and not force them to swap models every few months whether
they want to or not.

<p>date: 2025-04-16, updated: 2025-04-16, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-o3-and-o4-mini/">Introducing
OpenAI o3 and o4-mini</a></strong>
</p>
OpenAI are <em>really</em> emphasizing tool use with these:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
For the first time, our reasoning models can agentically use and combine
every tool within ChatGPT—this includes searching the web, analyzing
uploaded files and other data with Python, reasoning deeply about visual
inputs, and even generating images. Critically, these models are trained
to reason about when and how to use tools to produce detailed and
thoughtful answers in the right output formats, typically in under a
minute, to solve more complex problems.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I released
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openai-plugin/releases/tag/0.3">llm-openai-plugin
0.3</a> adding support for the two new models:
</p>
<pre><code>llm install -U llm-openai-plugin
llm -m openai/o3 "say hi in five languages"
llm -m openai/o4-mini "say hi in five languages"
</code></pre>
<p>
Here are
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/pelican-riding-a-bicycle/">the
pelicans riding bicycles</a> (prompt: <code>Generate an SVG of a pelican
riding a bicycle</code>).
</p>
<p>
<strong>o3</strong>:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Described by o3: The illustration shows a playful, stylized bicycle whose frame is drawn to resemble a duck. • The duck’s rounded body forms the bicycle’s seat area, and a small wing is sketched on its side.  • Its long neck stretches forward to become the top tube, ending in a simple head with a black eye and an orange, open beak that points ahead like handlebars.  • Two large black‑outlined wheels with thin, evenly spaced spokes complete the bike, while thin blue lines depict the rest of the frame, pedals, and chain.  • A dashed grey ground line runs beneath the wheels, giving the impression the duck‑bike is rolling along." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/o3-pelican.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
<strong>o4-mini</strong>:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Described by o4-mini: The image is a very simple, minimalistic line drawing of a bird riding a bicycle, rendered against a plain white background.  Key elements:   • Two large, identical circles for the bike’s wheels, outlined in thick black.   • A horizontal bar links the rear wheel to the bird’s body; a slanted bar links the front wheel to the bird.   • The front wheel has a single straight spoke ending in an arrowhead, suggesting the forward direction of travel.   • The bird itself is drawn with basic shapes:     – A small circle for the head, with a single dot for the eye and a short yellow triangle for the beak.     – An oval for the body.     – Thin lines for the neck, legs, and the bike’s pedals and handlebars.   • The bird appears perched on the saddle, its legs extending down to the pedals, and its tiny wings resting near the handlebars." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/o4-mini-pelican.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
Here are the full OpenAI model listings:
<a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/o3">o3</a> is
$10/million input and $40/million for output, with a 75% discount on
cached input tokens, 200,000 token context window, 100,000 max output
tokens and a May 31st 2024 training cut-off (same as the GPT-4.1
models). It’s a bit cheaper than o1 ($15/$60) and a <em>lot</em> cheaper
than o1-pro ($150/$600).
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/o4-mini">o4-mini</a> is
priced the same as o3-mini: $1.10/million for input and $4.40/million
for output, also with a 75% input caching discount. The size limits and
training cut-off are the same as o3.
</p>
<p>
You can compare these prices with other models using the table on my
<a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/llm-prices">updated LLM pricing
calculator</a>.
</p>
<p>
A new capability released today is that the OpenAI API can now
optionally return reasoning summary text. I’ve been exploring that
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openai-plugin/issues/16">in this
issue</a>. I believe you have to verify your organization (which may
involve a photo ID) in order to use this option - once you have access
the easiest way to see the new tokens is using <code>curl</code> like
this:
</p>
<pre><code>curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(llm keys get openai)" \
  -d '{
    "model": "o3",
    "input": "why is the sky blue?",
    "reasoning": {"summary": "auto"},
    "stream": true
  }'
</code></pre>
<p>
This produces a stream of events that includes this new event type:
</p>
<p>
<code>event: response.reasoning_summary_text.delta</code><br>
<code>data: {“type”: “response.reasoning_summary_text.delta”,“item_id”:
“rs_68004320496081918e1e75ddb550d56e0e9a94ce520f0206”,“output_index”:
0,“summary_index”: 0,“delta”: “**Expl”}</code>
</p>
<p>
Omit the <code>“stream”: true</code> and the response is easier to read
and contains this:
</p>

Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://github.com/openai/codex">openai/codex</a></strong>
</p>
Just released by OpenAI, a “lightweight coding agent that runs in your
terminal”. Looks like their version of
<a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview">Claude
Code</a>, though unlike Claude Code Codex is released under an open
source (Apache 2) license.
</p>
<p>
Here’s
<a href="https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/9b733fc48fb81b3f3460c1fdda111ba9b861f81f/codex-cli/src/utils/agent/agent-loop.ts#L1001-L1046">the
main prompt</a> that runs in a loop, which starts like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>You are operating as and within the Codex CLI, a terminal-based
agentic coding assistant built by OpenAI. It wraps OpenAI models to
enable natural language interaction with a local codebase. You are
expected to be precise, safe, and helpful.</code>
</p>
<p>
<code>You can:</code><br> <code>- Receive user prompts, project context,
and files.</code><br> <code>- Stream responses and emit function calls
(e.g., shell commands, code edits).</code><br> <code>- Apply patches,
run commands, and manage user approvals based on policy.</code><br>
<code>- Work inside a sandboxed, git-backed workspace with rollback
support.</code><br> <code>- Log telemetry so sessions can be replayed or
inspected later.</code><br> <code>- More details on your functionality
are available at codex –help</code><br>
</p>
<p>
<code>The Codex CLI is open-sourced. Don’t confuse yourself with the old
Codex language model built by OpenAI many moons ago (this is
understandably top of mind for you!). Within this context, Codex refers
to the open-source agentic coding interface. […]</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I like that the prompt describes OpenAI’s previous Codex language model
as being from “many moons ago”. Prompt engineering is so weird.
</p>
<p>
<p>Since the prompt says that it works “inside a sandboxed, git-backed
workspace” I went looking for the sandbox. On macOS
<a href="https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/9b733fc48fb81b3f3460c1fdda111ba9b861f81f/codex-cli/src/utils/agent/sandbox/macos-seatbelt.ts">it
uses</a> the little-known <code>sandbox-exec</code> process, part of the
OS but grossly under-documented. The best information I’ve found about
it is
<a href="https://www.karltarvas.com/macos-app-sandboxing-via-sandbox-exec.html">this
article from 2020</a>, which notes that <code>man sandbox-exec</code>

Weblog</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/a-field-guide-to-rapidly-improving-ai-products/">
<p>
The single most impactful investment I’ve seen AI teams make isn’t a
fancy evaluation dashboard—it’s building a customized interface that
lets anyone examine what their AI is actually doing. I emphasize
<em>customized</em> because every domain has unique needs that
off-the-shelf tools rarely address. When reviewing apartment leasing
conversations, you need to see the full chat history and scheduling
context. For real-estate queries, you need the property details and
source documents right there. Even small UX decisions—like where to
place metadata or which filters to expose—can make the difference
between a tool people actually use and one they avoid. […]
</p>
<p>
Teams with thoughtfully designed data viewers iterate 10x faster than
those without them. And here’s the thing: These tools can be built in
hours using AI-assisted development (like Cursor or Loveable). The
investment is minimal compared to the returns.

id="gpt-4.1-three-new-million-token-input-models-from-openai-including-their-cheapest-model-yet">GPT-4.1:
Three new million token input models from OpenAI, including their
cheapest model yet</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-14, updated: 2025-04-14, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
OpenAI <a href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-4-1/">introduced</a> three
new models this morning: GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini and GPT-4.1 nano. These
are API-only models right now, not available through the ChatGPT
interface (though you can try them out in OpenAI’s
<a href="https://platform.openai.com/playground">API playground</a>).
All three models can handle 1,047,576 tokens of input and 32,768 tokens
of output, and all three have a May 31, 2024 cut-off date (their
previous models were mostly September 2023).
</p>
<p>
The models score higher than GPT-4o <em>and</em> GPT-4.5 on coding
benchmarks, and do very well on long context benchmarks as well. They
also claim improvements in instruction following - following requested
formats, obeying negative instructions, sorting output and obeying
instructions to say “I don’t know”.
</p>
<p>
I released a new version of my
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openai-plugin">llm-openai</a>
plugin supporting the new models. This is a new thing for the
<a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> ecosystem: previously OpenAI
models were only supported in core, which meant I had to ship a full LLM
release to add support for them.
</p>
<p>
You can run the new models like this:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>llm install llm-openai-plugin -U
llm -m openai/gpt-4.1 <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span></pre>
</div>
<p>
The other model IDs are <code>openai/gpt-4.1-mini</code> and
<code>openai/gpt-4.1-nano</code>.
</p>
<p>
Here’s the
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/pelican-riding-a-bicycle/">pelican
riding a bicycle</a> I got from full sized GPT-4.1:
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gpt-4.1-pelican.jpg" alt="Not a terrible pelican on a bicycle. The frame is blue, though misshapen. The pelican's legs are detached from its body. It has a nice but square beak." style="max-width: 100%;" />
</p>
<p>
I’m particularly excited by
<a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4.1-nano">GPT-4.1
nano</a>, which handles image and text input up to a million tokens and
is priced lower than any other previous OpenAI model: $0.10/million for
input and $0.40/million for output, less than previous cheapest OpenAI
model GPT-4o-mini ($0.15/$0.60). I’ve updated my
<a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/llm-prices">LLM pricing
table</a> to include the new models.
</p>
<p>
They’re not the cheapest overall though: Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite and,
Gemini 1.5 Flash 8B, Amazon Nova Lite and Nova Micro and Mistral’s 3B,
8B and Small 3.1 hosted models remain less expensive.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/model-prices-april-14.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the table from that LLM pricing table link above. Amazon Nova Micro is cheapest at $0.035/million input tokens." style="max-width: 100%;" />
</p>
<p>
As a demonstration of just how cheap GPT-4.1 nano is, consider this
photograph I took of some pelicans:
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/two-pelicans.jpg" alt="Description to follow" style="max-width: 100%" />
</p>
<p>
I ran that through GPT-4.1 nano like this:
</p>
<pre>llm -m openai/gpt-4.1-nano describe \
  -a https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/two-pelicans.jpg</pre>
<p>
And got back this response:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The image shows two pelicans flying against a clear blue sky. They are
positioned in flight, with their wings extended, showcasing their large
wingspan and feather patterns. The pelican on the right appears slightly
higher and facing slightly to the left, while the pelican on the left is
oriented more horizontally with its beak pointing forward. Both birds
display a combination of brown, tan, and white plumage, characteristic
of pelicans, with their long beaks prominently visible.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Running <code>llm logs -c –usage</code> revealed that this used 1,933
input tokens and 96 output tokens. Passing those through
<a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/llm-prices">the pricing
calculator</a> returns a total cost of $0.000232, or 0.0232 cents.
</p>
<p>
That means I could use GPT-4.1 nano to generate descriptions of 4,310
images like this one for just shy of a dollar.
</p>
<p>
A few closing thoughts on these new models:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The 1 million input token context thing is a <em>really big deal</em>.
The huge token context has been a major competitive advantage for the
Google Gemini models for a full year at this point - it’s reassuring to
see other vendors start to catch up. I’d like to see the same from
Anthropic - Claude was the first model to hit 200,000 but hasn’t shipped
more than that yet (aside from a 500,000 token model that was restricted
to their big enterprise partners).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
When I added
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/7/long-context-llm/">fragments
support</a> to LLM last week the feature was mainly designed to help
take advantage of longer context models. It’s pleasing to see another
one show up so shortly after that release.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
OpenAI’s
<a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-caching">prompt
caching</a> mechanism offers an even bigger discount for the 4.1 models:
1/4 the price for input tokens if that same prefix has been used within
the past ~5-10 minutes. GPT-4o models only offer a 50% discount for
this.
</p>
<p>
A million token input costs 10 cents with GPT-4.1 nano, but that drops
to 2.5 cents if the same input is used again within the 5-10 minute
caching time limit.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
OpenAI really emphasized code performance for this model. They called
out the <a href="https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/">Aider
benchmark</a> in their announcement post.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/27/introducing-gpt-45/#confidence">As
expected</a>, GPT-4.5 turned out to be not long for this world:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We will also begin deprecating GPT‑4.5 Preview in the API, as GPT‑4.1
offers improved or similar performance on many key capabilities at much
lower cost and latency. GPT‑4.5 Preview will be turned off in three
months, on July 14, 2025, to allow time for developers to transition
</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA-P9ood-cE">the livestream
announcement</a> Michelle Pokrass
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/kA-P9ood-cE?t=17s">let slip</a>
that the codename for the model was Quasar - that’s the name of the
stealth model that’s
<a href="https://openrouter.ai/announcements/stealth-model-quasar-alpha">been
previewing on OpenRouter</a> for the past two weeks. That has
<a href="https://twitter.com/openrouterai/status/1911833662464864452">now
been confirmed</a> by OpenRouter.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
OpenAI shared a
<a href="https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt4-1_prompting_guide">GPT
4.1 Prompting Guide</a>, which includes this tip about long context
prompting:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Especially in long context usage, placement of instructions and context
can impact performance. If you have long context in your prompt, ideally
place your instructions at both the beginning and end of the provided
context, as we found this to perform better than only above or below. If
you’d prefer to only have your instructions once, then above the
provided context works better than below.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Adding instructions before the content is incompatible with
<a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-caching">prompt
caching</a> - I always keep the user’s varying question at the end,
after any longer system instructions or documents, since doing so means
multiple different questions can benefit from OpenAI’s prefix cache.
</p>
<p>
They also recommend XML-style delimiters over JSON for long context,
suggesting this format (complete with the XML-invalid unquoted
attribute) that’s similar to the format
<a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags">recommended
by Anthropic</a> for Claude:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-text-xml">
<pre>&lt;<span class="pl-ent">doc</span> <span class="pl-e">id</span>=1 <span class="pl-e">title</span>=<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>The Fox<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>&gt;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog&lt;/<span class="pl-ent">doc</span>&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p>
There’s an extensive section at the end
<a href="https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt4-1_prompting_guide#appendix-generating-and-applying-file-diffs">describing
their recommended approach to applying file diffs</a>: “we open-source
here one recommended diff format, on which the model has been
extensively trained”.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
One thing notably absent from the GPT-4.1 announcement is any mention of
audio support. The “o” in GPT-4o stood for “omni”, because it was a
multi-modal model with image and audio input and output. The 4.1 models
appear to be text and image input and text output only.
</p>

<p>
Today, on World Quantum Day, we celebrate the incredible advancements in
quantum computing—a technology poised to revolutionize industries from
healthcare to telecommunications. But as we marvel at its potential, we
must also confront the challenges it brings, particularly the
existential threat it poses to current encryption systems. At Purism, we
are not just preparing for this future; we are actively shaping it by
integrating post-quantum cryptography (PQC) into our devices and
solutions.

LLMs as the first line of support in Open Source</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-14, updated: 2025-04-14, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://noumenal.es/posts/llms-for-user-support/WZb/">Using
LLMs as the first line of support in Open Source</a></strong>
</p>
From reading the title I was nervous that this might involve automating
the initial response to a user support query in an issue tracker with an
LLM, but Carlton Gibson has better taste than that.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The <strong>open contribution</strong> model engendered by GitHub —
where anonymous (to the project) users can create issues, and comments,
which are almost always extractive support requests — results in an
effective <strong>denial-of-service attack against maintainers</strong>.
[…]
</p>
<p>
For anonymous users, who really just want help almost all the time, the
pattern I’m settling on is to facilitate them getting their answer from
their LLM of choice. […] we can generate a file that we offer users to
download, then we tell the user to pass this to (say) Claude with a
simple prompt for their question.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This resonates with the concept proposed by
<a href="https://llmstxt.org/">llms.txt</a> - making LLM-friendly
context files available for different projects.
</p>
<p>
My
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/docs-for-llms">simonw/docs-for-llms</a>
contains my own early experiment with this: I’m running a build script
to create LLM-friendly concatenated documentation for several of my
projects, and my
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-docs">llm-docs</a> plugin
(<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/7/long-context-llm/#asking-questions-of-llm-s-documentation">described
here</a>) can then be used to ask questions of that documentation.
</p>
<p>
It’s possible to pre-populate the Claude UI with a prompt by linking to
<code>https://claude.ai/new?q={PLACE_HOLDER}</code>, but it looks like
there’s quite a short length limit on how much text can be passed that
way. It would be neat if you could pass a URL to a larger document
instead.
</p>
<p>
<p>ChatGPT also supports
<code>https://chatgpt.com/?q=your-prompt-here</code> (again with a short
length limit) and directly executes the prompt rather than waiting for
you to edit it first(!)</p>

<h2 id="sanitizer-fun">sanitizer-fun</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-13, from: Keith P’s blog</p>
<h2>
Fun with -fsanitize=undefined and Picolibc
</h2>
<p>
Both GCC and Clang support the -fsanitize=undefined flag which
instruments the generated code to detect places where the program
wanders into parts of the C language specification which are either
undefined or implementation defined. Many of these are also common
programming errors. It would be great if there were sanitizers for other
easily detected bugs, but for now, at least the undefined sanitizer does
catch several useful problems.
</p>
<h2>
Supporting the sanitizer
</h2>
<p>
The sanitizer can be built to either trap on any error or call handlers.
In both modes, the same problems are identified, but when trap mode is
enabled, the compiler inserts a trap instruction and doesn’t expect the
program to continue running. When handlers are in use, each identified
issue is tagged with a bunch of useful data and then a specific
sanitizer handling function is called.
</p>
<p>
The specific functions are not all that well documented, nor are the
parameters they receive. Maybe this is because both compilers provide an
implementation of all of the functions they use and don’t really expect
external implementations to exist? However, to make these useful in an
embedded environment, picolibc needs to provide a complete set of
handlers that support all versions both gcc and clang as the
compiler-provided versions depend upon specific C (and C++) libraries.
</p>
<p>
Of course, programs can be built in trap-on-error mode, but that makes
it much more difficult to figure out what went wrong.
</p>
<h2>
Fixing Sanitizer Issues
</h2>
<p>
Once the sanitizer handlers were implemented, picolibc could be built
with them enabled and all of the picolibc tests run to uncover issues
within the library.
</p>
<p>
As with the static analyzer adventure from last year, the vast bulk of
sanitizer complaints came from invoking undefined or
implementation-defined behavior in harmless ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Computing pointers past &amp;array[size+1]. I found no cases where the
resulting pointers were actually used, but the mere computation is still
undefined behavior. These were fixed by adjusting the code to avoid
computing pointers like this. The result was clearer code, which is
good.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Signed arithmetic overflow in PRNG code. There are several linear
congruential PRNGs in the library which used signed integer arithmetic.
The rand48 generator carefully used unsigned short values. Of course, in
C, the arithmetic performed on them is done with signed ints if int is
wider than short. C specifies signed overflow as undefined, but both gcc
and clang generate the expected code anyways. The fixes here were
simple; just switch the computations to unsigned arithmetic, adjusting
types and inserting casts as required.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Passing pointers to the middle of a data structure. For example, free
takes a pointer to the start of an allocation. The management structure
appears just before that in memory; computing the address of which
appears to be undefined behavior to the compiler. The only fix I could
do here was to disable the sanitizer in functions doing these
computations – the sanitizer was mis-detecting correct code and it
doesn’t provide a way to skip checks on a per-operator basis.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Null pointer plus or minus zero. C says that any arithmetic with the
NULL pointer is undefined, even when the value being added or subtracted
is zero. The fix here was to create a macro, enabled only when the
sanitizer is enabled, which checks for this case and skips the
arithmetic.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Discarded computations which overflow. A couple of places computed a
value, then checked if that would have overflowed and discard the
result. Even though the program doesn’t depend upon the computation, its
mere presence is undefined behavior. These were fixed by moving the
computation into an <code>else</code> clause in the overflow check. This
inserts an extra branch instruction, which is annoying.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Signed integer overflow in math code. There’s a common pattern in
various functions that want to compare against 1.0. Instead of using the
floating point equality operator, they do the computation using the two
32-bit halves with ((hi - 0x3ff00000) | lo) == 0. It’s efficient, but
because most of these functions store the ‘hi’ piece in a signed integer
(to make checking the sign bit fast), the result is undefined when hi is
a large negative value. These were fixed by inserting casts to unsigned
types as the results were always tested for equality.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Signed integer shifts
</h3>
<p>
This is one area where the C language spec is just wrong.
</p>
<p>
For left shift, before C99, it worked on signed integers as a bit-wise
operator, equivalent to the operator on unsigned integers. After that,
left shift of negative integers became undefined. Fortunately, it’s
straightforward (if tedious) to work around this issue by just casting
the operand to unsigned, performing the shift and casting it back to the
original type. Picolibc now has an internal macro, <code>lsl</code>,
which does this:
</p>
<pre><code>    #define lsl(__x,__s) ((sizeof(__x) == sizeof(char)) ?                   \
                          (__typeof(__x)) ((unsigned char) (__x) &lt;&lt; (__s)) :  \
                          (sizeof(__x) == sizeof(short)) ?                  \
                          (__typeof(__x)) ((unsigned short) (__x) &lt;&lt; (__s)) : \
                          (sizeof(__x) == sizeof(int)) ?                    \
                          (__typeof(__x)) ((unsigned int) (__x) &lt;&lt; (__s)) :   \
                          (sizeof(__x) == sizeof(long)) ?                   \
                          (__typeof(__x)) ((unsigned long) (__x) &lt;&lt; (__s)) :  \
                          (sizeof(__x) == sizeof(long long)) ?              \
                          (__typeof(__x)) ((unsigned long long) (__x) &lt;&lt; (__s)) : \
                          __undefined_shift_size(__x, __s))
</code></pre>
<p>
Right shift is significantly more complicated to implement. What we want
is an arithmetic shift with the sign bit being replicated as the value
is shifted rightwards. C defines no such operator. Instead, right shift
of negative integers is implementation defined. Fortunately, both gcc
and clang define the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> operator on signed integers
as arithmetic shift. Also fortunately, C hasn’t made this undefined, so
the program itself doesn’t end up undefined.
</p>
<p>
The trouble with arithmetic right shift is that it is <em>not</em>
equivalent to right shift of unsigned values. Here’s what Per Vognsen
came up with using standard C operators:
</p>
<pre><code>    int
    __asr_int(int x, int s) {
        return x &lt; 0 ? ~(~x &gt;&gt; s) : x &gt;&gt; s;
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
When the value is negative, we invert all of the bits (making it
positive), shift right, then flip all of the bits back. Both GCC and
Clang seem to compile this to a single asr instruction. This function is
replicated for each of the five standard integer types and then the set
of them wrapped in another sizeof-selecting macro:
</p>
<pre><code>    #define asr(__x,__s) ((sizeof(__x) == sizeof(char)) ?           \
                          (__typeof(__x))__asr_char(__x, __s) :       \
                          (sizeof(__x) == sizeof(short)) ?          \
                          (__typeof(__x))__asr_short(__x, __s) :      \
                          (sizeof(__x) == sizeof(int)) ?            \
                          (__typeof(__x))__asr_int(__x, __s) :        \
                          (sizeof(__x) == sizeof(long)) ?           \
                          (__typeof(__x))__asr_long(__x, __s) :       \
                          (sizeof(__x) == sizeof(long long)) ?      \
                          (__typeof(__x))__asr_long_long(__x, __s):   \
                          __undefined_shift_size(__x, __s))
</code></pre>
<p>
The lsl and asr macros use sizeof instead of the type-generic mechanism
to remain compatible with compilers that lack type-generic support.
</p>
<p>
Once these macros were written, they needed to be applied where
required. To preserve the benefits of detecting programming errors, they
were only applied where required, not blindly across the whole codebase.
</p>
<p>
There are a couple of common patterns in the math code using shift
operators. One is when computing the exponent value for subnormal
numbers.
</p>
<pre><code>for (ix = -1022, i = hx &lt;&lt; 11; i &gt; 0; i &lt;&lt;= 1)
    ix -= 1;
</code></pre>
<p>
This code computes the exponent by shifting the significand left by 11
bits (the width of the exponent field) and then incrementally shifting
it one bit at a time until the sign flips, which indicates that the
most-significant bit is set. Use of the pre-C99 definition of the left
shift operator is intentional here; so both shifts are replaced with our
lsl operator.
</p>
<p>
In the implementation of pow, the final exponent is computed as the sum
of the two exponents, both of which are in the allowed range. The
resulting sum is then tested to see if it is zero or negative to see if
the final value is sub-normal:
</p>
<pre><code>hx += n &lt;&lt; 20;
if (hx &gt;&gt; 20 &lt;= 0)
    /* do sub-normal things */
</code></pre>
<p>
In this case, the exponent adjustment, <code>n</code>, is a signed value
and so that shift is replaced with the <code>lsl</code> macro. The test
value needs to compute the correct the sign bit, so we replace this with
the <code>asr</code> macro.
</p>
<p>
Because the right shift operation is not undefined, we only use our
fancy macro above when the undefined behavior sanitizer is enabled. On
the other hand, the lsl macro should have zero cost and covers undefined
behavior, so it is always used.
</p>
<h2>
Actual Bugs Found!
</h2>
<p>
The goal of this little adventure was both to make using the undefined
behavior sanitizer with picolibc possible as well as to use the
sanitizer to identify bugs in the library code. I fully expected that
most of the effort would be spent masking harmless undefined behavior
instances, but was hopeful that the effort would also uncover real bugs
in the code. I was not disappointed. Through this work, I found (and
fixed) eight bugs in the code:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
setlocale/newlocale didn’t check for NULL locale names
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
qsort was using uintptr_t to swap data around. On MSP430 in ‘large’
mode, that’s a 20-bit type inside a 32-bit representation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
random() was returning values in <code>int</code> range rather than
<code>long</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
m68k assembly for memcpy was broken for sizes &gt; 64kB.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
freopen returned NULL, even on success
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The optimized version of memrchr was <em>always</em> performing
unaligned accesses.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
String to float conversion had a table missing four values. This caused
an array access overflow which resulted in imprecise values in some
cases.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
vfwscanf mis-parsed floating point values by assuming that
<code>wchar_t</code> was unsigned.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>
Sanitizer Wishes
</h2>
<p>
While it’s great to have a way to detect places in your C code which
evoke undefined and implementation defined behaviors, it seems like this
tooling could easily be extended to detect other common programming
mistakes, even where the code is well defined according to the language
spec. An obvious example is in unsigned arithmetic. How many bugs come
from this seemingly innocuous line of code?
</p>
<pre><code>    p = malloc(sizeof(*p) * c);
</code></pre>
<p>
Because sizeof returns an unsigned value, the resulting computation
never results in undefined behavior, even when the multiplication wraps
around, so even with the undefined behavior sanitizer enabled, this bug
will not be caught. Clang seems to have an unsigned integer overflow
sanitizer which should do this, but I couldn’t find anything like this
in gcc.
</p>
<h2>
Summary
</h2>
<p>
The undefined behavior sanitizers present in clang and gcc both provide
useful diagnostics which uncover some common programming errors. In most
cases, replacing undefined behavior with defined behavior is
straightforward, although the lack of an arithmetic right shift operator
in standard C is irksome. I recommend anyone using C to give it a try.

a hackable AI assistant using a single SQLite table and a handful of
cron jobs</a></strong>
</p>
Geoffrey Litt reports on Stevens, a shared digital assistant he put
together for his family using SQLite and scheduled tasks running on Val
Town.
</p>
<p>
The design is refreshingly simple considering how much it can do.
Everything works around a single <code>memories</code> table. A memory
has text, tags, creation metadata and an optional <code>date</code> for
things like calendar entries and weather reports.
</p>
<p>
Everything else is handled by scheduled jobs to popular weather
information and events from Google Calendar, a Telegram integration
offering a chat UI and a neat system where USPS postal email delivery
notifications are run through Val’s own email handling mechanism to
trigger a Claude prompt to add those as memories too.
</p>
