## The Year in Review 2024 by Ian Mond

date: 2025-02-06, from: Locus Magazine

<p>After the slam dunk that was 2023, I had high hopes for 2024 ‚Äì too high, as it turns out. 2023 was a rare vintage, the 1999 of films in book form (Okay, maybe not that good). To expect that 2024 would scale those same heady heights was asking too much of the year, especially one already burdened by a world-shaping American election. Not that genre fiction schedules are influenced  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/02/the-year-in-review-2024-by-ian-mond/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## How To Write a Contained Screenplay: 8 Great Scripts With One Location

<p>Contained screenwriting can be challenging. Not everyone is wired to tell a story that involves only a small amount of characters and that mostly happens in just one or two locations. But like most creative endeavors, the right kind of limitations can produce surprising benefits. Placing boundaries on your screenplay can create dynamic storytelling opportunities, not to mention that contained screenplays typically have a lower budget. And that could make the difference between being an aspiring screenwriter versus <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/3-must-ask-questions-before-you-write-a-sellable-script">a produced screenwriter</a>.&nbsp;<br><br>Here‚Äôs everything you need to know about writing a contained screenplay, and why limitations might just launch your screenwriting career.</p>

## What Editing Can You Teach You About Screenwriting

date: 2025-02-05, from: Final Draft blog

<div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"> 
 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/what-editing-can-you-teach-you-about-screenwriting" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/What%20Editing%20Can%20You%20Teach%20You%20About%20Screenwriting.png" alt="Image of a film editor's video timeline on a computer screen." class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<p>There‚Äôs a clich√© in Hollywood that a film is made three times: once on the page in the form of a screenplay, the second time is on set when it‚Äôs shot with the director and actors, and the third time is in the editing bay. While any filmmaker can argue that each stage of ‚Äúmaking‚Äù the movie is equally important, it‚Äôs in the edit where the story is finalized and often defined more by what is cut out than by what is left in.&nbsp;<br><br>Many of the industry‚Äôs greatest screenwriters started their careers as editors, including Steven Zaillian (<em>Schindler‚Äôs List</em>, 1993), Steven Soderbergh (<em>Traffic</em>, 2000), and Joel Coen (<em>No Country for Old Men</em>, 2007). All three filmmakers have distinct visual styles, a knack for clear and concise storytelling and the ability to create effective pacing. These skills were no doubt formed and strengthened while spending hundreds of hours going over raw footage and slowly piecing it all together.&nbsp;<br><br><a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/tag/podcast">Final Draft‚Äôs Write On podcast</a> recently interviewed Josh Salzberg, co-screenwriter (along with Shira Piven), for the new film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15300212/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_the%2520performance" style="font-style: italic;">The Performance</a>, starring Jeremy Piven and Robert Carlyle, about a vaudeville dance troupe hired to perform in Nazi Germany. <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/write-on-the-performance-co-writer-josh-salzberg">Salzberg shared how being an editor helped him learn the craft of screenwriting</a>.&nbsp;</p>

## The Year in Review 2024 by Archita Mittra

## Under the Eye of the Big Bird by Hiromi Kawakami: Review by Niall Harrison

## Filmmaker Cooper Raiff Talks "Bumping" in Screenwriting

</div> 
<p>If there‚Äôs one writer/director whose work I‚Äôve been consistently excited by and whose name at festivals promises a project both heartbreakingly raw and funny, it‚Äôs <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4323708/">Cooper Raiff</a>.&nbsp;<br><br>He was a SXSW breakout in 2020 with college comedy <span style="font-style: italic;">Shithouse</span>, which snagged him the fest‚Äôs Grand Jury Award. And in 2022 took a step into more adult territory with the Sundance Film Festival premiere of <span style="font-style: italic;">Cha Cha Real Smooth</span>, which won the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2022/01/cha-cha-real-smooth-sundance-win-cooper-raiff-dakota-johnson.html">Audience Award</a> in the U.S. Dramatic category.<br><br>This year, he is back at Sundance with an episodic work, <a href="https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/6753360063b9434588c22178" style="font-style: italic;">Hal &amp; Harper</a>. The series follows two codependent siblings (Raiff and Lili Reinhart) who, years after a traumatic event in their family, still haven‚Äôt quite recovered. That pain seeps into their messy present-day relationships, including the ones they have with their dad (Mark Ruffalo) and his new partner (Betty Gilpin). When we get flashbacks into their childhood, Raiff and Reinhart play their grade-school versions of the characters, forced to mature too soon.<br><br>Raiff is always highly involved in his projects, writing and directing as well as starring, and he brings a singular sensibility to the work that‚Äôs a bit hard to pin down‚Äîsomething about an awkward honesty, naturalistic dialogue, moments of emotional punch that feel familiar and real. &nbsp;<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Hal &amp; Harper</span> is no different, but as an episodic, the story is a bit more freewheeling, interwoven with <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/frame-story-flashback">past and present threads</a> that slowly unravel the family‚Äôs anguish.<br><br>Final Draft spoke with Raiff ahead of Sundance to learn what was different about his approach to episodic work, his methods for building characters that he might not fully understand in the beginning, and how the writing comes together on set.&nbsp;</p>
