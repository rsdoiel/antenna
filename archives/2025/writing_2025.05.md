## The Year in Review 2024 by Archita Mittra

date: 2025-02-04, from: Locus Magazine

<p>2024 was bit of an irregular year for me, reading-wise. As per my notebooks, I read around 90 books (alas, less than my last year’s score of 110 on Goodreads) – the main course obviously be­ing speculative fiction, with a small dessert sampling of literary fiction, romances, comics and non-fiction. The meal wasn’t entirely satisfying, as there were plenty of anticipated titles that I didn’t get to read, and plenty  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/02/the-year-in-review-2024-by-archita-mittra/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Under the Eye of the Big Bird by Hiromi Kawakami: Review by Niall Harrison

date: 2025-02-04, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Under the Eye of the Big Bird</strong>, Hiromi Kawakami (Soft Skull 978-1-59376-611-5, $27.00, 278pp, hc) September 2024.</p>
<p>Hiromi Kawakami is one of those authors whose long and decorated career has, thanks to the vagaries of translation and market dynamics, appeared in English in a slightly scrambled form. Almost certainly her best-known novel in English is <strong>Sensei no kaban </strong>(2001), first released as <strong>The Briefcase </strong>in 2012, and then re-edited  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/02/under-the-eye-of-the-big-bird-by-hiromi-kawakami-review-by-niall-harrison/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

<p><strong>Here&#8217;s a highlight from our 2024 Recommended Reading List: The Man Who Saw Seconds</strong> by Alexander Boldizar, out from CLASH Books.</p>
<p>From the Locus review by Alexandra Pierce, available in the April 2024 issue (excerpted):</p>
<p><strong>The Man Who Saw Seconds </strong>is an action thriller that uses an age-old trope – when a man is wronged, his family threatened, how will he respond? – that is genuinely thrilling: the pacing is  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/02/from-the-2024-recommended-reading-list-the-man-who-saw-seconds-by-alexander-boldizar/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Filmmaker Cooper Raiff Talks "Bumping" in Screenwriting

date: 2025-02-03, from: Final Draft blog

<div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"> 
 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/filmmaker-cooper-raiff-talks-bumping-in-screenwriting" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/Lili%20Reinhart%20and%20Cooper%20Raiff%20in%20Hal%20%26%20Harper.png" alt="Lili Reinhart and Cooper Raiff hugging Mark Ruffalo in the episodic series 'Hal &amp; Harper'" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<p>If there’s one writer/director whose work I’ve been consistently excited by and whose name at festivals promises a project both heartbreakingly raw and funny, it’s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4323708/">Cooper Raiff</a>.&nbsp;<br><br>He was a SXSW breakout in 2020 with college comedy <span style="font-style: italic;">Shithouse</span>, which snagged him the fest’s Grand Jury Award. And in 2022 took a step into more adult territory with the Sundance Film Festival premiere of <span style="font-style: italic;">Cha Cha Real Smooth</span>, which won the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2022/01/cha-cha-real-smooth-sundance-win-cooper-raiff-dakota-johnson.html">Audience Award</a> in the U.S. Dramatic category.<br><br>This year, he is back at Sundance with an episodic work, <a href="https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/6753360063b9434588c22178" style="font-style: italic;">Hal &amp; Harper</a>. The series follows two codependent siblings (Raiff and Lili Reinhart) who, years after a traumatic event in their family, still haven’t quite recovered. That pain seeps into their messy present-day relationships, including the ones they have with their dad (Mark Ruffalo) and his new partner (Betty Gilpin). When we get flashbacks into their childhood, Raiff and Reinhart play their grade-school versions of the characters, forced to mature too soon.<br><br>Raiff is always highly involved in his projects, writing and directing as well as starring, and he brings a singular sensibility to the work that’s a bit hard to pin down—something about an awkward honesty, naturalistic dialogue, moments of emotional punch that feel familiar and real. &nbsp;<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Hal &amp; Harper</span> is no different, but as an episodic, the story is a bit more freewheeling, interwoven with <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/frame-story-flashback">past and present threads</a> that slowly unravel the family’s anguish.<br><br>Final Draft spoke with Raiff ahead of Sundance to learn what was different about his approach to episodic work, his methods for building characters that he might not fully understand in the beginning, and how the writing comes together on set.&nbsp;</p>

## Augur: Short Fiction Reviews by A.C. Wise

date: 2025-02-03, from: Locus Magazine

<p>Augur 7.2</p>
<p>“<strong>Telling the Soul of Mars</strong>” by <strong>Alina Pete </strong>starts Augur 7.2 on a strong note. It’s a lovely story that explores the power and limits of language and narrative, and how the traditions of storytelling might change and evolve with space travel. A storyteller born on Mars visits Earth for the first time and struggles with how to express the es­sence of her home to those  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/02/augur-short-fiction-reviews-by-a-c-wise-2/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## The Year in Review 2024 by Gary K. Wolfe

date: 2025-02-02, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>2024: Descent </strong><strong>(or Ascent) into </strong><strong>Multiplicity</strong></p>
<p>It’s a bit bracing to be reminded that I’ve been writing these yearly re­view columns for more than three decades, but it does put things in per­spective. Some of the books mentioned in those first couple of col­umns, of course, are barely remembered now, but others still seem to be a significant part of the discussion – Connie Willis’s <strong>Doomsday Book</strong>, Neal Stephenson’s  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/02/the-year-in-review-2024-by-gary-k-wolfe/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## The Sunday Morning Transport, The Deadlands, and The Dark: Short Fiction Reviews by Paula Guran

date: 2025-02-02, from: Locus Magazine

<p>The Sunday Morning Transport (9/22/24 – 12/01/24)
The Deadlands Fall ’24
The Dark 12/24</p>
<p>The Sunday Morning Transport publishes out­standing fiction weekly. All the stories are commendable, but here are my favorites of their fall offerings. If, as I did, you felt sympathy for Hermione’s muggle parents, “<strong>F*** These Wizards</strong>” by <strong>Alex London </strong>(9/22) is a story you will enjoy. And even if you aren’t a Harry Potter  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/02/the-sunday-morning-transport-the-deadlands-and-the-dark-short-fiction-reviews-by-paula-guran/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
