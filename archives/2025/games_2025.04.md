date: 2025-01-28, updated: 2025-01-28, from: Polygon Website

Trading in Pokémon TCG Pocket has been known since the app’s announcement back in Feb. 2024, but the trade button in the Social Hub has been grayed-out and slapped with a “coming soon” sticker since launch.

If I had to pick a throughline for the 2024 Dungeons &#38; Dragons rules refresh (aka One D&#38;D, D&#38;D 2024, 5.5 edition, or whatever they’re calling or not calling it this week), it would be customization.

Following the official announcement of this year’s Oscars nominees, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has announced the winners of the 2025 scientific and technical awards, which typically aren’t part of (and are barely acknowledged at) the annual televised ceremony.

## Marvel Rivals player proves why Moon Knight is actually unfair

date: 2025-01-27, updated: 2025-01-28, from: Polygon Website

One of the most annoying Marvel Rivals characters to play against is Moon Knight. He flies around the map dropping ankhs that tear you apart the second you step into their radius. And any time a match enters overtime with everyone stacked on the payload, you can bet there will be a Moon Knight somewhere [&#8230;]

## Sniper Elite: Resistance offers a forgettable and formulaic fight against the fascists

date: 2025-01-27, updated: 2025-01-24, from: Polygon Website

There’s an old saying that goes: “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” However, few people know that this is usually followed by another adage: “But if it’s already stale, don’t keep reheating it with an air fryer.” Both statements are true for Sniper Elite: Resistance, the latest installment in Rebellion’s third-person stealth and tactical [&#8230;]

## ‘A thankless job’: Marvel Rivals healers are tired of being overlooked

date: 2025-01-26, updated: 2025-01-24, from: Polygon Website

Healers often get a raw deal in hero shooter games. Classes capable of keeping players alive are critical, and can make the difference between a team that wins and a team that loses.
