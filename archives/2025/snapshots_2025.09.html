LLMs for drafting alt text
</h4>
<p>
I use LLMs for the first draft of my alt text
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoxpEM6TLEU&amp;t=22m10s">22:10</a>):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I actually use Large Language Models for most of my alt text these days.
Whenever I tweet an image or whatever, I‚Äôve got a Claude project called
Alt text writer. It‚Äôs got a prompt and an example. I dump an image in
and it gives me the alt text.
</p>
<p>
I very rarely just use it because that‚Äôs rude, right? You should never
dump text onto people that you haven‚Äôt reviewed yourself. But it‚Äôs
always a good starting point.
</p>
<p>
Normally I‚Äôll edit a tiny little bit. I‚Äôll delete an unimportant detail
or I‚Äôll bulk something up. And then I‚Äôve got alt text that works.
</p>
<p>
Often it‚Äôs actually got really good taste. A great example is if you‚Äôve
got a screenshot of an interface, there‚Äôs a lot of words in that
screenshot and most of them don‚Äôt matter.
</p>
<p>
The message you‚Äôre trying to give in the alt text is that it‚Äôs two
panels on the left, there‚Äôs a conversation on the right, there‚Äôs a
preview of the SVG file or something. My alt text writer normally gets
that right.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs even good at summarizing tables of data where it will notice that
actually what really matters is that Gemini got a score of 57 and Nova
got a score of 53 - so it will pull those details out and ignore
[irrelevant columns] like the release dates and so forth.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here‚Äôs the current custom instructions prompt I‚Äôm using for that Claude
Project:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>You write alt text for any image pasted in by the user. Alt text
is always presented in a fenced code block to make it easy to copy and
paste out. It is always presented on a single line so it can be used
easily in Markdown images. All text on the image (for screenshots etc)
must be exactly included. A short note describing the nature of the
image itself should go first.</code>

<h4 id="ethics">
Is it ethical to build unreliable accessibility tools?
</h4>
<p>
On the ethics of building accessibility tools on top of inherently
unreliable technology
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoxpEM6TLEU&amp;t=5m35s">5:33</a>):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Some people I‚Äôve talked to have been skeptical about the accessibility
benefits because their argument is that if you give somebody unreliable
technology that might hallucinate and make things up, surely that‚Äôs
harming them.
</p>
<p>
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true. I feel like people who use screen readers are
used to unreliable technology.
</p>
<p>
You know, if you use a guide dog - it‚Äôs a wonderful thing and a
<em>very</em> unreliable piece of technology.
</p>
<p>
When you consider that people with accessibility needs have agency, they
can understand the limitations of the technology they‚Äôre using. I feel
like giving them a tool where they can point their phone at something
and it can describe it to them is a world away from accessibility
technology just three or four years ago.
</p>

<h4 id="not-a-threat">
Why I don‚Äôt feel threatened as a software engineer
</h4>
<p>
This is probably my most coherent explanation yet of why I don‚Äôt see
generative AI as a threat to my career as a software engineer
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoxpEM6TLEU&amp;t=33m51s">33:49</a>):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
My perspective on this as a developer who‚Äôs been using these systems on
a daily basis for a couple of years now is that I find that they enhance
my value. I am so much more competent and capable as a developer because
I‚Äôve got these tools assisting me. I can write code in dozens of new
programming languages that I never learned before.
</p>
<p>
But I still get to benefit from my 20 years of experience.
</p>
<p>
Take somebody off the street who‚Äôs never written any code before and ask
them to build an iPhone app with ChatGPT. They are going to run into so
many pitfalls, because programming isn‚Äôt just about can you write code -
it‚Äôs about thinking through the problems, understanding what‚Äôs possible
and what‚Äôs not, understanding how to QA, what good code is, having good
taste.
</p>
<p>
There‚Äôs so much depth to what we do as software engineers.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôve said before that generative AI probably gives me like two to five
times productivity boost on the part of my job that involves typing code
into a laptop. But that‚Äôs only 10 percent of what I do. As a software
engineer, most of my time isn‚Äôt actually spent with the typing of the
code. It‚Äôs all of those other activities.
</p>
<p>
The AI systems help with those other activities, too. They can help me
think through architectural decisions and research library options and
so on. But I still have to have that agency to understand what I‚Äôm
doing.
</p>
<p>
So as a software engineer, I don‚Äôt feel threatened. My most optimistic
view of this is that the cost of developing software goes down because
an engineer like myself can be more ambitious, can take on more things.
As a result, demand for software goes up - because if you‚Äôre a company
that previously would never have dreamed of building a custom CRM for
your industry because it would have taken 20 engineers a year before you
got any results‚Ä¶ If it now takes four engineers three months to get
results, maybe you‚Äôre in the market for software engineers now that you
weren‚Äôt before.

New site by members of 18F, the team within the US government that were
doing some of the most effective work at improving government
efficiency.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
For over 11 years, 18F has been proudly serving you to make government
technology work better. We are non-partisan civil servants. 18F has
worked on hundreds of projects, all designed to make government
technology not just efficient but effective, and to save money for
American taxpayers.

<p>
However, all employees at 18F ‚Äì a group that the Trump Administration
GSA Technology Transformation Services Director called ‚Äúthe gold
standard‚Äù of civic tech ‚Äì were terminated today at midnight ET.

<p>
<strong>18F was doing exactly the type of work that DOGE claims to want
‚Äì yet we were eliminated.</strong>

The entire team is now on ‚Äúadministrative leave‚Äù and locked out of their

But these are not the kind of civil servants to abandon their mission
without a fight:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>We‚Äôre not done yet.</strong>

<p>
We‚Äôre still absorbing what has happened. We‚Äôre wrestling with what it
will mean for ourselves and our families, as well as the impact on our

But we came to the government to fix things. And we‚Äôre not done with
this work yet.

More to come.

<h2
id="hallucinations-in-code-are-the-least-dangerous-form-of-llm-mistakes">Hallucinations
in code are the least dangerous form of LLM mistakes</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-02, updated: 2025-03-02, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs
Weblog</p>
<p>
A surprisingly common complaint I see from developers who have tried
using LLMs for code is that they encountered a hallucination - usually
the LLM inventing a method or even a full software library that doesn‚Äôt
exist - and it crashed their confidence in LLMs as a tool for writing
code. How could anyone productively use these things if they invent
methods that don‚Äôt exist?
</p>
<p>
Hallucinations in code <strong>are the least harmful hallucinations you
can encounter from a model</strong>.
</p>
<p>
The real risk from using LLMs for code is that they‚Äôll make mistakes
that <em>aren‚Äôt</em> instantly caught by the language compiler or
interpreter. And these happen <em>all the time</em>!
</p>
<p>
The moment you run LLM generated code, any hallucinated methods will be
instantly obvious: you‚Äôll get an error. You can fix that yourself or you
can feed the error back into the LLM and watch it correct itself.
</p>
<p>
Compare this to hallucinations in regular prose, where you need a
critical eye, strong intuitions and well developed fact checking skills
to avoid sharing information that‚Äôs incorrect and directly harmful to
your reputation.
</p>
<p>
With code you get a powerful form of fact checking for free. Run the
code, see if it works.
</p>
<p>
In some setups -
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/code-interpreter/">ChatGPT Code
Interpreter</a>,
<a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview">Claude
Code</a>, any of the growing number of ‚Äúagentic‚Äù code systems that write
and then execute code in a loop - the LLM system itself will spot the
error and automatically correct itself.
</p>
<p>
If you‚Äôre using an LLM to write code without even running it yourself,
<em>what are you doing?</em>
</p>
<p>
Hallucinated methods are such a tiny roadblock that when people complain
about them I assume they‚Äôve spent minimal time learning how to
effectively use these systems - they dropped them at the first hurdle.
</p>
<p>
My cynical side suspects they may have been looking for a reason to
dismiss the technology and jumped at the first one they found.
</p>
<p>
My less cynical side assumes that nobody ever warned them that you have
to put a lot of work in to learn how to get good results out of these
systems. I‚Äôve been exploring
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming/">their
applications for writing code</a> for over two years now and I‚Äôm still
learning new tricks (and new strengths and weaknesses) almost every day.
</p>
<h4 id="qa">
Manually testing code is essential
</h4>
<p>
Just because code looks good and runs without errors doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs
actually doing the right thing. No amount of meticulous code review - or
even comprehensive automated tests - will demonstrably prove that code
actually does the right thing. You have to run it yourself!
</p>
<p>
Proving to yourself that the code works is your job. This is one of the
many reasons I don‚Äôt think LLMs are going to put software professionals
out of work.
</p>
<p>
LLM code will usually look fantastic: good variable names, convincing
comments, clear type annotations and a logical structure. This can lull
you into a false sense of security, in the same way that a gramatically
correct and confident answer from ChatGPT might tempt you to skip fact
checking or applying a skeptical eye.
</p>
<p>
The way to avoid <em>those</em> problems is the same as how you avoid
problems in code by other humans that you are reviewing, or code that
you‚Äôve written yourself: you need to actively exercise that code. You
need to have great manual QA skills.
</p>
<p>
A general rule for programming is that you should <em>never</em> trust
any piece of code until you‚Äôve seen it work with your own eye - or, even
better, seen it fail and then fixed it.
</p>
<p>
Across my entire career, almost every time I‚Äôve assumed some code works
without actively executing it - some branch condition that rarely gets
hit, or an error message that I don‚Äôt expect to occur - I‚Äôve later come
to regret that assumption.
</p>
<h4 id="tips">
Tips for reducing hallucinations
</h4>
<p>
If you really are seeing a deluge of hallucinated details in the code
LLMs are producing for you, there are a bunch of things you can do about
it.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Try different models. It might be that another model has better training
data for your chosen platform. As a Python and JavaScript programmer my
favorite models right now are Claude 3.7 Sonnet with thinking turned on,
OpenAI‚Äôs o3-mini-high and GPT-4o with Code Interpreter (for Python).
</li>
<li>
Learn how to use the context. If an LLM doesn‚Äôt know a particular
library you can often fix this by dumping in a few dozen lines of
example code. LLMs are incredibly good at imitating things, and at
rapidly picking up patterns from very limited examples. Modern model‚Äôs
have increasingly large context windows - I‚Äôve recently started using
Claude‚Äôs new
<a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/10167454-using-the-github-integration">GitHub
integration</a> to dump entire repositories into the context and it‚Äôs
been working extremely well for me.

Chose <a href="https://boringtechnology.club/">boring technology</a>. I
genuinely find myself picking libraries that have been around for a
while partly because that way it‚Äôs much more likely that LLMs will be
able to use them.

</ul>
<p>
I‚Äôll finish this rant with a related observation: I keep seeing people
say ‚Äúif I have to review every line of code an LLM writes, it would have
been faster to write it myself!‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Those people are loudly declaring that they have under-invested in the
crucial skills of reading, understanding and reviewing code written by
other people. I suggest getting some more practice in. Reviewing code
written for you by LLMs is a great way to do that.

<em>Bonus section</em>: I asked Claude 3.7 Sonnet ‚Äúextended thinking
mode‚Äù to review an earlier draft of this post - ‚Äú<code>Review my rant of
a blog entry. I want to know if the argument is convincing, small
changes I can make to improve it, if there are things I‚Äôve
missed.</code>‚Äù. It was quite helpful, especially in providing tips to
make that first draft a little less confrontational! Since you can share
Claude chats now
