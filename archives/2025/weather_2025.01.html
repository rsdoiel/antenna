Mesoscale Discussion 0023
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0726 AM CST Thu Jan 09 2025

Areas affected...far east-central New Mexico...much of the TX
Panhandle...and southwest and south-central Oklahoma.

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 091326Z - 091630Z

SUMMARY...1+ inch per hour snowfall rates expected this morning.

DISCUSSION...Moderate snowfall has expanded across the Texas
Panhandle and southern Oklahoma. As the boundary layer continues to
moisten and isentropic ascent maximizes this morning, expect heavy
snow with rates of 1 inch per hour from far eastern New Mexico to
south-central Oklahoma. The heaviest rates are expected from 14Z to
17Z. Some locally higher rates, perhaps approaching 1.5 inches per
hour, are possible across parts of the southern Texas Panhandle
where a deeper dendritic growth zone and elevated convective
instability (185 J/kg MUCAPE on the 12Z AMA RAOB) are present. After
17Z, snowfall rates will likely weaken across the entire region amid
veering/weakening 850-700mb flow.

Mesoscale Discussion 0022
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0642 AM CST Thu Jan 09 2025

Areas affected...West Texas into north central Texas and southern
Oklahoma.

Concerning...Winter mixed precipitation 

Valid 091242Z - 091515Z

SUMMARY...A mix of snow, freezing rain and occasional sleet is
expanding from West Texas to the Red River.

DISCUSSION...A precipitation shield has expanded across West Texas,
the Texas Panhandle, and southern Oklahoma as isentropic ascent
strengthens ahead of an approaching mid-level trough. Many
observation sites across West Texas have observed freezing rain this
morning with relatively light accumulation. However, as
precipitation intensifies, isolated greater accumulation amounts
have been observed (KABI reported 0.14 inches of ice accretion
between 11Z and 12Z), with this likely continuing through the
morning. While some mixed phase precipitation may occur this morning
while the boundary layer is moistening across Oklahoma and North
Texas, expect mostly snow across this region by mid-morning given
the thermal profile from the KOUN 12Z RAOB. Farther south, expect
freezing rain to persist this morning before temperatures should
rise above freezing by late morning as low-level flow/warm air
advection strengthens.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0658 AM CST Thu Jan 09 2025

Valid 091300Z - 101200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not forecast through tonight.

...Discussion...
A low-latitude positive-tilt upper trough over the Four Corners and
northwest Mexico will slowly transition eastward toward the southern
High Plains through tonight. A related strengthening of deep-layer
southwesterly winds will occur across the southern Plains, atop a
cool and stable air mass at the surface. Warm advection and elevated
moisture transport will be maximized across broad parts of
central/southern to east Texas today, and into the Lower Mississippi
Valley tonight. Weak elevated buoyancy will support occasional
thunderstorms. It is unlikely that instability will be strong enough
for any hail risk given poor lapse rates aloft.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0203 AM CST Thu Jan 09 2025

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough in the Northwest will shift south and east on
Friday. This feature is expected to lose amplitude as an upstream
trough moves into the Northwest. As a result, surface high pressure
in the Great Basin/Southwest should lose intensity rather quickly
after the early morning hours.

...Southern California...
The offshore pressure gradient will have been in the process of
gradually weakening for several hours prior to Friday morning. The
weakening trend will continue, especially during the afternoon.
Upper-level wind support will also quickly dissipate after the early
morning as the trough pushes farther east and upper-level ridging
increases in the region. RH will likely remain low through the day.
5-20% RH will be fairly widespread by the afternoon. Winds will
generally reach 15-25 mph. Some locally higher speeds are possible
within the terrain. Given the overall large-scale trends and
high-resolution ensemble guidance, critical fire weather conditions
are expected to occur locally and primarily tied to terrain
features.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0338 PM CST Wed Jan 08 2025

Valid 101200Z - 161200Z

Fire weather concerns are expected to remain confined to the
southern CA coast through the extended period where dry, and at
times windy, conditions are expected to continue for the next week.
Elsewhere across the country, a combination of recent precipitation,
rain/snow chances, and cold temperatures should limit additional
fire concerns. 

...D3/Fri and D6/Mon to D7/Tue - Southern California Coast...
Moderate easterly low to mid-level winds are expected to persist
from late D2/Thursday into early D3/Friday morning across far
southern CA as an upper shortwave trough slowly translates
east/southeast. 15-25 mph winds will likely be ongoing along the
western slopes of the coastal terrain at the start of the forecast
period. The ongoing offshore wind event has established a very dry
air mass along the southern CA coast that is expected to persist
through Friday. While winds are expected to diminish through the
day, a few hours of elevated to critical fire weather conditions
appear possible during the morning hours. 

Long-range ensemble guidance continues to show the passage of an
upper-level shortwave trough along the West Coast with a building
surface high over the northern Great Basin during the D6/Mon to
D7/Tues period. This synoptic regime is characteristic of previous
critical fire patterns for the southern CA coast, and the signal for
this regime has been fairly consistent in sequential model runs and
among various deterministic/ensemble solutions. Confidence in
forecast details remains very low at this range due to considerable
spread regarding the evolution and intensity of the upper wave,
though the general consensus appears to be that mid/upper-level
winds for the Mon/Tue system will not be as strong compared to the
ongoing offshore flow event. This perhaps signals a less intense
offshore flow event overall, though critical LAX-TPH pressure
gradient thresholds may be met based on ensemble probabilities.
Given the persistent signal and notable fire activity across the Los
Angeles region, 40% risk areas have been introduced for D6/Mon and
D7/Tue when the offshore flow regime should become established.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected, but very isolated
thunderstorms are possible late tonight across parts of west Texas.

No changes are needed to the current D1 Convective Outlook. See
previous discussion below for more information.

..Thornton/Smtih.. 01/08/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1023 AM CST Wed Jan 08 2025/

...Discussion...
A deep midlevel cyclone will move east-southeastward across
northwest Mexico through the period. Modest midlevel height falls
preceding this feature, combined with weak warm advection, will
support an increase in precipitation across portions of west TX
during the overnight and morning hours. Gradual low/midlevel
moistening amid steep midlevel lapse rates (see 12Z observed DRT
sounding) will yield weak elevated buoyancy atop a sub-freezing
boundary layer. As a result, embedded convective elements will be
capable of isolated lightning flashes.

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not forecast through Friday night.

...Central to eastern Gulf Coast...
Thunder potential appears quite limited on Friday as poor to weak
mid-level lapse rates persist downstream of a positive-tilt longwave
trough. Buoyancy inland appears negligible, but meager MUCAPE over
the north-central Gulf may be sufficient for a thin, low-topped
convective line to shift east through the day from coastal southeast
LA through the FL Panhandle. Surface dew points may reach the mid
60s near the mouth of the MS River, and into the low 60s elsewhere
along the coast near the cyclone track. This could be adequate for
strong gusts mixing to the surface given fast flow aloft. Will
maintain a thunder area to highlight this potential despite the
expectation of minimal prospects for charge separation.

Mesoscale Discussion 0008
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0756 AM CST Sun Jan 05 2025

Areas affected...southeast Kansas...much of southern Missouri...far
southern Illinois and western Kentucky

Concerning...Winter mixed precipitation 

Valid 051356Z - 051800Z

SUMMARY...A combination of snow, sleet, and freezing rain will
become mostly rain by late morning.

DISCUSSION...13Z surface analysis shows a 1004 mb surface low in
eastern Oklahoma with strong high pressure across the northern
Plains and Great Lakes region. Northeasterly surface winds resulting
from this pressure gradient continue to supply low-level arctic air
to areas north of the warm front from Kansas to the Lower Ohio
Valley. Strong 850mb warm air advection has resulted in a thermal
profile favorable for freezing rain across a broad region from
southeast Kansas and across much of southern Missouri early this
morning. The 0C 850mb line will continue to slowly shift north as
strong warm air advection occurs ahead of the surface cyclone. This
will result in snow changing to freezing rain in the next few hours
across parts of southern Illinois and western Kentucky. Areas across
southern Missouri where temperatures are currently near freezing
will likely rise above freezing this morning and bring an end to the
freezing rain threat. However, for much of the area currently
observing freezing rain, the threat will persist through at least
midday.

Areas affected...east-central Missouri...parts of southern
Illinois...southern Indiana...and parts of central Kentucky.

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 051327Z - 051730Z

SUMMARY...1+ inch per hour snowfall rates are expected this morning.

DISCUSSION...Light to  moderate snowfall has developed within a
swath from central Missouri to central Kentucky this morning with a
few heavy snow observations appearing recently in southern Illinois
and southern Indiana. Expect moderate to heavy snow in a relatively
narrow corridor north of the freezing rain from east-central
Missouri to parts of central Kentucky. In addition to the radar
depiction and surface observations indicating heavy snow, the 12Z
HRRR shows a swath of significant accumulation between 13Z and 17Z.
By midday much of this area will switch to freezing rain with the
heavy snow swath shifted farther north during the afternoon as warm
air advection strengthens ahead of the approaching surface low.

Mesoscale Discussion 0006
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0651 AM CST Sun Jan 05 2025

Areas affected...northeast Kansas into west-central Missouri

Concerning...Blizzard 

Valid 051251Z - 051715Z

SUMMARY...Snowfall rates and winds are increasing. Blizzard
conditions will develop this morning.

DISCUSSION...Light to moderate snow is now being observed across
most of northeast Kansas and west-central Missouri. Expect further
increase in snowfall intensity through the morning as the
mid-latitude cyclone continues to organize. Snowfall rates over 2
inches per hour are possible with 40 to 50% probabilities indicated
by the HREF. In addition, winds are expected to increase further as
strong high pressure builds into the northern Plains. The resulting
pressure gradient will lead to sustained winds of 25 to 30 mph and
gusts over 40 mph for much of the day. This will result in
significant blowing and drifting and visibility restrictions.
Blizzard/near-blizzard conditions are likely along the I-70 corridor
from central Kansas to west-central Missouri through most of the day
today.

Mesoscale Discussion 0005
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0439 AM CST Sun Jan 05 2025

Areas affected...portions of southwest and south-central Kansas.

Concerning...Blizzard 

Valid 051039Z - 051545Z

SUMMARY...Blizzard conditions developing.

DISCUSSION...A deformation band has started to organize across
southwest Kansas and the OK/northern TX Panhandles. As this rotates
eastward, heavy snow with 1+ inch per hour rates are expected. In
addition, strong winds are already present (sustained 31 mph at KGBD
on the 956Z observation) and are expected to strengthen further over
the next 3 to 6 hours. Temperatures are in the mid teens which
should result in less dense snow and accentuate visibility
reductions amid strong winds. This will likely result in some
blizzard conditions across parts of southwest and south-central
Kansas through the morning. 

Freezing rain is falling across eastern portions of the MD area
where warmer mid-level air has advected west to the north of the
surface low. However, expect these areas to transition to snow after
13-14Z once the surface low moves farther east.
