Bacteriology, pathogenesis, epidemiology and role of the metallophores
in virulence: a review</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Brucellosis is a recognized zoonotic disease caused by various
Brucella species with significant economic and animal welfare
ramifications worldwide. The spread of brucellosis from domestic
livestock and wild animals, as well as its emergence in new regions,
present novel epidemiological challenges. The consumption of
unpasteurized milk and dairy products from unsanitary farms in endemic
areas poses a serious risk to public health from brucellosis.
Determining the accurate prevalence of brucellosis, particularly in
regions with persistently high prevalence, basically requires careful
and frequent surveillance. Furthermore, transmission and detection of
the illness in non-endemic areas have become more complex due to global
human and animal migration as well as the trade in animal products. This
review presents an updated understanding of brucellosis, covering its
classification and taxonomy, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment
approaches, epidemiology, available control and prevention measures,
antimicrobial resistance and the role of metal uptake in bacterial
virulence. It highlights the consequences of brucellosis for global
health and underscores the need for continuous research, knowledge
sharing, and interdisciplinary cooperation for effective disease control
and prevention.</p>

id="the-role-of-ratio-markers-based-on-prealbumin-in-the-diagnosis-of-periprosthetic-joint-infection">The
role of ratio markers based on prealbumin in the diagnosis of
periprosthetic joint infection</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundPeriprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a severe
complication following total joint arthroplasty, and the timeliness of
its diagnosis and treatment is crucial for patient recovery. Although
various biomarkers have been extensively evaluated and applied in
clinical practice, the diagnosis of PJI remains challenging. Therefore,
it is necessary to identify more precise biomarkers for the diagnosis of
PJI. This study aims to investigate the value of ratio-based biomarkers
using prealbumin (PA) for the diagnosis of PJI.MethodsThis study
compared the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (ESR), fibrinogen (FIB), PA, CRP/PA (CPR), ESR/PA
(EPR), FIB/PA (FPR), and the combined ratio of CPR+EPR+FPR(CEF) in 180
patients with PJI and 105 patients with aseptic loosening (AL) who
presented at our department from January 2019 to December 2024. The
diagnostic efficacy of these markers in PJI diagnosis was assessed using
the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve.ResultsAmong these biomarkers, CPR has the highest AUC of
0.921 (95%CI 0.890-0.952), and it can distinguish PJI with a cut-off
value of 0.0366, a sensitivity of 76.1%, and a specificity of 95.2%. In
the diabetic subgroup, the combined biomarker CEF has an AUC of 0.951
for diagnosing PJI, with a sensitivity of 88.9% and a specificity of
94.4%.ConclusionRatio-based markers based on PA show promise as valuable
new adjunctive diagnostic markers for PJI.</p>

rhamnosus D3189 modulates antiviral and inflammatory responses in
primary nasal epithelial cells, reducing respiratory syncytial virus
shedding</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in the upper
respiratory tract promotes disease progression and transmission, with
excessive inflammation contributing to severe lower respiratory tract
involvement. This study investigates the immunomodulatory effects of
Lactobacillus rhamnosus D3189 on viral kinetics and innate immune
responses in well-differentiated nasal epithelial cells
(WD-NECs).MethodsWD-NECs from healthy adult donors (N = 8) were cultured
in vitro, treated with L. rhamnosus D3189, and then infected with RSV
(strain RS4) 24 hours later. Viral replication and shedding were
assessed via RT-qPCR and plaque assays. Cytotoxicity and epithelial
integrity were evaluated using LDH release and transepithelial
electrical resistance (TEER). Inflammatory and antiviral responses were
investigated using multiplex immunoassays, AlphaLISA, and
ELISA.ResultsRSV infection induced robust viral replication and
shedding, disrupted epithelial barrier integrity, and triggered the
release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I/III interferons. L.
rhamnosus D3189 alone did not induce cytotoxicity or inflammation. While
it had no effect on viral replication, TEER, LDH release, or IFN-λ1/3
levels, D3189 significantly enhanced IFN-β production, reduced viral
shedding, and attenuated RSV-induced cytokine and chemokine
responses.DiscussionL. rhamnosus D3189 modulates the epithelial immune
response to RSV, reducing inflammation and viral shedding without
compromising epithelial integrity. These findings support its potential
as a novel strategy to limit RSV-associated infection and
transmission.</p>

deficiency of chymase mast cell protease 4 exacerbates dextran sulfate
sodium salt-induced colitis in mice and is associated with altered
microbiota and metabolome profiles</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionUlcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic gastrointestinal
disease characterized by symptoms of abdominal pain and diarrhea.
Chymase is a serine protease released by the mast cells and is highly
expressed in patients with UC. However, its role in disease pathogenesis
remains poorly understood. In mice, mast cell protease-4 (MCP-4) is
considered as the functional homolog of human chymase, sharing similar
enzymatic activity and biological roles.MethodsTo investigate the role
of MCP-4 in UC, we induced colitis in Mcpt-4-deficient (Mcpt-4∆Cre) and
littermate control (Mcpt-4fl/fl) mice using 2% dextran sulfate sodium
salt (DSS) for 8 days followed by 2 days of water. After sacrifice,
colon length was measured, and tissue samples were analyzed by histology
(H&amp;E and toluidine blue staining), qPCR, and protein assays. Colonic
contents were collected for microbiota and metabolomics
analysis.ResultsThe results show that the Mcpt-4-deficiency exacerbated
colitis, as reflected by the significantly greater weight loss, higher
histological scores, elevated levels of myeloperoxidase and most of
determined cytokines. Furthermore, the Mcpt-4∆Cre colitis mice displayed
a distinct shift in colonic microbiota composition, notably with
significantly increased abundance of bacteria (Akkermansia and
Turicibacter), associated with potentially worsened inflammation in
colitis models. In addition, metabolomic profiling revealed alterations
in colonic metabolites involved in key Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG) pathways, including NF-kappa B signaling, Th1 and Th2
cell differentiation.DiscussionThese findings reveal that the mouse
chymase MCPT-4 plays important roles in maintaining the intestinal
homeostasis during colitis, potentially through regulation of colonic
cytokines, microbial and metabolic networks.</p>

id="the-cgas-sting-signaling-pathway-in-the-regulation-of-pulmonary-infections-a-systematic-review">The
cGAS-STING signaling pathway in the regulation of pulmonary infections:
a systematic review</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The lungs are constantly exposed to airborne pathogens and depend on
robust innate immune surveillance for protection. The cyclic GMP–AMP
synthase (cGAS)–stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling
pathway, a core component of the innate immune system, plays a pivotal
role in defending against respiratory infections caused by viruses,
bacteria, and mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Dysregulation of this pathway has been linked to several chronic lung
diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and asthma. Upon sensing
cytoplasmic DNA, cGAS activates the STING pathway, producing type I
interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines that drive host immune
response. However, many pathogens have developed strategies to evade
detection or surpass cGAS-STING signaling. This systematic review
highlights the molecular mechanisms governing cGAS-STING activation, its
interaction with lung pathogens, and its potential as a therapeutic
agent in respiratory diseases.</p>

protein biomarkers of Plasmodium falciparum infection in pregnant women:
a high-throughput proteomics study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionPregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa face heightened
susceptibility to Plasmodium falciparum malaria, with placental
sequestration driving adverse outcomes. The infection may lead to
pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) because of the sequestration of
Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes in the placental
intervillous space. Although there are several tools for diagnosing
malaria infection during pregnancy, including blood smear microscopic
examination, rapid diagnostic tests, and PCR, there are no tools for
detecting placental infection and, by extension, any dysfunction
associated with PAM. Thus, PAM, specifically placental infection, can
only be confirmed via postnatal placental histopathology. Therefore,
there is an urgent need for specific plasma biomarkers of
PAM.MethodsHere, we used the high throughput proximity extension assay
to screen plasma from malaria-exposed pregnant women for differentially
expressed proteins that may serve as candidate biomarkers of Plasmodium
falciparum infection during pregnancy, with future potential to inform
diagnosis of PAM or adverse malaria outcomes. Such biomarkers may also
elucidate the pathophysiology of PAM.ResultsUsing proximity extension
assay (PEA), we identified elevated IgG Fc receptor IIb (FCGR2B) and
heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in malaria-positive pregnancies, while neurturin
(NRTN) and IL-20 were downregulated.DiscussionIL-20 emerged as a top
candidate biomarker, warranting validation in large cohorts with
placental histopathology.</p>

of free provision of disinfectant wipes combined with bundle management
on the prevention of multi-drug resistant organism infections in the
respiratory and intensive care unit</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveTo explore the role of free provision of disinfectant wipes
combined with bundle management in preventing Multi-Drug Resistant
Organism (MDRO) infections in the Respiratory and Intensive Care Unit
(RICU).MethodsThis study included patients admitted to the RICU between
January 2022 and June 2023 (control group) and from July 2023 to June
2024 (intervention group), all of whom met the inclusion criteria. The
control group received standard bundle management measures, while the
intervention group received unlimited use of disinfectant wipes combined
with bundle management. The MDRO discovery rates and hospital-acquired
infection incidence rates were compared between the two groups to assess
the impact of free disinfectant wipe provision on MDRO infection
prevention in the RICU.ResultsThere were no significant differences
between the two groups in terms of patient age and baseline
characteristics, except for Sex and the proportion of patients with
chronic respiratory diseases. Notably, the MDRO discovery rate, MDRO
infection rate, and hospital-acquired infection incidence were all
significantly lower in the intervention group compared to the control
group (MDRO discovery rate: 35.2% vs 45.9%, P&lt;0.001; MDRO infection
rate: 0.8% vs 3.5%, P = 0.003; hospital-acquired infection rate: 1.5% vs
3.52%, P=0.030). However, the intervention group had more percentage of
patients receiving mechanical ventilation and longer ICU stay (P &lt;
0.05). Furthermore, in-hospital mortality was lower in the intervention
group (19.5% vs 13.5%, P &lt; 0.05).ConclusionThe combined intervention
of unlimited use of disinfectant wipes with bundle management
significantly reduced MDRO hospital-acquired infection rates and
in-hospital mortality in the RICU, demonstrating its effectiveness in
infection prevention.</p>

host genes influencing Clostridioides difficile infection and the
potential role of intestinal Lactobacillus acidophilus: a Mendelian
randomization and animal model study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionClostridioides difficile infection (CDI) poses a
significant clinical burden due to its high recurrence rate and
life-threatening complications. While gut dysbiosis is central to CDI
pathogenesis, mechanisms underlying microbiota-mediated host defense
remain underexplored.MethodsThis study integrated summary-data-based
Mendelian randomization (SMR) of cis-expression quantitative trait loci
(cis-eQTLs) from blood, transverse colon, and sigmoid colon tissues with
CDI genome-wide association study (GWAS) data to identify host genes
influencing CDI susceptibility. Bayesian co-localization was employed to
validate relationships. Then a germ-free (GF) mice model colonized with
Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) was used to investigate LA-mediated
regulation of possible gene expression and phenotypic changes in the
host.ResultsSMR analysis identified 14 genes associated with CDI risk,
primarily clustered in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
region. Notably, THOC5 exhibited robust associations (PSMR &lt; 0.05 in
all tissues) and co-localization evidence (posterior probability =
82.6%). In GF mice, LA colonization significantly upregulated colonic
Thoc5 expression in two independent experiments (fold change =
5.19/5.00, P = 0.034/0.031). Subsequent immunofluorescence experiments
revealed that LA colonisation enhanced macrophage activation in the
colonic tissue.DiscussionThese findings reveal key host genes,
particularly THOC5, that influence susceptibility to CDI, providing new
targets for future prevention and treatment research. Additionally, the
study suggests a potential mechanism by which host intestinal LA
protects against CDI, highlighting the interaction between probiotics
and host transcriptional networks in CDI resistance. These insights
offer valuable directions for further investigation.</p>

and validation of a multidimensional predictive model for 28-day
mortality in ICU patients with bloodstream infections: a cohort
study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundBloodstream infections (BSI) are a leading cause of sepsis
and death in intensive care unit (ICU). Traditional severity scores,
including the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), Acute
Physiology Score III (APSIII), and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II
(SAPS II), exhibit limitations in effectively predicting mortality among
BSI patients, primarily due to their reliance on a narrow range of
clinical variables. This study aimed to develop and validate a
comprehensive nomogram model for 28-day all-cause mortality prediction
in BSI patients.MethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted using
data from 3,615 patients with positive blood cultures from the MIMIC-IV
database, divided into training (n=2,532) and validation (n=1,083)
cohorts. Through a two-step variable selection process combining LASSO
regression and Boruta algorithm, we identified 12 predictive variables
from 58 initial clinical parameters. The model’s performance was
evaluated using AUROC, net reclassification improvement (NRI),
integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), and decision curve analysis
(DCA).ResultsThe nomogram demonstrated superior discrimination (AUROC:
0.760 vs. 0.671, P&lt;0.001 for SOFA; 0.760 vs. 0.705, P&lt;0.001 for
APSIII; 0.760 vs. 0.707, P&lt;0.001 for SAPS II) in the training cohort,
with consistent performance in the validation cohort (AUROC: 0.742). Key
predictors identified in our model included the need for mechanical
ventilation, the presence of malignancy, platelet count, and scores on
the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). The model showed significant improvements
in NRI and IDI, with consistent net benefit across a wide range of
threshold probabilities in DCA.ConclusionsThis study developed and
validated a predictive model for 28-day mortality in BSI patients that
demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional severity
scores. By integrating clinical, laboratory, and treatment-related
variables, the model provides a more comprehensive approach to risk
stratification. These findings highlight its potential for improving
early identification of high-risk patients and guiding clinical
decision-making, though further prospective validation is needed to
confirm its generalizability.</p>

microbiome-biophysical association: a first integrative approach to
classifying Korean skin types and aging groups</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe field of human microbiome research is rapidly
expanding beyond the gut and into the facial skin care industry.
However, there is still no established criterion to define the objective
relationship between the microbiome and clinical trials for developing
personalized skin solutions that consider individual
diversity.ObjectivesIn this study, we conducted an integrated analysis
of skin measurements, clinical Baumann skin type indicator (BSTI)
surveys, and the skin microbiome of 950 Korean subjects to examine the
ideal skin microbiome-biophysical associations.MethodsBy utilizing four
skin biophysical parameters, we identified four distinct Korean Skin
Cutotypes (KSCs) and categorized the subjects into three aging groups:
the Young (under 34 years old), the Aging I group (35-50), and the Old
group (over 51). To unravel the intricate connection between the skin’s
microbiome and KSC types, we conducted DivCom clustering
analysis.ResultsThis endeavor successfully classified 726 out of 740
female skin microbiomes into three subclusters: DC1-sub1, DC1-sub2, and
DC2 with 15 core genera. To further amplify our findings, we harnessed
the potent capabilities of the CatBoost boosting algorithm and achieved
a reliable framework for predicting skin types based on microbial
composition with an impressive average accuracy of 0.96 AUC value. Our
study conclusively demonstrated that these 15 core genera could serve as
objective indicators, differentiating the microbial composition among
the aging groups.ConclusionIn conclusion, this study sheds light on the
complex relationship between the skin microbiome and biophysical
properties, and the findings provide a promising approach to advance the
field of skincare, cosmetics, and broader microbial research.</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundBorrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii are the leading
causes of Lyme borreliosis (LB) in Europe. Persistent LB forms may
involve biofilms, potentially contributing to antibiotic
tolerance.MethodsWhole genome sequencing (WGS) was conducted on 7 B.
afzelii and 5 B. garinii isolates from erythema migrans skin biopsies.
Biofilms were analyzed for extracellular DNA (eDNA) content and biomass.
A phenol red metabolic assay assessed the minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) and minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC)
of amoxicillin, azithromycin, ceftriaxone, and
doxycycline.ResultsPhylogenetic analysis revealed B. afzelii and B.
garinii formed distinct clades, while B. burgdorferi B31 clustered
separately. Core genome analysis showed 38.9% of genes were shared
between B. afzelii and B. garinii, decreasing to 26.1% with B.
burgdorferi. The cloud genome expanded from 34.4% to 53.4% with the
addition of B. burgdorferi. No antimicrobial resistance genes were
detected. Surface adhesion gene profiles exhibited significant variation
across species, suggesting potential functional differences in host
adaptation. B. afzelii and B. garinii species exhibited biofilms, with
biomass correlating significantly with eDNA production. MIC values were
0.25 μg/mL (amoxicillin, ceftriaxone), 0.125 μg/mL (azithromycin), and
0.5 μg/mL (doxycycline), with no significant interspecies differences.
However, MBIC values were considerably higher: 2 μg/mL (amoxicillin,
azithromycin), 16 μg/mL (ceftriaxone), and 32 μg/mL
(doxycycline).ConclusionsBiofilms in B. afzelii and B. garinii
significantly reduce antibiotic efficacy, particularly ceftriaxone and
doxycycline. These in vitro findings highlight the need for targeted
therapeutic strategies and suggest biofilms may impact treatment
outcomes in LB.</p>

potential links between gut microbiome, clinical parameters, and
mortality in long-living male patients receiving multi-drug therapy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Background and aimsMultimorbidity and polypharmacy are common in
long-living patients and have been linked to alterations in gut
microbiota. However, the prognostic relevance of these microbiota
changes remains unclear in this population. We hypothesized that
clinical parameters and gut microbial profiles are associated with
survival outcomes. This exploratory study aimed to investigate the
relationships between intestinal microbiota, clinical variables, and
18-month mortality in long-living male patients undergoing multi-drug
therapy.Methods33 long-living male adults (mean age 94 ± 4 years) were
enrolled. Upon admission, clinical parameters and stool samples were
collected. The composition of intestinal microbiome was examined using
16S rRNA gene sequencing technology. Subsequently, the patients were
categorized into death and no-death groups based on their survival
status after 18 months. Risk factors associated with 18-month mortality
in patients were evaluated.ResultsThe 18-month mortality rate was 48.5%.
In this exploratory analysis, higher CIRS-G scores and creatinine levels
were independently associated with mortality (HR: 1.323 and 1.007,
respectively). CIRS-G had high prognostic value (AUC = 0.967). IL-6
levels and renal/hepatic/pancreatic comorbidities were also elevated in
the death group. Notably, Erysipelatoclostridium was enriched in
survivors and Sutterella in non-survivors, with correlations to clinical
parameters.ConclusionsCIRS-G scores and serum creatinine levels
demonstrated potential predictability for prognostic value in
forecasting mortality among long-living male patients. Moreover, a
potential association between CIRS-G score and intestinal microbiome was
observed. These results underscore the intricate impact of comorbidities
and polypharmacy on intestinal microbiome composition and clinical
consequences. Clinically, the CIRS-G score could serve as a valuable
tool for identifying high-risk elderly patients who may benefit from
closer monitoring and individualized interventions. However, the small
sample size, monocentric design, and potential confounders limit
generalizability. These findings support further validation in larger
cohorts.</p>

of gut microbiota on endometriosis: linking physical injury to mental
health</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Endometriosis is widely recognized as a chronic, inflammatory, and
heterogeneous condition that can manifest in various anatomical
locations within females. It is marked by estrogen-driven cycles of
bleeding, cell proliferation, and fibrosis involving ectopic endometrial
glands and stroma cells located outside the uterus. The limited
understanding of its etiology and complex pathogenesis has created
obstacles in achieving early diagnosis and developing effective
treatments with minimal side effects. Consequently, endometriosis
requires more in-depth research to unravel its pathogenesis. The gut
microbiota, a key player in chronic diseases, significantly influences
bodily metabolism and immune regulation. Emerging evidence links the gut
microbiota to inflammation, estrogen metabolism, and immune
responses—key factors in the onset and progression of endometriosis.
This review examines the various mechanisms through which endometriosis
and the gut microbiota interact, aiming to inspire new strategies for
preventing and early treating endometriosis.</p>

impact of Helicobacter pylori infection and eradication therapies on gut
microbiota: a systematic review of microbial dysbiosis and its
implications in gastric carcinogenesis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundHelicobacter pylori is a globally prevalent bacterium
associated with several gastrointestinal diseases, including peptic
ulcers and gastric cancer. Growing interest has emerged in understanding
how H. pylori affects gut microbiota and whether eradication therapies
impact microbial balance, potentially influencing disease outcomes,
including cancer progression.MethodsA systematic review was conducted
across PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases using predefined
keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. Quality assessment
was performed using the MINORS and Jadad scales.ResultsA total of 45
studies met the inclusion criteria, which evaluated microbial changes in
H. pylori -infected individuals before and after eradication therapies.
H. pylori infection resulted in significant alterations in gut and
gastric microbiota, with a notable increase in inflammation-associated
bacteria, such as Proteobacteria and Streptococcus. In gastric cancer
patients, microbial diversity was reduced, with decreased levels of
Bifidobacterium and Actinobacteria, and increased levels of Prevotella
and Dialister, both associated with pro-inflammatory environments.
Eradication therapies generally worsened dysbiosis initially, but
probiotic supplementation promoted faster recovery of beneficial
bacteria, improving microbial balance and reducing cancer-related
dysbiosis.ConclusionH. pylori infection disrupts the gut microbiota,
with eradication therapies further altering microbial composition. The
restoration of microbial diversity is improved by probiotic
supplementation. Understanding the long-term impacts of these therapies
on gut health is essential for refining treatment strategies,
particularly in preventing H. pylori -associated diseases like gastric
cancer.</p>

id="innate-immune-role-of-il-6-in-influenza-a-virus-pathogenesis">Innate
immune role of IL-6 in influenza a virus pathogenesis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pleiotropic cytokine, is induced by infection
of influenza A virus (IAV), where it plays a pivotal role in immune
defense and the regulation of inflammation. IAV induces IL-6
transcription upon recognition by pattern recognition receptors, which
activate downstream signaling cascades, leading to the activation of
transcription factors. Activated transcription factors subsequently
regulate the expression of IL-6 in innate immune cells, such as
macrophages, dendritic cells, and epithelial cells. IL-6 contributes to
antiviral immunity by promoting the recruitment of immune cells to sites
of infection and amplifying the inflammatory response. While optimal
IL-6 production is essential for effective anti-IAV immunity, excessive
IL-6 production can contribute to a dysregulated immune response,
leading to a cytokine storm. In this context, IL-6 signaling, in
coordination with other proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and
IL-1β, not only enhances its own production but can also serve as a key
mediator of inflammation. This cascade can result in exaggerated immune
responses, causing tissue damage and potentially leading to severe
outcomes, including organ failure and death. Understanding the molecular
mechanisms underlying cytokine storms presents important therapeutic
opportunities. However, the precise pathways responsible for excessive
IL-6 production and its dysregulation during IAV infection is not fully
understood. This review explores the reported mechanisms regulating IL-6
induction in response to IAV and its innate immune role in IAV
pathogenesis, highlighting existing research gaps in understanding
IAV-induced IL-6 production and its impact on immune modulation. A
deeper understanding of IAV-induced IL-6 production and signaling could
inform the development of targeted therapies to more effectively manage
influenza.</p>

the distinctive characteristics of gut microbiota across different horse
breeds and ages using metataxonomics</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundGut microbiota exerts a pivotal function in host nutrient
metabolism and maturation of the mucosal immunity. Analyzing the
reciprocal interaction between horses and gut microbiota constitutes a
crucial aspect of scientific feeding practices. This study aims to
investigate the differences in gut microbiota among Hequ horses,
Mongolian horses, and Thoroughbred horses, as well as between
Thoroughbred horses at two age stages.Methods and resultsPaired-end
sequencing with a read length of 2×250 bp targeting the V3-V4 region of
the 16S rRNA gene in fecal samples was carried out. Subsequently,
differences in the diversity, composition, and metabolic pathways of the
gut microbiota among the groups were analyzed. The results showed that:
(1) Horse breeds were associated with variations in the gut microbiota.
Microbial diversity, the proportion of commensal bacteria from Bacillota
and Bacteroidota, and bacterial communities involved in dietary fiber
metabolisms were significantly higher in the gut of the Hequ horses than
in the gut of the Mongolian and Thoroughbred horses. The highest
Bacillota to Bacteroidota (B/B) ratio and enrichment of bacterial
communities involved in the metabolism of bile acids, lipids, and amino
acids in the gut of the Mongolian horses resulted in significantly
higher lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism than in the other two
breeds. The bacterial communities enriched in the gut of Thoroughbred
horses were primarily involved in carbohydrate metabolism, but the level
of energy metabolism was significantly lower than in Hequ horses. (2)
The results also showed an association between age and gut microbiota of
Thoroughbred horses. The alpha diversity, B/B ratio, and 83.33% of
metabolic pathways did not differ significantly between younger and
older Thoroughbred horses. However, there were significant differences
between the two age groups in beta diversity, composition of glycolytic
bacteria, metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, and energy metabolism of
gut microbiota.ConclusionsCollectively, these results point to an
association between the breed of horses or the age of Thoroughbred
horses with variations in gut microbiota. The current findings will
serve as a reference for improving feeding strategies for horses.</p>

the bioactive compounds of Carica papaya leaves: phytol’s role in
combatting antibiotic-resistant bacteria</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionAntibiotic resistance is a pressing global challenge,
complicating the treatment of infectious diseases caused by
multidrug-resistant microorganism. For centuries, medicinal plants have
been a cornerstone of natural remedies, offering bioactive compounds
with therapeutic potential.MethodsThe study investigate the
phytochemical screening and antibacterial efficay of Carica papaya leaf
extract, focusing on its impact against three Gram-negative bacterial
pathogens i.e., Escherichia coli, Helicobacter pylori, and Salmonella
enterica serovar Typhi, are major contributors to gastrointestinal
infections worldwide, often leading to severe inflammation and chronic
health complications. ResultsThe phytochemical screening revealed the
presence of phenols and flavonoids, which are key contributors to the
extract’s biological activity. GC-MC analysis identified 27 bioactive
compounds, with phytol emerging as a prominent constituent, detected at
a peak retention time of 18.712 minutes. Antibacterial assays
demonstrated significant efficacy, with inhibitory zones ranging from 10
to 20 mm against the tested pathogens. Molecular docking further
highlighted phytol’s strong binding affinities to crucial bacterial
proteins, including DNA gyrase (E. coli), Vacuolating cytotoxin A (H.
pylori) from, and Dihydrofolate reductase (Salmonella enterica serovar
Typhi). Notably, phytol exhibited the highest binding energy (-6.64
kcal/mol) with DHFR, indicating a robust interaction that underscores
its potential as a targeted antibacterial agent against Salmonella
enterica serovar Typhi.DiscussionThese findings position phytol as a
promising lead compound for developing novel antibacterial therapies.
Its strong activity against multidrug-resistant pathogens suggests
potential for further exploration, though additional research is needed
to assess its role in resistance modulation or prevention.</p>

of gut microbiota in neuroinflammation: a focus on perioperative
neurocognitive disorders</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND), including postoperative
delirium, preoperatively cognitive impairment, postoperative cognitive
dysfunction, and delayed neurocognitive recovery, represent common
complications following anesthesia and surgery, especially in the
elderly. As the global population ages, PND is receiving increasing
attention due to its prolonged the hospitalization, reduced quality of
life and elevated mortality rate. A growing body of evidence has been
suggested that the gut-brain axis, a communication system between the
gut microbiota and the neuroinflammation, plays a critical role in the
development and progression of cognitive impairment. Perioperative
interventions, including anesthesia, surgical stress, result in gut
microbiota dysbiosis and subsequently trigger neuroinflammation.
Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the underlying mechanistic
associations between the gut microbiota and the neuroinflammation during
PND progression. In this review, we synthesize current knowledge on the
mechanistic interplay between gut microbiota dysbiosis and
neuroinflammation in PND pathogenesis, which provide reasonable and
novel therapeutic approaches targeting the gut-brain axis for PND.</p>
