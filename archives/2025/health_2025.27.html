and validation of a multidimensional predictive model for 28-day
mortality in ICU patients with bloodstream infections: a cohort
study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundBloodstream infections (BSI) are a leading cause of sepsis
and death in intensive care unit (ICU). Traditional severity scores,
including the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), Acute
Physiology Score III (APSIII), and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II
(SAPS II), exhibit limitations in effectively predicting mortality among
BSI patients, primarily due to their reliance on a narrow range of
clinical variables. This study aimed to develop and validate a
comprehensive nomogram model for 28-day all-cause mortality prediction
in BSI patients.MethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted using
data from 3,615 patients with positive blood cultures from the MIMIC-IV
database, divided into training (n=2,532) and validation (n=1,083)
cohorts. Through a two-step variable selection process combining LASSO
regression and Boruta algorithm, we identified 12 predictive variables
from 58 initial clinical parameters. The model’s performance was
evaluated using AUROC, net reclassification improvement (NRI),
integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), and decision curve analysis
(DCA).ResultsThe nomogram demonstrated superior discrimination (AUROC:
0.760 vs. 0.671, P&lt;0.001 for SOFA; 0.760 vs. 0.705, P&lt;0.001 for
APSIII; 0.760 vs. 0.707, P&lt;0.001 for SAPS II) in the training cohort,
with consistent performance in the validation cohort (AUROC: 0.742). Key
predictors identified in our model included the need for mechanical
ventilation, the presence of malignancy, platelet count, and scores on
the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). The model showed significant improvements
in NRI and IDI, with consistent net benefit across a wide range of
threshold probabilities in DCA.ConclusionsThis study developed and
validated a predictive model for 28-day mortality in BSI patients that
demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional severity
scores. By integrating clinical, laboratory, and treatment-related
variables, the model provides a more comprehensive approach to risk
stratification. These findings highlight its potential for improving
early identification of high-risk patients and guiding clinical
decision-making, though further prospective validation is needed to
confirm its generalizability.</p>

microbiome-biophysical association: a first integrative approach to
classifying Korean skin types and aging groups</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe field of human microbiome research is rapidly
expanding beyond the gut and into the facial skin care industry.
However, there is still no established criterion to define the objective
relationship between the microbiome and clinical trials for developing
personalized skin solutions that consider individual
diversity.ObjectivesIn this study, we conducted an integrated analysis
of skin measurements, clinical Baumann skin type indicator (BSTI)
surveys, and the skin microbiome of 950 Korean subjects to examine the
ideal skin microbiome-biophysical associations.MethodsBy utilizing four
skin biophysical parameters, we identified four distinct Korean Skin
Cutotypes (KSCs) and categorized the subjects into three aging groups:
the Young (under 34 years old), the Aging I group (35-50), and the Old
group (over 51). To unravel the intricate connection between the skin’s
microbiome and KSC types, we conducted DivCom clustering
analysis.ResultsThis endeavor successfully classified 726 out of 740
female skin microbiomes into three subclusters: DC1-sub1, DC1-sub2, and
DC2 with 15 core genera. To further amplify our findings, we harnessed
the potent capabilities of the CatBoost boosting algorithm and achieved
a reliable framework for predicting skin types based on microbial
composition with an impressive average accuracy of 0.96 AUC value. Our
study conclusively demonstrated that these 15 core genera could serve as
objective indicators, differentiating the microbial composition among
the aging groups.ConclusionIn conclusion, this study sheds light on the
complex relationship between the skin microbiome and biophysical
properties, and the findings provide a promising approach to advance the
field of skincare, cosmetics, and broader microbial research.</p>

characterization and antibiotic susceptibility of biofilm-forming
Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii from patients with erythema
migrans</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundBorrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii are the leading
causes of Lyme borreliosis (LB) in Europe. Persistent LB forms may
involve biofilms, potentially contributing to antibiotic
tolerance.MethodsWhole genome sequencing (WGS) was conducted on 7 B.
afzelii and 5 B. garinii isolates from erythema migrans skin biopsies.
Biofilms were analyzed for extracellular DNA (eDNA) content and biomass.
A phenol red metabolic assay assessed the minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) and minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC)
of amoxicillin, azithromycin, ceftriaxone, and
doxycycline.ResultsPhylogenetic analysis revealed B. afzelii and B.
garinii formed distinct clades, while B. burgdorferi B31 clustered
separately. Core genome analysis showed 38.9% of genes were shared
between B. afzelii and B. garinii, decreasing to 26.1% with B.
burgdorferi. The cloud genome expanded from 34.4% to 53.4% with the
addition of B. burgdorferi. No antimicrobial resistance genes were
detected. Surface adhesion gene profiles exhibited significant variation
across species, suggesting potential functional differences in host
adaptation. B. afzelii and B. garinii species exhibited biofilms, with
biomass correlating significantly with eDNA production. MIC values were
0.25 μg/mL (amoxicillin, ceftriaxone), 0.125 μg/mL (azithromycin), and
0.5 μg/mL (doxycycline), with no significant interspecies differences.
However, MBIC values were considerably higher: 2 μg/mL (amoxicillin,
azithromycin), 16 μg/mL (ceftriaxone), and 32 μg/mL
(doxycycline).ConclusionsBiofilms in B. afzelii and B. garinii
significantly reduce antibiotic efficacy, particularly ceftriaxone and
doxycycline. These in vitro findings highlight the need for targeted
therapeutic strategies and suggest biofilms may impact treatment
outcomes in LB.</p>

potential links between gut microbiome, clinical parameters, and
mortality in long-living male patients receiving multi-drug therapy</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Background and aimsMultimorbidity and polypharmacy are common in
long-living patients and have been linked to alterations in gut
microbiota. However, the prognostic relevance of these microbiota
changes remains unclear in this population. We hypothesized that
clinical parameters and gut microbial profiles are associated with
survival outcomes. This exploratory study aimed to investigate the
relationships between intestinal microbiota, clinical variables, and
18-month mortality in long-living male patients undergoing multi-drug
therapy.Methods33 long-living male adults (mean age 94 ± 4 years) were
enrolled. Upon admission, clinical parameters and stool samples were
collected. The composition of intestinal microbiome was examined using
16S rRNA gene sequencing technology. Subsequently, the patients were
categorized into death and no-death groups based on their survival
status after 18 months. Risk factors associated with 18-month mortality
in patients were evaluated.ResultsThe 18-month mortality rate was 48.5%.
In this exploratory analysis, higher CIRS-G scores and creatinine levels
were independently associated with mortality (HR: 1.323 and 1.007,
respectively). CIRS-G had high prognostic value (AUC = 0.967). IL-6
levels and renal/hepatic/pancreatic comorbidities were also elevated in
the death group. Notably, Erysipelatoclostridium was enriched in
survivors and Sutterella in non-survivors, with correlations to clinical
parameters.ConclusionsCIRS-G scores and serum creatinine levels
demonstrated potential predictability for prognostic value in
forecasting mortality among long-living male patients. Moreover, a
potential association between CIRS-G score and intestinal microbiome was
observed. These results underscore the intricate impact of comorbidities
and polypharmacy on intestinal microbiome composition and clinical
consequences. Clinically, the CIRS-G score could serve as a valuable
tool for identifying high-risk elderly patients who may benefit from
closer monitoring and individualized interventions. However, the small
sample size, monocentric design, and potential confounders limit
generalizability. These findings support further validation in larger
cohorts.</p>

of gut microbiota on endometriosis: linking physical injury to mental
health</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Endometriosis is widely recognized as a chronic, inflammatory, and
heterogeneous condition that can manifest in various anatomical
locations within females. It is marked by estrogen-driven cycles of
bleeding, cell proliferation, and fibrosis involving ectopic endometrial
glands and stroma cells located outside the uterus. The limited
understanding of its etiology and complex pathogenesis has created
obstacles in achieving early diagnosis and developing effective
treatments with minimal side effects. Consequently, endometriosis
requires more in-depth research to unravel its pathogenesis. The gut
microbiota, a key player in chronic diseases, significantly influences
bodily metabolism and immune regulation. Emerging evidence links the gut
microbiota to inflammation, estrogen metabolism, and immune
responses—key factors in the onset and progression of endometriosis.
This review examines the various mechanisms through which endometriosis
and the gut microbiota interact, aiming to inspire new strategies for
preventing and early treating endometriosis.</p>

impact of Helicobacter pylori infection and eradication therapies on gut
microbiota: a systematic review of microbial dysbiosis and its
implications in gastric carcinogenesis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundHelicobacter pylori is a globally prevalent bacterium
associated with several gastrointestinal diseases, including peptic
ulcers and gastric cancer. Growing interest has emerged in understanding
how H. pylori affects gut microbiota and whether eradication therapies
impact microbial balance, potentially influencing disease outcomes,
including cancer progression.MethodsA systematic review was conducted
across PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases using predefined
keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. Quality assessment
was performed using the MINORS and Jadad scales.ResultsA total of 45
studies met the inclusion criteria, which evaluated microbial changes in
H. pylori -infected individuals before and after eradication therapies.
H. pylori infection resulted in significant alterations in gut and
gastric microbiota, with a notable increase in inflammation-associated
bacteria, such as Proteobacteria and Streptococcus. In gastric cancer
patients, microbial diversity was reduced, with decreased levels of
Bifidobacterium and Actinobacteria, and increased levels of Prevotella
and Dialister, both associated with pro-inflammatory environments.
Eradication therapies generally worsened dysbiosis initially, but
probiotic supplementation promoted faster recovery of beneficial
bacteria, improving microbial balance and reducing cancer-related
dysbiosis.ConclusionH. pylori infection disrupts the gut microbiota,
with eradication therapies further altering microbial composition. The
restoration of microbial diversity is improved by probiotic
supplementation. Understanding the long-term impacts of these therapies
on gut health is essential for refining treatment strategies,
particularly in preventing H. pylori -associated diseases like gastric
cancer.</p>

id="innate-immune-role-of-il-6-in-influenza-a-virus-pathogenesis">Innate
immune role of IL-6 in influenza a virus pathogenesis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pleiotropic cytokine, is induced by infection
of influenza A virus (IAV), where it plays a pivotal role in immune
defense and the regulation of inflammation. IAV induces IL-6
transcription upon recognition by pattern recognition receptors, which
activate downstream signaling cascades, leading to the activation of
transcription factors. Activated transcription factors subsequently
regulate the expression of IL-6 in innate immune cells, such as
macrophages, dendritic cells, and epithelial cells. IL-6 contributes to
antiviral immunity by promoting the recruitment of immune cells to sites
of infection and amplifying the inflammatory response. While optimal
IL-6 production is essential for effective anti-IAV immunity, excessive
IL-6 production can contribute to a dysregulated immune response,
leading to a cytokine storm. In this context, IL-6 signaling, in
coordination with other proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and
IL-1β, not only enhances its own production but can also serve as a key
mediator of inflammation. This cascade can result in exaggerated immune
responses, causing tissue damage and potentially leading to severe
outcomes, including organ failure and death. Understanding the molecular
mechanisms underlying cytokine storms presents important therapeutic
opportunities. However, the precise pathways responsible for excessive
IL-6 production and its dysregulation during IAV infection is not fully
understood. This review explores the reported mechanisms regulating IL-6
induction in response to IAV and its innate immune role in IAV
pathogenesis, highlighting existing research gaps in understanding
IAV-induced IL-6 production and its impact on immune modulation. A
deeper understanding of IAV-induced IL-6 production and signaling could
inform the development of targeted therapies to more effectively manage
influenza.</p>

the distinctive characteristics of gut microbiota across different horse
breeds and ages using metataxonomics</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundGut microbiota exerts a pivotal function in host nutrient
metabolism and maturation of the mucosal immunity. Analyzing the
reciprocal interaction between horses and gut microbiota constitutes a
crucial aspect of scientific feeding practices. This study aims to
investigate the differences in gut microbiota among Hequ horses,
Mongolian horses, and Thoroughbred horses, as well as between
Thoroughbred horses at two age stages.Methods and resultsPaired-end
sequencing with a read length of 2×250 bp targeting the V3-V4 region of
the 16S rRNA gene in fecal samples was carried out. Subsequently,
differences in the diversity, composition, and metabolic pathways of the
gut microbiota among the groups were analyzed. The results showed that:
(1) Horse breeds were associated with variations in the gut microbiota.
Microbial diversity, the proportion of commensal bacteria from Bacillota
and Bacteroidota, and bacterial communities involved in dietary fiber
metabolisms were significantly higher in the gut of the Hequ horses than
in the gut of the Mongolian and Thoroughbred horses. The highest
Bacillota to Bacteroidota (B/B) ratio and enrichment of bacterial
communities involved in the metabolism of bile acids, lipids, and amino
acids in the gut of the Mongolian horses resulted in significantly
higher lipid metabolism and amino acid metabolism than in the other two
breeds. The bacterial communities enriched in the gut of Thoroughbred
horses were primarily involved in carbohydrate metabolism, but the level
of energy metabolism was significantly lower than in Hequ horses. (2)
The results also showed an association between age and gut microbiota of
Thoroughbred horses. The alpha diversity, B/B ratio, and 83.33% of
metabolic pathways did not differ significantly between younger and
older Thoroughbred horses. However, there were significant differences
between the two age groups in beta diversity, composition of glycolytic
bacteria, metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, and energy metabolism of
gut microbiota.ConclusionsCollectively, these results point to an
association between the breed of horses or the age of Thoroughbred
horses with variations in gut microbiota. The current findings will
serve as a reference for improving feeding strategies for horses.</p>

the bioactive compounds of Carica papaya leaves: phytol’s role in
combatting antibiotic-resistant bacteria</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionAntibiotic resistance is a pressing global challenge,
complicating the treatment of infectious diseases caused by
multidrug-resistant microorganism. For centuries, medicinal plants have
been a cornerstone of natural remedies, offering bioactive compounds
with therapeutic potential.MethodsThe study investigate the
phytochemical screening and antibacterial efficay of Carica papaya leaf
extract, focusing on its impact against three Gram-negative bacterial
pathogens i.e., Escherichia coli, Helicobacter pylori, and Salmonella
enterica serovar Typhi, are major contributors to gastrointestinal
infections worldwide, often leading to severe inflammation and chronic
health complications. ResultsThe phytochemical screening revealed the
presence of phenols and flavonoids, which are key contributors to the
extract’s biological activity. GC-MC analysis identified 27 bioactive
compounds, with phytol emerging as a prominent constituent, detected at
a peak retention time of 18.712 minutes. Antibacterial assays
demonstrated significant efficacy, with inhibitory zones ranging from 10
to 20 mm against the tested pathogens. Molecular docking further
highlighted phytol’s strong binding affinities to crucial bacterial
proteins, including DNA gyrase (E. coli), Vacuolating cytotoxin A (H.
pylori) from, and Dihydrofolate reductase (Salmonella enterica serovar
Typhi). Notably, phytol exhibited the highest binding energy (-6.64
kcal/mol) with DHFR, indicating a robust interaction that underscores
its potential as a targeted antibacterial agent against Salmonella
enterica serovar Typhi.DiscussionThese findings position phytol as a
promising lead compound for developing novel antibacterial therapies.
Its strong activity against multidrug-resistant pathogens suggests
potential for further exploration, though additional research is needed
to assess its role in resistance modulation or prevention.</p>

of gut microbiota in neuroinflammation: a focus on perioperative
neurocognitive disorders</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND), including postoperative
delirium, preoperatively cognitive impairment, postoperative cognitive
dysfunction, and delayed neurocognitive recovery, represent common
complications following anesthesia and surgery, especially in the
elderly. As the global population ages, PND is receiving increasing
attention due to its prolonged the hospitalization, reduced quality of
life and elevated mortality rate. A growing body of evidence has been
suggested that the gut-brain axis, a communication system between the
gut microbiota and the neuroinflammation, plays a critical role in the
development and progression of cognitive impairment. Perioperative
interventions, including anesthesia, surgical stress, result in gut
microbiota dysbiosis and subsequently trigger neuroinflammation.
Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the underlying mechanistic
associations between the gut microbiota and the neuroinflammation during
PND progression. In this review, we synthesize current knowledge on the
mechanistic interplay between gut microbiota dysbiosis and
neuroinflammation in PND pathogenesis, which provide reasonable and
novel therapeutic approaches targeting the gut-brain axis for PND.</p>
