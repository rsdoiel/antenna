Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0730 AM CDT Mon Apr 21 2025

Valid 211300Z - 221200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE UPPER OHIO VALLEY AND LOWER GREAT LAKES...AND PORTIONS OF THE
SOUTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms are possible today across
the upper Ohio Valley/lower Great Lakes and parts of the Southeast.
Damaging winds and marginally severe hail are the primary risks.

...Upper Ohio Valley to the Lower Great Lakes...
An upper trough with an attendant 55-70 kt mid-level jet will
advance east-northeastward from the Upper Midwest across the Great
Lakes and Northeast today. A related surface low will develop
northeastward into Ontario/Quebec, while a cold front sweeps
eastward over the OH Valley and parts of the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast through this evening. Modest low-level moisture will
advect northward ahead of this front in tandem with a strong
southwesterly low-level jet. Even though this moisture will remain
somewhat limited, filtered daytime heating and cool mid-level
temperatures should aid weak destabilization in a narrow corridor
along/ahead of the front by early afternoon. Thunderstorms that
develop along the front may pose an isolated severe/damaging wind
threat this afternoon and early evening given the expected strength
of the low/mid-level flow. Occasional hail may also be noted with
the strongest cores, and sufficient low-level shear should exist to
support a tornado or two. The Marginal Risk has been expanded
northward/eastward some based on latest guidance trends regarding
sufficient destabilization to support surface-based convection.

...Southeast...
The trailing portion of the surface cold front should make only slow
east-southeastward progress today across the Southeast. This region
will have weaker low/mid-level winds compared to locations farther
north. Still, around 500-1500 J/kg of MLCAPE should develop by this
afternoon along/ahead of the front, while 25-35 kt of deep-layer
shear aids in modest updraft organization. Any thunderstorms which
develop in this regime could pose an isolated threat for marginally
severe hail and damaging winds. This threat should peak by mid
afternoon, before gradually diminishing through the evening with the
loss of daytime heating.

...Northern Plains...
Gusty winds may occur with high-based convection this afternoon as a
shortwave trough moves eastward over the northern Plains. However,
low-level moisture and instability are both expected to remain very
meager, which should preclude an organized severe wind threat.

...Upper Midwest...
Elevated thunderstorms may develop late tonight across parts of IA
in a low-level warm advection regime. With MUCAPE forecast to remain
less than 1000 J/kg, the potential for severe hail appears too
limited to include low severe probabilities at this time.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0307 AM CDT Mon Apr 21 2025

Valid 241200Z - 291200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Day 4/Thu -- Central/Southern Plains...

Some severe thunderstorm potential is possible across the
southern/central Plains on Day 4/Thu. Similar to the Day 2-3/Tue-Wed
period, a low-amplitude, and generally modest deep-layer
southwesterly flow regime will persist. Southerly low level flow
ahead of a southward sagging front across the central Plains, and to
the east of a dryline extending southward across the southern High
Plains will sustain advection of Gulf moisture across the region. At
least some risk for isolated severe thunderstorms appears possible
within the moist/unstable warm sector. However, convection may be
ongoing across portions of the region Thursday morning, and given a
lack of any stronger upper forcing regime or surface cyclogenesis,
confidence in where greater severe potential may develop is low,
precluding 15 percent delineation at this time.

...Days 5-6/Fri-Sat -- Southern Plains vicinity...

Upper riding is forecast to overspread the Plains late in the week
ahead of a deepening western U.S. upper trough. A cold front will
sag south and east on Friday, extending from the Ohio Valley into
the southern High Plains. As the upper ridge builds, richer Gulf
moisture will develop across TX into OK. Some localized
strong/severe storms may develop across west TX during this time
within the moist upslope flow regime, but the upper ridge and weak
forcing should suppress more widespread severe potential.

...Days 7-8/Sun-Mon -- Plains to the MS Valley...

Severe potential is likely to increase from OK/TX into the central
Plains/Mid-MO Valley by early next week as the western upper trough
begins to eject eastward. This should result in stronger
southwesterly mid/upper flow overspreading a broad warm sector. This
overall pattern is a synoptically favorable spring time pattern for
severe storms across the Plains. Furthermore, control members and
ensemble members from the GFS and ECMWF are in fairly good agreement
regarding the timing/location of the ejecting upper trough and
stronger southwesterly flow overspreading the region. Nevertheless,
uncertainty remains too high to include 15 percent delineated areas
at this time. This is particularly the case of Day 7/Sun where
forecast guidance has widespread precipitation ongoing during the
morning. Given the otherwise favorable pattern, severe probabilities
will likely be needed in the coming days as details become better
refined.

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A relatively zonal upper-flow pattern is expected over the CONUS
tomorrow (Tuesday). At the surface, gradual moisture return is
expected over the Plains into the Mississippi Valley while dry
conditions persist over the Interior West to the High Plains.
However, no significant overlaps of widespread dry and windy
conditions are expected across the CONUS on Tuesday, so quiescent
wildfire-spread conditions should be the norm.

Mesoscale Discussion 0504
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0246 PM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

Areas affected...Northwest/north-central Arkansas into southern
Missouri

Concerning...Tornado Watch 154...

Valid 201946Z - 202115Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 154 continues.

SUMMARY...Storms moving into north-central Arkansas and southern
Missouri will pose a risk of tornadoes--some strong--and damaging
winds. There are signs of discrete storms within the line in
northwest/west-central Arkansas. These storms would bring the
greatest tornado risk.

DISCUSSION...KSRX radar imagery shows a few semi-discrete storms in
far western Arkansas. MRMS CAPPI data also shows these storms
intensifying. Mid-level ascent with southern extent will remain more
limited, but deep-layer shear vectors slightly more perpendicular to
the cold front will also favor discrete storms. VAD data from
KSGF/KLZK/KLSX all have shown an increase in low-level SRH over the
past couple of hours. This trend should continue, particularly in
Missouri. Supercell and QLCS tornadoes, some of which could be
strong, are all possible in this environment. Additionally, the more
linear convective elements will also pose a threat of wind damage.

Mesoscale Discussion 0502
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0220 PM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

Areas affected...Eastern Missouri into western Illinois and far
southeastern Iowa

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 201920Z - 202115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A tornado watch will be forthcoming for portions of
eastern Missouri into western Illinois and far southeastern Iowa, as
a warm frontal boundary continues to lift northward out of central
Missouri.

DISCUSSION...Breaks in cloud cover, along with a northward-lifting
surface warm frontal boundary, have resulted in continued
destabilization across eastern Missouri into western Illinois. With
mixed-layer CAPE forecast to exceed 1000 J/kg in the presence of
strong wind shear (and strong curvature of the low-level hodograph
in the vicinity of the front), the tornado threat is expected to
increase this afternoon into the evening hours. 

Ongoing storms along the MO/KS/OK borders are forecast to continue
north and east into the new watch area, with supercells embedded
within a largely linear complex. Any embedded supercells (especially
any within the vicinity of the warm front), as well as any
pre-frontal storms, will have access to an environment characterized
by strong low-level shear/streamwise vorticity supportive of tornado
development. Current VAD wind profiles from KLSX show 200 m^2/s^2 of
0-500m storm relative helicity -- nearly double what is shown in the
current SPC Mesoanalysis. Given the environmental support for
tornadoes, some of which may be strong, a tornado watch is
anticipated within the next hour or two.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

Valid 202000Z - 211200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS NORTHERN
ARKANSAS AND MISSOURI VICINITY...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected today across parts of the ArkLaTex
into the Ozarks and mid Mississippi Valley, mainly this afternoon
and evening. The best corridor for tornadoes (some of which could be
strong) and scattered to numerous damaging winds should exist from
central/northern Arkansas into Missouri.

...20z Update..
A broken line of thunderstorm activity continues near the surface
low in northeastern OK/southeastern KS and along an attendant
surface cold front extending from eastern OK southward into
northeastern Texas/southern Arkansas. This activity is expected to
continue to shift north and eastward through time as the low tracks
to the east through the afternoon and evening. 

Storm intensity has been increasing over the last couple of hours,
owing to daytime heating ahead of the front, where MLCAPE around
500-1500 J/kg is observed in surface objective analysis. VAD
profiles across eastern Arkansas northward into Missouri show strong
low-level shear in place, with large curved hodographs and rich
low-level SRH. This trend will continue with the strengthening
low-level jet lifting through the Mississippi Valley into the
Midwest this evening, supporting risk for embedded supercells and
tornadoes, a few of which may be strong. In addition to the tornado
threat, bowing structures along the front will support risk for
damaging winds. See MCD#502 and MCD#504 for more information.

Thunderstorm coverage will increase along the southern portion of
the front in central/eastern Texas into Louisiana through the
afternoon and evening. This region is somewhat removed from the area
of greater low and mid-level flow, which will keep severe potential
more limited. See previous discussion for more information.

..Thornton/Goss.. 04/20/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1129 AM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025/

...Synopsis...
A compact upper low currently moving into western Oklahoma will
shift quickly northeastward this afternoon and tonight, crossing
eastern Kansas and western Missouri this evening and then continuing
northeastward across Iowa and into Wisconsin tonight.  Fast
southwesterly flow aloft will exist in advance of this system,
within the tight height gradient between this feature and the
persistent ridge centered over the Southeast.

At the surface, a developing low analyzed over western Oklahoma at
15Z is forecast to progress northeastward across southeastern Kansas
and Missouri through the afternoon, and then should continue
northward toward -- and eventually into -- southern Wisconsin by
early Monday morning.  While a warm front lifts northward across the
Mid Mississippi Valley/Midwest, a cold front trailing from the low
will sweep eastward into/across Missouri and Arkansas this afternoon
and evening, and then across the Mid and Lower Mississippi Valleys
through the end of the period.

...Northeastern Texas northeastward to the western Illinois
vicinity...
An expansive area of multi-level cloud cover, along with ongoing
convection, is evident across western and northern portions of the
risk area late this morning, which continues to retard more
substantial heating at this point.  With that said, some breaks in
the clouds are evident per recent visible imagery as far west as
eastern Oklahoma, with thinning cloud cover with
eastward/northeastward extent into Arkansas and the Ozarks.

As the surface low over Oklahoma deepens through the day in tandem
with the advance of the upper low, northward advance of the warm
front with time will allow a moist boundary layer to likewise
overspread much of Missouri and Illinois through sunset.  This,
combined with at least modest heating across portions of the area
should yield an amply unstable environment (500 to near 1500 J/kg
mixed-layer CAPE) to gradually evolve -- supporting a steady
increase in convective coverage and intensity this afternoon.

In contrast to the rather modest thermodynamic environment, a very
favorable low-level and deep-layer wind field is evident, with
respect to development of organized/rotating storms.  An 80 kt
mid-level jet will spread northeastward across the risk area with
time, atop a 50-plus kt low-level jet.  This will support vigorous
updraft evolution, with all-hazards severe risk evolving as a
result.  At this time, it remains apparent that tornado potential --
including risk for a couple of strong tornadoes -- should maximize
across the Ozarks, and areas just north and south, as surface winds
back to southeasterly ahead of the deepening/advancing surface low. 
The primary risk should evolve with an anticipated, broken band of
storms within the cold-frontal zone, including embedded supercells.

Along with the tornado potential, fairly widespread coverage of
damaging wind gusts is also expected, as complex, LEWP/bow-type
structures are expected within the band of storms, as convection
advances eastward across Missouri and Arkansas toward the
Mississippi Valley through the afternoon and into the evening hours.
Severe risk is expected to expand as far north as southeastern Iowa
and adjacent western Illinois this evening, where weaker instability
is expected, and as far south as eastern Texas where a weaker wind
field with southward extent should limit severe potential on the
southern fringe.  Risk should very gradually diminish overnight as
convection shifts eastward across the Mid-Mississippi Valley.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0226 PM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF
THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible on Tuesday across
portions of the southern Plains.

...Synopsis...
Modest west-southwesterly flow is forecast from the Southwest to the
southern Plains on Tuesday with a stronger mid-level jet across the
northern Plains and a sharpening trough in the Pacific Northwest. A
weak mid-level shortwave trough (indicated by most guidance) is
forecast to cross New Mexico during the afternoon which would result
in a sharpening dryline and perhaps some lee cyclogenesis.

...Southern High Plains into southern Kansas...
Low-level moisture advection and strong heating across the southern
High Plains will lead to moderate to strong destabilization ahead of
the dryline.  As this airmass becomes uncapped by early to
mid-afternoon and ascent increases ahead of the approaching
mid-level shortwave trough, expect scattered thunderstorm
development. A deeply mixed boundary layer and 25 to 35 knots of
shear will support supercells capable of large hail and severe wind
gusts. Storms will likely congeal into an MCS by later in the
evening as the low-level jet strengthens with some severe wind
threat which could continue into the overnight hours. 

A remnant frontal boundary will likely be in place across southern
Kansas Tuesday afternoon which will likely be an additional focus
for potential severe storms Tuesday afternoon. Moisture/instability
remains more questionable across southern Kansas, and shear is not
forecast to be quite as strong amid somewhat veered low-level flow
ahead of the front. Therefore, a marginal risk (level 1 of 5) has
been maintained at this time.

...Central Iowa to southern Wisconsin and Northern Illinois... 
Moisture recovery along a warm frontal zone may lead to some weak
instability from eastern Iowa into southern Wisconsin and northern
Illinois. Sustained isentropic ascent may provide sufficient forcing
for isolated to scattered thunderstorm development through the day.
Despite the lack of moisture, cool temperatures aloft and steep
lapse rates may support the potential for isolated large hail and
damaging wind gusts.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1204 PM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorm potential appears low on Monday.

...Synopsis...
An upper low/shortwave trough over the Upper Midwest on Monday
morning will lift northeast across the Great Lakes into southern
Ontario and western Quebec by Tuesday morning. Meanwhile, another
upper shortwave trough over the northern Rockies will develop
eastward to the northern Plains. At the surface, an area of low
pressure will move from Wisconsin to Quebec through the period with
a trailing cold front moving from the Ohio Valley to the
north-central Appalachians and into the Mid-Atlantic. This front
will be more stationary across the Mid-Mississippi Valley and may
start to move north by the end of the period across south-central
Texas.

...Ohio Valley/Lower Great Lakes to the TN/Lower MS
Valleys/Southeast TX...
A narrow corridor of mid 60s dewpoints may be present across the
Ohio Valley on Monday which could result in some weak instability
despite extensive cloud cover and poor lapse rates. Robust vertical
shear could result in a few stronger storms capable of isolated
damaging wind gusts, but the limited instability should keep the
threat minimal overall.

Better-quality boundary layer moisture, slightly better lapse rates,
and the potential for some warming may result in greater instability
farther south, perhaps up to 1000 J/kg MLCAPE. However, vertical
shear will be very weak where this better instability is forecast to
develop. A couple of strong storms will be capable of locally strong
gusts or small hail, but a lack of stronger vertical shear will
likely limit longevity of any stronger/better organized updrafts,
precluding severe probabilities.

...Northern Plains...
Cold temperatures aloft with the upper shortwave trough will support
steep midlevel lapse rates from MT into the northern Plains
vicinity. As weak instability develops across the northern Plains,
scattered thunderstorms are possible. A well-mixed air mass could
support an isolated severe wind threat, particularly across
southwest South Dakota and vicinity where mid-level flow will be
strongest.

Additional thunderstorms may develop overnight across eastern SD
into southern MN/northern IA on the nose of a developing low-level
jet. This activity may produce small hail into early Tuesday
morning.

## SPC Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1157 AM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

Valid 201700Z - 211200Z

...17z Update...
The prior forecast remains on track with only minor changes to the
ongoing fire-weather risk areas for the latest guidance. Across
southern New England, several hours of dry and breezy conditions are
possible behind an offshore cold front. Gusts of 15-20 mph may
overlap with RH below 20% this afternoon. While some wetting rain
has tempered fuels on a scattered basis, enough dry fuels likely
exist for some fire-weather threat.

Across parts of the Dakotas and western MN, several hours of dry
southerly winds are likely ahead of a surface trough. Gusts of 20-30
mph with RH below 30% could support some risk for fire concerns in
dry grasses and fine fuels. However, larger fuels remain less
receptive and some trimming was made on the eastern edge where
wetting rainfall has occurred in the last 72 hours.

..Lyons.. 04/20/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0157 AM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough and corresponding surface low will traverse the
Midwest as another upper trough ejects into the Atlantic from the
Northeast today, encouraging deep-layer offshore flow along the New
England coastline. While the overall synoptic pattern does not favor
widespread, significant wildfire-spread potential across the CONUS,
a few regional concerns for Elevated conditions do exist. 

Somewhat dry southerly return flow over portions of the Northern
Plains may promote 15-20 mph sustained winds amid 25-30 percent RH
this afternoon. Some wildfire-spread potential exists wherever dry
fuel beds are present. Next, dry southeasterly flow will continue
across western parts of the Florida Peninsula, with Elevated
highlights continued across this region given 15 mph wind speeds
coinciding with 25-35 percent RH atop dry fuels by afternoon.
Lastly, 15-20 mph northwesterly surface flow will overlap with 25-40
percent RH across portions of New England by afternoon peak heating.
Given an overall lack of heavy rainfall in this area in the past
week, it is not out of the question for finer fuels to respond
accordingly and support some potential for wildfire spread.

Valid 201630Z - 211200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
NORTHERN ARKANSAS AND MISSOURI VICINITY...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected today across parts of the ArkLaTex
into the Ozarks and mid Mississippi Valley, mainly this afternoon
and evening. The best corridor for tornadoes (some of which could be
strong) and scattered to numerous damaging winds should exist from
central/northern Arkansas into Missouri.

...Synopsis...
A compact upper low currently moving into western Oklahoma will
shift quickly northeastward this afternoon and tonight, crossing
eastern Kansas and western Missouri this evening and then continuing
northeastward across Iowa and into Wisconsin tonight.  Fast
southwesterly flow aloft will exist in advance of this system,
within the tight height gradient between this feature and the
persistent ridge centered over the Southeast.

At the surface, a developing low analyzed over western Oklahoma at
15Z is forecast to progress northeastward across southeastern Kansas
and Missouri through the afternoon, and then should continue
northward toward -- and eventually into -- southern Wisconsin by
early Monday morning.  While a warm front lifts northward across the
Mid Mississippi Valley/Midwest, a cold front trailing from the low
will sweep eastward into/across Missouri and Arkansas this afternoon
and evening, and then across the Mid and Lower Mississippi Valleys
through the end of the period.

...Northeastern Texas northeastward to the western Illinois
vicinity...
An expansive area of multi-level cloud cover, along with ongoing
convection, is evident across western and northern portions of the
risk area late this morning, which continues to retard more
