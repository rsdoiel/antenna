Mesoscale Discussion 0561
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0344 PM CDT Fri Apr 25 2025

Areas affected...the Trans-Pecos and Permian Basin

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 173...

Valid 252044Z - 252215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 173
continues.

SUMMARY...A localized very large hail threat should be confined to
the Trans-Pecos and adjacent Pecos Valley into early evening.

DISCUSSION...A slow-moving supercell has been drifting east, west of
Fort Stockton. Additional storm-development appears likely to be
delayed until early evening or later based on recent visible
satellite and HRRR trends. 19Z observed sounding at Midland sampled
weak 0-3 km shear/SRH, limiting low-level hodograph curvature.
Still, adequate speed shear through the buoyancy layer will support
large to very large hail potential with the supercell or two that
anchor near the higher terrain. As low-level southeasterlies
increase in the next few hours, additional storms may develop north
into far southeast NM.

Mesoscale Discussion 0560
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0319 PM CDT Fri Apr 25 2025

Areas affected...the TX South Plains

Concerning...Tornado Watch 172...

Valid 252019Z - 252145Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 172 continues.

SUMMARY...Greatest potential for a slow-moving, long-lived intense
supercell will be across the Texas South Plains portion of WW 172,
along a largely west/east-oriented outflow boundary.

DISCUSSION...Initial sustained supercell development has been
drifting east over Bailey County, with additional incipient cells to
its east towards Plainview. Surface/low-level convergence will
remain maximized near the TX/NM border over the next couple hours,
which should support further intensification of this ongoing
activity. With only around 20-kts of 0-3 km shear per the Lubbock
VWP, very large hail should remain the overarching threat in the
near term, potentially reaching baseball to softball size. But
strengthening of low-level east-southeasterlies should commence in
the next couple hours. A corresponding increase in tornado potential
is expected into early evening with ingest of mid 60s surface dew
points from the Low Rolling Plains. Given weak large-scale ascent,
convection should remain discrete enough into this time frame to
support potential for a strong tornado in the most intense/mature
supercell anchored along the mesoscale outflow boundary.

Mesoscale Discussion 0559
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0219 PM CDT Fri Apr 25 2025

Areas affected...Central/eastern Kentucky into southern Ohio

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 251919Z - 252115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...An isolated strong/potentially damaging wind gust could
occur this afternoon. A watch is not needed.

DISCUSSION...Convection has developed within an area of thinner
cirrus canopy in central Kentucky. This is occurring in response to
a weak shortwave in the Midwest. Modest effective shear of around 25
kts could promote a stronger storm or two. Enhanced 850 mb winds
ahead of the surface low/cold front will allow few
stronger/potentially damaging winds to mix to the surface in the
most intense storms. Furthermore, weak but sufficient low-level
hodograph curvature is noted in KLVX/KJKL VAD data. It is possible a
storm or two could exhibit weak low-level rotation. However, tornado
potential is low. Additionally, low/mid-level lapse rates and
mid/upper-level wind shear are all weak. Any severe threat that
develops will be spatially limited and marginal.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 173
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
240 PM CDT Fri Apr 25 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southeast New Mexico
  West Texas

* Effective this Friday afternoon and evening from 240 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 3
    inches in diameter likely
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Isolated thunderstorms are forecast to develop and
intensify this afternoon into the evening.  Initially storms will
likely focus near the higher terrain but will eventually move east
into lower elevations.  The stronger storms will likely become
supercells with both left and right splitting supercells possible. 
Large to very large hail will be the primary risk with these storms.
 A tornado is possible during the early evening as low-level winds
strengthen.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles east and west of a line from 55 miles east northeast
of Carlsbad NM to 45 miles southwest of Fort Stockton TX. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU3).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0247 PM CDT Fri Apr 25 2025

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR FAR EASTERN ARIZONA INTO CENTRAL
NEW MEXICO...

...Day 2 Update...
Latest model guidance consensus suggests slightly higher southwest
surface winds on Saturday in advance of a robust upper-level trough.
Higher ensemble probabilities of overlapping southwest winds of 20
mph or greater and relative humidity of 15 percent or lower exist in
the higher terrain of far eastern Arizona into central New Mexico,
where Critical highlights have been added.

..Williams/Weinman.. 04/25/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1245 AM CDT Fri Apr 25 2025/

...Synopsis...
By early Saturday evening, a mid-level trough is forecast to arrive
over central California, with southwest flow overspreading much of
the intermountain West. An intensifying surface cyclone in the Great
Basin associated with this trough will be responsible for gusty
southerly winds across the southern Rockies into the southern High
Plains, resulting in Elevated to locally Critical fire-weather
conditions across portions of Arizona and New Mexico. 

...Central New Mexico into Eastern Arizona...
20 MPH winds and 10-15% relative humidity (perhaps even dipping into
the single-digits across New Mexico) will be responsible for at
least Elevated fire-weather concerns, especially given fuels
guidance with ERCs already at or exceeding the 80th-90th annual
percentiles. Some locally Critical conditions may occur where local
terrain enhancement of the winds are favored, but lack of confidence
in widespread 25+ MPH winds based on forecast guidance precludes
specific highlights at this time. However, if guidance comes into
better agreement, a Critical highlight may be needed for portions of
central New Mexico.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0244 PM CDT Fri Apr 25 2025

Valid 252000Z - 261200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FAR
EAST-CENTRAL NEW MEXICO INTO THE TEXAS SOUTH PLAINS AND CAPROCK...

...SUMMARY...
A concentrated area of severe thunderstorms is forecast centered on
the Texas South Plains during the late afternoon and evening.  A few
tornadoes will be possible, as well as large to giant hail being
probable with the more intense supercells.

...20z Update...
Tornado risk probabilities have been increased to 10% (with
significant hatching) within a focused corridor across parts of the
TX South Plains/Caprock. Latest radar imagery shows convective
initiation well underway along a residual outflow boundary to the
northwest of the Lubbock, TX area. Additional convective towers are
noted in visible imagery to the east of the developing storm,
lending high confidence in supercell development within the coming
hours. These cells will likely propagate to the east/southeast along
residual boundaries into a region with mid 60s dewpoints (moisture
that is above the 90th percentile for west TX in late April) and
east/southeasterly low-level flow. Weak 1-3 km winds have been
recently noted in regional VWPs that will favor a very large hail
threat through late afternoon; however, increasing flow within the
925-850 mb layer after 00z will result in low-level hodograph
enlargement and promote an increasing tornado threat (including the
potential for a strong tornado) heading into the evening hours prior
to upscale growth later tonight. See the previous discussion below
for additional details.

..Moore.. 04/25/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1145 AM CDT Fri Apr 25 2025/

...Far Eastern NM...TX Panhandle...West TX...
Upper ridging over the High Plains will be downstream of a western
U.S. upper trough.  In the low levels, a frontal zone has pushed
south into the TX Panhandle with a diffuse outflow boundary
extending from east TX west-northwestward into the Low Rolling
Plains/Caprock vicinity.  Farther west, a dryline extends south over
eastern NM with a seasonably moisture-rich airmass (60s surface
dewpoints) located south and east of the aforementioned boundaries. 
Visible satellite imagery shows mostly clear skies with strong
heating expected through the late afternoon.  

Model guidance shows 2000-3000 J/kg MLCAPE developing by mid-late
afternoon as convective inhibition gradually erodes near the
boundaries.  Forecast soundings show southeasterly to southerly flow
veering to 20-30 kt southwesterly mid-level flow, and further
increasing to 70-kt in the upper levels.  The magnitude of buoyancy
and shear will strongly favor intense supercells initially.  Large
to giant hail (up to 2.5 to 4.0 inches in diameter) will likely
accompany the stronger supercells.  A tornado risk will probably
focus in the vicinity of mesoscale boundaries and peak during the
early evening, when a strengthening of low-level flow is expected. 
Upscale growth into a cluster is possible this evening with the
hail/tornado risk gradually transitioning to mostly a wind risk
late.  

Farther south into the Permian Basin, a couple of intense supercells
are possible later this afternoon into the evening.  Large to giant
hail appears to be the primary severe hazard, although a tornado is
possible during the early evening.  

...Lower MS Valley/Southeast into TN and OH Valley...
Scattered to numerous showers/thunderstorms are forecast to develop
from the OH Valley south into the lower MS Valley within a
moist/weakly unstable airmass.  Some modest enhancement to low-level
flow and hodographs over parts of the OH Valley may result in a few
transient organized cells.  Despite moist profiles and limited lapse
rates, localized wind damage (45-55 mph gusts) may accompany the
stronger storms for a few hours this afternoon.

Day 3 Convective Outlook

0231 PM CDT Fri Apr 25 2025

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF
NEBRASKA AND VICINITY...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe storms are possible across the southern High Plains
and central Plains Sunday afternoon/evening. Scattered severe storms
are possible across the northern Plains and Upper Midwest Sunday
evening/night.

...Synopsis...
Continued eastward progression of the western U.S. upper low/trough
will occur Sunday.  Eventually, this trough will begin to displace
persistent central U.S. upper ridging, with the first effects -- in
the form height falls -- spreading gradually across the Plains
Sunday afternoon through Sunday night.

Ahead of the trough, a cold front crossing the western U.S. will
begin to emerge into the Plains, trailing southwestward from a low
shifting gradually into/across the Nebraska vicinity.  By the end of
the period, this front should extend from the Mid Missouri Valley
south-southwestward to West Texas.

...The Plains...
Low-level moistening spreading northward across the Plains in
advance of the approaching front will combine with daytime heating
to result in moderate pre-frontal destabilization.  The effects of
ridging-induced subsidence -- in the form of boundary-layer capping
-- will persist through much of the day, hindering more widespread
development of diurnal storms.

By late afternoon/early evening however, isolated storm development
is expected, likely most widespread across the Nebraska vicinity
just ahead of the surface low shifting into the region.  Here,
increasing mid-level flow atop low-level southerlies will provide
sufficient shear for a few severe/rotating storms, likely
accompanied by an all-hazards severe risk.  Farther south along the
advancing front, storms should remain much more isolated, but would
likely pose local severe risk given a thermodynamic and kinematic
environment that would support organized/rotating storms.

Overnight, an increasing southerly low-level jet -- and associated
warm advection across the Dakotas atop the warm front -- should
sustain late-period storms, and at least some severe risk.

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS
OF EASTERN NEW MEXICO AND ADJACENT WESTERN TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
A couple of strong to severe thunderstorms are possible on Saturday
across portions of eastern New Mexico into adjacent western Texas.

...Synopsis...
Large-scale ridging aloft will persist across the central U.S.
Saturday, as short-wave troughing over the Great Lakes region moves
into/across the Lower Lakes/Northeast, and a western U.S. upper low
makes slow eastward progress across California and into Nevada.

At the surface, a cold front will shift eastward across the
Northeast and Mid-Atlantic region, while trailing westward across
the Gulf Coast states and into the southern Plains.

...Parts of eastern New Mexico and adjacent western Texas...
Widespread convection is forecast to be ongoing at the start of the
period within a zone from far eastern New Mexico eastward to
Oklahoma/North Texas.  Resulting cloud cover and likely southward
progression of outflow across western Texas casts some uncertainty
with respect to recovery of the afternoon airmass across the MRGL
risk area.  Presuming ample heating occurs, isolated, new-storm
development -- likely near remnant outflow -- may pose additional
potential for local, all-hazards severe potential.  This area will
likely require some adjustment in later outlooks, as the effects of
early-day convection can be more accurately ascertained.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1151 AM CDT Fri Apr 25 2025

Valid 251700Z - 261200Z

...Day 1 Update...
Minor modifications were made to Elevated highlights across New
Mexico. Southeast surface winds are expected to persist today across
southeastern New Mexico, inhibiting drier downslope flow off the
Sacramento Mountains from mixing out the shallow moist layer in
place. A very dry boundary layer across the Southwest combined with
increasing southwest winds is still expected to bring elevated fire
weather conditions to far eastern Arizona and western New Mexico
where dry fuels/drought remains.

..Williams/Weinman.. 04/25/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1244 AM CDT Fri Apr 25 2025/

...Synopsis...
As a mid-level trough approaches the U.S. west coast, and associated
southwest flow overspreads the Four Corners into the Great Basin,
dry and windy conditions are forecast across much of the southern
Rockies into the southern High Plains. 


...Central New Mexico into Far Eastern Arizona...
Relative humidity of 10-20% and 15-20 MPH winds are expected across
much of central and western New Mexico into eastern Arizona this
afternoon into the early evening, where current fuels guidance has
ERCs at or exceeding the 80th-90th annual percentiles. Some locally
Critical conditions may exist where local topography provides an
enhancement of surface winds.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR FAR
EAST-CENTRAL NEW MEXICO INTO THE TEXAS SOUTH PLAINS AND CAPROCK...

...SUMMARY...
A concentrated area of severe thunderstorms is forecast centered on
the Texas South Plains during the late afternoon and evening.  A
couple of tornadoes will be possible, as well as large to giant hail
being probable with the more intense supercells.

...Far Eastern NM...TX Panhandle...West TX...
Upper ridging over the High Plains will be downstream of a western
U.S. upper trough.  In the low levels, a frontal zone has pushed
south into the TX Panhandle with a diffuse outflow boundary
extending from east TX west-northwestward into the Low Rolling
Plains/Caprock vicinity.  Farther west, a dryline extends south over
eastern NM with a seasonably moisture-rich airmass (60s surface
dewpoints) located south and east of the aforementioned boundaries. 
Visible satellite imagery shows mostly clear skies with strong
heating expected through the late afternoon.  

Model guidance shows 2000-3000 J/kg MLCAPE developing by mid-late
afternoon as convective inhibition gradually erodes near the
boundaries.  Forecast soundings show southeasterly to southerly flow
veering to 20-30 kt southwesterly mid-level flow, and further
increasing to 70-kt in the upper levels.  The magnitude of buoyancy
and shear will strongly favor intense supercells initially.  Large
to giant hail (up to 2.5 to 4.0 inches in diameter) will likely
accompany the stronger supercells.  A tornado risk will probably
focus in the vicinity of mesoscale boundaries and peak during the
early evening, when a strengthening of low-level flow is expected. 
Upscale growth into a cluster is possible this evening with the
hail/tornado risk gradually transitioning to mostly a wind risk
late.  

Farther south into the Permian Basin, a couple of intense supercells
are possible later this afternoon into the evening.  Large to giant
hail appears to be the primary severe hazard, although a tornado is
possible during the early evening.  

...Lower MS Valley/Southeast into TN and OH Valley...
Scattered to numerous showers/thunderstorms are forecast to develop
from the OH Valley south into the lower MS Valley within a
moist/weakly unstable airmass.  Some modest enhancement to low-level
flow and hodographs over parts of the OH Valley may result in a few
transient organized cells.  Despite moist profiles and limited lapse
rates, localized wind damage (45-55 mph gusts) may accompany the
stronger storms for a few hours this afternoon.

0730 AM CDT Fri Apr 25 2025

Valid 251300Z - 261200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF
FAR EASTERN NM...THE TX PANHANDLE...WEST TEXAS AND SOUTHWEST OK...

...SUMMARY...
A concentrated area of severe thunderstorms is forecast over the
Texas South Plains and vicinity during the late afternoon and
evening. Large hail and localized wind damage appears likely.

...Synopsis...
Recent satellite imagery shows a cyclone west off the central West
Coast, with a shortwave trough progressing through its base into
southern CA. Upper ridging exists downstream from the southern
Plains through the northern Rockies while a low-amplitude shortwave
trough moves into the Lower OH Valley. A convectively enhanced
shortwave trough is also moving through the Lower MS Valley.

The southern CA shortwave is forecast to continue rotating around
the cyclone off the West Coast, moving through the Great Basin this
afternoon. The downstream ridging will shift eastward and build into
the Plains in response, while both the Lower OH Valley and Lower MS
Valley shortwaves progress eastward. Thunderstorm development is
anticipated across much of the OH and TN Valley as well as the Lower
MS Valley and Southeast ahead of these waves.

Early morning surface analysis places a low over in the TX/OK/NM
border intersection vicinity, with a dryline extending
west-southwestward across far southeast NM and far west TX. A cold
front also extends northeastward from this low to another low near
the MO/IL/IA border intersection. Strong to severe thunderstorms are
anticipated along the dryline across the TX Panhandle and West TX
this afternoon and evening.

...Far Eastern NM...TX Panhandle...West TX...
Recent surface observations already show dewpoints in the 60s across
much of far eastern NM, West TX and the TX Panhandle. Strong heating
is anticipated within this corridor today, to the south of a
slow-moving cold front and to the west of outflow from Thursday
night's thunderstorms. Upper ridging is expected to build across the
region, negating any large-scale ascent and placing the primary
impetus for convective initiation along the cold front, dryline, and
outflow boundary. Even so, convergence along this boundaries,
particularly the dryline and outflow should be enough for convective
initiation within the uncapped airmass. 

Mid-level flow may be a bit weaker than yesterday, but low-level
southeasterlies veering to southwesterly aloft should still result
in enough shear for updraft organization and supercells. Large to
very large hail will be the primary risk, but some localized tornado
threat could develop, particularly if a coherent outflow boundary
remains in place. Storm motion will be slow while storms are
discrete, but one or more forward-progressing clusters may evolve
over time, bringing the potential for strong gusts into northwest TX
and southwest OK.

...Lower MS Valley/Southeast into TN and OH Valley...
Widespread thunderstorm development is anticipated this afternoon as
the pair of shortwave troughs mentioned in the synopsis interact
with the moist and modestly buoyant airmass over the region.
Vertical shear will be weak, and a predominantly multicellular storm
mode is expected. This should limit the overall severe potential,
but a few damaging gusts are still possible.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0354 AM CDT Fri Apr 25 2025

Valid 281200Z - 031200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Day 4/Mon - Southern Plains to Upper Midwest...
A strong mid-level jet streak will move rapidly northeastward from
the Southwest to the Upper Midwest on Monday. As this occurs, a
surface low will deepen and move from the northern Plains to the
northern Great Lakes. Strong southwesterly lower tropospheric flow
will advect high theta-e air northward across the Midwest and into
parts of the Upper Midwest. Broken to scattered cloudcover will
support surface heating and strong destabilization across the warm
sector from southeast Minnesota and western Wisconsin to the
southern Plains. Isolated to scattered supercells are likely along
the dryline which will extend from the southern Plains and into
Kansas. 

The greatest focus for severe weather on Monday will be from eastern
Kansas into northern Missouri, much of Iowa and into southern
Minnesota and western Wisconsin. Moderate to strong instability,
strong shear, and increasing forcing for ascent supports the
potential for numerous rounds of severe thunderstorms. The wind
profile supports supercells capable of all severe weather hazards
including the potential for strong tornadoes. 

...Day 5/Tue - Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast...
The surface low associated with the Day 4 threat will continue
northeast and bring its associated cold front eastward across the
Midwest and Great Lakes through the day Tuesday. Moderate to strong
instability is forecast south of this front from northern New York
to the Ohio Valley. Much of the frontal zone should have sufficient
shear to support multiple storm clusters and the potential for a few
supercells. 

Day 6/Wed-Day8/Fri - Portions of the Mid-Mississippi Valley into the
Southeast...
A weaker mid-level shortwave trough is consistently depicted by
extended range guidance by the middle of next week across the
southern Plains. However, significant uncertainty remains about the
strength of this trough and location of any frontal zones. In
addition, convection across the southern Plains each day of the
extended range forecast could significantly impact destabilization
by Day 6-8. Therefore, confidence is not high enough to add
probabilities at this time, but they may eventually be needed
somewhere across the Southeast/Mid Mississippi Valley.

Areas affected...eastern Colorado

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 242045Z - 242245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Some instances of severe hail and gusty winds possible
this afternoon/evening.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm activity is ongoing near and south of the
Denver metro this afternoon. Moisture in this region is limited,
with dew points in the upper 40s to 50s. Nonetheless, ongoing
convection will have potential to produce instances of mainly
sub-severe hail given steep lapse rates and cooling aloft. 

As this development and any additional development shifts further
south and east, it will enter a region with temperatures in the low
to mid 70s and dew points in the low to mid-50s near the CO/KS
border MLCAPE around 500-1000 J/kg and deep layer shear around 30-35
kts is observed in surface objective analysis as of 20z. This
environment may support some increase in coverage and intensity,
with better potential for severe hail and wind. Trends will be
monitored for potential watch issuance this evening.

Areas affected...parts of cntrl and sern TX

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 241933Z - 242130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...A cluster of thunderstorms continues to organize, with
signs of increasing potential to produce strong to severe gusts
while propagating southeastward toward the mid/upper Texas coastal
plain through 5-7 PM CDT.

DISCUSSION...Forcing for ascent associated with
lower/mid-tropospheric warm advection, and southeasterly updraft
inflow of seasonably moist boundary-layer air (characterized by CAPE
in excess of 2000 J/Kg), have maintained vigorous thunderstorm
development.  Activity has undergone notable intensification and
increasing organization, and it appears that a meso-beta scale
cyclonic circulation is becoming better-defined near the Waco
vicinity, where a couple of 50+ kt surface gusts have recently been
observed.  

Despite continued gradual warming around 700 mb, and some suggestion
that the larger-scale forcing for ascent may weaken, the
boundary-layer ahead of the storms remains potentially supportive of
further intensification of the convective system, southeastward
toward the mid/upper Texas coastal plain into early evening. 
Deep-layer mean flow and shear remain generally modest, as does the
strength of the surface cold pool (as of 19Z observational data). 
However, with further strengthening of the mesoscale vortex and
west-northwesterly rear inflow, there remains potential for a
continued increase in risk for strong to severe gusts during the
next few hours.

  1100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A couple tornadoes possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 4
    inches in diameter likely
  Isolated damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Widely scattered thunderstorms are forecast to rapidly
develop this afternoon into the early evening.  Environmental shear
and buoyancy combinations strongly favor intense, discrete
supercells.  Large to giant hail will be probable with any
supercell.  The tornado risk will likely focus for a few hours
during the early evening near a residual outflow boundary draped
over parts of the Watch area.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 166
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
255 PM CDT Thu Apr 24 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central into East Texas

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 255 PM until
  800 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A linear cluster of strong to severe thunderstorms will
likely continue east across much of the Watch area this afternoon
into the early evening.  Severe gusts 60-70 mph appear to be the
primary hazard, but large hail may accompany the stronger cells on
the southwestern flank of the thunderstorm band.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 50
statute miles north and south of a line from 35 miles west of Temple
TX to 25 miles east of Lufkin TX. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
28030.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0637 AM CDT Thu Apr 24 2025

Areas affected...Central and North Texas...Southern Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 241137Z - 241400Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A severe threat may continue across parts of central and
north Texas this morning. Isolated severe gusts and hail will be the
primary threats. The potential for weather watch issuance is low.

DISCUSSION...Mosaic radar imagery shows a line of strong
thunderstorms located from southern Oklahoma into north Texas, with
a linear cluster extending southward into central Texas. The storms
are located near a moist axis where surface dewpoints are in the mid
to upper 60s F. Across the moist airmass, the RAP is estimating
MLCAPE in the 1000 to 1500 J/kg range. The instability, combined
with large-scale ascent ahead of a shortwave trough and warm
advection are supporting the storms. In addition, the FWS WSR-88D
VWP has 0-6 km shear has 30 to 35 knots with some directional shear
in the low to mid-levels. This shear environment should be enough to
continue an isolated wind-damage and hail threat. The severe threat
may increase locally over the next hour or two, as the cells to the
south merge with the line to the north.

Mesoscale Discussion 0528
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0239 PM CDT Wed Apr 23 2025

Areas affected...parts of wrn KS...sern CO...OK Pnhdl

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 231939Z - 232215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Intensifying thunderstorm development appears increasingly
probable through the 4-6 PM CDT time frame, including the potential
for supercells posing a risk for large hail and tornadoes in a
focused area near/southeast of Goodland.

DISCUSSION...With daytime heating and mixing, the boundary-layer
within surface troughing across the Texas/Oklahoma Panhandle
vicinity through western Kansas continues to deepen and destabilize.
It now appears generally characterized by surface temperature/dew
point spreads in excess of 30 F, with CAPE increasing to 1500-2000+
J/kg.

Inhibition is in the process of weakening, and deepening high-based
convection is now evident within the axis of stronger
destabilization.  With further insolation, the initiation of
thunderstorms appears increasingly probable, some of which may
eventually be accompanied by small hail and localized strong
downbursts.

Of greater concern is the potential for convective development where
better low-level moisture, on the western periphery of outflow
associated with persistent ongoing convection across central Kansas,
intersects the axis of stronger heating.  This appears focused near
a weak developing cyclonic circulation southeast of Goodland, where
shear associated with clockwise turning of low-level wind fields
with height, beneath a belt of 30 kt westerly flow around 500 mb, is
likely sufficient for supercells.  This is where potential for large
hail appears maximized, and near-surface CAPE/upward vertical
accelerations may promote the potential for tornadoes.

Areas affected...far southwestern Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 231914Z - 232115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Risk for gusty winds and large hail possible this
afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Deepening cumulus is observed across the Davis
Mountains and ahead of the surface dryline across far western Texas.
Temperatures have warmed into the upper 70s to 80s which has led to
weakening of MLCIN across the region. Convective initiation should
occur in the next 1-2 hours. Ahead of the dryline, MLCAPE around
1000-2000 J/kg  with deep layer shear around 35-40 kts. This will
support supercells capable of large hail (some very large) and
damaging winds, given steep lapse rates around 8-9 C/km. A watch may
be needed in the coming hour.

Areas affected...portions of western Oklahoma...south-central Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 222025Z - 222230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Damaging wind and severe hail risk to increase through the
afternoon/evening.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorm activity has initiated and expected to
continue to form along the dryline across the Texas Panhandle this
afternoon. Additional thunderstorm development is expected across
the frontal boundary draped across western/central Kansas into the
Oklahoma Panhandle. Ahead of this development, the air mass across
western Oklahoma into central/eastern Kansas has been suppressed
owing to weak forcing and stout MLCIN most of the afternoon.
Temperatures are warming, with MLCIN eroding west to east across the
Texas Panhandle as temperatures have climbed into the 80s. Aloft
sounding analysis indicates, steep lapse rates and ample CAPE above
the 850 mb inversion.

Thunderstorm activity will gradually shift into this region by late
afternoon/evening. A mix of multi-cell clusters and embedded
supercells capable of large hail and damaging wind are expected. A
watch will likely be needed in the coming hours to cover this risk.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0217 PM CDT Tue Apr 22 2025

Areas affected...southwestern Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 221917Z - 222115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Damaging wind and hail risk to increase through the
afternoon/evening.

DISCUSSION...Surface analysis shows the dryline extending across the
Texas Panhandle into far eastern New Mexico and southward to the
Texas Big Bend as on 19z. Daytime heating under mostly sunny skies
has led temperatures to rise into the 80s (some mid to upper 80s
further south near the Mexico border). Satellite data shows towering
cu, mainly near and adjacent to the higher terrain of the Cap Rock
and Stockton Plateau. Morning observed soundings from AMA and LUB
would suggest that convective temperatures are around 80-85 F, which
in combination with increase in towering cu suggests initiation over
the next 1-2 hours. 

Initial development will likely be supercellular. Though flow aloft
and deep layer shear are more marginal, MLCAPE around 1500-2500 J/kg
and steep low to mid-level lapse rates will support potential for
large hail (some very large 2"+) and damaging wind. Where discrete
modes can interact with outflow/boundaries enhancing surface
vorticity, a tornado could be possible. As storms increase in
coverage this afternoon, clustering along outflows will tend to
create mixed mode of supercells and multi-cells, with an increase in
potential for damaging wind (some 70-80 mph). A watch will be needed
to cover these threats soon.

Mesoscale Discussion 0515
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0214 PM CDT Tue Apr 22 2025

Areas affected...the South Carolina and North Carolina Piedmont

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 221914Z - 222145Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Widely scattered thunderstorm activity may continue to
gradually develop and strengthen through 5-7 PM EDT, accompanied by
at least some risk for marginally severe hail and potentially
damaging surface gusts.  This may remain fairly localized and a
severe weather watch is not anticipated, but trends will continue to
be monitored.

DISCUSSION...Widely scattered thunderstorm development appears
underway, perhaps supported by subtle mid-level cooling on the
northwestern periphery of deep-layer ridging centered off the south
Atlantic coast.  Based on forecast soundings, destabilization for a
modestly moist and warming boundary layer remains inhibited by weak
high-level lapse rates.  However, CAPE within the mixed-phase layer
might still be sufficient to support small to marginally severe
hail, aided by favorable shear beneath a 40 kt southwesterly jet
streak around 500 mb.  

Lower-level wind fields will remain more modest, but with at least
some further boundary-layer destabilization through peak daytime
heating, scattered thunderstorm activity will probably continue to
intensify.  And downward mixing of momentum may lead to a few
potentially damaging wind gusts, before storms weaken this evening.

0130 PM CDT Tue Apr 22 2025

Areas affected...parts of cntrl/sern LA...srn MS...swrn/cntrl AL

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 221830Z - 222130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A gradual increase in thunderstorm activity and intensity
appears probable through 4-6 PM CDT, with short-lived stronger
storms posing a risk for locally severe hail and wind gusts.

DISCUSSION...As low-amplitude mid-level troughing and more subtle
smaller-scale perturbations progress through weak (on the order of
10-20 kt) west-southwesterly mean flow across the Gulf Coast states,
associated forcing for ascent appears likely to contribute to
increasing thunderstorm development through 21-23Z.  Inhibition for
moist boundary-layer parcels (with dew points near 70F) is becoming 
increasingly negligible with continuing insolation, with modestly
steep lower/mid-tropospheric lapse rates contributing to CAPE around
1500-2000+ J/kg.  

Despite the rather modest to weak low-level and deep-layer shear,
thunderstorms are likely to continue to slowly intensify within the
destabilizing environment, into and beyond peak daytime heating. 
Stronger updraft pulses may eventually pose increasing potential to
produce severe hail and damaging downbursts.  As convection begins
to consolidate and become more widespread, this threat should
diminish, but strengthening convective outflow may continue to pose
potential for gusty/locally damaging winds into early evening.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 159
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
315 PM CDT Tue Apr 22 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  West Texas

* Effective this Tuesday afternoon and evening from 315 PM until
  1100 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 75
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter likely
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will develop and increase in coverage
through the afternoon and evening across much of west Texas, in an
increasingly moist and unstable environment.  The strongest cells
are expected to produce large hail and damaging wind gusts.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 70
statute miles east and west of a line from 45 miles northeast of
Amarillo TX to 35 miles east of Dryden TX. For a complete depiction
of the watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS
WOU9).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 65 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
27025.

Mesoscale Discussion 0504
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0246 PM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

Areas affected...Northwest/north-central Arkansas into southern
Missouri

Concerning...Tornado Watch 154...

Valid 201946Z - 202115Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 154 continues.

SUMMARY...Storms moving into north-central Arkansas and southern
Missouri will pose a risk of tornadoes--some strong--and damaging
winds. There are signs of discrete storms within the line in
northwest/west-central Arkansas. These storms would bring the
greatest tornado risk.

DISCUSSION...KSRX radar imagery shows a few semi-discrete storms in
far western Arkansas. MRMS CAPPI data also shows these storms
intensifying. Mid-level ascent with southern extent will remain more
limited, but deep-layer shear vectors slightly more perpendicular to
the cold front will also favor discrete storms. VAD data from
KSGF/KLZK/KLSX all have shown an increase in low-level SRH over the
past couple of hours. This trend should continue, particularly in
Missouri. Supercell and QLCS tornadoes, some of which could be
strong, are all possible in this environment. Additionally, the more
linear convective elements will also pose a threat of wind damage.

Mesoscale Discussion 0502
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0220 PM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

Areas affected...Eastern Missouri into western Illinois and far
southeastern Iowa

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 201920Z - 202115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A tornado watch will be forthcoming for portions of
eastern Missouri into western Illinois and far southeastern Iowa, as
a warm frontal boundary continues to lift northward out of central
Missouri.

DISCUSSION...Breaks in cloud cover, along with a northward-lifting
surface warm frontal boundary, have resulted in continued
destabilization across eastern Missouri into western Illinois. With
mixed-layer CAPE forecast to exceed 1000 J/kg in the presence of
strong wind shear (and strong curvature of the low-level hodograph
in the vicinity of the front), the tornado threat is expected to
increase this afternoon into the evening hours. 

Ongoing storms along the MO/KS/OK borders are forecast to continue
north and east into the new watch area, with supercells embedded
within a largely linear complex. Any embedded supercells (especially
any within the vicinity of the warm front), as well as any
pre-frontal storms, will have access to an environment characterized
by strong low-level shear/streamwise vorticity supportive of tornado
development. Current VAD wind profiles from KLSX show 200 m^2/s^2 of
0-500m storm relative helicity -- nearly double what is shown in the
current SPC Mesoanalysis. Given the environmental support for
tornadoes, some of which may be strong, a tornado watch is
anticipated within the next hour or two.
