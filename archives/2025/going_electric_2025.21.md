## Opinion: it’s time to start recommending some Tesla alternatives [update]

date: 2025-05-25, from: Electrek Feed

<div class="feat-image"><img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/05/completey-different.jpg?quality=82&#038;strip=all&#038;w=1600" /></div><p>For years, Tesla has been the go-to EV recommendation for “normals” looking for a painless, low-effort experience from their first electric cars. In light of <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/04/03/tesla-cybertruck-recall-fix-joke-leaves-mark-gap/">questionable recalls</a> and its <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/05/23/tesla-ranks-under-unitedhealth-temu-bp-in-brand-reputation-poll-due-to-musk/">CEO’s recent involvement in controversial politics</a>, however, <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/03/03/tesla-owners-get-creative-to-distance-themselves-from-elon-with-new-car-logos-projectors/">people are starting to distance themselves from the trailblazing company</a>.</p>



<p>All that begs the question: <strong>what should we recommend to EV noobs now</strong>?</p>

## Tesla co-founder, Komatsu bring mobile Megawatt charging to electric job sites

date: 2025-05-25, from: Electrek Feed

<div class="feat-image"><img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/05/komatsu_mobile-charger_AI.jpg?quality=82&#038;strip=all&#038;w=1600" /></div><p>There’s no question that electric construction equipment is safer, more precise, and generally better than the diesel equipment it’s replacing, but getting power to that equipment remains a logistical challenge that hasn’t been solved for. With this new mobile Megawatt charging station, however, Komatsu think they’ve found a solution — <strong>with up to 6 MW of power</strong>!</p>
