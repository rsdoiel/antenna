was the best kind of love letter to everyone who loves anime too
much</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-25, updated: 2025-03-24, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>No one in the year of our lord 2025 is going to argue it’s easy to
make an anime. It’s perhaps a more straightforward process than it’s
ever been in human history, but the artistry and imagination of it still
requires a lot. Dive just a little bit into the background of any of
your […]</p>

<p>Shining Revelry is an upcoming expansion for Pokémon TCG Pocket. This
themed booster pack will build off the Triumphant Light expansion and

<p>Cutiefly, the bee fly Pokémon from Alola, can be found in the wild in
Pokémon Go. Yes, Cutiefly can be shiny in Pokémon Go! Neither Cutiefly
nor Ribombee see any meta use, but the fact that they’re cute little
guys makes up for this. What is the shiny rate for Cutiefly in Pokémon
Go? As […]</p>

<p>Kuji-kiri are a type of side activity in Assassin’s Creed Shadows
that are, at least in part, essential for completing Naoe’s storyline.
Kuji-kiri are spots places where Naoe meditates, and tend to be tucked
away in remote locations — which means that finding all Kuji-kiri
locations in Assassin’s Creed Shadows mandates navigating some
mountainous, uninhabited […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-03-24, updated: 2025-03-24, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Rations are functionally potions in Assassin’s Creed Shadows. You can
use them to heal yourself in combat, but in bigger areas filled with
lots of enemies, the standard allotment of rations might not feel like
enough. Lucky for you, you can increase your ration capacity, but you’ll
need to keep an eagle eye out to […]</p>

<p>Allies, which you might refer to as companions in any other game,
will fight by your side in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, continuing a
tradition you may remember from 15th-century Rome. Receiving the help of
these unique characters is not mandatory to progress in Shadows, what
you will learn — just like Naoe and Yasuke do […]</p>

<p>Nourishing extract is an ingredient in Monster Hunter Wilds that you
can use to craft other items and trade with other characters. Just like
a whole bunch of other resources in the game, you can get it by fighting
and defeating certain monsters. However, you need to know the right
monsters to take on if […]</p>

wind</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-24, updated: 2025-03-24, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>When the wind hits in Assassin’s Creed Shadows the world feels alive.
Leaves whip up into the air, grass dances back and forth, and Naoe’s
hair sways from side to side. It’s a stunning effect that enriches the
game’s shifting seasonal and weather systems. According to a Digital
Foundry interview with a few of the […]</p>

<p>“Heads Will Roll” is the final quest in the hunt for The Wounded, one
of the targets in Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ main story questline. It
ends with the assassination of Wada Koretake, and asks you to make a
choice that could potentially anger Yaya, someone you can recruit as an
ally. In this Assassin’s Creed […]</p>

character</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-23, updated: 2025-03-21, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Hunger Games series author Suzanne Collins says she’ll probably never
write a sequel to her bestselling original trilogy, which kickstarted
the YA dystopian trend of the 2010s. But she continues to write prequels
that dive into the inner machinations of the world of Panem and the
bloody competition that gave them their collective title. 2020’s […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-03-23, updated: 2025-03-21, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>“We’ve always used severance as a mechanism to look at power and to
look at control,” Severance creator Dan Erickson told me in an interview
in February. We were supposed to be talking about Irving B.’s
melon-soaked “funeral” at the time, but I couldn’t resist asking him
about the show’s intensifying power dynamics, which had […]</p>

<p>Disney’s live-action Snow White movie has nothing on the 2012
live-action Snow White films. Yes, that’s films plural, because in 2012
there was not one, but two different adaptations of the fairy tale.
Tarsem Singh’s audacious Mirror Mirror and Rupert Sanders’ indulgent,
tropey Snow White and the Huntsman both came out in 2012. They’re wildly

<p>You’re on your lunch break, or maybe you’re just bored and need
something to do for 20 minutes. That’s where short games come in.
They’re little experiences you can completely finish in a single
