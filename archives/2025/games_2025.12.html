on the Reaping adds an extra layer of tragedy to one legacy Hunger Games
character</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-23, updated: 2025-03-21, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Hunger Games series author Suzanne Collins says she’ll probably never
write a sequel to her bestselling original trilogy, which kickstarted
the YA dystopian trend of the 2010s. But she continues to write prequels
that dive into the inner machinations of the world of Panem and the
bloody competition that gave them their collective title. 2020’s […]</p>

season 2 downplayed work-life balance to focus on the true costs of
being severed</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-23, updated: 2025-03-21, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>“We’ve always used severance as a mechanism to look at power and to
look at control,” Severance creator Dan Erickson told me in an interview
in February. We were supposed to be talking about Irving B.’s
melon-soaked “funeral” at the time, but I couldn’t resist asking him
about the show’s intensifying power dynamics, which had […]</p>

remember when there were 2 live-action Snow White movies in 2012?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-23, updated: 2025-03-21, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Disney’s live-action Snow White movie has nothing on the 2012
live-action Snow White films. Yes, that’s films plural, because in 2012
there was not one, but two different adaptations of the fairy tale.
Tarsem Singh’s audacious Mirror Mirror and Rupert Sanders’ indulgent,
tropey Snow White and the Huntsman both came out in 2012. They’re wildly

<p>You’re on your lunch break, or maybe you’re just bored and need
something to do for 20 minutes. That’s where short games come in.
They’re little experiences you can completely finish in a single
sitting. Sometimes there are puzzles to solve or challenges to face, and
sometimes there aren’t. These games can be anything, really. […]</p>

<p>FFXIV patch 7.2 — the second major Dawntrail update — releases soon,
alongside a lot of content which will be spread out through several
micropatches. That said, there’ll still be stuff to do between new story
and a new raid tier right away, so don’t fret. Below, we explain when
FFXIV maintenance starts and ends, […]</p>
