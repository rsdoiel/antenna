## Insights into the protein domains of C-VI TRIM subfamily in viral infection

date: 2025-05-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins, defined by their conserved RBCC domain architecture, play key roles in various cellular processes and virus-host interactions. In this review, we focus on Class VI TRIM proteins, including TRIM24, TRIM28, and TRIM33, highlighting the distinct functional attributes of their RING, B-BOX1, B-BOX2, COILED COIL, PHD, and BRD domains in viral infection. Through multiple sequence alignment, we delineate both the conserved and divergent features within this subclass, underscoring the uniqueness of Class VI TRIM protein. Additionally, we explore the post-translational modifications (PTMs) of Class VI TRIM proteins including their functional differences in modulating viral infection. Moreover, we examine the C-VI TRIM protein complexes and their significant contributions to the antiviral response. Furthermore, we discuss small molecule ligands targeting Class VI TRIM domains, with a focus on druggable structural motifs. Understanding the multi-domain features of TRIM proteins is crucial for developing effective antiviral strategies and the therapeutic modulation of their activity.

## Ganodermataceae—current status, research, and development in Lower Mekong Basin

date: 2025-05-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The family Ganodermataceae encompasses several genera, including the widely studied Ganoderma, which is prominent in traditional medicine for its therapeutic properties. Species within this family, particularly Ganoderma lucidum, have been valued for centuries in regions such as China, Korea, and Japan for enhancing vitality, longevity, and overall health. However, the taxonomy of Ganodermataceae remains complex, with ongoing debates about species identification and classification. Members of this family are globally distributed, with the Lower Mekong Basin—comprising Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam—offering optimal conditions for their growth due to its warm, humid climate. In the Lower Mekong Basin, the species of Ganodermataceae are significant for their medicinal applications in treating conditions such as bronchitis, hepatitis, diabetes, and cancer. They also hold significant economic value, being used in products like teas, dietary supplements, and cosmetics. Ganoderma lucidum is particularly notable as a high-value market product in this region. Recent research has revealed a rich diversity of Ganodermataceae species in the region, highlighting their ecological roles, medicinal properties, and importance in plant pathology, particularly in addressing diseases in crops such as oil palm. These findings underscore the need for further research into the taxonomy, ecological functions, and potential applications of Ganodermataceae species. Advancing our understanding will support sustainable utilization, conservation efforts, and the maximization of their medicinal and commercial benefits.

## Antibiotic resistance, virulence gene, phylogenetic group and genetic diversity of Escherichia coli isolated from Tibetan pig farms in Garze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan, China

date: 2025-05-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionTo investigate the correlations among antibiotic resistance, virulence gene, phylogenetic group, and genetic diversity, providing essential data for Escherichia coli (E. coli) infection prevention and control in Tibetan pigs.MethodsA total of 244 E. coli isolates were collected. Antimicrobial susceptibility was assessed using the microdilution method. PCR was used to detect antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), virulence genes, and phylogenetic groups. Genetic diversity was analyzed using enterobacterial repetitive element sequence-based PCR. Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) 5-12, a representative strain with multidrug resistance and strong biofilm-forming ability, harboring abundant virulence genes, was selected for whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to validate PCR results.ResultsAmong the 244 isolates, 84.43% showed multidrug resistance (MDR), with the highest resistance rates for chloramphenicol (99.59%), sulfadiazine (96.31%), and sulfamethoxazole (93.85%). Twenty-five ARGs were detected, with ant(3’)-Ia, blaTEM, aac(3’)-II, floR, and qnrS exceeding 80% detection rates. Integrase genes intl1 and intl2 were found in 90.16% and 15.16% of isolates, respectively. Seventeen virulence genes were detected; bcsA (98.77%), fimC (89.75%), and agn43 (59.43%) were the most prevalent. A total of 106 virulence patterns were identified, with agn43/bcsA/fimC being predominant (17.92%). Most strains belonged to phylogenetic group A (45.90%), followed by B1 (34.43%), while 29 strains were unclassified. Sixty-four isolates were identified as diarrheagenic E. coli (DEC), predominantly enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC, 90.63%). Biofilm-forming ability was categorized as strong (4.69%), moderate (21.88%), weak (59.38%), or absent (14.06%). Clustering based on 61.2% similarity grouped the 64 DEC into five clusters, with 84.38% in cluster II, which contained all strong biofilm producers.DiscussionAntimicrobial resistance profiles of EAEC 5–12 confirmed that primarily confer resistance through antibiotic efflux, target alteration, and reduced permeability. These findings will contribute to further understanding the positive correlation between antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity in E. coli from Tibetan pig farms, shedding light on the rational use of antimicrobial agents and tackling the antibiotic resistance crisis in Tibetan pig breeding in Garze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan, China.

## Predicting ventilator-associated lower respiratory tract infection outcomes using sequencing-based early microbiological response: a proof-of-concept prospective study

date: 2025-05-12, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectivesVentilator-associated lower respiratory tract infections (VA-LRTIs) cause significant mortality. This study was assigned to explore the association between early microbiological responses defined by quantitative targeted amplicon-based next-generation sequencing (QtNGS) and clinical outcomes in patients with Acinetobacter baumannii-dominant VA-LRTI.Measurements and main resultsA prospective observational study including 34 participants was conducted to assess the probability of predicting clinical outcomes using sequencing-based early microbiological response. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) were collected at admission and 3 days post-treatment from these patients for QtNGS to determine the relative quantification ratio (RQR) of A. baumannii. Patients were categorized into survival (n=26) and non-survival (n=8) groups. The RQR was calculated as the quantification of A. baumannii determined by QtNGS after treatment to pretreatment. RQR significantly increased on day 4 in the non-survival group (median 5.285), and decreased in the survival group (median 0.1864). Receiver’s operation characteristic curves revealed that an RQR ≥1.41 was predictive of poor outcomes, with an area under the curve of 0.9471 (0.8759-1). The accuracy of the RQR determined by QtNGS was further evaluated by retesting the same specimen using digital droplet PCR, and the linear correlation was confirmed in the RQR calculated by two methods. The 23 patients with RQR<1.41 all survived for 28 days, whereas the survival rate for the 11 patients with RQR ≥1.41 was 27.27%. RQR was significantly and positively correlated with the length of ICU stay in survivors.ConclusionsThe RQR of A. baumannii detected by QtNGS correlates with the prognosis of VA-LRTI patients.
