## The role of innate immune system in respiratory viral infection related asthma

date: 2025-06-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The association between viral infections and asthma has garnered significant attention in recent years. Accumulating evidence suggests that viral infections can trigger asthma exacerbations, while asthma may also influence the susceptibility to viral infections, thereby creating a cycle of worsening symptoms and recurrent asthma attacks. Given that asthma is predominantly driven by Type 2 immune responses and viral infections are typically associated with Type 1 immune responses, the innate immune cells and cytokines that participate in both conditions appear to be the critical bridge connecting these two processes. In particular, innate immune cells play a pivotal role in modulating the immune response at the interface of viral infections and asthma. In this review, we summarize the key innate immune cells and cytokines involved in viral infections and asthma, highlighting their immunoregulatory mechanisms. We aim to provide novel perspectives and potential therapeutic directions for the clinical management of recurrent asthma attacks induced by viral infections.

## High-yield bioproduction of virus-free virus-like P4-EKORhE multi-lysin transducing particles as an antimicrobial gene therapeutic

date: 2025-06-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

A description of the construction of the bioengineered P4-EKORhE and a comprehensive method for producing very high yields (up to 1012 particles per millilitre) enable the use of virus-like particles to transduce genetically encoded antimicrobials through a combination of synthetic biology and optimised upstream and downstream processing. The final product, a gene-delivered antimicrobial in the form of the multi-lysin cassette, is fully functional before and after packaging within P4-EKORhE particles. The antimicrobial activity of the multi-lysin cassette, characterised by its lysis proteins, was tested in vivo in both pure bacterial Escherichia coli cultures and a model of phage infection in co-culture with A549 immortalised human epithelial tissue cells. This work exemplifies several bioproduction methods and demonstrates how the virology of the P4 and P2 phages can be harnessed to establish a bioprocess for producing transducing particles at very high yields, avoiding contamination by the natural virus while maintaining the antimicrobial effectiveness of the final product.

## Development and application of a curcumin-cinnamon essential oil nanoemulsion agent against mycobacteria

date: 2025-06-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

With the increasing prevalence of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis), the development of novel anti-mycobacterial agents has become urgent. In this study, a curcumin-cinnamon essential oil (Cur-CEO) nanoemulsion was developed with optimized preparation parameters, including a 10% CEO volume fraction, 7.5 minutes of ultrasonic treatment, and 350 W ultrasound power, yielding a particle size of 101.14 nm. The nanoemulsion demonstrated high encapsulation efficiency (90.2%) and stability, with a stability coefficient of 0.984. Structural analysis revealed a dense network structure of the nanoemulsion and amorphous forms of Cur and CEO, enhanced by hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, which improved solubility and bioavailability. The Cur-CEO nanoemulsion exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against mycobacteria, demonstrating MIC values of 2 µg/mL and 0.25 µg/mL against Mycobacterium smegmatis and M. tuberculosis, respectively, representing a fourfold reduction compared to the CEO solution alone, owing to its ability to induce substantial damage to mycobacterial cell membranes and consequently enhance nucleic acid and protein leakage. Furthermore, the aerosol form of the nanoemulsion effectively inhibited both surface and airborne mycobacteria, with no significant changes in structural properties post-atomization. Lung deposition studies indicated that 75.6% of aerosol particles of the nanoemulsion reached the alveolar region, suggesting its potential as an inhalation agent. Additionally, the Cur-CEO nanoemulsion exhibited negligible effects on macrophage viability, maintaining a survival rate exceeding 85% even at concentrations up to 1250 ng/mL. These findings indicate that the Cur-CEO nanoemulsion, formulated using natural ingredients, holds significant promise as a food-grade antibacterial agent for the prevention and control of mycobacterial infections.

## Aryl hydrocarbon receptor facilitates HSV-1 lytic infection by enhancing viral gene transcription and receptor expression

date: 2025-06-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a major human pathogen with significant morbidity in neonates and immunocompromised individuals. However, antiviral drugs targeting HSV-1 are emerging with antiviral resistance, highlighting the need to identify new targets for future treatment. Once HSV-1 enters the host cells, it recruits host factors to facilitate viral life cycle. In this study, we showed that aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-activated nuclear receptor, is required for HSV-1 effective replication and offers an opportunity for pharmacological intervention. Our results showed that HSV-1 infection activates AhR signaling in an interferon-dependent manner. Pharmacological inhibition or knockout of AhR reduced the expression of viral proteins and infectious progeny, while increased AhR signaling promoted the expression of viral proteins and viral replication. Mechanistically, AhR formed a transcription complex with cyclin T1, VP16 and RNA Pol II in the nucleus, bound to viral gene promoters, and promoted their transcription. Additionally, AhR promoted viral replication partially by facilitating the expression of multiple viral receptors. Collectively, AhR is a proviral host factor for HSV-1, and thus may be used as a promising host-directed antiviral target.

## SIRT7 deletion inhibits Glaesserella parasuis-mediated inflammatory responses in porcine alveolar macrophages

date: 2025-06-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Glaesserella parasuis (GPS) infection causes severe inflammatory disorder, resulting in lung injury. SIRT7 is an NAD+-dependent deacetylase known to regulate inflammatory responses, but its role in GPS infection remains unclear. Here we found that GPS infection increased SIRT7 expression and induced inflammatory responses. Deficiency of SIRT7 by CRISPR/Cas9 technology significantly inhibited GPS-induced cytopathic effects and inflammatory responses. In addition, RNA-seq analysis showed that differentially expressed genes(DEGs) induced by SIRT7 deficiency were enriched in biological processes such as cell proliferation, actin cytoskeleton formation, lipid synthesis, protein kinase activation regulation, and GTPase activity regulation. Functional enrichment analysis further indicated the involvement of these DEGs in tight junction pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, actin cytoskeleton regulation, cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, Hippo signaling pathway, and TNF signaling pathway. Finally, we identified some hub genes (GNAI3, GNAI1, JAK1, NDUFS8, CYC1) related to oxidative phosphorylation. In summary, our results demonstrate that SIRT7 is pivotal for GPS-induced inflammatory responses, which represents a promising target resistant to GPS infection.

## Periodontal disease and chronic kidney disease: mechanistic insights and novel therapeutic perspectives

date: 2025-06-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Periodontal disease (PD) is one of the most common chronic diseases of the oral cavity, and it usually refers to chronic inflammatory diseases caused by the infection of pathogenic microorganisms in the oral cavity. PD mainly affects the tissues around the teeth, causing inflammation of the gums and periodontium, destroying the alveolar bone, and even leading to tooth loosening. Many studies have shown that PD is not only limited to oral health but is also associated with diseases of multiple systems throughout the body. In recent years, more and more studies have focused on the interaction between PD and urologic diseases, especially chronic kidney disease (CKD). PD is also a typical oral disease frequently observed in patients with kidney disease. This paper reviews the potential link between PD and CKD and discusses the interaction’s pathologic mechanisms and clinical implications. In addition, this review aims to identify possible pathogenic mechanisms and suggest potential ways to target PD to prevent and treat CKD. This would lead to better treatment options to delay the progression of CKD.

## Host cellular transcriptional response to respiratory syncytial virus infection in HEp-2 cells: insights from cDNA microarray and quantitative PCR analyses

date: 2025-06-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections in young children and elderly, worldwide and poses significant risks to immunocompromised individuals. To elucidate host-virus interactions at the transcriptional level, we analyzed differential gene expression in HEp-2 cells infected with RSV using cDNA microarray analysis complemented by quantitative PCR (qPCR). HEp-2 cells were infected with RSV at a multiplicity of infection of 1, and total RNA was isolated 24 hours post-infection for gene expression profiling. Radiolabeled cDNA probes from RSV-infected and mock-infected cells were hybridized to Atlas® Human Cancer cDNA arrays, and differential gene expression was quantified by densitometry. We identified 12 host genes that were significantly upregulated in RSV-infected cells from the cDNA microarray (≥2-fold increase, P<0.01), confirmed by qPCR, encompassing functional categories including cell cycle regulation, cytoskeletal organization, apoptosis modulation, immune evasion, and inflammation. Notably, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CDKN1A was induced ~14-fold, suggesting RSV triggers a host cell cycle arrest. The intermediate filament protein, vimentin was up ~6-fold, consistent with cytoskeletal rearrangements observed during viral syncytium formation. Anti-apoptotic MCL1 increased ~11-fold, while pro-apoptotic caspase-4 showed a more modest 1.6-fold rise, indicating a complex regulation of cell death pathways. We also observed marked upregulation of a fibronectin receptor subunit (~24-fold) and complement regulatory protein CD59 (~2-fold), highlighting potential mechanisms of enhanced cell-cell fusion and viral immune evasion. The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 was elevated ~7-fold, underscoring the inflammatory response to RSV. These findings provide a global snapshot of the host transcriptomic response to RSV infection and yield insights into how RSV modulates host cellular machinery to favor viral replication and spread. Understanding these host-virus interactions may unveil novel targets for antiviral therapy and inform strategies to mitigate RSV disease pathogenesis.

## Saccharomyces boulardii and Bifidobacterium co-treatment for antibiotic associated diarrhea in pediatrics: a multicenter efficacy and safety study

date: 2025-06-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundRecent or ongoing use of antibiotics causes diarrhea. Probiotic yogurt is generally used in antibiotic-induced diarrhea as adjuvant therapy. In recent times, there have been no clear recommendations or guidelines for the course of treatment of probiotics in preventing antibiotic-induced diarrhea in infants and young children in mainland China. The objectives of the study were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Saccharomyces boulardii and Bifidobacterium in antibiotic-induced diarrhea in infants and young children in Chinese settings.MethodsData were collected retrospectively. Infants and children received antibiotic treatments with 50 g daily regular yogurt and 50 g daily regular yogurt for 7 days after those treatments (AY cohort, n = 119), or with 10 billion CFU daily Saccharomyces boulardii and 10 billion CFU daily Saccharomyces boulardii for 7 days after those treatments (AS cohort, n = 110), or with 10 billion CFU daily Bifidobacterium and 10 billion CFU daily Bifidobacterium for 7 days after those treatments (AB cohort, n = 106). Two times per day loose or watery stools were considered mild diarrhea, and three or more times per day loose or watery stools were considered severe diarrhea.ResultsAll infants and young children reported diarrhea after the start of any type of antibiotic treatment with probiotics. Time for the start of diarrhea after the start of antibiotic treatments with probiotics was higher in infants and children of the AS cohort than in infants and children of the AY [3 (4–3) days versus 1 (1–1) days, p < 0.001] and the AB [3 (4–3) days versus 2 (2–1) days, p < 0.001] cohorts. Twenty-four (20%), 11 (10%), and 17 (16%) infants and children reported any type of diarrhea in the AY, AS, and AB cohorts, respectively. The number of patients with reported diarrhea (mild and severe) and the number of patients who required extra anti-diarrheal treatments after antibiotic treatments in the AS cohort were fewer than those reported in the AY and the AB cohorts (p < 0.05 for all). Yogurt reported sneezing, runny nose, redness of the eyes, and nausea in the AY cohort (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). Saccharomyces boulardii and Bifidobacterium caused vomiting and nausea.ConclusionsAny type of antibiotic treatment cause diarrhea in infants and young children. Probiotics especially Saccharomyces boulardii co-treatments with any type of antibiotic treatment, significantly reduce incidences of diarrhea in infants and young children with manageable adverse effects.

## The apicoplast localized isocitrate dehydrogenase is needed for de novo fatty acid synthesis in the apicoplast of Toxoplasma gondii

date: 2025-06-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), an apicomplexan parasite, infects a wide range of warm-blooded animals and poses significant risks to human health. The fatty acid synthesis II (FASII) pathway in the apicoplast, which is the major source of fatty acids in parasites, is considered a potential drug target. The apicoplast also harbors some enzymes of central carbon metabolism, which are crucial for its survival, but their biological roles remain unclear. In this study, we focused on apicoplast-localized isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (ICDH1) and deleted it using CRISPR-Cas9 technology. The Δicdh1 mutant tachyzoites displayed markedly impaired growth kinetics, with further suppression under serum-deprived conditions. However, this deletion did not affect the viability or virulence of the Δicdh1 mutant in mice. NADPH, a product of ICDH1-mediated decarboxylation of isocitrate, is an essential cofactor for fatty acid synthesis. Using ¹³C6 glucose as a metabolic carbon source, we showed that the mutant strains had reduced incorporation of glucose-derived carbons into medium-chain length fatty acids (C14:0 and C16:0). Additionally, the growth of the mutant was partially restored by supplementation with exogenous C14:0 and C16:0 fatty acids. These results indicate that ICDH1 deletion affects the FASII pathway and parasite growth. Consistent with previous studies, this study confirms that T. gondii has metabolic flexibility in the apicoplast that allows it to acquire fatty acids through various pathways.

## Predictive value of blood routine-derived inflammation indexes for varicella-zoster virus meningitis in patients with acute herpes zoster

date: 2025-06-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundBlood routine-derived inflammation indexes have been studied in many diseases. However, their roles in varicella-zoster virus (VZV)-related central nervous system (CNS) infection diseases are unclear. This study analyzed the value of blood routine-derived inflammatory indexes in the diagnosis and prognosis of VZV meningitis in patients with acute herpes zoster (HZ).MethodsA total of 31 cases of VZV meningitis were selected as the research subjects, with 64 cases of acute HZ admitted to our hospital during the same period as the control group. The blood routine markers and blood routine-derived inflammatory indexes were compared between the two groups. Univariate analysis, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were used to evaluate the correlation between the levels of each inflammatory marker and the occurrence of VZV meningitis, as well as to evaluate the relationship between the inflammatory markers and the prognosis of VZV meningitis at discharge.ResultsCompared with those in the HZ group, the patients in the VZV meningitis group showed significantly increased platelet-to-lymphocyte ratios (PLRs), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios (NLRs), and systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) scores (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01), while the absolute counts of lymphocytes decreased (p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed a correlation between the PLR and the occurrence of VZV meningitis. The PLR also showed a significant correlation with the prognosis of VZV meningitis patients at discharge (r = 0.774, p < 0.01).ConclusionThe PLR, as a potential inflammatory index, may have certain clinical value in predicting the occurrence and prognosis of VZV meningitis.

## Molecular epidemiological and spatiotemporal analysis of lumpy skin disease outbreaks in cattle from Karnataka, India

date: 2025-06-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionLumpy Skin Disease (LSD), is a re-emerging transboundary disease of cattle, which has severely impacted India’s livestock population. This study investigates its molecular epidemiology, spatial patterns, and risk factors in Karnataka from 2021–2024.MethodologyIn this study, total of 1,353 different types of samples from 451 suspected LSD cases were analyzed using PCR. Spatial clustering was assessed using QGIS and GeoDa. Risk factor analysis and phylogenetic studies were performed to identify susceptible groups and viral lineages.ResultsAmong the analyzed samples, scabs showed the highest positivity rate at 83.6%, followed by nasal swabs at 80.9%, and blood samples at 76.9%, underscoring the utility of nasal swabs as a simple and effective non-invasive clinical sample for diagnosis and clinical surveillance. Spatial analysis conducted with QGIS (v3.32.2) and GeoDa (v1.22) identified strong spatial autocorrelation and consistent clustering of cases in densely populated livestock areas, driven by environmental factors and mechanical vectors, including blood-feeding arthropods like flies (Stomoxys calcitrans, Haematobia irritans) and ticks (Rhipicephalus and Amblyomma species). Vaccination campaigns achieved near 100% coverage in most districts by 2022, substantially reducing LSD-related mortality rate from 1.45% to negligible levels in 2024. Risk factor analysis identified cattle aged 1 to 5 years and females as most susceptible, with exotic breeds exhibiting 2.1–2.6 times higher odds of infection than indigenous breeds. Molecular studies unveiled a genetically stable lumpy skin disease virus strain unique to Karnataka, consistent with the low mutation rate of DNA viruses.DiscussionThese findings emphasize that, despite vaccination success, persistent hotspots and vulnerable cattle groups remain. Therefore, region-specific strategies such as targeted vector control, robust molecular surveillance, and GIS-based early outbreak alerts are necessary for LSD control in endemic regions. This study also highlights how the integration of combining molecular diagnostics, epidemiological modeling, and spatial analytics can strengthen LSD surveillance and redefine disease control strategies, ultimately mitigating its socio-economic impact.

## Specific inflammatory stimuli that engage innate immune sensors induce novel CD103 expression profiles in macrophages

date: 2025-06-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The integrin CD103 is an adhesion molecule that facilitates immune cell retention in epithelial tissues through its interaction with E-cadherin. It is a marker for certain CD8+ T-cell subpopulations and conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1), but its presence on macrophages remains poorly characterized. Macrophage differentiation is influenced by M-CSF and GM-CSF, and we investigated whether macrophages can also express CD103 under inflammatory conditions. We examined baseline CD103 expression in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) differentiated in M-CSF or GM-CSF and then stimulated them with pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or examined them following viral infection. We found that CD103 is minimally expressed at baseline but is selectively upregulated in M-CSF-differentiated macrophages after stimulation with endosomal TLR agonists. Mechanistically, p38 MAPK inhibition prevented CD103 upregulation, suggesting that this process is mediated by p38 MAPK signaling. Furthermore, in vivo LCMV infection induced CD103 expression on peritoneal macrophages. These findings demonstrate that macrophages can express CD103 under specific inflammatory conditions, challenging the assumption that CD103 is restricted to T cells and dendritic cells. This study expands our understanding of CD103 beyond its recognized roles in T cells and DCs, providing new insight into its regulation by macrophages.

## Clinical evaluation of a novel H. pylori fecal molecular diagnosis kit (multiplex RT-PCR method) for detecting clarithromycin and fluoroquinolones resistance using stool samples

date: 2025-06-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundHelicobacter pylori infection poses a significant global health challenge, exacerbated by rising antibiotic resistance. This study aimed to evaluate a novel multiplex RT-PCR-based fecal diagnostic kit (Cowin Biosciences, Jiangsu, China) for detecting mutations in the 23S rRNA and gyrA genes associated with clarithromycin and fluoroquinolone resistance in H. pylori.MethodsA total of 1,176 participants from four clinical centers in China were enrolled between August 2022 and October 2023. Phenotypic resistance was assessed on H. pylori isolated from gastric samples using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method (E-test), while fecal samples were analyzed molecularly via the diagnostic kit and Sanger sequencing. Positive (PPA), negative (NPA), and overall percentage agreement (OPA) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.ResultsThere was a high level of consistency between phenotypic testing and novel diagnostic kit. The PPA, NPA, and OPA of the fecal diagnostic kit for detecting clarithromycin susceptibility were 92.97% (CI: 90.6%-95.3%), 87.89% (CI: 85.0%-90.8%), and 90.36% (CI: 88.5%-92.3%), respectively. And likewise, the PPA, NPA, and OPA in diagnosing H. pylori resistance to fluoroquinolones were 86.85% (CI:83.6%- 90.1%), 91.12% (CI: 88.6%-93.7%), and 89.12% (CI: 87.1%-91.1%), respectively. Beyond that, the diagnostic kit also exhibited a high degree of concordance with the outcomes of Sanger sequencing. Specifically, when assessing clarithromycin resistance, the PPA, NPA, and OPA of the diagnostic kit were 97.13% (CI: 95.7%-98.6%), 94.62% (CI: 92.6%-96.6%), and 95.90% (CI: 94.7%-97.1%), respectively. Similarly, application of the diagnostic kit to detect fluoroquinolone resistance achieved a PPA of 96.92% (CI: 94.9%-98.4%), an NPA of 93.18% (CI: 91.0%-95.3%), and an OPA of 94.69% (CI: 93.3%-96.1%). The concordance rate between the fecal kit and phenotypic susceptibility testing varied with MIC values. For clarithromycin resistance, the positive percentage agreement (PPA) was lowest (89.74%) when MIC exceeded 256 µg/mL but peaked at 96.47% for MIC values between 32 and 256 µg/mL. The highest overall concordance (Kappa = 0.774) was observed at intermediate MIC levels (4–32 µg/mL), suggesting optimal detection accuracy in this range.ConclusionsThe fecal diagnostic kit provides a rapid, non-invasive, and reliable method to predict clarithromycin and fluoroquinolone resistance, supporting personalized therapy.Clinical Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT05410652.

## Epidemiology of human respiratory tract infection in Chongqing, China after COVID-19–based on surveillance data encompassing 17 respiratory pathogens

date: 2025-06-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundRespiratory tract infections (RTIs) are an important public health concern, and SARS-CoV-2 affects the epidemic pattern of RTIs globally. National multipathogenic surveillance for RTIs was conducted in mid-October 2023. However, baseline data on the pathogen spectrum of RTIs in Chongqing, China, before mid-October 2023 are limited.MethodsA descriptive analysis was conducted to determine the epidemiology of RTIs in Chongqing, China, in 2023.Results A total of 1,894 individuals were included in 2023, with an overall positivity rate of 28.7%. The highest overall positivity rate was observed in May 2023 (53.0%). Different predominant respiratory pathogens were observed among different age groups. Among all single-infected individuals, SARS-CoV-2 accounted for 32.1%, followed by IFV, which accounted for 28.2%. In the children group, RSV ranked first, accounting for 15.7%. Among school-aged children, IFV ranked the top, accounting for 46.7%. SARS-CoV-2 ranked the top among adults and the elderly, accounting for 45.5% and 47.0%, respectively.ConclusionsThe local pathogen spectrum of RTIs one year after the onset of COVID-19 showed that SARS-CoV-2 was steady, and viral infection might be the main cause of RTIs. Both upper respiratory tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections (LRIs) showed high RTI positivity rates. The pathogen spectra of upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) and LRIs differ in adults. Holistic surveillance of RTIs is necessary to estimate the local disease burden. Vaccination against respiratory infections remains an important strategy to prevent and control RTIs.

## Maternal and placental microbiome and immune crosstalk in pregnancies with small-for-gestational-age fetuses – a pilot case-control study

date: 2025-06-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionPregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction are associated with specific bacterial abundances and elevation of proinflammatory cytokines. The aim of the study was to simultaneously analyze the relation between the gut and placenta microbiome and cytokine profile in pregnant women with fetuses appropriate (AGA) and small for gestational age (SGA).Material and methodsWomen with singleton pregnancies at or beyond 32 weeks of gestation were recruited. 11 delivered SGA newborns (study group) and 11 AGA newborns (control group). Samples of maternal venous blood, stool and placenta were collected perinatally.ResultsIn SGA group lower Chao index in placental samples collected from maternal side, while higher Chao index in placental samples collected from fetal side were observed. Taxonomic analysis identified four significantly less abundant genera in samples collected from maternal side. No taxa remained significant after correction in samples from fetal side, but several taxa showed trends of differing abundance. Veillonella showed a trend toward higher abundance in stool samples in SGA group, while other taxa were significant only at a lower threshold. Metabolite analysis revealed that hexanoic acid was significantly elevated compound in the stool of women from the SGA group. Proteobacteria unclassified and Halomonadaceae correlated with stool metabolites, while IL-6 and TNF-α correlated with specific bacterial groups.ConclusionsSpecific changes in the gut microbiome and metabolome as well as placenta microbiome of women with SGA have been observed, with additional associations with inflammatory cytokine levels, suggesting a potential role of these factors in SGA development and highlighting the need for further research.

## Advancing periodontitis microbiome research: integrating design, analysis, and technology

date: 2025-06-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease affecting 20%-50% of adults worldwide, is driven by polymicrobial synergy and dysbiosis. Despite numerous studies on the oral microbiota in periodontitis, significant heterogeneity exists between findings, posing challenges for treatment strategies. To understand the sources of this variability and establish standardized protocols, we reviewed the literature to identify potential factors contributing to these discrepancies. We found most studies focus on microbial communities in periodontal pockets, with fewer investigating microbial composition within gingival tissue. Research indicates that bacterial communities in gingival tissue exist as biofilms, potentially serving as reservoirs for persistent infection. Therefore, further exploration of the microbiome within periodontal tissues is needed, which may offer new insights for treatment strategies. Metatranscriptomics provides valuable insights into gene expression patterns of the oral microbiota, enabling the exploration of microbial activity at a functional level. Previous studies revealed that most upregulated virulence factors in periodontitis originate from species not traditionally considered major periodontal pathogens. However, current studies have not fully identified or revealed the functional changes in key symbiotic microbes in periodontitis. We reviewed the analytical paradigms of metatranscriptomics and found that current analysis is largely limited to assessing functional changes in known periodontal pathogens, highlighting the need for a functional-driven approach. Beyond the limitations of current analytical paradigms, the metatranscriptomics also has inherent constraints. We suggested integrating emerging high-throughput microbial sequencing technologies with functional-driven analytical strategies to provide a more comprehensive and higher-resolution insight for microbiome reconstruction in periodontitis.

## A rare Wohlfahrtiimonas strain linked to human infection

date: 2025-06-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Wohlfahrtiimonas is an infrequently encountered Gram-negative bacterium capable of infecting humans and, in severe instances, precipitating sepsis. Presently, three species within the Wohlfahrtiimonas genus have been identified, with Wohlfahrtiimonas chitiniclastica being the sole species implicated in human infections. To date, there has been only one documented case of human infection with W. chitiniclastica in China. In this study, we present an additional case of human infection with a Wohlfahrtiimonas species. Notably, through 16S rRNA gene sequencing and whole-genome sequencing, the strain was identified as an unclassified species closely related to W. chitiniclastica DSM 18708T.

## The impact of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid metagenomics next-generation sequencing on the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected pulmonary infection

date: 2025-06-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectivesThis study aimed to enhance the comprehension of the practical utility of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in the clinical management of patients with suspected pneumonia.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 296 individuals who underwent BALF mNGS and conventional microbial tests (CMTs) for suspected pneumonia. We compared the clinical characteristics between patients with pulmonary infection (PI) and those without pulmonary infection (NPI). The detection rate of mNGS and CMTs in different groups of patients were compared. The Sankey diagram was used to present the results of the influence of mNGS on diagnosis and treatment.ResultsComparison between PI and NPI showed that individuals with fever, concurrent malignant tumors, consolidation or ground-glass opacity on chest CT(Computed tomography) images, and elevated inflammatory markers on blood tests were more likely to develop lung infections. Analysis of the rate of positive detection between CMTs and mNGS in various subgroups revealed that mNGS had a significantly higher positive detection rate in patients with pulmonary infections (87.95% vs. 71.06%, p<0.001), in immunocompetent patients (86.91% vs. 68.08%, p<0.001), and in patients with malignant tumors (92.31% vs. 69.23%, p=0.035). Furthermore, mNGS helped initiate appropriate antibiotic treatment and confirmed the effectiveness of empirical treatment. Compared to immunocompetent patients, BALF mNGS in immunocompromised individuals with suspected lung infections yielded higher rates of accurate diagnosis (62.86% vs. 42.79%, p = 0.027) and more effective treatment (71.43% vs. 58.56%, p = 0.148).ConclusionsBALF mNGS identified a greater variety of pathogens than CMTs. Immunocompromised patients with suspected pneumonia may benefit more from BALF mNGS.

## The regulation of neuroinflammatory response after stroke by intestinal flora microorganisms

date: 2025-06-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Ischemic stroke (IS) is a severe central nervous system disorder characterized by high incidence, disability, mortality, and recurrence rates, along with numerous complications. The microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) represents a bidirectional communication pathway between the brain and the gut, which can influence the onset and progression of IS through neural, immunoregulatory, and gut metabolite pathways. Recent preclinical and clinical evidence supports the use of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), probiotics and prebiotics, dietary interventions, and antibiotics as strategies to suppress neuroinflammation in IS, protect the blood-brain barrier, modulate immune responses, and improve stroke outcomes. In this review, we summarize the manifestations of innate inflammation and adaptive immunity following the onset of IS, highlight the interactions between the MGBA and post-stroke neuroinflammation, and discuss current therapeutic measures, thus providing insights for the development of novel treatment strategies in the future.

## Tinea capitis in Hainan: a prospective study

date: 2025-06-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveTinea capitis, a chronic inflammatory disease of the scalp and hair shafts caused by dermatophyte infections, ​manifests clinically​ as erythematous lesions, scaling, alopecia, and pustule formation. Hainan, a tropical island province in China, exhibits distinctive climatic conditions and demographic contact patterns that ​could shape​ its pathogen spectrum. However, comprehensive epidemiological data ​remain scarce. This study ​analyzes​ the epidemiological characteristics and pathogen spectrum of tinea capitis in Hainan, China.MethodsThis study ​was undertaken​ across 11 coastal and inland dermatological centers in Hainan Province (January 2023 to December 2024). A total of 76 tinea capitis patients ​diagnosed​ via mycological examination (fungal fluorescence microscopy, fungal culture with species identification) ​and corroborated​ by dermatoscopic evaluation ​were consecutively enrolled. Data on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and clinical manifestations ​were systematically collated​ using standardized case report forms. Pathogen subtyping ​was performed via​ integrated morphological identification ​supplemented by​ molecular biological analysis of the ITS region.ResultsAmong 76 enrolled patients, minors (≤15 years) ​accounted for​ 80.26% (61/76), with ≤10-year-olds ​representing​ 91.8% (56/61) of pediatric cases. The overall male-to-female ratio ​was recorded as​ 1:1.05 (37 males vs. 39 females), while pediatric patients (≤15 years) ​exhibited​ a 1.07:1 ratio (31 males vs. 29 females). Animal contact history ​was reported in​ 31 cases (40.79%), scalp trauma in 3 cases (3.95%), and co-occurring superficial fungal infections in 12 cases (15.79%). ​Fungal elements were detected​ via direct microscopic examination in 64 cases (84.21%). Fungal cultures ​obtained​ 45 positive isolates (19 strains in 2023, 26 in 2024), with kerion (inflammatory tinea capitis) ​exhibiting​ the highest culture positivity rate, followed by tinea alba. ​The primary pathogens identified​ were zoophilic Microsporum canis (M. canis) (20 cases, 43.79%) and anthropophilic Trichophyton rubrum (T. rubrum) (9 strains, 19.57%). Clinical manifestations ​comprised​ kerion (44 cases, 57.89%), tinea alba (27 cases, 35.53%), and black dot tinea (5 cases, 6.58%). Kerion cases ​were predominantly linked to​ M. canis and T. mentagrophytes (interdigital subtype), whereas tinea alba ​demonstrated​ infections by M. canis and T. rubrum. Black dot lesions ​were additionally observed​ in M. canis infections.ConclusionThe primary affected group is children ≤10 years old, with the most common pathogenic fungus being zoophilic M. canis, and clinical classification is predominantly kerion. Dermatologists should pay attention to different transmission routes and pathogen spectra.

## Identifying bacterial and fungal communities associated with Fusarium-wilt symptomatic and non-symptomatic ‘Gros Michel’ banana plants in Ecuador

date: 2025-06-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Fusarium wilt of banana (FWB), caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc), remains a critical threat to banana production worldwide. Despite the persistence of the disease in fields planted with susceptible cultivars such as ‘Gros Michel’, little is known about the microbial interactions influencing symptom development. In this study, we assessed the bacterial and fungal communities associated to symptomatic and non-symptomatic ‘Gros Michel’ bananas plants sampled in Ecuador banana fields affected by Foc race 1. We aimed to compare their diversity, composition, and to identify potential microbial taxa that could be active in disease suppression. Samples were collected from the pseudostem, rhizome, and rhizosphere, and analyzed through high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA and ITS2 regions to characterize bacterial and fungal communities, respectively. Results revealed that non-symptomatic plants harbored significantly higher bacterial diversity, particularly in pseudostem and rhizome tissues, compared to symptomatic plants. Genera including, Bacillus, Enterobacter, Paenibacillus, Pectobacterium, Herbaspirillum and Pseudomonas were enriched in non-symptomatic tissues, suggesting a potential role in disease suppression. In contrast, symptomatic plants showed an increased abundance of genera such as Klebsiella and Kosakonia. Fungal community shifts were less pronounced, indicating that bacterial dynamics may play a more critical role in disease development. These findings shed light on the key microbial taxa associated with FWB-affected banana plants and the potential role of their microbiome to plant health and disease suppression.
