## I tried taking a tiny e-bike kayak-camping on a deserted island. Here’s what happened

<div class="feat-image"><img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/04/kayak-ebike-header.jpg?quality=82&#038;strip=all&#038;w=1600" /></div><p>When I first looked at the <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=9bf363e8-95c7-41cf-b1e5-fa19bcbaab31&amp;website_id=d8cb501a-c5ae-4e37-bc97-8c54add0467e&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fjackrabbit.bike%2Fproducts%2Fjackrabbit-xg-pro-green%3Fvariant%3D50117478351016">JackRabbit XG Pro</a>, my instinct was to take it somewhere wild. Sure, it’s designed to be a compact, fun-sized ride for urban zipping and off-road excursions — but what if I took it even further? What if I used it to tow a kayak… to the beach… and then paddled that kayak with the e-bike strapped to it to a deserted island to go camping?</p>



<p>Sometimes bad ideas turn into great stories. This was one of those.</p>
