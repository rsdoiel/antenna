## Google is a monopolist in online advertising tech, judge says

date: 2025-04-17, from: OS News

Google acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in some online advertising technology, a federal judge ruled on Thursday, adding to legal troubles that could reshape the $1.86 trillion company and alter its power over the internet. Judge Leonie Brinkema of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia said in a 115-page ruling that Google had broken the law to build its dominance over the largely invisible system of technology that places advertisements on pages across the web. The Justice Department and a group of states had sued Google, arguing that its monopoly in ad technology allowed the company to charge higher prices and take a bigger portion of each sale. ↫ David McCabe at The New York Times Google has come under fire from all sides in the United States, being declared an abusive monopoly in two different court cases covering search and now online advertising. In this case, Google controls 87% of the online advertising market in the US, which clearly confers monopoly power onto the company. No actual remedies have been proposed yet in this case, though, but breaking up the company is on the table. Google isn&#8217;t the only company facing antitrust court cases in the US, as Amazon and Apple, too, have the US government breathing down their necks. All three of these companies have overtly been trying to buy the favour of the new regime in Washington, but so far, without any success. I doubt we&#8217;ll get as far as a breakup, but I definitely think that&#8217;s the only real way we&#8217;ll ever get proper market forces at work again in the technology market. Not that any of us are really &#8220;consumers&#8221; in this online ad business, but of course, monopoly pricing still affects us through higher prices for the goods being advertised. If companies are forced to accept Google&#8217;s higher pricing for online ads, those costs will definitely be offloaded to consumers. As such, even breaking up a monopoly that doesn&#8217;t seem to affect us personally can still improve our lives by lowering prices.

## ActiveX disabled by default in Microsoft 365

date: 2025-04-17, from: OS News

ActiveX is a powerful technology that enables rich interactions within Microsoft 365 applications, but its deep access to system resources also increases security risks. Starting this month, the Windows versions of Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, and Microsoft Visio will have a new default configuration for ActiveX controls: Disable all controls without notification. ↫ Zaeem Patel at the Microsoft 365 Insider Blog Be honest: did any of you know ActiveX was still a thing? Heck, when was the last time you even thought of ActiveX? This technology acted a replacement for Windows&#8217; COM and OLE 2.0, and was used to make controls in a whole slew of Microsoft applications. ActiveX controls from one application could also be embedded into another, like showing a toolbar from Word inside an image editor. ActiveX has several major downsides, the two biggest of which are its relative lack of portability, and most of all, its atrocious security record. I&#8217;m genuinely surprised it&#8217;s taken them this long to actively, fully disable the technology by default.

## A threat model for opposing authoritarianism

date: 2025-04-17, from: OS News

A decade ago, I published a book on privacy “Dragnet Nation: A Quest for Privacy, Security, and Freedom in a World of Relentless Surveillance.” In the book, and since then, in articles and speeches, I have been dispensing advice to people on how to protect their privacy. But my advice did not envision the moment we are in – where the government would collaborate with a tech CEO to strip-mine all of our data from government databases and use it to pursue political enemies. In the parlance of cybersecurity, I had the wrong “threat model,” which is a fancy way of describing the risks I was seeking to mitigate. I had not considered that the United States might be swept into the rising tide of what scholars call “competitive authoritarianism” – authoritarian regimes that retain some of the trappings of democracy, such as elections, but use the power of the state to crush any meaningful dissent. ↫ Julia Angwin Democracy is not nearly as much of a given as many people think, and in this day and age, where massive amounts of Americans&#8217; data and personal information are collected and stored by the very corporations supporting the Trump regime, Americans have to think very differently about where digital threats actually come from. Nothing protects any American &#8211; or anyone visiting America &#8211; from ending up in an El Salvadorian concentration camp. Plan accordingly.

## Fedora 42 released

date: 2025-04-15, from: OS News

Fedora 42 has been released, bringing with it a major policy change: the Fedora KDE version now has the same status as the GNOME version. This means that Fedora KDE will be getting the same promotion, website space, and potential blocker status as the GNOME version. For now, the naming is a bit weird &#8211; Fedora Workstation for GNOME, Fedora KDE Plasma Desktop for KDE &#8211; but they intend to fix this down the line. Feodra 42 also brings with it a brand new installation interface, which replaces the old one with a newer, step-by-step wizard-style interface. Anaconda is now also a native Wayland application, instead of running in Xorg. This release also marks the official availability of the Fedora COSMIC spin, bringing System76&#8217;s Rust-based COSMIC desktop on the same footing as Xfce, LXQt, and others. Another cool addition is FEX for those of us running Fedora on ARM. Fedora now provides FEX, a fast emulator that allows one to run x86 and x86-64 binaries on an AArch64 Linux host. FEX requires a number of supporting components, including a RootFS image, and integration with muvm to support 16k page-size hosts. The purpose of this Change is to integrate FEX itself and its supporting components into Fedora Linux, to provide a delightful out-of-box experience for users that want to run x86 and x86-64 binaries on their aarch64 systems. This also includes integration into the AArch64 Fedora KDE spin as a non-blocking component of the spin. ↫ Fedora 42 release notes You can download and install Fedora 42, or if you&#8217;re already a Fedora user, you can upgrade through your graphical update utility or the command line using DNF.

## Whiskey developer throws in the towel, suggests to just buy CrossOver instead

date: 2025-04-15, from: OS News

Isaac Marovitz, the developer of Whiskey, a frontend for Apple&#8217;s Game Porting Toolkit and Wine, has decided to throw in the towel. The developer is advising users to buy CrossOver instead, which provides the same service. The reasoning behind their decision seems sound, and are actually quite noble and considerate. First and foremost, it&#8217;s the usual problem lone developers run into: they lost interest in the project, and to make matters worse, they&#8217;re only a student and simply lack the time to keep working on a project they&#8217;re simply not really into anymore. Running a complicated project like this on your own, unpaid, while also having to study is hard at the best of times, and if you&#8217;re also not interested in it anymore it quickly becomes a massive burden. The second reason is that originally, Whiskey was just supposed to be a frontend for Wine on the Mac, without actually making any changes to Wine itself. The release of Apple&#8217;s Game Porting Toolkit changed the game, though, and all of a sudden Whiskey ended up shipping not just a nice frontend, but also custom versions of Wine. Marovitz states he doesn&#8217;t have the required knowledge and expertise to work on Wine, and as such, can&#8217;t contribute back to Wine and CrossOver, which feels bad. By contrast, Whisky is based on CrossOver, but we don&#8217;t produce any bespoke fixes. I, quite frankly, do not have the requisite skills or time to do so. As a result, the amount that Whisky as a whole contributes to Wine is practically zero. This is not a fair trade, and continuing this parasitic relationship could easily harm CrossOver&#8217;s continued profitability and the existence of Wine on Mac as a whole. ↫ Isaac Marovitz Wine, of course, has a ton of funding behind it these days, especially from Valve, but Valve&#8217;s interest lies solely and exclusively on Linux. While all of Valve&#8217;s funds and the work of Wine developers does benefit the Mac, much of the Wine on Mac work is done by CrossOver. I find it incredibly honest and respectful of Marovitz to make it clear he doesn&#8217;t want to leech off other people&#8217;s work without providing anything in return. So, Whiskey is no more, but for the few Mac users who want to play Windows games on their Mac, CrossOver exists as a refuge that should work just fine.

## Why is there a “small house” in IBM’s Code Page 437?

date: 2025-04-14, from: OS News

There&#8217;s a small house ( ⌂ ) in the middle of IBM&#8217;s infamous character set Code Page 437. &#8220;Small house&#8221;—that&#8217;s the official IBM name given to the glyph at code position 0x7F, where a control character for &#8220;Delete&#8221; (DEL) should logically exist. It&#8217;s cute, but a little strange. I wonder, how did it get there? Why did IBM represent DEL as a house, of all things? ↫ Heikki Lotvonen Don&#8217;t waste any time here, and go read the article. It&#8217;s immediately become one of my favourite reads of all time.

## Fedora change aims for 99% package reproducibility

date: 2025-04-14, from: OS News

The effort to ensure that open-source software is reproducible has been gathering steam over the years, and gaining traction with major Linux distributions. Debian, for example, has been working toward reproducible builds for more than a decade; it can now produce official live CDs of the current stable release that are reproducible. Fedora started on the path much later, but it has progressed far enough that the project is now considering a change proposal for the Fedora 43 development cycle, expected to be released in October, with a goal of making 99% of Fedora&#8217;s package builds reproducible. So far, reaction to the proposal seems favorable and focused primarily on how to achieve the goal—with minimal pain for packagers—rather than whether to attempt it. ↫ Joe Brockmeier at LWN.net In the case of individual packages, reproducibility means that if you set up a build environment at home according to Fedora&#8217;s specifications, you can create an exact, bit-by-bit identical copy of a package. This is important because it can help detect and guard against supply chain attacks like the infamous xz backdoor attempt that was thwarted only by mere luck. As the LWN article notes, however, it&#8217;s impossible for Fedora to achieve the original &#8220;bit-by-bit&#8221; part of the definition because of how RPMs are built. RPMs include the signature inside the RPM, and a few other metadata bits are problematic as well. The actual contents of an RPM &#8211; the thing you actually install, run, and use &#8211; meet the definition of &#8220;bit-by-bit&#8221;, though. By this point, Fedora has pretty much done all it can through its own infrastructure when it comes to reproducibility, which has brought the project to 90% of packages being reproducible. It&#8217;s going to be up to the individual package maintainers and software developers to get to the desired goal of 99% by Fedora 43, though. To ensure package maintainers take this issue seriously, a change proposal has been proposed to treat reproducibility issues as bugs, with a degree of wiggle room for now (think should instead of must). It&#8217;s only a proposal for now, but it&#8217;s looking like it will make it. The excellent &#8211; as always &#8211; LWN article has a lot more detail about both the proposes changes as well as the various points of view.

## “I bought a Mac”

date: 2025-04-14, from: OS News

Yep. I regret to inform you all that, as of January 2025, I am a Mac user: I bought a Mac. I have betrayed the penguin.  So, how did such an icon of early 2000s Apple fall into my grubby hands? Well, it all started with the Wii U. I’m not joking. ↫ Loganius That&#8217;s one heck of an excuse to get a PowerPC G4 &#8211; needing to do Linux kvm hacking to fix a bug. While getting the PowerMac G4 they bought all set up and working properly for development purposes, someone else fixed the bug in question in the meantime. Such is the way of open source development. Regardless, as far as classic computers go, PowerPC Macs are a great way to enter the wider hobby of retrocomputing. They&#8217;re widely available, incredibly cheap, and offer a ton of variety when it comes to supported operating systems, working with everything from classic Mac OS to Mac OS X, from Linux to the BSDs, down to more exotic awesome stuff like MorphOS. Their popularity also ensures a steady stream of replacement parts, expertise, and community support. I have a 1.25Ghz 17&#8243; PowerBook G4 for MorphOS, and a snow white iBook G3 for Mac OS 9.2.2, and I&#8217;ll never get rid of them.

## The subjective charms of Objective-C

date: 2025-04-14, from: OS News

To argue that Objective-C resembles a metaphysically divine language, or even a good language, is like saying Shakespeare is best appreciated in pig latin. Objective-C is, at best, polarizing. Ridiculed for its unrelenting verbosity and peculiar square brackets, it is used only for building Mac and iPhone apps and would have faded into obscurity in the early 1990s had it not been for an unlikely quirk of history. Nevertheless, in my time working as a software engineer in San Francisco in the early 2010s, I repeatedly found myself at dive bars in SoMa or in the comments of HackerNews defending its most cumbersome design choices. ↫ Gabriel Nicholas at Wired I&#8217;ll just step back and let y&#8217;all handle this one.
