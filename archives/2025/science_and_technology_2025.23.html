<h2 id="apple-introduces-new-liquid-glass-design-language">Apple
introduces new Liquid Glass design language</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Apple at WWDC announced iOS 26, introducing a comprehensive visual
redesign built around its new “Liquid Glass” concept, alongside expanded
Apple Intelligence capabilities, updates to core communication apps, and
more. Liquid Glass is a translucent material that reflects and refracts
surroundings to create dynamic, responsive interface elements, according
to Apple. The new design language transforms the Lock Screen, where the
time fluidly adapts to available space in wallpapers, and spatial scenes
add 3D effects when users move their iPhone. Meanwhile, app icons and
widgets gain new customization options, including a striking clear
appearance. ↫ Tim Hardwick at MacRumors Apple also posted a video on
YouTube where you can see the new design language in motion, which gives
a bit of a better idea of what it’s actually like. Of course, before you
believe anyone who’s writing about this new Liquid Glass design
language, the only true way to form a coherent opinion of a user
interface is through usage, so keep that in mind. Looking at the video,
the good part that immediately jumps out at me about this Liquid Glass
stuff is the animations informing you where stuff is coming from and
where it’s going. These are the sort of affordances I was writing about
almost 20 years ago, when Compiz’ animations and effects made windows
and virtual desktops feel like “real” objects that had a physical
presence in a space. Apple’s Liquid Glass seems to have the same effect,
and I’m here for it. The transparency, though, I’m not a huge fan of.
Depending on the content shown beneath the glass user interface
elements, contrast can suffer, making things incredibly hard to read.
While the glassy refraction effects looks neat, I would’ve much rather
seen a focus on blurred glass, which makes a lack of contrast much less
likely to occur. I think we’re going to be seeing a lot of screenshots,
videos, and thinkpieces about how this much transparency is going to
hurt readability. I love it when an operating system gets a design
language overhaul, and in this case, Apple is applying it across the
board, to all of its operating systems. This may be the perfect moment
for me to grit my teeth, hold my nose, and get my hands on a Mac just so
I can write about Liquid Glass once it lands.</p>

<h2 id="windows-7-a-2025-perspective-rose-tinted-or-not">Windows 7: a
2025 perspective (rose-tinted or not)</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Quite often, I wonder how much nostalgia plays part in our perception
of past events. Luckily, with software, you can go “back” and retest it,
and so there’s no need for any illusions and misconceptions. To wit, I
decided to reinstall and try Windows 7 again (as a virtual machine, but
still), to see whether my impressions of the dross we call “modern”
software today are justified. ↫ Igor Ljubuncic The conclusion is that,
yes, you can still get quite far today with Windows 7, and I honestly
don’t fault anyone for longing for those days. Windows 7 sits dead smack
in the middle between the dreadfulness of Windows XP and pre-patches
Vista on one extreme, and the ad-infested, “AI”-slop that are Windows 10
and 11. Its Aero look also happens to be experiencing somewhat of a
revival, with both Apple and Google borrowing heavily from it for their
latest software releases. Transparent blurred glass is making a
comeback, but I doubt the current crop of designers at Apple and Google
will be able to top just how nice Aero Glass looked in Windows 7. Still,
I don’t think you should be using an out-of-support version of Windows
for anything more than retrocomputing and as a curiosity, for obvious
reasons we’re all aware of. With the end of support for Windows 10 –
still used by two-thirds of Window users – approaching quickly, a lot of
people are going to have to make the same choice that fans of Windows 7
made years ago: keep using what I like, risks and all, or move on to
what I don’t like, but is at least maintained and supported? That is,
assuming you can even make that choice in the first place, since in the
current economic uncertainty, most definitely cannot. Maybe the Windows
world will dodge a bullet, and the circumstances force Microsoft to
extend support for Windows 10, like they did with Office applications.
Let’s see if they blink, again.</p>
