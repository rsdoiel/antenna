OS: experimental operating system fully written in Rust as an EFI

<p>date: 2025-06-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>And I’ve got another custom hobby operating system for you today:
Munal OS. An experimental operating system fully written in Rust, with a
unikernel design, cooperative scheduling and a security model based on
WASM sandboxing. ↫ Munal OS GitHub page Munal OS has no bootloader, but
is instead compiled into a single EFI binary that contains all it needs
to function, including a few applications. Since Munal OS relies on a
PCI driver that communicates with QEMU via the VirtIO 1.1 specification
for things like input and graphics, it can’t yet run on real hardware.
It has its own UI toolkit, and comes with applications like a basic web
browser, a text editor, and a Python terminal.</p>

<p>Xeneva is an operating system for both x86_64 and ARM64

with hybrid kernel design and the entire operating system is known as
‘Xeneva’. ↫ XenevaOS GitHub page It’s remarkably complete, with driver
loading and linking, up to SSE 3 support, USB3 and Intel HD audio
support, networking, and a whole lot more of the basics that make up a
modern complete operating system. On top of all this, it also has a
compositing window manager, a desktop environment, a terminal with VT100
support, Freetype2 font rendering, and much more. It also comes with a
few basic applications like a file manager, calculator, audio player,
and so on. It’s written in C (and some C++), and uniquely, can only be
built in a Windows environment, something you don’t see very often. It
definitely looks quite impressive.</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today, we’re bringing you Android 16, rolling out first to supported
Pixel devices with more phone brands to come later this year. This is
the earliest Android has launched a major release in the last few years,
which ensures you get the latest updates as soon as possible on your
devices. Android 16 lays the foundation for our new Material 3
Expressive design, with features that make Android more accessible and
easy to use. ↫ Seang Chau at the Google blog Android 16 doesn’t seem
like a very big release, and that’s because for most users, it really
isn’t. There’s some neat features in here, like improved notification
grouping, live notifications, a slew of protection features for people
who run increased risk (think journalists or victims of abuse), and
proper desktop-style windowing on tablets, which seems like the tentpole
feature for now. The Material 3 Expressive design is not really here
yet, though as that will come in subsequent Android 16 updates. The
release for devices coincides with the release of the source code, which
is no longer released as part of the development process, but dumped
across the fence at release time. This means that those of us using a
de-Googled Android ROM – I use GrapheneOS – will have to wait a bit
longer than we’re used to before getting the new version.</p>

id="apple-releases-containerization-a-swift-package-for-running-linux-containers-on-macos">Apple
releases Containerization, a Swift package for running Linux containers
on macOS</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>As part of its WWDC announcements, Apple has unveiled
Containerization, which uses macOS’ virtualisation framework to run
Linux containers on Apple Silicon Macs. Containerization executes each
Linux container inside of its own lightweight virtual machine. Clients
can create dedicated IP addresses for every container to remove the need
for individual port forwarding. Containers achieve sub-second start
times using an optimized Linux kernel configuration and a minimal root
filesystem with a lightweight init system. vminitd is a small init
system, which is a subproject within Containerization. vminitd is
spawned as the initial process inside of the virtual machine and
provides a GRPC API over vsock. The API allows the runtime environment
to be configured and containerized processes to be launched. vminitd
provides I/O, signals, and events to the calling process when a process
is ran. ↫ Containerization GitHub page Alongside this new tool, Apple
also released container, which creates and runs OCI-compliant container
images. Yes, both of these names are horribly generic and are definitely
going to lead to confusion in online discussions and writing, but the
tools themselves seem quite nice. People stuck on macOS who need to do
Linux work can now easily get their work done on macOS – if you’re okay
with using Electron for developers, of course, which is what containers
really are. Clearly, nobody can ignore Linux, not even Apple or
Microsoft.</p>

menu bar, and background processes come to iPadOS</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>For years now – it feels more like decades, honestly – Apple has been
trying a variety of approaches to make the iPad more friendly to power
users, most notably by introducing, and subsequently abandoning, various
multitasking models. After its most recent attempts – Stage Manager –
fell on deaf ears, the company has thrown its hands up in the air and
just implemented what we all wanted on the iPad anyway: a normal
windowing environment. Apple today revealed an overhaul of iPad
multitasking, introducing a completely new windowing system, a
macOS-style Menu Bar, a pointer, and more. The centerpiece of the
multitasking improvements is a new macOS-style windowing system. Apps
still launch in full-screen by default, preserving the familiar ‌iPad‌
experience, but users can now resize apps into windows using a new grab
handle. If an app was previously used in a windowed state, it will
remember that layout and reopen the same way next time. ↫ Hartley
Charlton at MacRumors The new window manager includes tiling features,
Exposé, support for multiple displays, and swiping twice on the home
button will minimise all open windows. It’s literally the macOS way of
managing windows transplanted onto the iPad, with some small affordances
for touch input. This is excellent news, and should make the
multitasking features of the iPad, which, at this point, is as powerful
as a MacBook, much more accessible and effortless than all those hidden
gesture-based features from before. The amount of RAM in your iPad seems
to determine how many active windows you can have open before the older
ones get put to sleep, from four on the oldest iPad Pro models, to many
more on the most recent models. Any windows above that limit will still
be visible, but will just be a screenshot of their most recent state
until you interact with them again. Any windows above a limit of twelve
will be pushed to the recents screen instead. In addition, and almost
just as important, iPadOS 26 also introduces proper background
processes, allowing applications to actually keep running in the
background instead of being put to sleep. Anyone who has ever done any
serious work on an iPad that involves long processes like exporting a
video will consider this a godsend. Now all we need is a proper terminal
and Xcode and the iPad can be a real computer.</p>

tales of that time when I sold out to Google’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>If you ever wanted to know what it was like to be an engineer at
Google during the early to late 2000s, here you go. Now even though
Google is fundamentally a spyware advertising company (some 80% of its
revenue is advertising; the proportion was even higher back then), we
Engineers were kept carefully away from that reality, as much as meat
eaters are kept away from videos of the meat industry: don’t think about
it, just enjoy your steak. If you think about it it will stop being
enjoyable, so we just churned along, pretending to work for an
engineering company rather than for a giant machine with the sole goal
of manipulating people into buying cruft. The ads and business teams
were on different floors, and we never talked to them. ↫ Elilla Even
back then, Google knew full well that what they were doing and working
towards was deeply problematic and ethically dubious, at best, and
reading about how young, impressionable Google engineers at the time
figured that out by themselves is kind of heartbreaking. In those days,
Google tried really hard to cultivate an image of being different than
Apple or Microsoft, a place where employees were treated better and had
more freedom, working for a company trying to make the web a better
place. Of course, none of that was actually true, but for a short while
back then, a lot of people fell for it – yes, including you, even if you
now say you didn’t – and reading about the experiences from people on
the inside at the time, it was never actually true.</p>

<h2 id="apple-introduces-new-liquid-glass-design-language">Apple
introduces new Liquid Glass design language</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Apple at WWDC announced iOS 26, introducing a comprehensive visual
redesign built around its new “Liquid Glass” concept, alongside expanded
Apple Intelligence capabilities, updates to core communication apps, and
more. Liquid Glass is a translucent material that reflects and refracts
surroundings to create dynamic, responsive interface elements, according
to Apple. The new design language transforms the Lock Screen, where the
time fluidly adapts to available space in wallpapers, and spatial scenes
add 3D effects when users move their iPhone. Meanwhile, app icons and
widgets gain new customization options, including a striking clear
appearance. ↫ Tim Hardwick at MacRumors Apple also posted a video on
YouTube where you can see the new design language in motion, which gives
a bit of a better idea of what it’s actually like. Of course, before you
believe anyone who’s writing about this new Liquid Glass design
language, the only true way to form a coherent opinion of a user
interface is through usage, so keep that in mind. Looking at the video,
the good part that immediately jumps out at me about this Liquid Glass
stuff is the animations informing you where stuff is coming from and
where it’s going. These are the sort of affordances I was writing about
almost 20 years ago, when Compiz’ animations and effects made windows
and virtual desktops feel like “real” objects that had a physical
presence in a space. Apple’s Liquid Glass seems to have the same effect,
and I’m here for it. The transparency, though, I’m not a huge fan of.
Depending on the content shown beneath the glass user interface
elements, contrast can suffer, making things incredibly hard to read.
While the glassy refraction effects looks neat, I would’ve much rather
seen a focus on blurred glass, which makes a lack of contrast much less
likely to occur. I think we’re going to be seeing a lot of screenshots,
videos, and thinkpieces about how this much transparency is going to
hurt readability. I love it when an operating system gets a design
language overhaul, and in this case, Apple is applying it across the
board, to all of its operating systems. This may be the perfect moment
for me to grit my teeth, hold my nose, and get my hands on a Mac just so
I can write about Liquid Glass once it lands.</p>

<h2 id="windows-7-a-2025-perspective-rose-tinted-or-not">Windows 7: a
2025 perspective (rose-tinted or not)</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Quite often, I wonder how much nostalgia plays part in our perception
of past events. Luckily, with software, you can go “back” and retest it,
and so there’s no need for any illusions and misconceptions. To wit, I
decided to reinstall and try Windows 7 again (as a virtual machine, but
still), to see whether my impressions of the dross we call “modern”
software today are justified. ↫ Igor Ljubuncic The conclusion is that,
yes, you can still get quite far today with Windows 7, and I honestly
don’t fault anyone for longing for those days. Windows 7 sits dead smack
in the middle between the dreadfulness of Windows XP and pre-patches
Vista on one extreme, and the ad-infested, “AI”-slop that are Windows 10
and 11. Its Aero look also happens to be experiencing somewhat of a
revival, with both Apple and Google borrowing heavily from it for their
latest software releases. Transparent blurred glass is making a
comeback, but I doubt the current crop of designers at Apple and Google
will be able to top just how nice Aero Glass looked in Windows 7. Still,
I don’t think you should be using an out-of-support version of Windows
for anything more than retrocomputing and as a curiosity, for obvious
reasons we’re all aware of. With the end of support for Windows 10 –
still used by two-thirds of Window users – approaching quickly, a lot of
people are going to have to make the same choice that fans of Windows 7
made years ago: keep using what I like, risks and all, or move on to
what I don’t like, but is at least maintained and supported? That is,
assuming you can even make that choice in the first place, since in the
current economic uncertainty, most definitely cannot. Maybe the Windows
world will dodge a bullet, and the circumstances force Microsoft to
extend support for Windows 10, like they did with Office applications.
Let’s see if they blink, again.</p>
