id="rumour-google-intends-to-discontinue-the-android-open-source-project">Rumour:
Google intends to discontinue the Android Open Source Project</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>With the release of Android 16, Google changed how it developed
Android. Development is now taking place behind closed doors, with the
code dropped after the corresponding version has been released to Pixel
devices. Well, it turns out this wasn’t the only thing Google has
changed about Android development. As the developers of CalyxOS, a
popular de-Googled Android ROM, dove into the Android 16 AOSP source
code, they realised something very important was missing: the
device-specific source code for modern Pixel devices. Android 16 was
released to AOSP yesterday but with a one big difference than typical
releases: Google did not publish any device-specific source code for
supported, modern Pixel devices. In previous years, Google released full
device trees alongside new Android versions. This allowed developers to
build and boot AOSP on Pixel hardware relatively easily. With Android
16, only the platform/framework code has been released. The device trees
are missing, at least for now. This means AOSP 16 cannot currently be
built or run on any recent Pixel device easily just using official
source. It’s unclear whether this is a delay or a policy change. Either
way, it seriously disrupts custom ROM development and our porting
efforts. ↫ CalyxOS on Reddit If this is truly a policy change, it’s a
big one that affects custom ROM developers considerably. Pixel devices
were “special” among custom ROM developers because support for them was
part of AOSP releases, so they were well-supported by projects like
CalyxOS, GrapheneOS, and LineageOS, including all the hardware
components, and with quick updates. Without access to the Pixel-specific
source code for the Pixel 6 to Pixel 9a, these devices will now have to
be treated like any other Android phone as far as ROM developers go,
meaning it’ll take a lot more work and time to get them to work properly
with new major Android releases. Google did not announce this potential
policy change, and this has some in the custom Android ROM community on
edge. I’ve been talking to people in the custom ROM community, and the
story goes that a few months ago, at least one of these communities was
approached by a journalist who wanted to talk to them. This journalist
claimed that Google intends to discontinue the Android Open Source
Project, with the first step Google would take being no longer releasing
the device-specific Pixel source code (something nobody knew would
happen until yesterday). The fact that this first step has now become a
reality lends some credence to the journalist’s claim that Google is
discontinuing AOSP. However, since such tips are not uncommon, and since
there was no way to verify, the custom ROM developers in question didn’t
really know what to do with it. During the writing of this article over
the past 12 hours, Google itself has also responded to what is
apparently a growing, now public concern in the wider Android community.
Seang Chau, Google VP and GM of Android Platform, published a Tweet,
disclaiming Google has any intentions to close up shop for AOSP. We’re
seeing some speculation that AOSP is being discontinued. To be clear,
AOSP is NOT going away. AOSP was built on the foundation of being an
open platform for device implementations, SoC vendors, and instruction
set architectures. AOSP needs a reference target that is flexible,
configurable, and affordable – independent of any particular hardware,
including those from Google. For years, developers have been building
Cuttlefish (available on GitHub as the reference device for AOSP) and
GSI targets from source. We continue to make those available for testing
and development purposes. ↫ Seang Chau This seems like a solid denial
from Google, but it leaves a lot of room for Google to make a wide
variety of changes to Android’s development and open source status
without actually killing off AOSP entirely. Since Android is licensed
under the Apache 2.0 license, Google is free to make “Pixel Android” –
its own Android variant – closed source, leaving AOSP up until that
point available under the Apache 2.0 license. This is reminiscent of
what Oracle did with Solaris. Of course, any modifications to the Linux
kernel upon which Android is built will remain open source, since the
Linux kernel is licensed under the GPLv2. If Google were indeed
intending to do this, what could happen is that Google takes Android
closed source from here on out, spinning off whatever remains of AOSP up
until that point into a separate company or project, as potentially
ordered during the antitrust case against Google in the United States.
This would leave Google free to continue developing its own “Pixel
Android” entirely as proprietary software – save for the Linux kernel –
while leaving AOSP in the state it’s in right now outside of Google.
This technically means “AOSP is not going away”, as Chau claims. Of
course, other parties would then be free to continue working on and
contributing to AOSP, but AOSP itself would no longer benefit from the
work done by Google. Again, this feels very similar to how illumos and
OpenIndiana are built atop the last open source release of Solaris from
2010, without any of the additional work Oracle has done on Solaris
since then. As you can tell, there’s a lot of speculation here, because
even if all of this is true, it seems the ongoing court case and any
rulings that come of it will play a major role in Google’s
decision-making process. The Android Open Source Project has been gutted
over the years, with Google leaving more and more parts of it to
languish, while moving a lot of code and functionality into proprietary
components like Google Mobile Services and Google Play Services. Taking
“Pixel Android” closed source almost feels like the natural next step in
the process of gutting AOSP that’s been ongoing for well over a decade.
As it stands today, a default AOSP installation requires a lot of
additional components and applications before it can be considered a
complete mobile</p>

<h2
id="gnome-adds-dependencies-on-systemd-lots-of-work-to-do-for-systemd-less-environments">GNOME
adds dependencies on systemd, lots of work to do for systemd-less
environments</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>GNOME has announced it’ll be increasing its dependency on systemd,
the popular init system used by most (popular) Linux distributions.
While GNOME already had a few relatively inconsequential dependencies on
systemd, it was effectively not a huge problem to run GNOME on operating
systems that don’t have systemd, which most notably includes the various
flavours of BSD. That’s going to change. There’s going to be two
changes, one of which is relatively minor, and one of which will pose
much bigger problems. The minor change involves GDM becoming dependent
on systemd’s userdb infrastructure in order to clean up a lot of GDM’s
code involved in multi-seat setups and remote login. Currently, this
works through a series of hacks that the GDM developers are going to
clean up, switching to using systemd-userdb to “dynamically allocate
user accounts, and then runs each login screen as a unique user”. To aid
non-systemd environments during this transition, GDM will get a
temporary alternate code path that enables you to run GDM without
systemd-userdb. So if you compile GDM against elogind, GDM will use an
alternative trick to enable multiple graphical sessions under the same
user. This trick will remain in place at least until GNOME 50, but its
future after that is uncertain. The second change is much more involved.
Next, the bigger change. Since GNOME 3.34, gnome-session uses the
systemd user instance to start and manage the various GNOME session
services. When systemd is unavailable, gnome-session falls back to a
builtin service manager. This builtin service manager uses .desktop
files to start up the various GNOME session services, and then monitors
them for failure. This code was initially implemented for GNOME 2.24,
and is starting to show its age. It has received very minimal attention
in the 17 years since it was first written. Really, there’s no reason to
keep maintaining a bespoke and somewhat primitive service manager when
we have systemd at our disposal. The only reason this code hasn’t
completely bit rotted is the fact that GDM’s aforementioned hacks break
systemd and so we rely on the builtin service manager to launch the
login screen. Well, that has now changed. The hacks in GDM are gone, and
the login screen’s session is managed by systemd. This means that the
builtin service manager will now be completely unused and untested.
Moreover: we’d like to implement a session save/restore feature, but the
builtin service manager interferes with that. For this reason, the code
is being removed. ↫ Adrian Vovk Mitigating this change will be a lot
more involved for operating systems that don’t use systemd, and the blog
post goes into detail into what, exactly, needs to be done in
systemd-less environments. There’s quite a few systemd components and
other little tidbits that you will need to find or create alternatives
for, and considering you’ll need to have all of it in place roughly by
GNOME 50, roughly a year from now, I can imagine this causing quite a
few headaches for platforms like the BSDs and Linux distributions using
init systems other than systemd. With these changes, GNOME further
solidifies itself as a Linux desktop only – and lest anyone forget,
that’s entirely within their right to do. Systemd haters can jump up and
down all they want, but in the end, they have no right to demand that
GNOME developers spend precious time and resources testing GNOME on and
developing it for platforms that they themselves do not use. They’re
clearly targeting the trifecta of Linux, system, and Wayland, and that’s
their choice to make, not anyone else’s. Still, if operating systems
like OpenBSD and FreeBSD, or Linux distributions without systemd intend
to continue offering a fully functional GNOME desktop, they’re going to
have some work to do.</p>

<h2 id="android-16-released">Android 16 released</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today, we’re bringing you Android 16, rolling out first to supported
Pixel devices with more phone brands to come later this year. This is
the earliest Android has launched a major release in the last few years,
which ensures you get the latest updates as soon as possible on your
devices. Android 16 lays the foundation for our new Material 3
Expressive design, with features that make Android more accessible and
easy to use. ↫ Seang Chau at the Google blog Android 16 doesn’t seem
like a very big release, and that’s because for most users, it really
isn’t. There’s some neat features in here, like improved notification
grouping, live notifications, a slew of protection features for people
who run increased risk (think journalists or victims of abuse), and
proper desktop-style windowing on tablets, which seems like the tentpole
feature for now. The Material 3 Expressive design is not really here
yet, though as that will come in subsequent Android 16 updates. The
release for devices coincides with the release of the source code, which
is no longer released as part of the development process, but dumped
across the fence at release time. This means that those of us using a
de-Googled Android ROM – I use GrapheneOS – will have to wait a bit
longer than we’re used to before getting the new version.</p>

id="apple-releases-containerization-a-swift-package-for-running-linux-containers-on-macos">Apple
releases Containerization, a Swift package for running Linux containers
on macOS</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>As part of its WWDC announcements, Apple has unveiled
Containerization, which uses macOS’ virtualisation framework to run
Linux containers on Apple Silicon Macs. Containerization executes each
Linux container inside of its own lightweight virtual machine. Clients
can create dedicated IP addresses for every container to remove the need
for individual port forwarding. Containers achieve sub-second start
times using an optimized Linux kernel configuration and a minimal root
filesystem with a lightweight init system. vminitd is a small init
system, which is a subproject within Containerization. vminitd is
spawned as the initial process inside of the virtual machine and
provides a GRPC API over vsock. The API allows the runtime environment
to be configured and containerized processes to be launched. vminitd
provides I/O, signals, and events to the calling process when a process
is ran. ↫ Containerization GitHub page Alongside this new tool, Apple
also released container, which creates and runs OCI-compliant container
images. Yes, both of these names are horribly generic and are definitely
going to lead to confusion in online discussions and writing, but the
tools themselves seem quite nice. People stuck on macOS who need to do
Linux work can now easily get their work done on macOS – if you’re okay
with using Electron for developers, of course, which is what containers
really are. Clearly, nobody can ignore Linux, not even Apple or
Microsoft.</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>macOS Tahoe is the final software update that Intel-based Macs will
get, as Apple works to phase them out following its transition to Apple
silicon. During its Platforms State of the Union event, Apple said that
Intel Macs won’t get macOS 27, coming next year, though there could
still be updates that add security fixes. ↫ Juli Clover at MacRumors Not
particularly surprising, but definitely not great for someone who bought
one of those ungodly expensive Intel Mac Pro only a few years ago – it
wasn’t taken off the shelves until 2023. That’s a hard pill to swallow,
and definitely something I do not think should be legal.</p>

menu bar, and background processes come to iPadOS</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>For years now – it feels more like decades, honestly – Apple has been
trying a variety of approaches to make the iPad more friendly to power
users, most notably by introducing, and subsequently abandoning, various
multitasking models. After its most recent attempts – Stage Manager –
fell on deaf ears, the company has thrown its hands up in the air and
just implemented what we all wanted on the iPad anyway: a normal
windowing environment. Apple today revealed an overhaul of iPad
multitasking, introducing a completely new windowing system, a
macOS-style Menu Bar, a pointer, and more. The centerpiece of the
multitasking improvements is a new macOS-style windowing system. Apps
still launch in full-screen by default, preserving the familiar ‌iPad‌
experience, but users can now resize apps into windows using a new grab
handle. If an app was previously used in a windowed state, it will
remember that layout and reopen the same way next time. ↫ Hartley
Charlton at MacRumors The new window manager includes tiling features,
Exposé, support for multiple displays, and swiping twice on the home
button will minimise all open windows. It’s literally the macOS way of
managing windows transplanted onto the iPad, with some small affordances
for touch input. This is excellent news, and should make the
multitasking features of the iPad, which, at this point, is as powerful
as a MacBook, much more accessible and effortless than all those hidden
gesture-based features from before. The amount of RAM in your iPad seems
to determine how many active windows you can have open before the older
ones get put to sleep, from four on the oldest iPad Pro models, to many
more on the most recent models. Any windows above that limit will still
be visible, but will just be a screenshot of their most recent state
until you interact with them again. Any windows above a limit of twelve
will be pushed to the recents screen instead. In addition, and almost
just as important, iPadOS 26 also introduces proper background
processes, allowing applications to actually keep running in the
background instead of being put to sleep. Anyone who has ever done any
serious work on an iPad that involves long processes like exporting a
video will consider this a godsend. Now all we need is a proper terminal
and Xcode and the iPad can be a real computer.</p>

tales of that time when I sold out to Google’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>If you ever wanted to know what it was like to be an engineer at
Google during the early to late 2000s, here you go. Now even though
Google is fundamentally a spyware advertising company (some 80% of its
revenue is advertising; the proportion was even higher back then), we
Engineers were kept carefully away from that reality, as much as meat
eaters are kept away from videos of the meat industry: don’t think about
it, just enjoy your steak. If you think about it it will stop being
enjoyable, so we just churned along, pretending to work for an
engineering company rather than for a giant machine with the sole goal
of manipulating people into buying cruft. The ads and business teams
were on different floors, and we never talked to them. ↫ Elilla Even
back then, Google knew full well that what they were doing and working
towards was deeply problematic and ethically dubious, at best, and
reading about how young, impressionable Google engineers at the time
figured that out by themselves is kind of heartbreaking. In those days,
Google tried really hard to cultivate an image of being different than
Apple or Microsoft, a place where employees were treated better and had
more freedom, working for a company trying to make the web a better
place. Of course, none of that was actually true, but for a short while
back then, a lot of people fell for it – yes, including you, even if you
now say you didn’t – and reading about the experiences from people on
the inside at the time, it was never actually true.</p>

<h2 id="apple-introduces-new-liquid-glass-design-language">Apple
introduces new Liquid Glass design language</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Apple at WWDC announced iOS 26, introducing a comprehensive visual
redesign built around its new “Liquid Glass” concept, alongside expanded
Apple Intelligence capabilities, updates to core communication apps, and
more. Liquid Glass is a translucent material that reflects and refracts
surroundings to create dynamic, responsive interface elements, according
to Apple. The new design language transforms the Lock Screen, where the
time fluidly adapts to available space in wallpapers, and spatial scenes
add 3D effects when users move their iPhone. Meanwhile, app icons and
widgets gain new customization options, including a striking clear
appearance. ↫ Tim Hardwick at MacRumors Apple also posted a video on
YouTube where you can see the new design language in motion, which gives
a bit of a better idea of what it’s actually like. Of course, before you
believe anyone who’s writing about this new Liquid Glass design
language, the only true way to form a coherent opinion of a user
interface is through usage, so keep that in mind. Looking at the video,
the good part that immediately jumps out at me about this Liquid Glass
stuff is the animations informing you where stuff is coming from and
where it’s going. These are the sort of affordances I was writing about
almost 20 years ago, when Compiz’ animations and effects made windows
and virtual desktops feel like “real” objects that had a physical
presence in a space. Apple’s Liquid Glass seems to have the same effect,
and I’m here for it. The transparency, though, I’m not a huge fan of.
Depending on the content shown beneath the glass user interface
elements, contrast can suffer, making things incredibly hard to read.
While the glassy refraction effects looks neat, I would’ve much rather
seen a focus on blurred glass, which makes a lack of contrast much less
likely to occur. I think we’re going to be seeing a lot of screenshots,
videos, and thinkpieces about how this much transparency is going to
hurt readability. I love it when an operating system gets a design
language overhaul, and in this case, Apple is applying it across the
board, to all of its operating systems. This may be the perfect moment
for me to grit my teeth, hold my nose, and get my hands on a Mac just so
I can write about Liquid Glass once it lands.</p>

<h2 id="windows-7-a-2025-perspective-rose-tinted-or-not">Windows 7: a
2025 perspective (rose-tinted or not)</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Quite often, I wonder how much nostalgia plays part in our perception
of past events. Luckily, with software, you can go “back” and retest it,
and so there’s no need for any illusions and misconceptions. To wit, I
decided to reinstall and try Windows 7 again (as a virtual machine, but
still), to see whether my impressions of the dross we call “modern”
software today are justified. ↫ Igor Ljubuncic The conclusion is that,
yes, you can still get quite far today with Windows 7, and I honestly
don’t fault anyone for longing for those days. Windows 7 sits dead smack
in the middle between the dreadfulness of Windows XP and pre-patches
Vista on one extreme, and the ad-infested, “AI”-slop that are Windows 10
and 11. Its Aero look also happens to be experiencing somewhat of a
revival, with both Apple and Google borrowing heavily from it for their
latest software releases. Transparent blurred glass is making a
comeback, but I doubt the current crop of designers at Apple and Google
will be able to top just how nice Aero Glass looked in Windows 7. Still,
I don’t think you should be using an out-of-support version of Windows
for anything more than retrocomputing and as a curiosity, for obvious
reasons we’re all aware of. With the end of support for Windows 10 –
still used by two-thirds of Window users – approaching quickly, a lot of
people are going to have to make the same choice that fans of Windows 7
made years ago: keep using what I like, risks and all, or move on to
what I don’t like, but is at least maintained and supported? That is,
assuming you can even make that choice in the first place, since in the
current economic uncertainty, most definitely cannot. Maybe the Windows
world will dodge a bullet, and the circumstances force Microsoft to
extend support for Windows 10, like they did with Office applications.
