## Trump asks Supreme Court to allow removal of consumer product safety commissioners

date: 2025-07-03, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>WASHINGTON &#8212; President Donald Trump&#8217;s administration asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday to intervene in his bid to fire three Democratic Consumer Product Safety Commission members by putting on hold a judicial order calling for their reinstatement. In the latest fight over presidential powers to reach the top U.S. judicial body since Trump returned to office in January, the three commissioners in a separate filing told the justices they should be allowed to continue serving while the Supreme Court considers the administration&#8217;s request. Maryland-based U.S. District Judge Matthew Maddox ruled last month that the Republican president had overstepped his authority when he dismissed Commissioners Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric and Richard Trumka Jr, all of whom were appointed by Democratic former President Joe Biden. The Justice Department in Wednesday&#8217;s filing told the Supreme Court that Trump had acted within his powers.</p>

## Ukraine voices concern as US halts some missile shipments

				<p>WASHINGTON/KYIV &#8212; A decision by Washington to halt some shipments of critical weapons to Ukraine prompted warnings by Kyiv on Wednesday that the move would weaken its ability to defend against intensifying airstrikes and battlefield advances. Ukraine said it had called in the acting U.S. envoy to Kyiv to underline the importance of military aid from Washington continuing, and cautioned that any cut-off would embolden Russia in its war in Ukraine. The Pentagon&#8217;s decision &#8212; tied to concerns that U.S. military stockpiles are too low &#8212; began in recent days and includes 30 Patriot air defense missiles, which Ukraine relies on to destroy fast-moving ballistic missiles, four people familiar with the decision said on Wednesday. It also includes nearly 8,500 155mm artillery shells, more than 250 precision GMLRS (mobile rocket artillery) missiles and 142 Hellfire air-to-surface missiles, they said.</p>

## DOGE now targeting SEC policy, eyes SPAC rules, sources say

date: 2025-07-02, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>WASHINGTON/NEW YORK &#8212; President Donald Trump&#8217;s Department of Government Efficiency initiative has pushed the U.S. markets watchdog to loosen Wall Street rules around blank-check companies and confidential reporting by private investment funds, according to two people familiar with the matter. DOGE officials at the SEC, who have so far focused on cutting costs, have in recent weeks sought meetings with staff to explore relaxing what some companies have described as burdensome and unnecessary regulations, including reworking Biden-era rules adopted last year on so-called Special Purpose Acquisition Companies, or SPACs, and requirements that private investment advisers confidentially disclose more data so regulators can better spot systemic risk, the sources said. The efforts, which have not been previously reported, are part of a broader deregulatory push by the administration, which has said it wants to spur economic growth by slashing government oversight. In a February executive order, Trump directed DOGE officials at federal agencies to identify regulations the administration may seek to eliminate for any of a range of different reasons, such as imposing &#8220;undue burdens&#8221; or costs on businesses.</p>

## Trump escalates feud with Musk, threatens Tesla, SpaceX support

date: 2025-07-02, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>WASHINGTON &#8212; U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to cut off the billions of dollars in subsidies that Elon Musk&#8217;s companies receive from the federal government, in an escalation of the war of words between the president and the world&#8217;s richest man, one-time allies who have since fallen out. The feud reignited on Monday when Musk, who spent hundreds of millions on Trump&#8217;s re-election, renewed his criticism of Trump&#8217;s tax-cut and spending bill, which would eliminate subsidies for electric vehicle purchases that have benefited Tesla, the leading U.S. EV maker. That bill passed the Senate by a narrow margin midday Tuesday.</p>

The facility sits some 37 miles (60 km) from Miami in a vast subtropical wetland teeming with alligators, crocodiles and pythons, fearsome imagery the White House has leveraged to show its determination to purge migrants it says were wrongly allowed to stay in the country under former President Joe Biden&#8217;s administration.</p>
