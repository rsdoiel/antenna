## DOGE now targeting SEC policy, eyes SPAC rules, sources say

date: 2025-07-02, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>WASHINGTON/NEW YORK &#8212; President Donald Trump&#8217;s Department of Government Efficiency initiative has pushed the U.S. markets watchdog to loosen Wall Street rules around blank-check companies and confidential reporting by private investment funds, according to two people familiar with the matter. DOGE officials at the SEC, who have so far focused on cutting costs, have in recent weeks sought meetings with staff to explore relaxing what some companies have described as burdensome and unnecessary regulations, including reworking Biden-era rules adopted last year on so-called Special Purpose Acquisition Companies, or SPACs, and requirements that private investment advisers confidentially disclose more data so regulators can better spot systemic risk, the sources said. The efforts, which have not been previously reported, are part of a broader deregulatory push by the administration, which has said it wants to spur economic growth by slashing government oversight. In a February executive order, Trump directed DOGE officials at federal agencies to identify regulations the administration may seek to eliminate for any of a range of different reasons, such as imposing &#8220;undue burdens&#8221; or costs on businesses.</p>

## Trump escalates feud with Musk, threatens Tesla, SpaceX support

date: 2025-07-02, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>WASHINGTON &#8212; U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to cut off the billions of dollars in subsidies that Elon Musk&#8217;s companies receive from the federal government, in an escalation of the war of words between the president and the world&#8217;s richest man, one-time allies who have since fallen out. The feud reignited on Monday when Musk, who spent hundreds of millions on Trump&#8217;s re-election, renewed his criticism of Trump&#8217;s tax-cut and spending bill, which would eliminate subsidies for electric vehicle purchases that have benefited Tesla, the leading U.S. EV maker. That bill passed the Senate by a narrow margin midday Tuesday.</p>

## Trump tours ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ as he pushes for more deportations

				<p>OCHOPEE, Florida &#8212; U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday toured a remote migrant detention center in the Florida Everglades dubbed &#8220;Alligator Alcatraz&#8221; as his Republican allies advanced a sweeping spending bill that could ramp up deportations. The facility sits some 37 miles (60 km) from Miami in a vast subtropical wetland teeming with alligators, crocodiles and pythons, fearsome imagery the White House has leveraged to show its determination to purge migrants it says were wrongly allowed to stay in the country under former President Joe Biden&#8217;s administration.</p>
