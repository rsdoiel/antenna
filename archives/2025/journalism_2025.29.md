Bernardo took the stand Thursday. He said he found Klein&#8217;s email to be &#8220;callous,&#8221; and not reflective of the UCLA Anderson School of Management&#8217;s values. He also listed the “tumult” caused by Klein’s original email, a desire to support students&#8217; interests and damage to the university&#8217;s reputation as motivations for placing Klein on academic leave.

## I teach college and report on Colorado media. More professors should do the same in other states

date: 2025-07-24, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

Over the years, the crisis facing local news has meant the disappearance of reporting on the arts, politics, sports, and local government. Newspapers have disappeared from many local communities, and the ranks of individual local journalists have plummeted over the past two decades. The retrenchment has also led to a loss of something else: reporters and columnists at local news...

## How did newspapers in places like Harrisburg, Birmingham, and Syracuse become some of America’s most-read online?

date: 2025-07-23, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

The size of a news site&#8217;s audience isn&#8217;t everything. For an important story, reaching just one person can make a huge impact — if it&#8217;s the right person, someone who can take action based on what the journalist has learned and shared. Some of the best reporting in the world is aimed at narrow niche...

Madsen also said that he estimated total damages to be $13.3 million, a reduced amount from his initial valuation. He added that the estimate was “conservative” as it only accounted for inflation and not forecasted income growth.

Eric Madsen, a managing director at the Berkeley Research Group and a specialist in economic damages, testified as an expert witness Tuesday. Madsen said that Klein’s administrative leave and Bernardo&#8217;s email calling Klein&#8217;s behavior &#8220;outrageous and simply inexcusable&#8221; was attributable to Klein’s substantial drop in consulting income, which amounted to $1.366 million in 2019.

## Public media is very different from state-run news. Here’s why.

date: 2025-07-22, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

Champions of the almost entirely party-line vote in the U.S. Senate to erase $1.1 billion in already approved funds for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting called their action a refusal to subsidize liberal media. “Public broadcasting has long been overtaken by partisan activists,” said U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, insisting there is no need for government to...
