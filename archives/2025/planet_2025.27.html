' width='620' height='349' title='Colonel &quot;Smak&quot;, the commander of a Ukrainian volunteer unit, plays the strategy game &quot;Blood Bowl&quot; online against his 13-year-old son, temporarily living in the Netherlands, as volunteers remain on alert for air-raid sirens at their base in the suburb of Kyiv on February 27, 2023. Colonel &quot;Smak&quot; and his Ukrainian volunteer unit of 80 civilian volunteers take turns day and night keeping watch for incoming threats: Iranian-made &quot;Shahed&quot; explosive drones launched by the Russians. Since October, the unit - whose machine gun dates back to the 1920s - has shot down three such drones. A dozen of these units, attached to the territorial defence, cover the sky of the Capital city of Ukraine.

Tim Clare says board games like Monopoly and Wingspan are more than just
a fun thing to do. He says games give people a chance to take control of
their circumstances, especially during chaotic times, and make choices
in a situation that likely won’t actually affect their life one way or
the other.
