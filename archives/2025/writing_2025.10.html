Henry Herz, we learn from the ancillary matter in the new original
anthology <b>Combat Monsters</b>, has assembled six other anthologies,

lamentable ignorance is that his prior books are intended for the Young

Adriana remembering her mother’s stories about being a bailadora in

<p>
In the first few scenes of <em>Mickey 17</em>, Mickey Barnes (Robert
Pattinson) through voice over explains the wild and strange reality of
the world the audience is about to experience for the next 2+ hours. He
shares how he became an “Expendable,” someone who signed up for a ride
on a starship voyaging to a new planet, and who is used in any number of
experiments on board that can lead to death. The kicker: once you’re
dead, they can reprint you and implant your memories back into your
brain.

One of the most stressful parts of being a creative is dealing with
failure. What if the transition between act two and act three doesn’t
work? What if your secondary character’s story arc doesn’t make sense?
Even worse – what if your protagonist’s story arc doesn’t make
sense? <br><br>The endless possibility of “what-ifs” that highlight the
shortcomings of your screenplay can stop you midsentence and make you
never return to your draft. <br><br>But what if failure was a part of
the process? Instead of looking at it like a bad word with baggage,
failure can help screenwriters – at least that’s the philosophy that

The ingredients of Erika Swyler’s <strong>We Lived On the Horizon
</strong>are familiar enough: embodied AI, a highly stratified society,
a postapocalyptic city os­sifying from techno-utopia to classist
nightmare. But Swyler’s combination feels fresh; the main characters
here move almost, though not entirely, outside the “real” plot, the

<p>
An antagonist is a character whose story arc and character arc run in
direct opposition to that of the protagonist — the central character
driving the plot forward and facing the central conflict of the story
head-on. <br><br>The antagonist is usually the driving force behind the
conflict the protagonist is facing. They are not always villains, mind
you. Antagonists don’t always have to be evil and terrorizing forces.
They can also have the best of intentions and oppose the protagonist in
more ethical, honorable, and well-meaning ways. <br><br>Here we’ll
discuss everything you need to know about antagonists and villains,
including what purposes they serve in a story, what types of
antagonists/villains you can use, and how you can create the best
antagonists for your stories.
