review: The Lumineers’ timely lyrics shine on ‘Automatic’ despite
mediocre instrumentation</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-14, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>The Lumineers’ newest album is automatically divergent from their
previous works. Known for their stomp-and-holler sound and singalong
melodies, The Lumineers are introducing a fresh note with their fifth
studio album, “Automatic.” While the project consists of a laconic 11
songs spanning less than 33 minutes, its extraordinary lyrics provide a
lasting impression, even when the instrumentation noticeably fizzles
out.</p>
