## CGPU Misleads in Compensation Gains of Proposed Tentative Agreement

date: 2025-01-28, from: California Tech (Caltech Student Newspaper)

I have gathered union petition signatures, organized vote parties for union authorization, sent mass emails in support of the union, and spoken in person to most grad students and postdocs in Schlinger, Church, and Crellin for Caltech Grad Researchers and Postdocs United (CGPU). I’m about as pro-union as they come. But right now,  CGPU is at best misleading and at worst outright lying about compensation gains in the recent tentative agreement (TA).

## The Bubble

## The Case for More Card Readers: How Bechtel’s Single Entrance Costs Students 1,454 Hours Yearly

## What Games Will Be on the Switch 2?

In the midst of procrastinating yet another set, I am seized by my obsession with the godforsaken company Nintendo. Ever since the official announcement of the Nintendo Switch 2 (yes that is actually its name), I have not known a day of peace. I seem to be physically incapable of lasting 24 hours without thinking about this new console. With a supposed price of around $400-449, it is important to see if it will match up to the high price point.
