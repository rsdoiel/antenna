<p>date: 2025-03-24, from: Icon Bar, RISC OS News</p>
<p>The week before a RISC OS Show usually sees lots of news, releases
and updates. And the new RISC OS North Show looks like it will follow
that pattern…</p>

<h2 id="xcopy-version-1.8b">Xcopy version 1.8b</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-23, from: FreeDOS News</p>
<div class="markdown_content">
<p>
Xcopy is a standard DOS command that copies a directory tree. Jeremy has
fixed several bugs in Xcopy and has released version 1.8b. Fixed this
release: rework recursive xcopy to not use as much stack space, increase
stack size when built with Open Watcom, and the <em>listmode</em> ‘/L’
option should not create directory structure (only simulate). Get the
new version from Jeremy’s
<a class="" href="https://github.com/FDOS/xcopy" rel="nofollow">Xcopy at
GitHub</a> or download directly from the

<p>date: 2025-03-23, from: FreeDOS News</p>
<div class="markdown_content">
<p>
Jeremy has released an updated version of the FreeDOS Move command,
which <em>moves</em> a file or directory from one place to another.
Version 3.4 has an update to limit stack usage reducing chance of stack
overflow on recursive moving (using the <code>/S</code> option). You can
find it at Jeremy’s

Pinboard 2.07 and Iris 1.031 from RISC OS Developments</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-23, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>RISC OS Developments are behind the next announcement in my queue, so
over to Richard and Andrew for this joint announcement: RISC OS
Developments is pleased to announce the release of two new software
updates ahead of the RISC OS North show next weekend. Pinboard 2.07
Pinboard 2.07 is the latest version of the enhanced Pinboard/desktop
which we launched last year. It adds the ability to “iconise” sticky
notes so that they don’t take as much desktop space, and improves saving
of stickies for more natural behaviour. Occasional icon drift…</p>

and N.Ex.T</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-23, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>Another announcement from Andrew Rawnsley of R-Comp, this time with
his RCi hat on: We are pleased to announce that Pi 5 technology is now
available in our Hydra computers, and as an optional add-on for N.Ex.T
boxes. The 64-bit only Pi 5 offers a significant performance boost over
the previous generation, with improvements to processing, but also
storage and general server capabilities. As such, it offers a noticeable
upgrade to the Hydra, making additional heads both faster and smoother,
as well as improving file sharing performance. Sadly RISC OS…</p>

<p>date: 2025-03-23, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>It’s now less than a week until the inaugural RISC OS North show, and
that means two things. Firstly, things are hectic here in the bunker as
I prepare for the show myself – and to make matters worse, I will be
temporarily relocating the bunker. And let me tell you, that is not an
easy task. Secondly, it means all the announcements start landing in my
inbox. To save time, I’ll be posting them as received, rather than
writing about them. Here’s the first in my queue, from R-Comp:…</p>

<p>date: 2025-03-23, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>As well as shows like RISC OS North, a good way to support the
operating system is to attend your local user group – and a few will be
represented at this event: The Wakefield RISC OS User Group (WROCC) is a
particularly notable one. It was WROCC that organised the Wakefield Show
and, with it not possible this year for them to run it again, they have
chosen to sponsor this event. They hold regular online meetings (so
being local to them isn’t an issue), with guest speakers, and…</p>
