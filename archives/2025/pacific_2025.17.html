Rise of Higher Education in the Northern Mariana Islands</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-28, updated: 2025-04-28, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>In Saipan, the groundwork for establishing higher education began
with the contributions of dedicated individuals and organizations.
Before the Peace Corps’ involvement, the Micronesian school system was
staffed by a total of 876 teachers, including 172 Americans and 704
Micronesians. Despite these numbers, the system for training Micronesian
teachers produced only a small percentage of fully qualified educators
according to U.S. standards. This inadequacy had a detrimental effect on
the use of English as the language of instruction and the teaching of
English as a second language in schools.</p>

<p>MANGILAO (UOG) — A variety trial conducted over the past year by
University of Guam Cooperative Extension &amp; Outreach tested five
varieties of banana — “Fiji,” “Blue Java,” “Macao,” “Manila,” and “Saba”
— from planting to harvest to see which have ideal characteristics for
being grown commercially in Guam. The study found that “Fiji” and “Saba”
would be ideal for expanded production in Guam due to their highly
marketable qualities, favorable yields, and ability to be sustainably
produced in Guam’s conditions without the use of pesticides.</p>

<p>The Department of Public Works and Northern Marianas College on
Friday, April 25, held a small ribbon-cutting ceremony for the road
project that lines the west side of the NMC campus in Saipan. The
project relocates the thoroughfare that was once located on NMC property
to the designated right of way. For many years, the public road came
through the College, so the new road alleviates traffic cutting through
the college to help ensure student safety on campus. The project
includes CUC’s upgrade of the sewer pipeline in this area. The project
also sets the stage for NMC’s new masterplan which includes multiple new
buildings, a campus quad, and other facilities. Formerly known as
Finasisu Lane, College Lane is a collaboration among Northern Marianas
College, the Saipan and Northern Islands Legislative Delegation,
Commonwealth Economic Development Authority, Department of Public Works,
Commonwealth Utilities Corp. and Yantze Corp. </p>

Barcelona’s creative pulse</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-27, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re in the mood to surrender to a city&amp;#8217;s charms, let it be in Barcelona. Life bubbles in its narrow old town alleys, grand boulevards, and elegant modern district. While Barcelona has an illustrious past &amp;#8212; from Roman colony to 14th-century maritime power &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s enjoyable to throw out the history books and just drift through the city.&lt;/p&gt;
