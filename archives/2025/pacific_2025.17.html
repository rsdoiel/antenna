your home’s electrical system safe? Here’s what you need to know</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-02, updated: 2025-05-02, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>(BPT) - Did you know electrical hazards cause over 50,000 home fires
annually? According to the Electrical Safety Foundation International,
home electrical fires account for around 51,000 U.S. fires each year —
plus nearly 500 deaths, over 1,400 injuries and $1.3 billion in property
damage. Heading into warmer months, electrical systems can be overtaxed
by air conditioning and threatened by stormy weather. Whether you live
in an older home or just want to prevent future problems, now’s the
perfect time to prioritize electrical safety.</p>

<p>(BPT) - La pandemia de COVID-19 provocó un aumento en las
renovaciones de casas a medida que las personas pasaban más tiempo en
sus casas. Muchos realizaron los proyectos ellos mismos, como convertir
garajes o construir casas pequeñas, para satisfacer las nuevas
necesidades y crear espacios habitables ideales. Después de la pandemia,
el enfoque ha cambiado a proyectos más pequeños y asequibles. Sin
embargo, algunos propietarios de viviendas encuentran sus nuevos
espacios incómodos debido a las grandes diferencias de temperatura con
el resto de la casa.</p>

natural light in classrooms is important for student learning,
well-being</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-01, updated: 2025-05-03, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>(BPT) - Imagine spending your entire work day, every day, in a
windowless room, with only artificial light to illuminate your space.
It’s not an inspiring, motivating or pleasant place to spend hundreds of
hours every month, yet for some American children — particularly those
attending schools built in the 1960s and 1970s — this is an unfortunate
reality. Windows were once seen as posing a distraction to children, and
as such, were purposely eliminated from building designs.</p>

<p>(BPT) - Spring has officially sprung, but just as April showers bring
May flowers, these warmer months also herald the start of peak allergy
season. If you are someone who has asthma or suffers from allergies, you
know firsthand how important it is to keep your home dust- and
pollen-free. However, if you aren’t selective enough with your cleaning
products, your good intentions of regular home cleanings may
unintentionally introduce allergens and chemicals back into your space,
potentially making asthma and allergy symptoms worse.</p>

Rise of Higher Education in the Northern Mariana Islands</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-28, updated: 2025-04-28, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>In Saipan, the groundwork for establishing higher education began
with the contributions of dedicated individuals and organizations.
Before the Peace Corps’ involvement, the Micronesian school system was
staffed by a total of 876 teachers, including 172 Americans and 704
Micronesians. Despite these numbers, the system for training Micronesian
teachers produced only a small percentage of fully qualified educators
according to U.S. standards. This inadequacy had a detrimental effect on
the use of English as the language of instruction and the teaching of
English as a second language in schools.</p>

<p>MANGILAO (UOG) — A variety trial conducted over the past year by
University of Guam Cooperative Extension &amp; Outreach tested five
varieties of banana — “Fiji,” “Blue Java,” “Macao,” “Manila,” and “Saba”
— from planting to harvest to see which have ideal characteristics for
being grown commercially in Guam. The study found that “Fiji” and “Saba”
would be ideal for expanded production in Guam due to their highly
marketable qualities, favorable yields, and ability to be sustainably
produced in Guam’s conditions without the use of pesticides.</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-27, updated: 2025-04-27, from: Marianas Variety</p>
<p>The Department of Public Works and Northern Marianas College on
Friday, April 25, held a small ribbon-cutting ceremony for the road
project that lines the west side of the NMC campus in Saipan. The
project relocates the thoroughfare that was once located on NMC property
to the designated right of way. For many years, the public road came
through the College, so the new road alleviates traffic cutting through
the college to help ensure student safety on campus. The project
includes CUC’s upgrade of the sewer pipeline in this area. The project
also sets the stage for NMC’s new masterplan which includes multiple new
buildings, a campus quad, and other facilities. Formerly known as
Finasisu Lane, College Lane is a collaboration among Northern Marianas
College, the Saipan and Northern Islands Legislative Delegation,
Commonwealth Economic Development Authority, Department of Public Works,
Commonwealth Utilities Corp. and Yantze Corp. </p>
