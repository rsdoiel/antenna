## Volcano Watch: What happens beneath the surface doesn’t always stay beneath the surface

date: 2025-02-23, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold

Captivating lava fountains burst from the vent(s) during each eruption episode. Fascinating as those episodes are, scientists at the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory are equally as interested in what&#8217;s happening beneath the surface between episodes.</p>
