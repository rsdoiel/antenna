<h2 id="kde-improves-focus-stealing-prevention-on-wayland">KDE improves
focus stealing prevention on Wayland</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>You click a link in your chat app, your browser with a hundred tabs
comes to the front and opens that page. How hard can it be? Well, you
probably know by now that Wayland, unlike X, doesn’t let one application
force its idiot wishes on everyone else. In order for an application to
bring its window to the front, it needs to make use of the XDG
Activation protocol. In essence, an application cannot take focus, it
can only receive focus. In the example above, your chat app would
request an XDG Activation token from the compositor. It then asks the
system to open the given URL (typically launching the web browser) and
sends along the token. The browser can then use this token to activate
its window. ↫ Kai Uwe After explaining exactly how this mechanism works,
KDE developer Kai Uwe details the issue that not every application yet
properly supports the XDG Activation protocol, and some that do have
bugs that, say, might make an application discard its token too early.
In other words, it’s time to start testing. You’ll need to use the
latest git master brach of KWin, and enable set the “Focus Stealing
Prevention” option in Window Management to “Extreme”. When set to
“Extreme”, KWin will exclusively activate windows that request
activation with a valid token. They’ve already found and fixed a number
of issues in KDE using this method, but more are bound to found,
particularly in third-party applications. They’re planning on turning on
KWin’s focus stealing prevention on Wayland with forgiving settings at
first, but increase the strictness of the feature as time progresses and
issues are fixed.</p>

becomes part of Microsoft’s “AI” organisation</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>It seems Microsoft is absorbing GitHub deeper into Microsoft.
GitHub’s CEO Thomas Dohmke is stepping down, and GitHub will be
integrated into a new department within Microsoft. Which department will
become the new stewards of GitHub, and the massive pile of open source
code it’s hosting? You already know. Still, after all this time, my
startup roots have begun tugging on me and I’ve decided to leave GitHub
to become a founder again. GitHub and its leadership team will continue
its mission as part of Microsoft’s CoreAI organization, with more
details shared soon. I’ll be staying through the end of 2025 to help
guide the transition and am leaving with a deep sense of pride in
everything we’ve built as a remote-first organization spread around the
world. ↫ Thomas Dohmke GitHub will become part of a new “AI” engineering
group inside Microsoft, led by a former Facebook executive, Jay Parikh.
As The Verge notes, this new group includes platform and development
tools and Dev Div teams, “with a focus on building an AI platform and
tools for both Microsoft and its customers”. In other words, Microsoft
is going to streamline taking your code and sucking it up into its “AI”
slop machines. If you’re hosting code on GitHub, the best time to move
it somewhere else was yesterday, but if you haven’t yet, the second best

is better than HDMI, and I will die on this hill</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>Over the years, we’ve seen a good number of interfaces used for
computer monitors, TVs, LCD panels and other all-things-display
purposes. We’ve lived through VGA and the large variety of analog
interfaces that preceded it, then DVI, HDMI, and at some point, we’ve
started getting devices with DisplayPort support. So you might think
it’s more of the same. However, I’d like to tell you that you probably
should pay more attention to DisplayPort – it’s an interface powerful in
a way that we haven’t seen before. ↫ Arya Voronova at HackADay
DisplayPort is a better user experience in every way compared to HDMI. I
am so, so sad that HDMI has won out in the consumer electronics space,
with all of its countless anti-user features as detailed in the linked
article. I refuse to use HDMI when DisplayPort is available, so all of
my computers’ displays are hooked up over DP. Whenever I did try to use
HDMI, I always ran into issues with resolution, refresh rates, improper
monitor detection, and go knows what else. Plug in a DP cable, and
everything always just works. Sadly, in consumer electronics,
DisplayPort isn’t all that common. Game consoles, Hi-Fi audio,
televisions, and so on, all push HDMI hard and often don’t offer a
DisplayPort option at all. It takes me back to the early-to-late 2000s,
when my entire audio setup was hooked up using optical cables, simply
because I was a MiniDisc user and had accepted the gospel of optical
cables. Back then, too, I refused to buy or use anything that used
unwieldy analog cables. Mind you, this had nothing to do with audio
quality – it was a usability thing. If anyone is aware of home audio
devices and televisions that do offer DisplayPort, feel free to jump
into the comments.</p>

<h2 id="zigs-lovely-syntax">Zig’s lovely syntax</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s a bit of a silly post, because syntax is the least interesting d
detail about the language, but, still, I can’t stop thinking how Zig
gets this detail just right for the class of curly-braced languages,
and, well, now you’ll have to think about that too. On the first glance,
Zig looks almost exactly like Rust, because Zig borrows from Rust
liberally. And I think that Rust has great syntax, considering all the
semantics it needs to express (see “Rust’s Ugly Syntax”). But Zig
improves on that, mostly by leveraging simpler language semantics, but
also through some purely syntactical tasteful decisions. ↫ Alex Kladov
Y’all know full well I know very little about programming, so there’s
much interesting stuff I can add here. The only slightly related frame
of reference I have is how some languages – as in, the ones we speak –
have a pleasing grammar or spelling, and how even when you can’t
actually speak a language, some of them intrinsically look attractive
and pleasing when you see them in written form. I mean, you can’t look
at Scottisch Gaelic and not notice it just looks pleasing: Dh’ éirich mi
moch air mhaduinn an-dé‘S gun ghearr mi’n ear-thalmhainn do bhrìgh mo
sgéilAn dùil gu ’m faicinn fhéin rùn mo chléibhOch òin gu ’m faca ’s a
cùl rium féin. ↫ Mo Shùil Ad Dhèidh by Donald MacNicol I have no idea if
programmers can look at programming languages the same way, but I’ve
often been told there’s more overlap between programming languages and
regular language than many people think. As such, it wouldn’t surprise
me if some programming languages look really pleasing to programmers,
even if they can’t use them because they haven’t really learned them
yet.</p>
