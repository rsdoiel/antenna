<h2 id="layout-computer-now-with-casework">‘Layout Computer’ – Now with
Casework</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-21, from: Lost Arg Press blog</p>
<p>When Nick, a woodworker and LAP reader, first let us know about

now I think it’s unbearably cool and altogether useful, because Nick has
added casework (as well as a dovetail…</p>

<h2 id="just-what-is-artisan-geometry">Just What is ‘Artisan
Geometry?’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-19, from: Lost Arg Press blog</p>
<p>“Artisan Geometry” is the overarching term used to describe the
design approach in the five Lost Art Press books by Jim Tolpin and
George Walker. We often get asked to explain it, and to recommend one or
more of their books with which to get started. We decided those
questions would be better answered by…</p>

<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Lost Arg Press blog</p>

quilted cover like a sleeping racehorse. Calvin leaned forward in his
chair staring at it, trying to strike an intense, artistic…</p>

and friend Bob Flexner died at home on December 29, 2024 (read his
