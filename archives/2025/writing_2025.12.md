<p>Dan Erickson is currently one of the hottest TV writers in the business. He created, co-writes, co-produces and serves as showrunner for the popular and acclaimed Apple TV+ series Severance (starring Adam Scott and executive produced and primarily directed by Ben Stiller).<br><br>The second season of the sci-fi psychological thriller met with widespread praise and after its cliffhanger season finale, a third season has been announced. The series’ main plot follows Mark Scout (Adam Scott), who is part of a “severance” program in which his workplace memories are separated from his out-of-work memories, essentially creating two distinct identities: an “innie” whose existence revolves around his life at his corporate workplace, and an “outie” whose personal life is untouched — at least initially — by the drama and intrigue that’s occurring at the nebulous Lumon Industries. As the series progresses, Mark’s two worlds begin to collide, throwing him into an existential crisis as he attempts to find out more about the company he works for, and discover which version of him is his truer self.<br><br>This <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/your-elevator-pitch-just-got-shorter">high concept</a> came solely from Dan Erickson and <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/tv-pilot-writing-building-skeleton-show">a pilot</a> he wrote a decade ago.</p>

## Playwriting vs. Screenwriting: What’s the Difference?

date: 2025-03-25, from: Final Draft blog

</div> 
<p>To the average person, screenwriting and playwriting may seem like interchangeable terms, with the only difference in their eyes being that a screenwriter is writing for the movies while a playwright is writing for the stage. The truth is that the two mediums are vastly different in so many ways, despite sharing the core purpose of telling compelling stories with a cast of characters.<br><br>While each shares that same goal, the method, techniques, and format used to do so is very different.<br><br>Here we’ll delve into those differences — while also shedding some light on their similarities as well — all with the hope of giving you an easy-to-decipher set of guidelines to follow as you explore whether you want to write a screenplay, stage play, or both.&nbsp;</p>
