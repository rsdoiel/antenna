Misleads in Compensation Gains of Proposed Tentative Agreement</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: California Tech (Caltech Student
Newspaper)</p>
<p>I have gathered union petition signatures, organized vote parties for
union authorization, sent mass emails in support of the union, and
spoken in person to most grad students and postdocs in Schlinger,
Church, and Crellin for Caltech Grad Researchers and Postdocs United
(CGPU). I’m about as pro-union as they come. But right now, CGPU is at
best misleading and at worst outright lying about compensation gains in
the recent tentative agreement (TA).</p>

<p>If Plato was the dreamer with his head above the clouds, Aristotle is
the realist with his hands in the soil. He’s the philosopher of
practicality; the one who took the abstract musings of his teacher,
Plato, and said, “Alright, but how does it really work?”</p>

<p>If you’ve recently heard students humming show tunes, hyping up
hockey games, or debating the best rides at Knott’s Berry Farm, you’ve
probably stumbled upon the buzz surrounding Caltech’s Off-Campus
Programming Series… I recently had the chance to chat with Steven
Metzmaker, Assistant Director of Residential &amp; Student Experience,
who has been orchestrating these off-campus escapades.</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: California Tech (Caltech Student
Newspaper)</p>
<p>During my time at Caltech, I’ve noticed that I often use the term
“BUBBLE,” as in phrases like “I’m in my bubble of things to do,”
“Caltech Bubble,” or “problem sets bubble.” Essentially, it’s a closed,
limiting space, even though deep down, I know it’s not.</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: California Tech (Caltech Student
Newspaper)</p>
<p>Most visitors to Caltech’s newest residence were probably surprised
when they first found out that the 212-room building has just one
entrance, an issue which, as a resident of Bechtel myself, has been more
inconvenient than I originally anticipated…<br/><br/>$130,000. That is
my estimate of waste at Bechtel.</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: California Tech (Caltech Student

<p>In the midst of procrastinating yet another set, I am seized by my
obsession with the godforsaken company Nintendo. Ever since the official
announcement of the Nintendo Switch 2 (yes that is actually its name), I
have not known a day of peace. I seem to be physically incapable of
lasting 24 hours without thinking about this new console. With a
supposed price of around $400-449, it is important to see if it will
match up to the high price point.</p>

<p>For UCLA’s fourth-year students, transitions to Zoom classes are
nothing new. The university switched to remote instruction less than a

Take: Going solo allows K-pop artists to achieve full potential outside
of groups</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>For many K-pop artists, it is time to break free of the confinement
of a group and expand their talents by going solo. It has become
increasingly evident over the last few years that the stars of some of
the world’s most successful K-pop groups – especially BLACKPINK and BTS
– would be better off as soloists.</p>
