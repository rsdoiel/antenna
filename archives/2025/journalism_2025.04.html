<p>For UCLA’s fourth-year students, transitions to Zoom classes are
nothing new. The university switched to remote instruction less than a

Take: Going solo allows K-pop artists to achieve full potential outside
of groups</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>For many K-pop artists, it is time to break free of the confinement
of a group and expand their talents by going solo. It has become
increasingly evident over the last few years that the stars of some of
the world’s most successful K-pop groups – especially BLACKPINK and BTS
– would be better off as soloists.</p>
