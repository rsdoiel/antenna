## IFSC Competition Regulations Para Climbing Events

The international federation of sport climbing released its 2025 paraclimbing regulations. The document was a PDF that was in accessible to screen readers so I converted it to HTML. It is far from perfect, but should be a lot better than the PDF. For some odd reason every bit of text on the PDF was [&#8230;]

## Minimal CSS-only blurry image placeholders

date: 2025-03-30, from: Lean Rada's blog


<p>Here‚Äôs a CSS technique that produces blurry image placeholders (LQIPs) without cluttering up your markup ‚Äî <em>Only a single custom property needed!</em></p>
<card-box>
  <code-block language="html">
    <pre><code>&lt;img src="‚Ä¶" style="--lqip:192900"&gt;</code></pre>
  </code-block>

  <p>The custom property above gives you this image:</p>

  <p>
  </p><div></div>
  <p></p>

  <label>
    Try changing the property‚Äôs value <strong>(WARNING: FLASHING)</strong>
    <input type="range" min="-999999" max="999999">
  </label>
  <script>
    {
      const card = document.currentScript.parentElement;
      const input = card.querySelector("input");
      const code = card.querySelector("code");
      const preview = card.querySelector("div");

      let currentValueStr = "192900";
      let targetCode = null

      input.addEventListener("input", event => {
        if (!targetCode) {
          targetCode = Array.from(code.querySelectorAll("span")).filter(el => el.textContent.includes(currentValueStr)).slice(-1)[0] ?? code;
        }

        const lqip = Number(event.currentTarget.value);
        // use this page's lqip to avoid breakage if I ever update the scheme
        preview.style.setProperty("--my-lqip", lqip);
        targetCode.innerHTML = targetCode.innerHTML.replace(currentValueStr, lqip);
        currentValueStr = String(lqip);
      });
    }
  </script>
</card-box>
<p>Granted, it‚Äôs a <em>very blurry</em> placeholder especially in contrast to other leading solutions. But the point is that it‚Äôs minimal and non-invasive! No need for wrapper elements or attributes with long strings of data, or JavaScript at all.</p>

<h2>Survey of LQIP approaches</h2>

<p>There have been many different techniques to implement LQIPs (low quality image placeholders), such as a very low
  resolution WebP or JPEG (<a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2015/08/06/android/the-technology-behind-preview-photos/" target="_blank">beheaded JPEGs</a> even), optimised SVG shape placements (<a href="https://github.com/axe312ger/sqip" target="_blank">SQIP</a>), and directly applying a discrete cosine
  transform (<a href="https://blurha.sh/" target="_blank">BlurHash</a>). Don‚Äôt forget good old progressive JPEGs and interlaced
  PNGs!</p>

  <figcaption>Canva and Pinterest use solid colour placeholders.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At the other end of the spectrum, we have low tech solutions such as a simple solid fill of the image‚Äôs average colour.</p>

<p>Pure inline CSS solutions have the advantage rendering immediately ‚Äî even a <code>background-image: url(‚Ä¶a data URL)</code> would be fine!</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/css-only-lqip/gradient-css.png?ref=rss" alt="image gallery with gradient placeholders" width="1368" height="832">
  <figcaption><a href="https://github.com/fraser-hemp/gradify" target="_blank">Gradify</a> generates linear-gradients
    that very roughly approximate the full image.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The big disadvantage of pure CSS approaches is that you typically litter your markup with lengthy inline styles or obnoxious data URLs. My handcoded site with no build step would be extra incompatible with this approach!</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- typical gradify css --&gt;
&lt;img width="200" height="150" style="
  background: linear-gradient(45deg, #f4a261, transparent),
    linear-gradient(-45deg, #e76f51, transparent),
    linear-gradient(90deg, #8ab17d, transparent),
    linear-gradient(0deg, #d62828, #023047);
"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong><a href="https://blurha.sh/">BlurHash</a></strong> is a solution that minimises markup by compressing image
  data into a
  <strong>short base-83 string</strong>, but decoding and rendering that data requires additional JS‚Ä¶
</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- a blurhash markup --&gt;
&lt;img width="200" height="150" src="‚Ä¶"
  data-blurhash="LEHV6nWB2yk8pyo0adR*.7kCMdnj"&gt;</code></pre>

  <figcaption>BlurHash example</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Is it possible to decode a blur hash in CSS instead?</p>

<h2>Decoding in pure CSS</h2>

<p>Unlike BlurHash, we can‚Äôt use a string encoding because there are very few if any string manipulation
  functions in CSS (2025), so strings are out.</p>

<p>In the end, I came up with my own hash / encoding, and the <b>integer</b> type was the best vessel for it.</p>

<p>The usual way to encode stuff in a single integer is by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_manipulation" target="_blank"><strong>bit packing</strong></a>, where you pack multiple numbers in an integer as bits. Amazingly, we can unpack them in pure CSS!</p>

<p>To unpack bits, all you need is bit shifting and bit masking. <strong>Bit shifting</strong> can be done by division and floor operations ‚Äî <code>calc(x / y)</code> and <code>round(down,n)</code> ‚Äî and <strong>bit masking</strong> via the modulo function <code>mod(a,b)</code>.</p>

<pre><code>* {
/* Example packed int: */
/* 0b11_00_001_101 */
--packed-int: 781;
--bits-9-10: mod(round(down, calc(var(--packed-int) / 256)), 4); /* 3 */
--bits-7-8: mod(round(down, calc(var(--packed-int) / 64)), 4); /* 0 */
--bits-4-6: mod(round(down, calc(var(--packed-int) / 8)), 8); /* 1 */
--bits-0-3: mod(var(--packed-int), 8); /* 5 */
}</code></pre>

<p>Of course, we could also use <code>pow(2,n)</code> instead of hardcoded powers of two.</p>

<p>So, a <strong>single CSS integer value</strong> was going to be the encoding of the ‚Äúhash‚Äù of my CSS-only blobhash
  (that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm calling it now). But how much information can we pack in a single CSS int?</p>

<h2>Side quest: Limits of CSS values</h2>

<p>The spec doesn‚Äôt say anything about the allowed range for int values, leaving the fate of my shenanigans to browser vendors.</p>

<p>From my experiments, apparently you can only use integers from <strong>-999,999 up to 999,999</strong> in custom
  properties before you lose precision. Just beyond that limit, we start getting values rounded to tens ‚Äî
  1,234,56<del>7</del> becomes 1,234,56<ins>0</ins>. Which is weird (precision is counted in decimal places!?), but I
  bet it‚Äôs due to historical, Internet Explorer-esque reasons.</p>

<p>Anyway, within the range of [-999999, 999999] there are <strong>1,999,999</strong> values. This meant that with a
  single integer hash, almost two million LQIP configurations could be described. To make calculation
  easier, I reduced it to the nearest power of two down which is 2<sup>20</sup>.</p>
<card-box>
  <code>2<sup>20</sup> = 1,048,576 &lt; 1,999,999 &lt; 2,097,152 = 2<sup>21</sup></code>
</card-box>
<p><strong>In short, I had 20 bits of information to encode the CSS-based LQIP hash.</strong></p>
<box-note><strong>Why is it called a ‚Äúhash‚Äù?</strong> Because it‚Äôs a mapping from an any-size data to a fixed-size
  value. In this case, there are an infinite number of images of arbitrary sizes, but only 1,999,999 possible hash
  values.</box-note>
<h2>The Scheme</h2>

<p>With only 20 bits, the LQIP image must be a very simplified version of the full image. I ended up with this scheme:
  a single base colour + 6 brightness components, to be overlaid on top of the base colour in a 3√ó2 grid. A
  rather extreme version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_subsampling" target="_blank">chroma
    subsampling</a>.</p>

<img src="https://leanrada.com/notes/css-only-lqip/scheme.png?ref=rss" alt="illustration of encoded components" width="600" height="500">

<p>This totals <strong>9 numbers</strong> to pack into the 20-bit integer:</p>

<p>The <strong>base colour</strong> is encoded in the <strong>lower 8 bits</strong> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklab_color_space" target="_blank">Oklab colour space</a>. 2 bits for luminance, and 3 bits for each of the a and b coordinates. I‚Äôve found Oklab to give subjectively balanced results, but RGB should work just as well.</p>

<p>The <strong>6 greyscale components</strong> are encoded in the <strong>higher 12 bits</strong> ‚Äî 2 bits each.</p>

<p>An offline script was created to compress any given image into this integer format. The script was quite simple: Get the average
  or dominant colour ‚Äî there are a lot of libraries that can do that ‚Äî then resize the image down to
  3√ó2 pixels and get the greyscale values. <a href="https://github.com/Kalabasa/leanrada.com/blob/7b6739c7c30c66c771fcbc9e1dc8942e628c5024/main/scripts/update/lqip.mjs#L118-L159" target="_blank">Here‚Äôs my script.</a></p>
<box-note>I even tried a <a href="https://blog.4dcu.be/programming/2020/01/12/Genetic-Art-Algorithm.html" target="_blank">genetic algorithm</a> to optimise the LQIP bits, but the fitness function was hard to establish. Ultimately, I would‚Äôve needed an offline CSS renderer for this to work accurately. Maybe a future iteration could use some headless Chrome solution to automatically compare real renderings of the LQIP against the source image.</box-note>
<p>Once encoded, it‚Äôs set as the value of <code>--lqip</code> via the style attribute in the target element. It could then be decoded in CSS. Here‚Äôs the actual code I used for decoding:</p>

<pre><code>[style*="--lqip:"] {
--lqip-ca: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 18))), 4);
--lqip-cb: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 16))), 4);
--lqip-cc: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 14))), 4);
--lqip-cd: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 12))), 4);
--lqip-ce: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 10))), 4);
--lqip-cf: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 8))), 4);
--lqip-ll: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 6))), 4);
--lqip-aaa: mod(round(down, calc((var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)) / pow(2, 3))), 8);
--lqip-bbb: mod(calc(var(--lqip) + pow(2, 19)), 8);</code></pre>

<p>Before rendering the decoded values, the raw number data values need to be converted to CSS colours. It‚Äôs fairly
  straightforward, just a bunch linear interpolations into colour constructor functions.</p>

<pre><code>/* continued */
--lqip-ca-clr: hsl(0 0% calc(var(--lqip-ca) / 3 * 100%));
--lqip-cb-clr: hsl(0 0% calc(var(--lqip-cb) / 3 * 100%));
--lqip-cc-clr: hsl(0 0% calc(var(--lqip-cc) / 3 * 100%));
--lqip-cd-clr: hsl(0 0% calc(var(--lqip-cd) / 3 * 100%));
--lqip-ce-clr: hsl(0 0% calc(var(--lqip-ce) / 3 * 100%));
--lqip-cf-clr: hsl(0 0% calc(var(--lqip-cf) / 3 * 100%));
--lqip-base-clr: oklab(
  calc(var(--lqip-ll) / 3 * 0.6 + 0.2)
  calc(var(--lqip-aaa) / 8 * 0.7 - 0.35)
  calc((var(--lqip-bbb) + 1) / 8 * 0.7 - 0.35)
);
}</code></pre>
<card-box>
  <strong>Time for another demo!</strong>
  <label>
    Try different values of <code>--lqip</code> to decode
    <input type="range" min="-999999" max="999999">
  </label>
  <p>
    <code></code>
  </p>
  <script>
    {
      const card = document.currentScript.parentElement;
      const input = card.querySelector("input");
      const preview = card.querySelector(".lqip-unpack").parentElement;

      let currentValueStr = "-721311";
      render(Number(currentValueStr));

      input.addEventListener("input", event => {
        const lqip = Number(event.currentTarget.value);
        render(lqip);
        currentValueStr = String(lqip);
      });

      function render(lqip) {
        preview.style.setProperty("--my-lqip", lqip);
      };
    }
  </script>
  

  You can see here how each component variable maps to the LQIP image. E.g. the <code>cb</code> value corresponds to
  the relative brightness of the top middle area. <em>Fun fact: The above preview content is implemented in pure
    CSS!</em>
</card-box>
<h2>Rendering it all</h2>

<p>Finally, rendering the LQIP. I used multiple <strong>radial gradients</strong> to render the greyscale components,
  and a flat base colour at the bottom.</p>

<pre><code>[style*="--lqip:"] {
background-image:
  radial-gradient(50% 75% at 16.67% 25%, var(--lqip-ca-clr), transparent),
  radial-gradient(50% 75% at 50% 25%, var(--lqip-cb-clr), transparent),
  radial-gradient(50% 75% at 83.33% 25%, var(--lqip-cc-clr), transparent),
  radial-gradient(50% 75% at 16.67% 75%, var(--lqip-cd-clr), transparent),
  radial-gradient(50% 75% at 50% 75%, var(--lqip-ce-clr), transparent),
  radial-gradient(50% 75% at 83.33% 75%, var(--lqip-cf-clr), transparent),
  linear-gradient(0deg, var(--lqip-base-clr), var(--lqip-base-clr));
}</code></pre>

<p>The above is a simplified version of the full renderer for illustrative purposes. <small>The real one has doubled layers, smooth gradient falloffs, and blend modes.</small></p>

<p>As you might expect, the radial gradients are arranged in a 3√ó2 grid. You can see it in this interactive deconstructor view!</p>
<card-box>
  <strong>LQIP deconstructor!</strong>
  <label>
    Reveal the individual layers using this slider!
    <input type="range" min="0" max="100" value="0">
    Change the <code>--lqip</code> value,
    <input type="range" min="-999999" max="999999">
  </label>
  <div></div>
  <script>
    {
      const card = document.currentScript.parentElement;
      const [revealInput, lqipInput] = card.querySelectorAll("input");
      const preview = card.querySelector(".lqip-reveal");

      let currentValueStr = "-747540";
      render(Number(currentValueStr));

      lqipInput.addEventListener("input", event => {
        const lqip = Number(event.currentTarget.value);
        render(lqip);
        currentValueStr = String(lqip);
      });

      revealInput.addEventListener("input", event => {
        preview.style.setProperty("--reveal", event.currentTarget.value / 100);
      });

      function render(lqip) {
        preview.style.setProperty("--my-lqip", lqip);
      };
    }
  </script>
  
</card-box>
<p>These radial gradients are the core of the CSS-based LQIP. The position and radius of the gradients are an important detail that would determine how well these can approximate real images. Besides that, another requirement is that these individual radial gradients must be seamless when combined together.</p>

<p>I implemented smooth gradient falloffs to make the final result look seamless. It took special care to make the gradients extra smooth, so let‚Äôs dive into it‚Ä¶</p>

<h2>Bilinear interpolation approximation with radial gradients</h2>

<p>Radial gradients use linear interpolation by default. Interpolation refers to how it maps the in-between colours from the start colour to the end colour. And linear interpolation, the most basic interpolation, well‚Ä¶</p>

<figure>
  <interpolation-example></interpolation-example>
  <figcaption>CSS radial-gradients with linear interpolation</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It doesn‚Äôt look good. It gives us these hard edges (highlighted above). You could almost see the elliptical edges of each radial gradient and their centers.</p>

<p>In real raster images, we‚Äôd use <a href="https://harmoniccode.blogspot.com/2011/04/bilinear-color-interpolation.html" target="_blank">bilinear interpolation</a> at the very least when scaling up low resolution images. <a href="https://blog.demofox.org/2015/08/15/resizing-images-with-bicubic-interpolation/" target="_blank">Bicubic interpolation is even better.</a></p>

<p>One way to simulate the smoothness of bilinear interpolation in an array of CSS radial-gradients is to use <strong>‚Äòquadratic easing‚Äô</strong> to control the gradation of opacity.</p>

<p>This means the opacity falloff of the gradient would be smoother around the center and the edges. Each gradient would get feathered edges, smoothening the overall composite image.</p>

<p>However, CSS gradients <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1332" target="_blank">don‚Äôt support nonlinear interpolation of opacity yet as of writing</a> (not to be confused with colour space interpolation, which browsers do support!). The solution for now is to add more points in the gradient to get a smooth opacity curve based on the quadratic formula.</p>

<pre><code>radial-gradient(
  &lt;position&gt;,
  rgb(82 190 240 / 100%) 0%,

<p>The quadratic easing blends adjacent radial gradients together, mimicking the smooth bilinear (or even bicubic) interpolation. It‚Äôs almost like a fake blur filter, thus achieving the ‚Äòblur‚Äô part of this BlurHash alternative.</p>

<h2>Appendix: Alternatives considered</h2>

<h3>Four colours instead of monochromatic preview</h3>

<p>Four 5-bit colours, where each <b>R</b> is 2 bits, <b>G</b> is 2 bits, and <b>B</b> is just a zero or one.</p>

<p>The four colours would map to the four corners of the image box, rendered as radial gradients</p>

<p>This was my first attempt, and I fiddled with this for a while, but mixing four colours properly require proper bilinear interpolation and probably a shader. Just layering gradients resulted in muddiness (just like mixing too many watercolour pigments), and there was no CSS blend mode that could fix it. So I abandoned it, and moved on to a monochromatic approach.</p>

<h3>Single solid colour</h3>

<p>This was what I used on this website before. It‚Äôs simple and effective. A clean-markup approach could still use the custom <code>--lqip</code> variable:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src="‚Ä¶" style="--lqip:#9bc28e"&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
/* we save some bytes by ‚Äòaliasing‚Äô this property */
* { background-color: var(--lqip) }
&lt;/style&gt;</code></pre>

<h3>HTML attribute instead of CSS custom property</h3>

<p>We can use HTML attributes to control CSS soon! Here‚Äôs what the LQIP markup would look like in the future:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src="‚Ä¶" lqip="192900"&gt;</code></pre>

<p>Waiting for <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/advanced-attr" target="_blank"><code>attr()</code> Level 5</a> for this one. It‚Äôs nicer and shorter, fewer weird punctuations in markup <small>(who came up with the double dash for CSS vars anyway?)</small>. The value can then be referenced in CSS with <code>attr(lqip type(&lt;number&gt;))</code> instead of <code>var(--lqip)</code>.</p>

<p>For extra safety, a <code>data-</code> prefix could be added to the attribute name.</p>

<p>Can‚Äôt wait for this to get widespread adoption. I also want it for my <a href="https://jordanbrennan.hashnode.dev/tac-a-new-css-methodology" target="_blank">TAC components</a>.</p>

## Incomplete JSON Pretty Printer

date: 2025-03-28, updated: 2025-03-28, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/incomplete-json-printer">Incomplete JSON Pretty Printer</a></strong></p>
Every now and then a log file or a tool I'm using will spit out a bunch of JSON that terminates unexpectedly, meaning I can't copy it into a text editor and pretty-print it to see what's going on.</p>
<p>The other day I got frustrated with this and had the then-new GPT-4.5 build me a pretty-printer that didn't mind incomplete JSON, using an OpenAI Canvas. Here's <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67dd9d55-7f70-8006-b55d-72730f60ddbe">the chat</a> and here's <a href="https://chatgpt.com/canvas/shared/67e5e9b3f7bc8191b2306a123c9d328f">the resulting interactive</a>.</p>
<p>I spotted a bug with the way it indented code today so I pasted it into Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking mode and had it make a bunch of improvements - <a href="https://claude.ai/share/22dc4b58-e8c4-44a4-9650-a37d21513b8d">full transcript here</a>. Here's the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/incomplete-json-printer.html">finished code</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Animated GIF demo - as I type JSON it is pretty printed below, at the end I click the Load Pelican Example button." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/pretty-print-json.gif" /></p>
<p>In many ways this is a perfect example of <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/">vibe coding </a> in action. At no point did I look at a <em>single line</em> of code that either of the LLMs had written for me. I honestly don't care how this thing works: it could not be lower stakes for me, the worst a bug could do is show me poorly formatted incomplete JSON.</p>
<p>I was vaguely aware that some kind of state machine style parser would be needed, because you can't parse incomplete JSON with a regular JSON parser. Building simple parsers is the kind of thing LLMs are surprisingly good at, and also the kind of thing I don't want to take on for a trivial project.</p>
<p>At one point I told Claude "Try using your code execution tool to check your logic", because I happen to know Claude can write and then execute JavaScript independently of using it for artifacts. That helped it out a bunch.</p>
<p>I later dropped in the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>modify the tool to work better on mobile screens and generally look a bit nicer - and remove the pretty print JSON button, it should update any time the input text is changed. Also add a "copy to clipboard" button next to the results. And add a button that says "example" which adds a longer incomplete example to demonstrate the tool, make that example pelican themed.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's fun being able to say "generally look a bit nicer" and get a perfectly acceptable result!

## Quoting Nelson Minar

<blockquote cite="https://lobste.rs/s/aygeaq/atom_vs_rss_2013#c_mxxurc"><p>I was there at the first Atom meeting at the Google offices. We meant so well! And I think the basic publishing spec is good, certainly better technically than the pastiche of different things called RSS.</p>
<p>Alas, a bunch of things then went wrong. Feeds started losing market share. Facebook started doing something useful and interesting that ultimately replaced blog feeds in open formats. The Atom vs RSS spec was at best irrelevant to most people (even programmers) and at worst a confusing market-damaging thing. The XML namespaces in Atom made everyone annoyed. Also there was some confusing ‚ÄúAtom API‚Äù for publishing that diluted Atom‚Äôs mindshare for feeds.</p></blockquote>

## Tracing the thoughts of a large language model

date: 2025-03-27, updated: 2025-03-27, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/tracing-thoughts-language-model">Tracing the thoughts of a large language model</a></strong></p>
In a follow-up to the research that brought us the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/24/golden-gate-claude/">delightful Golden Gate Claude</a> last year, Anthropic have published two new papers about LLM interpretability:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/methods.html">Circuit Tracing: Revealing Computational Graphs in Language Models </a> extends last year's interpretable features into <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/methods.html#graphs">attribution graphs</a>, which can "trace the chain of intermediate steps that a model uses to transform a specific input prompt into an output response".</li>
<li><a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/biology.html">On the Biology of a Large Language Model</a> uses that methodology to investigate Claude 3.5 Haiku in a bunch of different ways. <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/biology.html#dives-multilingual">Multilingual Circuits</a> for example shows that the same prompt in three different languages uses similar circuits for each one, hinting at an intriguing level of generalization.</li>
</ul>
<p>To my own personal delight, neither of these papers are published as PDFs. They're both presented as glorious mobile friendly HTML pages with linkable sections and even some inline interactive diagrams. More of this please!</p>

## GPT-4o got another update in ChatGPT

date: 2025-03-27, updated: 2025-03-27, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1905331956856050135">GPT-4o got another update in ChatGPT</a></strong></p>
This is a somewhat frustrating way to announce a new model. @OpenAI on Twitter just now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GPT-4o got an another update in ChatGPT!</p>
<p>What's different?</p>
<ul>
<li>Better at following detailed instructions, especially prompts containing multiple requests</li>
<li>Improved capability to tackle complex technical and coding problems</li>
<li>Improved intuition and creativity</li>
<li>Fewer emojis üôÉ</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This sounds like a significant upgrade to GPT-4o, albeit one where the release notes are limited to a single tweet.</p>
<p>ChatGPT-4o-latest (2025-0-26) just hit second place on <a href="https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard">the LM Arena leaderboard</a>, behind only Gemini 2.5, so this really is an update worth knowing about.</p>
<p>The @OpenAIDevelopers account <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1905335104211185999">confirmed</a> that this is also now available in their API:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>chatgpt-4o-latest</code> is now updated in the API, but stay tuned‚Äîwe plan to bring these improvements to a dated model in the API in the coming weeks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/17/llm/#chatgpt-4o-latest">wrote about chatgpt-4o-latest</a> last month - it's a model alias in the OpenAI API which provides access to the model used for ChatGPT, available since August 2024. It's priced at $5/million input and $15/million output - a step up from regular GPT-4o's $2.50/$10.</p>
<p>I'm glad they're going to make these changes available as a dated model release - the <code>chatgpt-4o-latest</code> alias is risky to build software against due to its tendency to change without warning.</p>
<p>A more appropriate place for this announcement would be the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/changelog">OpenAI Platform Changelog</a>, but that's not had an update since the release of their new audio models on March 20th.

## Thoughts on setting policy for new AI capabilities

date: 2025-03-27, updated: 2025-03-27, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://reservoirsamples.substack.com/p/thoughts-on-setting-policy-for-new">Thoughts on setting policy for new AI capabilities</a></strong></p>
Joanne Jang leads model behavior at OpenAI. Their release of GPT-4o image generation included some notable relaxation of OpenAI's policies concerning acceptable usage - I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/25/introducing-4o-image-generation/">noted some of those</a> the other day.</p>
<p>Joanne summarizes these changes like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>tl;dr we‚Äôre shifting from blanket refusals in sensitive areas to a more precise approach focused on preventing real-world harm. The goal is to embrace humility: recognizing how much we don't know, and positioning ourselves to adapt as we learn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This point in particular resonated with me:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trusting user creativity over our own assumptions</strong>. AI lab employees should not be the arbiters of what people should and shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to create.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A couple of years ago when OpenAI were the only AI lab with models that were worth spending time with it really did feel that San Francisco cultural values (which I relate to myself) were being pushed on the entire world. That cultural hegemony has been broken now by the increasing pool of global organizations that can produce models, but it's still reassuring to see the leading AI lab relaxing its approach here.

## Nomic Embed Code: A State-of-the-Art Code Retriever

date: 2025-03-27, updated: 2025-03-27, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://www.nomic.ai/blog/posts/introducing-state-of-the-art-nomic-embed-code">Nomic Embed Code: A State-of-the-Art Code Retriever</a></strong></p>
Nomic have released a new embedding model that specializes in code, based on their CoRNStack "large-scale high-quality training dataset specifically curated for code retrieval".</p>
<p>The <a href="https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-code">nomic-embed-code</a> model is pretty large - 26.35GB - but the announcement also mentioned a much smaller model (released 5 months ago) called <a href="https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/CodeRankEmbed">CodeRankEmbed</a> which is just 521.60MB.</p>
<p>I missed that when it first came out, so I decided to give it a try using my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-sentence-transformers">llm-sentence-transformers</a> plugin for <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a>.</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-sentence-transformers
llm sentence-transformers register nomic-ai/CodeRankEmbed --trust-remote-code
</code></pre>
<p>Now I can run the model like this:</p>
<pre><code>llm embed -m sentence-transformers/nomic-ai/CodeRankEmbed -c 'hello'
</code></pre>
<p>This outputs an array of 768 numbers, starting <code>[1.4794224500656128, -0.474479079246521, ...</code>.</p>
<p>Where this gets fun is combining it with my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jun/18/symbex/">Symbex tool</a> to create and then search embeddings for functions in a codebase.</p>
<p>I created an index for my LLM codebase like this:</p>
<pre><code>cd llm
symbex '*' '*.*' --nl &gt; code.txt
</code></pre>
<p>This creates a newline-separated JSON file of all of the functions (from <code>'*'</code>) and methods (from <code>'*.*'</code>) in the current directory - you can <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/ac45c6638ea87942383e97c5cf69ae09">see that here</a>.</p>
<p>Then I fed that into the <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/embeddings/cli.html#llm-embed-multi">llm embed-multi</a> command like this:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>I found the <code>--batch-size</code> was needed to prevent it from crashing with an error. </p>
<p>The above command creates a collection called <code>code</code> in a SQLite database called <code>code.db</code>.</p>
<p>Having run this command I can search for functions that match a specific search term in that <code>code</code> collection like this:</p>
<pre><code>llm similar code -d code.db \
  -c 'Represent this query for searching relevant code: install a plugin' | jq
</code></pre>
<p>That <code>"Represent this query for searching relevant code: "</code> prefix is required by the model. I pipe it through <code>jq</code> to make it a little more readable, which gives me <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/fdc1b48b20a99714200f5d3970b1dff4">these results</a>.</p>
<p>This <code>jq</code> recipe makes for a better output:</p>
<pre><code>llm similar code -d code.db \
  -c 'Represent this query for searching relevant code: install a plugin' | \
  jq -r '.id + "\n\n" + .content + "\n--------\n"'
</code></pre>
<p>The output from that starts like so:</p>
<pre><code>llm/cli.py:1776

@cli.command(name="plugins")
@click.option("--all", help="Include built-in default plugins", is_flag=True)
def plugins_list(all):

@cli.command()
@click.argument("packages", nargs=-1, required=False)

)
...
def install(packages, upgrade, editable, force_reinstall, no_cache_dir):
    """Install packages from PyPI into the same environment as LLM"""

## Crawl Order and Disorder

A problem the search engine&rsquo;s crawler has struggled with for some time is that it takes a fairly long time to finish up, usually spending several days wrapping up the final few domains.
This has been actualized recently, since the migration to slop crawl data has dropped memory requirements of the crawler by something like 80%, and as such I&rsquo;ve been able to increase the number of crawling tasks, which has led to a bizarre case where 99.

## Function calling with Gemma

date: 2025-03-26, updated: 2025-03-26, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/capabilities/function-calling">Function calling with Gemma</a></strong></p>
Google's Gemma 3 model (the 27B variant is particularly capable, I've been trying it out <a href="https://ollama.com/library/gemma3">via Ollama</a>) supports function calling exclusively through prompt engineering. The official documentation describes two recommended prompts - both of them suggest that the tool definitions are passed in as JSON schema, but the way the model should request tool executions differs.</p>
<p>The first prompt uses Python-style function calling syntax:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>You have access to functions. If you decide to invoke any of the function(s),
 you MUST put it in the format of [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, params_name2=params_value2...), func_name2(params)]</code></p>
<p><code>You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response if you call a function</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Always love seeing CAPITALS for emphasis in prompts, makes me wonder if they proved to themselves that capitalization makes a difference in this case.)</p>
<p>The second variant uses JSON instead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>You have access to functions. If you decide to invoke any of the function(s),
you MUST put it in the format of {"name": function name, "parameters": dictionary of argument name and its value}</code></p>
<p><code>You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response if you call a function</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a neat illustration of the fact that all of these fancy tool using LLMs are still using effectively the same pattern as was described in <a href="https://react-lm.github.io/">the ReAct paper</a> back in November 2022. Here's <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/python-react-pattern">my implementation of that pattern</a> from March 2023.

## Note on 26th March 2025

date: 2025-03-26, updated: 2025-03-26, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p>I've added a new content type to my blog: <strong>notes</strong>. These join my existing types: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/search/?type=entry">entries</a>, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/search/?type=blogmark">bookmarks</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/search/?type=quotation">quotations</a>.</p>
<p>A note is a little bit like a bookmark without a link. They're for short form writing - thoughts or images that don't warrant a full entry with a title. The kind of things I used to post to Twitter, but that don't feel right to cross-post to multiple social networks (Mastodon and Bluesky, for example.)</p>
<p>I was partly inspired by Molly White's <a href="https://www.mollywhite.net/micro">short thoughts, notes, links, and musings</a>.</p>
<p>I've been thinking about this for a while, but the amount of work involved in modifying all of the parts of my site that handle the three different content types was daunting. Then this evening I tried running my blog's source code (using <a href="https://github.com/simonw/files-to-prompt">files-to-prompt</a> and <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a>) through <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/25/gemini/">the new Gemini 2.5 Pro</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>files-to-prompt <span class="pl-c1">.</span> -e py -c <span class="pl-k">|</span> \
  llm -m gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 -s \
  <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>I want to add a new type of content called a Note,</span>
<span class="pl-s">  similar to quotation and bookmark and entry but it</span>
<span class="pl-s">  only has a markdown text body. Output all of the</span>
<span class="pl-s">  code I need to add for that feature and tell me</span>
<span class="pl-s">  which files to add  the code to.<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre></div>

<p>Gemini gave me <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/6d9fb3e33e7105d391a31367d6a235de#response">a detailed 13 step plan</a> covering all of the tedious changes I'd been avoiding having to figure out!</p>
<p>The code <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/pull/527">is in this PR</a>, which touched 18 different files. The whole project took around 45 minutes start to finish.</p>
<p>(I used Claude to <a href="https://claude.ai/share/17656d59-6f52-471e-8aeb-6abbe1464471">brainstorm names</a> for the feature - I had it come up with possible nouns and then "rank those by least pretentious to most pretentious", and "notes" came out on top.)</p>
<p>This is now far too long for a note and should really be upgraded to an entry, but I need to post a first note to make sure everything is working as it should.</p>

## Introducing 4o Image Generation

date: 2025-03-25, updated: 2025-03-25, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-4o-image-generation/">Introducing 4o Image Generation</a></strong></p>
When OpenAI first announced GPT-4o <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/13/gpt-4o/">back in May 2024</a> one of the most exciting features was true multi-modality in that it could both input <em>and</em>  output audio and images. The "o" stood for "omni", and the image output examples <a href="https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/">in that launch post</a> looked really impressive.</p>
<p>It's taken them over ten months (and Gemini <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/experiment-with-gemini-20-flash-native-image-generation/">beat them to it</a>) but today they're finally making those image generation abilities available, live right now in ChatGPT for paying customers.</p>
<p>My test prompt for any model that can manipulate incoming images is "Turn this into a selfie with a bear", because you should never take a selfie with a bear! I fed ChatGPT <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/selfie.jpg">this selfie</a> and got back this result:</p>
<p><img alt="It's a selfie, there's a grizzly bear over my shoulder smiling." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/selfie-with-a-bear.jpg" /></p>
<p>That's pretty great! It mangled the text on my T-Shirt (which says "LAWRENCE.COM" in a creative font) and added a second visible AirPod. It's very clearly me though, and that's definitely a bear.</p>
<p>There are plenty more examples in <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-4o-image-generation/">OpenAI's launch post</a>, but as usual the most interesting details are tucked away in <a href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-image-generation-system-card-addendum/">the updates to the system card</a>. There's lots in there about their approach to safety and bias, including a section on "Ahistorical and Unrealistic Bias" which feels inspired by Gemini's <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-image-generation-issue/">embarrassing early missteps</a>.</p>
<p>One section that stood out to me is their approach to images of public figures. The new policy is much more permissive than for DALL-E - highlights mine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4o image generation is capable, in many instances, of generating a depiction of a public figure based solely on a text prompt.</p>
<p><strong>At launch, we are not blocking the capability to generate adult public figures</strong> but are instead implementing the same safeguards that we have implemented for editing images of photorealistic uploads of people. For instance, this includes seeking to block the generation of photorealistic images of public figures who are minors and of material that violates our policies related to violence, hateful imagery, instructions for illicit activities, erotic content, and other areas. <strong>Public figures who wish for their depiction not to be generated can opt out</strong>.</p>
<p>This approach is more fine-grained than the way we dealt with public figures in our DALL¬∑E series of models, where we used technical mitigations intended to prevent any images of a public figure from being generated. <strong>This change opens the possibility of helpful and beneficial uses in areas like educational, historical, satirical and political speech</strong>. After launch, we will continue to monitor usage of this capability, evaluating our policies, and will adjust them if needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given that "public figures who wish for their depiction not to be generated can opt out" I wonder if we'll see a stampede of public figures to do exactly that!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: There's significant confusion right now over this new feature because it is being rolled out gradually but older ChatGPT can still generate images using DALL-E instead... and there is no visual indication in the ChatGPT UI explaining which image generation method it used!</p>
<p>OpenAI made the same mistake last year <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/15/chatgpt-in-4o-mode/">when they announced ChatGPT advanced voice mode</a> but failed to clarify that ChatGPT was still running the previous, less impressive voice implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: Images created with DALL-E through the ChatGPT web interface now show a note with a warning:</p>
<p><img alt="Created with DALL-E with an information icon. Clicking it reveals DALL-E is OpenAI's legacy image generation model. A new model is rolling out in ChatGPT soon." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/dall-e-warning.jpg" />

## Putting Gemini 2.5 Pro through its paces

date: 2025-03-25, updated: 2025-03-25, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p>There's a new release from Google Gemini this morning: <a href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-thinking-updates-march-2025/#gemini-2-5-thinking">the first in the Gemini 2.5</a> series. Google call it "a thinking model, designed to tackle increasingly complex problems". It's already sat at the top of the <a href="https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard">LM Arena leaderboard</a>, and from initial impressions looks like it may deserve that top spot.</p>
<p>I just released <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini/releases/tag/0.16">llm-gemini 0.16</a> adding support for the new model to my <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> command-line tool. Let's try it out.</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="the-pelican-riding-a-bicycle">The pelican riding a bicycle</h4>
<p>First up, my classic <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/pelican-riding-a-bicycle/">generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle</a> prompt.</p>

<p>It's pretty solid!</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemini-2.5-pro-pelican.jpg" alt="The pelican is perched at an angle which suggests an effort at having it make contact with the pedals. It has a good large beak." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/c34f7f0c94afcbeab77e170511f6f51f">the full transcript</a>.</p>
<p>This task is meant to be almost impossible: pelicans are the wrong shape to ride bicycles! Given that, I think this is a good attempt - I like it slightly better than my previous favourite <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/24/claude-37-sonnet-and-claude-code/">Claude 3.7 Sonnet</a>, which produced this a month ago:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/pelican-claude-3.7-sonnet.svg" alt="The bicycle has pokes but the pedal is in the wrong place, and the pelican perches uncomfortably on the seat with weird looking wings." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<h4 id="transcribing-audio">Transcribing audio</h4>
<p>I had <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/russian-pelican-in-spanish.mp3">an MP3</a> lying around from <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/26/russian-spanish-pelican/">a previous experiment</a> which mixes English and Spanish. I tried running it with the prompt <code>transcribe</code> to see what would happen:</p>

}</pre></div>
<p>A spot check of the timestamps showed them in the right place. Gemini 2.5 supports long context prompts so it's possible this works well for much longer audio files - it would be interesting to dig deeper and try that out.</p>
<h4 id="bounding-boxes">Bounding boxes</h4>
<p>One of my favourite features of previous Gemini models is their support for bounding boxes: you can prompt them to return boxes around objects in images.</p>
<p>I built a separate tool for experimenting with this feature in August last year, which I described in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Aug/26/gemini-bounding-box-visualization/">Building a tool showing how Gemini Pro can return bounding boxes for objects in images</a>. I've now upgraded that tool to add support the new model.</p>
<p>You can access it at <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/gemini-bbox">tools.simonwillison.net/gemini-bbox</a> - you'll need to provide your own Gemini API key which is sent directly to their API from your browser (it won't be logged by an intermediary).</p>
<p>I tried it out on <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/challenging-pelicans.jpg">a challenging photograph</a> of some pelicans... and it worked extremely well:</p>
<p>My prompt was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Return bounding boxes around pelicans as JSON arrays [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax]</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Gemini models are all trained to return bounding boxes scaled between 0 and 100. My tool knows how to convert those back to the same dimensions as the input image.</p>
<p>Here's what the visualized result looked like:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemini-pelicans-bbox.jpg" alt="Pelicans with bounding boxes around them" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>It got almost all of them! I like how it didn't draw a box around the one egret that had made it into the photo.</p>
<h4 id="characteristics">More characteristics of the model</h4>

<p>Here's the <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models#gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25">official model listing</a> in the Gemini docs. Key details:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Input token limit: 1,000,000</li>
  <li>Output token limit: 64,000 - this is a <em>huge</em> upgrade, all of the other listed models have 8,192 for this (correction: <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/flash-thinking/">Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking</a> also had a 64,000 output length)</li>
  <li>Knowledge cut-off: January 2025 - an improvement on Gemini 2.0's August 2024</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="gemini-2-5-pro-is-a-very-strong-new-model">Gemini 2.5 Pro is a very strong new model</h4>
<p>I've hardly scratched the surface when it comes to trying out Gemini 2.5 Pro so far. How's its creative writing? Factual knowledge about the world? Can it write great code in Python, JavaScript, Rust and more?</p>
<p>The Gemini family of models have capabilities that set them apart from other models:</p>
<ul>
<li>Long context length - Gemini 2.5 Pro supports up to 1 million tokens</li>
<li>Audio input - something which few other models support, certainly not at this length and with this level of timestamp accuracy</li>
<li>Accurate bounding box detection for image inputs</li>
</ul>
<p>My experiments so far with these capabilities indicate that Gemini 2.5 Pro really is a very strong new model. I'm looking forward to exploring more of what it can do.</p>

<h4 id="update-it-s-very-good-at-code">Update: it's very good at code</h4>
<p>I spent this evening trying it out for coding tasks, and it's very, very impressive. I'm seeing results for Python that feel comparable to my previous favourite Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and appear to be benefitting from Gemini 2.5 Pro's default reasoning mode and long context.</p>
<p>I've been wanting to add a new content type of "notes" to my blog for quite a while now, but I was put off by the anticipated tedium of all of the different places in the codebase that would need to be updated.</p>
<p>That feature is now live. <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/26/notes/">Here are my notes</a> on creating that notes feature using Gemini 2.5 Pro. It crunched through my entire codebase and figured out all of the places I needed to change - 18 files in total, as you can see in <a href="https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog/pull/527/files">the resulting PR</a>. The whole project took about 45 minutes from start to finish - averaging less than three minutes per file I had to modify.</p>
<p>I've thrown a whole bunch of other coding challenges at it, and the bottleneck on evaluating them has become my own mental capacity to review the resulting code!</p>
<p>Here's another, more complex example. This hasn't resulted in actual running code yet but it took a big bite out of an architectural design problem I've been stewing on for a very long time.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM project</a> needs support for tools - a way to teach different LLMs how to request tool execution, then have those tools (implemented in Python) run and return their results back to the models.</p>

<p>Designing this is really hard, because I need to create an abstraction that works across multiple different model providers, each powered by a different plugin.</p>

<p>Could Gemini 2.5 Pro help unblock me by proposing an architectural approach that might work?</p>

<p>I started by combining the Python and Markdown files for my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-utils">sqlite-utils</a>, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm">llm</a>, <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini">llm-gemini</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic">llm-anthropic</a> repositories into one big document:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>files-to-prompt sqlite-utils llm llm-gemini llm-anthropic -e md -e py -c</pre></div>
<p>Piping it through <a href="https://github.com/simonw/ttok">ttok</a> showed that to be 316,098 tokens (using the OpenAI tokenizer, but the Gemini tokenizer is likely a similar number).</p>
<p>Then I fed that all into Gemini 2.5 Pro with the following prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Provide a detailed design proposal for adding tool calling support to LLM</p>
<p>Different model plugins will have different ways of executing tools, but LLM itself should provide both a Python and a CLI abstraction over these differences.</p>
<p>Tool calling involves passing tool definitions to a model, the model then replies with tools it would like executed, the harness code then executes those and passes the result back to the model and continues in a loop until the model stops requesting tools. This should happen as part of the existing llm.Conversation mechanism.</p>
<p>At the Python layer tools should be provided as Python functions that use type hints, which can then be converted into JSON schema using Pydantic - similar to how the existing schema= mechanism works.</p>
<p>For the CLI option tools will be provided as an option passed to the command, similar to how the sqlite-utils convert CLI mechanism works.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've been thinking about this problem for over a year now. <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/481f46a779f20d8650b4fc5854f070c5">Gemini 2.5 Pro's response</a> isn't exactly what I'm going to do, but it did include a flurry of genuinely useful suggestions to help me craft my final approach.</p>
<p>I hadn't thought about the need for asyncio support for tool functions at all, so this idea from Gemini 2.5 Pro was very welcome:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>AsyncConversation.prompt()</code> method will mirror the synchronous API, accepting the <code>tools</code> parameter and handling the tool calling loop using <code>async/await</code> for tool execution if the tool functions themselves are async. If tool functions are synchronous, they will be run in a thread pool executor via <code>asyncio.to_thread</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Watching Gemini crunch through some of the more complex problems I've been dragging my heels on reminded me of something Harper Reed wrote <a href="https://harper.blog/2025/02/16/my-llm-codegen-workflow-atm/">about his   workflow with LLMs for code</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My hack to-do list is empty because I built everything. I keep thinking of new things and knocking them out while watching a movie or something.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've been stressing quite a bit about my backlog of incomplete projects recently. I don't think Gemini 2.5 Pro is quite going to work through all of them while I'm watching TV, but it does feel like it's going to help make a significant dent in them.</p>

    <b>We deployed 100 reinforcement learning (RL)-controlled cars into rush-hour highway traffic to smooth congestion and reduce fuel consumption for everyone.</b> Our goal is to tackle <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNokBgtSUvQ" target="_blank">"stop-and-go" waves</a>, those frustrating slowdowns and speedups that usually have no clear cause but lead to congestion and significant energy waste. To train efficient flow-smoothing controllers, we built fast, data-driven simulations that RL agents interact with, learning to maximize energy efficiency while maintaining throughput and operating safely around human drivers.
</p>
<p>    
    Overall, a small proportion of well-controlled autonomous vehicles (AVs) is enough to significantly improve traffic flow and fuel efficiency for all drivers on the road. Moreover, the trained controllers are designed to be deployable on most modern vehicles, operating in a decentralized manner and relying on standard radar sensors. In our <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10858625" target="_blank">latest paper</a>, we explore the challenges of deploying RL controllers on a large-scale, from simulation to the field, during this 100-car experiment.

    <br />
    <i>A stop-and-go wave moving backwards through highway traffic.</i>
</p>

<p>If you drive, you‚Äôve surely experienced the frustration of stop-and-go waves, those seemingly inexplicable traffic slowdowns that appear out of nowhere and then suddenly clear up. These waves are often caused by small fluctuations in our driving behavior that get amplified through the flow of traffic. We naturally adjust our speed based on the vehicle in front of us. If the gap opens, we speed up to keep up. If they brake, we also slow down. But due to our nonzero reaction time, we might brake just a bit harder than the vehicle in front. The next driver behind us does the same, and this keeps amplifying. Over time, what started as an insignificant slowdown turns into a full stop further back in traffic. These waves move backward through the traffic stream, leading to significant drops in energy efficiency due to frequent accelerations, accompanied by increased CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and accident risk.</p>

<p>And this isn‚Äôt an isolated phenomenon! These waves are ubiquitous on busy roads when the traffic density exceeds a critical threshold. So how can we address this problem? Traditional approaches like ramp metering and variable speed limits attempt to manage traffic flow, but they often require costly infrastructure and centralized coordination. A more scalable approach is to use AVs, which can dynamically adjust their driving behavior in real-time. However, simply inserting AVs among human drivers isn‚Äôt enough: they must also drive in a smarter way that makes traffic better for everyone, which is where RL comes in.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 50px;">

    <br />
    <i><b>Fundamental diagram of traffic flow.</b> The number of cars on the road (density) affects how much traffic is moving forward (flow). At low density, adding more cars increases flow because more vehicles can pass through. But beyond a critical threshold, cars start blocking each other, leading to congestion, where adding more cars actually slows down overall movement.</i>
</p>

<h2 id="reinforcement-learning-for-wave-smoothing-avs">Reinforcement learning for wave-smoothing AVs</h2>

<p>RL is a powerful control approach where an agent learns to maximize a reward signal through interactions with an environment. The agent collects experience through trial and error, learns from its mistakes, and improves over time. In our case, the environment is a mixed-autonomy traffic scenario, where AVs learn driving strategies to dampen stop-and-go waves and reduce fuel consumption for both themselves and nearby human-driven vehicles.</p>

<p>Training these RL agents requires fast simulations with realistic traffic dynamics that can replicate highway stop-and-go behavior. To achieve this, we leveraged experimental data collected on Interstate 24 (I-24) near Nashville, Tennessee, and used it to build simulations where vehicles replay highway trajectories, creating unstable traffic that AVs driving behind them learn to smooth out.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 50px;">
    <video autoplay="" muted="" playsinline="" disableRemotePlayback="" loop="" style="width: 100%; margin: 0; padding: 0; outline: none; border: none; background: transparent; display: block; border-radius: 5px" cover="https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/rl_av_smoothing/simulation.png">

    </video>
    <br />
    <i>Simulation replaying a highway trajectory that exhibits several stop-and-go waves.</i>
</p>

<p>We designed the AVs with deployment in mind, ensuring that they can operate using only basic sensor information about themselves and the vehicle in front. The observations consist of the AV‚Äôs speed, the speed of the leading vehicle, and the space gap between them. Given these inputs, the RL agent then prescribes either an instantaneous acceleration or a desired speed for the AV. The key advantage of using only these local measurements is that the RL controllers can be deployed on most modern vehicles in a decentralized way, without requiring additional infrastructure.</p>

<h3 id="reward-design">Reward design</h3>

<p>The most challenging part is designing a reward function that, when maximized, aligns with the different objectives that we desire the AVs to achieve:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Wave smoothing:</strong> Reduce stop-and-go oscillations.</li>
  <li><strong>Energy efficiency:</strong> Lower fuel consumption for all vehicles, not just AVs.</li>
  <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Ensure reasonable following distances and avoid abrupt braking.</li>
  <li><strong>Driving comfort:</strong> Avoid aggressive accelerations and decelerations.</li>
  <li><strong>Adherence to human driving norms:</strong> Ensure a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù driving behavior that doesn‚Äôt make surrounding drivers uncomfortable.</li>
</ul>

<p>Balancing these objectives together is difficult, as suitable coefficients for each term must be found. For instance, if minimizing fuel consumption dominates the reward, RL AVs learn to come to a stop in the middle of the highway because that is energy optimal. To prevent this, we introduced dynamic minimum and maximum gap thresholds to ensure safe and reasonable behavior while optimizing fuel efficiency. We also penalized the fuel consumption of human-driven vehicles behind the AV to discourage it from learning a selfish behavior that optimizes energy savings for the AV at the expense of surrounding traffic. Overall, we aim to strike a balance between energy savings and having a reasonable and safe driving behavior.</p>

<h3 id="simulation-results">Simulation results</h3>

    <br />
    <i>Illustration of the dynamic minimum and maximum gap thresholds, within which the AV can operate freely to smooth traffic as efficiently as possible.</i>
</p>

<p>The typical behavior learned by the AVs is to maintain slightly larger gaps than human drivers, allowing them to absorb upcoming, possibly abrupt, traffic slowdowns more effectively. In simulation, this approach resulted in significant fuel savings of up to 20% across all road users in the most congested scenarios, with fewer than 5% of AVs on the road. And these AVs don‚Äôt have to be special vehicles! They can simply be standard consumer cars equipped with a smart adaptive cruise control (ACC), which is what we tested at scale.</p>

</p>

<p>Given the promising simulation results, the natural next step was to bridge the gap from simulation to the highway. We took the trained RL controllers and deployed them on 100 vehicles on the I-24 during peak traffic hours over several days. This large-scale experiment, which we called the MegaVanderTest, is the largest mixed-autonomy traffic-smoothing experiment ever conducted.</p>

<p>Before deploying RL controllers in the field, we trained and evaluated them extensively in simulation and validated them on the hardware. Overall, the steps towards deployment involved:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Training in data-driven simulations:</strong> We used highway traffic data from I-24 to create a training environment with realistic wave dynamics, then validate the trained agent‚Äôs performance and robustness in a variety of new traffic scenarios.</li>
  <li><strong>Deployment on hardware:</strong> After being validated in robotics software, the trained controller is uploaded onto the car and is able to control the set speed of the vehicle. We operate through the vehicle‚Äôs on-board cruise control, which acts as a lower-level safety controller.</li>
  <li><strong>Modular control framework:</strong> One key challenge during the test was not having access to the leading vehicle information sensors. To overcome this, the RL controller was integrated into a hierarchical system, the MegaController, which combines a speed planner guide that accounts for downstream traffic conditions, with the RL controller as the final decision maker.</li>
  <li><strong>Validation on hardware:</strong> The RL agents were designed to operate in an environment where most vehicles were human-driven, requiring robust policies that adapt to unpredictable behavior. We verify this by driving the RL-controlled vehicles on the road under careful human supervision, making changes to the control based on feedback.</li>
</ul>

        <i style="font-size: 0.9rem; display: block; text-align: center; margin-top: 5px;">Each of the 100 cars is connected to a Raspberry Pi, on which the RL controller (a small neural network) is deployed.</i>

        <i style="font-size: 0.9rem; display: block; text-align: center; margin-top: 5px;">The RL controller directly controls the onboard adaptive cruise control (ACC) system, setting its speed and desired following distance.</i>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Once validated, the RL controllers were deployed on 100 cars and driven on I-24 during morning rush hour. Surrounding traffic was unaware of the experiment, ensuring unbiased driver behavior. Data was collected during the experiment from dozens of overhead cameras placed along the highway, which led to the extraction of millions of individual vehicle trajectories through a computer vision pipeline. Metrics computed on these trajectories indicate a trend of reduced fuel consumption around AVs, as expected from simulation results and previous smaller validation deployments. For instance, we can observe that the closer people are driving behind our AVs, the less fuel they appear to consume on average (which is calculated using a calibrated energy model):</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0;">
    <img src="https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/rl_av_smoothing/fuel_data.png" width="80%" />
    <br />
    <i>Average fuel consumption as a function of distance behind the nearest engaged RL-controlled AV in the downstream traffic. As human drivers get further away behind AVs, their average fuel consumption increases.</i>
</p>

<p>Another way to measure the impact is to measure the variance of the speeds and accelerations: the lower the variance, the less amplitude the waves should have, which is what we observe from the field test data. Overall, although getting precise measurements from a large amount of camera video data is complicated, we observe a trend of 15 to 20% of energy savings around our controlled cars.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 0;">
    <img src="https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/rl_av_smoothing/data_scatter.png" width="50%" />
    <br />
    <i>Data points from all vehicles on the highway over a single day of the experiment, plotted in speed-acceleration space. The cluster to the left of the red line represents congestion, while the one on the right corresponds to free flow. We observe that the congestion cluster is smaller when AVs are present, as measured by computing the area of a soft convex envelope or by fitting a Gaussian kernel.</i>
</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>

<p>The 100-car field operational test was decentralized, with no explicit cooperation or communication between AVs, reflective of current autonomy deployment, and bringing us one step closer to smoother, more energy-efficient highways. Yet, there is still vast potential for improvement. Scaling up simulations to be faster and more accurate with better human-driving models is crucial for bridging the simulation-to-reality gap. Equipping AVs with additional traffic data, whether through advanced sensors or centralized planning, could further improve the performance of the controllers. For instance, while multi-agent RL is promising for improving cooperative control strategies, it remains an open question how enabling explicit communication between AVs over 5G networks could further improve stability and further mitigate stop-and-go waves. Crucially, our controllers integrate seamlessly with existing adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems, making field deployment feasible at scale. The more vehicles equipped with smart traffic-smoothing control, the fewer waves we‚Äôll see on our roads, meaning less pollution and fuel savings for everyone!</p>

It's a fun way of running complex screen-scraping routines as part of a terminal session, or even chained together with other commands using pipes.</p>
<p>The <code>-i/--input</code> option lets you load that JavaScript from a file on disk - but now you can also use a <code>gh:</code> prefix to specify loading code from GitHub instead.</p>
<p>To quote <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/releases/tag/1.8">the release notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>shot-scraper javascript</code> can now optionally <a href="https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/en/stable/javascript.html#running-javascript-from-github">load scripts hosted on GitHub</a> via the new <code>gh:</code> prefix to the <code>shot-scraper javascript -i/--input</code> option. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper/issues/173">#173</a></p>
<p>Scripts can be referenced as <code>gh:username/repo/path/to/script.js</code> or, if the GitHub user has created a dedicated <code>shot-scraper-scripts</code> repository and placed scripts in the root of it, using <code>gh:username/name-of-script</code>.</p>
<p>For example, to run this <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper-scripts/blob/main/readability.js">readability.js</a> script against any web page you can use the following:</p>
<pre><code>shot-scraper javascript --input gh:simonw/readability \
  https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/24/qwen25-vl-32b/
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/60e196ec39a5a75dcabfd75fbe911a4c">output from that example</a> starts like this:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-json"><pre>{

<p>My <a href="https://github.com/simonw/shot-scraper-scripts">simonw/shot-scraper-scripts</a> repo only has that one file in it so far, but I'm looking forward to growing that collection and hopefully seeing other people create and share their own <code>shot-scraper-scripts</code> repos as well.</p>
<p>This feature is an imitation of <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/809">a similar feature</a> that's coming in the next release of LLM.

## microsoft/playwright-mcp

date: 2025-03-25, updated: 2025-03-25, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp">microsoft/playwright-mcp</a></strong></p>
The Playwright team at Microsoft have released an MCP (<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp">Model Context Protocol</a>) server wrapping Playwright, and it's pretty fascinating.</p>
<p>They implemented it on top of the Chrome accessibility tree, so MCP clients (such as the Claude Desktop app) can use it to drive an automated browser and use the accessibility tree to read and navigate pages that they visit.</p>
<p>Trying it out is quite easy if you have Claude Desktop and Node.js installed already. Edit your <code>claude_desktop_config.json</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
</code></pre>
<p>And add this:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-json"><pre>{
  <span class="pl-ent">"mcpServers"</span>: {
    <span class="pl-ent">"playwright"</span>: {
      <span class="pl-ent">"command"</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>npx<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>,
      <span class="pl-ent">"args"</span>: [
        <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>@playwright/mcp@latest<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>
      ]
    }
  }
}</pre></div>

<p>Now when you launch Claude Desktop various new browser automation tools will be available to it, and you can tell Claude to navigate to a website and interact with it.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of Claude interface showing a conversation about Datasette. The interface shows Claude responding to a user (SW) after navigating to datasette.io. Claude's response includes page details (URL: https://datasette.io/, Title: Datasette: An open source multi-tool for exploring and publishing data) and a summary of what's visible on the site: a description of Datasette as an open-source tool for exploring and publishing data, the tagline &quot;Find stories in data&quot;, navigation options, and features including exploratory data analysis, instant data publishing, and rapid prototyping." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/claude-playwright.jpg" /></p>
<p>I ran the following to get a list of the available tools:</p>
<pre><code>cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp
cd playwright-mcp/src/tools
files-to-prompt . | llm -m claude-3.7-sonnet \
  'Output a detailed description of these tools'
</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/69200999149221c549c1f62e7befa20f">full output is here</a>, but here's the truncated tool list:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Navigation Tools (<code>common.ts</code>)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>browser_navigate</strong>: Navigate to a specific URL</li>
<li><strong>browser_go_back</strong>: Navigate back in browser history</li>
<li><strong>browser_go_forward</strong>: Navigate forward in browser history</li>
<li><strong>browser_wait</strong>: Wait for a specified time in seconds</li>
<li><strong>browser_press_key</strong>: Press a keyboard key</li>
<li><strong>browser_save_as_pdf</strong>: Save current page as PDF</li>
<li><strong>browser_close</strong>: Close the current page</li>
</ul>
<h4>Screenshot and Mouse Tools (<code>screenshot.ts</code>)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>browser_screenshot</strong>: Take a screenshot of the current page</li>
<li><strong>browser_move_mouse</strong>: Move mouse to specific coordinates</li>
<li><strong>browser_click</strong> (coordinate-based): Click at specific x,y coordinates</li>
<li><strong>browser_drag</strong> (coordinate-based): Drag mouse from one position to another</li>
<li><strong>browser_type</strong> (keyboard): Type text and optionally submit</li>
</ul>
<h4>Accessibility Snapshot Tools (<code>snapshot.ts</code>)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>browser_snapshot</strong>: Capture accessibility structure of the page</li>
<li><strong>browser_click</strong> (element-based): Click on a specific element using accessibility reference</li>
<li><strong>browser_drag</strong> (element-based): Drag between two elements</li>
<li><strong>browser_hover</strong>: Hover over an element</li>
<li><strong>browser_type</strong> (element-based): Type text into a specific element</li>
</ul>

## Marginalia Search receives second nlnet grant

date: 2025-03-25, from: Marginallia log

I&rsquo;m happy and grateful to announce that the Marginalia Search project has been accepted for a second nlnet grant.
All the details are not yet finalized, but tentatively the grant will go toward addressing most of the items in the project roadmap for 2025.
I&rsquo;ve already been working full time on the project since summer 2023, and this grant secures additional development time, and extends the runway to a comfortable degree.

## Qwen2.5-VL-32B: Smarter and Lighter

date: 2025-03-24, updated: 2025-03-24, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-vl-32b/">Qwen2.5-VL-32B: Smarter and Lighter</a></strong></p>
The second big open weight LLM release from China today - the first being <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/24/deepseek/">DeepSeek v3-0324</a>.</p>
<p>Qwen's previous vision model was Qwen2.5 VL, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/27/qwen25-vl-qwen25-vl-qwen25-vl/">released in January</a> in 3B, 7B and 72B sizes.</p>
<p>Today's Apache 2.0 licensed release is a 32B model, which is quickly becoming my personal favourite model size - large enough to have GPT-4-class capabilities, but small enough that on my 64GB Mac there's still enough RAM for me to run other memory-hungry applications like Firefox and VS Code.</p>
<p>Qwen claim that the new model (when compared to their previous 2.5 VL family) can "align more closely with human preferences", is better at "mathematical reasoning" and provides "enhanced accuracy and detailed analysis in tasks such as image parsing, content recognition, and visual logic deduction".</p>
<p>They also offer some presumably carefully selected benchmark results showing it out-performing Gemma 3-27B, Mistral Small 3.1 24B and GPT-4o-0513 (there have been two more recent GPT-4o releases since that one, 2024-08-16 and 2024-11-20).</p>
<p>As usual, Prince Canuma had MLX versions of the models live within hours of the release, in <a href="https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct-4bit">4 bit</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct-6bit">6 bit</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct-8bit">8 bit</a>, and <a href="https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct-bf16">bf16</a> variants.</p>
<p>I ran the 4bit version (a 18GB model download) using <code>uv</code> and Prince's <a href="https://github.com/Blaizzy/mlx-vlm">mlx-vlm</a> like this:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>uv run --with <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>numpy&lt;2<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span> --with mlx-vlm \
  python -m mlx_vlm.generate \
    --model mlx-community/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct-4bit \
    --max-tokens 1000 \
    --temperature 0.0 \
    --prompt <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>Describe this image.<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> \
    --image Mpaboundrycdfw-1.png</pre></div>

<p>Here's the image:</p>
<p><img alt="A map image, described below" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/Mpaboundrycdfw-1.png" /></p>
<p>And here's the resulting description, which I found to be <em>very</em> impressive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This image appears to be a map highlighting specific areas along the coastline, likely in California, based on the geographical features and place names. Here is a detailed description of the image:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Geographic Features</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The map shows a section of the coastline, with land on the right and the sea on the left.</li>
<li>The land area includes parts of SanMateo County, as noted in the top-right corner.</li>
<li>The coastline features several named locations, including:
<ul>
<li><strong>Point Montara</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pillar Point</strong></li>
<li><strong>Kings Rock</strong></li>
<li><strong>VicenteCreek</strong></li>
<li><strong>DennistonCreek</strong></li>
<li><strong>State Beach</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Highlighted Areas</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The map contains two distinct areas marked with different colors:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Red Area (Top Section)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Labeled as "MONTARA" and "MONTARA M R" (possibly referring to a "Marine Reserves" or similar protected area).</li>
<li>This area is marked with a dark red color and extends from the coastline inland.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Blue Area (Bottom Section)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Labeled as "PILLAR" and "PILLAR P O I N T" along with "SMCA" (Special Management Area).</li>
<li>This area is marked with a blue color and is located closer to the coastline, including the area around "Pillar Point."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Depth Contours</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The map includes depth markings in the sea, indicating the bathymetrical features:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>20 fathom (fm) line</strong> is marked in the upper-left part of the sea.</li>
<li>
<strong>10 fathom (fm) line</strong> is marked closer to the coastline.</li>
<li>
<strong>30 fathom (fm) line</strong> is marked further out to sea.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Other Features</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>State Beach</strong>: Marked near the top-right, indicating a protected recreational area.</li>
<li>
<strong>Kings Rock</strong>: A prominent feature near the coastline, likely a rocky outcropping.</li>
<li>
<strong>Creeks</strong>: The map shows several creeks, including <strong>VicenteCreek</strong> and <strong>DennistonCreek</strong>, which flow into the sea.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Protected Areas</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The map highlights specific protected areas:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Marine Reserves</strong>:
<ul>
<li>"MONTARA M R" (Marine Reserves) in red.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Special Management Area (SMCA)</strong>
<ul>
<li>"PILLAR P O I N T" in blue, indicating a Special Management Area.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Grid and Coordinates</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The map includes a grid with latitude and longitude markings:
<ul>
<li>Latitude ranges from approximately 37¬∞25'N to 37¬∞35'N.</li>
<li>Longitude ranges from approximately 122¬∞22.5'W to 122¬∞35.5'W.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Topography</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The land area shows topographic features, including elevations and vegetation, with green areas indicating higher elevations or vegetated land.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Other Labels</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>"SMR"</strong>: Likely stands for "State Managed Reserves."</li>
<li>
<strong>"SMCA"</strong>: Likely stands for "Special Management Control Area."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, this map highlights specific protected areas along the coastline, including a red "Marine Reserves" area and a blue "Special Management Area" near "Pillar Point." The map also includes depth markings, geographical features, and place names, providing a detailed view of the region's natural and protected areas.</p>

Perhaps even worse is that as Apple stands still, software development is moving forward faster than ever before.

## deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324

date: 2025-03-24, updated: 2025-03-24, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324">deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324</a></strong></p>
Chinese AI lab DeepSeek just released the latest version of their enormous DeepSeek v3 model, baking the release date into the name <code>DeepSeek-V3-0324</code>.</p>
<p>The license is MIT (that's new - previous DeepSeek v3 had a custom license), the README is empty and the release adds up a to a total of 641 GB of files, mostly of the form <code>model-00035-of-000163.safetensors</code>.</p>
<p>The model only came out a few hours ago and MLX developer Awni Hannun already <a href="https://twitter.com/awnihannun/status/1904177084609827054">has it running</a> at &gt;20 tokens/second on a 512GB M3 Ultra Mac Studio ($9,499 of ostensibly consumer-grade hardware) via <a href="https://pypi.org/project/mlx-lm/">mlx-lm</a> and this <a href="https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/DeepSeek-V3-0324-4bit">mlx-community/DeepSeek-V3-0324-4bit</a> 4bit quantization, which reduces the on-disk size to 352 GB.</p>
<p>I think that means if you have that machine you can run it with my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mlx">llm-mlx</a> plugin like this, but I've not tried myself!</p>
<pre><code>llm mlx download-model mlx-community/DeepSeek-V3-0324-4bit
llm chat -m mlx-community/DeepSeek-V3-0324-4bit
</code></pre>
<p>The new model is also <a href="https://openrouter.ai/deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free">listed on OpenRouter</a>. You can try a chat at <a href="https://openrouter.ai/chat?models=deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free">openrouter.ai/chat?models=deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free</a>.</p>
<p>Here's what the chat interface <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/3ce2bf5836743dfaf07d994578b261ba">gave me</a> for "Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle":</p>
<p><img alt="There's a pelican, and a bicycle, but both of them look disassembled." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/deepseek-v3-pelican.jpg" /></p>
<p>I have two API keys with OpenRouter - one of them worked with the model, the other gave me a <code>No endpoints found matching your data policy</code> error - I think because I had a setting on that key disallowing models from training on my activity. The key that worked was a free key with no attached billing credentials.</p>
<p>For my working API key the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-openrouter">llm-openrouter</a> plugin let me run a prompt like this:</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-openrouter
llm keys set openrouter
# Paste key here
llm -m openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free "best fact about a pelican"
</code></pre>
<p>Here's that "best fact" - the terminal output included Markdown and an emoji combo, here that's rendered.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the most fascinating facts about pelicans is their <strong>unique throat pouch</strong>, called a <strong>gular sac</strong>, which can hold up to <strong>3 gallons (11 liters) of water</strong>‚Äîthree times more than their stomach!  </p>
<p>Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs amazing:<br />
- <strong>Fishing Tool</strong>: They use it like a net to scoop up fish, then drain the water before swallowing.<br />
- <strong>Cooling Mechanism</strong>: On hot days, pelicans flutter the pouch to stay cool by evaporating water.<br />
- <strong>Built-in "Shopping Cart"</strong>: Some species even use it to carry food back to their chicks.  </p>
<p>Bonus fact: Pelicans often <strong>fish cooperatively</strong>, herding fish into shallow water for an easy catch.  </p>
<p>Would you like more cool pelican facts? üê¶üåä</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In putting this post together I <a href="https://claude.ai/share/fc65bf9b-ae2d-4b23-bd09-ed0d54ff4b56">got Claude</a> to build me <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/huggingface-storage">this new tool</a> for finding the total on-disk size of a Hugging Face repository, which is available in their API but not currently displayed on their website.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Here's a notable independent benchmark <a href="https://twitter.com/paulgauthier/status/1904304052500148423">from Paul Gauthier</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DeepSeek's new V3 scored 55% on aider's <a href="https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/">polyglot benchmark</a>, significantly improving over the prior version. It's the #2 non-thinking/reasoning model, behind only Sonnet 3.7. V3 is competitive with thinking models like R1 &amp; o3-mini.</p>

## Newsboat 2.39 is out

date: 2025-03-23, updated: 2025-03-23, from: Newsboat News


            <p>
                The new key-binding system mentioned in the previous entry is
                finally here! After years of work, done primarily by Dennis van
                der Schagt, we now have a <code>bind</code> command that:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        can create multi-key bindings, i.e. one can bind not
                        just single letters (with Control or Shift), but also
                        sequences of letters (each with their own modifiers);
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        allows each binding to execute multiple actions, just
                        like our existing <code>macro</code> command. Unlike macros,
                        <code>bind</code> doesn't require a "macro prefix",
                            so one can finally bind a sequence of operations
                            to a <emph>single</emph> key;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        allows adding documentation strings to each binding,
                        which are then shown in the help dialog. This again is
                        an improvement upon macros, which had no descriptions and
                        didn't have a way for the user to provide their own;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        adds alternative syntax for keys. Instead of the usual
                        <code>^R</code> syntax, one can now use
                        <code>&lt;C-r&gt;</code> a la Tmux or Emacs. Hopefully
                        this makes multi-key bindings easier to read.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                The feature is very new, and probably contains bugs. Please
                report them! In fact, it's so new that we didn't have time to
                finish the corresponding <code>unbind</code> command LOL.
                However, since Newsboat doesn't have any multi-key bindings
                by default, <code>unbind</code> was deemed to not be a release blocker.
            </p>

            <p>
                The new feature also has a limitation in that multi-key bindings
                that have the same prefix must have the same length. In other
                words, it's fine to have <code>abc</code> and <code>abx</code>
                bound simultaneously, but it's not possible to bind both
                <code>ab</code> and <code>abc</code> at the same time.
                This is to avoid an ambiguity when the prefix is typed;
                in that case Newsboat would have to decide somehow
                if the next key is going to be <code>c</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
                We are all very proud of this feature, and eagerly awaiting your
                feedback! Please try it, and open an issue if something doesn't
                work or could be improved.
            </p>

            <p>
                One more thing: we now require a compiler that accepts
                <code>-std=c++17</code> flag. In other words, we dropped Clang 4
                support. This is due to libicu 75 requiring C++17; we depend on
                this library via libxml2, and the requirement bleeds through to
                us because we're indirectly including some of libicu header files.
            </p>

            <p>
                Compilers without C++17 support are now considered deprecated.
                Future Newsboat releases will probably use some of C++17 features,
                at which point we'll drop support. If that's going to create
                problems for you, please file an issue.
            </p>

<p>I'm particularly frustrated because for a few glorious moments we had the chance at having ONE piece of AI-related terminology with a clear, widely accepted definition!</p>
<p>But it turns out people couldn't be trusted to read all the way to the end of Andrej's tweet, so now we are back to yet another term where different people assume it means different things</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Martin Fowler coined Semantic Diffusion in 2006 with this very clear definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Semantic diffusion occurs when you have a word that is coined by a person or group, often with a pretty good definition, but then gets spread through the wider community in a way that weakens that definition. This weakening risks losing the definition entirely - and with it any usefulness to the term.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What's happening with vibe coding right now is such a clear example of this effect in action! I've seen <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/5/prompt-injection-jailbreaking/">the same thing happen</a> to my own coinage <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Sep/12/prompt-injection/">prompt injection</a> over the past couple of years.</p>
<p>This kind of dillution of meaning is frustrating, but does appear to be inevitable. As Martin Fowler points out it's most likely to happen to popular terms - the more popular a term is the higher the chance a game of telephone will ensue where misunderstandings flourish as the chain continues to grow.</p>
<p>Andrej Karpathy, who <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383">coined</a> vibe coding, <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1903870973126045712">posted this</a> just now in reply to my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/">article</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good post! It will take some time to settle on definitions. Personally I use "vibe coding" when I feel like this dog. My iOS app last night being a good example. But I find that in practice I rarely go full out vibe coding, and more often I still look at the code, I add complexity slowly and I try to learn over time how the pieces work, to ask clarifying questions etc.</p>

<p>I love that vibe coding has an official illustrative GIF now!

## Next.js and the corrupt middleware: the authorizing artifact

date: 2025-03-23, updated: 2025-03-23, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://zhero-web-sec.github.io/research-and-things/nextjs-and-the-corrupt-middleware">Next.js and the corrupt middleware: the authorizing artifact</a></strong></p>
Good, detailed write-up of the Next.js vulnerability <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-29927">CVE-2025-29927</a> by Allam Rachid, one of the researchers who identified the issue.</p>
<p>The vulnerability is best illustrated by <a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/v12.0.7/packages/next/server/next-server.ts#L686">this code snippet</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-js"><pre><span class="pl-k">const</span> <span class="pl-s1">subreq</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s1">params</span><span class="pl-kos">.</span><span class="pl-c1">request</span><span class="pl-kos">.</span><span class="pl-c1">headers</span><span class="pl-kos">[</span><span class="pl-s">'x-middleware-subrequest'</span><span class="pl-kos">]</span><span class="pl-kos">;</span>

    <span class="pl-k">continue</span><span class="pl-kos">;</span>
  <span class="pl-kos">}</span>
<span class="pl-kos">}</span></pre></div>
<p>This was part of Next.js internals used to help avoid applying middleware recursively to requests that are re-dispatched through the framework.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it also meant that attackers could send a <code>x-middleware-subrequest</code> HTTP header with a colon-separated list of middleware names to skip. If a site used middleware to apply an authentication gate (as suggested <a href="https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/adding-authentication#protecting-your-routes-with-nextjs-middleware">in the Next.js documentation</a>) an attacker could bypass that authentication using this trick.</p>
<p>The vulnerability has been fixed in Next.js 15.2.3 - here's the <a href="https://nextjs.org/blog/cve-2025-29927">official release announcement</a> talking about the problem.
