<p>Every great romantic comedy has a moment where two characters collide, clash, or connect for the first time. That moment is a meet-cute – the heartbeat of any romantic comedy.&nbsp;<br><br>Meet-cutes set the tone, stakes, and emotional undercurrent for everything that follows the story. It’s where we, the audience, decide if we want to watch these characters fall in love. When done right, it can hook your viewer, define your characters, and spark a journey that feels both familiar and fresh.<br><br>Let’s break down what makes a meet-cute memorable, and how you can write one that stands out with some of our favorite examples.&nbsp;</p>
