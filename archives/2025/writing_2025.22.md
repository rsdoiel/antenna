## How To Write a Cold Open in Your Script

date: 2025-06-06, from: Final Draft blog

<div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"> 
 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/how-to-write-a-cold-open-in-your-script" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/Tim%20Roth%20and%20Amanda%20Plummer%20in%20Pulp%20Fiction.png" alt="Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer sitting in a booth at a breakfast diner in Pulp Fiction" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<p>What is a <span style="font-weight: bold;">cold open</span>?<br><br>A cold open is a storytelling technique commonly used in film and television, where the narrative dives directly into a scene—often a self-contained mini-story—before the opening credits or main plot unfold. These openings can range from just a few minutes to as long as 15 minutes in some feature films (such as the famous dialogue-free opening to Paul Thomas Anderson’s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469494/?ref_=fn_all_ttl_1" style="font-style: italic;">There Will Be Blood</a>), and they typically occur before any titles or credits appear on screen.<br><br>Arguably the most famous cold open scenes are the ones that begin each installment of the James Bond franchise. These sequences are like mini-movies in and of themselves, and have a self-contained narrative with a micro <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/three-act-structure-the-foundation-of-screenwriting">three act structure</a> (beginning, middle and end). Some other cold open examples are the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN0ftAFlnXg">diner prologue of</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN0ftAFlnXg" style="font-style: italic;">Pulp Fiction</a>, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vetKTtM7YyU">bank robbery in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Dark Knight</span></a><span style="font-style: italic;">,</span> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sn5SkCvPEYo">telephone call sequence that begins <span style="font-style: italic;">Scream</span></a>. All of these openings create intrigue and anticipation, and help to set the mood and tone of the film within a single scene.<br><br>In television, the cold open usually introduces the ‘A’ Story that is the primary plotline of the episode. For example, a police procedural is likely to begin with “the case” the detectives will have to solve (e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">Columbo</span> episodes usually start with the murder from the killer’s point of view, a technique also employed in <span style="font-style: italic;">Poker Face</span>). Comedic content is looser: cold opens can sometimes just be a funny one-off sequence, however, some sitcoms like <span style="font-style: italic;">It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</span> open with an introduction of the A Story (and sometimes also the B Story).<br><br>Regardless of the medium or <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/what-genre-is-my-screenplay">genre</a>, the main purpose of a cold open is to <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/5-tips-to-writing-a-great-opening">grab the attention</a> of the viewer so they’ll continue watching. In a world flooded with content, cold opens have become increasingly common, and in screenwriting, significant emphasis is now placed on the crucial first ten pages to hook in viewers.<br><br>However, the best cold opens aren’t just obligatory teasers: a cold open can also <span style="font-style: italic;">elevate the entire script</span>.</p>

## (S)Kin by Ibi Zoboi: Review by Gabino Iglesias

date: 2025-06-06, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>(S)Kin</strong>, Ibi Zoboi (Versify 978-0-06288-887-7, 400pp, hc) February 2025. Cover by Salena Barnes.</p>
<p>Ibi Zoboi’s <strong>(S)Kin </strong>is not the kind of book I would usually pick up. When reading YA, I mostly stick to horror. Also, I don’t come across many novels in verse, but when I do, I’m usually reading two dozen books at once and that gives me an excuse to not pick it up.

## ‘Karate Kid: Legends’ and the ‘Overcoming the Monster’ Archetype in Screenwriting

<p>According to Christopher Booker’s <em>The Seven Basic Plots</em>, there are really only seven types of stories that one can tell. While the <em>Karate Kid</em> story may seem deceptively simple, it has a strong concept behind it; in this case, the basic plot of Overcoming the Monster, which places the protagonist into a situation where they must defeat a threatening antagonist.</p>

## What is Dramatic Irony and How to Use It in Screenplays?

</div> 
<p>In the simplest terms, <span style="font-weight: bold;">dramatic irony</span> in storytelling is when the audience knows something the characters don’t. Oftentimes, the characters would have benefited from this knowledge and it would have taken them down a less troublesome or, in some cases, tragic path (also known as “tragic irony”).&nbsp;<br><br>Dramatic irony in storytelling is often achieved by showing or revealing something to the audience that one of the main characters hasn’t witnessed or heard (this is sometimes referred to as “proleptic irony”). There are many possibilities for what could happen in a story with dramatic irony, but firstly it’s important to know how it differs from another form of irony.</p>

## Greenteeth by Molly O’Neill: Review by Liz Bourke

date: 2025-06-03, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Greenteeth</strong>, Molly O’Neill (Orbit US 978-0-316-58424-1, $18.99, 281pp, tp) February 2025. Cover by Leo Nickolls</p>
<p><strong>Greenteeth </strong>is Australia-based British author Molly O’Neill’s debut novel, and one that owes an unexpectedly charming debt to T. Kingfisher and Terry Pratchett. In a small lake near the English village of Chipping Appleby, in an uncertainly historic (premodern, post-Reformation) century, lives the monster Jenny Greenteeth. Jenny’s a sharp-toothed predator.

<p>Every great romantic comedy has a moment where two characters collide, clash, or connect for the first time. That moment is a meet-cute – the heartbeat of any romantic comedy.&nbsp;<br><br>Meet-cutes set the tone, stakes, and emotional undercurrent for everything that follows the story. It’s where we, the audience, decide if we want to watch these characters fall in love. When done right, it can hook your viewer, define your characters, and spark a journey that feels both familiar and fresh.<br><br>Let’s break down what makes a meet-cute memorable, and how you can write one that stands out with some of our favorite examples.&nbsp;</p>
