Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0736 AM CDT Wed Apr 30 2025

Valid 301300Z - 011200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM NORTHEAST
TX INTO SOUTHWEST OK AND THE ARKLATEX...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM WEST-CENTRAL
MO ACROSS SOUTHERN IL INTO SOUTHERN IN...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible on later today into this
evening from the southern Plains into the Lower Ohio Valley, with
the greatest risk expected across north-central Texas into the
ArkLaTex region. Large to very large hail, damaging winds, and
tornadoes are all possible, with some strong-tornado potential.

...Synopsis...
Early morning satellite imagery shows a mature convective complex
over western OK and northwest TX, another decaying convective
complex over southern MO, and a shortwave trough moving across the
Southwest. Recent surface analysis shows a mesolow associated with
western OK/northwest TX MCS over the SPS vicinity, with another,
more substantial low back southwest near SNK. An outflow boundary
from prior convection extends from south-central OK through
southeastern OK before becoming more diffuse and merging with the
stationary front over central AR.

The ongoing MCS is forecast to continue eastward/northeastward
throughout the day while the Southwest shortwave progresses into the
southern High Plains. Farther east, the stationary front that
extends from AR into the Mid-Atlantic is expected to begin
translating back northward as a warm front. 

...North TX/Southern OK into the Arklatex and Mid-South...
The well-organized MCS currently tracking across southwest OK and
northwest TX is forecast to continue east-northeastward throughout
much of the period. The northern portion of this system will likely
remain progressive, moving through southern OK and north TX.
Damaging gusts and occasional hail will be possible with this system
throughout much of its lifecycle. Buoyancy decreases with eastern
extent, so the system should begin to lose intensity, but its
organized character limits the predictability of where that will
occur. Not only that, but downstream destabilization could lead to
potential reintensification/redevelopment along the outflow during
the late afternoon. Vertical shear will be modest, suggesting
reorganization into a severe convective line appears unlikely. 

The southwestern portion of this MCS is expected to trail behind the
more forward-progression portion as it becomes more parallel to the
deep-layer shear vector. This orientation would likely keep deep
convection out of central/northeast TX before this afternoon. Storm
development appears probable across central TX as the surface low
and associated dryline shifts eastward ahead of the Southwest
shortwave trough. Development is possible ahead of this dryline
within the destabilized warm sector over northeast TX as well. Lapse
rates will be modest, but ample low-level moisture will still result
in moderate to strong buoyancy during the afternoon. Additionally, a
belt of stronger low-level flow is anticipated to persist,
supporting strong low-level shear and veering low-level hodographs.
The conditions support the potential for supercells capable of all
severe hazards, including tornadoes.

Eventual storm clustering could lead to development of a nocturnal
MCS that could eventually approach parts of the lower MS Valley,
with at least an isolated severe threat.  

...West TX into Northwest TX/Southwest OK...
Additional strong to severe storms will be possible across parts of
west TX, in closer proximity to shortwave trough moving across the
southern High Plains. Cold temperatures aloft and steep lapse rates
will support a threat of hail and localized severe gusts, even
though deep-layer flow/shear will be more modest within this regime.
These storms may eventually spread toward southwest OK/northwest TX
before weakening. 

...Parts of MS/OH Valleys...
Afternoon thunderstorm development is anticipated amid modest
low-level moisture advection in the wake of the convective cluster
currently moving through southwest MO. Modest buoyancy and shear
across the region suggest there is some potential for at least
transient storm organization in the vicinity of the frontal zone,
with an attendant threat for hail, locally damaging wind, and
possibly a tornado.

...Southern VA/northern NC...
Scattered storm development will be possible near the front across
parts of VA/NC. Deep-layer flow/shear will generally be weak, but
steep low-level lapse rates could support locally damaging outflow
winds with the strongest storms.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 196
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1255 AM CDT Wed Apr 30 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southwest and South-Central Oklahoma
  Northwest and North-Central Texas

* Effective this Wednesday morning from 1255 AM until 800 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter likely
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Strong to severe thunderstorms are expected to persist
throughout the night in the vicinity of an outflow boundary that
extends across the region. Hail will be the primary risk with this
more cellular development. There is also some potential for the
storms in west TX to evolve into an organized line segment that
could progress across the region later. Damaging gusts would be the
primary risk with this more linear activity.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 50
statute miles north and south of a line from 50 miles south
southwest of Altus OK to 30 miles south southeast of Mcalester OK.
For a complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch
outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 194...WW 195...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
24035.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0303 AM CDT Wed Apr 30 2025

Valid 031200Z - 081200Z

...DISCUSSION...
A cold front will shift southward across the southern US at the
start of the extended period, scouring out much of the moisture
across the CONUS. An upper level ridge is expected to strengthen
across the central US while weak troughing continues in the
northeast. This pattern will limit severe potential across the CONUS
through the weekend.

As a surface high across the Plains strengthens and shifts eastward
into the Midwest, return flow from the Gulf will bring moisture back
in across the central and southern Plains starting D6/Monday. A
trough will strengthen across the western US D5/Sunday before
ejecting into the Plains sometime D7/Tuesday into D8/Wednesday. This
would likely bring a return to chances for severe storms across some
portion of the southern and central Plains. There is uncertainty in
how far northward moisture return will reach and where exactly
surface features will be during this time period. This precludes the
need to include areas at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 0608
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0355 PM CDT Tue Apr 29 2025

Areas affected...Portions of South Plains into western North Texas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 190...

Valid 292055Z - 292230Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 190
continues.

SUMMARY...A localized corridor of tornado potential may develop over
the next few hours. Storms will need to root along/east of the
surface boundary for this potential to be realized.

DISCUSSION...A cluster of supercells, some of which have produced
greater than 2 inch hail, are generally rooted just on the cool side
of the surface cold front. If storms can remain discrete and track
with a more eastward motion, warm/moist easterly surface winds are
in the warm sector. Greater tornado potential would exist should
that scenario occur. Given at least a modest increase in low-level
flow this evening, it is possible the boundary moves slightly
northwestward. Trends will be monitored.

Mesoscale Discussion 0607
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0335 PM CDT Tue Apr 29 2025

Areas affected...Parts of eastern Oklahoma into Northwest Arkansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 292035Z - 292230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Storms that are currently elevated may produce marginally
severe hail. A watch is not anticipated in the short term, but
trends will be monitored.

DISCUSSION...Storms in central Oklahoma have remained elevated and
sub-severe so far. The observed 18Z Norman sounding showed modestly
steep mid-level lapse rates, but relatively weak buoyancy due to
cloud cover/precipitation. This activity will generally move to the
east/northeast behind an outflow boundary. Recent surface
observations have shown some airmass modification/recovery in
east-central Oklahoma where temperatures have warmed back into the
low 70s. There is at least low potential that storms nearest to the
outflow boundary could become near to surface based. A locally
greater severe threat would be possible in that scenario. Overall,
however, storms will primarily be capable of marginally severe hail
and perhaps isolated damaging gusts.

Mesoscale Discussion 0606
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0327 PM CDT Tue Apr 29 2025

Areas affected...southern IL/IN into southwest OH.

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 188...189...

Valid 292027Z - 292230Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 188, 189
continues.

SUMMARY...Strong to severe thunderstorms producing damaging wind
gusts will move from southern Illinois into southern Indiana the
next 1-2 hours. Additional severe risk may redevelop into southwest
Ohio this evening.

DISCUSSION...A mature MCS continues to move from southern IL into
southern IN this afternoon. This activity has sporadically produced
damaging gusts and isolated hail over the last couple of hours, with
a couple areas of line-embedded rotation also noted. These storms
should maintain intensity as it moves east across a moderately
unstable airmass with steepening low-level lapse rates continuing to
support damaging wind potential across Severe Thunderstorm Watch
189. 

By evening, this MCS is expected to approach southwest OH and Severe
Thunderstorm Watch 188. The airmass across this area has shown signs
of recovery from a midday cluster of severe storms now approaching
western PA. Temperatures have rebounded into the mid/upper 70s with
dewpoints in the mid/upper 60s. This area could support a continued
severe risk into this evening. As such, watch clearance has not been
recommended as redevelopment of new convection is possible.
Likewise, the cluster moving into southern IN also may approach this
area in the next 2-3 hours.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
Issued by 15th OWS Scott Air Force Base IL
0245 PM CDT Tue Apr 29 2025

Valid 292000Z - 301200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PARTS OF
WEST TX INTO SOUTHWEST OK... AND FROM THE OHIO VALLEY INTO THE LOWER
GREAT LAKES...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible within a broad swath
from the Lower Great Lakes to the southern High Plains, mainly
during this afternoon to evening. Corridors of greater threat are
expected over the Upper Ohio Valley/Lower Great Lakes and in parts
of west Texas into southwest Oklahoma.

...Synopsis...
Satellite imagery shows a well-defined shortwave trough moving
through central Ontario and the adjacent Upper Midwest, and a mature
cyclone centered over the central UT/AZ border. The northern
shortwave trough is forecast to move eastward across the Great Lakes
and eastern Canada today while also transitioning to a more negative
tilt. The UT/AZ cyclone is expected to progress southeastward across
AZ and into western NM as an embedded shortwave trough moves through
its base across northern Mexico and into the southern High Plains.

Surface analysis places a low over Ontario, with a cold front
extending southwestward from this low into central OK where another,
weaker surface low exists. The front continues westward from this
second low across the TX Panhandle and through central NM. The
northern low is forecast to progress eastward across eastern Canada,
moving just ahead of its parent shortwave trough, ending the period
over the Canadian Maritimes. The associated cold front will also
push eastward moving through the OH and TN Valleys, and much of the
Northeast. Southern/western portion of the front will make limited
southerly/southeasterly progress, with its position becoming more
regulated by repeated convective outflow throughout the day.

Numerous thunderstorms, some severe, are occurring along the
eastward progressing cold front in OH, as well as farther southwest
across the southern Plains near the stalled boundary.

...Ohio Valley into the Lower Great Lakes...
Ongoing clusters of thunderstorms across IL extend through OH. 

Strong low/midlevel flow will support development of organized storm
clusters, along with some potential for discrete or embedded
supercells. Scattered damaging winds will be possible, with some
potential for swaths of more concentrated wind damage if any
organized linear segments develop. The strongest low-level flow will
be displaced north of the region, but 35-50 kt in the 850-700 mb
layer will support sufficient low-level shear for some supercell
and/or line-embedded tornado threat. Isolated hail could also
accompany any persistent supercell structures.

...West TX into the Ozarks...

Current satellite and radar show convection from OK through the
Ozarks. Model guidance suggest this activity will continue to
evolve, tracking northeastward.

Another round of thunderstorms is occurring both along the
outflow-modulated cold front in OK and northwest TX and along the
dryline in West TX as the air mass has destabilized. Strong buoyancy
and shear will support supercells, particularly from west TX into
southwest OK during the late afternoon where low-level convergence
will be strongest. Large to very large hail will be the primary
threat initially, but strong cold pools and close storm proximity
should result in several clusters capable of strong to significant
gusts. A mesoscale corridor of greater tornado potential may
materialize just east of the surface low where stronger
southeasterly low-level flow and higher low-level moisture may
overlap.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0245 PM CDT Tue Apr 29 2025

Valid 301200Z - 011200Z

...Florida...
Recent rainfall across the northern half of Florida has mitigated
fire weather concerns in the short term. However,
showers/thunderstorms and associated rainfall cores have been quite
isolated across the southern Florida Peninsula. Fuels remain quite
dry across the area with ERC values at or above the 97th percentile.
As a Bermuda High slides southward, a drier air mass will filter
into the state bringing east winds of 10-15 mph and relative
humidity dropping below 30 percent in some locations across
southwest Florida Wednesday. Elevated highlights were added to
stress this fire weather threat.

...Far Southeastern New Mexico into West Texas...
Latest model guidance consensus shows eastern extent of breezy and
dry conditions pushing as far east as the Stockton Plateau as
mid-level trough accelerates into the southern Plains Wednesday.
Extension of Elevated highlights were warranted with the higher
forecast confidence in place. Locally critical fire weather
conditions including west winds of 20 mph and relative humidity
around 10 percent are expected in some areas of West Texas although
recent rainfall and green-up should attenuate potential wildfire
spread.

..Williams.. 04/29/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0143 AM CDT Tue Apr 29 2025/

...Synopsis...
Within the base of a midlevel trough crossing the southern Rockies,
enhanced deep-layer westerly flow will overspread southern NM into
the TX Trans-Pecos. Here, boundary-layer mixing into the enhanced
flow aloft will promote breezy westerly surface winds amid 5-10
percent RH west of a dryline. This will favor elevated to locally
critical fire-weather conditions where fuels remain dry (west of
areas that have received recent measurable rainfall).

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0227 PM CDT Tue Apr 29 2025

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE LOWER
GREAT LAKES REGION SOUTHWESTWARD TO TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
Strong/locally severe thunderstorm development is expected from
central Texas into the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys northward to the
Great Lakes Thursday. Thunderstorms will pose a risk for strong to
severe winds and hail.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level vort max forecast to be moving eastward across the
Ozarks toward the Ohio Valley early Thursday will be followed by a
second trough digging southeastward across the north-central CONUS. 
As this occurs, weak low pressure initially progged to reside over
the Missouri vicinity will gradually deepen as it shifts
east-northeastward into the Midwest through the day, and then across
Lower Michigan and into Ontario overnight.  A trailing cold front is
forecast to shift gradually southeastward across the Midwest/Mid
Mississippi Valley/southern Plains through the period.

...Lower Great Lakes southwestward to Texas...
Thunderstorms are forecast to be ongoing over -- and just west of --
portions of the MRGL risk area at the start of the period, and this
initial convection complicates the forecast with respect to areas
where diurnal destabilization may be sufficient to fuel new/vigorous
convective development.  In general however, a midday/early
afternoon increase in storms is expected across the Lower Ohio and
Mid Mississippi Valley, ahead of a slowly advancing cold front, and
potentially in the vicinity of remnant outflow farther south into
the Lower Mississippi Valley area.  Modest shear is forecast across
the lower Mississippi Valley area, and westward into Texas where a
few later-afternoon storms may develop, which should limit overall
risk to locally stronger storms.  Hail/wind would be the primary
risks.

Farther north into the Midwest, stronger flow aloft is expected, but
also likely weaker instability.  While later inclusion of a SLGT
risk area may be needed across a portion of this area, at this time
uncertainty precludes that.  Generally, pre-frontal convection
developing during the afternoon may pose risk for severe-caliber
wind/hail locally.  Risk should gradually diminish during the
evening as storms nocturnally weaken.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER NORTH-CENTRAL
TEXAS... SOUTHEASTERN OKLAHOMA... WESTERN/CENTRAL ARKANSAS...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible on Wednesday, centered
on central Texas to eastern Oklahoma and western Arkansas. Large
hail, damaging wind, and a few tornadoes will be possible with
thunderstorm activity.

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough is expected to move eastward across the Southern
Plains on Wednesday, with multiple rounds of thunderstorm activity
possible across portions of Texas and Oklahoma. At the start of the
period Wednesday morning, convection should be ongoing across
western Oklahoma into northern Texas near the surface low. This
activity will continue to track eastward through the period and
intensify through the afternoon/evening, as the surface low moves
north and eastward. Additional thunderstorm development is expected
along the southern fringe near the dryline in north-central Texas.

A warm front extending across portions of Missouri, southern
Indiana, southern Illinois into northern Kentucky may be the focus
of strong to severe thunderstorm development Wednesday afternoon.

...Southern Plains into the Lower Mississippi Valley...
The aforementioned thunderstorm activity early in the period
Wednesday morning is expected to intensify through the afternoon, as
daytime heating and increasing moisture leads to destabilization
downstream in the warm sector. By the afternoon, the dryline across
central Texas will be the focus of new development as upper level
forcing overspreads the region. With multiple rounds of convection
expected across the Texas Panhandle into western Oklahoma and north
Texas in the D1 period, there is some uncertainty on where all the
mesoscale features will be as this occurs. Nonetheless, it appears
that ahead of the dryline the environment will be characterized by
steep lapse rates, modest MLCAPE, and strong deep layer shear. This
will support potential for a few supercells initially capable of
very large hail. Should the mode remain favorable, the tornado risk
will increase through the afternoon as the low-level jet strengthens
and low-level curvature of hodographs increases. A more favorable
corridor for tornadoes may exist near the Red River across
southeastern Oklahoma/northern Texas. Upscale growth will promote
potential for damaging wind, especially across eastern Oklahoma into
western Arkansas. However, shear will also support potential for
line embedded circulations.

Additional thunderstorms may re-develop further west across the
Texas Panhandle Wednesday afternoon, with potential for large hail.
At this time, it is uncertain how much recovery can happen from
multiple rounds of convection late D1 into D2 across this region.

...Lower MO/OH Valleys...
Along the warm front from southern Indiana into southern Illinois
and northern Kentucky, thunderstorm development is possible
Wednesday afternoon. Forcing remains weaker across this region, with
the shortwave back in the southern Plains. However, profiles would
be supportive of a supercell or two in this region, given the plume
of steep low to mid-level lapse rates, buoyancy, and sufficient
shear. These would be capable of hail, severe wind, and potentially
a tornado. For now, some uncertainty on coverage keeps probabilities
low.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1153 AM CDT Tue Apr 29 2025

Valid 291700Z - 301200Z

Dry return flow across the Mid-Atlantic will continue through this
afternoon ahead of a cold front expected to move through the region
tonight into Wednesday morning. Latest surface observations and
model guidance shows primary fire weather concern concentrated over
a corridor from New Jersey into Connecticut where relative humidity
as low as 25 percent combined with winds up to 20 mph will bring
Elevated fire weather conditions through this afternoon. In
addition, elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions are
still expected across southern New Mexico into far western Texas and
into the Big Bend area. Only minor trimming of Elevated highlights
was needed east of the Sacramento Mountains in southeastern New
Mexico as a post-frontal air mass mitigates fire weather concerns
today for this area.

..Williams.. 04/29/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0143 AM CDT Tue Apr 29 2025/

...Synopsis...
Ahead of a slow-moving large-scale trough over the Four Corners,
moderate-strong deep-layer south-southwesterly flow will overspread
a deeply mixed post-dryline air mass over southern NM into the
Trans-Pecos. A modest pressure gradient and enhanced winds through
the boundary layer will yield 15-20 mph sustained west-southwesterly
surface winds (with higher gusts) and 5-10 percent RH during the
afternoon. Given dry fuels, elevated to locally critical
fire-weather conditions are expected. 

Farther east, dry/breezy return flow will develop across portions of
the Mid-Atlantic states. With modestly receptive fuels across the
area, 10-15 mph southerly surface winds and around 30 percent RH
will favor elevated fire-weather conditions.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PARTS OF
WEST TX INTO SOUTHWEST OK... AND FROM THE OHIO VALLEY INTO THE LOWER
GREAT LAKES...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible within a broad swath
from the Lower Great Lakes to the southern High Plains, mainly
during this afternoon to evening. Corridors of greater threat are
expected over the Upper Ohio Valley/Lower Great Lakes and in parts
of west Texas into southwest Oklahoma.

...Synopsis...
Satellite imagery shows a well-defined shortwave trough moving
through central Ontario and the adjacent Upper Midwest, and a mature
cyclone centered over the central UT/AZ border. The northern
shortwave trough is forecast to move eastward across the Great Lakes
and eastern Canada today while also transitioning to a more negative
tilt. The UT/AZ cyclone is expected to progress southeastward across
AZ and into western NM as an embedded shortwave trough moves through
its base across northern Mexico and into the southern High Plains.

Surface analysis places a low over northern Lake Michigan, with a
cold front extending southwestward from this low into central OK
where another, weaker surface low exists. The front continues
westward from this second low across the TX Panhandle and through
central NM. The northern low is forecast to progress eastward across
eastern Canada, moving just ahead of its parent shortwave trough,
ending the period over the Canadian Maritimes. The associated cold
front will also push eastward moving through the OH and TN Valleys,
and much of the Northeast. Southern/western portion of the front
will make limited southerly/southeasterly progress, with its
position becoming more regulated by repeated convective outflow
throughout the day.

Numerous thunderstorms, some severe, are anticipated along the
eastward progressing cold front from the OH Valley into the Lower
Great Lakes and Northeast, as well as farther southwest across the
southern Plains near the stalled boundary.

...Ohio Valley into the Lower Great Lakes...
Ongoing clusters of thunderstorms across IL extend through OH. It
seems probable that this cluster will reintensify as it interacts
with the destabilizing air mass over the region.

Strong low/midlevel flow will support development of organized storm
clusters, along with some potential for discrete or embedded
supercells. Scattered damaging winds will be possible, with some
potential for swaths of more concentrated wind damage if any
organized linear segments develop. The strongest low-level flow will
be displaced north of the region, but 35-50 kt in the 850-700 mb
layer will support sufficient low-level shear for some supercell
and/or line-embedded tornado threat. Isolated hail could also
accompany any persistent supercell structures.

...West TX into the Ozarks...

Current satellite and radar show convection from OK through the
Ozarks. Model guidance suggest this activity will continue to
evolve, tracking northeastward.

Another round of thunderstorms is anticipated this afternoon both
along the outflow-modulated cold front in OK and northwest TX and
along the dryline in West TX as the air mass destabilizes. Strong
buoyancy and shear will support supercells, particularly from west
TX into southwest OK during the late afternoon where low-level
convergence will be strongest. Large to very large hail will be the
primary threat initially, but strong cold pools and close storm
proximity should result in several clusters capable of strong to
significant gusts. A mesoscale corridor of greater tornado potential
may materialize just east of the surface low where stronger
southeasterly low-level flow and higher low-level moisture may
overlap.

0552 AM CDT Tue Apr 29 2025

Areas affected...central into northeast Oklahoma...far southeast
Kansas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 186...

Valid 291052Z - 291345Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 186
continues.

SUMMARY...Locally severe gusts remain possible from central into
northeast Oklahoma.

DISCUSSION...The leading edge of a small MCS which moved out of
northwest TX and pivoted into southwest OK continues to produce
measured severe gusts, most recently in Grady County as of 1030Z.
North of this area, storms have gradually increased along the cold
front extending from southeast KS into north-central OK. This line
of storms is also beginning to produce outflow as well.

An unstable air mass remains ahead of both convective systems, and
it appears these storms will merge from central into northeast OK.
Damaging gusts will remain the most likely threat, although hail of
1.00+" is likely in the stronger storm cores.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 186
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
235 AM CDT Tue Apr 29 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Far Northwest Arkansas
  South-Central/Southeast Kansas
  Far Southwest Missouri
  Northern Oklahoma
  Far Northeast Texas Panhandle

* Effective this Tuesday morning from 235 AM until 1000 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected to develop across northwest OK
and the far northeast TX Panhandle in the vicinity of a cold front
progressing southward. This initial activity could pose a threat for
large hail. This development will likely grow upscale with an
attendant threat for damaging gusts as it moves eastward across
northern OK and south-central/southeast KS into far southwest MO and
far northwest AR. Some hail is possible within the stronger cells
across these areas as well.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 60
statute miles north and south of a line from 95 miles west southwest
of Alva OK to 20 miles east northeast of Joplin MO. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
24035.

NWS STORM PREDICTION CENTER NORMAN OK
0852 PM CDT MON APR 28 2025

...Severe thunderstorms expected over parts of the Upper Midwest
this evening and overnight...

* LOCATIONS...
  Wisconsin
  Northern Iowa
  Far Southeast Minnesota

* HAZARDS...
  Several tornadoes, a few intense
  Scattered large hail, some baseball size
  Scattered damaging winds

* SUMMARY...
  Multiple corridors of severe thunderstorms will continue this
  evening from the Upper Midwest into the central and southern
  Plains. Tornadoes, large hail, and severe gusts all remain
  possible, including some potential for strong tornadoes.

Preparedness actions...

Tornadoes at night can be particularly dangerous because they 
are usually fast-moving and difficult to see. Stay tuned to
NOAA Weather Radio, weather.gov, or other media for watches and
warnings. A tornado watch means that conditions are favorable
for tornadoes to form during the next several hours. If a tornado
warning is issued for your area, move to a place of safety,
ideally in a basement or interior room on the lowest floor of a
sturdy building.

Mesoscale Discussion 0588
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0333 PM CDT Mon Apr 28 2025

Areas affected...Edwards Plateau into western/central Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 282033Z - 282300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A tornado watch will likely be needed this afternoon as
storms are expected to develop along the dryline in the next 2-3
hours. All severe hazards will be possible. The tornado threat will
steadily increase from late afternoon into the evening.

DISCUSSION...Signs of mid-level ascent have been evident across the
southern Plains with visible satellite showing increasing amounts of
mid/high-level clouds moving in from the southwest. As a shortwave
perturbation lifts northeastward this afternoon/evening, this ascent
and additional surface heating should erode capping along/near the
dryline. A high-based storm has already formed northeast of Fort
Stockton in the last hour. Additional storms are expected to develop
later this afternoon, perhaps within the next 2-3 hours.

The environment will be quite favorable for supercells capable of
all severe hazards. Very steep mid-level lapse rates were observed
within the High Plains region on this mornings soundings. Large to
potentially giant hail will be possible along with severe winds.
Tornadoes will also be possible, particularly from southwest
Oklahoma into the Texas Rolling Plains where dewpoints have remained
in the upper 60s/low 70s F. The tornado threat will steadily
increase with time as 850 mb winds increase east of the dryline from
late afternoon into the evening. A strong tornado cannot be ruled
out within this more favorable mesoscale zone.

Mesoscale Discussion 0587
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0328 PM CDT Mon Apr 28 2025

Areas affected...far southeast NE...southwest into central
IA...northwest MO...northeast KS

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 282028Z - 282300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Widely scattered thunderstorms will pose a risk for a few
tornadoes (a couple strong), large to very large hail (up to 3 inch
diameter), and isolated damaging gusts through evening. A tornado
watch will likely be needed for portions of the discussion area from
central Iowa into northeast Kansas.

DISCUSSION...Deepening cumulus is noted along a dryline from eastern
NE/northwest IA southward into northeast KS. An 18z RAOB from OAX
indicated an EML around 700 mb, but only weak capping remained.
Additional heating into the low/mid 80s F amid mid/upper 60s F
dewpoints beneath steep midlevel lapse rates around 7.5-8.5 C/km 
immediately downstream from the surface dryline is support strong
instability with MLCAPE greater than 2000 J/kg noted in latest SPC
Mesoanalysis and the 18z OAX RAOB. In addition to this this
favorable thermodynamic environment, vertical shear is very
favorable for supercell thunderstorms, as evident in enlarged,
looping low-level hodographs becoming somewhat elongated above 2-3
km. 

Large-scale ascent will remain somewhat weaker with southward extent
into the MO Valley vicinity, and storm coverage is a bit uncertain,
especially with southward extent. Timing of convective initiation is
also uncertain, but seems most likely in the 22-00z time frame.
Regardless, any storms developing in this environment will likely
have robust updrafts and become intense, posing a risk for very
large hail, a few tornadoes and damaging gusts. A tornado watch will
likely be needed for portions of the MCD area in the next 1-2 hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 0586
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0225 PM CDT Mon Apr 28 2025

Areas affected...central/southeast MN...western WI...northern IA

Concerning...Severe potential...Tornado Watch likely 

Valid 281925Z - 282130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...95 percent

SUMMARY...Severe thunderstorm potential will increase through late
afternoon. All severe hazards, including tornadoes (some strong),
very large hail (to 3 inch diameter) and damaging gusts (to 70 mph)
are possible.

DISCUSSION...A line of convection along a surface front across
southwest MN into northwest IA will continue to shift east/northeast
this afternoon. Ahead of this convection, the downstream airmass
across central/southeast MN, northern IA and western WI continues to
moisten and destabilize. Surface dewpoints have increased into the
low to mid 60s as far north as the Minneapolis metro area, with
upper 50s to near 60 F to the north and east. Continued northward
moisture transport on a 50+ kt low level jet should continue to aid
in further destabilization over the next few hours as large-scale
ascent overspreads the region. 

Region VWP data from KMPX/KDMX/KARX already show impressive vertical
shear favorable for supercells. Enlarged, curved low-level
hodographs amid the strengthening low-level jet is aiding in 0-1 km
SRH greater than 250 m2/s2. As weak MLCIN continues to erode,
convection moving into this environment is likely to become better
organized, with an increase in storm coverage expected into northern
IA. Intense convection is expected to move across the MCD from late
this afternoon into this evening, posing an all-hazards severe risk.
A tornado watch will likely be needed in the next 1-2 hours.

Day 3 Convective Outlook CORR 1
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0317 AM CDT Mon Apr 28 2025

Valid 301200Z - 011200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PORTIONS OF
NORTH-CENTRAL TEXAS INTO SOUTHERN OKLAHOMA...

CORRECTED FOR INCORRECT DAY REFERENCE

...SUMMARY...
Widely scattered thunderstorm activity is expected from the southern
Plains to the Great Lakes on Wednesday as a mid-level trough ejects
into the southern Plains. Severe thunderstorms will be possible
across east-central Texas into central/eastern Oklahoma.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will eject across the southern Plains on Tuesday.
Surface low development is expected across western Texas on
D2-Tuesday, with a weak low tracking eastward into east-central
Texas by the D3-Wednesday period. Overnight thunderstorm activity is
expected at the beginning of the D3 period across portions of
central Oklahoma into east-central Texas. By the afternoon,
additional scattered thunderstorm development along the dryline near
the Red River on Wednesday afternoon will pose potential for severe
wind, hail, and a tornado.

...East-Central Texas into southern Oklahoma...
Scattered thunderstorm development along the dryline across central
Texas into Oklahoma on Wednesday afternoon will pose some severe
potential. Some uncertainty arises in coverage of morning convection
and cloud cover. However, it appears a corridor of favorable
instability and shear will overlap by the afternoon along and ahead
of the dryline. Shear profiles will be supportive of supercells
before clusters begin to form and attempts at upscale growth occur.
Large hail and damaging wind will be the primary risks given steep
lapse rates, though forecast soundings do show some curvature of low
level hodographs favorable for some tornado risk with early
supercell modes.

Mesoscale Discussion 0577
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0349 PM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025

Areas affected...parts of nw TX into the TX Pnhdl

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 272049Z - 272245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Probabilities for thunderstorm development appear low, but
may not be negligible late this afternoon into early evening, with
the environment conditionally supportive of supercells posing a risk
for large hail and tornadoes.  If and when it becomes more certain
that storms will form, a severe weather watch will probably be
needed.

DISCUSSION...Boundary-layer moisture characterized by lower/mid 60s
surface dew points is being maintained across the Lubbock through
Amarillo vicinities, beneath a deep warm elevated mixed-layer based
between 850-700 mb, just east of a dryline which may mix only slowly
northeastward/eastward into early evening.  This appears to be
contributing to strong potential instability (3000+ J/kg), beneath
moderate to strong southwesterly mid/upper flow (including 40-70+ kt
in the 500-300 mb layer), and an environment conditionally
supportive of intense supercells.

Perhaps due to the warm/dry air at mid-levels, and weak large-scale
forcing for ascent, convection allowing guidance, in particular,
continues to indicate generally low potential for thunderstorm
initiation through early evening.  However, at least attempts at
deepening convective development are evident to the west of the
dryline, and objective analysis indicates a possible secondary
maximum in dryline convergence developing near/north of Lubbock
toward areas west of Amarillo.   

Of particular concern, if a sustained storm does develop during the
next couple of hours, there appears potential for rapid
intensification while propagating across the dryline.  Toward
23-00Z, strengthening south-southeasterly low-level flow (in excess
of 30 kt around 850 mb) may contribute to enlarging clockwise curved
low-level hodographs increasingly supportive of potential for
tornadoes, in addition to large, potentially damaging hail.

Mesoscale Discussion 0576
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0347 PM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025

Areas affected...Western Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 272047Z - 272245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Watch issuance in western Kansas is currently unlikely.
Significant severe would be possible if storms develop.
Observational trends will be monitored.

DISCUSSION...Periodic enhancement to the cumulus field in western
Kansas has been noted in day cloud phase satellite imagery,
primarily in the vicinity of Goodland. Low 60s F dewpoints ahead of
the surface trough/modest dryline has allowed around 2500 J/kg
MLCAPE to develop. With the generally weak dryline circulation and
uncertain/subtle mid-level ascent, the development of deep
convection is far from a given. Only the more aggressive of the CAM
models suggests development later this afternoon. However, despite
this uncertainty, the environment will be conditionally favorable
for significant severe if storms can form. Supercells would be
likely given 40-45 kts of effective shear perpendicular to the
dryline. Furthermore, a strong increase in 850 mb winds after 00Z
would support a tornado threat.

Watch issuance appears unlikely at this time, but observational
trends (including observed sounding data) will be monitored over the
next few hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 0575
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0329 PM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025

Areas affected...2Nebraska Panhandle into the Sandhills and
Southwest Nebraska

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 272029Z - 272230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated to widely scattered supercell potential should
increase over the next 2-3 hours. Large/very-large hail and severe
gusts will be possible. The tornado threat will initially be low,
but will increase for storms persisting near/after sunset. Trends
will be monitored for watch issuance.

DISCUSSION...As the lee trough continues to deepen this afternoon,
clusters of cumulus clouds have begun to develop in northeast
Colorado. With time and the approach of a shortwave trough, a
surface low will become more evident in eastern Colorado. Low 60s F
dewpoints have already reached parts of northwest Kansas and should
continue north and west as low-level winds respond to the surface
cyclone.

Effective shear of around 45 kts across the trough axis will promote
discrete storm development. Steep mid-level lapse rates and
initially long, straight hodographs will promote a risk for
large/very-large hail and severe winds. As the low-level jet
increases this evening, any mature supercells ongoing will have an
increased potential to produce a tornado. Storm coverage is somewhat
uncertain, but isolated to widely scattered supercells appear
possible given at least modest mid-level ascent expected over the
next few hours.

Mesoscale Discussion 0574
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0255 PM CDT Sun Apr 27 2025

Areas affected...,parts of swrn TX

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 271955Z - 272100Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...The initiation of a couple of storms appears increasingly
likely near and northwest through north of Fort Stockton through 4-5
PM CDT.  More rapid thunderstorm intensification accompanied by
increasing potential for large hail and locally damaging wind gusts
may be initially slow, before probably increasing toward early
evening around the Midland through Big Spring vicinities.

DISCUSSION...The boundary-layer is becoming strongly heated and
deeply mixed across the Davis Mountains vicinity of southwest Texas
into the Texas South Plains.  The dryline is sharpening east through
north of Fort Stockton, where 2-hourly surface pressure falls around
2.0+ mb have been observed the past couple of hours, and low-level
convergence appears strongest.

Deepening convective development is ongoing within the deeper
mixed-boundary layer around Fort Stockton, where surface
temperature/dew point spreads are around 50 F (95/44), but forecast
soundings and HREF guidance suggests that the initiation of at least
isolated thunderstorm development is increasingly probable through
21-22Z.  It appears that this may be aided by forcing associated
with a mid-level speed maximum within southwesterly flow emanating
from the northern Mexican Plateau.

Downstream of slow moving large-scale mid-level troughing over the
southern Great Basin and Southwest, after at least some further
eastward mixing of the dryline late this afternoon, it probably will
begin to retreat northwest across the Pecos Valley vicinity toward
23-00Z.  As this occurs, convection may acquire more substantively
unstable updraft inflow (including most unstable CAPE up to
2000-3000+ J/kg), supporting increasing potential for rapid
thunderstorm intensification, in the presence of strong deep-layer
shear.  This may including a splitting supercell or two, posing a
risk for large hail and a few strong surface gusts.

Until then, though, initial thunderstorm development will probably
be more modest in strength, but could still pose some risk for
producing severe hail and wind.
