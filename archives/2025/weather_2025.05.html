Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0630 AM CST Mon Feb 03 2025

Valid 031300Z - 041200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not forecast across the contiguous United States
through tonight.

...Synopsis...
Water-vapor imagery this morning indicates a belt of high momentum
flow extending from west to east across the northern half of the
Lower 48.  Model guidance shows this flow regime amplifying as a
mid-level ridge builds over the Great Plains and a trough continues
to develop over the eastern Pacific to the west of the West Coast. 
In the low levels, a cold front will push southward across the
central Great Plains and through much of the Midwest during the
period.  A moist conveyor will extend from the eastern Pacific
northeastward through northern CA and into the northern Rockies. 
Showers are forecast within the aforementioned corridor but
thunderstorms are not expected.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0403 AM CST Mon Feb 03 2025

Valid 061200Z - 111200Z

...DISCUSSION...
A short-wave trough is progged to be moving across the Midwest/Ohio
Valley day 4 (Thursday), along with a weak surface wave moving along
a baroclinic zone separating Arctic air to the north, and a more
temperate/modifying continental airmass to the south.  Late day 4
(Friday morning), the low is forecast to undergo significant
cyclogenesis over the Canadian Maritimes, with the trailing surface
front becoming realigned in an east/west orientation from the
Carolinas to the southern Plains.  

During the day 4 period, as the cold front progresses southward
across the Mid South in the immediate wake of the weak frontal wave,
showers and isolated thunderstorms -- initially confined to the cool
side of the front -- will likely develop across the Mid South in a
weakly destabilizing warm sector.  With strong/weakly veering flow
through the lower troposphere, storms which do develop would be
fast-moving, and could intensify locally to near severe levels. 
However, current expectations are that the degree of surface-based
destabilization will be limited, and thus overall severe potential
tempered as well.  While low-probability severe risk across parts of
the Mid South may be required in later outlooks, the risk appears
too low to highlight at this time.

Day 5, the next short-wave trough is forecast to be crossing the
Rockies, and will likely begin impinging on the Plains overnight. 
This will support new frontal low development along the pre-existing
west-to-east baroclinic zone.  At this time, projections are that a
developing low may exist over the Ozarks vicinity, but with limited
CAPE expected in the evolving warm sector, severe weather potential
would appear minimal at best.

Day 6, the low is forecast to move rapidly east-northeastward across
the Ohio Valley through the day, and then on into/across New England
overnight.  As this occurs, the trailing portion of the baroclinic
zone should surge southeastward with time -- reaching a position
from the Mid-Atlantic region to the Gulf Coast States late.  Once
again, showers and a few thunderstorms will likely occur within the
warm sector, but again, limited CAPE should continue to characterize
the pre-frontal environment, tempering overall risk for severe
weather.  

The front should be continuing southward Day 7, moving off the Gulf
Coast during the period.  Limited CAPE and weaker flow with
southward extent should continue to limit any severe risk,
continuing through day 8 as the front shifts across Florida through
the end of the period.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0157 AM CST Sun Feb 02 2025

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Predominately zonal mid-level flow will persist over much of the
CONUS D2/Monday. Low-amplitude ridging within the zonal flow should
slowly build over the central Plains supporting relatively quiescent
weather. While occasional gusty surface winds are expected near a
lee trough across the High Plains, overall fire-weather conditions
appear limited.

...Southern Plains...
Occasional dry and breezy conditions will continue across the
southern Plains through Day2/Monday. A lee low and cold front over
west TX could support occasional gusts to 15 mph. Dry conditions
should also persist, though stronger southerly flow should increase
humidity gradually. Additional drying of fuels is likely with little
to no precipitation expected. This could support localized
fire-weather potential across the southern High Plains, but
widespread concerns are not expected.
