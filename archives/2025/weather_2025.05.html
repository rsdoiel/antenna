Mesoscale Discussion 0069
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0852 AM CST Thu Feb 06 2025

Areas affected...Southeast KY into far western VA

Concerning...Tornado Watch 3...

Valid 061452Z - 061615Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 3 continues.

SUMMARY...Some threat for locally damaging wind and/or a tornado may
continue into late morning.

DISCUSSION...A band of thunderstorms with a history of producing an
apparent tornado and locally damaging gusts is moving across
southeast KY toward western VA this morning. Diminishing instability
with eastward extent and a tendency for a weakening/veering
low-level jet (as the primary midlevel shortwave trough moves away)
should result in a gradual weakening trend with time as storms move
eastward. However, strong low/midlevel flow and favorable deep-layer
shear will continue to support organized convection through late
morning, with an attendant threat of locally damaging gusts and
perhaps a tornado across the remaining portion of WW 3, and also
potentially into adjacent parts of far western VA.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE
TENNESSEE VALLEY INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...

...SUMMARY...
Multiple rounds of isolated severe thunderstorms may occur across
parts of the southern Appalachians and Tennessee Valley, mainly this
morning and later in the afternoon to early evening.

...TN Valley into the Southern Appalachians...
A line of thunderstorms is ongoing this morning from western WV into
south-central KY, along a weak cold front progressing eastward
across the region. The warm sector ahead of this front is
characterized by temperatures in the low/mid 60s, dewpoints in the
low 60s, and modest buoyancy. Strong vertical shear exists across
this region as well, with mesoanalysis estimating effective bulk
shear values around 50-55 kt. Notable low-level curvature exists
over the region as well, supported by strong low-level flow (i.e.
850 mb flow over 50 kt). These environmental conditions are
supporting occasional updraft organization with the convective line,
with a resulting potential for a few brief tornadoes as well as
strong gusts and small hail. Shortwave trough responsible for the
cold front as well as the strong low-level flow will continue to
lift northeastward towards the Lower Great Lakes/northern
Appalachians this morning. Resultant weakening of the large-scale
ascent and low-level shear will likely lead to a weakening of this
convective line by the late morning.

The cold front is expected to continue gradually southward, and by
the early afternoon will likely extend from far western VA
west-southwestward across northern TN into northern AR. Another
low-amplitude shortwave trough is expected to move through the
region, contributing to another round of thunderstorms in the
vicinity of this front. Thunderstorms are possible on both sides of
the cold front, with greater storm coverage likely north of the
boundary where large-scale ascent will be strongest. Vertical shear
will be strong enough to support hail within a few of these elevated
storms. 

Potential for surface-based storms will exist south of the boundary,
with the degree of buoyancy modulated by how much heating is
realized. Current guidance suggests temperatures could reach the low
70s, which would result in MLCAPE around 1000 J/kg. Fast, nearly
unidirectional zonal flow regime will yield mid/upper-level
hodograph elongation. This should foster potential for an organized
cluster to develop by late afternoon, centered on the western/middle
TN vicinity. Localized damaging winds and marginally severe hail may
accompany this convection as it moves across TN and into far western
NC by early evening.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0156 AM CST Thu Feb 06 2025

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF EASTERN NM...

...Synopsis...
Westerly mid-level flow will continue over the CONUS D2/Friday as a
more prominent shortwave and attendant jet streak approach the
Southwest. In response to the approach of the upper trough, a lee
cyclone will intensify over the High Plains, supporting strong winds
and low humidity. The persistent dry conditions, exacerbated by
downslope winds and low humidity, will support widespread elevated
to critical fire-weather conditions.

...Southwest and Southern High Plains...
Another day of dry and windy conditions is expected across parts of
the Southwest and High Plains D2/Friday. As the mid-level jet and
shortwave cross the Rockies, enhanced lee cyclogensis will support
strong west/southwesterly winds of 20-30 mph across eastern AZ, much
of NM and parts of western TX/OK. Continued warm temperatures and
dry downslope trajectories will support afternoon RH values in the
teens to single digits. The combination of strong westerly winds,
low humidity and worsening fuels suggest widespread elevated to
critical fire-weather conditions are likely. The most likely area
for sustained critical concerns is expected across parts of the High
Plains in northeastern NM and the TX Panhandle.

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms will be possible across northern/central
California this afternoon and evening.

...Northern/Central CA...
Morning water vapor imagery shows a shortwave trough approaching the
coast of northern CA.  An associated surface cold front is also
moving southeastward into northern CA, with an increasingly large
shield of showers along/ahead of the front.  Forecast soundings show
the development of very weak CAPE later today, which could result in
a few lightning flashes within the embedded precip shield.  No
severe storms are expected.

0957 AM CST Tue Feb 04 2025

Valid 041700Z - 051200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track with no changes needed.
Latest guidance and morning observations continue to suggest that
fire weather concerns will remain confined to portions of the Desert
Southwest, but the coverage/duration of elevated conditions should
remain patchy with limited overlap with receptive fuels. See the
previous discussion for additional details.

..Moore.. 02/04/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CST Tue Feb 04 2025/

...Synopsis...
Ridging aloft is forecast to intensify over the central US, while a
deepening trough moves over much of the West. Several embedded
perturbations will cross the southern Rockies deepening a lee low
over the southern High Plains and a second low over the Great Basin.
This could support gusty winds and periods of locally elevated
fire-weather potential over parts of central NM and eastern AZ.

...Southwest...
A backdoor cold front will move south over the Plains and into
eastern NM early this morning associated with a weak lee low. The
influx of cooler air and more moisture should moderate RH over the
High Plains. To the west over the High country of central NM,
periodic gusty winds and low humidity are still expected to overlap
for several hours. Some localized fire-weather risk is possible over
central NM and eastern AZ. However, more widespread fire-weather
concerns are not currently expected given the relatively minor
overlap of sustained winds, low humidity and sporadic receptive
fuels.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0359 AM CST Tue Feb 04 2025

Valid 071200Z - 121200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Medium-range models are in reasonably good agreement through day 6
(Sunday), in terms of large-scale features.  Substantial divergence
begins thereafter, casting substantial uncertainty into the forecast
beyond the upcoming weekend.

Day 4, as an upper short-wave trough crossing the Northeast moves
into/across the Canadian Maritimes, the quasi-zonal flow pattern
over the U.S. will continue.  Weak amplification of the flow will
occur over the West with time, however, as a short-wave trough moves
across the Rockies.  As this occurs, frontal low development is
expected along the persistent west-to-east front lying from the
southern Plains to the Mid-Atlantic region.  However, with only weak
instability expected near the developing low, and eastward along the
front, convection is forecast to remain disorganized.

Day 5, the upper wave is forecast to continue eastward across the
central and northern Plains through the day, and into and across the
Great Lakes region overnight.  The associated frontal low --
initially progged to lie over the Oklahoma vicinity, will deepen as
it shifts east-northeastward with time, reaching the northeast
through the end of the period.  The trailing surface front will
sharpen and advance southeastward, extending from the Mid-Atlantic
region southwestward to coastal Texas late.  While showers and a few
thunderstorms will be associated with the frontal advance, weak
instability anticipated at this time should again hinder convective
intensity.

Day 6, as the low moves offshore and the front continues advancing
steadily southeastward, it should clear the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts
during the evening, lingering only across Florida through the end of
the period.  The continued trend of weak instability, as well as
weakening flow with southward extent, should hinder prospects for
more robust convection.
