Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0652 AM CST Wed Feb 05 2025

Valid 051300Z - 061200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM TENNESSEE
AND KENTUCKY INTO FAR SOUTHERN OHIO AND FAR SOUTHWEST WEST
VIRGINIA...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms with isolated severe potential will be possible this
afternoon and evening from Tennessee and Kentucky into far southern
Ohio and far southwest West Virginia.

...Synopsis...
Early morning satellite imagery reveals a shortwave trough entering
the central Plains, with another, more amplified shortwave trough
farther west across the Pacific Northwest. The lead shortwave is
forecast to progress eastward, reaching the Mid MS Valley by late
tonight and continuing through the OH Valley early tomorrow. Mass
response ahead of this wave will contribute to a broad area of
moisture return, with the airmass that is currently over east TX and
the Lower MS Valley advecting northeastward through the Mid South
and TN Valley throughout the day. A weak surface low will likely
develop over the Ozarks ahead of the approaching shortwave, before
then progressing quickly northeastward along the warm front and
ending the period near the OH/WV/KY border vicinity. 

...Tennessee/Kentucky...
As mentioned in the synopsis, moderate low-level moisture is
expected to advect in the TN Valley throughout the day, with most
guidance bringing low 60s dewpoints into western and south-central
KY by early Thursday. Showers and occasional thunderstorms are
possible amid the broad warm-air advection expected throughout the
warm sector. Instability will be modest, tempered by widespread
cloud cover and poor lapse rates, which is expected to limit
thunderstorm strength and duration throughout much of the period.
However, large-scale forcing for ascent will increase as the
shortwave trough approaches the region, augmenting the ongoing
warm-air advection. This increased lift is expected to result in
increased convective coverage and intensity, with more persistent
updrafts likely. Strong vertical shear will be in place (i.e. 0-6 km
bulk shear around 50 kt), supporting the potential for organization
with any more persistent updrafts. 

Primary threat will likely be hail as storms are generally expected
to stay elevated. A strong gust or two, and perhaps even a brief
tornado are possible from central KY into western/middle TN where a
few surface based storms could occur.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0203 AM CST Wed Feb 05 2025

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...Synopsis...
Continued, largely zonal, mid-level flow is expected across the
central and western US D2/Thursday. Several embedded perturbations
are forecast to move over the Rockies, enhancing lee troughing and
surface winds over the Southwest. Continued warm/dry conditions,
bolstered by increasing winds, should support several hours of
elevated to near-critical fire-weather concerns.

...Southern High Plains and Southwest...
Periods of breezy conditions are anticipated as low-amplitude upper
disturbances and strong westerly flow aloft traverse the central
Rockies. Modest lee troughing will encourage westerly downslope
winds of 15-25 mph off the central/southern Rockies over much of AZ
and NM. Continued dry and warm conditions, aided by deep mixing,
will keep humidity below 15% over much of the area. With several
days of drying, fuels will likely continue to become more receptive
to fire spread. Recent model guidance has trended windier and drier
across much of the Southwest. A few hours of locally critical
fire-weather conditions also appear possible within areas of
stronger terrain-enhanced wind gusts. However, confidence in
widespread critical conditions is relatively low, given the more
limited overlap of the stronger winds, low humidity and more
receptive fuels.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated thunderstorms will be possible across northern/central
California this afternoon and evening.

...Northern/Central CA...
Morning water vapor imagery shows a shortwave trough approaching the
coast of northern CA.  An associated surface cold front is also
moving southeastward into northern CA, with an increasingly large
shield of showers along/ahead of the front.  Forecast soundings show
the development of very weak CAPE later today, which could result in
a few lightning flashes within the embedded precip shield.  No
severe storms are expected.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0957 AM CST Tue Feb 04 2025

Valid 041700Z - 051200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track with no changes needed.
Latest guidance and morning observations continue to suggest that
fire weather concerns will remain confined to portions of the Desert
Southwest, but the coverage/duration of elevated conditions should
remain patchy with limited overlap with receptive fuels. See the
previous discussion for additional details.

..Moore.. 02/04/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CST Tue Feb 04 2025/

...Synopsis...
Ridging aloft is forecast to intensify over the central US, while a
deepening trough moves over much of the West. Several embedded
perturbations will cross the southern Rockies deepening a lee low
over the southern High Plains and a second low over the Great Basin.
This could support gusty winds and periods of locally elevated
fire-weather potential over parts of central NM and eastern AZ.

...Southwest...
A backdoor cold front will move south over the Plains and into
eastern NM early this morning associated with a weak lee low. The
influx of cooler air and more moisture should moderate RH over the
High Plains. To the west over the High country of central NM,
periodic gusty winds and low humidity are still expected to overlap
for several hours. Some localized fire-weather risk is possible over
central NM and eastern AZ. However, more widespread fire-weather
concerns are not currently expected given the relatively minor
overlap of sustained winds, low humidity and sporadic receptive
fuels.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0359 AM CST Tue Feb 04 2025

Valid 071200Z - 121200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Medium-range models are in reasonably good agreement through day 6
(Sunday), in terms of large-scale features.  Substantial divergence
begins thereafter, casting substantial uncertainty into the forecast
beyond the upcoming weekend.

Day 4, as an upper short-wave trough crossing the Northeast moves
into/across the Canadian Maritimes, the quasi-zonal flow pattern
over the U.S. will continue.  Weak amplification of the flow will
occur over the West with time, however, as a short-wave trough moves
across the Rockies.  As this occurs, frontal low development is
expected along the persistent west-to-east front lying from the
southern Plains to the Mid-Atlantic region.  However, with only weak
instability expected near the developing low, and eastward along the
front, convection is forecast to remain disorganized.

Day 5, the upper wave is forecast to continue eastward across the
central and northern Plains through the day, and into and across the
Great Lakes region overnight.  The associated frontal low --
initially progged to lie over the Oklahoma vicinity, will deepen as
it shifts east-northeastward with time, reaching the northeast
through the end of the period.  The trailing surface front will
sharpen and advance southeastward, extending from the Mid-Atlantic
region southwestward to coastal Texas late.  While showers and a few
thunderstorms will be associated with the frontal advance, weak
instability anticipated at this time should again hinder convective
intensity.

Day 6, as the low moves offshore and the front continues advancing
steadily southeastward, it should clear the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts
during the evening, lingering only across Florida through the end of
the period.  The continued trend of weak instability, as well as
weakening flow with southward extent, should hinder prospects for
more robust convection.
