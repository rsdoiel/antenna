<h2 id="why-half-life-3-speculation-is-reaching-a-fever-pitch-again">Why
Half-Life 3 speculation is reaching a fever pitch again</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>The more than two decades since Half-Life 2‘s release have been
filled with plenty of rumors and hints about Half-Life 3, ranging from
the official–ish to the thin to the downright misleading. As we head
into 2025, though, we’re approaching something close to a critical mass
of rumors and leaks suggesting that Half-Life 3 is really in the works
this time, and could be officially announced in the coming months. ↫
Kyle Orland at Ars Technica We should all be skeptical of anything
related to Half-Life 3, but there’s no denying something’s buzzing. The
one reason why I personally think a Half-Life 3 might be happening is
the imminent launch of SteamOS for generic PCs, possibly accompanied by
prebuilt SteamOS PCs and consoles and third-party Steam Decks. It makes
perfect sense for Valve to have such a launch accompanied by the release
of Half-Life 3, similar to how Hlaf-Life 2 was accompanied by the launch
of Steam. We’ll have to wait and see. It will be hard to fulfill all the
crazy expectations, though.</p>
