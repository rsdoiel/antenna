## First environmental survey of Scedosporium species in Lebanon

date: 2025-03-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundScedosporium species are filamentous fungi causing a wide spectrum of infections in healthy and debilitated individuals. Despite their clinical significance, the ecology of Scedosporium species remains understudied, particularly in the Middle East.MethodsIn this context, we conducted an environmental study to elucidate the distribution and ecological preferences of Scedosporium species in the North of Lebanon. One hundred and fifty-five soil samples were collected from different environmental areas and analyzed for several chemical parameters. Scedosporium isolates were then selected for species identification and genotyping.ResultsOverall, 39 (25.16%) were positive for Scedosporium species, with a predominance of S. apiospermum (80.56%). Soil analysis revealed associations between the fungal presence and pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic matter content. Moreover, genotyping analysis using MultiLocus Sequence Typing identified five major clusters. Interestingly, a number of Lebanese isolates formed an Asian-specific cluster (V) with one clinical Chinese isolate, whereas two clusters (II and III) showed a close association with German isolates, and clusters (I and IV) contained isolates with a global distribution.ConclusionThese findings provide new insights into the ecology of Scedosporium species, bridging a gap in our knowledge of their distribution on the Asian continent and laying the groundwork for future clinical investigations. Future international collaborations are essential to trace the origin of S. apiospermum.

## Antibacterial and antibiofilm activities of star anise-cinnamon essential oil against multidrug-resistant Salmonella Thompson

date: 2025-03-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe emergence of foodborne multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella has attracted considerable global attention. Given that food is the primary transmission route, our study focuses on Bellamya quadrata, a freshwater snail that is commonly consumed as a specialty food in Guangxi, China.MethodsEight MDR Salmonella strains were isolated from Bellamya quadrata samples collected across various markets. Previous animal experiments have confirmed their lethality in mice. We determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices of cinnamon essential oil (CEO) and star anise essential oil (SAEO) using the microdilution plate and checkerboard methods. The time-kill curve method was employed to assess the antibacterial activity of the cinnamon-star anise essential oil (SCEO) against planktonic MDR Salmonella. The alkaline phosphatase assay and fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that SCEO causes damage to bacterial cell walls and membranes. Crystal violet staining and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to observe changes in biofilms after SCEO treatment. Quantitative real-time PCR was utilized to analyze the expression of genes related to biofilm formation following SCEO treatment.ResultsThe MIC of SAEO was determined to be 25 mg/mL, whereas that of CEO was significantly lower at 0.62 mg/mL. The FIC index calculated was 0.375, which suggests a synergistic interaction between the two. When SCEO was used in combination at specific ratios, it demonstrated enhanced antibacterial and anti-biofilm capabilities compared to the individual effects of CEO or SAEO, potentially through the disruption of bacterial cell membranes and cell walls. However, in Salmonella treated with SCEO, an upregulation in the expression of biofilm-associated genes was observed, including csgA, adrA, bcsA, and csgD. This increase may be attributed to stress-induced transcriptional responses within the bacteria.DiscussionSCEO significantly impacts cell wall integrity, suggesting its crucial role in reducing biofilm formation. These findings indicate that SCEO holds potential as an alternative to traditional antibiotics and merits further scientific investigation and development.

## Targeting CD4+ T cells through gut microbiota: therapeutic potential of traditional Chinese medicine in inflammatory bowel disease

date: 2025-03-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic relapsing inflammation of the intestinal tract. Gut microbiota (GM) and CD4+T cells are important in the development of IBD. A lot of studies have shown that GM and their metabolites like short-chain fatty acids, bile acids and tryptophan can be involved in the differentiation of CD4+T cells through various mechanisms, which in turn regulate the immune homeostasis of the IBD patients. Therefore, regulating CD4+T cells through GM may be a potential therapeutic direction for the treatment of IBD. Many studies have shown that Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulas and some herbal extracts can affect CD4+T cell differentiation by regulating GM and its metabolites. In this review, we mainly focus on the role of GM and their metabolites in regulating the differentiation of CD4+T cells and their correlation with IBD. We also summarize the current research progress on the regulation of this process by TCM.
