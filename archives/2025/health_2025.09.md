## Enterobactin and salmochelin S4 inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus

date: 2025-03-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

There is increasing demand for novel antimicrobial agents to tackle the antimicrobial resistance crisis. Here we report that two Enterobacteriaceae-produced siderophores, enterobactin and salmochelin S4, inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus isolates, including methicillin-resistance S. aureus (MRSA) clinical isolates. The IC50 for different S. aureus isolates were 2-5 µM for salmochelin S4 and 5-10 µM for enterobactin. This inhibitory activity was partially repressed by adding Fe+3. These siderophores also inhibited the growth of Enterococcus strains, including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) clinical isolates, though less effectively than for S. aureus. The growth of various Gram-negative bacteria was barely affected by these siderophores. These results shed new light on the role of enterobactin and salmochelin in bacterial physiology and ecology and have potential for the development of novel strategies to combat the rapid rise of multidrug-resistant bacteria.

## Rapid detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae CARDS toxin in clinical respiratory specimens by a loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay

date: 2025-03-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

In light of the absence of rapid and precise diagnostic laboratory tests for the detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP), a prominent etiological agent implicated in a range of respiratory infections, we developed and evaluated a rapid and straightforward loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay targeting the MP community-acquired respiratory distress syndrome toxin (CARDS TX) gene. The LAMP assay was performed at 65°C for a duration of 60 min, yielding a minimum detection concentration of MP CARDS TX at 0.4986 pg/μl. The assay exhibited no cross-reactivity with 13 other prevalent pathogens associated with respiratory infections or with other common bacterial toxin genes. To further substantiate the validity of the LAMP assay, 200 pharyngeal swabs or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were collected from inpatients diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) between June 2021 and July 2022. The results were compared with those obtained by the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method for verification purposes. Of the 200 clinical specimens, 11 exhibited positive results for MP by LAMP and 10 displayed positive results for MP by qPCR (P = 1.000). In summary, a sensitive, specific, straightforward, and expeditious LAMP method for CARDS TX identification was developed to facilitate rapid detection of MP in point-of-care settings. This assay enables early and accurate diagnosis, even in resource-limited environments, which is important for proper antibiotic treatment and prognosis of MP infection.

## Optimized oxygen therapy improves sleep deprivation-induced cardiac dysfunction through gut microbiota

date: 2025-03-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Adequate sleep is of paramount importance for relieving stress and restoring mental vigor. However, the adverse physiological and pathological responses resulting from sleep insufficiency or sleep deprivation (SD) are becoming increasingly prevalent. Currently, the impact of sleep deficiency on gut microbiota and microbiota-associated human diseases, especially cardiac diseases, remains controversial. Here, we employed the following methods: constructed an experimental sleep-deprivation model in mice; conducted 16S rRNA sequencing to investigate the changes in gut microbiota; through fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments, transplanted fecal microbiota from sleep-deprived mice to other mice; established an environment with a 30% oxygen concentration to explore the therapeutic effects of oxygen therapy on gut microbiota-associated cardiac fibrosis and dysfunction; and utilized transcriptome data to study the underlying mechanisms of oxygen therapy. The results revealed that: sleep-deprived mice exhibited weakness, depression-like behaviors, and dysfunction in multiple organs. Pathogenic cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis occurred in sleep-deprived mice, accompanied by poor ejection fraction and fractional shortening. 16S rRNA sequencing indicated that sleep deprivation induced pathogenic effects on gut microbiota, and similar phenomena were also observed in mice that received fecal microbiota from sleep-deprived mice in the FMT experiments. The environment with a 30% oxygen concentration effectively alleviated the pathological impacts on cardiac function. Transcriptome data showed that oxygen therapy targeted several hypoxia-dependent pathways and inhibited the production of cardiac collagen. In conclusion, these results demonstrate the significance of sufficient sleep for gut microbiota and may represent a potential therapeutic strategy, where the oxygen environment exerts a protective effect on insomniacs through gut microbiota.

## Investigating the Gut Microbiota Profile in Prehypertensive Individuals Exhibiting Phlegm-Dampness Constitution

date: 2025-03-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundPrehypertension is the preclinical stage of hypertension, which is more likely to develop into hypertension than normal blood pressure. Although the body may experience pathological changes at this stage, there are often no symptoms. Chinese medicine constitution theory is widely used to assess an individual’s health and disease status, which provides a new method for disease prevention. The phlegm-dampness constitution (PDC) is the main constitution in prehypertension. Dysbiosis of the intestinal flora is considered to be related to the development of hypertension. However, the characteristics of the intestinal flora in prehypertensive populations with PDCs are still unknown.Methods16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal samples was performed in this study, which included 30 prehypertensive subjects with PDCs, 30 nonphlegm-dampness constitution (NPDC) prehypertensive individuals with balanced constitution, and 30 ideal blood pressure subjects with balanced constitution (BC). On the basis of the composition of the intestinal flora, a random forest classifier was constructed to screen the specific bacteria of the prehypertensive PDC population, and the diagnostic efficiency was determined by the area under the curve (AUC).ResultsAt the phylum level, the abundance of Bacteroidetes decreased in the PDC group compared with the NPDC group. Bacteroides was the most important genus at the genus level. Compared with those in the NPDC or BC group, the relative abundances of o_RF39, f_Porphyromonadaceae, f_Christensenellaceae, g_parabacteroides, and g_nitrobacteria in the PDC group were significantly greater. The random forest analysis results revealed that Alistipes, Butyricimonas, Odoribacter, Parabacteroides, and Corynebacterium are bacterial genera that significantly differ between the PDC and NPDC groups and greatly contribute to group differentiation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that the AUC range of differential bacteria and its combined diagnostic model ranged from 0.653 (95% CI: 0.511–0.794) to 0.706 (95% CI: 0.573–0.838), suggesting that it is a potential risk marker for phlegm-dampness constitution with prehypertension.ConclusionsOur study indicates that PDC individuals with prehypertension can be distinguished from NPDC individuals according to their gut microbiome characteristics. Prevention and treatment measures based on these biomarkers may be beneficial in opening new ideas and directions for identifying more aggressive and effective interventions for prehypertensive populations.

## Significance of the gut tract in the therapeutic mechanisms of polydopamine for acute cerebral infarction: neuro-immune interaction through the gut-brain axis

date: 2025-03-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundRecent research has made significant progress in elucidating gastrointestinal complications following acute cerebral infarction (ACI), which includes disorders in intestinal motility and dysbiosis of the gut microbiota. Nevertheless, the role of the gut (which is acknowledged as being the largest immune organ) in the immunoreactive effects of polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA) on acute ischemic stroke remains inadequately understood. In addition to its function in nutrient absorption, the gut acts as a protective barrier against microbes. Systemic immune responses, which are triggered by the disruption of gut barrier integrity, are considered as one of the mechanisms underlying acute ischemic stroke, with the gut-brain axis (GBA) playing a pivotal role in this process.MethodsIn this study, we used a PDA intervention in an ACI model to investigate ACI-like behavior, intestinal barrier function, central and peripheral inflammation, and hippocampal neuron excitability, thus aiming to elucidate the mechanisms through which PDA improves ACI via the GBA.ResultsOur findings indicated that as ACI mice experienced dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and intestinal barrier damage, the levels of proinflammatory factors in the serum and brain significantly increased. Additionally, the activation of astrocytes in the hippocampal region and neuronal apoptosis were observed in ACI mice. Importantly, our study is the first to provide evidence demonstrating that PDA effectively suppresses the neuroimmune interactions of the gut-brain axis and significantly improves intestinal epithelial barrier integrity.ConclusionWe hope that our discoveries will serve as a foundation for further explorations of the therapeutic mechanisms of PDA in ACI, particularly in elucidating the protective roles of gut microbiota and intestinal barrier function, as well as in the development of more targeted clinical interventions for ACI.

## Macrolide resistance in Mycoplasma pneumoniae in adult patients

date: 2025-03-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is one of the most significant pathogens responsible for<br>respiratory infections in humans. Macrolides are recommended as the first-line treatment for M. pneumoniae infection. The prevalence of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae has increased significantly in recent decades, particularly in China. The mechanisms of resistance in M. pneumoniae to macrolides have been extensively studied in pediatric patients. However, a paucity reports regarding the resistance characteristics and mechanisms exhibited in adults. The aim of this study was to elucidate the resistance of M. pneumoniae to macrolides and the underlying mechanisms in adult patients. Pharyngeal swab specimens were collected from adult patients presenting with subacute cough or community-acquired pneumonia at our hospital from January 2011 to June 2017 to identify and isolate M. pneumoniae strains. The antimicrobial susceptibility of these isolates to 3 macrolide antibiotics was assessed using broth microdilution method. The 23S rRNA genes of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae strains were sequenced, and the presence of target methylation genes (ermA, ermB, and ermC), efflux pump genes (mefA, mefA/E, msrA, and msrA/B), and the macrolide resistance gene mphC was identified through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Additionally, MICs were determined with and without the efflux pump inhibitor reserpine. A total of 72 M. pneumoniae strains were isolated from adult patients, with 41.7% (30/72) exhibiting macrolide resistance. Among the 3 macrolides tested, the 16-membered-ring midecamycin exhibited the greatest activity (MIC90: 16 µg/ml) against M. pneumoniae. All macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae strains harbored mutations at the 2063 site in domain V of the 23S rRNA gene. Two macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae clinical isolates were found to harbor the efflux pump genes msrA/B and mefA. The efflux pump inhibitor reserpine reduced the MIC for azithromycin in these two strains to a quarter of their original values. In summary, macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae is commonly observed among adults in Beijing. Point mutations are the primary mechanism responsible for macrolide resistance in adults with M. pneumoniae. Additionally, the efflux pump mechanism may contribute partially to this resistance. Midecamycin presents a promising alternative drug for treating M. pneumoniae infections, particularly in cases of azithromycin-resistant M. pneumoniae infection in young children.

## First environmental survey of Scedosporium species in Lebanon

date: 2025-03-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundScedosporium species are filamentous fungi causing a wide spectrum of infections in healthy and debilitated individuals. Despite their clinical significance, the ecology of Scedosporium species remains understudied, particularly in the Middle East.MethodsIn this context, we conducted an environmental study to elucidate the distribution and ecological preferences of Scedosporium species in the North of Lebanon. One hundred and fifty-five soil samples were collected from different environmental areas and analyzed for several chemical parameters. Scedosporium isolates were then selected for species identification and genotyping.ResultsOverall, 39 (25.16%) were positive for Scedosporium species, with a predominance of S. apiospermum (80.56%). Soil analysis revealed associations between the fungal presence and pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic matter content. Moreover, genotyping analysis using MultiLocus Sequence Typing identified five major clusters. Interestingly, a number of Lebanese isolates formed an Asian-specific cluster (V) with one clinical Chinese isolate, whereas two clusters (II and III) showed a close association with German isolates, and clusters (I and IV) contained isolates with a global distribution.ConclusionThese findings provide new insights into the ecology of Scedosporium species, bridging a gap in our knowledge of their distribution on the Asian continent and laying the groundwork for future clinical investigations. Future international collaborations are essential to trace the origin of S. apiospermum.

## Antibacterial and antibiofilm activities of star anise-cinnamon essential oil against multidrug-resistant Salmonella Thompson

date: 2025-03-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe emergence of foodborne multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella has attracted considerable global attention. Given that food is the primary transmission route, our study focuses on Bellamya quadrata, a freshwater snail that is commonly consumed as a specialty food in Guangxi, China.MethodsEight MDR Salmonella strains were isolated from Bellamya quadrata samples collected across various markets. Previous animal experiments have confirmed their lethality in mice. We determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices of cinnamon essential oil (CEO) and star anise essential oil (SAEO) using the microdilution plate and checkerboard methods. The time-kill curve method was employed to assess the antibacterial activity of the cinnamon-star anise essential oil (SCEO) against planktonic MDR Salmonella. The alkaline phosphatase assay and fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that SCEO causes damage to bacterial cell walls and membranes. Crystal violet staining and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to observe changes in biofilms after SCEO treatment. Quantitative real-time PCR was utilized to analyze the expression of genes related to biofilm formation following SCEO treatment.ResultsThe MIC of SAEO was determined to be 25 mg/mL, whereas that of CEO was significantly lower at 0.62 mg/mL. The FIC index calculated was 0.375, which suggests a synergistic interaction between the two. When SCEO was used in combination at specific ratios, it demonstrated enhanced antibacterial and anti-biofilm capabilities compared to the individual effects of CEO or SAEO, potentially through the disruption of bacterial cell membranes and cell walls. However, in Salmonella treated with SCEO, an upregulation in the expression of biofilm-associated genes was observed, including csgA, adrA, bcsA, and csgD. This increase may be attributed to stress-induced transcriptional responses within the bacteria.DiscussionSCEO significantly impacts cell wall integrity, suggesting its crucial role in reducing biofilm formation. These findings indicate that SCEO holds potential as an alternative to traditional antibiotics and merits further scientific investigation and development.

## Targeting CD4+ T cells through gut microbiota: therapeutic potential of traditional Chinese medicine in inflammatory bowel disease

date: 2025-03-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic relapsing inflammation of the intestinal tract. Gut microbiota (GM) and CD4+T cells are important in the development of IBD. A lot of studies have shown that GM and their metabolites like short-chain fatty acids, bile acids and tryptophan can be involved in the differentiation of CD4+T cells through various mechanisms, which in turn regulate the immune homeostasis of the IBD patients. Therefore, regulating CD4+T cells through GM may be a potential therapeutic direction for the treatment of IBD. Many studies have shown that Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulas and some herbal extracts can affect CD4+T cell differentiation by regulating GM and its metabolites. In this review, we mainly focus on the role of GM and their metabolites in regulating the differentiation of CD4+T cells and their correlation with IBD. We also summarize the current research progress on the regulation of this process by TCM.
