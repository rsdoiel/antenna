## Unraveling the role of the gut microbiome in pregnancy disorders: insights and implications

date: 2025-03-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The gut microbiota is the collective term for the microorganisms that reside in the human gut. In recent years, advances in sequencing technology and bioinformatics gradually revealed the role of gut microbiota in human health. Dramatic changes in the gut microbiota occur during pregnancy due to hormonal and dietary changes, and these changes have been associated with certain gestational diseases such as preeclampsia (PE) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Modulation of gut microbiota has also been proposed as a potential treatment for these gestational diseases. The present article aims to review current reports on the association between gut microbiota and gestational diseases, explore possible mechanisms, and discuss the potential of probiotics in gestational diseases. Uncovering the link between gut microbiota and gestational diseases could lead to a new therapeutic approach.

## Analysis between Helicobacter pylori infection and hepatobiliary diseases

date: 2025-03-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectiveHelicobacter pylori (H. pylori) represents a significant chronic health concern, affecting approximately half of the global population. While H. pylori infection has been closely linked to numerous extradigestive diseases, the relationship between H. pylori and lesions in the gallbladder and biliary tract remains under debate.MethodWe retrospectively collected data from patients who underwent H. pylori tests at the Physical Examination Center of Taizhou Central Hospital (Taizhou University Hospital) between 2018 and 2022. Logistic regression analysis and restricted cubic spline analysis were employed to investigate the correlation between parameters and H. pylori. Additionally, we utilized population data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database as an external validation cohort.ResultsA total of 30,612 patients were included in the training set, with 22,296 (72.8%) belonging to the H. pylori non-infection group and 8,316 (27.2%) to the H. pylori infection group. Compared to the non-infection group, patients in the infection group exhibited a significant decrease in albumin levels and a notable increase in total cholesterol and erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels. Furthermore, the infection group demonstrated significantly higher occurrences of gallbladder cholesterol crystals (6.0%), gallbladder polyps (20.2%), and atherosclerosis (25.6%) compared to the non-infection group, with respective rates of 5.1%, 19.1%, and 21.4% (average p < 0.05). However, no significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of fatty liver, intrahepatic inflammation, gallstones, or cholecystitis. Additional regression analysis revealed that H. pylori, age, BMI, albumin, and total cholesterol were independent risk factors for the cholesterol crystals and atherosclerosis.ConclusionH. pylori infection is closely associated with the gallbladder cholesterol crystals and atherosclerosis, albeit not with conditions such as fatty liver, gallbladder stones, or cholecystitis. Future research necessitates multi-center, prospective studies to corroborate these findings.

## Diabetes exacerbates SARS-CoV-2 replication through ineffective pulmonary interferon responses, delayed cell-mediated immunity, and disruption of leptin signaling

date: 2025-03-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Comorbidities, including obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), are associated with increased disease severity and mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we investigated virus-host interactions under the effects of these comorbidities in diet-induced obesity (DIO) and leptin receptor-deficient (T2DM) mice following infection with SARS-CoV-2. DIO mice, as well as their lean counterparts, showed limited susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, T2DM mice showed exacerbated pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 replication and delayed viral clearance associated with down-regulation of innate and adaptative immune gene signatures, ineffective type I interferon response, and delayed SARS-CoV-2-specific cell-mediated immune responses. While T2DM mice showed higher and prolonged SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin isotype responses compared to their lean counterparts, neutralizing antibody levels were equivalent. By silencing the leptin receptor in vitro using a human alveolar epithelial cell line, we observed an increase in SARS-CoV-2 replication and type I interferons. Altogether, our data provides for the first time evidence that disruption of leptin receptor signaling leading to obesity and T2DM induces altered type I interferon and cell-mediated responses against SARS-CoV-2, mediating increased viral replication and delayed clearance. These data shed light on the alteration of the innate immune pathway in the lung using in-depth transcriptomic analysis and on adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 under T2DM conditions. Finally, this study provides further insight into this risk factor aggravating SARS-CoV-2 infection and understanding the underlying cellular mechanisms that could help identify potential intervention points for this at-risk population.

## Prevalence of enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis in patients with colorectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis

date: 2025-03-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe gut microbiome, specifically enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF), has been reported to play a role in colorectal cancer development. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies to compare the prevalence of ETBF in patients with colorectal cancer and healthy controls as well as in various stages of colorectal cancer.MethodsPubMed, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library were systematically searched for studies published until May 2024. We utilized studies either comparing the prevalence of ETBF in patients with colorectal cancer and healthy control or examining its prevalence across different stages of colorectal cancer. The prevalence of ETBF colonization in biological samples from individuals with colorectal cancer compared to that in healthy controls or adjacent normal tissue as well as the association between the prevalence of ETBF and various stages of colorectal cancer were plotted using a random-effect or fixed-effect model.ResultsFourteen relevant articles were identified. Meta-analyses revealed that patients with colorectal cancer had a higher likelihood of having ETBF than healthy controls (odds ratio [OR]: 2.54, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.63–3.98, I2 = 55%). Additionally, ETBF detection was lower in stage I/II than in stage III/IV colorectal cancer (OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.41–0.91, I2 = 41%).DiscussionThe prevalence of ETBF was consistently higher in the tissue and fecal samples of patients with colorectal cancer than in those of controls. A difference in ETBF prevalence between stage I/II and stage III/IV colorectal cancer was noted, but further analysis revealed that the conclusion is unreliable.Systematic review registrationhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier CRD 42024548325.

## Synergistic effects of Candida albicans and Porphyromonas gingivalis biofilms on epithelial barrier function in a 3D aspiration pneumonia model

date: 2025-03-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionPolymicrobial infections involving Candida albicans and Porphyromonas gingivalis represent a significant challenge in maintaining epithelial barrier integrity. This study explores their synergistic effects on epithelial cells using an air-liquid interface (ALI) model.MethodsMixed-species biofilms were developed and analyzed for their impact on epithelial permeability and tight junction proteins. The effects of biofilm supernatants on IL-8 secretion and oxidative stress markers were also evaluated. The role of P. gingivalis proteases was assessed using a gingipain-null mutant (ΔKΔRAB) compared to the wild-type strain (W83). Survival experiments were conducted using Galleria mellonella larvae to examine the pathogenicity of dual-species biofilms.ResultsMixed-species biofilms significantly increased epithelial permeability and disrupted tight junction proteins, as evidenced by reduced levels of ZO-1 and E-cadherin. These changes were accompanied by oxidative stress, characterized by decreased HO-1 expression and enhanced Bax/Bcl-xL ratios, indicating increased pro-apoptotic activity. Supernatants from dual-species biofilms demonstrated a pronounced effect on epithelial cells, modulating IL-8 secretion and exacerbating oxidative damage. C. albicans was identified as the dominant driver of pro-inflammatory responses, while P. gingivalis contributed through immune modulation and enzymatic activity, primarily via gingipains. The ΔKΔRAB mutant biofilms caused less epithelial disruption and oxidative stress compared to the wild-type, highlighting the critical role of gingipains in pathogenesis.DiscussionSurvival experiments using Galleria mellonella larvae supported these findings, highlighting the reduced survival associated with dual-species biofilms and the potential for high-dose antimicrobial therapies to mitigate this effect. These results emphasize the cooperative mechanisms of C. albicans and P. gingivalis in compromising epithelial barriers and underline the importance of combination therapies targeting both fungal and bacterial components in polymicrobial infections.

## Microbiological and clinical predictors of sepsis-associated encephalopathy in bloodstream infections: a retrospective cohort study

date: 2025-03-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundSepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a common and severe complication of sepsis, significantly contributing to morbidity and mortality. The impact of specific blood-borne pathogens on SAE risk and prognosis remains unclear. This study investigates the microbiological and clinical factors associated with bloodstream infection-induced SAE.MethodsWe analyzed data from the MIMIC-IV database, including 16,141 sepsis patients who met inclusion criteria. Patients were divided into SAE and non-SAE groups for comparison. Multivariate regression identified independent risk factors for SAE and associated outcomes, including in-hospital mortality.ResultsCoagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) was identified as a key microbial risk factor for SAE (HR=1.919, P<0.001), though it was not associated with in-hospital mortality. Higher SOFA scores, mechanical ventilation, and prolonged antibiotic use significantly increased SAE risk. Laboratory tests revealed higher white blood cell counts, platelet levels, and metabolic abnormalities in SAE patients. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was linked to increased mortality in SAE patients (HR=3.423, P<0.001).ConclusionCoagulase-negative staphylococci is a significant risk factor for SAE development, but not for mortality. Advanced age, female gender, higher SOFA scores, and mechanical ventilation further contribute to SAE risk. Early identification and targeted management of pathogens, particularly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, are crucial for improving SAE outcomes.

## Decoy receptor 3 as a prognostic biomarker for sepsis and septic shock according to the Sepsis-3 definitions

date: 2025-03-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectivesThe present study was conducted to reappraise the prognostic value of decoy receptor 3 (DcR3) for patients with sepsis and septic shock according to the latest Sepsis-3 definitions.MethodsSubjects suffering from sepsis or septic shock were enrolled within 6 h of admission. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and the plasma levels of DcR3, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and interleukin-6 were measured. Group comparisons were made based on the survival status on day 28 after onset. Predictors of mortality were assessed using the Cox proportional hazard models, and survival curves were plotted with the Kaplan–Meier method. Discriminative performances of single and combined indicators were evaluated via the areas under receiver operating characteristic curves.ResultsAmong 143 eligible sepsis cases, 77 developed septic shock, and the 28-day mortality rates were 32.2% and 45.5%, respectively. Regardless of the population (all sepsis or septic shock), non-survivors exhibited significantly higher DcR3 levels compared to survivors (median 4.19 vs. 2.64 ng/mL and 4.37 vs. 3.18 ng/mL, respectively; p < 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). DcR3 levels were most correlated with organ dysfunction presented by SOFA scores (correlation coefficient = 0.347 and 0.308, respectively; p = 0.001 and 0.016, respectively) but did not differ among the various pathogenic microbes of infection. Multivariate Cox regression identified DcR3 as an independent predictor of mortality [hazard ratio (95% confidence interval): 1.570 (1.048–2.352) and 1.828 (1.047–3.194), respectively; p = 0.029 and 0.034, respectively]. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that elevated DcR3 concentrations were associated with significantly lower survival rates (p = 0.001 and 0.013, respectively). The areas under receiver operating characteristic curves of DcR3 alone for predicting outcome were superior to that of the other three biomarkers (0.731 and 0.711, respectively) and could be further improved when coupled with SOFA scores (0.803 and 0.784, respectively).ConclusionsDcR3 is a valuable prognostic biomarker for sepsis and septic shock, offering the potential to predict 28-day mortality in clinical settings.

## Characterization of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in bloodstream infections: antibiotic resistance, virulence, and treatment strategies

date: 2025-03-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundCarbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) infections pose a major clinical challenge due to multidrug resistance. This study evaluated the clinical features, antibiotic resistance mechanisms, virulence factors, and the potential therapeutic impact of berberine hydrochloride (a traditional Chinese medicine) in CRKP infections.MethodsNinety-four CRKP isolates from bloodstream infections at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University were characterized for carbapenemase genes, antibiotic susceptibility, and virulence determinants. Clinical data were analyzed to identify risk factors for CRKP infection, and the in vitro antibacterial activity of berberine hydrochloride was assessed.ResultsMost of the isolates (71.3%) were from the intensive care unit (ICU) patients. The blaKPC gene was the predominant resistance mechanism (62.77%), while the virulence genes uge (93.62%) and wabG (92.55%) were highly prevalent. ICU admission, male sex, respiratory diseases, invasive procedures, prior use of third-generation cephalosporinase inhibitors, and absence of traditional Chinese medicine treatment were linked to poorer outcomes. Importantly, berberine hydrochloride inhibited CRKP growth in vitro, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 125 mg/mL.ConclusionOur study reveals the multifaceted resistance and virulence profiles of CRKP in bloodstream infections and highlights the potential clinical value of berberine hydrochloride as an adjunctive therapeutic agent. These findings support further clinical investigations into incorporating traditional Chinese medicine to improve outcomes in patients with CRKP bloodstream infections.

## Deconstruct the link between gut microbiota and neurological diseases: application of Mendelian randomization analysis

date: 2025-03-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundRecent research on the gut-brain axis has deepened our understanding of the correlation between gut bacteria and the neurological system. The inflammatory response triggered by gut microbiota may be associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, the impact of gut microbiota on emotional state, known as the “Gut-mood” relationship, could play a role in depression and anxiety disorders.ResultsThis review summarizes recent data on the role of gut-brain axis in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders including epilepsy, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, brain cancer, Parkinson’s disease, bipolar disorder and stroke. Also, we conducted a Mendelian randomization study on seven neurological disorders (Epilepsy, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, brain cancer, Parkinson’s disease, bipolar disorder and stroke). MR-Egger and MR-PRESSO tests confirmed the robustness of analysis against horizontal pleiotropy.ConclusionsBy comparing the protective and risk factors for neurological disorders found in our research and other researches, we can furtherly determine valuable indicators for disease evolution tracking and potential treatment targets. Future research should explore extensive microbiome genome-wide association study datasets using metagenomics sequencing techniques to deepen our understanding of connections and causality between neurological disorders.

## Multi-omics analysis reveals that low cathepsin S expression aggravates sepsis progression and worse prognosis via inducing monocyte polarization

date: 2025-03-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundMonocytes represent a vital cellular subpopulation in the peripheral blood, crucial in the progression of sepsis. Nonetheless, the prognostic role and precise function of monocytes in sepsis are still inadequately understood.MethodsSingle-cell transcriptomic sequencing and bioinformatics analysis were performed on peripheral blood samples from septic patients to identify key molecules in cell subsets. Subsequently, the expression pattern of this molecule was validated through diverse biological experiments, encompassing quantitative RT-PCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence. Finally, the functionality of this molecule was evaluated using its specific agonist.ResultsA total of 22 monocytes-related biomarkers were identified from single-cell and bulk RNA-seq analyses. Initially, LASSO analysis was performed to derive a prognostic signature composed of 4 key genes, including CD14, CTSS, CXCL8 and THBS1. Subsequently, mendelian randomization and survival analysis demonstrated that only CTSS showed crucially protective role in sepsis development and prognosis. Next, CTSS was confirmed to be lower expressed in peripheral monocytes of septic patients. Inflammatory markers (p < 0.05) and migration ability of LPS-activated monocytes were significantly reduced after CTSS agonist. In addition, CTSS agonist decreased the pulmonary tissue monocyte/macrophages infiltration in septic mice.ConclusionMonocyte marker CTSS represent a promising target for the diagnosis and prognosis evaluation of sepsis and plays a critical role in monocytes activation, tissue inflammatory response and macrophages infiltration. Thus, CTSS agonist probably serves as new drug for clinical protection against sepsis.

## Massa Medicata Fermentata treated spleen deficiency constipation by mediating intestinal microbiota and serum peptide

date: 2025-03-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

ObjectivesTo investigate the correlation between the treatment of spleen deficiency constipation and the typical brain and intestinal peptides.MethodsA total of 18 male Kunming mice were randomly divided into three treatment groups (n = 6): normal group (CC), model group (CM), and Massa Medicata Fermentata intervention group (CG). CM and CG were used to establish a spleen deficiency constipation mouse model. After the model was finished, CG was infused with 0.15 g/mL Massa Medicata Fermentata water infusion at a dose of 4 g/(kg·day), twice a day, at 0.4 mL. An equal amount of distilled water was infused in CC and CM for 7 days. The body weight and fecal water content of the mice were monitored during the modeling. Following the intervention, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was used to analyze changes in the microflora in the intestinal contents, and serum substance P (SP), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) levels were determined via ELISA.ResultsThe modeling had no significant effect on the weight of the mice, the water content of the mice’s feces was greatly reduced, and the feces were dry and hard. Constipation caused by spleen deficiency can lead to a decrease in serum SP and an increase in VIP and CGRP. After treatment with Massa Medicata Fermentata, SP, VIP, and CGRP all changed. Intestinal microbiota diversity of mice with spleen deficiency constipation, and the dominant microbiota and characteristic microbiota changed, indicating that the intestinal microbiota was unbalanced. After the intervention of Massa Medicata Fermentata, the intestinal microbiota diversity of spleen deficiency constipation mice increased; the dominant microbiota became Candidatus Arthromitus, Lactobacillus, unclassified Bacilli, Bacillus, Ligilactobacillus, Muribaculaceae, Bacteroides, and Enterorhabdus; and the characteristic microbiota became Candidatus Arthromitus. Through the analysis of characteristic microbiota and serum SP, VIP, and CGRP levels, Ligilactobacillus was found to be positively correlated with SP and negatively correlated with VIP, Akkermansia and Streptococcus were negatively correlated with SP, Candidatus Arthromitus was negatively correlated with CGRP, Akkermansia and Candidatus Arthromitus were negatively correlated with VIP, and Candidatus Arthromitus was negatively correlated with CGRP.ConclusionsMassa Medicata Fermentata can affect the secretion of short-chain fatty acids in the intestine by altering the microecological environment of the intestine, then affect the secretion of serum peptides in mice, and alleviate the spleen deficiency constipation.

## Clinical characteristics, molecular epidemiology and mechanisms of colistin heteroresistance in Enterobacter cloacae complex

date: 2025-03-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionColistin has emerged as the last resort for treating multidrug-resistant Enterobacter cloacae complex (ECC) infections. The primary purposes of this study were to demonstrate the presence of colistin heteroresistance in ECC and to further investigate their clinical characteristics, molecular epidemiology and mechanisms.MethodsPopulation analysis profiles (PAP) were performed to confirm the heteroresistance phenotype. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) was determined to classify ECC species. Phylogenetic analysis based on core genome single nucleotide polymorphisms (cg-SNPs), multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and core genome MLST (cg-MLST). Risk factors and clinical outcomes of infections were analyzed through a retrospective case-control study. Potential mechanisms of colistin heteroresistance were evaluated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), efflux pump inhibition assays and reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).ResultsA high proportion (24.4%) of the non-resistant strains were colistin-heteroresistant isolates. Among the several ECC species, Enterobacter kobei had the largest percentage (29.4%) of colistin-heteroresistant isolates, followed by Enterobacter hormaechei (20.5%) and Enterobacter bugandensis (20.0%). Notably, only one strain (0.8%; 1/132) of Enterobacter hormaechei was fully resistant to colistin. Different ECC species showed varying heteroresistance levels: Enterobacter roggenkampii, Enterobacter kobei, Enterobacter asburiae and Enterobacter bugandensis displayed high heteroresistance levels  (MIC ≥ 128 mg/L). 75% of all ST116 and ST56 strains were heteroresistant to colistin. The infection of ST116 and ST56 strains as well as exposure to cephalosporin antibiotics were independent risk factors for colistin-heteroresistant ECC infections. Mechanistic analysis revealed that heteroresistance strongly correlated with the overexpression of arnA, regulated by the PhoPQ two-component system (TCS). Notably, mgrB had minimal impact. AcrAB-TolC efflux pump genes showed unsynchronized expression; High acrB expression was strongly associated with colistin heteroresistance, while acrA and tolC were not.DiscussionColistin heteroresistance showed species-dependent variations in levels and prevalence rates. The colistin-heteroresistant mechanisms were complex, involving coordinated regulation of multiple genes. These results highlighted the need for tailored antimicrobial stewardship. In addition, the development of direct, reliable and rapid clinical methods for detecting heteroresistance is essential for improving infection management and prevention.

## Identification and phylogenetic characterization of novel hunnivirus recombinant strains in cattle from Guangxi, China

date: 2025-03-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionHunnivirus (HuV), a member of the Picornaviridae family, is a single-stranded RNA virus associated with gastrointestinal issues in animals and poses potential zoonotic risks. While HuV has been detected in various animals, its prevalence and genetic characteristics in cattle remain poorly understood.MethodsFrom 2021 to 2023, we collected 1,017 fecal samples from cattle across Guangxi, China, and analyzed them for HuV using RT-PCR. Phylogenetic and sequence analyses were conducted to assess the virus’s genetic diversity and potential recombination events. Additionally, five HuV-positive samples were selected for whole-genome amplification and sequencing.ResultsThe overall prevalence of HuV was 3.05%, with significantly higher detection rates in diarrheic cattle (9.59%) compared to healthy cattle (2.54%). Regional prevalence varied, with the highest in Liuzhou (5.66%) and the lowest in Nanning (1.51%). Phylogenetic analysis identified a novel recombinant strain with distinct evolutionary patterns in the P3 genomic region. Sequence analysis revealed low homology in the VP1 and P1 regions compared to known genotypes, suggesting the classification of these strains as a new genotype. Additionally, the 5’ untranslated region (5’UTR) analysis confirmed the presence of type II Internal Ribosome Entry Sites (IRES), showing up to 91.8% nucleotide similarity with human parechovirus HPeV-3.DiscussionThese findings reveal significant genetic diversity and regional adaptation of HuV in cattle populations. The virus is associated with gastrointestinal symptoms, especially in areas with suboptimal farming conditions, and exhibits a potential for zoonotic transmission. This study provides a foundation for further research into the virus’s pathogenicity and zoonotic risk, highlighting the need for continued surveillance to monitor its spread and evolution.

## Enterobactin and salmochelin S4 inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus

date: 2025-03-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

There is increasing demand for novel antimicrobial agents to tackle the antimicrobial resistance crisis. Here we report that two Enterobacteriaceae-produced siderophores, enterobactin and salmochelin S4, inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus isolates, including methicillin-resistance S. aureus (MRSA) clinical isolates. The IC50 for different S. aureus isolates were 2-5 µM for salmochelin S4 and 5-10 µM for enterobactin. This inhibitory activity was partially repressed by adding Fe+3. These siderophores also inhibited the growth of Enterococcus strains, including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) clinical isolates, though less effectively than for S. aureus. The growth of various Gram-negative bacteria was barely affected by these siderophores. These results shed new light on the role of enterobactin and salmochelin in bacterial physiology and ecology and have potential for the development of novel strategies to combat the rapid rise of multidrug-resistant bacteria.

## Rapid detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae CARDS toxin in clinical respiratory specimens by a loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay

date: 2025-03-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

In light of the absence of rapid and precise diagnostic laboratory tests for the detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP), a prominent etiological agent implicated in a range of respiratory infections, we developed and evaluated a rapid and straightforward loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay targeting the MP community-acquired respiratory distress syndrome toxin (CARDS TX) gene. The LAMP assay was performed at 65°C for a duration of 60 min, yielding a minimum detection concentration of MP CARDS TX at 0.4986 pg/μl. The assay exhibited no cross-reactivity with 13 other prevalent pathogens associated with respiratory infections or with other common bacterial toxin genes. To further substantiate the validity of the LAMP assay, 200 pharyngeal swabs or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were collected from inpatients diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) between June 2021 and July 2022. The results were compared with those obtained by the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method for verification purposes. Of the 200 clinical specimens, 11 exhibited positive results for MP by LAMP and 10 displayed positive results for MP by qPCR (P = 1.000). In summary, a sensitive, specific, straightforward, and expeditious LAMP method for CARDS TX identification was developed to facilitate rapid detection of MP in point-of-care settings. This assay enables early and accurate diagnosis, even in resource-limited environments, which is important for proper antibiotic treatment and prognosis of MP infection.

## Optimized oxygen therapy improves sleep deprivation-induced cardiac dysfunction through gut microbiota

date: 2025-03-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Adequate sleep is of paramount importance for relieving stress and restoring mental vigor. However, the adverse physiological and pathological responses resulting from sleep insufficiency or sleep deprivation (SD) are becoming increasingly prevalent. Currently, the impact of sleep deficiency on gut microbiota and microbiota-associated human diseases, especially cardiac diseases, remains controversial. Here, we employed the following methods: constructed an experimental sleep-deprivation model in mice; conducted 16S rRNA sequencing to investigate the changes in gut microbiota; through fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments, transplanted fecal microbiota from sleep-deprived mice to other mice; established an environment with a 30% oxygen concentration to explore the therapeutic effects of oxygen therapy on gut microbiota-associated cardiac fibrosis and dysfunction; and utilized transcriptome data to study the underlying mechanisms of oxygen therapy. The results revealed that: sleep-deprived mice exhibited weakness, depression-like behaviors, and dysfunction in multiple organs. Pathogenic cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis occurred in sleep-deprived mice, accompanied by poor ejection fraction and fractional shortening. 16S rRNA sequencing indicated that sleep deprivation induced pathogenic effects on gut microbiota, and similar phenomena were also observed in mice that received fecal microbiota from sleep-deprived mice in the FMT experiments. The environment with a 30% oxygen concentration effectively alleviated the pathological impacts on cardiac function. Transcriptome data showed that oxygen therapy targeted several hypoxia-dependent pathways and inhibited the production of cardiac collagen. In conclusion, these results demonstrate the significance of sufficient sleep for gut microbiota and may represent a potential therapeutic strategy, where the oxygen environment exerts a protective effect on insomniacs through gut microbiota.

## Investigating the Gut Microbiota Profile in Prehypertensive Individuals Exhibiting Phlegm-Dampness Constitution

date: 2025-03-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundPrehypertension is the preclinical stage of hypertension, which is more likely to develop into hypertension than normal blood pressure. Although the body may experience pathological changes at this stage, there are often no symptoms. Chinese medicine constitution theory is widely used to assess an individual’s health and disease status, which provides a new method for disease prevention. The phlegm-dampness constitution (PDC) is the main constitution in prehypertension. Dysbiosis of the intestinal flora is considered to be related to the development of hypertension. However, the characteristics of the intestinal flora in prehypertensive populations with PDCs are still unknown.Methods16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal samples was performed in this study, which included 30 prehypertensive subjects with PDCs, 30 nonphlegm-dampness constitution (NPDC) prehypertensive individuals with balanced constitution, and 30 ideal blood pressure subjects with balanced constitution (BC). On the basis of the composition of the intestinal flora, a random forest classifier was constructed to screen the specific bacteria of the prehypertensive PDC population, and the diagnostic efficiency was determined by the area under the curve (AUC).ResultsAt the phylum level, the abundance of Bacteroidetes decreased in the PDC group compared with the NPDC group. Bacteroides was the most important genus at the genus level. Compared with those in the NPDC or BC group, the relative abundances of o_RF39, f_Porphyromonadaceae, f_Christensenellaceae, g_parabacteroides, and g_nitrobacteria in the PDC group were significantly greater. The random forest analysis results revealed that Alistipes, Butyricimonas, Odoribacter, Parabacteroides, and Corynebacterium are bacterial genera that significantly differ between the PDC and NPDC groups and greatly contribute to group differentiation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that the AUC range of differential bacteria and its combined diagnostic model ranged from 0.653 (95% CI: 0.511–0.794) to 0.706 (95% CI: 0.573–0.838), suggesting that it is a potential risk marker for phlegm-dampness constitution with prehypertension.ConclusionsOur study indicates that PDC individuals with prehypertension can be distinguished from NPDC individuals according to their gut microbiome characteristics. Prevention and treatment measures based on these biomarkers may be beneficial in opening new ideas and directions for identifying more aggressive and effective interventions for prehypertensive populations.

## Significance of the gut tract in the therapeutic mechanisms of polydopamine for acute cerebral infarction: neuro-immune interaction through the gut-brain axis

date: 2025-03-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundRecent research has made significant progress in elucidating gastrointestinal complications following acute cerebral infarction (ACI), which includes disorders in intestinal motility and dysbiosis of the gut microbiota. Nevertheless, the role of the gut (which is acknowledged as being the largest immune organ) in the immunoreactive effects of polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA) on acute ischemic stroke remains inadequately understood. In addition to its function in nutrient absorption, the gut acts as a protective barrier against microbes. Systemic immune responses, which are triggered by the disruption of gut barrier integrity, are considered as one of the mechanisms underlying acute ischemic stroke, with the gut-brain axis (GBA) playing a pivotal role in this process.MethodsIn this study, we used a PDA intervention in an ACI model to investigate ACI-like behavior, intestinal barrier function, central and peripheral inflammation, and hippocampal neuron excitability, thus aiming to elucidate the mechanisms through which PDA improves ACI via the GBA.ResultsOur findings indicated that as ACI mice experienced dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and intestinal barrier damage, the levels of proinflammatory factors in the serum and brain significantly increased. Additionally, the activation of astrocytes in the hippocampal region and neuronal apoptosis were observed in ACI mice. Importantly, our study is the first to provide evidence demonstrating that PDA effectively suppresses the neuroimmune interactions of the gut-brain axis and significantly improves intestinal epithelial barrier integrity.ConclusionWe hope that our discoveries will serve as a foundation for further explorations of the therapeutic mechanisms of PDA in ACI, particularly in elucidating the protective roles of gut microbiota and intestinal barrier function, as well as in the development of more targeted clinical interventions for ACI.

## Macrolide resistance in Mycoplasma pneumoniae in adult patients

date: 2025-03-04, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is one of the most significant pathogens responsible for<br>respiratory infections in humans. Macrolides are recommended as the first-line treatment for M. pneumoniae infection. The prevalence of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae has increased significantly in recent decades, particularly in China. The mechanisms of resistance in M. pneumoniae to macrolides have been extensively studied in pediatric patients. However, a paucity reports regarding the resistance characteristics and mechanisms exhibited in adults. The aim of this study was to elucidate the resistance of M. pneumoniae to macrolides and the underlying mechanisms in adult patients. Pharyngeal swab specimens were collected from adult patients presenting with subacute cough or community-acquired pneumonia at our hospital from January 2011 to June 2017 to identify and isolate M. pneumoniae strains. The antimicrobial susceptibility of these isolates to 3 macrolide antibiotics was assessed using broth microdilution method. The 23S rRNA genes of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae strains were sequenced, and the presence of target methylation genes (ermA, ermB, and ermC), efflux pump genes (mefA, mefA/E, msrA, and msrA/B), and the macrolide resistance gene mphC was identified through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Additionally, MICs were determined with and without the efflux pump inhibitor reserpine. A total of 72 M. pneumoniae strains were isolated from adult patients, with 41.7% (30/72) exhibiting macrolide resistance. Among the 3 macrolides tested, the 16-membered-ring midecamycin exhibited the greatest activity (MIC90: 16 µg/ml) against M. pneumoniae. All macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae strains harbored mutations at the 2063 site in domain V of the 23S rRNA gene. Two macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae clinical isolates were found to harbor the efflux pump genes msrA/B and mefA. The efflux pump inhibitor reserpine reduced the MIC for azithromycin in these two strains to a quarter of their original values. In summary, macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae is commonly observed among adults in Beijing. Point mutations are the primary mechanism responsible for macrolide resistance in adults with M. pneumoniae. Additionally, the efflux pump mechanism may contribute partially to this resistance. Midecamycin presents a promising alternative drug for treating M. pneumoniae infections, particularly in cases of azithromycin-resistant M. pneumoniae infection in young children.

## First environmental survey of Scedosporium species in Lebanon

date: 2025-03-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundScedosporium species are filamentous fungi causing a wide spectrum of infections in healthy and debilitated individuals. Despite their clinical significance, the ecology of Scedosporium species remains understudied, particularly in the Middle East.MethodsIn this context, we conducted an environmental study to elucidate the distribution and ecological preferences of Scedosporium species in the North of Lebanon. One hundred and fifty-five soil samples were collected from different environmental areas and analyzed for several chemical parameters. Scedosporium isolates were then selected for species identification and genotyping.ResultsOverall, 39 (25.16%) were positive for Scedosporium species, with a predominance of S. apiospermum (80.56%). Soil analysis revealed associations between the fungal presence and pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic matter content. Moreover, genotyping analysis using MultiLocus Sequence Typing identified five major clusters. Interestingly, a number of Lebanese isolates formed an Asian-specific cluster (V) with one clinical Chinese isolate, whereas two clusters (II and III) showed a close association with German isolates, and clusters (I and IV) contained isolates with a global distribution.ConclusionThese findings provide new insights into the ecology of Scedosporium species, bridging a gap in our knowledge of their distribution on the Asian continent and laying the groundwork for future clinical investigations. Future international collaborations are essential to trace the origin of S. apiospermum.

## Antibacterial and antibiofilm activities of star anise-cinnamon essential oil against multidrug-resistant Salmonella Thompson

date: 2025-03-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

IntroductionThe emergence of foodborne multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella has attracted considerable global attention. Given that food is the primary transmission route, our study focuses on Bellamya quadrata, a freshwater snail that is commonly consumed as a specialty food in Guangxi, China.MethodsEight MDR Salmonella strains were isolated from Bellamya quadrata samples collected across various markets. Previous animal experiments have confirmed their lethality in mice. We determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices of cinnamon essential oil (CEO) and star anise essential oil (SAEO) using the microdilution plate and checkerboard methods. The time-kill curve method was employed to assess the antibacterial activity of the cinnamon-star anise essential oil (SCEO) against planktonic MDR Salmonella. The alkaline phosphatase assay and fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that SCEO causes damage to bacterial cell walls and membranes. Crystal violet staining and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to observe changes in biofilms after SCEO treatment. Quantitative real-time PCR was utilized to analyze the expression of genes related to biofilm formation following SCEO treatment.ResultsThe MIC of SAEO was determined to be 25 mg/mL, whereas that of CEO was significantly lower at 0.62 mg/mL. The FIC index calculated was 0.375, which suggests a synergistic interaction between the two. When SCEO was used in combination at specific ratios, it demonstrated enhanced antibacterial and anti-biofilm capabilities compared to the individual effects of CEO or SAEO, potentially through the disruption of bacterial cell membranes and cell walls. However, in Salmonella treated with SCEO, an upregulation in the expression of biofilm-associated genes was observed, including csgA, adrA, bcsA, and csgD. This increase may be attributed to stress-induced transcriptional responses within the bacteria.DiscussionSCEO significantly impacts cell wall integrity, suggesting its crucial role in reducing biofilm formation. These findings indicate that SCEO holds potential as an alternative to traditional antibiotics and merits further scientific investigation and development.

## Targeting CD4+ T cells through gut microbiota: therapeutic potential of traditional Chinese medicine in inflammatory bowel disease

date: 2025-03-03, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic relapsing inflammation of the intestinal tract. Gut microbiota (GM) and CD4+T cells are important in the development of IBD. A lot of studies have shown that GM and their metabolites like short-chain fatty acids, bile acids and tryptophan can be involved in the differentiation of CD4+T cells through various mechanisms, which in turn regulate the immune homeostasis of the IBD patients. Therefore, regulating CD4+T cells through GM may be a potential therapeutic direction for the treatment of IBD. Many studies have shown that Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulas and some herbal extracts can affect CD4+T cell differentiation by regulating GM and its metabolites. In this review, we mainly focus on the role of GM and their metabolites in regulating the differentiation of CD4+T cells and their correlation with IBD. We also summarize the current research progress on the regulation of this process by TCM.
