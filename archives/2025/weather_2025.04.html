Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0648 AM CST Wed Jan 29 2025

Valid 291300Z - 301200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR CENTRAL AND
NORTH TEXAS...

...SUMMARY...
A few strong to severe thunderstorms will be possible across parts
of the southern Great Plains tonight.

..Southern Great Plains...
Water-vapor imagery this morning shows a closed upper low over the
Desert Southwest.  This upper feature will gradually move eastward
through daybreak Thursday reaching the Sangre de Cristos. 
Widespread cloud cover over central/eastern TX into OK will tend to
limit diurnal heating today.  Southerly low-level flow over
south/coastal TX will slowly intensify as a still modifying airmass
over the western Gulf of America moves inland into the TX Hill
Country.  Isolated thunderstorms may develop later this afternoon
over northeast TX into AR but weak elevated instability will limit
storm intensity.  

By mid to late evening, prior moistening during the day into the
early evening will yield weak instability (250-1000 J/kg MUCAPE)
from west-central TX north-northeastward into southern OK.  The
arrival of stronger large-scale ascent associated with the
approaching upper low and Pacific cold front will facilitate the
development of showers/thunderstorms from central TX into southern
OK.  Relatively cool 500-mb temperatures around -16 deg C will
support a potential risk for large hail with a few of the stronger
updrafts.  Convective coverage is forecast to quickly increase
during the late evening/overnight timeframe as storms become
oriented in a large band.  An accompanying risk for isolated strong
to locally severe will likely continue through the overnight.  A
surface-based warm sector may eventually be encountered by storms on
the southern portion of the band near the I-35 corridor overnight. 
A marginal risk for severe gusts and perhaps a tornado could develop
with this activity.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0145 AM CST Wed Jan 29 2025

Valid 301200Z - 311200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Fire weather potential appears limited across the country on
Thursday, though some concerns may emerge across the Big Bend region
of southern Texas depending on fuel trends over the next 48 hours.
The upper low currently over the Southwest is expected to eject into
the southern Plains through late Thursday. Surface cyclogenesis is
expected to become more pronounced Thursday afternoon across the
central Plains, resulting in strengthening pressure gradient winds
across much of TX. Westerly winds between 15-25 mph will be common,
and dry air advection, coupled with deep boundary-layer mixing, will
promote RH reductions down to 15-20% across the greater Big Bend
region. Recent ensemble guidance shows reasonably high probabilities
for sustained elevated fire weather conditions across this region
with low to moderate probabilities (30-50%) for critical conditions.
While confidence in reasonably high for at least elevated fire
weather conditions, fuels across this region are not overly
receptive with ERCs generally below the 80th percentile and 10-hour
fuel moisture values above the 50th percentile. Fire weather
highlights may be needed in future forecast updated if fine fuels
can sufficiently dry by Thursday afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 0056
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0633 AM CST Tue Jan 28 2025

Areas affected...the Upper Michigan vicinity

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 281233Z - 281700Z

SUMMARY...A period of heavy snow, at rates on the order of 1-2+
inches per hour, appears possible in a corridor overspreading the
central Upper Peninsula of Michigan vicinity by midday.

DISCUSSION...Downstream of a low-amplitude short wave perturbation,
accompanying an intense (110+ kt at 500 mb) jet streak digging
east-southeast of the Canadian Prairies, lower/mid-tropospheric warm
advection is overspreading the Upper Midwest into Great Lakes
region.  Associated forcing for ascent is becoming focused across
the southwestern flank of an arctic air mass now entrenched across
much of the Great Lakes region, particularly near a zone of strong
lower/mid-tropospheric frontogenesis, which is forecast to shift
from northwestern Ontario across the western Lake Superior and
central Upper Peninsula of Michigan vicinity through 17-18z.

Forecast soundings across this region indicate that the sub-freezing
thermodynamic profiles are in the process of saturating, ahead of an
ongoing band of moderate to heavy snow, which appears likely to be
maintained through at least early afternoon.  Temperatures appear
within a few degrees of -15C through an initially deep layer from
lower-levels into the 700-600 mb layer, where conditions will be
most conducive to large dendritic ice crystal growth.  Coinciding
with maximizing lift associated with the frontogenetic forcing, it
appears that this may support a 2-3 hour period of heavy snow rates
on the order of 1-2 inches per hour.  Forecast soundings also
indicate that a layer a steepening mid-level lapse rates may be
accompanied by the development of weak CAPE and embedded convective
development with heavier snow rates possible.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0359 AM CST Sun Jan 26 2025

Valid 291200Z - 031200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Wednesday/Day 4 to Thursday/Day 5...
A mid-level low is forecast to move eastward across the Desert
Southwest from Wednesday/Day 4 into Thursday/Day 5. Low-level
moisture advection will take place ahead of the system across the
southern Plains on Wednesday into Wednesday night, with surface
dewpoints increasing into the 60s F across parts of the southern
Plains. Scattered to numerous thunderstorms appear likely to develop
across the western part of the moist sector Wednesday night across
much of central and northern Texas, as large-scale ascent increases
ahead of the approaching system. This, combined with increasing
instability, and strong deep-layer shear along the western edge of
the moist sector should result in a severe threat late Wednesday
night. A cluster of strong and potentially severe storms may develop
in west-central Texas, with the severe threat persisting into
Thursday, as an MCS moves eastward across the southern Plains.
Supercells with isolated large hail and wind damage will be
possible. There is some concern that moisture return could be slower
than forecast. However, the strength of the system could help to
overcome instability concerns, and it appears a severe threat will
be possible as the mid-level jet ejects northeastward into the
southern Plains from Wednesday night into Thursday.

...Friday/Day 6 and Sunday/Day 8...
The mid-level trough is forecast to move across the southern Plains
on Friday/Day 6, as a cold front advances eastward into the lower
Mississippi Valley. On Saturday/Day 7 and Sunday/Day 8, this front
is forecast to move across the eastern U.S. Although thunderstorms
will be possible along and ahead of the front, instability is
forecast to be very weak suggesting a severe threat will be
unlikely.
