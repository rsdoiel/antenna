The telematics experts at Geotab analyzed aggregated data from thousands
connected commercial vehicles throughout 2024. Using data-driven
insights that focused on US truck stop locations and medium- and
heavy-duty electric vehicle driving range, Geotab found what we already
knew: <strong>electric vehicles are real road ready, right now</strong>.

There’s a reason the phrase “you get what you pay for” has stuck around
for so long – because it’s usually true. And when it comes to electric
bikes, that old saying might be more important than ever.

With the Tesla Semi making headlines consistently since its first public
appearance <em>waaay</em> back back in 2017, you might think they were
some kind of market leaders. Meanwhile, Volvo Trucks has quietly
delivered its 5,000th electric semi truck … and they’re just getting
started.

<p>
No matter how badly a fleet may want to electrify, harsh economic
realities and the greater up-front costs typically associated with
battery electric remain high hurdles to overcome — but a new retrofit
option from French equipment manufacturer Manitou could help lower those
barriers.

bikes that includes new carbon models, upgraded folding designs, and a
growing portfolio of electric two-wheelers aimed at changing how people
get around cities.

<p>
A major part of the reveal centered around
<a href="http://www.dahon.com">Dahon’s</a> latest innovation, a patented
frame platform called DAHON‑V, which promises significantly improved
stiffness and aerodynamics, especially on folding and road bikes.
