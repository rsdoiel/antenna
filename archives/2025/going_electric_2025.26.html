<p>
Police across the US are cracking down on illegal use of out-of-class
e-bikes or non-street-legal electric motorcycles used on public roads.
It used to be that if you sped off on an illegal electric dirt bike or
mini bike after a traffic stop in California, there was a good chance
you’d get away. Most police departments don’t want to engage in
high-speed chases over these types of violations, especially if the
rider isn’t wearing a helmet or is weaving through dense traffic. And
since these types of bikes almost never have license plates, merely
outrunning or outmaneuvering a police cruiser through some bushes or
over a sidewalk was usually enough to evade justice. But lately, a new
kind of chase is happening – from above.

The Dodge Charger Daytona EV made headlines when it rolled out fake

it turns out, they weren’t the right sort of fake engine noises – and
now Stellantis has to recall 8,000 of them for a fix.
