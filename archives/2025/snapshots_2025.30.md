## N5 Mini: Build your own 5-bay NAS using a mini PC mainboard and 3D printed chassis

date: 2025-07-28, from: Liliputing

<p>There are a growing number of network-attached storage (NAS) hardware available from Chinese companies like UGREEN, Beelink, AOOSTAR, and MINISFORUM. But why buy an entirely new computer if you&#8217;ve already got a spare mini PC lying around? The N5 Mini is a DIY network-attached storage device that combines some off-the-shelf components, 3D printed parts, and whatever [&#8230;]</p>

## No, growing more food does not mean we always need more and more inputs

Many lower-income countries do, but high and middle-income countries have reduced fertilisers, pesticides, labour, and land without reducing food production.

## TIL: Exception.add_note

<p><strong><a href="https://daniel.feldroy.com/posts/til-2025-05-exception-add_note">TIL: Exception.add_note</a></strong></p>
Neat tip from Danny Roy Greenfeld: Python 3.11 added a <code>.add_note(message: str)</code> method to the <code>BaseException</code> class, which means you can add one or more extra notes to any Python exception and they'll be displayed in the stacktrace!</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0678/">PEP 678 – Enriching Exceptions with Notes</a> by Zac Hatfield-Dodds proposing the new feature back in 2021.

## Enough AI copilots! We need AI HUDs

date: 2025-07-27, updated: 2025-07-27, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://www.geoffreylitt.com/2025/07/27/enough-ai-copilots-we-need-ai-huds">Enough AI copilots! We need AI HUDs</a></strong></p>
Geoffrey Litt compares Copilots - AI assistants that you engage in dialog with and work with you to complete a task - with HUDs, Head-Up Displays, which enhance your working environment in less intrusive ways.</p>
<p>He uses spellcheck as an obvious example, providing underlines for incorrectly spelt words, and then suggests his <a href="https://www.geoffreylitt.com/2024/12/22/making-programming-more-fun-with-an-ai-generated-debugger">AI-implemented custom debugging UI</a> as a more ambitious implementation of that pattern.</p>
<p>Plenty of people have expressed interest in LLM-backed interfaces that go beyond chat or editor autocomplete. I think HUDs offer a really interesting way to frame one approach to that design challenge.

<p>I made some <a href="https://ino.is/stutter" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Stutter</a> updates this weekend. Version 2.2.2 is available on Firefox and supports pretty much every language now for basic operations. I have hyphenization (breaking up very long words into parts) working in about 40 languages.</p><p>There's also a new option in settings to blur the background when Stutter is running, if that helps you concentrate.</p><p>Chrome and Edge have updates in the pipeline. They should land sometime this week.</p>
