<h2 id="on-government-efficiency">On government efficiency</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
<tt>It’s a secret to everyone! This post is for RSS subscribers only.
<a href="https://daverupert.com/rss-club/">Read more about RSS Club</a>.
</tt>
</p>
<p>
I used to believe that the goal of the government should be efficiency.
If the government was more efficient (waves hands broadly in the air),
you could get rid of waste (again, waiving hands) and you’d need less
taxes, and that would trickle down as more money for people, and you’d
need less welfare (more hands), less red tape, and less bureaucracy.
</p>
<p>
I’ve changed my thinking on the subject. I now think the goal of the
government should be to absorb inefficiencies.
</p>
<p>
As efficient as the fabled invisible hand of the market might be at
lowering the costs of goods and services
<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> and
creating
jobs<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> …
there are often non-economic inefficiencies that come from rapidly
scaling to produce cheaper goods in the infinite money machine. Rather
than ignore those inefficiencies, I think the government should
understand the ways the system breaks and invest in longer term ideas
than making the stock market go up during the next quarter.
</p>
<p>
Here’s a short list of market inefficiencies where I think a government
helps:
</p>
<p>
<strong>Social Security and Medicare.</strong> Unpopular opinion, but I
sort of do see social security as a Ponzi scheme; younger people at the
bottom fund older people at the top who “got in first”. But you know
what’s a bigger problem? Elderly adults retiring with no retirement
plan. In our “Buy the latest iPhone” society,
<a href="https://usafacts.org/data-projects/retirement-savings">people
are statistically bad at planning for their own future</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Environment.</strong> The free hand of the market doesn’t
nudge companies towards making responsible environmental decisions. Even
though electrification is more efficient than carbon, the invisible hand
is taking its sweet time moving over to it. Probably because the
invisible hand gave too much money to the oil companies. We spend
billions in aid for “once in a lifetime” acts of God that happen every
year now. The “more efficient” act would be to kill carbon. We need a
government to protect the non-monetizable resources that give us life
like oceans, lakes, rivers, underground reservoirs, the air we breathe,
and our forests.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Healthcare.</strong> I hate the American healthcare system. We
pay too much for too little. We don’t pay for healthcare, we pay for
insurance company lawyers to haggle about medical codes. Doctors hate
it. Patients hate it. Insurance companies reek of greed and corruption.
And each of us “doing our own research” isn’t a great because you end up
with people turning themselves blue from colloidal silver. We probably
need real doctors. And because most folks don’t need a doctor all the
time, we probably need health insurance. The current system is a handful
of state-by-state monopolies. But we know (according to Metcalfe’s law)
that the value of a network is proportional to the number of connected
users on the system. It would seem the best way to dodge insurance
marketplace inefficiencies like rising costs and low quality care would
be to have the biggest network possible (say, 330 million people?) to
create the best safety net. The market is not getting us the best price.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Defense.</strong> Every American owning their own personal tank
and missile system would be an inefficient stupid way to defend our
country. It’s probably best to centralize the cost of Defense and hire
trained armed service members for that purpose. I’m not advocating for
more military –I’d personally prefer less– but security is a core need
and it manifests at a nation-state level.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Transportation.</strong> I don’t think individuals should plan
and build their own highways. I’d like a government to do that. I also
think every American owning their own car that sits parked 95% of the
time is a waste of money and space, even if it does make the GDP chart
go up. You need a big extra room to store cars at home and a downtown
filled with concrete ramps to store cars at work. Or an enormous parking
lot to store cars at the store. Is this not a form waste? There’s no way
a train makes money and is a profitable business… but more trains equals
less traffic. We know adding new
<a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2020/1/27/how-much-does-a-mile-of-road-actually-cost">ten
million dollar a mile</a> lanes to an already impossibly wide interstate
creates more traffic, more road rage, and more traffic deaths. That is
folly and an inefficiency governments can step in and solve.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Education.</strong> Education is a big expense. But you know
what’s more expensive? Everyone being stupid. That’s a joke… partially.
What is more expensive is everyone sourcing and paying for private
schools; most parents would not do it. You’d end up with a future labor
force with a lot less education. I think my biggest takeaway from school
closures during COVID was how glad I am the public education system
exists. Parents can work jobs, do commerce, and it allows kids to learn
and play with other kids from a cross-section of incomes, ethnic groups,
and special needs. The 1:20+ teacher-student ratio couldn’t be more
efficient in regards to childcare. If anything we need more teachers and
classrooms to keep that ratio as low as possible so education quality
goes up. Oh, and school breakfasts and lunches are super efficient too.
You can feed kids for like $1/kid, there’s no way I can hit those
numbers at home. I can’t believe this is contentious. Let kids eat.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Scientific Research.</strong> Space is expensive to get to, only
billionaires can afford it. Isn’t it nice that the government sometimes
foots the bill for scientists to also go? Beyond space, efforts like
curing cancer, computer research, or finding a new species of spider…
these are not an ultra-efficient use of funds but those discoveries
power innovation. The market doesn’t fund Science unless it makes money
in an A/B test. We’d end up with more patent-pending boner pills instead
of understanding of our universe. Real science is a bunch of inefficient
question and answer seeking that changes the course of human history.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Human Rights.</strong> One way to drive down costs under
Capitalism is to hire labor at the cheapest rate possible. Historically,
our great nation has relied on slaves (yikes!) and children (yikes!) for
cheap sources of labor. You’d have to work long hours for low pay and
then a machine would cut off your arm and your employer would say “Well,
you can’t work here anymore” and kick you out. Isn’t it great to have a
government to correct this moral inefficiency? It didn’t happen
overnight, of course. Countless churches and patriotic do-gooders were
fine with justifying and upholding the old system. Even fought a war
about it.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
I could keep going, but there’s a billion and one jobs a government can
do to improve the life and well-being of its citizens. I guess I’m still
thinking about efficiency… but from the opposite angle. A government is
perhaps best-situated to absorb inefficiencies at scale. Will there be
inefficiency and waste and kingdom-building within a super-system like a
government? For sure. Systems should always seek to improve. To begin
fixing those problems you need data and transparency.
</p>
<p>
The more you understand Capitalism, the more you understand it’s a game.
It’s a game with an enormous exploit. I’m talking Blanka in the corner
levels of bullshit. The government <em>should</em> exist to fix those
systems and curb those bad actors. But the system continues to reward
them and heap tax break after tax break as a reward to their fellow
co-conspirators in exchange for campaign contributions and lavish trips.
Talk about inefficiency. Dumping piles of money into the hands of people
who already have money. Sheesh.

<h1 id="2025-02-02-dungeons-and-wilderness-and-politics">
2025-02-02 Dungeons and Wilderness and Politics
</h1>
<p>
Last year, I wrote that <a href="2024-08-19-rpg-intrigue">I’d like to
see a system for how to run an intrigue as a party</a>. I think the core
of that idea is in this paragraph:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
What if B/X D&amp;D went levels 1–3 is for dungeons, 4–6 is for the
wilderness and 7–9 is for politics. Doesn’t that sound fantastic? What
sort of rules would you find in that third book? You would not get to
name level by being a colonizer and clearing the land but by taking over
an existing position of power – through intrigue. Oust the abbot, kick
out the bishop, marry into the baron’s family, take over the guild. With
the help of your friends. Without resorting to combat, but with dice
rolling.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a href="https://www.patreon.com/bjmurray">Brad J. Murray</a> saw this
and started writing a document, riffing on the idea. He invited me to
collaborate, I wrote some more, but then it didn’t go anywhere. I’m not
sure what to do next. It’s already much better than that vague idea I
had, but it’s not ready to be turned into a 20 page pamphlet. I feel
that it’s getting closer, though.
</p>
<p>
Since we weren’t doing anything with the document, I figured I might as
well post what we have. Perhaps you want to run with it? Make a copy,
make some changes, let us know?
</p>
<p>
Here goes.
</p>
<h2 id="premise">
Premise
</h2>
<p>
Traditional dungeon and/or dragon games progress character in levels:
discrete units of capability. Each is a steady increase in power, almost
entirely in terms of how big a thing you can kill (or how easily you can
kill a smaller thing). This creates a certain kind of play arc that can
become tedious as you realise that narratively the same thing is
happening, it’s just that the fights take longer. At least when it’s
executed weakly, and it is very easy to execute it weakly.
</p>
<p>
Instead of a power scale, levels can be grouped into a thematic
progression where you gain more power but the context in which you
execute the power changes. In order to progress into the next tier, you
must accomplish something that leads naturally into that tier.
</p>
<p>
The tiers are: from levels 1 through 3 you are in dungeons. Small(ish)
set piece events in a structure full of enemies and loot. You acquire
things, you kill things, and maybe you make some alliances within the
dungeon context. The launching point of your dungeon excursions – a
hamlet, a city, or what-have-you may reward you but certainly
appreciates you and also keeps you informed of dungeons that need your
attention.
</p>
<p>
From levels 4 through 6 you are in the wilderness. The enemies are a
little more random and of more widely ranging power. Sometimes you need
to fight but often you need to hide or run. You are trying to get from
safe place to safe place navigating distinctly unsafe places between.
You are acquiring knowledge of multiple communities, places, enemies and
friends.
</p>
<p>
From levels 7 through 9 you are a leader. Your interests are political.
You have gone from wandering between communities and serving them to
attempting to create one or lead an existing one. Your interest is the
well-being and even growth of a community in the context of a world with
many desperate communities surrounded by dangerous wilderness. You will
likely need to hire some dungeoneers and couriers. Pest control and
deadly mail carriage.
</p>
<p>
At level 10 you turn into a patron or nemesis for the players of your
next campaign.
</p>
<p>
Within a tier you become more powerful but in your tier context. In the
wilderness you might become a little better at fighting but mostly you
get better at navigating and hiding and planning. You become a rider of
exotic mounts and become known for your successes. And maybe your
failures. And in your political years you likely don’t get better at
fighting at all but at organizing and communicating and planning and
execution. You learn how to determine who you can trust and who you
can’t.
</p>
<h2 id="level-1-3-the-dungeon-years">
Level 1-3: The Dungeon Years
</h2>
<p>
You will fight things for treasure and, eventually, to serve the needs
of someone else.<br> You will learn fighty things – how to defeat
enemies and locate traps.<br> You will develop a relationship with a
home community.<br> You will learn new tactics, new spells, new powers.
</p>
<h3 id="making-the-home-community">
Making the home community
</h3>
<p>
A handful of non-player characters, representative of surface factions.
They need things from the dungeon. This results in retrieval missions,
rewards, and rumours regarding the mission. Players see the community
leaders they are helping (by selling them their loot) grow in power and
manoeuvre, but likely they don’t care.
</p>
<h3 id="making-a-dungeon">
Making a dungeon
</h3>
<p>
The dungeons contain things that are useful to the patrons in the home
community. The dungeon also has factions and faction leaders, like the
home community, but these factions are there to be exploited by the
players. Ally with these humanoids against these other humanoids or
against the common enemies further down, those nightmare caricatures of
our fellow humans – more cruel, more greedy, more hungry than we are.
The dungeon is the terrible mirror of our fears.
</p>
<p>
(Needs more advice.)
</p>
<h3 id="moving-on">
Moving on
</h3>
<p>
At some point, the need arises to get help from a neighbouring
community. A higher level magic-user is required to break a curse, cure
a disease, reverse a petrification, or raise a dead comrade. This
requires a trip overland and automatically ends the dependence on
dungeon adventures.
</p>
<h2 id="level-4-6-the-wilderness-years">
Level 4-6: The Wilderness Years
</h2>
<p>
You will travel in the service of communities and eventually be sought
for service and advice.<br> You will learn desperate things — how to
avoid danger, how to ambush, and how to survive the environment.<br> You
will make connections with communities.<br> You will learn to act
strategically, where to fight and where to yield, where to go and when
to go.
</p>
<h3 id="making-connected-communities-and-maps">
Making connected communities and maps
</h3>
<p>
Distribute the following on the map:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Powerful people</strong>: Give them names, titles and retainers
including spells and magic items. Some of them must have skills and
spells such that somewhere between level 3 and 4 players need to travel.
Breaking curses over here, curing diseases over there, a sage to
identify a powerful magic item in that other place.<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Settlements</strong>: Give them names, a small number of
interesting buildings such as defensive structures and temples, and note
the number of people ready to fight in case of a battle. The coming war
will end wilderness exploration and those numbers will be important.<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Ruins</strong>: Create more dungeons, big or small. Since
dungeon exploration is no longer the core activity, think of these more
as lairs. Most have just three to five zones that may or may not map to
“rooms” with monsters and treasure. Dragon lairs, giant fortresses,
bandit camps, druid covens, troll caves. The monsters are big and
powerful, with area attacks like dragons, or large damage output, like
giants, with the potential to destroy buildings and settlements, or they
are contagious and hard to kill like undead and lycanthropes, or they
are numerous and nefarious, taking hostages and setting ambushes.<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Legendary items</strong>: As a consequence of treasure
allocation for the above, some powerful magic items enter the sandbox
and it’s good to have them on a separate list so that there can be
rumours and quests pointing players towards them.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The following create three separate, overlapping and contradicting
networks of loyalties, providing for endless conflict and shifting
alliances between powerful people.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Magic schools</strong>: This is where players get to learn
higher level spells from legendary magic users. If you know their names,
you can name their spell books (this is a copy of “Agrimach’s Grimoir of
Necromancy” from back when he was a wandering battle mage) and players
can go and visit them to learn more spells from the same school. Named
spell collections also facilitate writing up spells for other
magic-users since they can be former students with a subset of these
spells.<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Secret societies</strong>: Give them names and leaders. For each
settlement figure out if the secret society has a presence and if so,
who the representative is.<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Gods &amp; demons and their temples</strong>: Give them names
and themes. For each settlement, figure out if there is a shrine or
temple and if so, who the head priest is.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that monsters show up in multiple guises, here.
</p>
<p>
There are the very dangerous foes living in the ruins mentioned above.
These continue to be based on our nightmares: dragons spreading terror
and devastation, undead sucking the life of the land, or giants making
travel unsafe. The neighbouring communities need the players’ help,
resulting in more wilderness travel. These are opponents that can be
fought by the players, directly.
</p>
<p>
The remaining monsters have societies living in the settlements
mentioned above, just like humans. A few of them live in dystopian
societies that players would like to end: Slavers, brutalisers,
dictatorships. It is important that there are many more neutral
settlements, however. If all the orcs are brutal tribal savages and all
the underground elves are matriarchal slavers, it’s too easy to draw up
conflict along racial lines. It’s better to have one society of brutal
savages looking for plunder and one society of slavers looking for
victims and have the rest be fearful onlookers and “neutral” parties.
Organising them, solving their problems and forging alliances is what
this tier is about.
</p>
<h3 id="community-objectives-and-you">
Community objectives and you
</h3>
<p>
New factions emerge: secret societies, cults, political parties (clans,
families). There are power struggles between them, observable from a
distance (like the political careers of the village non-player
characters). For their struggles, these factions need the help of
players. Invasions have to be fought back, spying missions need to be
carried out, treasure needs to be found (dungeon adventures don’t
necessarily disappear, but the dungeons are far away and dangerous,
necessitating travel through the wilderness.
</p>
<h3 id="wilderness-encounters">
Wilderness encounters
</h3>
<p>
Wilderness encounters do not happen in tiers like encounters in dungeon
levels where deeper means tougher. The wilderness has no centre and no
distance – unless there is a colonialist vision of a borderland and the
non-human world is there for the taking. Like slavery, colonialism can
be a topic to explore, but it’s better to be struggling against it than
to glorify it. If there are slaves, players can free them and fight the
slavers. If there are colonisers, players can stop the land grab and the
massacres.
</p>
<p>
The monsters and lairs no longer reflect the nightmares of our childhood
(monsters that eat us, monsters that take what’s ours, monsters that
live in the darkness). Monsters now reflect the nightmares of our adult
lives. Enemies have strongholds from where they sally out and attack our
communities, disrupting our trade, plundering our villages, capturing
our ships. Pirates and bandits, and monstrous equivalents. Conquering
armies, occupational armies.
</p>
<h3 id="moving-on-1">
Moving on
</h3>
<p>
As the game progresses, things come to a head and the players cannot
fight against hundreds of enemies on their own. Allies have to be found
and it all culminates in a big battle or a series of battles. Mass
combat rules are used. And when it’s over, when there’s a power vacuum,
players are ready to move on and fill it.
</p>
<h2 id="level-7-9-the-political-years">
Level 7-9: The Political Years
</h2>
<p>
You will lead a community to wealth or ruin or maybe a little of
both.<br> You will learn how to navigate the pitfalls of leadership.<br>
You will command armies and governments.<br> You will anchor yourself to
something.<br> You will fade away and make room for those that come
after you.
</p>
<h3 id="making-the-political-landscape">
Making the political landscape
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Expand on the list of powerful people</strong>: Add family
members. Families add another layer of overlapping and contradicting
loyalties. Now every important person can be connected to a magic
school, a secret society, a temple, and a family.<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>A list of jobs</strong>: Every settlement, every important
building, every right to harvest is a resource that results in a job for
somebody, a step on the way up for people.
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="making-your-community">
Making your community
</h3>
<p>
Based on the lower tiers of the game, players have hopefully made
alliances with powerful people and their families. Some ways to make
them part of the community:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Family</strong>: Where as before players are mostly interested
in their names and their abilities, now is the time to learn about their
families. Family is always a mixed bag. Some of them have disturbing
tendencies. How do you handle those without triggering a feud? Some of
them need a better place. Can you take them in and care for them, offer
them an education and a career? Meeting new people also means a chance
for romantic interests. Will you be able to create a family of your
own?<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Housing</strong>: The devastation of war and powerful monsters
leads to refugees that need housing. How do you provide for the raw
materials to build camps and to fortify these? How do you transform
these improvised settlements into regular settlements?<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Infrastructure</strong>: Building settlements, wells, walls,
cisterns, granaries, towers, strongholds, roads, dams, aqueducts – this
is the new normal. Sometimes the problems here still allow for short
adventures. Road constructions are blocked because of an unnatural
crocodile infestation. No stones are available because the quarry has
been taken over by kobolds worshipping a medusa. Some of the problems
need political resolutions, however: Perhaps the mine stopped working
because revolutionaries incited the workers into revolt and indeed,
their grievances are justified. Time to step in.<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Tolls and taxes</strong>: Infrastructure takes an immense effort
in gold and manpower. Soldiers need to guard the roads and man the
strongholds. With travel secured, trade brings in revenue. As trade
expands overseas and across mountain passes, securing it becomes more
difficult. Ships have to be built. Soldiers need to be raised and
equipped.<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Jobs</strong>: With many people now depending on you, it’s
important to pick the right advisors, the right second-in-commands.<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Peace</strong>: At this point, people are exhausted from the
war. They want peace. Even if problems could conceivably be resolved by
going to war, they prefer not to. To solve problems by violent
confrontation is now retrograde and frowned upon.
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="threats-to-the-community-you-love">
Threats to the community you love
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Corruption and betrayal</strong>: Whom do you trust? Loyalty is
not a given. People will work for you until you hand them a settlement
to run and they go rogue, allying themselves with stronger neighbours.
People will work for you until you give them a post and then they’ll be
corrupt, asking for bribes and posts for their family. How do you keep
them in check and still get things done? How do you root out traitors
without descending into paranoia and alienating your friends? How do you
handle secret societies and cults?<br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>War</strong>: A war is no longer a question of mass combat rules
used at the end of the previous tier. Player characters are usually not
going on military expeditions. A single die roll determines whether
armies win or lose battles, whether they advance or retreat. What
players care about: How much reinforcements does the army need? How long
are the supply lines and consequentially, how much of the reinforcements
wither away before reaching the army? How many more battles will there
be? How many refugees return from the war?
</li>
<li>
<strong>Revolution</strong>: The machinations of economics produce
inequalities. You need rich people to stay in power and yet rich people
are the causes of revolution. Can you ensure an economy that can stand
against your neighbours without sucking your people dry?
</li>
<li>
<strong>Succession</strong>: You and your party rose to power but the
world is complicated and strange. There are those who can handle it, but
they need to learn how to do it – from you. And as they do, you’ll find
yourself more and more obsolete. Will you get the timing right? Will you
raise people to power in times of need? Will you hold the reins until
they are ready? And will you be able to let go when you’re no longer up
to the task?
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="threats-to-the-people-you-love">
Threats to the people you love
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Power</strong>: Can you manage a peaceful transition that
doesn’t end end with most of your family dead?
</li>
<li>
<strong>Education</strong>: Can you raise your children to be the kind
of people they want to be? Can you uplift your society to be the kind of
citizens they want to be?
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="adventures">
Adventures
</h3>
<p>
Considering the means to build up a community and the threads the
community faces as well as the people you love, consider the following
checklists to generate political adventures.
</p>
<h4 id="a-diplomatic-mission">
A diplomatic mission
</h4>
<p>
<strong>Why</strong>: To marry into a difficult family, to seal an
alliance, to placate a pushy neighbour, to establish an embassy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Act 1, the people involved</strong>: Secure the consent of the
parties involved. Does the bride or groom want to go? Does the diplomat
want the job? Why not? Can you sweeten the deal? Does anybody next to
them object – family, rivals? Can you placate them?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Act 2, controlling public space</strong>: Travelling no longer
means facing monsters but securing adequate lodgings for the entourage.
Is somebody preventing the hosts from fulfilling their obligations? Can
you send agents ahead of the troupe to get this resolved? If not, can
you get it resolved in person without threatening violence?
Alternatively, if you are hosting: Are there people in your community
working against you? How will agents, heralds and advanced parties
react? How do you prevent an escalation?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Act 3, social dynamics</strong>. Is there a hunt, a feast or a
joust to partake in? Do you recite poetry or sing? Do you have the right
people in your employ to entertain the hosts or guests? What gifts will
you exchange? If there are veiled insults, how will you handle them
without violence?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Act 4, diplomacy</strong>. Every demand, every offer, every deal
is met with a counter. What do you have in return? How good are you at
negotiating?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Act 5, the financial aftermath</strong>. When everything is said
and done, check your finances. Did you win or did you lose? Add up the
successes and failures and compare them to the table of financial
consequences. Do you need to borrow gold from merchants and bankers to
pay for all the entertainment, the soldiers, the pageantry? If you have
gold to spare, how will you spend it? Or will you be saving it?
</p>
<h4 id="a-protracted-war">
A protracted war
</h4>
<p>
<strong>Why</strong>: To gain notoriety and glory, to increase your
holdings and thereby gain positions of power to hand to loyal followers.
</p>
<p>
(Insert acts.)
</p>
<h4 id="a-rebellion-to-counter">
A rebellion to counter
</h4>
<p>
<strong>Why</strong>: To secure a hold on an institution or a settlement
that you have recently gained but are in danger of losing again.
</p>
<p>
(Insert acts.)
</p>
<h3 id="ending">
Ending
</h3>
<p>
A successful, peaceful transfer of power to the next in line is the
crowning achievement. The monarchist way to win is to found a family,
have children and pass power to them. The republican way to win is to
found an organisation that can sustain itself. The religious way to win
is to steer the institution and its community through these troubled
times and then to live out those last years in peace. Players win when
peace and stability reigns, at least for a few years.
</p>
<p>
The rules for war ensure that losses can be recovered from by betting
more of what you have. Increase the stakes. At first, you send a
second-in-command and some soldiers to take back those villages. Then
you send reinforcements. You build roads to improve the supply lines.
Perhaps there’s a betrayal and you must send your child to take back
control – or you must go yourself. And if you lose then, your life’s
work collapses. Players lose when civil war and ruin follows a long
period of upheavals.

<p>I rewrote the

needed to focus on linking. The term web is being thrown around too
casually, without regard to what the web is, the same kind of dilution
that’s happening with podcasting. But the <i>social web</i> idea is
fairly new, and it’s really important that we get this right.</p>

what Musk is doing now, do you think the internet will still be here in

Musk, Inc. Will owning things even mean anything? Or is this the
beginning of the rule of the tech bros, world wide. I can’t imagine what
they’re planning for us. In the meantime, me divesting my Tesla, which
seemed so urgent just 24 hours ago, now seems like a powerless gesture.
I heard it said that now feels like the moment in Covid when you
realized everything was about to freeze, and you’d better head to the
supermarket right now, and when you got there, you found you weren’t
among the first to see it this way. I was very reassured by the blog

<h2 id="using-rsync-with-sqlite-databases">2025-01-27 Using rsync with
Sqlite databases</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-01, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-01-27-using-rsync-with-sqlite-databases">
2025-01-27 Using rsync with Sqlite databases
</h1>
<p>
I use Debian stable so my copy of Sqlite is not the latest and greatest.
At the same time, I don’t use Borg Backup for my server. I use rsync.
</p>
<p>
I copy the content of the important server files to my local laptop and
then I make a backup of my laptop to external disks using Borg Backup.
</p>
<p>
When making copies using rsync, the database must not be in use.
Otherwise, a busy database is probably going to be corrupt when
restoring it from backup.
</p>
<p>
The key is to stop all programs using database files before beginning
the backup and restarting them after the backup. It’s also important to
stop these programs using the monitoring software.
</p>
<p>
I use Monit to monitor the server. If I don’t stop the programs using
Monit, Monit will discover that they are not running and restart them
while rsync is still copying the database file. The GoToSocial database
is 10G so copying it takes a long time. Long enough for Monit to
discover that GoToSocial isn’t running to restart it.
</p>
<p>
The programs using database files:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
GoToSocial
</li>
<li>
fail2ban
</li>
<li>
The Lounge
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Watch the log files for messages saying that files changed.
</p>
<p>
This is my script:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

# sibirocobombus.root is defined in ~/.ssh/config

echo Stopping GoToSocial
ssh sibirocobombus.root monit stop gotosocial

echo Stopping fail2ban

<h1 id="2025-01-31-borgbackup-for-the-laptop-and-the-server">
2025-01-31 BorgBackup for the laptop and the server
</h1>
<p>
A few days ago I mentioned the
<a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-01-27-rsync-sqlite">rsync-based
backup script</a> I use to copy data from the server to the laptop.
</p>
<p>
The backup script that makes backups of my laptop (including the backup
from the server) to external disks is different, however.
</p>
<p>
My actual backup uses external disks. I have two of them. One of them is
always at the office. Every now and then (not often enough!) I make a
backup to the external disk I have at hand and then I carry it to the
office and bring the other one back. That is, the laptop and the two
external disks are never in the same location.
</p>
<p>
The two external disks I use are “known backup disks”. When I plug them
in, BorgBackup immediately starts making a backup. I discussed this
setup <a href="2017-12-24_Borg_Backup">back in 2017</a>.
</p>
<p>
I’m just going to repost the stuff and I don’t think there have been any
significant changes.
</p>
<p>
Run commands and create files as root.
</p>
<p>
Either use <code>sudo</code> for every command you run, or use
<code>sudo su</code> once and do everything as root. No matter how you
do it, the danger zone awaits!
</p>
<h2 id="mnt-backup">
<code>/mnt/backup</code>
</h2>
<p>
Create the mount point on the laptop:
</p>
<pre><code>mkdir /mnt/backup
</code></pre>
<h2 id="etc-fstab">
<code>/etc/fstab</code>
</h2>
<p>
Any disk labeled “Backup” will be mounted as <code>/mnt/backup</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>LABEL=Backup /mnt/backup auto nosuid,nodev,nofail,noauto,x-gvfs-show 0 0
</code></pre>
<h2 id="etc-backups-40-backup-rules">
<code>/etc/backups/40-backup.rules</code>
</h2>
<p>
Install a symlink to this file:
</p>
<pre><code>ln -s /etc/backups/40-backup.rules \
      /etc/udev/rules.d/40-backup.rules
</code></pre>
<p>
The file content:
</p>
<pre><code>ACTION==&quot;add&quot;, SUBSYSTEM==&quot;bdi&quot;, DEVPATH==&quot;/devices/virtual/bdi/*&quot;, TAG+=&quot;systemd&quot;, ENV{SYSTEMD_WANTS}=&quot;automatic-backup.service&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>
This makes sure that the service <code>automatic-backup</code> starts
whenever an external disk gets plugged into the laptop.
</p>
<h2 id="etc-backups-automatic-backup-service">
<code>/etc/backups/automatic-backup.service</code>
</h2>
<p>
Install a symlink to this file:
</p>
<pre><code>ln -s /etc/backups/automatic-backup.service \
      /etc/systemd/system/automatic-backup.service
</code></pre>
<p>
The service does nothing except start the <code>run.sh</code> shell
script.
</p>
<pre><code>[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/etc/backups/run.sh
</code></pre>
<h2 id="etc-backups-backup-disks">
<code>/etc/backups/backup.disks</code>
</h2>
<p>
The <code>run.sh</code> below runs for every external disk plugged in.
It’s important to only make backups to known backup disks, however.
</p>
<p>
The known backup disks are identified by their <code>uuid</code> in the
<code>backup.disks</code> file.
</p>
<p>
To list the disk labels and their <code>uuid</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>lsblk -o+uuid,label
</code></pre>
<p>
Add the <code>uuid</code> to the <code>/etc/backups/backup.disks</code>
file.
</p>
<p>
This is the content of the file identifying my backup disks, for
example:
</p>
<pre><code># generate using: lsblk -o+uuid,label
7c478832-5d7f-43d3-9b79-20cfc67fb0e6
bb1c034e-dd21-48e7-a496-1b95685a094d
156cf4df-aa58-421e-b3d0-583fe6fdff4a
</code></pre>
<p>
If you create your copy of the file, your uuids will be different!
</p>
<p>
When you run <code>lsblk -o+uuid,label</code> you’ll also see the device
itself. In my case, that’s <code>/dev/sdb</code>. Create a BorgBackup
repository on the new disk, mount it, create the directory and
initialize the repository.
</p>
<p>
When initializing the repository, you’re asked for a passphrase. You
will need it for the <code>run.sh</code> script.
</p>
<pre><code>mount /dev/sdb /mnt/backup
mkdir /mnt/backup/borg-backups
borg init --encryption=repokey --progress /mnt/backup/borg-backups/backup.borg
umount /mnt/backup
</code></pre>
<p>
Make sure the disk has the correct label! You can do this from the
command-line but I used
<a href="https://apps.gnome.org/en/DiskUtility/">Disks</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="etc-backups-run-sh">
<code>/etc/backups/run.sh</code>
</h2>
<p>
Now we’re ready for the actual script. It checks whether a known backup
disk is mounted under <code>/mnt/backup</code> and if so, it creates a
new archive in the repository.
</p>
<p>
Don’t forget to search for <code>BORG_PASSPHRASE</code> and change it to
whatever you used when you ran <code>borg init</code> above!
</p>
<p>
Hide the passphrase from everybody else and to make it executable:
</p>
<pre><code>chmod 0700 run.sh
</code></pre>
<p>
This the content of the shell script:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash -ue

# The udev rule is not terribly accurate and may trigger our service before
# the kernel has finished probing partitions. Sleep for a bit to ensure
# the kernel is done.

It has just been announced that at the Spring 2025 Membership Meeting of
the <a href="https://cni.org/">Coalition for Networked Information</a>
in Milwaukee, WI April 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup>, Vicky and I
are to receive the
<a href="https://www.cni.org/about-cni/awards/pep-award">Paul Evan
Peters Award</a>. The press release announcing the award is
<a href="https://www.cni.org/news/lockss-co-founders-honored-with-2025-paul-evan-peters-award">here</a>.<br />
<br /> Vicky and I are honored and astonished by this award. Honored
because it is the premiere award in the field, and astonished because we
left the field more than seven years ago to take up our new full-time
career as grandparents. We are all the more astonished because we are
not even eligible for the award; the
<a href="https://www.cni.org/about-cni/awards/pep-award">rules clearly
state that</a> the “award will be granted to <b>an
individual</b>”.<br /> <br /> You can tell this is an extraordinary
honor from the list of previous awardees, and the fact that it is the
first time it has been awarded in successive years. Vicky and I are
extremely grateful to the <a href="https://arl.org">Association of
Research Libraries</a>, <a href="https://cni.org">CNI</a> and
<a href="https://www.educause.edu/">EDUCAUSE</a>, who sponsor the
award.<br /> <br />

<p>Part of the award is the opportunity to make an extended presentation
to open the meeting. The text of our talk, entitled <i>Lessons From
LOCKSS</i>, with links to the sources and information that appeared on
slides but was not spoken, should appear here on April
7<sup>th</sup>.<br /> <br /> The work that the award recognizes was not
ours alone, but the result of a decades-long effort by the entire
<a href="https://www.lockss.org">LOCKSS team</a>. It was made possible
by support from the LOCKSS community and many others, including Michael
Lesk then at NSF, Donald Waters then at the Mellon Foundation, the late
Karen Hunter at Elsevier, Stanford’s Michael Keller and CNI’s Cliff
Lynch.<br /></p>

<p>I’ve been using <a href="https://claude.ai/">claude.ai</a> for
programming work lately, and it does one thing better than ChatGPT. It
reads your code and tries to mimic your coding style. ChatGPT won’t do
that. It’s really frustrating to have to edit their code before I can
even try it out. I like it and am paying the $20 per month in addition
to the money I’m paying ChatGPT.</p>

<h2 id="advice-to-would-be-platform-vendors">Advice to would-be platform
vendors</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-31, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
TL;DR: The key to success is convincing developers to ignore the fact
that you will eventually kill them.
</p>
<p>
Would-be platform vendors, open or not, in order to entice a developer
to learn how it works:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Quick success. Hello World works in less than 30 minutes. Hopefully much
less.
</li>
<li>
Easy to believe that the platform vendor won’t want to kill me. This is
a trick, because based on my experience, they always try to kill you,
eventually.
</li>
<li>
Fun. If I can fill a need that I think users will want, without being
resented too much by the platform vendor then I might take a jump
knowing full well that the better the idea the quicker the vendor will
kill me. For that reason it’s better to do something they don’t
understand, or will see as irrelevant, ie a “third party opportunity.”
As soon as it appears to be “system software,” that’s when they started

The API works the way you think. This has been the highest hurdle for me
to get over in most platforms I think about working with. I can’t tell
you how many times I’ve stared at the docs for a platform and have no
idea how it relates to the product, which I know how to use. The
concepts should mirror the functionality of the system it’s the API for.
Too much theory and I have to be very very motivated for other reasons
to get through the fog.

<li>
It must be relatively easy for you to hang out in a corner where it’s
too hard for them to be worth the trouble.

</ul>
<p>
Thing is if there is a platform vendor, they <i>can</i> kill you, no
matter what they say. I once had a big platform vendor say they weren’t
trying to crush me. I could see on his face he realized he had just
given up their plan, or how else would that term be in his head as
applied to me. Never mind, I was already commited so what difference did
it make.
</p>
<p>
The reason for all this is that as they grow, platform vendors hire
employees to work on this stuff, and they resent independent developers.
This surprised me when I first encountered it. I thought we were
siblings, brothers and sisters. But they idealize our situation and only
see the pain in theirs. So they will enjoy killing you. It will
eventually happen. That’s why it’s generally much better if there is

I’ve been posting extracts every now on then on fedi.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Sabotage varies from highly technical <em>coup de main</em> acts that
require detailed planning and the use of specially trained operatives,
to innumerable simple acts which the ordinary individual
citizen-saboteur can perform. This paper is primarily concerned with the
latter type. Simple sabotage does not require specially prepared tools
or equipment; it is executed by an ordinary citizen who may or may not
act individually and without the necessity for active connection with an
organized group; and it is carried out in such a way as to involve a
minimum danger of injury, detection, and reprisal. –
<a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Simple_Sabotage_Field_Manual/Introduction">OSS
Simple Sabotage Manual, Introduction</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It think it is important to place a premium on minimizing the dangers.
There’s no point in becoming a casualty in the fight against fascism.
There’s no point in losing your job or your life to a fascist.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A second type of simple sabotage requires no destructive tools
whatsoever and produces physical damage, if any, by highly indirect
means. It is based on universal opportunities to make faulty decisions,
to adopt a non-cooperative attitude, and to induce others to follow
suit. Making a faulty decision may be simply a matter of placing tools
in one spot instead of another. A non-cooperative attitude may involve
nothing more than creating an unpleasant situation among one’s fellow
workers, engaging in bickerings, or displaying surliness and stupidity.

<p>
Sometimes you read this manual and start wondering about the people you
meet, co-workers, customers, human resources departments, the whole
chain of command.
</p>
<p>
Here’s to hoping that you and your team are exempt. 😁
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Acts of simple sabotage are occurring throughout Europe. An effort
should be made to add to their efficiency, lessen their detectability,
and increase their number. Acts of simple sabotage, multiplied by
thousands of citizen-saboteurs, can be an effective weapon against the
enemy. Slashing tires, draining fuel tanks, starting fires, starting
arguments, acting stupidly, short-circuiting electric systems, abrading
machine parts will waste materials, man-power, and time. Occurring on a
wide scale, simple sabotage will be a constant and tangible drag on the
war effort of the enemy. –
<a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Simple_Sabotage_Field_Manual/Possible_Effects">OSS
Simple Sabotage Manual, Possible Effects</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
To be part of the constant and tangible drag is the point.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Widespread practice of simple sabotage will harass and demoralize enemy
administrators and police. Further, success may embolden the
citizen-saboteur eventually to find colleagues who can assist him in
sabotage of greater dimensions. Finally, the very practice of simple
sabotage by natives in enemy or occupied territory may make these
individuals identify themselves actively with the United Nations war
effort, and encourage them to assist openly in periods of Allied
invasion and occupation. –

<p>
I’m not sure who our allies are but one thing’s for sure: in times of
trouble we should be looking for allies at all levels of organisation.
And that means doing the work of maintaining relationships.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The ordinary citizen very probably has no immediate personal motive for
committing simple sabotage. Instead, he must be made to anticipate
indirect personal gain, such as might come with enemy evacuation or
destruction of the ruling government group. Gains should be stated as
specifically as possible for the area addressed: simple sabotage will
hasten the day when … and … deputies … will be thrown out, when
particularly obnoxious decrees and restrictions will be abolished, … and
so on. Abstract verbalizations about personal liberty, freedom of the
press, and so on, will not be convincing in most parts of the world. In
many areas they will not even be comprehensible. –
<a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Simple_Sabotage_Field_Manual/Motivating_the_Saboteur">OSS
Simple Sabotage Manual, Motivating the Saboteur</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It’s a stark reminder to read that “personal liberty, freedom of the
press, and so on, will not be convincing” but I think I see it at work,
now.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps this is because the people around me don’t depend on “personal
liberty” for anything. They are free to do as they want because they
want what the new regime is doing. If you want what you are told there
is no need for liberty.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, if your means are so constrained and everything around you
requires money and power, then personal liberty is so constrained that
you don’t fear it’s loss.
</p>
<p>
And for people to want the free press, it’d be nice if the press didn’t
already tow the party line of money and power.
</p>
<p>
I guess in a roundabout way I am trying to say that all dictatorship
requires a large part of the population to acquiesce to it. The movies
might make one think that most people are in the resistance but in fact
they are not. Many are just interested in Ruhe und Ordnung, silence and
order.
</p>
<p>
Sadly, when I first heard about the US sliding into fascism thirty years
ago, I thought it impossible. Unthinkable. And yet here we are.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps it helps to think about a sliding scale from zero to Hitler. The
US is not yet invading Poland. But they seem to be ready to divvy up
Ukraine; or take Greenland. So where are we: 60%? 70%?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I’m not saying don’t do it. I’m not saying to be insubordinate and get
fired so that you could be replaced by a fascist.
</p>
<p>
I’m saying do it slower and with more hand holding.
</p>
<p>
Do it in a way that requires more approvals, and reviews, and “oops we
need to roll that build back because we made a mistake”.
</p>
<p>
Don’t be good at your job when your job is supporting fascism.<br> –

There is something interesting happening with blogging. For a long time,
blogs like this one were <em>the</em> way to opine, to share, to
bloviate. Then social media came along and stole blogging’s thunder,
with the average blogger gravitating towards long threads on Twitter
(<abbr class="initialism">RIP</abbr>; † ⚰; 💀; etc., etc.) or
photo-heavy Instagram posts. Next came newsletters — blogs delivered by
email, essentially — which finally broke the social media hegemony.

</h1>
<p>
For a while I just appended new graphs and data to
<a href="2024-11-25-emacs-china">the last post on this topic</a>. This
time around I feel it’s worse. There are so many bots that I can’t even
do the WHOIS lookup any more. Or perhaps I just managed to block so few
that I never realized how many more there were. In any case, now that
I’m speeding things up, there are more bots to block.
</p>
<p>
<strong>If you want to partake in unsupervised banning with no feedback,
no due process, just automatic ban-hammers, take a look at this script
full of firewall commands.</strong>
</p>
<p>
It needs ipset and iptables access:
<a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a>.
</p>
<p>
I blocked another 4669 networks.
</p>
<p>
What I did was get the most recent 10000 lines from the Apache access
log, filter out all the requests for my GoToSocial instance (hoping that
it has good defences!?), grepping for the magic word,
<a href="/admin/network-lookup-lean">doing reverse lookups</a> using
<code>asn.routeviews.org</code> and banning them all. Looking at a
summary, there were two networks with 6 requests, 6 networks with 5
requests, etc. Of the 4669 networks banned, there were 3985 networks
with a single request only.
</p>
<p>
That is to say, the network lookup is not really all that efficient
because the requests are so incredibly diverse. There are essentially no
individual IP numbers to ban because there are no repeat offenders, and
even with that great ban-hammer of mine, this wouldn’t help against the
next 85% of requests because they are all unique.
</p>
<p>
Now, I was already banning about 10,000 networks yesterday, and their
success rate is still 85%! So that tells you that even this little
jousting I’m doing is tilting at windmills because these bots are
turning the web to shit.
</p>
<p>
Summing the numbers I see that I looked at 10,000 requests, discarded
all the hits for my GoToSocial instance and still had 5560 bot hits.
</p>
<p>
Every website everywhere is paying the distributed price for these
leeches to keep their projects running. Of course, I could rent a bigger
machine, run a bigger cache, spending more money and more time for their
scam.
</p>
<p>
I keep shouting “CO₂ for the CO₂ god!” and that’s part of it, yes…
Sadly!
</p>
<p>
Oh, and I could not post this on fedi because my GoToSocial instance is
unable to cope and takes a very long time to recover from the onslaught.
While I waited, I banned another 2184 networks. And I kept doing it.
</p>
<p>
Fuck this shit.
</p>
<p>
Fuck this whole generation.
</p>
<p>
Time passes.
</p>
<p>
Let me count how many entries I added today.
</p>
<pre><code>awk 'BEGIN {c=0; n=0} /^# 2025-01-23/ {c=1} c&amp;&amp;/^ipset/ {n++} END {print n}' \
  bin/admin/ban-cidr
14497
</code></pre>
<p>
I think it’s about time to add some fail2ban code. If only I knew how.
More cost they are putting on every single site operator and service
provider out there.
</p>
<p>
Right now load is below 4, so that’s not too bad for 2 cores. The sites
are still sluggish. I some sort of congestion issue.

<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23ButlerianJihad">#ButlerianJihad</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-01-24</strong>. What I did all day, yesterday:
</p>
<pre><code># prefix with a timestamp
date; tail -n 2000 /var/log/apache2/access.log \
 | grep -v ^social \
 | grep &quot;rcidonly&quot; \
 | bin/admin/network-lookup-lean &gt; result.log
# count
grep ipset result.log|wc -l
# add
grep ipset result.log|sh
# document
grep ipset result.log&gt;&gt;bin/admin/ban-cidr
</code></pre>
<p>
But today:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-01-23-bots-devouring-the-web-2.jpg" alt="After midnight, load climbed up to 40 and stayed up there" />
</p>
<p>
I think made a mistake, yesterday around midnight. I rebooted the server
and didn’t run the script! 😱
</p>
<p>
I thought the packages <code>netfilter-persistent</code>,
<code>iptables-persistent</code> and <code>ipset-persistent</code> took
care of that but that is not the case. See below for more.
</p>
<p>
In any case, I think the graphs above illustrates what happens to my
server without the firewall rules.
</p>
<p>
Grrr.
</p>
<p>
They said we’re running out of IPv4 numbers but now that I’m trying to
block bots descending like flesh flies on baby bison, it turns out that
there are still thousands of networks that need blocking. Holy cow may
Baal eat the eyes of all the engineers partaking in this scouring of the
web; may all the project managers rot and lose their teeth, their nails,
their hair and their sense of smell; let them all suffer these curses
until they repent, until they mend their ways and help undo the damage
they are wreaking.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Later that day</strong>. I got an email asking about the bots
and so I looked at the last run. Let’s take the last run:
</p>
<pre><code>$ head result.log
Made 763 DNS requests.
21 cache hits.
Range                          |       Hits |
------------------------------:|-----------:|
                       unknown |          4 |
                38.188.60.0/24 |          3 |
                201.46.36.0/22 |          3 |
                45.225.53.0/24 |          2 |
              170.246.119.0/24 |          2 |
               45.178.110.0/23 |          2 |
</code></pre>
<p>
The top hitting network I blocked in the last run had made just
<em>three</em> suspicious requests!
</p>
<p>
There is more info below:
</p>
<pre><code>38.188.60.0/24
38.188.60.92 38.188.60.70 38.188.60.70
38.188.60.0/24 | 38.188.60.92 | 24/Jan/2025:11:57:58 +0100 | GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;days=3&amp;rcidonly=Comments_on_VimMode&amp;showedit=0 HTTP/1.1 | Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/88.0.4324.150 Safari/537.36
38.188.60.0/24 | 38.188.60.70 | 24/Jan/2025:11:58:47 +0100 | GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;from=1730419325&amp;rcidonly=profh&amp;showedit=1 HTTP/1.1 | Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/73.0.3683.86 Safari/537.36
38.188.60.0/24 | 38.188.60.70 | 24/Jan/2025:12:01:02 +0100 | GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;days=3&amp;rcidonly=2013-11-08&amp;showedit=1 HTTP/1.1 | Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/100.0.3478.83 Safari/537.36
ipset add banlist 38.188.60.0/24
</code></pre>
<p>
So the three requests from this network came from just two different IP
numbers:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
38.188.60.92
</li>
<li>
38.188.60.70
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The first suspicious request is for a list of recent changes made in the
last 3 days for the page “Comments on VimMode”.
</p>
<p>
Let’s check whether this is a false positive. Perhaps the request
belongs into a sequence that makes sense to a human?
</p>
<pre><code>$ grep 38.188.60.92 /var/log/apache2/access.log /var/log/apache2/access.log.1 
/var/log/apache2/access.log:www.emacswiki.org:443 38.188.60.92 - - [24/Jan/2025:11:57:58 +0100] &quot;GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;days=3&amp;rcidonly=Comments_on_VimMode&amp;showedit=0 HTTP/1.1&quot; 503 3868 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/88.0.4324.150 Safari/537.36&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>
This strange request is the only request this IP number made in over
24h.
</p>
<p>
The only explanation I have is that the URL belongs to a dataset used to
train AI, using bots running from machines rented all around the world.
Or it’s a denial of service attack.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-01-25</strong>. I think I finally understand the packages
about making it all persistent:
</p>
<p>
<code>netfilter-persistent</code> calls all the modules.
</p>
<p>
<code>iptables-persistent</code> is the module that saves
<code>/etc/iptables/rules.v4</code> and
<code>/etc/iptables/rules.v6</code> with just the rules.
</p>
<p>
<code>ipset-persistent</code> is the module that saves
<code>/etc/iptables/ipsets</code>. This file is about 1MB and pretty
much contains what <code>ban-cidr</code> contains.
</p>
<p>
And as it turns out, saving is never automatic.
</p>
<p>
You need to run <code>netfilter-persistent save</code> manually after
running <code>ban-cidr</code> for all the rules and sets to be loaded on
a reboot.

<p>
For now, I keep returning a 410 “Gone” response to self-identified bots
and I just drop packets from networks that have hosted bots at the
firewall. There are probably problems with this system as packets from
fediverse instances hosted by the same providers get cut off, too. And
I’m not expiring the bans, unfortunately.

a book in French about inclusive language. I liked the blurb very much.
Like Portuguese, the language has a rule that if a group of people is
all women, use female forms, but if there just one man, no matter how
many women there are, use male forms. The blurb says how this pushes
women out of the public sphere because they are no longer perceived as
doing anything. And the blurb says that the speakers of a language have
a choice! We can change, and our language can change. It belongs to the
speakers who are alive now, not to the dead of the past.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
En 1647, Claude Favre de Vaugelas, l’un des premiers membres de
l’Académie française, écrit que « le genre masculin, étant le plus
noble, doit prédominer toutes les fois que le masculin et le féminin se
trouvent ensemble ». Une opinion partagée par d’innombrables penseurs
des XVIIe et XVIIIe siècle qui envoie balancer la croyance populaire
selon laquelle le masculin l’emporte sur le féminin parce qu’il est
générique, neutre ou universel. Le féminin grammatical, ainsi que les
formes féminines des noms de métiers, ont été sciemment éclipsées pour
pousser les femmes hors de la sphère publique, pour les empêcher de se
nommer, peut-être même de se penser. … Mais les francophones n’ont pas
dit leur dernier mot! Les multiples stratégies d’écriture inclusive déjà
répandues témoignent de la révolution langagière que nous connaissons et
qui défonce les barrières artificielles érigées par les académiciens. …
Cet ouvrage sert d’introduction à l’écriture inclusive, de traité
d’histoire sur l’influence du sexisme sur la langue, mais surtout de
formidable outil pour quiconque cherche à écrire en ne laissant personne
dans l’ombre. –

<p>
This is a bit related to discussions around the other languages I speak:
Is German German more German than Swiss or Austrian German? Is
Continental Portuguese more Portuguese than Brazilian Portuguese? Is
English English more English than Indian English or Irish English? No!
The language belongs to those who speak it.

Hickey wrote</a> something I wholeheartedly agree with. “If you think
the day job might literally kill you, and you have no kids, quit and try
that mad idea. That might also kill you, but better to die trying
something wonderful than be killed by a crappy job.”

<p>
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lgxod4czuc2o">My
response</a>: “My life story since I was 22, and I’m 69 now. It’s worked
out okay, not perfect, I have regrets, but I would have far more if I
hadn’t bet on myself. My 22-year-old self was very right about a lot of
things.”

It’s set in, like, a socialist colony on an alien planet, with lots of
gender &amp; sexual diversity and even polyamorous representation (hell
yes!). But also, it’s a time loop game – you’re supposed to play through
it more than once, using the knowledge your character gains each run to
make better choices the next time around. I finished my first run today
(which took me 11.4 hours over four days… hooked, I have been) and I’m
really excited to play the next one. It also has a beautiful art style
and great soundtrack!
</p>
<p>
The only thing is, while I was trying to avoid spoilers (which I usually
never do! Usually I’m like “gimme that walkthrough” but with this one I
wanted to experience it first) I did read a lot of reviews that were
like, “You’re basically doomed to a bad ending on your first run,” but I
became… a teacher. And because I had a rebellion score of 100/100, I
became the best kind of teacher who teaches the kids to “question
everything”. I mean, there had been a lot of tragic deaths in the first
half of my run, but the ending itself didn’t really seem bad. Maybe what
people meant is that the ending didn’t magically undo the tragic deaths,
idk. I did see one review which was like, “this game is the worst, it
didn’t warn me I needed at least one skill at 100/100 by the end of the
game” but I had like… five skills at 100/100; this was not a high bar to
clear. I have <em>now</em> looked up the list of possible endings and
honestly, I don’t even know what you get if you didn’t have any skills
at 100…
</p>
<p>
Oh yeah, and then the <em>other</em> thing was that the character I’d
been trying to romance fuckin’ <span class="spoiler">planted a bomb and
peaced out for the last year or something of the game. Disappeared,
never to be seen again</span>. So I guess I have an idea for what I want
to focus on next time.

New York <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Hernandez">had</a>

Albert Shanker with a nuclear weapon kind of fit his character as a bomb
throwing type in city politics in an extreme way. A fitting and comic
way for us to end it all. Proof that god has a sense of humor. It was an
inside reference only NYers would get. Well in case you didn’t know it,
back in that time or a little later, Trump was one of those Albert
Shanker types. And yes, now again he has all the nuclear weapons. And it
still feels like he’s only famous in a mediocre Queens real estate way.
Isn’t that weird?</p>

<p>We’re programmed to believe big companies make things the right way
and individual people can’t be trusted. We’re going to have to break out
of that rut, to stop trusting them so much. It’s like the 2008 banking
crisis, but this time they’ve taken over the government, not just the
economy. The tech industry, believe it or not, started with assumption
that it was the other way around. That people were the brilliance, and
companies started wars to make money (we were the generation that
stopped the Vietnam war, btw). I got into computers because I thought I
could earn a living that way, but quickly discovered how inherently
subversive they are. They weren’t just for the nerds with the plastic
pocket protectors, they were also for hippies. Some of us are still here
and we want to create with you.</p>

Lobbyist Caught Hacking Climate Activists</h2>

The Department of Justice is investigating a lobbying firm representing
ExxonMobil for

<p>
The hacking was allegedly commissioned by a Washington, D.C., lobbying
firm,

to a lawyer representing the U.S. government</a>. The firm, in turn, was
allegedly working on behalf of one of the world’s largest oil and gas
companies, based in Texas, that wanted to discredit groups and
individuals involved in climate litigation, according to the lawyer for
the U.S. government. In court documents, the Justice Department does not
name either company…

I joined the kickstarter a long time ago and got the device yesterday.
The package was nice. It works. The menu looks good – always tricky with
a wheel user interface. My 16GiB SD card works, all I had to so was
reformat it using a VFAT file-system (whatever the Gnome Disks app
suggested). The device came semi-charged so it worked immediately.
Something rattles when I shake it. Maybe it’s the button? There is some
sort of haptic feedback with the UI which surprised me. The UI doesn’t
dim or go dark with inactivity, there’s a switch to do it. I guess I
like it. The music sounds great with my old Sennheiser Monument
cable-only headphones.

<p>I thought this excerpt from
<a href="https://contrarian.substack.com/p/departing-the-new-york-times">Krugman’s
piece</a> about his move back to blogging was right on. “For a while I
tried to make up for the loss of the blog with threads on Twitter. But
even before Elon Musk Nazified the site, tweet threads were an awkward,
inferior substitute for blog posts.” There’s a need for a system that
combines the full-featured writing of blogging and the timelines of
twitter-like systems.</p>

This might be my favorite song of all time. It’s by a slightly obscure
Chicago punk band called The Broadways, made up of a couple members from
the more well-known ska band Slapstick. It’s got everything you want in
a punk song. Palm mutes, open meedly-meedly parts, yelling, speed, a
half-time breakdown, and impeccable synchronicity. I listen to this song
when I’m sad, when I’m frustrated, when I’m in traffic, and when I need
to inject high octane fuel into my veins. The soaring octave chords will
always pick me back up again.
</p>
<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="markdown">All on the streets, the signs read
Cheaper and better technology
This capitalist vision is my nightmare

Put up a sign in my face
What the fuck happened to this place?
I think we made a wrong turn
Look at the lovely concrete

I drove to my stupid job today
Got stopped at an intersection
Fifteen minutes of my life just rolled away

Looked at the guy next to me
He didn't look too happy
No one's happy, but everyone's too busy to see

Let's go shopping today
Drive our fancy cars to the fancy malls
And for lunch we'll have Big Macs

I wish I could turn the clock back
Back to when I was ten
When I wasn't scared of everything
And everything wasn't so fucking crowded

And I wonder if my kid will ever see the horizon
Untouched by billboards and shopping malls
And I wonder if this crazy world
Thinks I'm the one that's crazy

What if I'm the one who's crazy?
What if I'm the one who's crazy?
What if I'm the one who's crazy?
What if I'm the one who's crazy?
I'm not crazy, just frustrated

<p>
WIthout a doubt, this song from my teenage years subliminally shaped a
lot of my views on what’s wrong with the world. Capitalist intrusions.
Eyeball monetization. The always upgrade tech cycle. Why I hate crowds.
And traffic. Life evaporating at a stop light seems like a criminal
waste of humanity to me. This may subconsciously be part of why I work
from home.
</p>
<p>
I’ll never live up to my punk rock ideals or my teenage self, but this
song takes me back to them. Not to “when I was ten”, but to “when I was
seventeen” for sure. Driving through big city Houston at night. Going to
Food Not Bombs near the abandoned hospital. All it takes is the first
verse and BOOM! I’m transported through time and I can see the world
through my old anarcho-tinted glasses. It makes you want to smash
systems and break concrete.

<h2 id="is-bluesky-billionaire-proof">Is Bluesky billionaire-proof?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Could what
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk">happened</a>
to Twitter, happen there?
</p>
<p>
To determine, ask yourself if you could continue to use it if it was
acquired by a billionaire for their own personal political use?
</p>
<p>
What would you switch to?
</p>
<p>
Would you have to give up your history and followers?
</p>
<p>
And developers, what would you do if the billionaire acquirer dropped
support for the api? How expensive and time consuming would it be to
convert to a different protocol? Would you even bother?
</p>
<p>
We’ve learned a lot from the billionaire acquisition of twitter. The
answer to these questions made a lot of us think we’d never want to do
this again. But despite all the misleading hype, we very much are
repeating the mistakes.
</p>
<p>
The current owners of Bluesky would be crazy if they closed off the
opportunity to get rich. But they shouldn’t be misleading users and
developers into believing that it’s safe to trust this as an open
platform that couldn’t be acquired and have its utility consumed the way
twitter’s was.
</p>
<p>
This started as a
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3lgsgmmhyf22q">thread</a>
on Bluesky of course. :-)
</p>
<p>
PS: Spoiler – Bluesky is, as it is currently configured, not
billionaire-proof. It’s going to get acquired, it probably already has,
based on what they’re doing. Remember, pay attention to what they do,
not what they say. It’s just as true in tech as it is in politics, and
these days, what’s the difference anyway?
</p>
<p>
PPS: If you’re thinking ahh but there’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol">AT Protocol</a>, our
ace in the hole. Please. Twitter had an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter#Technology">API</a> too.
It didn’t make a difference. And AT Proto won’t either unless there are
proven systems that people are actually using that peer with Bluesky’s
servers, so those users can’t be sold to the billionaire. We’re nowhere
near that. No one can say with any certainty that it’s even possible. At
this point the continued support of the API is entirely up to the owners
of Bluesky. They could change it, break developers or completely drop it
and the users and developers would have no recourse.
</p>
<p>
PPPS: Can you imagine the founders of Bluesky wouldn’t take $20 million
each for their share?

There’s a lot of unfinished business. We have made an impact through our
ransomware vulnerability warning pilot and our pre-ransomware
notification initiative, and I’m really proud of that, because we work
on preventing somebody from having their worst day. But ransomware is
still a problem. We have been laser-focused on PRC cyber actors. That
will continue to be a huge problem. I’m really proud of where we are,
but there’s much, much more work to be done. There are things that I
think we can continue driving, that the next administration, I hope,
will look at, because, frankly, cybersecurity is a national security
issue…

<h2 id="rivers-on-bluesky">Rivers on Bluesky</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
This is a post for longtime Scripting News readers. As you know, I’ve
been doing feed readers for a long time. They’ve been mostly organized
around the
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22river%20of%20news%22">river
of news</a> concept, which also happens to be the way twitter-like
systems work. My rivers are built around
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> and formats
that interop with RSS.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/19/basketball.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Then
I got one of the ideas out of the blue that at first didn’t make sense,
but then the more I thought about the better the idea seemed. It came
from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mcuban.bsky.social">Mark
Cuban</a>, who liked one of my posts on Bluesky, it was about some
FeedLand rivers I had produced, and then I did what I often do – I
offered to do something like that for him. For obvious reasons I don’t
need to go into here, you all are smart or you wouldn’t be reading this.
:-)
</p>
<p>
Anyway – he said “I’d use that if it were on Bluesky.”
</p>
<p>
My first thought, ridiculous – can’t be done. They have all these limits
that aren’t present in HTML. I don’t have any idea how I could make this
work. Here’s a
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/01/27/riverInFeedlandScreenshot.png">screen
shot</a> of what a river looks like in FeedLand.
</p>
<p>
But then after a few hours or days, the idea developed, as often
happens, and I decided it might work and was worth a try.
</p>
<p>
So I wrote a piece of software that hooked into FeedLand’s outbound news
flow, and picked out stories from the right feeds, and shot them over to
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/feediverse.bsky.social">an account on
Bluesky</a>. Thanks to
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mcuban.bsky.social">Cuban</a>, who
linked to it from his million+ follower account, it has 7.6K followers.
It uses the list of feeds in my
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=blogroll">blogroll</a>
on Scripting News to feed the river. I think it’s a really good
pioneering effort, with quite a few followers who are active. And it’s
going to stay running for the indefinite future. That was in December.
</p>
<p>
Now I’ve gone a step further, and generalized the code so I can have N
of these rivers instead of just one. And to prove it works, I now have
two new rivers on Bluesky.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dave.feediverse.org">dave.feediverse.org</a>
– the <a href="https://news.scripting.com/?tab=dave">Dave tab</a> on my
news site. It subscribes to all the RSS feeds I generate. My linkblog,
Scripting News, even my YouTube channel which has an RSS feed. Chuck
Shotton requested this. It was a good idea so it was the
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dave.feediverse.org">first new
river</a> I did on Bluesky. Went on the air just yesterday and now has
10 followers.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nba.feediverse.org">nba.feediverse.org</a>
– then my project for this morning is to do the same thing for the NBA.
I’m a huge Knicks fan, and basically love all of the NBA. People say the
Knicks must win a championship, but I say who cares. If they keep
playing at this level, with new castmembers all the time, with the track
record of current management, I’m a totally happy campter. If we won a
championship all the more exciting, but after all those years in the
wilderness, it’s so nice to finally after all this time to have a great
NBA team in NY (and sorry the Nets don’t count). Anyway, there’s nothing
more really to say. If you like basketball, and use Bluesky –
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nba.feediverse.org">here’s</a> what
you follow.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
One more thing – no federation here folks. It’s very simple. No new
formats or protocols, built entirely on the tried-and-true RSS and OPML
formats for feeds and subscription lists. (And of course support for
Atom and RDF too.)
</p>
<p>
I’m glad Mark Cuban asked me to try this path, it provides something I
hadn’t thought of. Not just inbound feeds for Bluesky, inbound rivers.
All we need now is Markdown support, and then a
<a href="https://textcasting.org/">few more things</a>, and we’ll be
back to where we were in 1997. :-)

<h2 id="what-is-a-sanctuary-city">What is a sanctuary city?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I wonder if people understand what a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary_city">sanctuary
city</a> is.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
In a sanctuary city the local government accepts the fact that there are
people living in the city who are not there legally.
</li>
<li>
They want these people to be able to call the police without fear of
being turned into the feds. Otherwise crime would go unreported and that
would create much larger problems.
</li>
<li>
They want the children of these people, who are often American citizens,
to be able to go to school, again without having the parents reported to
the feds. If they didn’t guarantee that, the kids wouldn’t be in school,
and we all lose by having uneducated adults. It’s a core principle of
this country that educated citizens are a good thing.
</li>
<li>
They want them to be able to get health care, to go to a hospital when
someone is seriously ill or injured. This is partly for pragmatic
reasons, to slow disease spreading, and also because we are a rich
country and keeping people healthy is a good thing, just like education.
What other purpose could a government have? (A fair question for
Republicans, one they probably wouldn’t want to answer truthfully.)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Republican talking points make it sound like local governments that
declare as sanctuary cities are weak or immoral or anti-American, but
that is not what’s going on. You couldn’t run a city with huge crimes
commited against illegals because they would be so vulnerable, and kids
need education, and everyone needs health care. Yet I hear the word used
all the time in public discourse, and am concerned that most people
don’t know what it means.

<p>
A newly discovered
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/backdoor-infecting-vpns-used-magic-packets-for-stealth-and-security/">VPN
backdoor</a> uses some interesting tactics to avoid detection:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
When threat actors use backdoor malware to gain access to a network,
they want to make sure all their hard work can’t be leveraged by
competing groups or detected by defenders. One countermeasure is to
equip the backdoor with a passive agent that remains dormant until it
receives what’s known in the business as a “magic packet.” On Thursday,
researchers revealed that a never-before-seen backdoor that quietly took
hold of dozens of enterprise VPNs running Juniper Network’s Junos OS has
been doing just that…

<h2 id="a-story-about-pans">A story about pans</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-26, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
The other day I sent my wife a link to
<a href="https://madeincookware.com/products/ceramic-frying-pan/set">a
new set of ceramic pans</a> and asked, “What do you think?” assuming
she’d be as impressed as I was of the picture of eggs sliding off the
pan. Her response: a grimace. Using my sixteen years of husbandly
intuition, I surmised that we were not on the same page about
kitchenware.
</p>
<p>
For context, my wife has had the same stainless steel pans that her
parents bought her since we met. They’ve outlasted the fancier non-stick
pans we’ve auditioned. Her opinion of the pans is that they’re
high-quality because they’ve lasted so long and still work. And from
that perspective she’s right, they technically still work… but not
without some downsides.
</p>
<p>
When you use stainless steel pans instead of non-stick pans, you’re
committing to stickiness and having a harder time cleaning your pans. I
can accept that as an incurred cost. I think my bigger issue is that ALL
our pans do this. Even our cast irons which we’ve made thousands of
batches of bacon with but still aren’t seasoned. If you make scrambled
eggs, about two eggs worth of material forms a brown sheet of crust on
the bottom of the pan that I must scrape off but NOT using soap per the
laws of properly seasoning a cast iron pan.
</p>
<p>
Anyways, my wife and I aren’t seeing eye-to-eye on the pans and I’m kind
of struggling to see why. I think there’s some frugalness afoot and
possibly some sentimental attachment to items that were gifts. And then
she –with her Deanna Troi, betazoid-levels of empathy– said “You
probably think we need new ones because you do the dishes” and that was
our ah-ha moment!
</p>
<p>
In our house I’m the self-appointed dish-master because I can hyperfocus
on them while listening to an audiobook, pairing something I don’t like
with something I do like. My perspective on the pans is that they’re a
lot of work to clean up every night. Scraping and scrubbing the charred
chunky bits off so we can ruin them the next day. Essentially, I operate
at a different end of the “stack” of dishes than she does so we see the
situation differently. I have bigger feelings about the stickiness of
the pans because that’s the part that I interface with the most. I would
like to apply non-stick technology to improve the dish-washing process.
Where she sees something that works okay and we’ve had for a long time,
while I see a maintenance burden.
</p>
<p>
Now we have an end-to-end/cross-team perspective of our pans and that is
valuable. We understand each other’s needs on a micro-level (the pans
are too sticky) and the macro-level (one side of the stack inherits more
burden with our pan choice) and that’s helpful for framing future
conversations about pans. That said, I don’t think we’re getting new
pans any time soon. Such is life. Not all decisions are technical ones.
