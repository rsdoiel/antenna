Hickey wrote</a> something I wholeheartedly agree with. “If you think
the day job might literally kill you, and you have no kids, quit and try
that mad idea. That might also kill you, but better to die trying
something wonderful than be killed by a crappy job.”

<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lgxod4czuc2o">My
response</a>: “My life story since i was 22, and I’m 69 now. It’s worked
out okay, not perfect, I have regrets, but I would have far more if I
hadn’t bet on myself. My 22-year-old self was very right about a lot of
things.”

It’s set in, like, a socialist colony on an alien planet, with lots of
gender &amp; sexual diversity and even polyamorous representation (hell
yes!). But also, it’s a time loop game – you’re supposed to play through
it more than once, using the knowledge your character gains each run to
make better choices the next time around. I finished my first run today
(which took me 11.4 hours over four days… hooked, I have been) and I’m
really excited to play the next one. It also has a beautiful art style
and great soundtrack!
</p>
<p>
The only thing is, while I was trying to avoid spoilers (which I usually
never do! Usually I’m like “gimme that walkthrough” but with this one I
wanted to experience it first) I did read a lot of reviews that were
like, “You’re basically doomed to a bad ending on your first run,” but I
became… a teacher. And because I had a rebellion score of 100/100, I
became the best kind of teacher who teaches the kids to “question
everything”. I mean, there had been a lot of tragic deaths in the first
half of my run, but the ending itself didn’t really seem bad. Maybe what
people meant is that the ending didn’t magically undo the tragic deaths,
idk. I did see one review which was like, “this game is the worst, it
didn’t warn me I needed at least one skill at 100/100 by the end of the
game” but I had like… five skills at 100/100; this was not a high bar to
clear. I have <em>now</em> looked up the list of possible endings and
honestly, I don’t even know what you get if you didn’t have any skills
at 100…
</p>
<p>
Oh yeah, and then the <em>other</em> thing was that the character I’d
been trying to romance fuckin’ <span class="spoiler">planted a bomb and
peaced out for the last year or something of the game. Disappeared,
never to be seen again</span>. So I guess I have an idea for what I want
to focus on next time.

more thing then I have to get back to work. There’s a great moment in
Woody Allen’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeper_(1973_film)">Sleeper</a>
where a time traveler was told that the world was destroyed when
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2fYguIX17Q&t=130s">Albert
Shanker</a> got hold of a nuclear warhead. If you lived in NYC in the
70s and 80s you knew
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Shanker">Albert
Shanker</a> as a NY character like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Sharpton">Al Sharpton</a> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Sliwa">Curtis Sliwa</a>.
New York <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Hernandez">had</a>
its own semi-celebrities,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani">people</a> who
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Morrow">were</a> famous
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Breslin">mostly</a> in New
York, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bella_Abzug">but</a> not
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Koch">as</a> much
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lindsay">outside</a>. So
Albert Shanker with a nuclear weapon kind of fit his character as a bomb
throwing type in city politics in an extreme way. A fitting and comic
way for us to end it all. Proof that god has a sense of humor. It was an
inside reference only NYers would get. Well in case you didn’t know it,
back in that time or a little later, Trump was one of those Albert
Shanker types. And yes, now again he has all the nuclear weapons. And it
still feels like he’s only famous in a mediocre Queens real estate way.
Isn’t that weird?</p>

<p>We’re programmed to believe big companies make things the right way
and individual people can’t be trusted. We’re going to have to break out
of that rut, to stop trusting them so much. It’s like the 2008 banking
crisis, but this time they’ve taken over the government, not just the
economy. The tech industry, believe it or not, started with assumption
that it was the other way around. That people were the brilliance, and
companies started wars to make money (we were the generation that
stopped the Vietnam war, btw). I got into computers because I thought I
could earn a living that way, but quickly discovered how inherently
subversive they are. They weren’t just for the nerds with the plastic
pocket protectors, they were also for hippies. Some of us are still here
and we want to create with you.</p>

<p>
The hacking was allegedly commissioned by a Washington, D.C., lobbying
firm,

to a lawyer representing the U.S. government</a>. The firm, in turn, was
allegedly working on behalf of one of the world’s largest oil and gas
companies, based in Texas, that wanted to discredit groups and
individuals involved in climate litigation, according to the lawyer for
the U.S. government. In court documents, the Justice Department does not

I joined the kickstarter a long time ago and got the device yesterday.
The package was nice. It works. The menu looks good – always tricky with
a wheel user interface. My 16GiB SD card works, all I had to so was
reformat it using a VFAT file-system (whatever the Gnome Disks app
suggested). The device came semi-charged so it worked immediately.
Something rattles when I shake it. Maybe it’s the button? There is some
sort of haptic feedback with the UI which surprised me. The UI doesn’t
dim or go dark with inactivity, there’s a switch to do it. I guess I
like it. The music sounds great with my old Sennheiser Monument
cable-only headphones.

<p>I thought this excerpt from
<a href="https://contrarian.substack.com/p/departing-the-new-york-times">Krugman’s
piece</a> about his move back to blogging was right on. “For a while I
tried to make up for the loss of the blog with threads on Twitter. But
even before Elon Musk Nazified the site, tweet threads were an awkward,
inferior substitute for blog posts.” There’s a need for a system that
combines the full-featured writing of blogging and the timelines of
twitter-like systems.</p>

<h1 id="2025-01-27-using-rsync-with-sqlite-databases">
2025-01-27 Using rsync with Sqlite databases
</h1>
<p>
I use Debian stable so my copy of Sqlite is not the latest and greatest.
At the same time, I don’t use Borg Backup for my server. I use rsync.
</p>
<p>
I copy the content of the important server files to my local laptop and
then I make a backup of my laptop to external disks using Borg Backup.
</p>
<p>
When making copies using rsync, the database must not be in use.
Otherwise, a busy database is probably going to be corrupt when
restoring it from backup.
</p>
<p>
The key is to stop the program using the database before beginning the
backup and starting it after the backup. It’s also important to stop the
program using the monitoring software. I use Monit to monitor the
server. If I don’t stop GoToSocial using Monit, Monit will discover that
GoToSocial isn’t running and start it while rsync is still copying the
database file. The database file is 10G so copying it takes a long time.
Long enough for Monit to discover that GoToSocial isn’t running.
</p>
<p>
I should stop and start other programs, too: The Lounge, Norn, etc.
</p>
<p>
This is my script:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

# sibirocobombus.root is defined in ~/.ssh/config

# Using sudo rsync --archive to preserve ownership.
# Using --fake-super to avoid changes to groups and owners

echo Backing up Sibirocobombus

This might be my favorite song of all time. It’s by a slightly obscure
Chicago punk band called The Broadways, made up of a couple members from
the more well-known ska band Slapstick. It’s got everything you want in
a punk song. Palm mutes, open meedly-meedly parts, yelling, speed, a
half-time breakdown, and impeccable synchronicity. I listen to this song
when I’m sad, when I’m frustrated, when I’m in traffic, and when I need
to inject high octane fuel into my veins. The soaring octave chords will
always pick me back up again.
</p>
<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="markdown">All on the streets, the signs read
Cheaper and better technology
This capitalist vision is my nightmare

Put up a sign in my face
What the fuck happened to this place?
I think we made a wrong turn
Look at the lovely concrete

I drove to my stupid job today
Got stopped at an intersection
Fifteen minutes of my life just rolled away

Looked at the guy next to me
He didn't look too happy
No one's happy, but everyone's too busy to see

Let's go shopping today
Drive our fancy cars to the fancy malls
And for lunch we'll have Big Macs

I wish I could turn the clock back
Back to when I was ten
When I wasn't scared of everything
And everything wasn't so fucking crowded

And I wonder if my kid will ever see the horizon
Untouched by billboards and shopping malls
And I wonder if this crazy world
Thinks I'm the one that's crazy

What if I'm the one who's crazy?
What if I'm the one who's crazy?
What if I'm the one who's crazy?
What if I'm the one who's crazy?
I'm not crazy, just frustrated
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
WIthout a doubt, this song from my teenage years subliminally shaped a
lot of my views on what’s wrong with the world. Capitalist intrusions.
Eyeball monetization. The always upgrade tech cycle. Why I hate crowds.
And traffic. Life evaporating at a stop light seems like a criminal
waste of humanity to me. This may subconsciously be part of why I work
from home.
</p>
<p>
I’ll never live up to my punk rock ideals or my teenage self, but this
song takes me back to them. Not to “when I was ten”, but to “when I was
seventeen” for sure. Driving through big city Houston at night. Going to
Food Not Bombs near the abandoned hospital. All it takes is the first
verse and BOOM! I’m transported through time and I can see the world
through my old anarcho-tinted glasses. It makes you want to smash
systems and break concrete.

<h2 id="is-bluesky-billionaire-proof">Is Bluesky billionaire-proof?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Could what
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk">happened</a>
to Twitter, happen there?
</p>
<p>
To determine, ask yourself if you could continue to use it if it was
acquired by a billionaire for their own personal political use?
</p>
<p>
What would you switch to?
</p>
<p>
Would you have to give up your history and followers?
</p>
<p>
And developers, what would you do if the billionaire acquirer dropped
support for the api? How expensive and time consuming would it be to
convert to a different protocol? Would you even bother?
</p>
<p>
We’ve learned a lot from the billionaire acquisition of twitter. The
answer to these questions made a lot of us think we’d never want to do
this again. But despite all the misleading hype, we very much are
repeating the mistakes.
</p>
<p>
The current owners of Bluesky would be crazy if they closed off the
opportunity to get rich. But they shouldn’t be misleading users and
developers into believing that it’s safe to trust this as an open
platform that couldn’t be acquired and have its utility consumed the way
twitter’s was.
</p>
<p>
This started as a
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3lgsgmmhyf22q">thread</a>
on Bluesky of course. :-)
</p>
<p>
PS: Spoiler – Bluesky is, as it is currently configured, not
billionaire-proof. It’s going to get acquired, it probably already has,
based on what they’re doing. Remember, pay attention to what they do,
not what they say. It’s just as true in tech as it is in politics, and
these days, what’s the difference anyway?
</p>
<p>
PPS: If you’re thinking ahh but there’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol">AT Protocol</a>, our
ace in the hole. Please. Twitter had an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter#Technology">API</a> too.
It didn’t make a difference. And AT Proto won’t either unless there are
proven systems that people are actually using that peer with Bluesky’s
servers, so those users can’t be sold to the billionaire. We’re nowhere
near that. No one can say with any certainty that it’s even possible. At
this point the continued support of the API is entirely up to the owners
of Bluesky. They could change it, break developers or completely drop it
and the users and developers would have no recourse.
</p>
<p>
PPPS: Can you imagine the founders of Bluesky wouldn’t take $20 million
each for their share?

<p>
There’s a lot of unfinished business. We have made an impact through our
ransomware vulnerability warning pilot and our pre-ransomware
notification initiative, and I’m really proud of that, because we work
on preventing somebody from having their worst day. But ransomware is
still a problem. We have been laser-focused on PRC cyber actors. That
will continue to be a huge problem. I’m really proud of where we are,
but there’s much, much more work to be done. There are things that I
think we can continue driving, that the next administration, I hope,
will look at, because, frankly, cybersecurity is a national security
issue…

<h2 id="rivers-on-bluesky">Rivers on Bluesky</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
This is a post for longtime Scripting News readers. As you know, I’ve
been doing feed readers for a long time. They’ve been mostly organized
around the
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22river%20of%20news%22">river
of news</a> concept, which also happens to be the way twitter-like
systems work. My rivers are built around
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> and formats
that interop with RSS.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/19/basketball.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Then
I got one of the ideas out of the blue that at first didn’t make sense,
but then the more I thought about the better the idea seemed. It came
from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mcuban.bsky.social">Mark
Cuban</a>, who liked one of my posts on Bluesky, it was about some
FeedLand rivers I had produced, and then I did what I often do – I
offered to do something like that for him. For obvious reasons I don’t
need to go into here, you all are smart or you wouldn’t be reading this.
:-)
</p>
<p>
Anyway – he said “I’d use that if it were on Bluesky.”
</p>
<p>
My first thought, ridiculous – can’t be done. They have all these limits
that aren’t present in HTML. I don’t have any idea how I could make this
work. Here’s a
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/01/27/riverInFeedlandScreenshot.png">screen
shot</a> of what a river looks like in FeedLand.
</p>
<p>
But then after a few hours or days, the idea developed, as often
happens, and I decided it might work and was worth a try.
</p>
<p>
So I wrote a piece of software that hooked into FeedLand’s outbound news
flow, and picked out stories from the right feeds, and shot them over to
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/feediverse.bsky.social">an account on
Bluesky</a>. Thanks to
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mcuban.bsky.social">Cuban</a>, who
linked to it from his million+ follower account, it has 7.6K followers.
It uses the list of feeds in my
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=blogroll">blogroll</a>
on Scripting News to feed the river. I think it’s a really good
pioneering effort, with quite a few followers who are active. And it’s
going to stay running for the indefinite future. That was in December.
</p>
<p>
Now I’ve gone a step further, and generalized the code so I can have N
of these rivers instead of just one. And to prove it works, I now have
two new rivers on Bluesky.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dave.feediverse.org">dave.feediverse.org</a>
– the <a href="https://news.scripting.com/?tab=dave">Dave tab</a> on my
news site. It subscribes to all the RSS feeds I generate. My linkblog,
Scripting News, even my YouTube channel which has an RSS feed. Chuck
Shotton requested this. It was a good idea so it was the
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dave.feediverse.org">first new
river</a> I did on Bluesky. Went on the air just yesterday and now has
10 followers.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nba.feediverse.org">nba.feediverse.org</a>
– then my project for this morning is to do the same thing for the NBA.
I’m a huge Knicks fan, and basically love all of the NBA. People say the
Knicks must win a championship, but I say who cares. If they keep
playing at this level, with new castmembers all the time, with the track
record of current management, I’m a totally happy campter. If we won a
championship all the more exciting, but after all those years in the
wilderness, it’s so nice to finally after all this time to have a great
NBA team in NY (and sorry the Nets don’t count). Anyway, there’s nothing
more really to say. If you like basketball, and use Bluesky –
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nba.feediverse.org">here’s</a> what
you follow.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
One more thing – no federation here folks. It’s very simple. No new
formats or protocols, built entirely on the tried-and-true RSS and OPML
formats for feeds and subscription lists. (And of course support for
Atom and RDF too.)
</p>
<p>
I’m glad Mark Cuban asked me to try this path, it provides something I
hadn’t thought of. Not just inbound feeds for Bluesky, inbound rivers.
All we need now is Markdown support, and then a
<a href="https://textcasting.org/">few more things</a>, and we’ll be
back to where we were in 1997. :-)

<h2 id="what-is-a-sanctuary-city">What is a sanctuary city?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I wonder if people understand what a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary_city">sanctuary
city</a> is.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
In a sanctuary city the local government accepts the fact that there are
people living in the city who are not there legally.
</li>
<li>
They want these people to be able to call the police without fear of
being turned into the feds. Otherwise crime would go unreported and that
would create much larger problems.
</li>
<li>
They want the children of these people, who are often American citizens,
to be able to go to school, again without having the parents reported to
the feds. If they didn’t guarantee that, the kids wouldn’t be in school,
and we all lose by having uneducated adults. It’s a core principle of
this country that educated citizens are a good thing.
</li>
<li>
They want them to be able to get health care, to go to a hospital when
someone is seriously ill or injured. This is partly for pragmatic
reasons, to slow disease spreading, and also because we are a rich
country and keeping people healthy is a good thing, just like education.
What other purpose could a government have? (A fair question for
Republicans, one they probably wouldn’t want to answer truthfully.)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Republican talking points make it sound like local governments that
declare as sanctuary cities are weak or immoral or anti-American, but
that is not what’s going on. You couldn’t run a city with huge crimes
commited against illegals because they would be so vulnerable, and kids
need education, and everyone needs health care. Yet I hear the word used
all the time in public discourse, and am concerned that most people
don’t know what it means.

<p>date: 2025-01-27, updated: 2025-01-25, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
A newly discovered
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/backdoor-infecting-vpns-used-magic-packets-for-stealth-and-security/">VPN
backdoor</a> uses some interesting tactics to avoid detection:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
When threat actors use backdoor malware to gain access to a network,
they want to make sure all their hard work can’t be leveraged by
competing groups or detected by defenders. One countermeasure is to
equip the backdoor with a passive agent that remains dormant until it
receives what’s known in the business as a “magic packet.” On Thursday,
researchers revealed that a never-before-seen backdoor that quietly took
hold of dozens of enterprise VPNs running Juniper Network’s Junos OS has
been doing just that…

<p>I re-read a book I first read in 2002 when the first UK paperback was
published, Louis Menand’s magnificent The Metaphysical Club: A story of
ideas in America. It takes a sweeping view of the reshaping of the
climate of …

<h2 id="a-story-about-pans">A story about pans</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-26, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
The other day I sent my wife a link to
<a href="https://madeincookware.com/products/ceramic-frying-pan/set">a
new set of ceramic pans</a> and asked, “What do you think?” assuming
she’d be as impressed as I was of the picture of eggs sliding off the
pan. Her response: a grimace. Using my sixteen years of husbandly
intuition, I surmised that we were not on the same page about
kitchenware.
</p>
<p>
For context, my wife has had the same stainless steel pans that her
parents bought her since we met. They’ve outlasted the fancier non-stick
pans we’ve auditioned. Her opinion of the pans is that they’re
high-quality because they’ve lasted so long and still work. And from
that perspective she’s right, they technically still work… but not
without some downsides.
</p>
<p>
When you use stainless steel pans instead of non-stick pans, you’re
committing to stickiness and having a harder time cleaning your pans. I
can accept that as an incurred cost. I think my bigger issue is that ALL
our pans do this. Even our cast irons which we’ve made thousands of
batches of bacon with but still aren’t seasoned. If you make scrambled
eggs, about two eggs worth of material forms a brown sheet of crust on
the bottom of the pan that I must scrape off but NOT using soap per the
laws of properly seasoning a cast iron pan.
</p>
<p>
Anyways, my wife and I aren’t seeing eye-to-eye on the pans and I’m kind
of struggling to see why. I think there’s some frugalness afoot and
possibly some sentimental attachment to items that were gifts. And then
she –with her Deanna Troi, betazoid-levels of empathy– said “You
probably think we need new ones because you do the dishes” and that was
our ah-ha moment!
</p>
<p>
In our house I’m the self-appointed dish-master because I can hyperfocus
on them while listening to an audiobook, pairing something I don’t like
with something I do like. My perspective on the pans is that they’re a
lot of work to clean up every night. Scraping and scrubbing the charred
chunky bits off so we can ruin them the next day. Essentially, I operate
at a different end of the “stack” of dishes than she does so we see the
situation differently. I have bigger feelings about the stickiness of
the pans because that’s the part that I interface with the most. I would
like to apply non-stick technology to improve the dish-washing process.
Where she sees something that works okay and we’ve had for a long time,
while I see a maintenance burden.
</p>
<p>
Now we have an end-to-end/cross-team perspective of our pans and that is
valuable. We understand each other’s needs on a micro-level (the pans
are too sticky) and the macro-level (one side of the stack inherits more
burden with our pan choice) and that’s helpful for framing future
conversations about pans. That said, I don’t think we’re getting new
pans any time soon. Such is life. Not all decisions are technical ones.
