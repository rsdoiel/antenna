I‚Äôve been posting extracts every now on then on fedi.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Sabotage varies from highly technical <em>coup de main</em> acts that
require detailed planning and the use of specially trained operatives,
to innumerable simple acts which the ordinary individual
citizen-saboteur can perform. This paper is primarily concerned with the
latter type. Simple sabotage does not require specially prepared tools
or equipment; it is executed by an ordinary citizen who may or may not
act individually and without the necessity for active connection with an
organized group; and it is carried out in such a way as to involve a
minimum danger of injury, detection, and reprisal. ‚Äì
<a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Simple_Sabotage_Field_Manual/Introduction">OSS
Simple Sabotage Manual, Introduction</a>

</blockquote>
<p>
It think it is important to place a premium on minimizing the dangers.
There‚Äôs no point in becoming a casualty in the fight against fascism.
There‚Äôs no point in losing your job or your life to a fascist.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A second type of simple sabotage requires no destructive tools
whatsoever and produces physical damage, if any, by highly indirect
means. It is based on universal opportunities to make faulty decisions,
to adopt a non-cooperative attitude, and to induce others to follow
suit. Making a faulty decision may be simply a matter of placing tools
in one spot instead of another. A non-cooperative attitude may involve
nothing more than creating an unpleasant situation among one‚Äôs fellow
workers, engaging in bickerings, or displaying surliness and stupidity.
‚Äì

<p>
Sometimes you read this manual and start wondering about the people you
meet, co-workers, customers, human resources departments, the whole
chain of command.
</p>
<p>
Here‚Äôs to hoping that you and your team are exempt. üòÅ
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Acts of simple sabotage are occurring throughout Europe. An effort
should be made to add to their efficiency, lessen their detectability,
and increase their number. Acts of simple sabotage, multiplied by
thousands of citizen-saboteurs, can be an effective weapon against the
enemy. Slashing tires, draining fuel tanks, starting fires, starting
arguments, acting stupidly, short-circuiting electric systems, abrading
machine parts will waste materials, man-power, and time. Occurring on a
wide scale, simple sabotage will be a constant and tangible drag on the
war effort of the enemy. ‚Äì
<a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Simple_Sabotage_Field_Manual/Possible_Effects">OSS
Simple Sabotage Manual, Possible Effects</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
To be part of the constant and tangible drag is the point.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Widespread practice of simple sabotage will harass and demoralize enemy
administrators and police. Further, success may embolden the
citizen-saboteur eventually to find colleagues who can assist him in
sabotage of greater dimensions. Finally, the very practice of simple
sabotage by natives in enemy or occupied territory may make these
individuals identify themselves actively with the United Nations war
effort, and encourage them to assist openly in periods of Allied
invasion and occupation. ‚Äì

<p>
I‚Äôm not sure who our allies are but one thing‚Äôs for sure: in times of
trouble we should be looking for allies at all levels of organisation.
And that means doing the work of maintaining relationships.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The ordinary citizen very probably has no immediate personal motive for
committing simple sabotage. Instead, he must be made to anticipate
indirect personal gain, such as might come with enemy evacuation or
destruction of the ruling government group. Gains should be stated as
specifically as possible for the area addressed: simple sabotage will
hasten the day when ‚Ä¶ and ‚Ä¶ deputies ‚Ä¶ will be thrown out, when
particularly obnoxious decrees and restrictions will be abolished, ‚Ä¶ and
so on. Abstract verbalizations about personal liberty, freedom of the
press, and so on, will not be convincing in most parts of the world. In
many areas they will not even be comprehensible. ‚Äì
<a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Simple_Sabotage_Field_Manual/Motivating_the_Saboteur">OSS
Simple Sabotage Manual, Motivating the Saboteur</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It‚Äôs a stark reminder to read that ‚Äúpersonal liberty, freedom of the
press, and so on, will not be convincing‚Äù but I think I see it at work,
now.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps this is because the people around me don‚Äôt depend on ‚Äúpersonal
liberty‚Äù for anything. They are free to do as they want because they
want what the new regime is doing. If you want what you are told there
is no need for liberty.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, if your means are so constrained and everything around you
requires money and power, then personal liberty is so constrained that
you don‚Äôt fear it‚Äôs loss.
</p>
<p>
And for people to want the free press, it‚Äôd be nice if the press didn‚Äôt
already tow the party line of money and power.
</p>
<p>
I guess in a roundabout way I am trying to say that all dictatorship
requires a large part of the population to acquiesce to it. The movies
might make one think that most people are in the resistance but in fact
they are not. Many are just interested in Ruhe und Ordnung, silence and
order.
</p>
<p>
Sadly, when I first heard about the US sliding into fascism thirty years
ago, I thought it impossible. Unthinkable. And yet here we are.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps it helps to think about a sliding scale from zero to Hitler. The
US is not yet invading Poland. But they seem to be ready to divvy up
Ukraine; or take Greenland. So where are we: 60%? 70%?

There is something interesting happening with blogging. For a long time,
blogs like this one were <em>the</em> way to opine, to share, to
bloviate. Then social media came along and stole blogging‚Äôs thunder,
with the average blogger gravitating towards long threads on Twitter
(<abbr class="initialism">RIP</abbr>; ‚Ä† ‚ö∞; üíÄ; etc., etc.) or
photo-heavy Instagram posts. Next came newsletters ‚Äî blogs delivered by
email, essentially ‚Äî which finally broke the social media hegemony.

<h1 id="2025-01-23-the-bots-are-at-it-again">
2025-01-23 The bots are at it again
</h1>
<p>
For a while I just appended new graphs and data to
<a href="2024-11-25-emacs-china">the last post on this topic</a>. This
time around I feel it‚Äôs worse. There are so many bots that I can‚Äôt even
do the WHOIS lookup any more. Or perhaps I just managed to block so few
that I never realized how many more there were. In any case, now that
I‚Äôm speeding things up, there are more bots to block.
</p>
<p>
<strong>If you want to partake in unsupervised banning with no feedback,
no due process, just automatic ban-hammers, take a look at this script
full of firewall commands.</strong>
</p>
<p>
It needs ipset and iptables access:
<a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a>.
</p>
<p>
I blocked another 4669 networks.
</p>
<p>
What I did was get the most recent 10000 lines from the Apache access
log, filter out all the requests for my GoToSocial instance (hoping that
it has good defences!?), grepping for the magic word,
<a href="/admin/network-lookup-lean">doing reverse lookups</a> using
<code>asn.routeviews.org</code> and banning them all. Looking at a
summary, there were two networks with 6 requests, 6 networks with 5
requests, etc. Of the 4669 networks banned, there were 3985 networks
with a single request only.
</p>
<p>
That is to say, the network lookup is not really all that efficient
because the requests are so incredibly diverse. There are essentially no
individual IP numbers to ban because there are no repeat offenders, and
even with that great ban-hammer of mine, this wouldn‚Äôt help against the
next 85% of requests because they are all unique.
</p>
<p>
Now, I was already banning about 10,000 networks yesterday, and their
success rate is still 85%! So that tells you that even this little
jousting I‚Äôm doing is tilting at windmills because these bots are
turning the web to shit.
</p>
<p>
Summing the numbers I see that I looked at 10,000 requests, discarded
all the hits for my GoToSocial instance and still had 5560 bot hits.
</p>
<p>
Every website everywhere is paying the distributed price for these
leeches to keep their projects running. Of course, I could rent a bigger
machine, run a bigger cache, spending more money and more time for their
scam.
</p>
<p>
I keep shouting ‚ÄúCO‚ÇÇ for the CO‚ÇÇ god!‚Äù and that‚Äôs part of it, yes‚Ä¶
Sadly!
</p>
<p>
Oh, and I could not post this on fedi because my GoToSocial instance is
unable to cope and takes a very long time to recover from the onslaught.
While I waited, I banned another 2184 networks. And I kept doing it.
</p>
<p>
Fuck this shit.
</p>
<p>
Fuck this whole generation.
</p>
<p>
Time passes.
</p>
<p>
Let me count how many entries I added today.
</p>
<pre><code>awk 'BEGIN {c=0; n=0} /^# 2025-01-23/ {c=1} c&amp;&amp;/^ipset/ {n++} END {print n}' \
  bin/admin/ban-cidr
14497
</code></pre>
<p>
I think it‚Äôs about time to add some fail2ban code. If only I knew how.
More cost they are putting on every single site operator and service
provider out there.

are still sluggish. I some sort of congestion issue.

<strong>2025-01-24</strong>. What I did all day, yesterday:
</p>
<pre><code># prefix with a timestamp
date; tail -n 2000 /var/log/apache2/access.log \
 | grep -v ^social \
 | grep &quot;rcidonly&quot; \
 | bin/admin/network-lookup-lean &gt; result.log

<p>
But today:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-01-23-bots-devouring-the-web-2.jpg" alt="After midnight, load climbed up to 40 and stayed up there" />
</p>
<p>
I think made a mistake, yesterday around midnight. I rebooted the server
and didn‚Äôt run the script! üò±
</p>
<p>
I thought the packages <code>netfilter-persistent</code>,
<code>iptables-persistent</code> and <code>ipset-persistent</code> took
care of that but that is not the case. See below for more.
</p>
<p>
In any case, I think the graphs above illustrates what happens to my
server without the firewall rules.
</p>
<p>
Grrr.
</p>
<p>
They said we‚Äôre running out of IPv4 numbers but now that I‚Äôm trying to
block bots descending like flesh flies on baby bison, it turns out that
there are still thousands of networks that need blocking. Holy cow may
Baal eat the eyes of all the engineers partaking in this scouring of the
web; may all the project managers rot and lose their teeth, their nails,
their hair and their sense of smell; let them all suffer these curses
until they repent, until they mend their ways and help undo the damage
they are wreaking.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Later that day</strong>. I got an email asking about the bots
and so I looked at the last run. Let‚Äôs take the last run:
</p>
<pre><code>$ head result.log
Made 763 DNS requests.
21 cache hits.
Range                          |       Hits |
------------------------------:|-----------:|
                       unknown |          4 |
                38.188.60.0/24 |          3 |
                201.46.36.0/22 |          3 |
                45.225.53.0/24 |          2 |
              170.246.119.0/24 |          2 |
               45.178.110.0/23 |          2 |
</code></pre>
<p>
The top hitting network I blocked in the last run had made just
<em>three</em> suspicious requests!
</p>
<p>
There is more info below:
</p>
<pre><code>38.188.60.0/24
38.188.60.92 38.188.60.70 38.188.60.70
38.188.60.0/24 | 38.188.60.92 | 24/Jan/2025:11:57:58 +0100 | GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;days=3&amp;rcidonly=Comments_on_VimMode&amp;showedit=0 HTTP/1.1 | Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/88.0.4324.150 Safari/537.36
38.188.60.0/24 | 38.188.60.70 | 24/Jan/2025:11:58:47 +0100 | GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;from=1730419325&amp;rcidonly=profh&amp;showedit=1 HTTP/1.1 | Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/73.0.3683.86 Safari/537.36
38.188.60.0/24 | 38.188.60.70 | 24/Jan/2025:12:01:02 +0100 | GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;days=3&amp;rcidonly=2013-11-08&amp;showedit=1 HTTP/1.1 | Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/100.0.3478.83 Safari/537.36
ipset add banlist 38.188.60.0/24
</code></pre>
<p>
So the three requests from this network came from just two different IP
numbers:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
38.188.60.92
</li>
<li>
38.188.60.70
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The first suspicious request is for a list of recent changes made in the
last 3 days for the page ‚ÄúComments on VimMode‚Äù.
</p>
<p>
Let‚Äôs check whether this is a false positive. Perhaps the request
belongs into a sequence that makes sense to a human?
</p>
<pre><code>$ grep 38.188.60.92 /var/log/apache2/access.log /var/log/apache2/access.log.1 
/var/log/apache2/access.log:www.emacswiki.org:443 38.188.60.92 - - [24/Jan/2025:11:57:58 +0100] &quot;GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;days=3&amp;rcidonly=Comments_on_VimMode&amp;showedit=0 HTTP/1.1&quot; 503 3868 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/88.0.4324.150 Safari/537.36&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>
This strange request is the only request this IP number made in over
24h.
</p>
<p>
The only explanation I have is that the URL belongs to a dataset used to
train AI, using bots running from machines rented all around the world.
Or it‚Äôs a denial of service attack.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-01-25</strong>. I think I finally understand the packages
about making it all persistent:
</p>
<p>
<code>netfilter-persistent</code> calls all the modules.
</p>
<p>
<code>iptables-persistent</code> is the module that saves
<code>/etc/iptables/rules.v4</code> and
<code>/etc/iptables/rules.v6</code> with just the rules.
</p>
<p>
<code>ipset-persistent</code> is the module that saves
<code>/etc/iptables/ipsets</code>. This file is about 1MB and pretty
much contains what <code>ban-cidr</code> contains.
</p>
<p>
And as it turns out, saving is never automatic.
</p>
<p>
You need to run <code>netfilter-persistent save</code> manually after
running <code>ban-cidr</code> for all the rules and sets to be loaded on
a reboot.

For now, I keep returning a 410 ‚ÄúGone‚Äù response to self-identified bots
and I just drop packets from networks that have hosted bots at the
firewall. There are probably problems with this system as packets from
fediverse instances hosted by the same providers get cut off, too. And
I‚Äôm not expiring the bans, unfortunately.

a book in French about inclusive language. I liked the blurb very much.
Like Portuguese, the language has a rule that if a group of people is
all women, use female forms, but if there just one man, no matter how
many women there are, use male forms. The blurb says how this pushes
women out of the public sphere because they are no longer perceived as
doing anything. And the blurb says that the speakers of a language have
a choice! We can change, and our language can change. It belongs to the
speakers who are alive now, not to the dead of the past.

formes f√©minines des noms de m√©tiers, ont √©t√© sciemment √©clips√©es pour

This is a bit related to discussions around the other languages I speak:
Is German German more German than Swiss or Austrian German? Is
Continental Portuguese more Portuguese than Brazilian Portuguese? Is
English English more English than Indian English or Irish English? No!
The language belongs to those who speak it.

It‚Äôs set in, like, a socialist colony on an alien planet, with lots of
gender &amp; sexual diversity and even polyamorous representation (hell
yes!). But also, it‚Äôs a time loop game ‚Äì you‚Äôre supposed to play through
it more than once, using the knowledge your character gains each run to
make better choices the next time around. I finished my first run today
(which took me 11.4 hours over four days‚Ä¶ hooked, I have been) and I‚Äôm
really excited to play the next one. It also has a beautiful art style
and great soundtrack!
</p>
<p>
The only thing is, while I was trying to avoid spoilers (which I usually
never do! Usually I‚Äôm like ‚Äúgimme that walkthrough‚Äù but with this one I
wanted to experience it first) I did read a lot of reviews that were
like, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre basically doomed to a bad ending on your first run,‚Äù but I
became‚Ä¶ a teacher. And because I had a rebellion score of 100/100, I
became the best kind of teacher who teaches the kids to ‚Äúquestion
everything‚Äù. I mean, there had been a lot of tragic deaths in the first
half of my run, but the ending itself didn‚Äôt really seem bad. Maybe what
people meant is that the ending didn‚Äôt magically undo the tragic deaths,
idk. I did see one review which was like, ‚Äúthis game is the worst, it
didn‚Äôt warn me I needed at least one skill at 100/100 by the end of the
game‚Äù but I had like‚Ä¶ five skills at 100/100; this was not a high bar to
clear. I have <em>now</em> looked up the list of possible endings and
honestly, I don‚Äôt even know what you get if you didn‚Äôt have any skills
at 100‚Ä¶
</p>
<p>
Oh yeah, and then the <em>other</em> thing was that the character I‚Äôd
been trying to romance fuckin‚Äô <span class="spoiler">planted a bomb and
peaced out for the last year or something of the game. Disappeared,
never to be seen again</span>. So I guess I have an idea for what I want
to focus on next time.

Albert Shanker with a nuclear weapon kind of fit his character as a bomb
throwing type in city politics in an extreme way. A fitting and comic
way for us to end it all. Proof that god has a sense of humor. It was an
inside reference only NYers would get. Well in case you didn‚Äôt know it,
back in that time or a little later, Trump was one of those Albert
Shanker types. And yes, now again he has all the nuclear weapons. And it
still feels like he‚Äôs only famous in a mediocre Queens real estate way.
Isn‚Äôt that weird?</p>

<p>We‚Äôre programmed to believe big companies make things the right way
and individual people can‚Äôt be trusted. We‚Äôre going to have to break out
of that rut, to stop trusting them so much. It‚Äôs like the 2008 banking
crisis, but this time they‚Äôve taken over the government, not just the
economy. The tech industry, believe it or not, started with assumption
that it was the other way around. That people were the brilliance, and
companies started wars to make money (we were the generation that
stopped the Vietnam war, btw). I got into computers because I thought I
could earn a living that way, but quickly discovered how inherently
subversive they are. They weren‚Äôt just for the nerds with the plastic
pocket protectors, they were also for hippies. Some of us are still here
and we want to create with you.</p>

Lobbyist Caught Hacking Climate Activists</h2>

The Department of Justice is investigating a lobbying firm representing
ExxonMobil for

<p>
The hacking was allegedly commissioned by a Washington, D.C., lobbying
firm,

to a lawyer representing the U.S. government</a>. The firm, in turn, was
allegedly working on behalf of one of the world‚Äôs largest oil and gas
companies, based in Texas, that wanted to discredit groups and
individuals involved in climate litigation, according to the lawyer for
the U.S. government. In court documents, the Justice Department does not

I joined the kickstarter a long time ago and got the device yesterday.
The package was nice. It works. The menu looks good ‚Äì always tricky with
a wheel user interface. My 16GiB SD card works, all I had to so was
reformat it using a VFAT file-system (whatever the Gnome Disks app
suggested). The device came semi-charged so it worked immediately.
Something rattles when I shake it. Maybe it‚Äôs the button? There is some
sort of haptic feedback with the UI which surprised me. The UI doesn‚Äôt
dim or go dark with inactivity, there‚Äôs a switch to do it. I guess I
like it. The music sounds great with my old Sennheiser Monument
cable-only headphones.

<h1 id="2025-01-27-using-rsync-with-sqlite-databases">
2025-01-27 Using rsync with Sqlite databases
</h1>
<p>
I use Debian stable so my copy of Sqlite is not the latest and greatest.
At the same time, I don‚Äôt use Borg Backup for my server. I use rsync.
</p>
<p>
I copy the content of the important server files to my local laptop and
then I make a backup of my laptop to external disks using Borg Backup.
</p>
<p>
When making copies using rsync, the database must not be in use.
Otherwise, a busy database is probably going to be corrupt when
restoring it from backup.
</p>
<p>
The key is to stop the program using the database before beginning the
backup and starting it after the backup. It‚Äôs also important to stop the
program using the monitoring software. I use Monit to monitor the
server. If I don‚Äôt stop GoToSocial using Monit, Monit will discover that
GoToSocial isn‚Äôt running and start it while rsync is still copying the
database file. The database file is 10G so copying it takes a long time.
Long enough for Monit to discover that GoToSocial isn‚Äôt running.
</p>
<p>
I should stop and start other programs, too: The Lounge, Norn, etc.
</p>
<p>
This is my script:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

# sibirocobombus.root is defined in ~/.ssh/config

# Using sudo rsync --archive to preserve ownership.
# Using --fake-super to avoid changes to groups and owners

echo Backing up Sibirocobombus

This might be my favorite song of all time. It‚Äôs by a slightly obscure
Chicago punk band called The Broadways, made up of a couple members from
the more well-known ska band Slapstick. It‚Äôs got everything you want in
a punk song. Palm mutes, open meedly-meedly parts, yelling, speed, a
half-time breakdown, and impeccable synchronicity. I listen to this song
when I‚Äôm sad, when I‚Äôm frustrated, when I‚Äôm in traffic, and when I need
to inject high octane fuel into my veins. The soaring octave chords will
always pick me back up again.
</p>
<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="markdown">All on the streets, the signs read
Cheaper and better technology
This capitalist vision is my nightmare

Put up a sign in my face
What the fuck happened to this place?
I think we made a wrong turn
Look at the lovely concrete

I drove to my stupid job today
Got stopped at an intersection
Fifteen minutes of my life just rolled away

Looked at the guy next to me
He didn't look too happy
No one's happy, but everyone's too busy to see

Let's go shopping today
Drive our fancy cars to the fancy malls
And for lunch we'll have Big Macs

I wish I could turn the clock back
Back to when I was ten
When I wasn't scared of everything
And everything wasn't so fucking crowded

And I wonder if my kid will ever see the horizon
Untouched by billboards and shopping malls
And I wonder if this crazy world
Thinks I'm the one that's crazy

What if I'm the one who's crazy?
What if I'm the one who's crazy?
What if I'm the one who's crazy?
What if I'm the one who's crazy?
I'm not crazy, just frustrated

<p>
WIthout a doubt, this song from my teenage years subliminally shaped a
lot of my views on what‚Äôs wrong with the world. Capitalist intrusions.
Eyeball monetization. The always upgrade tech cycle. Why I hate crowds.
And traffic. Life evaporating at a stop light seems like a criminal
waste of humanity to me. This may subconsciously be part of why I work
from home.
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôll never live up to my punk rock ideals or my teenage self, but this
song takes me back to them. Not to ‚Äúwhen I was ten‚Äù, but to ‚Äúwhen I was
seventeen‚Äù for sure. Driving through big city Houston at night. Going to
Food Not Bombs near the abandoned hospital. All it takes is the first
verse and BOOM! I‚Äôm transported through time and I can see the world
through my old anarcho-tinted glasses. It makes you want to smash
systems and break concrete.

<h2 id="is-bluesky-billionaire-proof">Is Bluesky billionaire-proof?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-28, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
Could what
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk">happened</a>
to Twitter, happen there?
</p>
<p>
To determine, ask yourself if you could continue to use it if it was
acquired by a billionaire for their own personal political use?
</p>
<p>
What would you switch to?
</p>
<p>
Would you have to give up your history and followers?
</p>
<p>
And developers, what would you do if the billionaire acquirer dropped
support for the api? How expensive and time consuming would it be to
convert to a different protocol? Would you even bother?
</p>
<p>
We‚Äôve learned a lot from the billionaire acquisition of twitter. The
answer to these questions made a lot of us think we‚Äôd never want to do
this again. But despite all the misleading hype, we very much are
repeating the mistakes.
</p>
<p>
The current owners of Bluesky would be crazy if they closed off the
opportunity to get rich. But they shouldn‚Äôt be misleading users and
developers into believing that it‚Äôs safe to trust this as an open
platform that couldn‚Äôt be acquired and have its utility consumed the way
twitter‚Äôs was.
</p>
<p>
This started as a
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3lgsgmmhyf22q">thread</a>
on Bluesky of course. :-)
</p>
<p>
PS: Spoiler ‚Äì Bluesky is, as it is currently configured, not
billionaire-proof. It‚Äôs going to get acquired, it probably already has,
based on what they‚Äôre doing. Remember, pay attention to what they do,
not what they say. It‚Äôs just as true in tech as it is in politics, and
these days, what‚Äôs the difference anyway?
</p>
<p>
PPS: If you‚Äôre thinking ahh but there‚Äôs
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol">AT Protocol</a>, our
ace in the hole. Please. Twitter had an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter#Technology">API</a> too.
It didn‚Äôt make a difference. And AT Proto won‚Äôt either unless there are
proven systems that people are actually using that peer with Bluesky‚Äôs
servers, so those users can‚Äôt be sold to the billionaire. We‚Äôre nowhere
near that. No one can say with any certainty that it‚Äôs even possible. At
this point the continued support of the API is entirely up to the owners
of Bluesky. They could change it, break developers or completely drop it
and the users and developers would have no recourse.
</p>
<p>
PPPS: Can you imagine the founders of Bluesky wouldn‚Äôt take $20 million
each for their share?

on preventing somebody from having their worst day. But ransomware is
still a problem. We have been laser-focused on PRC cyber actors. That
will continue to be a huge problem. I‚Äôm really proud of where we are,
but there‚Äôs much, much more work to be done. There are things that I
think we can continue driving, that the next administration, I hope,

<h2 id="rivers-on-bluesky">Rivers on Bluesky</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
This is a post for longtime Scripting News readers. As you know, I‚Äôve
been doing feed readers for a long time. They‚Äôve been mostly organized
around the
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22river%20of%20news%22">river
of news</a> concept, which also happens to be the way twitter-like
systems work. My rivers are built around
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> and formats
that interop with RSS.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/19/basketball.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Then
I got one of the ideas out of the blue that at first didn‚Äôt make sense,
but then the more I thought about the better the idea seemed. It came
from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mcuban.bsky.social">Mark
Cuban</a>, who liked one of my posts on Bluesky, it was about some
FeedLand rivers I had produced, and then I did what I often do ‚Äì I
offered to do something like that for him. For obvious reasons I don‚Äôt
need to go into here, you all are smart or you wouldn‚Äôt be reading this.
:-)
</p>
<p>
Anyway ‚Äì he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôd use that if it were on Bluesky.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
My first thought, ridiculous ‚Äì can‚Äôt be done. They have all these limits
that aren‚Äôt present in HTML. I don‚Äôt have any idea how I could make this
work. Here‚Äôs a
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/01/27/riverInFeedlandScreenshot.png">screen
shot</a> of what a river looks like in FeedLand.
</p>
<p>
But then after a few hours or days, the idea developed, as often
happens, and I decided it might work and was worth a try.
</p>
<p>
So I wrote a piece of software that hooked into FeedLand‚Äôs outbound news
flow, and picked out stories from the right feeds, and shot them over to
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/feediverse.bsky.social">an account on
Bluesky</a>. Thanks to
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mcuban.bsky.social">Cuban</a>, who
linked to it from his million+ follower account, it has 7.6K followers.
It uses the list of feeds in my
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=blogroll">blogroll</a>
on Scripting News to feed the river. I think it‚Äôs a really good
pioneering effort, with quite a few followers who are active. And it‚Äôs
going to stay running for the indefinite future. That was in December.
</p>
<p>
Now I‚Äôve gone a step further, and generalized the code so I can have N
of these rivers instead of just one. And to prove it works, I now have
two new rivers on Bluesky.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dave.feediverse.org">dave.feediverse.org</a>
‚Äì the <a href="https://news.scripting.com/?tab=dave">Dave tab</a> on my
news site. It subscribes to all the RSS feeds I generate. My linkblog,
Scripting News, even my YouTube channel which has an RSS feed. Chuck
Shotton requested this. It was a good idea so it was the
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dave.feediverse.org">first new
river</a> I did on Bluesky. Went on the air just yesterday and now has
10 followers.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nba.feediverse.org">nba.feediverse.org</a>
‚Äì then my project for this morning is to do the same thing for the NBA.
I‚Äôm a huge Knicks fan, and basically love all of the NBA. People say the
Knicks must win a championship, but I say who cares. If they keep
playing at this level, with new castmembers all the time, with the track
record of current management, I‚Äôm a totally happy campter. If we won a
championship all the more exciting, but after all those years in the
wilderness, it‚Äôs so nice to finally after all this time to have a great
NBA team in NY (and sorry the Nets don‚Äôt count). Anyway, there‚Äôs nothing
more really to say. If you like basketball, and use Bluesky ‚Äì
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nba.feediverse.org">here‚Äôs</a> what
you follow.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
One more thing ‚Äì no federation here folks. It‚Äôs very simple. No new
formats or protocols, built entirely on the tried-and-true RSS and OPML
formats for feeds and subscription lists. (And of course support for
Atom and RDF too.)
</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm glad Mark Cuban asked me to try this path, it provides something I
hadn‚Äôt thought of. Not just inbound feeds for Bluesky, inbound rivers.
All we need now is Markdown support, and then a
<a href="https://textcasting.org/">few more things</a>, and we‚Äôll be
back to where we were in 1997. :-)

<h2 id="what-is-a-sanctuary-city">What is a sanctuary city?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
I wonder if people understand what a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary_city">sanctuary
city</a> is.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
In a sanctuary city the local government accepts the fact that there are
people living in the city who are not there legally.
</li>
<li>
They want these people to be able to call the police without fear of
being turned into the feds. Otherwise crime would go unreported and that
would create much larger problems.
</li>
<li>
They want the children of these people, who are often American citizens,
to be able to go to school, again without having the parents reported to
the feds. If they didn‚Äôt guarantee that, the kids wouldn‚Äôt be in school,
and we all lose by having uneducated adults. It‚Äôs a core principle of
this country that educated citizens are a good thing.
</li>
<li>
They want them to be able to get health care, to go to a hospital when
someone is seriously ill or injured. This is partly for pragmatic
reasons, to slow disease spreading, and also because we are a rich
country and keeping people healthy is a good thing, just like education.
What other purpose could a government have? (A fair question for
Republicans, one they probably wouldn‚Äôt want to answer truthfully.)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Republican talking points make it sound like local governments that
declare as sanctuary cities are weak or immoral or anti-American, but
that is not what‚Äôs going on. You couldn‚Äôt run a city with huge crimes
commited against illegals because they would be so vulnerable, and kids
need education, and everyone needs health care. Yet I hear the word used
all the time in public discourse, and am concerned that most people
don‚Äôt know what it means.

A newly discovered
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/backdoor-infecting-vpns-used-magic-packets-for-stealth-and-security/">VPN
backdoor</a> uses some interesting tactics to avoid detection:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
When threat actors use backdoor malware to gain access to a network,
they want to make sure all their hard work can‚Äôt be leveraged by
competing groups or detected by defenders. One countermeasure is to
equip the backdoor with a passive agent that remains dormant until it
receives what‚Äôs known in the business as a ‚Äúmagic packet.‚Äù On Thursday,
researchers revealed that a never-before-seen backdoor that quietly took
hold of dozens of enterprise VPNs running Juniper Network‚Äôs Junos OS has
been doing just that‚Ä¶

<p>I re-read a book I first read in 2002 when the first UK paperback was
published, Louis Menand‚Äôs magnificent The Metaphysical Club: A story of
ideas in America. It takes a sweeping view of the reshaping of the

<h2 id="a-story-about-pans">A story about pans</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-26, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
The other day I sent my wife a link to
<a href="https://madeincookware.com/products/ceramic-frying-pan/set">a
new set of ceramic pans</a> and asked, ‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù assuming
she‚Äôd be as impressed as I was of the picture of eggs sliding off the
pan. Her response: a grimace. Using my sixteen years of husbandly
intuition, I surmised that we were not on the same page about
kitchenware.
</p>
<p>
For context, my wife has had the same stainless steel pans that her
parents bought her since we met. They‚Äôve outlasted the fancier non-stick
pans we‚Äôve auditioned. Her opinion of the pans is that they‚Äôre
high-quality because they‚Äôve lasted so long and still work. And from
that perspective she‚Äôs right, they technically still work‚Ä¶ but not
without some downsides.
</p>
<p>
When you use stainless steel pans instead of non-stick pans, you‚Äôre
committing to stickiness and having a harder time cleaning your pans. I
can accept that as an incurred cost. I think my bigger issue is that ALL
our pans do this. Even our cast irons which we‚Äôve made thousands of
batches of bacon with but still aren‚Äôt seasoned. If you make scrambled
eggs, about two eggs worth of material forms a brown sheet of crust on
the bottom of the pan that I must scrape off but NOT using soap per the
laws of properly seasoning a cast iron pan.
</p>
<p>
Anyways, my wife and I aren‚Äôt seeing eye-to-eye on the pans and I‚Äôm kind
of struggling to see why. I think there‚Äôs some frugalness afoot and
possibly some sentimental attachment to items that were gifts. And then
she ‚Äìwith her Deanna Troi, betazoid-levels of empathy‚Äì said ‚ÄúYou
probably think we need new ones because you do the dishes‚Äù and that was
our ah-ha moment!
</p>
<p>
In our house I‚Äôm the self-appointed dish-master because I can hyperfocus
on them while listening to an audiobook, pairing something I don‚Äôt like
with something I do like. My perspective on the pans is that they‚Äôre a
lot of work to clean up every night. Scraping and scrubbing the charred
chunky bits off so we can ruin them the next day. Essentially, I operate
at a different end of the ‚Äústack‚Äù of dishes than she does so we see the
situation differently. I have bigger feelings about the stickiness of
the pans because that‚Äôs the part that I interface with the most. I would
like to apply non-stick technology to improve the dish-washing process.
Where she sees something that works okay and we‚Äôve had for a long time,
while I see a maintenance burden.
</p>
<p>
Now we have an end-to-end/cross-team perspective of our pans and that is
valuable. We understand each other‚Äôs needs on a micro-level (the pans
are too sticky) and the macro-level (one side of the stack inherits more
burden with our pan choice) and that‚Äôs helpful for framing future
conversations about pans. That said, I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre getting new
pans any time soon. Such is life. Not all decisions are technical ones.
