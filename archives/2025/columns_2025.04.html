<h2 id="new-vpn-backdoor">New VPN Backdoor</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-27, updated: 2025-01-25, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
A newly discovered
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/backdoor-infecting-vpns-used-magic-packets-for-stealth-and-security/">VPN
backdoor</a> uses some interesting tactics to avoid detection:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
When threat actors use backdoor malware to gain access to a network,
they want to make sure all their hard work can’t be leveraged by
competing groups or detected by defenders. One countermeasure is to
equip the backdoor with a passive agent that remains dormant until it
receives what’s known in the business as a “magic packet.” On Thursday,
researchers revealed that a never-before-seen backdoor that quietly took
hold of dozens of enterprise VPNs running Juniper Network’s Junos OS has
been doing just that…

<h2 id="a-story-about-pans">A story about pans</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-26, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
The other day I sent my wife a link to
<a href="https://madeincookware.com/products/ceramic-frying-pan/set">a
new set of ceramic pans</a> and asked, “What do you think?” assuming
she’d be as impressed as I was of the picture of eggs sliding off the
pan. Her response: a grimace. Using my sixteen years of husbandly
intuition, I surmised that we were not on the same page about
kitchenware.
</p>
<p>
For context, my wife has had the same stainless steel pans that her
parents bought her since we met. They’ve outlasted the fancier non-stick
pans we’ve auditioned. Her opinion of the pans is that they’re
high-quality because they’ve lasted so long and still work. And from
that perspective she’s right, they technically still work… but not
without some downsides.
</p>
<p>
When you use stainless steel pans instead of non-stick pans, you’re
committing to stickiness and having a harder time cleaning your pans. I
can accept that as an incurred cost. I think my bigger issue is that ALL
our pans do this. Even our cast irons which we’ve made thousands of
batches of bacon with but still aren’t seasoned. If you make scrambled
eggs, about two eggs worth of material forms a brown sheet of crust on
the bottom of the pan that I must scrape off but NOT using soap per the
laws of properly seasoning a cast iron pan.
</p>
<p>
Anyways, my wife and I aren’t seeing eye-to-eye on the pans and I’m kind
of struggling to see why. I think there’s some frugalness afoot and
possibly some sentimental attachment to items that were gifts. And then
she –with her Deanna Troi, betazoid-levels of empathy– said “You
probably think we need new ones because you do the dishes” and that was
our ah-ha moment!
</p>
<p>
In our house I’m the self-appointed dish-master because I can hyperfocus
on them while listening to an audiobook, pairing something I don’t like
with something I do like. My perspective on the pans is that they’re a
lot of work to clean up every night. Scraping and scrubbing the charred
chunky bits off so we can ruin them the next day. Essentially, I operate
at a different end of the “stack” of dishes than she does so we see the
situation differently. I have bigger feelings about the stickiness of
the pans because that’s the part that I interface with the most. I would
like to apply non-stick technology to improve the dish-washing process.
Where she sees something that works okay and we’ve had for a long time,
while I see a maintenance burden.
</p>
<p>
Now we have an end-to-end/cross-team perspective of our pans and that is
valuable. We understand each other’s needs on a micro-level (the pans
are too sticky) and the macro-level (one side of the stack inherits more
burden with our pan choice) and that’s helpful for framing future
conversations about pans. That said, I don’t think we’re getting new
pans any time soon. Such is life. Not all decisions are technical ones.
