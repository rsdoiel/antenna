## Steves: Visiting Europe’s 20th century fascist sites

date: 2025-01-26, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>The fascist movements of 20th-century Europe had a sweeping impact around the world, in ways that still reverberate today. And travelers have an advantage when it comes to learning from this history: When we see its legacy in person, we better understand its lessons. Europe is dotted with fascinating monuments and powerful memorials that&#8217;ve been thoughtfully designed to bring those sobering lessons home. When we track the struggles of democracy on both sides of the Atlantic today, we can see that those intent on derailing democracy read from the same playbook.</p>

## Parents of college-bound students: How to manage the costs

In a recent College Ave survey, over half of parents of undergraduates (57%) said inflation was affecting their financial planning for college, and 62% said college costs were more than their family anticipated.
