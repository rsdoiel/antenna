date: 2025-05-05, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Needy Little Things</strong>, Channelle Desamours (Wednesday Books 978-1-250-33481-7, $20.00, 320pp, hc) February 2025.</p>
<p>Debut author Channelle Desamours has crafted a compelling mystery with her twisty, turning, keeps-you-guessing-until-the-end novel, <strong>Needy Little Things</strong>. (And that ending! Wow!)

## Commentary: Cory Doctorow: Strange Bedfellows and Long Knives

date: 2025-05-05, from: Locus Magazine

<p>If a group of people have been trying to get something done for some time without success, there are two possibilities: Either they’re failing because of bad tactics, or they’re failing because they simply lack the power to achieve their goals. When things start changing in big, dramatic ways, that means that some group in society has either discovered a new tactic, or they’ve found some new coalition partners.</p>
