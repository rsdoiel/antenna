Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0753 AM CDT Sun Mar 23 2025

Valid 231300Z - 241200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS NORTHEAST
TEXAS AND THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND MID-SOUTH...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms are possible this afternoon and
evening from East Texas into the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee
Valleys. Large hail and damaging gusts are the main hazards, but a
couple of tornadoes could also occur.

...Northeast Texas/Lower Mississippi Valley/Mid-South...
The region will be influenced by strengthening cyclonic flow aloft
as a shortwave trough takes on a more negative tilt over the upper
Mississippi Valley and upper Great Lakes. The moderately strong
winds aloft will overlie an increasingly moist air mass (surface
dewpoints developing into the 60s F) across the region in advance of
an east/southeastward-moving cold front. 

Destabilization will occur this afternoon ahead of the front, with
1000 J/kg MLCAPE as far north as the Missouri Bootheel, on the
southern edge of early day storms. Stronger instability will develop
farther south across the Mid-South and ArkLaTex/ArkLaMiss regions
with 1500-2000 J/kg MUCAPE possible. Given peak heating and
deepening moist boundary layer, scattered storms are likely to
develop and increase into mid/late afternoon along the length of the
front, and potentially just ahead of it within a zone of pre-frontal
confluence. Initial vigorous activity is likely to produce large
hail perhaps over 1.75". As low-level moisture increases, deep-layer
shear/low-level SRH will support supercells with some tornado risk
mainly across the ArkLaMiss/Mid-South. The evolving line of storms
is likely to persist for much of the evening as it shifts
east-southeastward into northern Alabama and central Mississippi.

## SPC Mar 23, 2025 Day 4-8 Severe Weather Outlook

date: 2025-03-23, from: NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/exper/day4-8/"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/exper/day4-8/day48prob.gif" border="1" alt="Day 4-8 Outlook Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="815" height="555" align="center" /></a><pre>
Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0402 AM CDT Sun Mar 23 2025

Valid 261200Z - 311200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Medium-range models appear to be in reasonable agreement with
large-scale features through Day 5 (Thursday Mar. 27), during which
time overall severe risk should remain generally tempered.  A weak
surface warm front should lie from northwest-to-southeast across
Texas Day 4/Wednesday, with a secondary boundary lying
northwest-to-southeast from the northern High Plains to Kansas. 
However, background ridging over the Rockies/western portions of the
Plains should suppress convection to some degree.  This, along with
modest mid-level flow (generally 20 to 30 kt) expected across the
area will limit risk, though a few stronger central/southern High
Plains storms may evolve during the afternoon and evening.

On Day 5/Thursday, a weak southern-stream trough is forecast to
undercut the northern-stream ridge, shifting into the southern
Plains with time.  While overall instability should once again
remain limited -- largely due to still-limited moisture return -- a
few stronger storms will again be possible during the afternoon and
evening.  One area of more focused potential for a few storms
appears to exist over eastern portions of Nebraska and Kansas near
the slowly northward-advancing warm front; a few stronger afternoon
storms may also occur across portions of western Texas.

Day 6/Friday, models begin to diverge more substantially, with this
divergence increasing through the end of the period.  Models hint
that a stronger trough may begin advancing across the West, and
into/across the Plains Days (next weekend).  This would be
associated with stronger surface development, more robust northward
moisture transport, and more favorable flow aloft.  Thus, while
severe risk appears likely to increase, differences in the models
with respect to details of this evolution preclude any confident
introduction of risk areas at this time.

## SPC Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

date: 2025-03-22, from: NOAA Weather Forecasts

<br /><a href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/fire_wx/fwdy2.html"><img src="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/fire_wx/day2fireotlk.gif" border="1" alt="Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook Image" hspace="1" vspace="1" width="815" height="555" align="center" /></a><pre>
Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0205 AM CDT Sat Mar 22 2025

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...Synopsis...
Low amplitude ridging over the West is forecast to continue
intensifying as mid-level northwesterly flow remains in place over
the central CONUS. A shortwave trough and strong jet will move over
the Plains Sunday, strengthening a surface low and cold front as
they move to the east. Dry and windy conditions are expected behind
the front, supporting elevated fire-weather potential over parts of
the southern Plains.

...Southern Plains...
As the cold front and surface low move over the southern Plains
strong northerly winds are likely behind it across parts of KS, TX
and OK. Sustained winds of 15-25 mph with higher gusts are likely
through much of the day. Dry conditions overnight will keep minimum
RH values low (generally around 30-35%) despite cooling surface
temperatures behind the front through the day. In combination with
the strong winds and several days of recent drying, area fuels will
be receptive. Several hours of elevated fire-weather conditions
appear likely. Localized critical conditions are also possible, but
the strongest winds are expected over areas of western and central
KS where recent rainfall has tempered fuels. This should limit more
widespread critical concerns.

Mesoscale Discussion 0241
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0554 AM CDT Wed Mar 19 2025

Areas affected...Parts of western/central KS into central/eastern
NE...northwest IA...and extreme southeast SD/south-central MN

Concerning...Blizzard 

Valid 191054Z - 191600Z

SUMMARY...Blizzard conditions will gradually spread eastward through
the morning. Snow rates of 1-2+ inches per hour are possible, along
with widespread 50-60+ mph gusts.

DISCUSSION...Blizzard conditions are ongoing this morning from
southwest/south-central NE into western KS, to the northwest of a
powerful 987 mb cyclone centered over northeast KS. Very strong
deep-layer ascent will continue to  support heavy precipitation
rates through the morning, aided by very favorable low/midlevel
frontogenesis, and the presence of elevated buoyancy and
regenerative convection along the eastern periphery of heavier
precipitation, near the midlevel dry slot. The heaviest
precipitation rates will gradually shift eastward through the
morning, in conjunction with the movement of the cyclone, while
low-level cold advection and strong ascent result in cooling of the
column and a changeover to snow in areas that are currently in the
mid/upper 30s F. 

Meanwhile, very strong low-level flow increasing to near/above 70 kt
at 1 km AGL (as noted on the KUEX VWP) will continue to support wind
gusts in the 50-70 mph range (as already noted through the night
across parts of KS/NE), resulting in widespread blowing snow and
blizzard conditions. 

Short-term guidance generally suggests that the heaviest snow rates
will become focused from central/northern KS into northeast
NE/northwest IA later this morning. Areas within the most intense
snow bands may experience rates of 1-2+ inches per hour, along with
wind gusts near/above 60 mph, near-zero visibility, and occasional
lightning. A rather sharp gradient in snow rates is expected along
the eastern periphery of the heavier precipitation, though the very
strong wind gusts may result in blizzard conditions even in areas
that experience only light to moderate snow.

Mesoscale Discussion 0222
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0628 AM CDT Sun Mar 16 2025

Areas affected...North Florida and southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 161128Z - 161300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A broken band of storms will spread eastward into
southeast Georgia and north Florida through late morning.  A new
tornado watch appears likely.

DISCUSSION...A broken band of storms has persisted overnight from
south central GA into the eastern FL Panhandle, with
occasional/embedded supercell structures.  Low-level moistening over
the next few hours and the onset of diurnal heating will drive
destabilization across north FL/southeast GA later this morning. 
Though the low-level jet core will develop northeastward toward the
Carolinas through the day, low-level flow/shear will remain
sufficiently strong to support additional supercells through the
morning across north FL/southeast GA.  The storms will remain
capable of producing occasional damaging winds and possibly a couple
of tornadoes, and a new tornado watch will likely be needed from
12-13z.
