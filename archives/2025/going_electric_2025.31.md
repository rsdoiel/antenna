## The oddly personal truth about ADAS: self-driving cars are like running shoes

date: 2025-08-08, from: Electrek Feed

<div class="feat-image"><img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/08/HONDA_SENSING.jpg?quality=82&#038;strip=all&#038;w=1600" /></div><p>There you are, motoring along in your <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/09/04/first-look-at-substantially-updated-2025-volvo-xc90-plug-in-hybrid/">Volvo XC90 PHEV</a> with the Pilot Assist engaged alongside a big 18-wheeler at a comfortable 70 mph cruise when the interstate starts to slowly sweep left. From the drivers’ seat, that semi on your right looks awfully close. As the steering wheel turns itself in your hand, you start to wonder if that truck’s a bit <em>too</em> close. The car isn’t doing anything <em>wrong</em>, but it’s too close for <em>your</em> comfort and you give the wheel a little nudge to hug the inside of the lane just a bit more.</p>



<p>These deeply personal preferences are tough to quantify, and highlight a simple fact about Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) that the industry at-large hasn’t yet to come to terms with: <strong>when it comes to self-driving cars, one size does not fit all</strong>.</p>
