## Blog questions challenge

date: 2025-02-12, from: Rachel Kwon blog

<p>Two of my favorite people on the internet, <a href="https://nazhamid.com/">Naz</a> and <a href="https://kayserifserif.place/">Katherine</a>, tagged me in this challenge, so here I am filling it in.</p>
<p>(By the way, <em>[hikes up grandpa pants]</em>, we used to call these &ldquo;blog memes,&rdquo; and because we didn&rsquo;t I didn&rsquo;t have many IRL friends who were also internet culture, at least not that I knew of, I&rsquo;d never heard the word out loud and definitely thought it was pronounced &ldquo;meh-mehs.&rdquo; And then memes evolved into something different — what we now commonly think of as internet jokes and viral trends, rather than these early “blog challenges.”)</p>

## llm-sort

date: 2025-02-11, updated: 2025-02-11, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/vagos/llm-sort">llm-sort</a></strong></p>
Delightful <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> plugin by Evangelos Lamprou which adds the ability to perform "semantic search" - allowing you to sort the contents of a file based on using a prompt against an LLM to determine sort order.</p>
<p>Best illustrated by these examples from the README:</p>
<pre><code>llm sort --query "Which names is more suitable for a pet monkey?" names.txt

cat titles.txt | llm sort --query "Which book should I read to cook better?"
</code></pre>
<p>It works using this pairwise prompt, which is executed multiple times using Python's <code>sorted(documents, key=functools.cmp_to_key(compare_callback))</code> mechanism:</p>
<pre><code>Given the query:
{query}

Compare the following two lines:

Line A:
{docA}

Line B:
{docB}

Which line is more relevant to the query? Please answer with "Line A" or "Line B".
</code></pre>
<p>From <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/yxlisx/llm_sort_sort_input_lines_semantically#c_enduz7">the lobste.rs comments</a>, Cole Kurashige:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm not saying I'm prescient, but in The Before Times <a href="https://github.com/cole-k/turksort">I did something similar</a> with Mechanical Turk</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This made me realize that <em>so many</em> of the patterns we were using against Mechanical Turk a decade+ ago can provide hints about potential ways to apply LLMs.

## Philosophy of Technology in Rhetoric and Writing Studies

date: 2025-02-11, from: Digital Humanities Quarterly News

The philosophy of technology is fundamentally concerned with interrogating the epistemic, ontological, and ethical underpinnings of human engagements with technological systems, artifacts, and infrastructures. It compels us to reflect not only on the instrumental logic that drives technological development—e.g., assumptions of efficiency, optimization, and progress—but also on the deeper ontological and epistemological entanglements that shape [...]

## My time machine runs on technical writing

<p>This past weekend I’ve been experimenting with AI-assisted coding to port basic docs-as-code elements to old operating systems and platforms, such as the venerable Intel 386. While this might strike you as a bizarre display of futility, I find this sort of retrocomputing exercise to be quite beneficial, if not enlightening. Something just clicks when you stop and walk backwards.</p>

## Cerebras brings instant inference to Mistral Le Chat

<p><strong><a href="https://cerebras.ai/blog/mistral-le-chat">Cerebras brings instant inference to Mistral Le Chat</a></strong></p>
Mistral <a href="https://mistral.ai/en/news/all-new-le-chat">announced a major upgrade</a> to their <a href="https://chat.mistral.ai/chat">Le Chat</a> web UI (their version of ChatGPT) a few days ago, and one of the signature features was performance.</p>
<p>It turns out that performance boost comes from hosting their model on Cerebras:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are excited to bring our technology to Mistral – specifically the flagship 123B parameter Mistral Large 2 model. Using our Wafer Scale Engine technology, we achieve over 1,100 tokens per second on text queries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given Cerebras's so far unrivaled inference performance I'm surprised that no other AI lab has formed a partnership like this already.
