The idea is that you get a paper-like reading and writing experience while also allowing you to organize, archive, and search your notes digitally. And the¬†reMarkable Paper Pro is the company&#8217;s biggest, fastest, most versatile model to date. Launched last fall as a [&#8230;]</p>

## How Safari Search Engine Extensions Work

Jeff Johnson (Hacker News): Note below how Safari says &#8220;Search Google&#8221; and &#8220;Google Search&#8221;, even though I&#8217;m supposed to be using Kagi.[&#8230;]Safari connects to Kagi only after connecting to Google.[&#8230;]An unfortunate consequence is that Safari always sends your search to your default search engine, Google for example, before it sends your search to your custom [&#8230;]

## My time machine runs on technical writing

date: 2025-02-10, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

<p>This past weekend I‚Äôve been experimenting with AI-assisted coding to port basic docs-as-code elements to old operating systems and platforms, such as the venerable Intel 386. While this might strike you as a bizarre display of futility, I find this sort of retrocomputing exercise to be quite beneficial, if not enlightening. Something just clicks when you stop and walk backwards.</p>

## Cerebras brings instant inference to Mistral Le Chat

Mistral <a href="https://mistral.ai/en/news/all-new-le-chat">announced a major upgrade</a> to their <a href="https://chat.mistral.ai/chat">Le Chat</a> web UI (their version of ChatGPT) a few days ago, and one of the signature features was performance.</p>
<p>It turns out that performance boost comes from hosting their model on Cerebras:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are excited to bring our technology to Mistral ‚Äì specifically the flagship 123B parameter Mistral Large 2 model. Using our Wafer Scale Engine technology, we achieve over 1,100 tokens per second on text queries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given Cerebras's so far unrivaled inference performance I'm surprised that no other AI lab has formed a partnership like this already.
