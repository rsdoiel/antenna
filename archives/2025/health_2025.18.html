systems to study Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections: an overview of
scientific potential and impediments</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Despite years of global efforts to combat tuberculosis (TB),
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of this disease,
continues to haunt the humankind making TB elimination a distant task.
To comprehend the pathogenic nuances of this organism, various in vitro,
ex vivo and in vivo experimental models have been employed by
researchers. This review focuses on the salient features as well as pros
and cons of various model systems employed for TB research. In vitro and
ex vivo macrophage infection models have been extensively used for
studying Mtb physiology. Animal models have provided us with great
wealth of information and have immensely contributed to the
understanding of TB pathogenesis and host responses during infection.
Additionally, they have been used for evaluation of anti-mycobacterial
drug therapy as well as for determining the efficacy of potential
vaccine candidates. Advancements in various ‘omics’ based approaches
have enhanced our understanding about the host-pathogen interface.
Although animal models have been the cornerstone to TB research, none of
them is ideal that gives us a complete picture of human infection,
disease and progression. Further, the review also discusses about the
newer systems including three dimensional (3D)-tissue models,
lung-on-chip infection model, in vitro TB granuloma model and their
limitations for studying TB. Thus, converging information gained from
various in vitro and ex vivo models in tandem with in vivo experiments
will ultimately bridge the gap that exists in understanding human
TB.</p>

pylori induced miR-362-5p upregulation drives gastric cancer progression
and links hepatocellular carcinoma through an exosome-dependent
pathway</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionHelicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection induced miRNA
dysregulation plays an important role in gastric cancer (GC) and
exosomes mediate the spread of pathogenic effects.MethodsExpression of
miR-362-5p and its clinical significance in GC were analyzed using data
from TCGA. The effects of miR-362-5p on GC cells’ proliferation and
migration were examined by using CCK-8, EdU, transwell and scratch
assays. MKN45 xenograft model in nude mice was employed to evaluate
impacts of miR-362-5p on GC progression in vivo. Target gene of
miR-362-5p was screened by bioinformatic analysis and verified by using
dual-luciferase assay. Exosomes from H. pylori-infected GES-1 cell
(Hp-GES-EVs) were isolated and miR-362-5p inside the exosome was
detected. The uptake of exosome by GC cells was observed through
fluorescence imaging and exosome-mediated pathogenesis was explored.
Furthermore, the transport of exosome-mediated miR-362-5p via blood was
examined. The effect of exosome-carried miR-362-5p on hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) progression was investigated by hepatocyte’s uptake,
proliferation and migration assays.ResultsmiR-362-5p was significantly
upregulated in GC tissues associated with H. pylori infection.
Downregulation of miR-362-5p in GC cells inhibited proliferation and
migration in vitro and suppressed tumor growth in vivo, counteracting H.
pylori-induced carcinogenesis. TLE4 was confirmed as a direct target of
miR-362-5p, and miR-362-5p/TLE4 axis implicated in H. pylori-driven
neoplastic transformations in GC cells. Hp-GES-EVs mediated the
transport of miR-362-5p, was absorbed by GC cells and detected at
elevated levels in the serum of infected mice. Moreover, Hp-GES-EVs were
diffused to liver and taken up by liver cells, enhancing HCC cell
proliferation and migration by targeting TLE4.ConclusionH. pylori
infection upregulates miR-362-5p, facilitating GC progression via TLE4
targeting. Exosome-mediated transfer amplifies its effects, contributing
to liver damage and potentially facilitating HCC.</p>

T3SS structural and effector genes of Chlamydia trachomatis are
expressed in distinct phenotypic cell forms</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Bacteria in the Chlamydiales order are obligate intracellular
parasites of eukaryotic cells. Within this order, the genus Chlamydia
contains the causative agents of a number of clinically important
infections in humans. Biovars of Chlamydia trachomatis are the causative
agents of trachoma and the leading cause of preventable blindness
worldwide, as well as sexually transmitted infections with the potential
to cause pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. Irrespective of
the resulting disease, all chlamydial species share the same obligate
intracellular life cycle and developmental cell forms. They are reliant
on an infectious cycle consisting of at least three phenotypically
distinct cell forms termed the reticulate body (RB), the intermediate
body (IB), and the elementary body (EB). The EB is infectious but does
not replicate. The RB replicates in the host cell but is non-infectious,
while the IB is an intermediate form that transitions to the EB form. In
this study, we ectopically expressed the transcriptional repressor Euo,
the two nucleoid-associated proteins HctA and HctB, and the
two-component sensor kinase CtcB in the RB. Transcriptional analysis
using RNA-seq, differential expression clustering, and fluorescence in
situ hybridization analysis shows that the chlamydial developmental
cycle is driven by three distinct regulons corresponding to the RB, IB,
or EB cell forms. Moreover, we show that the genes for the type III
secretion system (T3SS) were cell type restricted, suggesting defined
functional roles for the T3SS in specific cell forms.ImportanceChlamydia
trachomatis, a sexually transmitted bacterial infection, poses a
significant global health threat, causing over 100 million infections
annually and leading to complications like ectopic pregnancy and
infertility. This study investigates the gene expression patterns of C.
trachomatis during its unique life cycle within human cells. As an
obligate intracellular parasite, C. trachomatis transitions through
distinct developmental stages—one for infection and dissemination,
another for replication, and a third for transitioning back to the
infectious form. By analyzing gene expression profiles at each stage, we
identified key genes involved in these processes. Interestingly, our
research also reveals the presence of two separate type III secretion
system (T3SS) translocons expressed in distinct stages, suggesting their
crucial roles in specific functions during the infection cycle.</p>

microbiota differences linked to weight gain and ART in people living
with HIV are enterotype specific and minor compared to the large
differences linked to sexual behavior</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionSpecific antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens are
associated with weight gain in people living with HIV (PLWH). Gut
microbiota is involved in weight gain in humans and animals. Human gut
microbiota can be classified into enterotypes with distinct microbial
and functional profiles.MethodsIn a cohort of 118 PLWH, we analyzed the
gut microbiome in relation to weight gain and ART regimen using 16S rRNA
gene sequencing, taking enterotype classification into
account.ResultsThe enterotype was strongly associated with sexual
orientation. Of the 67 individuals forming a Prevotella-dominated
enterotype cluster in principal coordinates analysis, 93% were men who
had sex with men (MSM), while 31% of individuals in the
Bacteroides-dominated enterotype cluster were MSM and 69% were non-MSM.
Forty-nine genera differed significantly between the MSM and non-MSM
individuals. When stratified by dominant genus, only six taxa were
associated with weight gain. Of these, five were restricted to
Bacteroides-dominated individuals. Among them, the class Actinobacteria
and genus Bifidobacterium differed between individuals gaining more than
5% weight and less than 5% weight 1 year after ART switch. Additionally,
three taxa were significantly different between 15% of individuals with
the highest weight gain (≥6.3%) and the highest weight loss (≤3.19%) 1
year after ART switch, including the phyla Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia,
and Synergistetes. Distinct functional properties in Bacteroides, but
not Prevotella-dominated enterotype individuals, linked to weight gain
were observed, particularly for glycan and lipid metabolism.
Additionally, ART regimen-associated differences were observed for the
phylum Actinobacteria, although this was limited to Prevotella-dominated
enterotype individuals.DiscussionDifferences in the composition and
functional characteristics of the gut microbiome associated with weight
gain and ART regimens were enterotype-specific and relatively small
compared with differences linked to sexual orientation. Due to the
substantial differences in gut microbiome structure among many MSM,
categorization into enterotypes is useful for identifying differences in
microbiome composition associated with variables such as weight gain or
ART, which may be limited to a single enterotype. This may further
advance the identification of microbes that contribute to weight gain or
alter the gut microbiome composition in the context of the
enterotype.</p>

id="microrna-warfare-how-chickens-combat-klebsiella-variicola-with-gga-mir-2954">MicroRNA
warfare: how chickens combat Klebsiella variicola with gga-miR-2954</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Klebsiella variicola is a member of Klebsiella pneumoniae complex and
an emerging zoonotic pathogen. As part of the lymphatic system, the
spleen plays a pivotal role in destroying invading pathogens. Various
microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in host resistance to pathogens.
However, specific miRNAs that act against K. variicola remain unknown.
Therefore, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of the miRNA profile of the chicken
spleen was conducted to further clarify the host immune response to K.
variicola infection. Challenge of 7-day-old chicks with K. variicola
strain AHKV-S01 caused severe damage and enlargement of the spleen. In
total, 22 differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs (fold change&gt;2, q&lt;
0.05) were identified. Functional annotation analysis of the target
genes of DE miRNAs found that signaling pathways related to innate
immunity, inflammation, and metabolism were significantly enriched.
Notably, expression of gga-miR-2954 was significantly upregulated in the
infection group as compared to the control group. In vitro, gga-miR-2954
directly repressed luciferase reporter gene activity by binding to the
3′ untranslated regions of STAB1. Overexpression of gga-miR-2954 in HD11
macrophages significantly inhibited expression of STAB1, which is
involved in activation of several proinflammatory cytokines. K.
variicola induced damage to the spleen by over activation of
inflammatory and innate immune responses. The observed changes to the
miRNA expression profile of the chicken spleen elucidate host immune
responses to K. variicola infection, providing critical insights for
developing novel therapeutic strategies to enhance chicken resistance
against this pathogen.</p>

risk factors and the efficacy of glucocorticoid therapy in severe fever
with thrombocytopenia syndrome: a multicenter retrospective cohort
study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundSevere fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an
emerging tick-borne infectious disease characterized by rapid
progression and high mortality. Glucocorticoids (GCs) can be used as
anti-inflammatory agents for SFTS, but no standardized protocols have
been proposed.MethodsA total of 901 patients with SFTS diagnosed at two
hospitals between July 2017 and October 2023 were included in this
retrospective cohort study. Univariate and multivariate logistic
regression were performed along with LASSO regression to identify
independent risk factors of fatal outcomes and further develop mortality
prediction model. A nomogram was used to visualize the predictive model.
ROC curves, calibration curves, and DCA curves were conducted to assess
model accuracy and clinical applicability. The efficacy of GC was
assessed using survival analyses, and further subgroup analyses of the
effects of different GC regimens on fatal outcomes and hospital-acquired
infections (HAI) were performed. Propensity score matching (PSM)
analyses were conducted to control confounding factors.ResultsOlder age
(age &gt; 69 years), consciousness disturbance, decreased monocyte
counts, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and high
viral load were identified as strong predictors of fatal outcomes in
patients with SFTS. Patients were classified into mild and severe groups
according to risk scores calculated by the nomogram (cut-off value =
121.43). Survival analyses showed that GCs treatment may reduce the
mortality in severe patients (p = 0.004). Further subgroup analyses
indicated that relatively high doses and early treatment with GCs may
increase mortality in SFTS patients [OR = 2.292 (1.071, 5.066); OR =
3.693 (1.710, 8.345) respectively]. GCs treatment was associated with an
elevated risk of HAI in patients both with mild and severe SFTS (p =
0.024; p = 0.015, respectively). Initiation of GCs therapy at a low
level of aspartate aminotransferase (AST &lt; 189.75 U/L) reduced the
mortality before and after PSM (p&lt;0.001; p = 0.004,
respectively).ConclusionsA new nomogram based on five independent risk
factors effectively predicts the prognosis of SFTS. Severe patients and
those with low AST levels might benefit from GCs therapy while early and
relatively high doses of GCs therapy should be used with caution.</p>

analysis of microbiome and metabolome reveals insights into cervical
neoplasia aggravation in a Chinese cohort</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionCervical carcinoma (CC) remains one of the significant
cancers threatening women’s health globally. Increasing evidence
suggests that alterations in the microbiota are closely associated with
cancer development. However, the understanding of reliable biomarkers
and underlying mechanisms during the aggravation of cervical neoplasia
such as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and CC is still
relatively limited.MethodsIn this study, cervical swab samples from 53
healthy controls, 51 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL),
and 52 CC patients were subjected to 16S rDNA sequencing and
metabolomics analysis.ResultsWe observed significant differences in the
cervical microbiota between CC patients and healthy controls or HSIL
groups. Compared to the healthy controls, CC patients exhibited
increased microbial diversity, decreased abundance of Lactobacillus, and
notable changes in microbial composition. Metabolomics analysis revealed
significantly elevated levels of the inflammatory mediator Prostaglandin
E2 (PGE2) in CC samples. Through random forest modeling and ROC curve
analysis, we identified a combination of key microbiota (Porphyromonas,
Pseudofulvibacter) and metabolites (Cellopentaose, PGE2) as diagnostic
biomarkers with high diagnostic value for CC. Furthermore, we found a
significant correlation between the cervical microbiota Porphyromonas
and the metabolite PGE2, suggesting a potential role of key microbiota
in inducing inflammation.DiscussionThese findings indicate that
alterations in cervical microbiota and metabolites may be closely
associated with the occurrence and aggravation of cervical neoplasia,
providing new insights for further understanding the mechanisms of
cervical neoplasia progression and developing novel diagnostic markers
and therapeutic approaches.</p>

and molecular aspects of periodontitis pathogenesis: an
infection-induced inflammatory condition</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Periodontitis (PD) is the most common oral infectious disease. The
primary etiologic cause of the onset and development of PD is dental
plaque, which consists of bacterial biofilm domiciled within a complex
extracellular mass. In PD patients, there is a progressive breakdown of
the periodontal ligament and the alveolar bone. In more advanced stages,
tooth loss occurs. The progression of this chronic inflammatory disease
involves interactions among numerous microbial pathogens particularly,
bacteria, the host’s immune factors, and various environmental factors.
Due to persistent infection by periodonto-pathogenic bacteria, there is
an impairment of both innate and acquired immunity, leading to tissue
destruction. Chronic inflammation in PD may be associated with several
systemic diseases, including cardiovascular conditions, respiratory
issues, diabetes, neurological diseases, cancer, and adverse pregnancy
outcomes. Antibiotic treatment is one of the effective strategies for
treating PD cases, although the emergence of some resistant strains may
limit the effectiveness some antibiotics. In this review study, we
discussed the main bacteria in PD, the interaction with the immune
response, the pathogenesis of bacteria in PD and antibiotic treatment.
We also outlined the emergence of resistance to antibiotics among these
pathogens.</p>

between periodontitis, type 2 diabetes mellitus and COVID-19 disease: a
narrative review</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Inflammation plays a fundamental role in the development and
bidirectional association of di-verse diseases, such as periodontitis
and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which generates important clinical
complications, where chronic exposure to high levels of blood glucose
affects the repair process of periodontal tissues. Likewise, it has been
observed that comorbidity, between these two diseases, influences the
development of the COVID-19 disease towards a more severe course.
However, there is currently very little scientific evidence on the
relationship between periodontitis, T2DM and COVID-19 disease. This
narrative review aims to provide an understanding of the current and
most relevant aspects of the relationship between periodontitis, T2DM
and COVID-19 disease. A narrative review was performed through a
systematic search of published studies, without date restrictions,
indexed in the electronic databases of PubMed, for the inclusion of
articles in English, and LILACS for the inclusion of articles in
Spanish. This review included different articles, which addressed the
most important aspects to present a current perspective on the
relationship and influence between periodontitis, T2DM and COVID-19
disease. Comorbidity between periodontitis and T2DM represents a greater
risk of developing a more severe course of COVID-19 disease, because
these three diseases share three important axes: a clinicopathological
axis; an axis associated with glycemia, and an immunological axis
associated with inflammation.</p>

an indirect ELISA utilizing gD protein to detect antibodies against
bovine herpesvirus type 1</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1) is a highly contagious DNA virus
that causes a variety of diseases affecting the reproductive and
respiratory tracts. These diseases can reduce the health and production
performance of cattle, causing significant economic losses in the cattle
industry. The current ELISA kits used to detect BHV-1 have long lead
times and are expensive, and are not suitable for bulk testing on large
farms. therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a rapid and
cost-effective alternative to the BHV-1 test. In this study, recombinant
gD protein was expressed by prokaryotic system, and then used as antigen
to immunize New Zealand white rabbits to obtain polyclonal antibodies
(pAb). An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA) based on
gD protein was established for the detection of BHV-1 antibodies in
clinical samples. The optimal cutoff value was determined to be 0.6185
using 60 clinical serum samples. This method had no cross-reaction with
other common bovine viruses. The developed iELISA method and
commercially available kits were used to detect 60 bovine serum samples,
with a concordance rate of 93.3%. In summary, we established a rapid and
reliable iELISA method based on gD protein, which is suitable for
epidemio-logical monitoring of BHV-1.</p>

<p>ObjectiveTo explore the clinical value of extending the culture time
for accurately diagnosing hip or knee PJI.MethodsThis retrospective
study included 201 hip or knee PJI patients. All specimens were cultured
using a standardized procedure. For all samples collected after January
2022, the extended culture period was 14 to 21 days. The detection
accuracy and pathogen distribution of the standard culture duration (7
days) was compared with those extending.ResultsThe overall culture
positivity rate was 89.05% (179/201). The most common pathogens were
coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS, n=54) and methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, n=26). Extending the culture duration did
not significantly increase the culture positivity rate (89.05%
vs. 89.06%, P=0.997), nor did it improve the infection control rate
(89.05% vs. 85.94%, P=0.526). Further study revealed that extended
results did not improve the diagnosis of PJI according to the
Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) criteria in most patients with
both positive standard and extended culture results (82.35%, 28/34).
Four of the 5 patients with only positive extended culture results were
diagnosed with PJI on the basis of a single positive culture
result.ConclusionExtending the culture time didn’t significantly improve
the clinical outcomes of PJI, rate of culture positivity or
polymicrobial infection detection rate.</p>

fibrinogen-binding protein as a candidate adherence factor</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Bacterial vaginosis (BV), a form of vaginal dysbiosis, is associated
with numerous adverse reproductive and obstetric outcomes. Gardnerella
spp. are among the key bacteria identified in most BV cases. The
formation of a polymicrobial Gardnerella-dominated biofilm on the
vaginal epithelium is a characteristic diagnostic marker of BV.
Gardnerella colonization and biofilm formation indicate a significant
adhesion potential, the determinants of which remain unexplored. In this
initial approach to identify Gardnerella adhesins, we analyzed the Cna
protein located on the G. vaginalis ATCC 14018 cell surface as
determined previously. Structure modeling of Cna (designated Grd Cna)
revealed that the protein contains N2 and N3 domains with an
immunoglobulin (IgG)-like fold, which shows structural homology to the
corresponding domains in SdrD and UafA proteins of the microbial surface
component recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMMs) family. A
single B domain shares structural similarity with the corresponding
domain of Sdr proteins. The R region is rich in PKD repeats, while the
C-terminal contains a non-canonical LVNTG cell wall sorting motif. The
cna gene was predominantly detected in G. vaginalis isolates but was
absent in other commonly identified Gardnerella species isolates. The
recombinant Grd Cna protein binds dose-dependently to human fibrinogen
but does not interact with fibronectin or collagen types I, III, or IV.
Cna-positive G. vaginalis cells adhered to immobilized fibrinogen;
however, recombinant Cna did not inhibit this binding, suggesting that
Cna may not be a major adhesin mediating G. vaginalis adherence to this
ECM component.</p>

<p>date: 2025-05-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global health challenge, with timely and
accurate diagnosis being critical for effective disease management and
control. Recent advancements in the field of TB diagnostics have focused
on the identification and utilization of blood-based biomarkers,
offering a non-invasive, rapid, and scalable approach to disease
detection. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest
progress in blood-based biomarkers for TB, highlighting their potential
to revolutionize diagnostic strategies. Furthermore, we explore emerging
technologies such as NGS, PET-CT, Xpert and line probe assays, which
have enhanced the sensitivity, specificity, and accessibility of
biomarker-based diagnostics. The integration of artificial intelligence
(AI) and machine learning (ML) in biomarker analysis is also examined,
showcasing its potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and predictive
capabilities. This review underscores the need for multidisciplinary
collaboration and continued innovation to translate these promising
technologies into practical, point-of-care solutions. By addressing
these challenges, blood-based biomarkers and emerging technologies hold
the potential to significantly improve TB diagnosis, ultimately
contributing to global efforts to eradicate this devastating
disease.</p>

profiling from biopsied tissues in complex infections: a diagnostic and
prognostic analysis through metagenomic next-generation sequencing</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundInfectious diseases that require tissue biopsy are usually
more difficult to diagnose through conventional microbiological tests
(CMT), and knowledge of the infection microbiota pattern from biopsied
tissues remains incomplete. Our study aimed to investigate the
diagnostic and prognostic value of metagenomic next-generation
sequencing (mNGS), characterize the microbiota profile from biopsied
tissues, and examine its relationship with clinical outcomes.MethodsThis
retrospective cohort study included 110 patients who underwent tissue
biopsy and sent both mNGS and CMT due to suspected complex infection.
Microbiota patterns were illustrated via unsupervised hierarchical
clustering analysis. Multivariate regression analysis was used to
investigate the effect measures.ResultsThe sensitivity of mNGS was
significantly higher than that of CMT regarding bacteria (87.23% vs
40.43%, P=0.01), viruses (100% vs 5.56%, P&lt;0.001), and fungi (87.5%
vs 28.6%, P=0.04). Polymicrobial infection accounted for 45.2% (33/73)
of the infection samples. In skeletal articular biopsied tissues,
Staphylococcus presented the highest mean abundance among different
species of bacteria (21.2% of all bacterial reads, standard deviation
(SD) 38.9). Anaerobic bacteria (24.0%, SD 25.9) represented the most
common bacteria in biopsied tissue from the lung or mediastinum. The
presence of gram-negative bacteria (adjusted OR 5.21, 95% CI 1.39–19.43,
P=0.01), Enterobacteriaceae (adjusted OR 5.71, 95% CI 1.17–28.03,
P=0.03) and Staphylococcus (adjusted OR 8.64, 95% CI 1.95–38.34,
P=0.005) was associated with an increased risk of treatment failure.
Early mNGS sampling within 7 days after admission was associated with a
significantly decreased risk of all-cause mortality (HR 0.18, 95% CI
0.04–0.94; P=0.04), treatment failure (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.05–0.66;
P=0.01), and increased probability of clinical resolution (OR 3.03, 95%
CI 1.24–7.40; P=0.01).ConclusionmNGS demonstrates significant diagnostic
and prognostic efficacy in patients undergoing tissue biopsy for
suspected complex infections. The presence of Gram-negative bacteria,
Enterobacteriaceae, and Staphylococcus is associated with a higher
probability of treatment failure, which underscores the advantage of
using mNGS to guide more aggressive antibiotic strategies.</p>

of the diversity and function of the microbiota in infected root canals
of type 2 diabetes mellitus with apical periodontitis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>PurposeThis study aimed to compare the compositional differences and
functions of microbial communities in infected root canals of teeth with
apical periodontitis (AP) and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) using
16S rDNA sequencing.MethodsEighteen participants were categorized into
two groups based on their health conditions: AP and AP complicated with
T2DM (APDM). Infected root canal microbiota was clinically collected for
16S rDNA sequencing. Subsequent statistical and bioinformatics analyses
were conducted after sequencing by NovaSeq, encompassing diversity
analysis, intergroup difference analysis, and functional prediction
analysis.ResultsThe core microbiome of root canal microorganisms was
similar in the two groups, which mainly consisted of Bacteroidota,
Firmicutes, Synergistota, Actinobacteriota, Proteobacteria,
Fusobacteriota, Spirochaetota. The root canals of the affected teeth of
APDM had significantly higher abundance of Olsenella_uli,
Peptostreptococcaceae_bacterium _oral_taxon_113_str_W5053, W5053,
Pyramidobacter_piscolen, Pyramidobacte, Synergistaceae, Synergistales
was significantly higher than AP group (P&lt;0.05). Under the condition
of T2DM, root canal microbial metabolism was predominantly enriched
towards functions of the phosphotransferase system, ABC system, amino
acid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism.ConclusionThe microbial
community in the infected root canals of APDM showed similarities to AP
yet exhibited differences in certain species and microbial
functions.</p>

id="characterization-of-naegleria-fowleri-from-two-human-cases-insights-into-its-excretionsecretion-products">Characterization
of Naegleria fowleri from two human cases: insights into its
excretion/secretion products</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionNaegleria fowleri is the etiologic agent of primary acute
meningoencephalitis (PAM). Although this amoeba is commonly found in
water and soil, reports of infections are rare; problems with diagnosis
probably contribute to underestimation. Moreover, information regarding
the pathogenicity of this species is still lacking. Costa Rica reported
the first three cases of PAM during 2020; from these, two N. fowleri
isolates were recovered. The aim of this study was to characterize and
compare these isolates, focusing in excretion/secretion
products.MethodsAnalyses of protein profiles by silver staining and
protease activity assays were performed to characterize whole protein
extracts and conditioned media from isolates. Proteomic analyses of
excretion/secretion products, including extracellular vesicles (EVs),
were performed, and cytopathic effect and drug susceptibility tests were
also compared between isolates.ResultsResults obtained were similar for
both isolates. Patterns of multiple bands were observed in each isolate
after silver staining. Proteomics analyses revealed a total of 88 and 62
non-redundant proteins as part of the cargo of EVs secreted by
trophozoites of N. fowleri Guanacaste and N. fowleri Limón, while
conditioned media results revealed 34 and 17 non-redundant proteins,
respectively; hydrolase activity and actin filament binding were part of
the most represented gene ontology terms in EVs and conditioned media.
Regarding drug susceptibility assays, no statistically significant
differences were identified. On the other hand, although protease
activity resulted very similar with substrate buffer at pH 8.5, only N.
fowleri Limón showed activity between 40 and 70 kDa at pH 5.0; in
contrast, a more rapid cytopathic effect was observed when incubating
Vero cells with N. fowleri Guanacaste.DiscussionComparative analyses of
different N. fowleri isolates, supported by their remarkable genomic
heterogeneity that could be reflected in different metabolic
repertoires, are key to understanding virulence and pathogenicity of
this amoeba, and could help to explain whether different isolates differ
in the severity or course of PAM.</p>

id="impaired-k48-polyubiquitination-downmodulates-mouse-norovirus-propagation">Impaired
K48-polyubiquitination downmodulates mouse norovirus propagation</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionNoroviruses are small non-enveloped, single stranded
positive-sense RNA viruses that belong to the family Caliciviridae. They
are highly contagious and resistant to multiple detergents and are the
infectious agents in the majority of viral gastroenteritis in adults.
Due to a lack of approved preventive or curative therapy options,
intensive research effort is ongoing to better understand the
pathogenesis mechanisms of noroviruses.MethodsIn this study, using the
persistent murine norovirus S99 strain (MNoV_S99), we have investigated
the role in the regulation of anti-noroviral responses of
ubiquitination, a post-translational modification that covalently adds
one or multiple ubiquitin molecules onto lysine residues of target
proteins. To that end, we have first generated RAW264.7 cells
overexpressing YFP-Ubiquitin_WT, _K29R, _K48R or_K63R constructs. All
non-WT constructs encode a ubiquitin fusion protein with one lysine
mutated into an arginine residue, thus preventing the formation of the
K29-, K48- or K63-dependent polyubiquitin chains
respectively.ResultsUpon infection of these cells with MNoV_S99, we
unexpectedly observed that only cells expressing the YFP-Ubiquitin_K48R
protein showed a significantly impaired expression of several viral
markers: NS5, NS7, VP1 and the replication intermediate dsRNA.
Consequently, the number of viral genome copies or viral titers were
also significantly decreased in the YFP-Ubiquitin_K48R cells compared to
the YFP-Ubiquitin_WT cells. This negative regulation cannot be explained
by perturbed viral entry, but rather a constitutive hypersecretion of
the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF and downstream upregulation of IκBα
phosphorylation and the subsequent NF-κB nuclear
translocation.ConclusionOverall, these consequences combined impose a
non-permissive environment for MNoV_S99 replication and propagation.</p>

learning-based text mining for cutaneous myiasis and potential value of
an accidental maggot therapy for complicated skin and soft tissue
infection with sepsis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundCutaneous myiasis, one of the most frequently diagnosed
myiasis types, is defined as skin or soft tissue on a living host
infested by dipterous larvae (maggots). However, bibliometric analysis
of this disease remains sparse. Machine learning techniques and updated
publications provide an opportunity for such an investigation.Materials
and methodsAll the studies were retrieved from PubMed and were processed
using R software in the bibliometric analysis and latent Dirichlet
allocation (LDA) topic modeling. Furthermore, the clinical management of
two diabetes patients with serious soft tissue infection-associated
sepsis was analyzed.ResultsA total of 211 results were retrieved and 50
topics relevant to cutaneous myiasis were determined by the LDA
algorithm. The topics of uncommon fly species, nasal infestation, and
physician discussion of cutaneous myiasis were consistently common over
the last 20 years. Case report remains one of the key features in
myiasis. Four major clusters were identified, i.e., case report related,
disease type and development, travel in the tropics, and skin disease.
To further delve into clinical practice, the clinical features of two
patients with soft tissue infection-related sepsis were demonstrated,
and a distinct beneficial role of myiasis was found. The levels of white
blood cell, blood glucose, and C-reactive protein in the case with
cutaneous myiasis were more stable than the other case without cutaneous
myiasis but with sepsis shock.ConclusionMaggot debridement therapy may
be a promising treatment and beneficial for soft tissue
infection-related sepsis. The model analysis of maggot therapy and its
clinical advantages shows increasing research value and possible
application in future clinical practice.</p>

clinical investigation and rabbit model study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundHepatitis E virus (HEV)-associated renal injury is mainly
reported in immunocompromised patients. Here we investigated
HEV-associated renal injury in non-immunocompromised acute hepatitis E
(AHE) patients and rabbits.MethodsA total of 35 non-immunocompromised
AHE patients were tested for kidney function parameters and HEV markers.
HEV3- and HEV4-infected rabbits were tested for alanine
aminotransferase, creatinine (Cr), and HEV markers. HEV-associated renal
injury and renal HEV replication were analyzed by histopathology and
RT-qPCR.ResultsThe non-immunocompromised AHE patients all showed normal
serum Cr, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and urine acid (UA). However, 25%
of non-immunocompromised AHE patients showed proteinuria. In the rabbit
model, HEV replication was observed in kidney tissues. The HEV-infected
rabbits showed a transient elevated Cr level. Renal injury, including
focal lymphocytic infiltration and tubular protein casts, was observed
in rabbits across acute, recovery, and chronic phases of HEV
infection.ConclusionsProteinuria is not uncommon in
non-immunocompromised AHE patients, indicating that HEV infection
affects the kidney. We further proved that HEV can cause renal injury in
a rabbit model.</p>

relationship between gut microbiome and human diseases: mechanisms,
predisposing factors and potential intervention</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The complex interrelation of gut microbiota with human health
underlines the profound influence this microbial ecosystem has on
mechanisms of disease and wellness. The gut microbiome profoundly
impacts various human diseases, encompassing gastrointestinal disorders,
metabolic disorders, neurological disorders, and immune-related
diseases. Gastrointestinal disorders are closely linked to microbial
imbalances in the gut. Metabolic disorders, including obesity and type 2
diabetes, are influenced by the gut microbiota’s role in energy
regulation and glucose metabolism. Furthermore, the gut-brain axis
highlights the correlation between gut microbiota and neurological
conditions such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Moreover, the gut
microbiome assumes a pivotal function in regulating the immune system,
whereby dysbiosis is implicated in developing immunological-related
ailments, including allergies and autoimmune disorders. Predisposing
factors, including diet, medicines, lifestyle, and environmental
influences, are described as having an important role in the composition
of the gut microbiome. By understanding these factors, we can get
valuable insights into how to intervene to reduce the chances of a
disease. Current interventions, including probiotics, prebiotics, fecal
microbiota transplants, and lifestyle modification, show promise, but
there are still challenges and unanswered questions in this evolving
field that may lead to improvements. This review interrelates the
complicated gut microbiome with various human diseases, mechanisms,
predisposing factors, and potential interventions.</p>

adaptation to fluconazole: comparative insights into tolerance and
resistance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionAntifungal resistance and tolerance are distinct
responses exhibited by fungi when exposed to drugs. While considerable
research has focused on azole tolerance in the human pathogen Candida
albicans, studies in other fungal species remain limited.ObjectiveThis
study aims to conduct a comparative investigation of the adaptation of
the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae and C. albicans to
fluconazole in vitro.MethodsWe performed experiments using laboratory
strains of S. cerevisiae and C. albicans to evaluate their fluconazole
tolerance and resistance under varying temperature conditions. High
concentrations of fluconazole were administered, and subsequent changes
in fungal phenotypes were analyzed through techniques such as
transcriptome analysis and monitoring of petite formation.ResultsOur
results revealed that fluconazole tolerance is present in wild-type
strains of S. cerevisiae and is influenced by temperature, albeit in a
manner opposite to that observed in C. albicans. Importantly, when
subjected to high concentrations of fluconazole, S. cerevisiae strains
developed resistance without displaying tolerance; all resistant
adaptors identified were petites. Chemical induction of petite formation
led to an increase in resistance accompanied by a decrease in
tolerance.ConclusionTranscriptome analysis indicated that petites
up-regulated efflux mechanisms while down-regulating most ERG genes.
This suggests that, unlike petite-negative C. albicans, petite-positive
S. cerevisiae swiftly transitions to a petite phenotype upon exposure to
fluconazole, resulting in enhanced resistance but diminished tolerance.
This evolutionary divergence emphasizes the need for additional studies
on fluconazole tolerance in other pathogenic fungi.</p>

of multidrug-resistant bacteria and their molecular mechanisms found in
small animal veterinary practices in Portugal</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionIntensive medical care provided in companion animal
practices carries the potential risk of selecting and disseminating
multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). However, data on infection,
prevention and control standards specific to small animal veterinary
practices (SAVPs) remains limited. The goal of our work was to evaluate
the environmental contamination and staff carriage by MDROs in
veterinary practices across Portugal.MethodsFourteen SAVPs were
enrolled. Environmental samples were collected from critical areas such
as operating room, wards and pre-operative area. Veterinary team members
voluntarily gave nasal, hand and rectal swabs. All samples were screened
for the presence of, including extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL)-
and carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria and
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. (MRS). Whole-genome sequencing
was performed for carbapenem resistant strains.ResultsEnvironmental
evaluation by surface swabs revealed that 6.5% (n=32/490) were
contaminated with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.
OXA-23-producing Acinetobacter spp. (n=5) and IMP-8-producing
Pseudomonas juntendi (n=2) strains were described on different locations
of different SAVPs. Moreover, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n=12) and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=3) strains were also found on multiple
surfaces of different SAVPs. Three human samples (two rectal, one hand)
had carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa strains by OprD mutations, while
S. maltophilia strains were recovered from four samples (two rectal, two
hands). One nasal swab was positive for carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
pneumoniae ST11. Only one SAVP surface was positive for the newly typed
for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ST9220-II. MRSA
nasal carriage was found in 14% of samples (n=9/64), with an equal
prevalence of ST22-IV and ST8-VI. As for hand samples, MRSA was present
in 10.7% (n=4/38), with a predominance of ST8-VI.DiscussionThese
emerging data indicate that SAVPs may significantly contribute to the
dissemination of MDROs. To address this, rigorous infection, prevention
and control (IPC) measures should be implemented, alongside educational
workshops directed to all veterinary staff as well as to veterinary and
nursing students.</p>

id="apoptosis-inhibitor-of-macrophage-suppress-immune-responses-via-il-10-production-and-delay-bacterial-clearance-in-mycobacterium-avium-infection">Apoptosis
inhibitor of macrophage suppress immune responses via IL-10 production
and delay bacterial clearance in Mycobacterium avium infection</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-05, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Non-tuberculous mycobacteria infections, including Mycobacterium
avium, are increasingly recognized as a growing public health concern,
even among immunocompetent individuals. These infections are a
significant cause of chronic pulmonary disease, and they are
characterized by the formation of foamy macrophages (FMs) that
facilitate bacterial persistence. Previously, we reported that apoptosis
inhibitor of macrophage (AIM), a protein secreted by macrophages,
promotes lipid droplet accumulation in M. avium-infected macrophages.
However, the precise role of AIM in modulating immune responses remains
unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the effect of AIM on FM
formation, bacterial burden, and immune response in M. avium-infected
mice by comparing AIM knockout (KO) mice with wild-type mice.
Histological analysis revealed a reduction in FM formation in AIM KO
mice, accompanied by decreased lipid droplet accumulation and altered
expression of lipid metabolism-related genes. Furthermore, AIM KO mice
exhibited a reduced bacterial load in the lungs, highlighting decreased
cytokine production, including IL-1β, compared to wild-type mice. In
addition, the analysis of the immune cells of AIM KO mice using flow
cytometry revealed an increase in M1 macrophages and IFN-γ-producing T
cells, as well as a decrease in M2 macrophages and interleukin 10
(IL-10)-producing T cells. The reduced expression of CD36 and PD-L1 in
macrophages from AIM KO mice further supports the skewing toward an M1
phenotype. In vitro experiments with bone marrow-derived macrophages
(BMDMs) confirmed reduced bacterial growth and lipid droplet formation
in AIM KO BMDMs, which was restored by AIM and IL-10 treatment. These
findings suggest that AIM contributes to the promotion of FM formation
by establishing an immunosuppressive environment that promotes the
establishment of M. avium through IL-10 production.</p>
