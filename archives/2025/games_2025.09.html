<p>Each week on Polygon, we round up the most notable new releases to

<p>Slaying hundreds of demons is cool, but slaying hundreds of demons 20
minutes after creating your character is a little ridiculous for a
loot-based action RPG. You want to feel each step as you ascend in
power. Otherwise, there’s no point in chasing more loot. For many
players, this is the core problem with Diablo […]</p>

<p>Dragon is an element in Monster Hunter Wilds that can appear on
weapons as a type of damage you can deal, and on armor as a type of
damage you can resist. But saying “this does Dragon damage” isn’t
exactly as straightforward as saying, for instance, “this deals Fire
damage.” In this Monster Hunter Wilds […]</p>

<p>There are few firm rules in comics reading, but Never trust an
inter-brand tie-in comic could be one of them. The business interests
are too involved to expect big creative swings, the licenses too

a book is genuinely good, a panel of it […]</p>

<p>Atomfall, the new game from Sniper Elite developer (and 2000 AD

an imagined version of the 1960s. It’s a world of stark mountains,

<p>The newest expansion for The Sims 4 is a game changer, allowing Sims

<p>The only thing PC Monster Hunter Wilds players want more than fully

<p>Hunter Symbols are a resource needed to craft endgame armor and
weapons in Monster Hunter Wilds. “Endgame” is the keyword here, as
gathering Hunter Symbols requires access to tempered monsters, which
become progressively available during the High Rank story chapters.
Furthermore, the rarity of the resource is tied to the star-difficulty
of each hunt. Our […]</p>
