Mesoscale Discussion 1756
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0319 PM CDT Tue Jul 22 2025

Areas affected...portions of southeast North Dakota and northeast
South Dakota

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 222019Z - 222215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Strong to severe thunderstorms are possible into early
evening. Hail and strong gusts may occur with stronger storms.

DISCUSSION...Scattered thunderstorms have developed this afternoon
within the post-outflow airmass. While early day convection and
cloud cover have impacted the airmass to some degree, some recovery
is apparent as temperatures have warmed into the upper 70s to low
80s and dewpoints have been maintained in the upper 60s to low 70s.
As a result, capping is eroding, and MLCAPE has increased to
1000-2000 J/kg. Ongoing storms may be somewhat elevated initially,
but could become surface-based with time. Effective shear magnitudes
greater than 40 kt and steep midlevel lapse rates suggests robust
updrafts supporting isolated large hail and strong/severe gusts will
be possible. Given the influence of outflow and modification of the
airmass from morning convection, convective evolution remains
somewhat uncertain. Portions of the area may eventually need a
severe thunderstorm watch, but timing and location is uncertain.

Mesoscale Discussion 1755
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0300 PM CDT Tue Jul 22 2025

Areas affected...northern WY into southeast MT

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 222000Z - 222200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms are possible
across parts of southern Montana and northern Wyoming this afternoon
and evening.

DISCUSSION...Occasionally robust thunderstorms have developed over
higher terrain in portions of southern MT and northern WY. Weak
inhibition remains downstream over the adjacent high Plains, but
additional heating and increasing ascent should allow for storms to
become sustained further from the terrain with time into late
afternoon. Regional VWP data shows elongated, straight hodographs
amid steep midlevel lapse rates. While instability is muted due to
the drier, post-frontal low-level airmass, MLCAPE will still be
sufficient to sustain updrafts. Isolated strong to severe
thunderstorms posing a risk for hail (possibly up to 2 inches,
especially over far southeast MT) will be possible over the next
several hours. Trends will be monitored and a severe thunderstorm
watch may be needed for parts of the discussion area later this
afternoon.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Tue Jul 22 2025

Valid 222000Z - 231200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PARTS OF THE
NORTHERN PLAINS INTO THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms will be possible over parts of the
northern Plains into the upper Mississippi Valley this afternoon
into tonight.

...20z Update...
Minor updates were made to the D1 Convective Outlook to reduce the
Marginal Risk area across North Dakota into northern Minnesota where
the front has shifted southward with influence from morning
convection. 

Otherwise, the Slight Risk across the northern Plains into the upper
Midwest remains on track. There continues to remain some uncertainty
on what the corridor for greater wind risk will be this evening.
Cloud cover remains across much of the Slight Risk area. It is
mostly clear across southern South Dakota into Wyoming, where
temperatures are warming. Thunderstorm activity has begun across the
high terrain in Montana and Wyoming. See the previous discussion
below for more information.

..Thornton.. 07/22/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1130 AM CDT Tue Jul 22 2025/

...Northern Plains into the Upper Mississippi Valley...
Visible-satellite imagery late this morning shows extensive cloud
debris and convective outflow from ongoing and early morning
shower/thunderstorm activity.  A composite outflow/front is draped
from the ND/MN Red River Valley west-southwestward into northwest
SD, with another frontal segment extending into northern WY. Weak to
neutral height rises across the northern Plains this afternoon will
likely not support a northward oscillation of the boundary into
southwest ND.  

A belt of moderate to strong southwesterly 500-mb flow overhead the
north-central Rockies and adjacent plains will be downstream of a
larger-scale trough pivoting east across the northern Rockies
through tonight.  In agreement with earlier forecast thinking, it
appears probable that diurnal storms will favor the general area of
northern WY/southern MT. This region will generally be post-frontal,
but steep mid-level lapse rates and a modestly moist low-level
airmass should still aid in the development of at least weak
instability.  Strong deep-layer shear should support supercells
initially, with associated threat for large to perhaps isolated very
large hail. Some potential should exist for this convection to grow
upscale this evening across parts of the Dakotas and pose a greater
threat for severe/damaging winds overnight. But, uncertainty remains
high regarding the placement of this possible cluster, and whether
it will remain surface-based or elevated.

Farther east into the upper MS Valley, it appears less likely that
robust convection will develop before this evening due to the
stabilizing influence of the ongoing morning activity. If
thunderstorms can develop later, most short-term guidance continues
to suggest that sufficient airmass recovery will occur to support
severe convection with mainly a hail/wind threat.  Some diurnal
hail/wind threat may develop across IA in association with the lower
MO Valley MCV.  Uncertainty remains high regarding this scenario.

...Central High Plains...
Scattered to numerous high-based thunderstorms should develop this
afternoon along/near the surface lee trough extending southward
across the central High Plains. While low/mid-level flow and
deep-layer shear are all expected to remain weak today across this
region due to closer proximity to the upper ridge, heating will
contribute to the development of steep 0-3 km lapse rates.  Severe
gusts will be the primary hazard. 

...Southeast...
A weak cold front will shift southward today across parts of GA/SC.
A rather moist low-level airmass will be in place ahead of the
front, with daytime heating encouraging the development of moderate
to locally strong instability through the afternoon. Scattered
thunderstorms that develop along/ahead of the front, and along
various sea breeze circulations, may be capable of producing
occasional damaging winds, even though shear will remain weak.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0224 PM CDT Tue Jul 22 2025

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF
THE UPPER MIDWEST AND GREAT LAKES...AND CENTERED ACROSS THE FRONT
RANGE....

...SUMMARY...
A few clusters of severe thunderstorms are possible from parts of
the Upper Midwest into the Great Lakes region Thursday, with
damaging wind gust potential. Areas of strong to damaging gusts may
also occur from southeast Wyoming across the Front Range and into
northeast New Mexico.

...From IA/WI to Lower MI/Lower Great Lakes...
A weak shortwave trough will move across the area, with midlevel
winds to around 30 kt as far south as northern IL/IN. Moderate
instability is forecast to develop ahead of a cold front, with
storms developing from eastern IA into northern Lower MI between
18-21Z. Deep-layer means winds of 25-35 kt along with heating of the
moist air mass should result in scattered strong to damaging gusts
during the afternoon. A few strong storms could persist from the Mid
MS Valley toward western PA overnight as westerly 850 mb winds
persist within the deeper theta-e plume, though likely not severe.

...Eastern WY, CO, and northeast NM...
Beneath weak westerlies aloft, low-level moisture will gradually
spread westward across the High Plains as surface winds veer to
east/southeast during the afternoon. Temperatures aloft will remain
relatively cool, resulting in steep lapse rates overall. Models
indicate rather significant overall storm coverage from afternoon
through evening, developing over the high terrain and spreading into
the Plains. Given MUCAPE of 1500-2000 J/kg, strong gusts will be
possible, in addition to marginal hail.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0216 PM CDT Tue Jul 22 2025

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...Update...
A very subtle adjustment was made to the Isolated Dry Thunderstorm
area for Wednesday (extended slightly southward to include more of
the Sierra Crest). The previous discussion remains valid. Please see
below for additional details.

..Barnes.. 07/22/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0129 AM CDT Tue Jul 22 2025/

...Synopsis...
Winds across the Great Basin will continue to weaken on Wednesday as
the stronger upper-level winds depart into the northern Rockies and
a weak cutoff low sits off the central California coast. This upper
low will draw marginally greater mid-level moisture northward and
provide weak lift. Isolated thunderstorms are possible from parts of
northern California into far northwest/north-central Nevada near the
Sierra Crest. A few storms may remain dry, though slow storm motions
could allow some wetting rainfall locally. Given the state of fuels
in these areas, some potential for new ignitions exists.

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM UPPER
MICHIGAN SOUTHWESTWARD TO NEBRASKA...

...SUMMARY...
Organizing clusters of storms posing a risk for severe wind are
possible across parts of the middle Missouri Valley and Upper
Midwest into adjacent portions of the Great Lakes region Wednesday
through Wednesday night.

...Synopsis...
An upper high will remain over parts of the Southeast and Mid
Atlantic on Wednesday, with ridge axis shifting east from the Upper
Great Lakes into the Northeast as a low-amplitude shortwave trough
moves across the northern Plains. This wave will bring cooling aloft
from the northern Plains toward the Upper Great Lakes, with lift
focused near a surface low moving from southern MN toward Lake
Superior. A cold front will extend southwestward from the low,
extending from Upper MI into KS by 12Z Thursday. Persistent
south/southwest 850 mb winds across the Plains will aid boundary
layer mixing and northward transport of moisture toward the frontal
zone. Enhanced low-level shear may develop near the warm front as it
moves across northern WI into western Upper MI. Well behind the cold
front, veering surface winds into the northern High Plains will lead
to a destabilizing air mass late in the day.

...Upper MI to NE...
Storms are forecast to be ongoing along or just behind the cold
front from northern SD into northwest MN Wednesday morning, with
minimal wind risk. Area of heating and destabilization ahead of the
front and outflows will then support numerous storms along the
boundary from western KS/central NE northeastward into MN/WI/Upper
MI, with one or more lines or MCSs producing severe gusts. Depending
on air mass quality near the warm front across northern WI into the
western MI Upper Peninsula, enhanced SRH could yield a tornadic
storm or two.

...Central to northern High Plains...
Southeast surface winds beneath modest west to northwest flow aloft
will lead to elongated hodographs sufficient to sustain
southeastward-moving cells capable of hail. Lapse rates aloft will
not be particularly steep, but widely scattered instances of 1.00"
hail appear likely from eastern WY to the Front Range during the
late afternoon into early evening.

Valid 221630Z - 231200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN PLAINS INTO THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms will be possible over parts of the
northern Plains into the upper Mississippi Valley this afternoon
into tonight.

...Northern Plains into the Upper Mississippi Valley...
Visible-satellite imagery late this morning shows extensive cloud
debris and convective outflow from ongoing and early morning
shower/thunderstorm activity.  A composite outflow/front is draped
from the ND/MN Red River Valley west-southwestward into northwest
SD, with another frontal segment extending into northern WY. Weak to
neutral height rises across the northern Plains this afternoon will
likely not support a northward oscillation of the boundary into
southwest ND.  

A belt of moderate to strong southwesterly 500-mb flow overhead the
north-central Rockies and adjacent plains will be downstream of a
larger-scale trough pivoting east across the northern Rockies
through tonight.  In agreement with earlier forecast thinking, it
appears probable that diurnal storms will favor the general area of
northern WY/southern MT. This region will generally be post-frontal,
but steep mid-level lapse rates and a modestly moist low-level
airmass should still aid in the development of at least weak
instability.  Strong deep-layer shear should support supercells
initially, with associated threat for large to perhaps isolated very
large hail. Some potential should exist for this convection to grow
upscale this evening across parts of the Dakotas and pose a greater
threat for severe/damaging winds overnight. But, uncertainty remains
high regarding the placement of this possible cluster, and whether
it will remain surface-based or elevated.

Farther east into the upper MS Valley, it appears less likely that
robust convection will develop before this evening due to the
stabilizing influence of the ongoing morning activity. If
thunderstorms can develop later, most short-term guidance continues
to suggest that sufficient airmass recovery will occur to support
severe convection with mainly a hail/wind threat.  Some diurnal
hail/wind threat may develop across IA in association with the lower
MO Valley MCV.  Uncertainty remains high regarding this scenario.

...Central High Plains...
Scattered to numerous high-based thunderstorms should develop this
afternoon along/near the surface lee trough extending southward
across the central High Plains. While low/mid-level flow and
deep-layer shear are all expected to remain weak today across this
region due to closer proximity to the upper ridge, heating will
contribute to the development of steep 0-3 km lapse rates.  Severe
gusts will be the primary hazard. 

...Southeast...
A weak cold front will shift southward today across parts of GA/SC.
A rather moist low-level airmass will be in place ahead of the
front, with daytime heating encouraging the development of moderate
to locally strong instability through the afternoon. Scattered
thunderstorms that develop along/ahead of the front, and along
various sea breeze circulations, may be capable of producing
occasional damaging winds, even though shear will remain weak.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1132 AM CDT Tue Jul 22 2025

Valid 221700Z - 231200Z

...Update...
Increasing west-southwesterly winds are expected near and west of
the upper Snake River of ID this afternoon and evening. Although
relative humidity will likely remain just above critical thresholds
of 15 percent, sustained wind speeds at or above 20 mph should
persist for a few hours across receptive fuels. Therefore, an
additional small Elevated area has been included in the forecast for
today for the aforementioned region. The rest of the forecast
remains valid and accurate for NV. Please see the previous
discussion for details pertaining to that region.

..Barnes.. 07/22/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0128 AM CDT Tue Jul 22 2025/

...Synopsis...
While mid-level winds will steadily weaken across the Great Basin
today, enough flow across the Sierra and strong heating in Nevada
will promote a weak surface trough in northern Nevada. This feature
will drive downslope winds into parts of southern and central
Nevada. Winds around 15 to perhaps 20 mph will occur in a confined
zone. RH will fall to 10-15% by the afternoon. Local, marginally
critical conditions may occur very briefly as well. A few hours of
elevated fire weather is expected.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN PLAINS INTO THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms will be possible over parts of the
northern Plains into the upper Mississippi Valley later today into
tonight.

...Synopsis...
Large-scale upper ridging will remain anchored over the MS Valley
and Southeast today. A positively tilted upper trough will persist
over the Northwest and northern Rockies, with enhanced southwesterly
mid-level flow continuing though the period over the northern
Plains. At the surface, a weak low is forecast to gradually develop
eastward across western/central SD by this evening, with a lee
trough extending southward from this low across the central High
Plains. A convectively reinforced boundary extending northeastward
from the surface low into northern MN may act as a focus for robust
thunderstorm development later today.

...Northern Plains into the Upper Mississippi Valley...
Extensive convective overturning has occurred overnight across the
northern Plains into parts of MN, with scattered to numerous
thunderstorms generally remaining sub-severe while tracking
east-northeastward along/north of the surface front. This activity
has been aided by a southerly low-level jet across the Plains, which
is forecast to gradually weaken though midday. While isolated hail
or strong to severe gusts may occur with ongoing thunderstorms, the
net effect of this convection may be to displace the surface
boundary farther south than most guidance indicates. In the wake of
this early day convection and associated weak mid-level shortwave
trough, heights are forecast to remain neutral or even rise slightly
through the day across much of ND/SD into MN. This weak/nebulous
large-scale forcing casts considerable uncertainty regarding
convective development with eastward extent across the Dakotas into
MN this afternoon and evening.

Even so, it does appear probable that thunderstorms will once again
form along/near the Bighorns in northern WY/southern MT, as a weak
embedded mid-level perturbation and related jet overspread the
northern High Plains. This region will generally be post-frontal,
but steep mid-level lapse rates combined with diurnal heating of the
modestly moist low-level airmass should still aid in the development
of at least weak instability by the time convection initiates this
afternoon. Strong deep-layer shear should support supercells
initially, with associated threat for large to perhaps isolated very
large hail. Some potential should exist for this convection to grow
upscale this evening across parts of the Dakotas and pose a greater
threat for severe/damaging winds overnight. But, uncertainty remains
high regarding the placement of this possible cluster, and whether
it will remain surface-based or elevated.

Farther east into the upper MS Valley, it appears less likely that
robust convection will develop before this evening due to the
stabilizing influence of the ongoing morning activity. If
thunderstorms can develop later, most short-term guidance continues
to suggest that sufficient airmass recovery will occur to support
severe convection with mainly a hail/wind threat. Sufficient
low-level shear should also be present near the front to support
some risk for a tornado. This activity would probably remain tied
close the surface boundary, with less potential for a
forward-propagating MCS into central/southern MN. Accordingly, have
trimmed the southern extent of the Slight Risk in MN. Finally, a MCV
related to extensive convection in KS yesterday is forecast to
develop northeastward across IA this afternoon/evening. Sufficient
instability and shear should be present with this feature to support
an isolated threat for severe thunderstorms, assuming convection can
develop and persist.

...Central High Plains...
Scattered to numerous high-based thunderstorms should develop this
afternoon along/near the surface lee trough extending southward
across the central High Plains. While low/mid-level flow and
deep-layer shear are all expected to remain weak today across this
region due to closer proximity to the upper ridge, low-level lapse
rates should become steepened through the afternoon and early
evening with ample daytime heating. Given the deeply mixed boundary
layer forecast, any of this high-based convection could produce
occasional strong to severe wind gusts. Have therefore expanded the
Marginal Risk southward a bit into eastern CO and western KS to
account for this potential.

...Southeast...
A weak cold front will shift southward today across parts of GA/SC.
A rather moist low-level airmass will be in place ahead of the
front, with daytime heating encouraging the development of moderate
to locally strong instability through the afternoon. Scattered
thunderstorms that develop along/ahead of the front, and along
various sea breeze circulations, may be capable of producing
occasional damaging winds, even though shear will remain weak.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0350 AM CDT Tue Jul 22 2025

Valid 251200Z - 301200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Medium-range guidance suggests that strongest destabilization
(including large potential instability) by next weekend into early
next week will become focused once again from the lee of the
northern U.S. Rockies across and northeast of the middle and lower
Missouri Valley into Upper Midwest.  This is forecast to be
supported by seasonably high boundary-layer moisture content, 
beneath a plume of steepening mid-level lapse rates near the
southwestern periphery of an increasingly northwesterly regime,
between building mid-level ridging along/east of the Rockies and
another significant low digging southeast of the central Canadian
Arctic latitudes through Hudson Bay.  

By next Sunday into Monday, it appears possible that this
environment could become supportive of the evolution of one or two
organizing, east-southeastward propagating convective systems. 
However, the forcing for any such development remains unclear, and
probably will be tied to sub-synoptic perturbations with very low
predictability at this extended range.

Mesoscale Discussion 1738
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0241 PM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Areas affected...south-central South Dakota across western Nebraska
and toward northwest Kansas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 201941Z - 202215Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Scattered severe storms appear likely later this afternoon
from south-central SD across west-central NE and toward northwest
KS. A few cells may produce large hail, with locally damaging gusts.
A tornado is possible over southern SD into far northern NE after
23Z. A portion of the area may require a watch.

DISCUSSION...Surface map shows low pressure extending from southwest
SD across western NE and into the CO/KS border area, with strong
heating. This trough will continue to deepen, and sufficient
convergence within the uncapped air mass should allow for widely
scattered storms to develop late this afternoon.

Of particular note is the warm front area which currently curls
northwestward out of northern NE and into south-central SD. Here,
heating is occurring on the cool side of the boundary, where
dewpoints remain above 70 F and low-level shear is enhanced. Any
supercell that develops here, most likely after 23Z, could be
tornadic at times, and produce very large hail as it proceeds
southeastward, aided by a modest evening low-level jet.

Farther south into the deeper/heated air mass, higher based storms
are expected, and overall shear is weaker as well. However, steep
lapse rates will favor locally severe gusts, and even some hail in
the early and robust formation stages.

Mesoscale Discussion 1737

0135 PM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Areas affected...southern Indiana and Ohio...northern Kentucky

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 201835Z - 202130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A few strong storms producing locally damaging gusts
cannot be ruled out later this afternoon from southern Indiana
across southern Ohio and northeast Kentucky.

DISCUSSION...An MCV continues to move rapidly eastward across
northern IN, well north of a stalled front draped across southern
IL/IN and southwest OH. Meanwhile, a very moist air mass remains
near this boundary, with heating occurring upstream across the Mid
MS and OH Valleys.

While the entire warm sector is unstable, areas near the front exist
beneath slightly stronger deep-layer mean winds, on the southern
periphery of the larger scale trough (and MCV) influence.

Visible imagery show increasing CU fields from southern IN into
northern and eastern KY, and scattered storms are likely within this
zone. Locally strong downbursts will be possible, but any more
substantial wind threat would be conditional on a large cluster of
storms producing outflow, and tracking east/southeast near the
boundary. At this time, it appears a watch will not be necessary.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 530
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
410 PM EDT Sun Jul 20 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Connecticut
  Massachusetts
  Far Southern Maine
  Southern New Hampshire
  Rhode Island
  Southern Vermont
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from 410 PM until
  900 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 65 mph possible
  Isolated large hail events to 1 inch in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to continue to
develop and intensify and pose primarily a threat for strong to
severe gusts (55-65 mph).  Isolated large hail may accompany the
stronger cells.  This activity will likely reach the coast by the
mid evening.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles north and south of a line from 30 miles east northeast
of Boston MA to 25 miles south southwest of Pittsfield MA. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU0).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1 inch. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 55 knots. A few
cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 400. Mean storm motion vector
28025.

Mesoscale Discussion 1735
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0735 AM CDT Sun Jul 20 2025

Areas affected...Portions of far east-central IL into central IN

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 201235Z - 201430Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...A small complex of thunderstorms may pose a gradually
increasing threat for damaging winds over the next few hours. Watch
issuance is possible later this morning if this activity can
intensify.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms are ongoing this morning across parts of
central IL, aided by modest west-southwesterly low-level warm
advection and a low-amplitude mid-level perturbation. This
convection should continue to track generally east-southeastward
this morning across parts of central IN along an instability
gradient evident in latest mesoanalysis. While low/mid-level flow is
not overly strong, recent VWPs from KILX/KIND do show some
strengthening with height through mid levels. Resultant 25-30 kt of
effective bulk shear should continue to support some updraft
organization, with a recent supercell structure noted with a
thunderstorm near the IL/IN border. If a small bowing cluster can
become established as some recent high-resolution guidance suggests,
then a greater threat for scattered severe/damaging winds may be
realized across parts of central IN later this morning as the
boundary layer gradually destabilizes with filtered daytime heating.
While not immediately likely, Severe Thunderstorm Watch issuance may
eventually be needed if the ongoing activity can intensify.
