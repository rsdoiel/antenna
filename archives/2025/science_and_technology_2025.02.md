## A Microsoft change to the Linux kernel caused major breakage, but was caught in time

date: 2025-01-15, from: OS News

A change to the Linux 6.13 kernel contributed by a Microsoft engineer ended up changing Linux x86_64 code without proper authorization and in turn causing troubles for users and now set to be disabled ahead of the Linux 6.13 stable release expected next Sunday. ↫ Michael Larabel What I like about this story is that it seems to underline that the processes, checks, and balances in place in Linux kernel development seem to be working &#8211; at least, this time. A breaking change was caught during the prerelease phase, and a fix has been merged to make sure this issue will be fixed before the stable version of Linux 6.13 is released to the wider public. This all sounds great, but there is an element of this story that raises some serious questions. The change itself was related to EXECMEM_ROX, and was intended to improve performance of 64bit AMD and Intel processors, but in turn, this new code broke Control Flow Integrity on some setups, causing some devices not to wake from hibernation while also breaking other features. What makes this spicy is that the code was merged without acknowledgement from any of the x86 kernel maintainers, which made a lot of people very unhappy &#8211; and understandably so. So while the processes and checks and balances worked here, something still went horribly wrong, as such changes should not be able to be merged without acknowledgement from maintainers. This now makes me wonder how many more times this has happened without causing any instantly discoverable issues. For now, some code has been added to revert the offending changes, and Linux 6.13 will ship with Microsoft&#8217;s bad code disabled.

## Google allows advertisers to fingerprint you for even better tracking

date: 2025-01-14, from: OS News

They tried to keep it from prying eyes, but several people did notice it: Google made a pretty significant policy change regarding the use of fingerprinting by advertisers. While Google did not allow advertisers to use digital fingerprinting, the company has now changed its mind on this one. Google really tried to hide this change. The main support article talking about the reasoning behind the change is intentionally obtuse and nebulous, and doesn&#8217;t even link to the actual policy changes being implemented &#8211; which are found in a separate document. Google doesn&#8217;t highlight its changes there, so you have to compare the two versions of the policy yourself. Google claims this change has to be implemented because of &#8220;advances in privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) such as on-device processing, trusted execution environments, and secure multi-party computation&#8221; and &#8220;the rise of new ad-supported devices and platforms&#8221;. What I think this word salad means is that users are regaining a modicum of privacy with some specific privacy-preserving features in certain operating systems and on certain devices, and that the use of dedicated, siloed streaming services is increasing, which is harder for Google and advertisers to track. In other words, Google is relaxing its rules on fingerprinting because we&#8217;re all getting more conscious about privacy. In any event, the advice remains the same: use ad-blockers, preferably at your network level. Install adblocking software and extensions, set up a Pi-Hole, or turn on any adblocking features in your router (my Ubiquiti router has it built-in, and it works like a charm). Remember: your device, your rules. If you don&#8217;t want to see ads, you don&#8217;t have to.

## FM TOWNS Technical Databook partially translated to English

date: 2025-01-14, from: OS News

In recent months, we&#8217;ve talked twice about FM Towns, Fujitsu&#8217;s PC platform aimed solely at the Japanese market. It was almost entirely only available in Japanese, so it&#8217;s difficult to explore for those of us who don&#8217;t speak Japanese. There&#8217;s an effort underway to recreate it as open source, which will most likely take a while, but in the meantime, a part of the FM TOWNS Technical Databook, written by Noriaki Chiba, has been translated from Japanese into English by Joe Groff. From the book&#8217;s preface: That is why the author wrote this book, to serve as an essential manual for enthusiasts, systems developers, and software developers. Typical computer manuals do not adequately cover technical specifications, so users tend to have a hard time understanding the hardware. We have an opportunity to thoroughly break through this barrier, and with this new hardware architecture being a milestone in the FM series, it feels like the perfect time to try. Hardware manuals up to this point have typically only explained the consequences of the hardware design without explaining its fundamentals. By contrast, this book describes the hardware design of the TOWNS from its foundations. Since even expert systems developers can feel like amateurs when working with devices outside of their repertoire, this book focuses on explaining those foundations. This is especially necessary for the FM TOWNS, since it features so many new devices, including a 80386 CPU and a CD-ROM drive. ↫ Noriaki Chiba  This handbook goes into great detail about the inner workings of the hardware, and chapter II, which hasn&#8217;t been translated yet, also dives deep into the BIOS of the hardware, from its first revisions to all the additional features added on top as time progressed. This book, as well as its translation, will be invaluable to people trying to use Towns OS today, to developers working on emulators for the platform, and anyone who fits somewhere in between. It seems this translation was done entirely in Groff&#8217;s free time as a side project, which is commendable. We&#8217;re looking at about 65000 words in the target language, of a highly technical nature, all translated for free because someone decided it was worth it. Sending this over to a translation agency would most likely cost well over €10000. Of course, that would include additional editing and proofreading by parties other than the initial translator(s), but that&#8217;s definitely not needed for a passion project like this. Excellent, valuable work.

## Newfound Galaxy Class May Indicate Early Black Hole Growth, Webb Finds

In December 2022, less than six months after commencing science operations, NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope revealed something never seen before: numerous red objects that appear small on the sky, which scientists soon called “little red dots” (LRDs). Though these dots are quite abundant, researchers are perplexed by their nature, the reason for their unique […]

## Let’s talk about bias

date: 2025-01-13, from: OS News

When someone says you’re biased against them because you object to their stated goal of removing you from society, they’re not actually asking for fairness — they’re demanding complicity. It’s the political equivalent of asking why the gazelle seems to have such a negative view of lions. Think about the underlying logic here: I’m biased because I don’t give equal weight to both sides of a debate about my fundamental rights. I’m biased because I notice patterns in political movements that explicitly state their intentions regarding people like me. I’m biased because I take them at their word when they tell me what they plan to do. ↫ Joan Westenberg OSNews and I will always stand for the right of transgender people to exist, and to enjoy the exact same rights and privileges as any other member of society. This is non-negotiable.

## Enlightenment 0.27.0 released

Enlightenment 0.27.0 has been released, and we&#8217;ve got some highly informative release notes. This is the latest release of Enlightenment. This has a lot of fixes mostly with some new features. ↫ Carsten Haitzler That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s the release notes. Digging into the commit history between 0.26.0 and 0.27.0 gives some more information, and here we can see that a lot of work has been done on the CPU frequency applet (including hopefully making it work properly on FreeBSD), a lot of updated translations, some RandR work, and a ton of other small changes. Does any one of us use Enlightenment on a daily basis? I&#8217;m actually intrigued by this release, as it&#8217;s the first one in two years, and aside from historical usage decades ago &#8211; like many of us, I assume &#8211; I haven&#8217;t really spent any time with the current incarnation.

## Can you complete the Oregon Trail if you wait at a river for 14272 years: a study

date: 2025-01-13, from: OS News

Two years ago, Twitch streamer albrot discovered a bug in the code for crossing rivers. One of the options is to &#8220;wait to see if conditions improve&#8221;; waiting a day will consume food but not recalculate any health conditions, granting your party immortality. From this conceit the Oregon Trail Time Machine was born; a multiday livestream of the game as the party waits for conditions to improve at the final Snake River crossing until the year 10000, to see if the withered travellers can make it to the ruins of ancient Oregon. The first attempt ended in tragedy; no matter what albrot tried, the party would succumb to disease and die almost immediately. A couple of days before New Years Eve 2025, albrot reached out and asked if I knew anything about Apple II hacking. ↫ Scott Percival It may have required some reverse engineering and hackery, but yes, you can reach the ruins of Oregon in the year 16120.

## “The people should own the town square”

date: 2025-01-13, from: OS News

Mastodon, the only remaining social network that isn&#8217;t a fascist hellhole like Twitter or Facebook, is changing its legal and operational foundation to a proper European non-profit. Simply, we are going to transfer ownership of key Mastodon ecosystem and platform components (including name and copyrights, among other assets) to a new non-profit organization, affirming the intent that Mastodon should not be owned or controlled by a single individual.  It also means a different role for Eugen, Mastodon’s current CEO. Handing off the overall Mastodon management will free him up to focus on product strategy where his original passion lies and he gains the most satisfaction. ↫ Official Mastodon blog Eugen Rochko has always been clear and steadfast about Mastodon not being for sale and not accepting any outside investments despite countless offers, and after eight years of both creating and running Mastodon, it makes perfect sense to move the network and its assets to a proper European non-profit. Mastodon&#8217;s actual control over the entire federated ActivityPub network &#8211; the Fediverse &#8211; is actually limited, so it&#8217;s not like the network is dependent on Mastodon, but there&#8217;s no denying it&#8217;s the most well-known part of the Fediverse. The Fediverse is the only social network on which OSNews is actively present (and myself, too, for that matter). By &#8220;actively present&#8221; I only mean I&#8217;m keeping an eye on any possible replies; the feed itself consists exclusively of links to our stories as soon as they&#8217;re published, and that&#8217;s it. Everything else you might encounter on social media is either legacy cruft we haven&#8217;t deleted yet, or something a third-party set up that we don&#8217;t control. RSS means it&#8217;s easy for people to set up third-party, unaffiliated accounts on any social medium posting links to our stories, and that&#8217;s entirely fine, of course. However, corporate social media controlled by the irrational whims of delusional billionaires with totalitarian tendencies is not something we want to be a part of, so aside from visiting OSNews.com and using our RSS feeds, the only other official way to follow OSNews is on Mastodon.

## WordPress is in trouble

date: 2025-01-13, from: OS News

It’s hard to see how to move forward from here. I think the best bet would be for people to rally around a new community-driven infrastructure. This would likely require a fork of WordPress, though, and that’s going to be a messy. The current open source version of WordPress relies on the sites and services Mullenweg controls. Joost de Valk, the original creator of an extremely popular SEO plugin, wrote a blog post with some thoughts on the matter. I’m hoping that more prominent people in the community step up like this, and that some way forward can be found.  Update: Moments after posting this, I was pointed to a story on TechCrunch about Mullenweg deactivating the WordPress.org accounts of users planning a “fork”. This after he previously promoted (though in a slightly mocking way) the idea of forking open source software. In both cases, the people he mentioned weren’t actually planning forks, but musing about future ways forward for WordPress. Mullenweg framed the account deactivations as giving people the push they need to get started. Remember that WordPress.org accounts are required to submit themes, plugins, or core code to the WordPress project. These recent events really make it seem like you’re no longer welcome to contribute to WordPress if you question Matt Mullenweg. ↫ Gavin Anderegg I haven&#8217;t wasted a single word on the ongoing WordPress drama yet, but the longer Matt Mullenweg, Automattic&#8217;s CEO and thus owner of WordPress, keeps losing his mind, I can&#8217;t really ignore the matter any more. OSNews runs, after all, on WordPress &#8211; self-hosted, at least, so not on Mullenweg&#8217;s WordPress.com &#8211; and if things keep going the way they are, I simply don&#8217;t know if WordPress remains a viable, safe, and future-proof CMS for OSNews. I haven&#8217;t discussed this particular situation with OSNews owner, David Adams, yet, mostly since he&#8217;s quite hands-off in the day-to-day operations and has more than enough other matters to take care of, but I think the time has come to start planning for a potential worst-case scenario in which Mullenweg takes even more of whatever he&#8217;s taking and WordPress implodes entirely. Remember &#8211; even if you self-host WordPress outside of Automattic, several core infrastructure parts of WordPress still run through Automattic, so we&#8217;re still dependent on what Mullenweg does or doesn&#8217;t do. I have no answers, announcements, or even plans at this point, but if you or your company depend on WordPress, you might want to start thinking about where to go from here.

## The history and use of /etc/glob in early Unixes

date: 2025-01-13, from: OS News

One of the innovations that the V7 Bourne shell introduced was built in shell wildcard globbing, which is to say expanding things like *, ?, and so on. Of course Unix had shell wildcards well before V7, but in V6 and earlier, the shell didn&#8217;t implement globbing itself; instead this was delegated to an external program, /etc/glob (this affects things like looking into the history of Unix shell wildcards, because you have to know to look at the glob source, not the shell). ↫ Chris Siebenmann I never knew expanding wildcars in UNIX shells was once done by a separate program, but if you stop and think about the original UNIX philosophy, it kind of makes sense. On a slightly related note, I&#8217;m currently very deep into setting up, playing with, and actively using HP-UX 11i v1 on the HP c8000 I was able to buy thanks to countless donations from you all, OSNews readers, and one of the things I want to get working is email in dtmail, the CDE email program. However, dtmail is old, and wants you to do email the UNIX way: instead of dtmail retrieving and sending email itself, it expects other programs to those tasks for you. In other words, to setup and use dtmail (instead of relying on a 2010 port of Thunderbird), I&#8217;ll have to learn how to set up things like sendmail, fetchmail, or alternatives to those tools. Those programs will in turn dump the emails in the maildir format for dtmail to work with. Configuring these tools could very well be above my paygrade, but I&#8217;ll do my best to try and get it working &#8211; I think it&#8217;s more authentic to use something like dtmail than a random Thunderbird port. In any event, this, too, feels very UNIX-y, much like delegating wildcard expansion to a separate program. What this also shows is that the &#8220;UNIX philosophy&#8221; was subject to erosion from the very beginning, and really isn&#8217;t a modern phenomenon like many people seem to imply. I doubt many of the people complaining about the demise of the UNIX philosophy today even knew wildcard expansion used to be done by a separate program.
