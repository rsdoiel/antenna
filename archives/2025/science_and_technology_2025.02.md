## 55 Years Ago: Apollo 13 Prepares for Third Moon Landing

date: 2025-01-13, from: NASA breaking news

Following the historic year of 1969 that saw two successful Moon landings, 1970 opened on a more sober note. Ever-tightening federal budgets forced NASA to rescope its future lunar landing plans. The need for a Saturn V to launch an experimental space station in 1972 forced the cancellation of the final Moon landing mission and [&#8230;]

## The history and use of /etc/glob in early Unixes

date: 2025-01-13, from: OS News

One of the innovations that the V7 Bourne shell introduced was built in shell wildcard globbing, which is to say expanding things like *, ?, and so on. Of course Unix had shell wildcards well before V7, but in V6 and earlier, the shell didn&#8217;t implement globbing itself; instead this was delegated to an external program, /etc/glob (this affects things like looking into the history of Unix shell wildcards, because you have to know to look at the glob source, not the shell). ↫ Chris Siebenmann I never knew expanding wildcars in UNIX shells was once done by a separate program, but if you stop and think about the original UNIX philosophy, it kind of makes sense. On a slightly related note, I&#8217;m currently very deep into setting up, playing with, and actively using HP-UX 11i v1 on the HP c8000 I was able to buy thanks to countless donations from you all, OSNews readers, and one of the things I want to get working is email in dtmail, the CDE email program. However, dtmail is old, and wants you to do email the UNIX way: instead of dtmail retrieving and sending email itself, it expects other programs to those tasks for you. In other words, to setup and use dtmail (instead of relying on a 2010 port of Thunderbird), I&#8217;ll have to learn how to set up things like sendmail, fetchmail, or alternatives to those tools. Those programs will in turn dump the emails in the maildir format for dtmail to work with. Configuring these tools could very well be above my paygrade, but I&#8217;ll do my best to try and get it working &#8211; I think it&#8217;s more authentic to use something like dtmail than a random Thunderbird port. In any event, this, too, feels very UNIX-y, much like delegating wildcard expansion to a separate program. What this also shows is that the &#8220;UNIX philosophy&#8221; was subject to erosion from the very beginning, and really isn&#8217;t a modern phenomenon like many people seem to imply. I doubt many of the people complaining about the demise of the UNIX philosophy today even knew wildcard expansion used to be done by a separate program.
