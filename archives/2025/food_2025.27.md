## A GUIDE TO IRELAND’S BEST FOOD AND DRINK FESTIVALS – FROM GALWAY OYSTER FESTIVAL TO TASTE OF DUBLIN

date: 2025-07-07, from: Irish Food Hub

<p>Why Ireland’s Food and Drink Festivals Are Worth the Journey In recent years, Ireland has emerged as a world-class destination for food lovers, thanks to its vibrant culinary scene, passionate producers, and deep-rooted food heritage. Nowhere is this more apparent than at the country’s many food and drink festivals, which take place across the island throughout the year. These festivals offer a true taste of Ireland—literally and figuratively—by showcasing the best of local ingredients, artisanal skills, and community spirit. From the windswept coasts of Galway to the bustling streets of Dublin, Ireland’s festivals celebrate everything from oysters and craft beer to cheese, whiskey, seaweed, potatoes, and everything in between. Visitors can expect chef demonstrations, foraging walks, tasting sessions, traditional music, storytelling, and a warm welcome that’s uniquely Irish. Whether you&#8217;re a seasoned foodie or a curious traveller, attending one of these festivals is an unforgettable way to experience the rich tapestry of Irish food culture. You&#8217;ll not only enjoy delicious dishes made from local produce, but you&#8217;ll also connect with the passionate people behind the plates—from small-scale farmers and fishers to bakers, brewers, and distillers. Each region has its own specialties and traditions, meaning no two festivals are the same. In Galway, it’s all about the oysters; in Armagh, it’s apples; in Dingle, it’s food and film in equal measure. These events don’t just feed the stomach—they nourish the soul and deepen our appreciation for Ireland’s culinary evolution.

## PEASE PORRIDGE

date: 2025-07-07, from: Irish Food Hub

<p>Pease Porridge – A Hearty Medieval Irish Side Dish Pease Porridge is a traditional Irish dish with deep medieval roots. Made from slow-cooked peas, barley, and savory herbs, this humble yet nourishing side was once a staple in monastic and rural kitchens. Rich in plant-based protein and fiber, it&#8217;s a warming, rustic accompaniment to roasted meats or enjoyed on its own with crusty bread. Preparation Time: 10 minutes Cooking Time: 1 hour 15 minutes Serves: 4–6 people Ingredients 200g dried split peas (soaked overnight or for at least 4 hours) 100g pearl barley 1 onion, finely chopped 2 cloves garlic, minced 1.2L vegetable or chicken stock 1 bay leaf 1 tsp dried thyme or marjoram Salt and pepper to taste Optional: a knob of butter or drizzle of olive oil for serving Instructions Drain the soaked peas and rinse well. Rinse the barley under cold water. In a large pot, heat a splash of oil and gently sauté the onion and garlic until soft and fragrant. Add the peas, barley, stock, bay leaf, and thyme. Stir to combine. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. The mixture should be thick and the peas and barley fully tender. Add more water or stock if it becomes too dry. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove the bay leaf before serving. Optional: stir in a knob of butter or a drizzle of olive oil for added richness. Serving Suggestions Serve warm as a side dish with roasted meats, sausages, or alongside a slice of soda bread. Pease porridge also makes a wholesome vegetarian main when topped with sautéed greens or mushrooms.</p>

## IRISH STEW POPS

date: 2025-07-07, from: Irish Food Hub

<p>Irish Stew Pie Pops – A Whimsical Take on a Hearty Classic Irish Stew Pie Pops are a playful twist on the traditional Irish stew, wrapped in buttery pastry and served on sticks like lollipops. These bite-sized hand pies are filled with tender lamb or beef, carrots, and potatoes in a rich gravy—perfect for parties, picnics, or festive gatherings. Fun, flavorful, and portable, they bring a touch of Irish comfort food to any occasion. Preparation Time: 25 minutes Cooking Time: 35 minutes Serves: 10–12 pie pops Ingredients 1 tbsp oil or butter 200g diced lamb or beef (pre-cooked or browned) 1 small onion, finely chopped 1 carrot, finely diced 1 small potato, finely diced 1 tbsp flour 150ml beef or lamb stock 1 tsp fresh thyme or parsley Salt and pepper to taste 1 sheet shortcrust pastry (ready-rolled or homemade) 1 egg, beaten (for egg wash) 12 food-grade lollipop sticks or wooden skewers Instructions Preheat the oven to 200°C (390°F) and line a baking tray with parchment paper. Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Sauté the onion, carrot, and potato until soft (about 8–10 minutes). Add the cooked meat and stir in the flour to coat. Gradually pour in the stock, stirring until thickened into a gravy. Season with herbs, salt, and pepper. Let the mixture cool slightly. Roll out the pastry and cut into circles (about 6–8cm diameter). Place half of the circles on the baking tray. Spoon a small amount of filling onto the center of each base circle. Place a lollipop stick on top, gently pressing it into the filling. Brush the edges with egg wash, cover with another pastry circle, and seal by pressing the edges with a fork. Brush the tops with more egg wash and cut a small slit in each for steam to escape. Bake for 20–25 minutes or until golden brown and crisp. Allow to cool slightly before serving warm or at room temperature. Serving Suggestions Serve with a side of mustard dip, gravy, or a creamy horseradish sauce for extra indulgence. Ideal for St. Patrick’s Day parties, pub nights, or kid-friendly snacks with an Irish twist!</p>
