Marvel still needs to pay off, in theory</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-05, updated: 2025-05-05, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Over the past 17 years, Marvel Studios has focused as much on the
continuity of its ongoing mega-story as it’s focused on the content of
any given superhero film. The 23-film Infinity Saga was never just about
individual movie narratives — it was about the buildup to Avengers:
Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, the two-part […]</p>

<p>Are you stressed? I am a little stressed. Woo… things are a little
stressful.  But when life serves me a week where I feel like I’m on The
Pitt, the last thing I personally want to do is vibe. Which means I
rarely turn to cozy games for cozy comfort; in times of chaos, I […]</p>

Sleeper is also a solo board game now — and it’s free</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-05, updated: 2025-05-05, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Citizen Sleeper and Citizen Sleeper 2 already have the feel of a
tabletop role-playing game, or maybe just a really good book with some
choose-your-own-adventure elements. Now, series maker Jump Over the Age
has made it official: Citizen Sleeper has a solo board game version,
downloadable for free on itch.io. Called Citizen Sleeper: Spindlejack,

<p>Step aside, Oblivion, there’s a new 20-year-old game getting the
4K-remastered treatment. The original Gears of War, first released in
2006, will be re-released as Gears of War: Reloaded on August 26 for
PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. Yes, you read that right:
Gears of War is coming to PlayStation. Over the […]</p>

<p>Back in January of this year, a third-party accessory manufacturer
was showing off a bunch of accessories for the forthcoming Switch 2 at
CES 2025. The problem? No one had officially seen a Switch 2 in the
wild. Despite plenty of leaks, Nintendo wouldn’t unveil the console
until about a week after CES. Genki would […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-05-05, updated: 2025-05-05, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Just like theatrical release windows have condensed from months to
mere weeks, so too has the spoiler timeline. Only a few short years ago,
a giant like Marvel studio was begging for fans to keep quiet on a
post-release Monday about reveals in a movie like Avengers: Endgame.
Now, for Thunderbolts*, it’s part of week […]</p>

<p>Ever since the first Thunderbolts* trailer came out, sharp-eyed
Marvel Cinematic Universe fans have been theorizing about one particular
gap between the cast list and the footage released. Black Widow villain
Antonia Dreykov, aka Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko), appears on the movie’s
poster and marketing, but is noticeably absent from other scenes and
shots in the […]</p>

<p>On Sunday night, President Donald Trump announced his latest tariff
target: cinema. Trump’s fast-and-loose approach to trade war has already
has caused ripple effects in everything from handheld gaming to the
board game industry, but his latest proclamation is the most direct
attempt to put a finger on entertainment. “The Movie Industry in America

<p>It can sometimes feel like Florence Pugh emerged into the world a
full-formed movie star. One day, she was getting some light awards buzz
for roles in indie roles on the festival circuit; the next, she was
headlining major films and strutting down red carpets in designer
fashion. Now, for another career milestone:  As the […]</p>
