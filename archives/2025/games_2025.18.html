Apple Arcade right now</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-07, updated: 2025-05-06, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>For $7 per month, Apple’s game subscription service provides full
access to a couple hundred titles for iPhone, iPad, and Mac computers —
and its catalog has been a bit of a roller coaster for the last few
years, making it tough for Apple users to determine whether it’s a good
deal or not. Unfortunately, […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-05-06, updated: 2025-05-06, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>The Destiny games, with their laser swords, hover bikes, and space
wizards, have always been Kind of Star Wars. But Destiny 2 will go Full
Unadulterated Star Wars later this year with a new, Lucasfilm-authorized
expansion called Renegades. It literally has lightsabers and Darth Vader
in it. Destiny developer Bungie revealed the Renegades expansion, which

<p>Rockstar Games dropped the second trailer for Grand Theft Auto 6
today, shedding more light about the game’s characters and story. As
fans tried to determine which actors could be voicing which characters,
I was hung up on an entirely different but otherwise completely
inconsequential detail: Is that the Clevelander?! GTA 6 takes place in

<p>Xbox Game Pass continues its consistent 2025 with a mix of
high-profile new games and beloved older ones. Doom: The Dark Ages is
the obvious headliner — the third entry in a series of Doom reboots that
revitalized the shooter series back in 2016. But don’t sleep on Revenge

<p>Rockstar Games revealed a new look at Grand Theft Auto 6 on Tuesday

<p>When two artists who admire each other’s work unexpectedly get to
collaborate, it’s a wonderful thing. That’s exactly what happened when
anime legend Shinichirō Watanabe and his team reached out to John Wick

someone at Stahelski’s boutique Hollywood action studio 87eleven would

<p>Over the past 17 years, Marvel Studios has focused as much on the
continuity of its ongoing mega-story as it’s focused on the content of
any given superhero film. The 23-film Infinity Saga was never just about
individual movie narratives — it was about the buildup to Avengers:
Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, the two-part […]</p>

<p>Citizen Sleeper and Citizen Sleeper 2 already have the feel of a
tabletop role-playing game, or maybe just a really good book with some
choose-your-own-adventure elements. Now, series maker Jump Over the Age

2006, will be re-released as Gears of War: Reloaded on August 26 for

<p>Back in January of this year, a third-party accessory manufacturer
was showing off a bunch of accessories for the forthcoming Switch 2 at
CES 2025. The problem? No one had officially seen a Switch 2 in the
wild. Despite plenty of leaks, Nintendo wouldn’t unveil the console
until about a week after CES. Genki would […]</p>

<p>Ever since the first Thunderbolts* trailer came out, sharp-eyed
Marvel Cinematic Universe fans have been theorizing about one particular

target: cinema. Trump’s fast-and-loose approach to trade war has already
