<p>date: 2025-04-16, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>A one-of-a-kind friendship and a motivating mantra are the
inspiration behind Caroline Sierk’s directorial debut. After the UCLA
School of Theater, Film and Television decided she was not to be a part
of its department when she first applied in 2024, third-year political
science student Sierk took it upon herself to make her own short film,
titled “To Be.” Set in a romanticized 1965 Los Angeles, the movie
follows college student Jack Adler, who chooses to look beyond his world
of academics as he goes off into the city of stars and meets a fellow
dreamer, Diana.</p>
