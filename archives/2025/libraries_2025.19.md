## Guest Post — Gatekeepers of Trust: Reaffirming the Publisher’s Role in Service of the Reader

date: 2025-05-12, from: Scholarly Kitchen

<p>The most vital and enduring contribution of scholarly publishers is their role as gatekeepers — not as obstacles to knowledge but as stewards of quality, integrity, and trust.</p>

## Notice of amendments to Crossref membership terms and bylaws

date: 2025-05-11, from: Crossref Blog

<p>In its March 2025 meeting, the Crossref board unanimously voted to update both the Crossref bylaws and the Crossref membership terms to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Provide more clarity and alignment between our bylaws and membership terms, where they had become out of sync over the years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reflect previous board motions and bring both documents up-to-date with current processes for suspending and revoking membership, and reviewing those decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work towards being more explicit about what &ldquo;Member Practices&rdquo; should look like in terms of preserving the integrity of the scholarly record.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="link-to-updated-membership-termsmembershiptermsmember-terms-2025-and-link-to-updated-bylawsboard-and-governancebylaws"><a href="https://www.crossref.org/membership/terms/member-terms-2025">Link to updated membership terms</a> and <a href="https://www.crossref.org/board-and-governance/bylaws/">link to updated bylaws</a></h4>
<br>
<p>The bylaw changes are effective immediately, and the updated version of the membership terms will come into effect on 11th July 2025.</p>
<p>In accordance with the 60-day notice period, we have emailed the Primary contact on all our active member accounts today. Note: Members do not need to do anything in response to these changes - by continuing to use our services after 11th July, they are accepting the latest version of the terms.</p>
<h3 id="changes-to-the-membership-terms">Changes to the membership terms</h3>
<p>The membership terms will be updated on 11th July to be clearer on, among other things, the importance of accurate metadata, using DOI links everywhere, the all-important reference linking obligation, and the process for suspending and revoking/terminating membership. It also introduces the new concept of &ldquo;<a href="https://www.crossref.org/operations-and-sustainability/membership-operations/member-practices">Member Practices</a>&rdquo;, which a dedicated community committee will propose for board approval. More information about this will follow soon.</p>
<p>You can find the specific changes below, or take a look at <a href="https://www.crossref.org/pdfs/compare-crossref-member-terms-revisions-july-2025.pdf">this marked-up PDF</a> showing the changes between the current (from June 2022) terms and the revised (July 2025) terms.</p>

<h3 id="changes-to-the-bylaws">Changes to the bylaws</h3>
<p>Our bylaws have needed updating for a while, but since these seldom change, we&rsquo;ve saved up a few changes, also to bring them in line with the revised membership terms.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve now modernised the language, ensured that the bylaws match what&rsquo;s in the membership terms, and we&rsquo;ve added in motions that have been agreed by the board but not updated in the bylaws over the last few years. We&rsquo;ve also updated the bylaws in line with the new membership revocation process in the new July 2025 membership terms. The new bylaws also allow for a new group of members to be created to help Crossref define Member Practices.</p>
