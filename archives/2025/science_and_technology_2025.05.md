## GTK announces X11 deprecation, new Android backend, and much more

date: 2025-02-03, from: OS News

Since a number of GTK developer came together at FOSDEM, the project figured now was as good a time as any to give an update on what&#8217;s coming in GTK. First, GTK is implementing some hard cut-offs for old platforms &#8211; Windows 10 and macOS 10.15 are now the oldest supported versions, which will make development quite a bit easier and will simplify several parts of the codebase. Windows 10 was released in 2015 and macOS 10.15 in 2019, which are fair cut-off points, in my book. GTK 4.18 will also bring major accessibility improvements with the AccessKit backend, giving GTK accessibility features on Windows and macOS for the first time, which is great news. Another major new feature is the new Android backend, which, while not yet complete, will allow you to run GTK applications on Android. Do note that this is experimental, so don&#8217;t expect everything to work without any issues quite yet. Lastly, the news that everyone was freaking out about over the weekend: the X11 backend has been deprecated, and will be removed in GTK 5. This freaked a lot of people out, but note that this doesn&#8217;t mean you magically can&#8217;t use GTK 4 applications on X11 anymore &#8211; it merely means that X11 support will be removed in GTK 5, which doesn&#8217;t even exist yet, and with GTK 4 being supported until GTK 6 is released, people using legacy windowing systems like Xorg will be fine for a long time to come. As the GTK project notes on Fedi: The X11 backend being deprecated mainly means that we&#8217;re not going to spend time implementing new features, like dmabuf, graphics offloading, or Vulkan support. X11 support will still exist until GTK4 is EOL, which will happen once GTK *6* is released. We&#8217;re talking about a 20 years horizon, at this point&#8230;  Of course, somebody could show up tomorrow, and implement everything that the Wayland backend does, but for X11. We can always undeprecate things. We are not holding our breath, though… ↫ The GTK project on Fedi This is the right move, and I&#8217;m glad the GTK project is doing this, and is giving everyone ample time to prepare. A lot of people will still freak out, get mad, and scream bloody murder at certain individuals in the wider Linux community, and those people are, of course, free to start working on Xorg. Like the GTK developers, though, I&#8217;m not holding my breath, because despite years of excessive Wayland hate, not a single person has stood up to do the work required to keep Xorg going.

## Run Linux inside a PDF file via a RISC-V emulator

date: 2025-02-03, from: OS News

You might expect PDF files to only be comprised of static documents, but surprisingly, the PDF file format supports Javascript with its own separate standard library. Modern browsers (Chromium, Firefox) implement this as part of their PDF engines. However, the APIs that are available in the browser are much more limited. The full specfication for the JS in PDFs was only ever implemented by Adobe Acrobat, and it contains some ridiculous things like the ability to do 3D rendering, make HTTP requests, and detect every monitor connected to the user&#8217;s system. However, on Chromium and other browsers, only a tiny subset of this API was ever implemented, due to obvious security concerns. With this, we can do whatever computation we want, just with some very limited IO. ↫ LinuxPDF GitHub page I&#8217;m both impressed and concerned.

## The GNU Guix System

date: 2025-02-03, from: OS News

GNU Guix is a package manager for GNU/Linux systems. It is designed to give users more control over their general-purpose and specialized computing environments, and make these easier to reproduce over time and deploy to one or many devices. ↫ GNU Guix website Guix is basically GNU&#8217;s approach to a reproducible, functional package manager, very similar to Nix because, well, it&#8217;s based on Nix. GNU also has a Linux distribution built around Nix, the GNU Guix System, which is fully &#8216;libre&#8217; as all things GNU are, and also makes use of the GNU Shepard init system. Both Shepard and Guix make use of Guile. The last release of the GNU Guix System is a few years old already, but it&#8217;s a rolling release, so that&#8217;s not much of an issue. It uses the Linux kernel, but support for GNU Hurd is also being worked on, for whatever that&#8217;s worth. There&#8217;s also a third-party distribution that is built around the same projects, called rde. It focuses on being lightweight, ready for offline use, and minimal distractions. It&#8217;s probably not suitable for most normal users, but if you&#8217;re a power user and you&#8217;re looking for something a little bit different, this could be for you. While it&#8217;s in active development, it&#8217;s considered usable and stable by its creators. I haven&#8217;t tried it yet, but I&#8217;m definitely intrigued by what it has to offer. Nix sucks up a lot of the attention in this space, so it&#8217;s interesting to see some of the alternatives that aim for similar goals.
