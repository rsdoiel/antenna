## Slow down please

date: 2025-02-17, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>If I were in charge of marketing for the Democrats: 1. I'd restart the online channel that Kamala Harris had that was shut down on Election Day. 2. I'd get out the message over and over about how things are going too fast, we need to slow it down, so we can consider what's happening. Who? The people. I know this will resonate with almost everyone in the US, no matter who they voted for. Stop I want to know how these changes will help or hurt me, my family, community. For Trump voters, it was fun to make my statement, but I'm afraid this is going too far. I think we can all relate to that. We aren't being represented here. </p>
<p>I asked <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Google Gemini</a> to visualize what it feels like to be watching what's happening in the US from inside the US. This came close to capturing it, but it could have expressed the fear of it more clearly. Slow down, please, let us figure out what you're doing. </p>

<p>I was about to post a complain about swift concurrency and the more I twisted myself into a pretzel the less aware I was of a thread misuse I was attempting.</p><p>I was working extra hard to attempt to use a thread bound API from the wrong thread.</p><p>In practice this would have crashed.</p>

BTW, no one thought much about the threading structure we use on Bluesky. As far as I can tell it was copied from Twitter. It's not a very good structure. It encourages spam and abuse. You gotta wonder if the threading structure had evolved, or if there were more competition, different approaches to see what would happen, we might have avoided our meltdown with a better design.

Great quote from a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=severance+s2e5">favorite show</a>. "He put the dick in contradiction." This is a show that doesn't often indulge in that kind of humor. I imagine they must've had a great time with it in the writer's room. Or was it ad-lib'd? And wtf does it mean?

I sure do. It has never happened before. But it has happened now, and the group that is governing is doing it illegally, and is dismantling the country as quickly as they can, assuming someone will at some point try to stop them? Is that correct? What comes next?

## OpenSSL does a QUIC API

date: 2025-02-16, from: Daniel Stenberg Blog

But will it satisfy the world? I have blogged several times in the past about how OpenSSL decided to not ship the API for QUIC a long time ago, even though the entire HTTP world was hoping for it &#8211; or even expecting it. OpenSSL rejected the proposal to merge the proposed API and thereby &#8230; <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/02/16/openssl-does-a-quic-api/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">OpenSSL does a QUIC API</span> <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>

After World War II, the vast majority of Americans&#8212;Democrats and Republicans alike&#8212;agreed that the federal government should regulate business, provide a basic social safety net, promote infrastructure, and protect civil rights.
