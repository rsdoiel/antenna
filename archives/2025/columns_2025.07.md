## Changing every line three times

date: 2025-02-18, from: Daniel Stenberg Blog

Is there some magic making three times, or even pi, the number of times you need to write code for it to be good? So what am I talking about? Let&#8217;s rewind and start with talking about writing code. Let&#8217;s say you start out by writing a program that is exactly one hundred lines long, &#8230; <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/02/18/changing-every-line-three-times/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Changing every line three times</span> <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>

## Story About Medical Device Security

date: 2025-02-18, updated: 2025-02-17, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Ben Rothke <a href="https://brothke.medium.com/how-not-to-hire-for-a-senior-information-security-role-4bf71ce7ee26">relates a story</a> about me working with a medical device firm back when I was with BT. I don&#8217;t remember the story at all, or who the company was. But it sounds about right.</p>

## February 17, 2025 

date: 2025-02-18, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

Today is Presidents Day, a somewhat vague holiday placed in 1968 on the third Monday in February, near the date of George Washington&#8217;s birthday on February 22, 1732, but also traditionally including Abraham Lincoln, who was born on February 12, 1809.

## ★ Golfo del Gringo Loco

date: 2025-02-18, updated: 2025-02-18, from: Daring Fireball

Much serious thought and consideration, from very smart people in Mountain View and Cupertino, went into determining how to respond to a profoundly silly and thoughtless executive order. Yet that response is disturbing.

## Maybe I need re-writer’s block

date: 2025-02-17, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

I&#8217;ve never had writer&#8217;s block. Give me a writing assignment and I&#8217;ll blab something out. It might even be good, or at least good enough. But I don&#8217;t write in final draft. Or talk that way. I know people who can do either or both. But I don&#8217;t know how they do it, much as [&#8230;]

## My post is my house

date: 2025-02-17, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>One of the not-good things about Mastodon is that you can't moderate comments under your own posts. </p>
<p>If someone says something abusive, it's there for everyone to see, forever.</p>
<p>I've come to value the feature in Facebook that gives the author full discretion over what comments remain, to head off bad vibes. </p>
<p>I think of a post I write as my house, and I want people who visit to feel respected.</p>
<p>A turd in the middle of the living room is not respectful. </p>

## My offer to Democrats in DC

date: 2025-02-17, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>A simple idea, a quid pro quo.</p>
<p>If we want Democrats to support the Constitution, we have to demonstrate that we will support them. </p>
<p>We are the government of the US, Congress represents us. </p>
<p>We have been too passive. </p>
<p>But then, they have to include us in governing. </p>
<p>No more shutting off the connection after the election.</p>
<p>Seems like a fair deal.</p>

## Slow down please

date: 2025-02-17, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>If I were in charge of marketing for the Democrats: 1. I'd restart the online channel that Kamala Harris had that was shut down on Election Day. 2. I'd get out the message over and over about how things are going too fast, we need to slow it down, so we can consider what's happening. Who? The people. I know this will resonate with almost everyone in the US, no matter who they voted for. Stop I want to know how these changes will help or hurt me, my family, community. For Trump voters, it was fun to make my statement, but I'm afraid this is going too far. I think we can all relate to that. We aren't being represented here. </p>
<p>I asked <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Google Gemini</a> to visualize what it feels like to be watching what's happening in the US from inside the US. This came close to capturing it, but it could have expressed the fear of it more clearly. Slow down, please, let us figure out what you're doing. </p>

BTW, no one thought much about the threading structure we use on Bluesky. As far as I can tell it was copied from Twitter. It's not a very good structure. It encourages spam and abuse. You gotta wonder if the threading structure had evolved, or if there were more competition, different approaches to see what would happen, we might have avoided our meltdown with a better design.
