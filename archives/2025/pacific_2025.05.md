## ‘I thought we voted for America first’ – Trump Gaza plan divides his party

date: 2025-02-06, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>WASHINGTON &#8212; U.S. President Donald Trump&#8217;s proposal that the U.S. take over the war-torn Gaza Strip prompted confusion and skepticism from some of his fellow Republicans on Wednesday, while others backed his &#8220;bold, decisive&#8221; idea. Meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Tuesday, Trump proposed the U.S. &#8220;take over Gaza&#8221; and create a &#8220;Riviera of the Middle East&#8221; after resettling Palestinians elsewhere. The idea prompted international condemnation and some dissent from Republicans in Congress, who have largely fallen in line behind Trump&#8217;s initiatives such as pausing foreign aid and eliminating thousands of federal workers.</p>
