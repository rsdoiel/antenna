## EVs power up, oil demand growth slows: 2024’s rapid global energy shift – IEA

date: 2025-03-24, from: Electrek Feed

<div class="feat-image"><img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Rivian-R2-pre-orders.jpeg?quality=82&#038;strip=all&#038;w=1400" /></div><p>Global energy demand spiked in 2024, driven largely by surging electricity use, according to a new report released today by the International Energy Agency (IEA). Electricity consumption jumped by nearly 1,100 terawatt-hours – a hefty 4.3% increase – nearly twice the annual average growth of the past decade.</p>



<p>This dramatic rise was largely fueled by the electrification of transportation, record-breaking global temperatures that ramped up cooling needs, coupled with increased industrial activity, and growing energy demand from data centers and AI applications.</p>

## Tesla Full Self-Driving is stagnating after Elon said it is going exponential

date: 2025-03-23, from: Electrek Feed

<div class="feat-image"><img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Tesla-Full-Self-Driving-Beta-stagnate.jpg?quality=82&#038;strip=all&#038;w=1500" /></div><p>Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) is stagnating with no real improvement in miles between disengagement in months just as CEO Elon Musk said it is going exponential.</p>



<p>The stagnation of FSD could be explained by Tesla making a pivot and focusing on its geo-fenced ride-hailing service instead of its long-standing promises.</p>

## All the best EV (and PHEV) cash back deals we could find for March 2025 [Updated]

date: 2025-03-23, from: Electrek Feed

<div class="feat-image"><img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/big_MONEY_MAIN.jpg?quality=82&#038;strip=all&#038;w=1600" /></div><p>Cynics will point at big rebates and claim they mean the vehicle isn’t selling, but that just exposes them as industry noobs. A rebate is a powerful financial tool that helps dealers overcome obstacles like negative equity, poor credit, down payment requirements, and interest rate objections so you can drive home in the car of your dreams today.</p>



<p>If you’re dealing with any of the above, pay attention: these EVs could get you behind the wheel of a new electric ride sooner than you think!</p>
