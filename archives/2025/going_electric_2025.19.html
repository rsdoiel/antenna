It’s been less than a month since
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/xpeng/">XPeng Motors</a> began
teasing a new camouflage sedan codenamed the E29. This morning (or this
evening if you’re in China), XPeng unveiled the mystery sedan as its
next-generation P7. This vast redesign of the Chinese automaker’s
flagship BEV sedan is a bona fide stunner, and makes me wish I could
drive one of my own in the US.

As it scrambles to turn things around,
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/nissan/">Nissan</a> is scrapping
plans to build a new LFP battery plant in Japan. The facility was
expected to be key to reducing EV battery costs to keep up with leaders
like BYD. With alarm bells ringing, Nissan is preparing to cut 20,000
jobs, or about 15% of its global workforce.

US republicans have unveiled their new tax proposal, which kills a slew

improve US air quality, and boost US manufacturing. The republican
proposal instead channels that money to wealthy elites, increasing the

<p>
As perhaps one of the most prolific electric bike reviewers on the
internet, I spend a lot of time riding city streets and have
occasionally wondered if this is the way I’ll go out one day. Yesterday,
I nearly had the answer to that question as a police cruiser almost
smeared me across three lanes of traffic.
</p>
<p>
It happened to occur while I was in the middle of filming a review of a
Velotric Breeze 1 electric bike. With the rare opportunity of catching a
moment like that on camera, it turned into a chance for me to take a
second look at what I did right as well as what I might have done wrong
to wind up in that situation.
</p>
<p>
And why keep that kind of analysis to myself? Come along with me while I
Monday morning quarterback myself.

While the current majority in DC shared intentions to likely kill the
existing
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/ev-federal-tax-credit/">$7,500
federal EV tax credit,</a> some language in a (very fluid) proposal
suggests that not all automakers will be immediately affected. For
example, Rivian is an American automaker whose sales are young enough
that US consumers might still be able to take advantage of the tax
credit, and that could also include the upcoming R2 EVs.

While the current majority in DC shared intentions to likely kill the
existing
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/ev-federal-tax-credit/">$7,500

suggests that not all automakers will be immediately affected. For
example, Rivian is an American automaker whose sales are young enough
that US consumers might still be able to take advantage of the tax
credit, and that could also include the upcoming R2 EVs.
