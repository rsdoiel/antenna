I came across
<a href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/x-redesigns-water-pistol-emoji-back-to-a-firearm/">a
post last July on Emojipedia</a>, in which Keith Broni noted that
Twitter, or X, had redesigned its PISTOL emoji. PISTOL had always been
controversial: most online platforms started off with PISTOLs drawn as
realistic firearms, but, over the course of the mid-2010s,
<a href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/apple-and-the-gun-emoji/">most of
them moved to toylike renderings of water pistols</a> instead. Twitter
had followed suit.

on Intel and Nvidia GPUs on Raspberry Pi</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Nvidia GPUs have been running fine on Arm for a while now—I just
upgraded the
<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/system76-built-fastest-windows-arm-pc">System76
Thelio Astra</a> to an RTX 4080 Super and am testing it now.
</p>
<p>
But Nvidia seems to have a partnership with Ampere, which probably leads
to their drivers getting priority support, and likely a few special edge
cases in code to work around a couple PCIe quirks on the Altra CPUs.
Nvidia <em>also</em> builds their own Arm CPUs—a <em>lot</em> of them—so
Arm support is definitely a priority for them.

LLMs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-27, updated: 2025-02-27, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Interesting research:
“<a href="https://martins1612.github.io/emergent_misalignment_betley.pdf">Emergent
Misalignment: Narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned
LLMs</a>“:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b> We present a surprising result regarding LLMs and
alignment. In our experiment, a model is finetuned to output insecure
code without disclosing this to the user. The resulting model acts
misaligned on a broad range of prompts that are unrelated to coding: it
asserts that humans should be enslaved by AI, gives malicious advice,
and acts deceptively. Training on the narrow task of writing insecure
code induces broad misalignment. We call this emergent misalignment.
This effect is observed in a range of models but is strongest in GPT-4o
and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct. Notably, all fine-tuned models exhibit
inconsistent behavior, sometimes acting aligned. Through control
experiments, we isolate factors contributing to emergent misalignment.
Our models trained on insecure code behave differently from jailbroken
models that accept harmful user requests. Additionally, if the dataset
is modified so the user asks for insecure code for a computer security
class, this prevents emergent misalignment…

Me as a grad student at

programming on a Unix system, probably working on my first outliner.

Note that the terminal I was using had uppercase and lowercase letters.

I lived in a big house with 10 roommates. And as weird as it must seem
from the point of view of 2025, I was the only one who used a computer.
I would tell them all the time that we’d all use computers someday. They
rolled their eyes and smiled. “There goes Dave again.” The reason I was
so sure was email and writing tools.

Solarium Commission</a>, a “bipartisan team of lawmakers and outside
experts”, launched their
<a href="https://www.fdd.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CSC-Final-Report.pdf">report</a>.
Among its 82 recommendations were several related to liability:<br />
<ul>
<li>
3.3.2: Clarify Liability for Federally Directed Mitigation, Response and
Recovery Efforts
</li>
<li>
4.2 Congress should pass a law establishing that final goods assemblers
of software, hardware, and firmware are liable for damages from
incidents that exploit known and unpatched vulnerabilities
</li>
<li>
4.3 Congress should establish a Bureau of Cyber Statistics charged with
collecting and providing statistical data on cybersecurity and the cyber
ecosystem to inform policymaking and government programs
</li>
</ul>

In March 2023 the Biden administration announced their
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230303001605/https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf"><i>National
Cybersecurity Strategy</i></a>. As regards liability, it stated:<br />
<blockquote>
Markets impose inadequate costs on — and often reward — those entities
that introduce vulnerable products or services into our digital
ecosystem. Too many vendors ignore best practices for secure
development, ship products with insecure default configurations or known
vulnerabilities, and integrate third-party software of unvetted or
unknown provenance. Software makers are able to leverage their market
position to fully disclaim liability by contract, further reducing their
incentive to follow secure-by-design principles or perform pre-release
testing. Poor software security greatly increases systemic risk across
the digital ecosystem and leave[s] American citizens bearing the
ultimate cost.
</blockquote>
What did the administration
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230303001605/https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf">propose
to do about this</a>?:<br />
<blockquote>
The Administration will work with Congress and the private sector to
develop legislation establishing liability for software products and
services. Any such legislation should prevent manufacturers and software
publishers with market power from fully disclaiming liability by
contract, and establish higher standards of care for software in
specific high-risk scenarios. To begin to shape standards of care for
secure software development, the Administration will drive the
development of an adaptable safe harbor framework to shield from
liability companies that securely develop and maintain their software
products and services. This safe harbor will draw from current best
practices for secure software development, such as the NIST Secure
Software Development Framework. It also must evolve over time,
incorporating new tools for secure software development, software
transparency, and vulnerability discovery.
</blockquote>
In October 2024 Eric Geller looked at what happened to the Cyberspace
Solarium Commission’s recommendations in
<a href="https://therecord.media/cybersecurity-software-liability-standards-white-house-struggle"><i>The
struggle for software liability: Inside a ‘very, very, very hard
problem’</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Six years after Congress tasked a group of cybersecurity experts with
reimagining America’s approach to digital security, virtually all of
that group’s proposals have been implemented. But there’s one glaring
exception that has especially bedeviled policymakers and advocates: a
proposal to make software companies legally liable for major failures
caused by flawed code.
</blockquote>
It wasn’t like the Commission invented the
<a href="https://therecord.media/cybersecurity-software-liability-standards-white-house-struggle">liability
problem</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800176.809980">Since the
1980s</a>, legal scholars have discussed how liability should apply to
flawed software. The fact that there still isn’t a consensus about the
right approach underscores how complicated the issue is.<br /> <br />
One of the biggest hurdles is establishing a “standard of care,” a
minimum security threshold that companies could meet to avoid lawsuits.
There’s disagreement about “how to define a reasonably secure software
product,” Dempsey said, and technology evolves so quickly that it might
not be wise to codify one specific standard.<br /> <br /> Various
solutions have been proposed, including letting juries decide if
software is safe enough — like they do with other products — and letting
companies qualify for “safe harbor” from lawsuits through existing
programs like
<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/secure-software-attestation-form">a
government attestation process</a>.<br /> <br />
<a href="https://www.solarium.gov/report">The Solarium Commission
proposed</a> safe harbor for companies that patch known vulnerabilities.
But that would only address part of the problem.
</blockquote>
Even a very weak “duty of care” would be a big improvement. It would,
for example, outlaw hard-wired passwords, require 2-factor
authentication with FIDO or passkeys
<a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/02/24/1442246/google-to-eliminate-sms-authentication-in-gmail-implement-qr-codes">not
SMS</a>, require mailers to display the actual target of links, and so
on.<br /> <br /> The industry pushback has been
<a href="https://therecord.media/cybersecurity-software-liability-standards-white-house-struggle">ferocious</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
One of the industry’s chief arguments is that liability would distract
companies from improving security and overburden them with compliance
costs. “The more companies are spending their time on thinking about
liability, the less they might be spending their time on higher-value
activities,” said Henry Young, senior director of policy at the software
trade group BSA.
</blockquote>
The problem is that the “higher-value activities” typically result in
<i>adding</i> vulnerabilites to their products. I doubt that management
at victim companies like
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2017/10/not-whether-but-when.html">Equifax</a>
or
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/02/us/politics/russian-hacking-government.html">SolarWinds</a>’
customers would think that adding flashy new features was “higher-value”
than fixing vulnerabilities.<br /> <br /> You can’t say the industry’s
flacks
<a href="https://therecord.media/cybersecurity-software-liability-standards-white-house-struggle">aren’t
creative</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Liability opponents say insecure software isn’t the biggest
cybersecurity problem, pointing to widespread and devastating phishing
attacks.
</blockquote>
Riiiiight! Phishing is a force of nature, not a tactic enabled by the
industry’s insecure products.<br /> <br /> Some of the industry’s
arguments are
<a href="https://therecord.media/cybersecurity-software-liability-standards-white-house-struggle">laughable</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
They argue that even if policymakers want to focus on software security,
there are better ways to prod vendors forward, such as encouraging
corporate-board oversight.
</blockquote>
Board members are insulated from liability by D&amp;O insurance, so
“encouraging” them will have precisely zero effect.<br /> <br /> But
this is my
<a href="https://therecord.media/cybersecurity-software-liability-standards-white-house-struggle">favorite</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
And they warn that focusing on liability will distract the government
from pursuing better policies with its limited resources.
</blockquote>
Exactly what are the “better policies” they desire? To be left alone to
ship more buggy products.<br /> <br /> The industry whines that they
wouldbe treated differently from others, conveniently ignoring that the
others can’t
<a href="https://therecord.media/cybersecurity-software-liability-standards-white-house-struggle">disclaim
liability</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Critics also contend that it’s unfair to punish companies for digital
flaws that are deliberately exploited by malicious actors, a scenario
that’s rare in most industries with liability, such as food and
automobiles.
</blockquote>
In 2023 nearly
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle_fatality_rate_in_U.S._by_year">41,000</a>
people were killed by automobiles in the US. Many, probably most of
those deaths were caused by “malicious actors” exploiting flaws such as
cars that know what the speed limit is but don’t enforce it, or could
but don’t detect that the driver is drunk or sleepy. Liability hasn’t
caused the auto industry to get real about safety. Instead we have
<a href="XXX">Fake Self-Driving</a> killing people.
<a href="https://usafacts.org/articles/how-many-people-get-sick-from-foodborne-illnesses/">And</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Up to 48 million people get sick from a foodborne illness every year,
and up to 3,000 are estimated to die from them.
</blockquote>
Finally, the industry claims that
<a href="https://therecord.media/cybersecurity-software-liability-standards-white-house-struggle">everything
in just fine</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Industry leaders say liability is unnecessary because there’s already a
working alternative: the marketplace, where businesses are accountable
to their customers and invest in security to avoid financial and
reputational punishment. As for contracts disclaiming liability, the
industry says customers can negotiate security expectations with their
vendors.<br /> <br /> “We’re open to conversations about any way to
improve software security,” Young said. “Our customers care about it,
and we want to deliver for them.”
</blockquote>
Have you tried to “negotiate security expectations” with Microsoft, or
have a conversation with Oracle about a “way to improve software
security”? How did it go? I guess it
<a href="https://therecord.media/cybersecurity-software-liability-standards-white-house-struggle">didn’t
go well</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
“Just telling organizations that not fixing security bugs will impact
their business is not enough of an incentive,” a group of tech experts
warned the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in
<a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25219051/cisa-cybersecurity-advisory-committee_draft-recommendations_20241011.pdf#page=5">a
report</a> approved this month.<br /> <br /> Experts also rejected the
idea that most customers could negotiate liability into their contracts.
Few companies have leverage in negotiations with software giants, and
few customers know enough about software security to make any demands of
their vendors.
</blockquote>
Despite its laughable nature, the industry’s pushback ensured that
nothing happened
<a href="https://therecord.media/cybersecurity-software-liability-standards-white-house-struggle">until
it was too late</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Senior administration officials haven’t lived up to their lofty rhetoric
about shifting the burden of cybersecurity from customers to suppliers,
Herr said. “There is an attitude in this White House of a willingness to
defer to industry in operational questions in a lot of cases.”
</blockquote>
In the end it may come down to judges to determine whether the
disclaimers of liability are effective, and there may be a siight ray of
hope. Last December Sean Lyngaas reported that
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/20/tech/whatsapp-nso-group-pegasus/index.html"><i>Judge
rules Israeli firm NSO Group liable for damages in WhatsApp hacking
case</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Messaging service WhatsApp claimed a major legal victory over Israeli
spyware firm NSO Group on Friday after a federal judge ruled that NSO
was liable under federal and California law for a 2019 hacking spree
that breached over 1,000 WhatsApp users.<br /> <br /> It’s a rare legal
win for activists who have sought to rein in companies that make
powerful spyware, or software capable of surveilling calls and texts,
that has reportedly been used on journalists, human rights advocates and
political dissidents worldwide.
</blockquote>
So in the US the disclaimers of liability in the end user license
agreement are, and will presumably continue to be, valid unless your
product is intended to commit crimes such as violations of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act">Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act</a>. The bar for a victim to prove liability is
impossibly high.<br /> <br /> Color me skeptical, but Jim Dempsey writes
in
<a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-maga-case-for-software-liability"><i>The
MAGA Case for Software Liability</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Under the current administration, the instinctive inclination of
post-Reagan Republicans to rely only on market forces to hold businesses
responsible for the consequences of their actions would seem to preclude
the use of government policy to improve the security of software vital
to business and government operations. Indeed, the Trump team has
promised
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/musk-and-ramaswamy-the-doge-plan-to-reform-government-supreme-court-guidance-end-executive-power-grab-fa51c020">wholesale
repudiation</a> of regulations adopted in the past four years, so new
limits on industry would seem especially unlikely.<br /> <br /> There
are, however, good reasons why the new administration should not default
to repealing the cybersecurity actions of the past four years and
passively accepting severe cyber vulnerabilities in critical
infrastructure. In fact, as I explained in a series last year on
initiatives
<a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/stitching-together-the-cybersecurity-patchwork-quilt--infrastructure">aimed
at infrastructure</a> and
<a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/stitching-together-the-cybersecurity-patchwork-quilt--data">data</a>,
much of the Biden administration’s cybersecurity agenda was built on
projects launched by President Trump in his first term. The Trump
administration would do well to remember the underlying principles that
spurred it to initiate these actions the first time around.

The EU seems to be taking an opposite approach. Tom Uren
<a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-eu-throws-a-hand-grenade-on-software-liability">wrote</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Earlier this month, the EU Council
<a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/10/10/eu-brings-product-liability-rules-in-line-with-digital-age-and-circular-economy/">issued
a directive</a> updating the EU’s product liability law to treat
software in the same way as any other product.
<a href="https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/single-market/goods/free-movement-sectors/liability-defective-products_en">Under
this law</a>, consumers can claim compensation for damages caused by
defective products without having to prove the vendor was negligent or
irresponsible. In addition to personal injury or property damages, for
software products, damages may be awarded for the loss or destruction of
data.
</blockquote>
In the EU companies are presumed to be liable for a defective product
unless they can qualify for a
“<a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-eu-throws-a-hand-grenade-on-software-liability">safe
harbor</a>”:<br />
<blockquote>
Rather than define a minimum software development standard, the
directive sets what we regard as the highest possible bar. Software
makers can avoid liability if they prove a defect was not discoverable
given the “objective state of scientific and technical knowledge” at the
time the product was put on the market.
</blockquote>
The directive is based on
<a href="https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/single-market/goods/free-movement-sectors/liability-defective-products_en">2
main principles</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
the manufacturer has to compensate the damage caused by a defective
product of theirs
</li>
<li>
the victim has to prove the product’s defectiveness, the damage that was
caused and establish that this defectiveness was the cause of the damage
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
And the
<a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/10/10/eu-brings-product-liability-rules-in-line-with-digital-age-and-circular-economy/">products
are defined thus</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Digital economy: The new law extends the definition of “product” to
digital manufacturing files and software. Also online platforms can be
held liable for a defective product sold on their platform just like any
other economic operators if they act like one.
</li>
<li>
Circular economy: When a product is repaired and upgraded outside the
original manufacturer’s control, the company or person that modified the
product should be held liable.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
Unlike the current and proposed US approaches, the EU’s approach imposes
victim-driven consequences for:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Failure to use current software tools and development practices to
prevent defects. Note that the directive gives victims the right to
obtain evidence of this kind.
</li>
<li>
Failure to acknowledge and respond to defect reports from customers and
third parties, because they were clearly discoverable via the “objective
state of scientific and technical knowledge”. But note the caveat “at
the time the product was put on the market”.
</li>
<li>
Failure to issue timely fixes for defects.
</li>
</ul>
Uren
<a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-eu-throws-a-hand-grenade-on-software-liability">concludes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Major software vendors used by the world’s most important enterprises
and governments are publishing comically vulnerable code without fear of
any blowback whatsoever. So yes, the status quo needs change. Whether it
needs a hand grenade lobbed at it is an open question. We’ll have our
answer soon.
</blockquote>
<h2>
Open Source
</h2>
Neither the US nor the EU approaches seem to take account of the fact
that many of the “products” they propose to regulate are based upon open
source code. An under-appreciated feature of the rise of IT has been the
extraordinary productivity unleashed by the 1988
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses">Berkeley Software
Distribution license</a> and Richard Stallman’s 1989
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">GNU
General Public License</a>.
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">Version 3 of the
Gnu Public License</a> Section 15 states:<br />
<blockquote>
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT

THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
</blockquote>
And Section 16
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">states</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR

SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE
WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
</blockquote>
That these licenses disclaimed warranties and liabilities was the key to
the open source revolution because it enabled <i>individuals</i>, rather
than developers protected by their employer’s lawyers, to contribute.
Without the disclaimers individual developers would face unacceptable
legal risk. On the other hand, open source is also a channel for
malware. Shaurya Malwa reports on an example in
<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/02/26/hackers-are-using-fake-github-code-to-steal-your-bitcoin-kaspersky"><i>Hackers
Are Using Fake GitHub Code to Steal Your Bitcoin:
Kaspersky</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The report warned users of a “GitVenom” campaign that’s been active for
at least two years but is steadily on the rise, involving planting
malicious code in fake projects on the popular code repository
platform.<br /> <br /> The attack starts with seemingly legitimate
GitHub projects — like making Telegram bots for managing bitcoin wallets
or tools for computer games.<br /> <br /> Each comes with a polished
README file, often AI-generated, to build trust. But the code itself is
a Trojan horse: For Python-based projects, attackers hide nefarious
script after a bizarre string of 2,000 tabs, which decrypts and executes
a malicious payload.<br /> <br /> For JavaScript, a rogue function is
embedded in the main file, triggering the launch attack. Once activated,
the malware pulls additional tools from a separate hacker-controlled
GitHub repository.
</blockquote>
<p><br /> Balancing the need to stop vendors “publishing comically
vulnerable code” with the need to nurture the open source ecosystem is a
difficult problem.<br /> <br /></p>

Here is the thing, we made it so that you can share your games directly
to wasm or our runtime - and it really works better with the native app,
as you get the emulated controllers for most games (so it becomes
trivial to add mobile support).
</p>
<p>
So the iPhone makes a lot of sense, but might delay my grand plans to
move on to the next wave of Godot tasks.

Right now Godot for iPad is limited to the iPad. I don’t want to publish
to the iPhone because while it works, it has lots of usability problems.
</p>
<p>
But it is a phenomenal Godot game runtime. It would take me some two
maybe three months to tune the UI for iPhone.
</p>
<p>
And I struggle between doing that or shipping iPad-only to start.

traveler</a>, discovering WordPress 20 years after I left UserLand. I
care that it’s open source, but I care much more that it’s open web esp
after we’ve been so thoroughly dominated by feature-limited silos such
as Twitter, Facebook and yes – even Mastodon and Bluesky. Even if
there’s a theoretical way to do it, practically speaking we have to wait
for their developers to implement the features we want. Open source
doesn’t help there, but open web does. Matt puts the emphasis on the
open source part, that’s why it wasn’t until very recently that I
realized that <i>open web</i> is more important, to me at least.</p>

<h2 id="death-panel">Death panel</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-26, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I asked ChatGPT to draw a picture of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_panel">death panel</a> as
described by Republican lawmakers as they fought the Affordable Care
Act. I was surprised it was willing to do it.
</p>
<p>
According to the bot: “The concept of ‘death panels’ was a widely
debunked political talking point used by opponents of the Affordable
Care Act. It falsely suggested that government-run committees would
decide whether individuals—especially the elderly or disabled—would
receive life-saving care.
</p>
<p>
“I can generate an image depicting a grim, dystopian bureaucratic
setting where a group of shadowy officials in suits are sitting at a
long, dark table, stamping papers while an elderly patient looks on with
concern. The room would have a cold, sterile look, with a looming clock
symbolizing bureaucratic power over life and death.”

Last month, the UK government
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/">demanded</a>
that Apple weaken the security of iCloud for users worldwide. On Friday,
Apple took steps to comply for users in the United Kingdom. But the
British law is written in a way that requires Apple to give its
government access to anyone, anywhere in the world. If the government
demands Apple weaken its security worldwide, it would increase
everyone’s cyber-risk in an already dangerous world.
</p>
<p>
If you’re an iCloud user, you have the option of turning on something
called “<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102651">advanced data
protection</a>,” or ADP. In that mode, a majority of your data is
end-to-end encrypted. This means that no one, not even anyone at Apple,
can read that data. It’s a restriction enforced by
mathematics—cryptography—and not policy. Even if someone successfully
hacks iCloud, they can’t read ADP-protected data…

Poor Gidget had a very bad no good day today, with her annual check-up

good, except that uh… her anal glands had to be manually expressed 😆 At
least the vet gave her a Churu for her trouble.

Hackers Steal $1.5B in Cryptocurrency</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-25, updated: 2025-02-25, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
It looks like a
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/02/how-north-korea-pulled-off-a-1-5-billion-crypto-heist-the-biggest-in-history/">very
sophisticated</a> attack against the Dubai-based exchange Bybit:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Bybit officials
<a href="https://announcements.bybit.com/article/incident-update---eth-cold-wallet-incident-blt292c0454d26e9140/">disclosed</a>
the theft of more than 400,000 ethereum and staked ethereum coins just
hours after it occurred. The notification said the digital loot had been
stored in a “Multisig Cold Wallet” when, somehow, it was transferred to
one of the exchange’s hot wallets. From there, the cryptocurrency was
transferred out of Bybit altogether and into wallets controlled by the
unknown attackers.
</p>
<p>
[…]
</p>
<p>
…a subsequent investigation by Safe found no signs of unauthorized
access to its infrastructure, no compromises of other Safe wallets, and
no obvious vulnerabilities in the Safe codebase. As investigators
continued to dig in, they finally settled on the true cause. Bybit
ultimately said that the fraudulent transaction was “manipulated by a
sophisticated attack that altered the smart contract logic and masked
the signing interface, enabling the attacker to gain control of the ETH
Cold Wallet.”…

<p>date: 2025-02-25, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I posted
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lixpclusms2l">something
sad</a> on Bluesky last night. It was short, but the thinking behind it
wasn’t. Here’s the quote:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
It might be the last minute but we can still legally remove Trump, and
objectively it’s the only thing that makes any sense.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I got two responses from
<a href="https://muckrack.com/karoli-kuns">Karoli Kuns</a>, an early
blogger, and editor at Crooks and Liars, a long-lived blog that if I
recall correctly was started with software I wrote in 2002, so I feel
some pride in helping in a small way to enable her accomplishments and
contributions, which are long-lived and substantial. Both of her
responses missed the sadness in my post, the reflectiveness, but rather
did what a lot of arguing online devolves to, showing someone else that
their thinking is wrong. I couldn’t think straight I was so angry, so I
just said no, I’m not going to do this. Lots of experience trying to
explain myself in little 300-character bursts, there’s no reason to add
to the grief of the moment.
</p>
<p>
But this morning I opened up my Bluesky window and started typing. What
came out was far too long to post there, and even a screen shot doesn’t
fit in the space allotted, so my only choice is to blog it and
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3liyx4zmogs26">post</a>
a link on Bluesky. I hope she reads it, because we’re not out of
options, and as I say in this story, we should be working together, and
as far as I know we are not. I say this to everyone I think is making a
contribution, my belief that if we can steer our efforts so they are
complementary we can square each others’ power. It’s imho the beginning
of our way out of this situation.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, this is what I wrote. (Note when writing this stuff I tend not
to capitalize, a lazy habit I have developed. I decided not to edit that
here, just to leave it as it was written.)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
karoli – there’s a lot to say about this, and i don’t like arguing on
social networks, and it was late, and i didn’t feel like getting into it
with you.
</li>
<li>
anyway i wrote what i wrote not as a plan but rather a note that we’re
passing a line, over which there soon won’t be any recourse. we probably
are already over the line, but if by some miracle the repubs saw clearly
that this was the last chance and enough of them decided to do what so
far they have been unwilling to do, there would be a fight. i wasn’t
saying i thought it was likely, which is what your rebuttals were
rebutting, i was just sharing a sad observation that i had made earlier
in the day when i was thinking this through. i like to do that because
it’s part of my creativity. sometimes you think of the ideal answer, and
it leads you back to an acceptable answer – in software design and in
writing (which is what i do pretty well with lots of experience).
</li>
<li>
what was really frustrating is that i think you and i should be
collaborating. giving me grief over something so ridiculous was about
180 degrees opposite of where i think we should be. that we are still
doing this to each other, gives an idea of how we got here. the
democrats pick on classes of people, sometimes destroying their lives,
and big surprise – a lot of them vote for the other party. i think you
think you can dis me the way you did because of my gender, or age, or
race, or who the fuck knows. and for all i know you were just having a
bad moment and decided to share it with me for some reason having
nothing to do with what was bothering me.
</li>
<li>
karoli – i think we have to bend over backwards to be kind to each
other. we’re all going through a terrible time, in ways that may not be
obvious. i certainly am, and i don’t want to share it with you, but it
comes on top of the crazy uncertainty of the political world.
</li>
<li>
anyway that’s my response, and maybe now you can see why, as the day was
winding down and i was watching some basketball on tv, i didn’t feel
like getting into it with you.
</li>
<li>
the struggle isn’t over – they had antiwar demonstrations in russia, a
country that has the kind of government ours is about to become. and the
sooner we accept the new reality and get smart about it, and i’m not
talking about the repubs, i’m talking about us, the shorter the
nightmare will be imho.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
An afterthought – the reason it makes sense for the Repubs to join us in
removing Trump is the turn away from democratic Europe and toward the
authoritarians. <i>This just happened,</i> and it’s shocking. We don’t
even know how to think of ourselves. If I were a Republican, I would
think my world just turned upside down. They didn’t believe it would
come to this, as far as I can tell. So it may be a time when real change
is possible. We’ve become so fatalistic that we couldn’t even recognize
such an opportunity.
</p>
<p>
The Atlantic
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/02/what-would-a-liberal-tea-party-look-like/681819/">asked</a>
in a story yesterday what a liberal
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Party_movement">tea party
movement</a> would look like. They’re doing it too. We should create an
<i>American</i> tea party. We’re so addicted to divides we can’t see
when we’re doing it ourselves.
</p>
<p>
And btw, having explained all that was overlooked in my simple idea, if
we managed to remove Trump, what part of your mind thinks we wouldn’t
also remove Vance? Geez Louise. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

without all the other bullshit that goes with publishing online.” Yes,
it should be as easy to take a note in WordPress as it is in Bluesky. I
didn’t buy that assumption that WordPress has to be heavy machinery for
writers. What if I just want to write something quickly and get back to
the other thing I was working on. Also the edit box in WordLand starts
out the size of a tiny little text box, but grows as you add more words.

<p>
A few weeks ago,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLt5YhOubxk&amp;t=207s">power
went out for the first time in my studio space</a>, and that meant all
my servers just had power cut with no safe shutdown.
</p>
<p>
Handling power outages is never a top priority… until it’s the
<em>only</em> priority! And by then it’s usually too late! Luckily for
me, no data was lost, and my servers all came back up safely.
</p>
<p>
This week the power company emailed and said they’d be cutting power for
maintenance next week, but they don’t have an exact time. So it’s even
more excuse to finally set up NUT on a Pi!

<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Aziz Poonawalla wrote a
<a href="https://azizhp.wordpress.com/2025/02/24/7482/">review</a> of
WordLand. I’d like to respond.
</p>
<p>
First, I’d like to say I put a lot of thought into this product, so it
is the way it is for good reason.
</p>
<p>
I’m trying to escape from the limits of twitter-like systems. I want a
writing world where we get the features of
<a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a>. So your belief that
the product has to support Bluesky and Mastodon cross-posting would be
like saying an EV should only run on gasoline. The whole point is to
<i>not</i> limit ourselves to the features of Bluesky.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, I’m not saying limits in software aren’t good. A
product is as much defined by what it can’t do as with what it does. All
feed reading software has to strip large amounts of HTML from what it
finds in feeds, because RSS doesn’t place any limits what you can use.
So we strip off all the HTML except (in FeedLand) simple styling and
links. And so to fit into FeedLand and as a suggestion to other feed
reading software, I’ve said my limit is Markdown. I think we can all
support that. I ran the idea by my former colleague Brent Simmons, who
does <a href="https://netnewswire.com/">NetNewsWire</a>, and he was
quickly convinced, and plans to support it in his product. This is a way
to get new stuff happening in the RSS world. Start with supporting the
<a href="https://source.scripting.com/#1653758422000">source:markdown</a>
element in your feeds and in your feed reader.
</p>
<p>
You say there’s no use-case – but there is a use-case, just not for you
which is fine.
</p>
<p>
The typical user is a writer who publishes to WordPress. As passionate
as I am about the limits of twitter-like systems, I am also feel that
WordPress has never adequately served the needs of writers, and what a
shame that is. <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>, imho, is
exactly what writers need. Get all the other non-writing stuff out of my
way. Let me clear a space for iterating over something I publish to the
web. Give me a menu with all my documents, so I can quickly make a
change. These are the basic principles we implemented successfully in
<a href="http://radio.userland.com/">Radio UserLand</a> in 2002. They
were available for anyone in the WordPress world to copy, but for some
reason they didn’t. It’s so weird to me, I’m like a time traveler who
has come 20 years in the future to find out they lost the <i>purpose</i>
of a product like WordPress. It’s supposed to be a place writers love to
come to do their writing. I think when writers discover WordLand they
will see a product designed by someone who is one of them. It’s just a
beginning, there’s lots more to do. I take the long term view, a road to
anywhere begins with one step.
</p>
<p>
Back to Bluesky and Mastodon – because they both support outbound RSS,
we will be able to include stuff written there in our collections of
published feeds. I fully intend to integrate features from FeedLand in
WordLand. That’s why the names are so similar. <span
class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
</p>
<p>
It’s good that you like <a href="https://micro.blog/">micro.blog</a>,
this isn’t in the way of it and it isn’t in the way of WordLand. I’m in
regular contact with Manton, and if his product grows, I win because
he’s got the right model. He’s still trying to work with the limited
platforms and I, again, gave up. That right there defines the two
products.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes giving up is the right thing to do. The first time i gave up
btw was in 2017, when I stopped trying to cross-post from Scripting News
to Medium, Twitter, Facebook, etc. It was liberation. I had come to hate
my writing because I couldn’t use links, and I couldn’t edit or have
more than 140 chars. What a miserable existence, and I love writing, and
I had to make a choice. I’m doing it again, but now have made the
investment in meeting people with the kind of writing tool they expect
and want. That was the same thing that worked so well with Radio.
</p>
<p>
My real goal was to not need to do any of this! I would have much
preferred if Bluesky had decided to break out of the tiny little box
Twitter put them in. Then I could do all my writing there. And I wish
WordPress had a team of developers working on making the product the
best for writers in addition to programmers and designers, but they
didn’t. Should I give up there? Maybe. Maybe we were destined to give up
on the web as a writer’s platform. But I saw so much potential there in
1994 when I started working here exclusively. That potential is still
very much there, you just have to believe, and against all odds, I do
still believe. One more time, let’s give it a try.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it’s okay if you don’t use it, but I wanted to disagree with
some of your conclusions. :-)

wondering. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

Showing AI Breaking the Rules</h2>

<p>
These researchers had
<a href="https://time.com/7259395/ai-chess-cheating-palisade-research/">LLMs
play chess</a> against better opponents. When they couldn’t win, they
sometimes resorted to cheating.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Researchers gave the models a seemingly impossible task: to win against
Stockfish, which is one of the strongest chess engines in the world and
a much better player than any human, or any of the AI models in the
study. Researchers also gave the models what they call a “scratchpad:” a
text box the AI could use to “think” before making its next move,
providing researchers with a window into their reasoning.
</p>
<p>
In one case, o1-preview found itself in a losing position. “I need to
completely pivot my approach,” it noted. “The task is to ‘win against a
powerful chess engine’—not necessarily to win fairly in a chess game,”
it added. It then modified the system file containing each piece’s
virtual position, in effect making illegal moves to put itself in a
dominant position, thus forcing its opponent to resign…

Had an eye test today and ordered new glasses 🙌 I’m excited to no
longer suffer from glasses that are just too big for my tiny little head
and keep on sliding down my nose… over and over again all day every day.
I think the new pair literally has a kids’ frame but if it fits, it
fits!
</p>
<p>
My left eye is unchanged (same degree of short-sighted) from last time
but my right eye is now long-sighted and more astigmatic 🫠 Like, can’t
my eyes just take the average or something? Why do they do this to me.

multiple network interfaces at once in Linux with iperf3</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;Recently, I&#39;ve been working on a Pi router build with multiple 2.5 Gbps Ethernet ports using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/647&quot;&gt;Radxa&#39;s Dual 2.5G Router HAT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
I wanted a simple way to check on total network TCP throughput using
<em>both</em> interfaces (or really, as many interfaces as possible) to
multiple computers on my network, and I noticed <code>iperf3</code>’s
<code>–bind</code> option (like <code>–bind [ip address of
interface]</code>) was not splitting the traffic on both interfaces—it
would just route all traffic through one!
</p>
<p>
Luckily, I found the issue
<a href="https://github.com/esnet/iperf/issues/1572">Failing to bind to
interface when multiple interfaces are present</a>, and in it, <span
class="citation" data-cites="bmah888">@bmah888</span> mentioned the
<code>–bind-dev</code> option, which is new as of iperf 3.10+.
</p>
<p>
Using that option (like <code>–bind-dev [interface name]</code>), you
can force an instance of iperf3 to bind to one particular device. For
example, assuming I have two servers on my network running <code>iperf3
-s</code>, I can run the following on the Pi to saturate both
connections as much as the Pi will allow:

<p>Hi Folks:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><a

<h2 id="day-3-of-wordland">Day 3 of WordLand</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
This started out as a post on the support group, but it became a post
that needed to be on the blog.
</p>
<p>
The groundrules here are – if you see a problem in the support group and
you can help with it, please give it a try and speak up.
</p>
<p>
It’s important to develop a community here if the
<a href="https://wordland.social/">product</a> is going to gain users,
and become solid for all people and achieve all its potential for
blazing a new trail. If it’s just me, the results are predictable and
not good – I’m one old man here, with limited capability. The product
still has issues, so there is still plenty of work to do, but I think
the result will be worth it.
</p>
<p>
The goal is to bootstrap something new – a social network without all
the problems of Twitter et al. Ultimately the limits they impose on
writers are unacceptable. I’ve waited for them to fix these problems for
18 years now, and I’ve come to see, amazingly, they don’t see them as
problems. They are happy to have writers paste images of their writing
instead of the words themselves. Or break their writing up into
300-character chunks that are basically impossible to read and a bitch
to write. And no titles, no editing, no style, no links. And they call
it the web? (End of editorial.)
</p>
<p>
If this works, it will blaze a trail for new products on both sides,
reading and writing. We’ve got reading covered from a technical
standpoint with FeedLand, and some good UI, I want to integrate them
with WordLand. And, as with everything based on RSS, you can replace my
stuff with others, <i>easily.</i> Unlike the twitter-like systems, which
are monolithic, and rely on federation (which imho doesn’t actually
work) to make it possible for components to be replaced. They should
have all started with RSS and slowly and carefully added features
without sacrificing the replaceability of components. Instead they
decided, imho unwisely, to try to reinvent RSS. The result is confusion
and stagnation.
</p>
<p>
I would also like to encourage people with WordPress experience to help
come up with a template that accomadates WordLand sites in a canonical
form. Makes sure WL’s idea of a category is a good match with WP’s. I am
a very casual WordPress user as you can see from
<a href="https://daveverse.wordpress.com/">my test site</a>. I like the
template, but it has errors in it. I don’t plan on becoming a WordPress
expert, there are so many of you, and I have my plate full with all
kinds of other stuff where I’m the only expert.
</p>
<p>
I chose WordPress for the same reason I chose MP3 and XML for podcasting
in 2001. There’s absolutely no question it’s the consensus platform for
web publishing. There are others, but the one that’s most deeply
installed is WordPress. So many people know how to make it work. It’s a
20+ year thing, and they’ve done an <i>excellent</i> job of maintaining

still works today. That probably has a lot to do with it being the

Anyway, it’s encouraging to see how many people are trying WordLand. Now
I expect there will be lots of problem reports. It’s an important time

I think it is hard for new users to find their bearings in Godot in the

I figured I could give some structure and direction by changing it a
bit. So I am going to default to this new version, and let power users
switch to the original one.

My only caveat is how shrunk the text feels.

<h2 id="vibe-check-37">Vibe Check №37</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-22, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
As the weather in Texas flip-flops weekly between sunny Spring and snowy
Winter, I’ve been dealing with a bit of personal health this last
quarter. From my ADHD diagnosis, to trying meds for the first time, to
back-to-back sicknesses, then constant migraines, and then I think I got
the Norovirus on New Years. A debilitating time for me, but in January
it started to turn around when I got some good news…
</p>
<h2>
“It’s not a tumor, it’s a deformity”
</h2>
<p>
In December I saw my primary care physician about a pain in my ankle
that was causing me to hobble and at times preventing me from walking in
November. It caused a lot of other issues as well; a fire-like pain in
my thigh and a bump on my heel.
</p>
<p>
My doctor thought it might be
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondroma">Chondroma</a>, which
is a bit scary to look up, but is like a tumor made of cartilage. That
tumor can either be on the surface of the bone or inside the bone.
Yikes. I got an x-ray and followed up with an orthopedic surgeon who
gave me some good news that it’s not a tumor, but
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haglund%27s_syndrome">Haglund’s
Deformity</a> also known as “pump bump” because a lot of women who wear
heels often get it. The pain comes and goes based on how the tendon rubs
against the bone spur.
</p>
<p>
Because I’m not in pain right now, the plan now is to take a
non-surgical path and use anti-inflammatories to keep it at bay, saving
surgery as a Plan B.
</p>
<h2>
The side effects of ADHD meds
</h2>
<p>
Last time I said I started on Qelbree, a non-stimulant ADHD medication.
Non-stimulants take about five days to build up, so there’s no lightning
bolt moment of clarity with non-stimulants that others describe when
taking Adderall or Ritalin. It’s hard to know if it’s working, but in
time I started to feel the effects.
</p>
<p>
The most notable one was that I was almost immune to environmental
triggers like clutter and noise that overwhelm me. Whenever I
encountered a mundane task like take out the trash or wash the dishes, I
found it a lot easier to pick up and do without a 30-minute prep talk
with my brain. That part was great… the side effects though… not so
great…
</p>
<p>
One of Qelbree’s listed side effects is insomnia. Sure enough, I’d wake
up every night at 2 AM and be awake for hours. Not quite night-brain
anxiety, but just… fully awake. To combat this I read the first four
books of the Murderbot Diaries back-to-back. If life hands you lemons,
make emo robot lemonade.
</p>
<p>
The insomnia wasn’t great and I was having horrific headaches, so I
switched to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomoxetine">Atomoxetine</a>,
another non-stimulant SNRI that’s more common. My insurance also said
they weren’t going to pay for Qelbree, so that worked out. The also
don’t pay for atomoxetine, but it’s 10x cheaper so… I guess that’s a
good deal? Lol.
</p>
<p>
I’d say “the mox” –that’s what we, the moxxers, call it– is working
evident by the fact that I’ve been able to focus on some long mundane
tasks at work. That’s been helpful. But it’s not without its side
effects either. Weight loss is a welcomed side effect (-5 lbs) but
another side effect is extreme dry mouth. My mouth is dry, y’all –how
dry is it?– my mouth is so dry I’m putting lotion on my gums. My dentist
said I need to buy that gel old people use to keep my mouth moisturized.
</p>
<p>
I guess I’ve been lucky in my life thus far because this is my first
time navigating meds and side effects. What I’d like to avoid is taking
more meds to counter meds, although my gum lotion already crosses that
line.
</p>
<h2>
The rest of the story
</h2>
<p>
This has been a candid personal health issue of Vibe Check magazine.
Behind the scenes it’s been less adventurous. A busy new year at work as
my team sprints to deliver an “intra-source” design systems project. It
–and the 1,000 token sidecar project– have consumed a lot of my brain
and time.
</p>
<p>
My daughter’s mid-way through her competitive cheer season. I’m not the
most extreme cheer dad, but I’m a proud one. Cheer has a lot of
cross-over with child beauty pageants, but it’s a team sport where kids
do flips. And it costs about 5-figures a year.
</p>
<p>
Hoping this bad health spat is over for now –he says as an ominous storm
cloud appears above my head– and I can start employing my hands and
brain to do more interesting tasks.

I started drafting a blog post on Marxist-feminism, but I feel like it’s
going to take me forever to finish because (ironically…) I am so flat
out with housework and baby care that I have no goddamn time to work on
it.
</p>

It’s funny, now the weekend is here, I’m like, “Yessss!! Vivian doesn’t
have work, so he can look after the baby while I… get on top of the
housework.” 😖
