Showing AI Breaking the Rules</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, updated: 2025-02-24, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
These researchers had
<a href="https://time.com/7259395/ai-chess-cheating-palisade-research/">LLMs
play chess</a> against better opponents. When they couldn‚Äôt win, they
sometimes resorted to cheating.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Researchers gave the models a seemingly impossible task: to win against
Stockfish, which is one of the strongest chess engines in the world and
a much better player than any human, or any of the AI models in the
study. Researchers also gave the models what they call a ‚Äúscratchpad:‚Äù a
text box the AI could use to ‚Äúthink‚Äù before making its next move,
providing researchers with a window into their reasoning.
</p>
<p>
In one case, o1-preview found itself in a losing position. ‚ÄúI need to
completely pivot my approach,‚Äù it noted. ‚ÄúThe task is to ‚Äòwin against a
powerful chess engine‚Äô‚Äînot necessarily to win fairly in a chess game,‚Äù
it added. It then modified the system file containing each piece‚Äôs
virtual position, in effect making illegal moves to put itself in a
dominant position, thus forcing its opponent to resign‚Ä¶

multiple network interfaces at once in Linux with iperf3</h2>

<p><span
class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Benchmarking
multiple network interfaces at once in Linux with iperf3</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;Recently, I&#39;ve been working on a Pi router build with multiple 2.5 Gbps Ethernet ports using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/647&quot;&gt;Radxa&#39;s Dual 2.5G Router HAT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
I wanted a simple way to check on total network TCP throughput using
<em>both</em> interfaces (or really, as many interfaces as possible) to
multiple computers on my network, and I noticed <code>iperf3</code>‚Äôs
<code>‚Äìbind</code> option (like <code>‚Äìbind [ip address of
interface]</code>) was not splitting the traffic on both interfaces‚Äîit
would just route all traffic through one!
</p>
<p>
Luckily, I found the issue
<a href="https://github.com/esnet/iperf/issues/1572">Failing to bind to
interface when multiple interfaces are present</a>, and in it, <span
class="citation" data-cites="bmah888">@bmah888</span> mentioned the
<code>‚Äìbind-dev</code> option, which is new as of iperf 3.10+.
</p>
<p>
Using that option (like <code>‚Äìbind-dev [interface name]</code>), you
can force an instance of iperf3 to bind to one particular device. For
example, assuming I have two servers on my network running <code>iperf3
-s</code>, I can run the following on the Pi to saturate both
connections as much as the Pi will allow:

<h2 id="day-3-of-wordland">Day 3 of WordLand</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
This started out as a post on the support group, but it became a post
that needed to be on the blog.
</p>
<p>
The groundrules here are ‚Äì if you see a problem in the support group and
you can help with it, please give it a try and speak up.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs important to develop a community here if the
<a href="https://wordland.social/">product</a> is going to gain users,
and become solid for all people and achieve all its potential for
blazing a new trail. If it‚Äôs just me, the results are predictable and
not good ‚Äì I‚Äôm one old man here, with limited capability. The product
still has issues, so there is still plenty of work to do, but I think
the result will be worth it.
</p>
<p>
The goal is to bootstrap something new ‚Äì a social network without all
the problems of Twitter et al.¬†Ultimately the limits they impose on
writers are unacceptable. I‚Äôve waited for them to fix these problems for
18 years now, and I‚Äôve come to see, amazingly, they don‚Äôt see them as
problems. They are happy to have writers paste images of their writing
instead of the words themselves. Or break their writing up into
300-character chunks that are basically impossible to read and a bitch
to write. And no titles, no editing, no style, no links. And they call
it the web? (End of editorial.)
</p>
<p>
If this works, it will blaze a trail for new products on both sides,
reading and writing. We‚Äôve got reading covered from a technical
standpoint with FeedLand, and some good UI, I want to integrate them
with WordLand. And, as with everything based on RSS, you can replace my
stuff with others, <i>easily.</i> Unlike the twitter-like systems, which
are monolithic, and rely on federation (which imho doesn‚Äôt actually
work) to make it possible for components to be replaced. They should
have all started with RSS and slowly and carefully added features
without sacrificing the replaceability of components. Instead they
decided, imho unwisely, to try to reinvent RSS. The result is confusion
and stagnation.
</p>
<p>
I would also like to encourage people with WordPress experience to help
come up with a template that accomadates WordLand sites in a canonical
form. Makes sure WL‚Äôs idea of a category is a good match with WP‚Äôs. I am
a very casual WordPress user as you can see from
<a href="https://daveverse.wordpress.com/">my test site</a>. I like the
template, but it has errors in it. I don‚Äôt plan on becoming a WordPress
expert, there are so many of you, and I have my plate full with all
kinds of other stuff where I‚Äôm the only expert.
</p>
<p>
I chose WordPress for the same reason I chose MP3 and XML for podcasting
in 2001. There‚Äôs absolutely no question it‚Äôs the consensus platform for
web publishing. There are others, but the one that‚Äôs most deeply
installed is WordPress. So many people know how to make it work. It‚Äôs a
20+ year thing, and they‚Äôve done an <i>excellent</i> job of maintaining
compatibility. Stuff we developed that worked with WordPress in the 00s
still works today. That probably has a lot to do with it being the
consensus.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it‚Äôs encouraging to see how many people are trying WordLand. Now
I expect there will be lots of problem reports. It‚Äôs an important time
when help is needed.
</p>
<p>
Dave

<p>We should be declaring independence from both political parties. We

Follow up: once you become a regular vivino user (just snap a picture
every time you drink something), it helps to pick cheap wines that you
will enjoy nonetheless.
