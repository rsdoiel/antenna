<p>
</p>
<p>
I put up the antenna after realizing how indoor GPS reception is just
never that great, due to a variety of factors (like multipath
propagation and interference), even if I placed my antennas up in the
plenum space right under the roof. Of course, it doesn’t help that my
studio has a metal roof :)

2025-05-15 Driving to Grabovac
</h1>
<p>
Today not much happened. We ate breakfast, packed our stuff and drove to
Grabovac. Claudia does all the driving. The roads were narrow and
progress was slow. The 125km took us a long time. And when we arrived,
we had a siesta two hours long.
</p>
<p>
Claudia isn’t feeling too well. At first we thought she had picked up a
stomach bug somewhere but then we saw that the bottled water she was
drinking (Donat) contained 1000mg of magnesium! She drank one and half
litres of it for a few days. And as they say, beyond 250mg/day it starts
getting weird and closer to 2500mg/day it gets dangerous.
</p>
<p>
When stopping for a snack in the autobahn, we like the pistachio
croissant which we cannot get in Switzerland.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-grabovac-1.jpg" alt="croissant with green stuff on it" />
</p>
<p>
Around dinner the weather starts turning bad. Storm clouds and rain. It
will be cold, tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-grabovac-2.jpg" alt="a swimming pool with dark clouds overhead" />
</p>
<p>
Walking around the property, we saw these huge flowers along with some
irises.

<h1 id="2025-05-14-crikvenica">
2025-05-14 Crikvenica
</h1>
<p>
Today was a no-car day and we went for a hike. First we walked along the
coast to the neighbouring village of Dramalji, then up the hill and over
a pass to Tribalj, then back along the Dubračina back to Crikvenica.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to OsmAnd for the navigation and Flora Incognita for identifying
the plants late at night.
</p>
<p>
Pictures by Claudia and me.
</p>
<p>
We started along the coast, on that one-way street.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-1.jpg" alt="a street with a one-way sign" />
</p>
<p>
Across the sea you can see the island of Krk. We did not have the time
to visit.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-2.jpg" alt="Alex and Claudia grinning at the camera, both wearing hats and sunglasses" />
</p>
<p>
When there are no sandy beaches, concrete slabs dot the coast for
roasting tourists in summer.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-3.jpg" alt="empty concrete platforms by the sea" />
</p>
<p>
I like the rocks without the construction work but I guess it’s harder
to get into the water.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-36.jpg" alt="The rocky coast without construction works" />
</p>
<p>
Then we started the ascent.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-4.jpg" alt="stairs going up" />
</p>
<p>
We always stop for new flowers along the way! This one grew out of a
stone wall.
</p>
<p>
Garten-Löwenmaul<br> Antirrhinum majus
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-5.jpg" alt="purple flowers" />
</p>
<p>
Further up, more flowers grew along the way.
</p>
<p>
Strahlen-Breitsame<br> Orlaya grandiflora
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-6.jpg" alt="white flowers" />
</p>
<p>
Even further up, we entered a landscape of salvia. This was simply the
first one, growing next to the trail.
</p>
<p>
Echter Salbei<br> Salvia officinalis
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-7.jpg" alt="violet flowers" />
</p>
<p>
Up and up, leaving the town behind. Sometimes, stonewalls line the
trail.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-8.jpg" alt="dry stone walls to the left and right of the trail" />
</p>
<p>
Then the walls disappear and the sun bakes us.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-9.jpg" alt="the trail is overgrown with white and yellow flowers" />
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-37.jpg" alt="looks like a hornet but it is a wasp" />
</p>
<p>
The trail is made up of broken white rocks.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-10.jpg" alt="Claudia looking back at me" />
</p>
<p>
Looking back towards the sea and the island of Krk. It’s still steep
going.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-11.jpg" alt="rough gravel trail and the ocean in the distance" />
</p>
<p>
Crepis neglecta
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-12.jpg" alt="yellow flowers" />
</p>
<p>
The trail keeps climbing. We started at sea level and the pass is at
about 300 and something meters above the sea.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-13.jpg" alt="Pine trees, gravel trail, no shade" />
</p>
<p>
I don’t remember seeing a purple variant.
</p>
<p>

<p>

</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-15.jpg" alt="violet flowers" />

<p>
This is what it looks like when I’m taking pictures.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Flora Incognita seems to be very unsure about this one, but we saw it a
lot. Milchstern or Ornithogalum seems good to me, but which one?
</p>
<p>
Ornithogalum baeticum
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-20.jpg" alt="brushes, grass, stones" />
</p>
<p>
We call it tick country. 😰

<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-42.jpg" alt="sage meadow" />
</p>
<p>
Far behind us, the sea is still visible. We keep on walking.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-24.jpg" alt="Brushes, stones" />

</p>
<p>
We finally reached the other side.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-44.jpg" alt="a lake at the bottom of the valley" />
</p>
<p>
The biome changed again. The forest is cooler and the ground is no
longer dry.
</p>
<p>
Pfirsichblättrige Glockenblume<br> Campanula persicifolia
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-28.jpg" alt="violet flowers" />
</p>
<p>
The trail is pretty steep!
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-29.jpg" alt="Claudia on the trail" />
</p>
<p>
Luckily, there is a lot of shade.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-30.jpg" alt="A forest with slender trees and green canopy" />
</p>
<p>
Markings are good. We lost our way once, at the top of the pass, ending
up at a plaque commemorating the fight against fascism in 1945 and 1956,
I guess. I couldn’t actually read anything except the years. We turned
back and soon found our way.
</p>
<p>
Is this the partisan trail?
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-45.jpg" alt="dry stone wall with a hiking trail marker" />

</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-31.jpg" alt="And more violet flowers" />
</p>
<p>
We finally reached the little river that will take us back!
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-32.jpg" alt="a river, three or four meters wide" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-33.jpg" alt="the river doesn&rsquo;t carry much water, the trees grow bigger" />
</p>
<p>
Claudia spotted two snakes!
</p>
<p>
At this point the river only runs beneath the rocks. For long stretches
it disappears completely.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-34.jpg" alt="here is Claudia trying to take a picture of the snake" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-47.jpg" alt="a long black snake with its head in the grass" />
</p>
<p>
Every now and then we see a bunch of yellow irises like the ones we have
on our balcony, which we got from Claudia’s parents’ garden pond.
</p>
<p>
Gelbe Schwertlilie<br> Iris pseudacorus
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-35.jpg" alt="Giant yellow flowers" />
</p>
<p>
And we keep on walking!
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-46.jpg" alt="Alex walking along the river" />
</p>
<p>
And we’re on the end stretch! 😅
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-14-crikvenica-48.jpg" alt="a bridge over the dry river" />
</p>
<p>
<strong>Content warning: ticks!</strong>
</p>
<p>
Remember how we joked about being on the tick trail? When we came back,
we ate ice-cream, we went for a swim in the ocean, we went to the sauna,
to the whirlpool, back to the sauna, back the hotel room, and a tick
fell of my stuff as I stepped on the balcony! 😱 And then we examined
each other and I found a tick on my wife! 😱 😱 Both ticks were still
“empty” but that really feeds our paranoia. Now we’re examining all our
clothes from all sides before putting them on and I <em>hate</em> that
feeling.

On Sunday 4<sup>th</sup> May Vicky &amp; I saw
<a href="https://www.berkeleyrep.org/shows/here-there-are-blueberries/">Berkeley
Rep’s production</a> of a thought-provoking new play by Moisés Kaufman,
Amanda Gronich, and Tectonic Theater, the team behind
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Laramie_Project"><i>The
Laramie Project</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
about the reaction to the 1998 murder of gay University of Wyoming
student Matthew Shepard in Laramie, Wyoming. The murder was denounced as
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_crime">hate crime</a> and
brought attention to the lack of hate crime laws in various states,
including
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming">Wyoming</a>.<br />
<br /> An example of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_theatre#Verbatim_theatre">verbatim
theatre</a>, the play draws on hundreds of interviews conducted by the
theatre company with inhabitants of the town, company members’ own
journal entries, and published news reports.
</blockquote>
The new play, <a href="https://www.heretherareblueberries.com/"><i>Here
There Are Blueberries</i></a>, is on tour after a 2022 premiere at the
La Jolla Playhouse and a 2024 run at the New York Theatre Workshop.
Vinson Cunningham reviewed the New York production in
<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/05/27/here-there-are-blueberries-theatre-review"><i>The
Chilling Truth Pictured in “Here There Are Blueberries”</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
There’s something awful about a lost picture. Maybe it’s because of a
disparity between your original hope and the result: you made the
photograph because you intended to keep it, and now that
intention—artistic, memorial, historical—is fugitive, on the run toward
ends other than your own. The picture, gone forever, possibly revived by
strange eyes, will never again mean quite what you thought it would.
</blockquote>
The play dramatizes the process archivists at the US Holocaust Memorial
Museum went through to investigate an album of photographs taken at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp">Auschwitz</a>.
Photographs from Auschwitz are extremely rare because the Nazis didn’t
want evidence of what happened there to survive.<br /> <br /> Below the
fold I discuss the play and some of the thoughts it provoked that are
relevant to digital preservation.<br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span>

I’ve been interested in verbatim theatre for a long time, Not just the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Laramie_Project"><i>The
Laramie Project</i></a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Laramie_Project:_Ten_Years_Later"><i>The
Laramie Project: Ten Years Later</i></a>, but also the work of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Deavere_Smith">Anna Deavere
Smith</a>, David Hare’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Permanent_Way"><i>The
Permanent Way</i></a>, and the amazing verbatim musical
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Road_(musical)"><i>London
Road</i></a>.<br /> <br /> Developing one of these plays is a
painstaking process, The actors conduct extended interviews with the
people they will represent, and the playwrights select and organize
quotes from the interviews. And, in the case of <i>London Road</i>, set
them to music.<br /> <br /> In this case most of the participants were
archivists at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum who, in 2006, received an
offer to donate an album of photographs from Auschwitz. Initially
skeptical, archivist Rebecca Erbelding rapidly established that the more
than 100 images in the album documented the life of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Friedrich_H%C3%B6cker">Karl-Friedrich
Höcker</a> during the period from May to December 1944 when he served as
the adjutant to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Baer_(Nazi)">Richard
Baer</a>, the last commandant of Auschwitz. Thus the album became known
as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B6cker_Album">Höcker
Album</a>.<br /> <br />

The archivists were immediately struck by the lack of any images of camp
inmates. Instead, many images showed camp staff relaxing at a resort the
inmates constructed for the camp called the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solah%C3%BCtte">Solahütte</a>.
Time off at the Solahütte was a reward for good performance. Höcker is
seen at the Solahütte:<br />
<blockquote>
in the company of young women—stenographers and typists, trained at the
SS school in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obernai">Obernai</a>, who were
known generally as

Many of the images showed Höcker with more senior SS officers including

with the children floating in the home’s pool in a boat the inmates made
for them.<br /> <br /> The survival of the album is remarkable. A US
Army counter-intelligence officer was assigned to Frankfurt in the
aftermath of the war. His story is that, unable to find a official
billet, he occupied an abandoned apartment in whose trash he found the
album. It wasn’t until 2006, six decades later, that he offered it to
the US Holocaust Memorial Museum.<br /> <br />

One image shows a group of about 70 soldiers at the Solahütte
celebrating. It was discovered that they were celebrating the conclusion
of the operation led by Adolf Eichmann to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust_in_Hungary">exterminate
the Hungarian Jews from Carpathian Ruthenia</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Between 15 May and 9 July 1944, over 434,000 Jews were deported on 147
trains, most of them to Auschwitz, where about 80 percent were gassed on
arrival.
</blockquote>
Despite the celebration, the operation was less than completely
successful. Before it was stopped by Miklós Horthy, the Regent of
Hungary, it had only succeeded in transporting about 434,000 of
Hungary’s about 825,000 Jews, and killing about 350,000 of them.<br />

Strangely, the arrival of one of the trains is documented in the only
other known album of photographs from Auschwitz, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_Album"><i>Auschwitz
Album</i></a>. The images:<br />
<blockquote>
document the disembarkation of the Jewish prisoners from the train
boxcars, followed by the selection process, performed by doctors of the
SS and wardens of the camp, which separated those who were considered
fit for work from those who were to be sent to the gas chambers. The
photographers followed groups of those selected for work, and those
selected for death, to a birch grove just outside the crematoria, where
they were made to wait before being killed.
</blockquote>
The Auschwitz Album’s survival is
<a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/auschwitz-through-the-lens-of-the-ss-a-tale-of-two-albums?series=12">equally
remarkable</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The original owner of that album, Lili Jacob (later Zelmanovic Meier),
was deported with her family to
<a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/narrative/3673/en">Auschwitz</a>
in late May 1944 from Bilke (today: Bil’ki, Ukraine), a small town near
Berehovo in Transcarpathian Rus which was then part of Hungary. They
arrived on May 26, 1944, the same day that professional SS photographers
photographed the arrival of the train and the selection process. Richard
Baer and Karl Höcker arrived at Auschwitz mere days before the arrival
of this transport. After surviving Auschwitz, forced labor in
Morchenstern, a
<a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/narrative/6074/en">Gross-Rosen</a>
subcamp, and transfer to
<a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/narrative/4909/en">Dora-Mittelbau</a>
where she was liberated, Lili Jacob discovered an album containing these
photographs in a drawer of a bedside table in an abandoned SS barracks
while she was recovering from typhus.
</blockquote>
Because it was taken the day Jacob arrived,
<a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/auschwitz-through-the-lens-of-the-ss-a-tale-of-two-albums?series=12">she</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
first found a photograph of her rabbi but then also discovered a photo
of herself, many of her neighbors, and relatives, including a famous
shot of her two younger brothers Yisrael and Zelig Jacob.
</blockquote>
She took the album with her as she immigrated to the United States. In
1983 she donated it to <a href="https://www.yadvashem.org/">Yad
Vashem</a>, after which it was published.<br /> <br />

The title of the play, “Here There Are Blueberries”, is the caption of a
series of images showing Höcker serving blueberries to a group of
Helferinnen at the Solahütte.<br /> <br /> Höcker served 18 months in a
British POW camp before resuming his pre-war life as a bank cashier. In
1963 he was tried in Frankfurt and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Friedrich_H%C3%B6cker#Post-war_trials">sentenced
to 7 years</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Höcker denied having participated in the selection of victims at
Birkenau or having ever personally executed a prisoner. He further
denied any knowledge of the fate of the approximately 400,000 Hungarian
Jews who were murdered at Auschwitz during his term of service at the
camp. Höcker was shown to have knowledge of the genocidal activities at
the camp, but could not be proved to have played a direct part in them.
In post-war trials, Höcker denied his involvement in the selection
process. While accounts from survivors and other SS officers all but
placed him there, prosecutors could locate no conclusive evidence to
prove the claim.
</blockquote>
In 1989 he was tried again and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Friedrich_H%C3%B6cker#Post-war_trials">sentenced
to 4 years</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
On 3 May 1989 a district court in the German city of Bielefeld sentenced
Höcker to four years imprisonment for his involvement in gassing murders
of prisoners, primarily Polish Jews, in the Majdanek concentration camp
in Poland. Camp records showed that between May 1943 and May 1944 Höcker
had acquired at least 3,610 kilograms of Zyklon B poisonous gas for use
in Majdanek from the Hamburg firm of Tesch &amp; Stabenow.
</blockquote>
Obviously, many of the thoughts provoked by the play are relevant to
current events, about how one would have behaved and how bureaucrats can
compartmentalize their lives so as to claim ignorance of the activities
they administer, as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Friedrich_H%C3%B6cker#Post-war_trials">Höcker
did in his first trial</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
I only learned about the events in Birkenau…in the course of time I was
there… and I had nothing to do with that. I had no ability to influence
these events in any way…neither did I want them, nor carry them out. I
didn’t hurt anybody… and neither did anyone die at Auschwitz because of
me.
</blockquote>
<p>The other set of thoughts are relevant to digital preservation.
Obviously, the negatives of the photographs in the two albums did not
survive. Individual prints from the negatives did not survive. The
images survive because in both cases a set of prints was selected and
bound into an album, which protected them. Once the albums had been
discovered, their survival for many decades was well within the
capabilities of the officer and the survivor. “Benign neglect” was all
that was needed. A few of the prints suffered visible water damage, but
this didn’t impair their value as historical documents.<br /> <br />
Compared to WW2, many more images and videos documenting the events
currently under way in Ukraine, Gaza, Myanmar, Syria, and many other
places are being captured. But they are captured in digital form, and
this makes their survival over enough decades to be used in war crimes
trials and as the basis for histories unlikely. They may be collected
into “albums” on physical media or in cloud services, but neither
provides the protection of a physical album. The survival for many
decades of such digital albums is well beyond the capabilities of those
who took, or who found them. This fact should allow the perpetrators of
today’s atrocities to sleep much easier at night.<br /> <br /> Before
they were delivered to preservation experts the survivor and the officer
had custody of their albums for four and six decades respectively. Four
decades is way longer than the expected service life of any digital
medium in common use; images and video on physical media require the
custodian proactively to migrate them to new media at intervals. “Benign
neglect” does not pay the rent for cloud storage, and trusting to the
whims of the free cloud storage services is likely to be neglect but
hardly benign.<br /> <br /> To improve the chances of current-day albums
analogous to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_Album">Auschwitz
Album</a> and the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B6cker_Album">Höcker
Album</a> we need a consumer-grade long-lived storage medium that is
cheap enough for everyday use. Alas, for the reasons I set out in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/03/archival-storage.html"><i>Archival
Storage</i></a>, we are extremely unlikely to get it.<br /> <br /></p>

<p>
On April 14, Dubai’s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al
Maktoum, <a href="https://x.com/HHShkMohd/status/1911795135039635659">announced</a> that
the United Arab Emirates would begin
using <a href="https://x.com/UAEmediaoffice/status/1911809411577684257">artificial
intelligence</a> to help write its laws. A new Regulatory Intelligence
Office would use the technology to “regularly suggest updates” to the
law and “accelerate the issuance of legislation by up to 70%.” AI would
create a “comprehensive legislative plan” spanning local and federal law
and would be connected to public administration, the courts, and global
policy trends.
</p>
<p>
The plan was widely greeted with astonishment. This sort of AI
legislating would be a global “…

2025-05-13 Opatija, Crikvenica
</h1>
<p>
We stopped in Opatija. The settlement along a lake along a steep hill
reminded me of Lausanne or Neufchâtel in Switzerland. There were hollow
ruins as well as fancy new Grand Hotels, some with an ancient Viennese
flair. To me, that’s weird. To chase the colonised past for tourism
cash? 🫤 Didn’t the Austrians use Croatian troops to out down Italian
revolts and the like? Well, after the Austro-Hungarian empire fell
apart, the Italians took over Opatija but then the communists pushed
them ought.
</p>
<p>
Visiting former Yugoslavia is dreadful from a history perspective
because when I was a teenager the civil war and the breakup of the
country was always there, in the back of my mind. Watching
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warriors_(1999_TV_series)">Warriors</a>
many years later was the worst, though.
</p>
<p>
Hearing so many Austrians on the streets is weird.
</p>
<p>
I guess I felt a little bit of Austrian empire shame. 😳

though.

Crikvenica is very different, with sand beaches, many cafés, pizzerias
and ice-cream parlours. And everything is so green.

conditioning. It was only at 3:00 that our foggy brains thought of
opening the window and leeti g the cool sea breeze in. 🙄

<a href="https://justinjackson.ca/youtube-kill-podcasting">podcasts</a>
are built-in and not going anywhere. Here’s why. As long as there are
lots of good podcasts available for listening to via RSS on phones,
every competitive ’caster is going to want to be there, because their
competitors are. And as long as I can get a good selection of
interesting stuff to listen to on my phone, there’s no reason look
elsewhere. And as far as I know I can’t listen to a YouTube “podcast” in
my car or when walking. One more thing, please stop using death
metaphors re RSS. Learn how
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2017/jul/20/the-power-of-framing-its-not-what-you-say-its-how-you-say-it">framing</a>
works. A few nasty people in the early 00s did a number on RSS and
started putting that awful word next to RSS. It was a way of earning
points from the people who ran Twitter and tech conferences like SXSW,
basically asshole-like people who wanted to close the door on the open
web. And now here we are 2.5 decades later and people are <i>still</i>
doing it. You should self-censor on that one, those people are
long-gone, probably doing stuff with crypto or nuzzling up to oligarchs,
and you’re keeping their asshole-ness alive. That’s pretty fucked
up.</p>

<p>I wanted to design a Google Form, and thought to ask ChatGPT for
instructions from a spec I wrote. Then I thought to ask Gemini, which is
Google’s chatbot, wondering if they would just do the work for me
instead of providing instructions. I would have laughed out loud if they
did, but alas, <a href="https://g.co/gemini/share/add0560b6b02">just
instructions</a>. Eventually they will do that for you.</p>

<p>date: 2025-05-14, from: Enlightenment Economics blog</p>

reasons of general busy-ness. The last thing I want to do of an evening
or lunchbreak is more sitting at my screen, especially in such lovely

<h2 id="about-the-baseline-theme">About the Baseline theme</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-14, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Scott Hanson has been working on the
<a href="https://wordland.shanson.de/2025/05/13/how-to-install-baseline/">Baseline
theme</a> and it’s ready for people to try out.
</p>
<p>
An important caveat. This theme was designed to be the beginning theme
for WordLand-authored WordPress sites.
</p>
<p>
The goal is to get the minimal features for a nice blog-oriented site
running in WordPress.
</p>
<p>
It’s open source, so you can start with Baseline and add all the
features you want.
</p>
<p>
And Scott has said he’d be happy to work with others to make it so that
it would be great for presenting non-WordLand-authored writing.
</p>
<p>
As the developer of <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>, I
wanted to go back to the beginning and take fresh a approach to the way
blogs implement various features in 2025. It’s been a long time since we
took a fresh look, and lots has happened since. The market has grown by
orders of magnitude, and new user interfaces have become widely used,
especially with social media apps. WordLand itself has been heavily
influenced by Facebook and Twitter, for example, even though blogging
predates both. So of course the <i>presentation</i> of the blog has
opportunities to evolve as well.
</p>
<p>
The bottom-line – if you already have a WordPress theme you’re happy
with, then stick with it, no need to use Baseline. But if you’re
starting a fresh site, using WordLand as your editor, and you value
simplicity, then I recommend trying it, and if you like it, keep using
it.
</p>
<p>
BTW, I have it installed on
<a href="https://daveverse.org/">daveverse.org</a>, and I’m a happy
camper. So we have one endorsement. It’s a good start. <span
class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

<p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/13/knickGameCard.png" style="float: right; border: 1px solid silver; margin-left: 10px;">This
is what it says on Google about tomorrow night’s Knicks game vs the
Celtics in Boston. I’ve pointed the red arrow at the part that makes me
think I must be dreaming. <i>NYK leads 3-1.</i> Yesterday at this time
(5:30PM Eastern) I was in a funk, sure that the Knicks were about to be
obliterated by the Celtics who had blown out the Knicks on Saturday, and
the beginning of last night’s game confirmed that suspicion. The Knicks
couldn’t seem to hit a shot, and the Celtics were hitting 3-pointers
over and over and over and over. My body chemistry shifted. I felt the
doom members of an ancient tribe of primitive humans must have felt as
we were losing a war for existence with a neighboring tribe. It’s
primitive, but it’s real. However! In the second half it turned around.
The Knicks came out with a purpose, unlike the previous two wins, this
one was not a squeaker at the end. The Knicks were masterful. They won
this game, not by luck or perseverence, rather simply by <i>being
better</i> than the Celtics. The reigning champion Celtics who must’ve
relaxed just enough to fuel the victory for the hometown boys. So we’re
up 3-1 now. The Celtics have to win the next three. If they lose one,
it’s over. No I didn’t think we’d be here tonight. Remember that when
you feel sure you know that something is going to turn out a certain
way. You just never know, it could come out a different way, as
unbelievable as that might be.</p>

<h1 id="2025-05-11-novigrad-rovinj-poreč">
2025-05-11 Novigrad, Rovinj, Poreč
</h1>
<p>
We’re spending a few days in Croatia. We took the plane to Zagreb, got a
rental car and drove west to Istria. Our first station is Novigrad. The
reputation for fabulous sunsets is well deserved.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-1.jpg" alt="a propeller on an airplane" />
</p>
<p>
First stop on the autobahn. Pistachio baklava and Apfelstrudel, coffe
and sparkling water.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-2.jpg" alt="Strudel, baklava, coffee and sparkling water" />
</p>
<p>
Many hours later we finally arrived. Claudia does all the driving. I’m
happy to see she’s still smiling.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-3.jpg" alt="Alex" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-4.jpg" alt="Claudia" />
</p>
<p>
In May, everything is still offseason. The sunset is wonderful.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-5.jpg" alt="Sunset" />
</p>
<p>
The next day, we take a walk around town. There are pools cut into the
stoneworks. But in May, I don’t feel like taking a bath. We saw a
handful of people swimming, however.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-6.jpg" alt="A flagstone waterfront with two small round pools cut out" />
</p>
<p>
We looked at the Lođa Belveder.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-7.jpg" alt="Alex sitting on a bench in a viewpoint" />
</p>
<p>
And then we found one of these colourful umbrella passages popular all
over the world. I mean, it’s nice to have colourful shade. I’m not sure
we need to use functional umbrellas for it.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-8.jpg" alt="A street with ropes up above, with caught up umbrellas casting a colourful shade" />
</p>
<p>
In the early afternoon we drove to Rovinj and jogged around. The houses
of the old town are built right to the water’s edge.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-9.jpg" alt="An old town with a tower" />
</p>
<p>
Because the picture above was taken against the sun, we decided to cross
the isthmus and take a picture with the sun in our back. It wasn’t much
better, though.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-10.jpg" alt="The same old town from another angle" />
</p>
<p>
We decided to get up onto the hill.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-11.jpg" alt="Alex on some easy stairs, in shorts and with a red t-shirt" />
</p>
<p>
On the way back we noticed little alleys going straight up or straight
down towards the water.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-12.jpg" alt="Alex on some very steep stairs" />
</p>
<p>
Nice old cobblestone roads.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-13.jpg" alt="Narrow alleys with cobblestone roads" />
</p>
<p>
On the way out, we found a tree with pink flowers. 😍
</p>
<p>
Gewöhnlicher Judasbaum<br> Cercis siliquastrum
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-14.jpg" alt="Pink flowers on a tree" />
</p>
<p>
We decided to drive back via Poreč. Again, we jogged through town. We
saw two towers with rooftops. This one seemed to be open.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-15.jpg" alt="Alex on a square with a three story round tower visible in the back" />
</p>
<p>
And it was open! We had something to drink.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-16.jpg" alt="Alex making a selfie" />
</p>
<p>
On the way back we decided to look at the outside of the city wall. And
it was full of flowers.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-17.jpg" alt="Old walls, old houses, pink flowers, nesting oidgeons" />
</p>
<p>
So beautiful! 😍
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-18.jpg" alt="Pink flowers growing out of the wall" />
</p>
<p>
So very beautiful! 😍
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-19.jpg" alt="More pink flowers growing out of the wall" />
</p>
<p>
You know I can’t help myself.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-20.jpg" alt="Blue flowers" />
</p>
<p>
We returned to Novigrad and had dinner by the sea.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-21.jpg" alt="Claudia sitting at a table" />
</p>
<p>
The sunset was, once again, beautiful.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-22.jpg" alt="Yellow flowers" />
</p>
<p>
That park at the corner has a bunch of trees with hundreds of starlings
coming home to sleep. They talk to each other and it’s the most
fascinating murmuring.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-23.jpg" alt="Alex listening to the starlings" />
</p>
<p>
When you watched closely, the round shadows in the lower part of the
tree were pine cones but at the top the round shadows moved around.
These were innumerable birds trying to find a place to sleep next to
each other. 😍
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-24.jpg" alt="Tree silhouette against the sunset" />
</p>
<p>
We sat under the trees but it was getting cold.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-25.jpg" alt="Tree silhouette and Alex sitting on the wall against the sunset" />
</p>
<p>
This walk was beautiful.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-26.jpg" alt="The marina area again with the pools, late in the evening" />
</p>
<p>
The sunset was, again, fantastic.

2025-05-12 Novigrad – Dajla
</h1>
<p>
Today was a no-car day. Yay! We got up, had breakfast, went for a walk,
came back, and went for a slow 16km jog along the coast, with a stop for
water and palačinke (crêpes). So nice!

A jasmine closeup. Or so I thought. The smell was so strong. But then
again, it didn’t quite look like the jasmin I saw in Thailand. And Flora
Incognita says:

the app says:

The trail took us through camping grounds and endless holiday bungalow
settlements, most of them empty. If you ever come here, don’t come
between June and September because the infrastructure here is built of a
gazillion tourists. May is great, I’d say. But we’ve been very lucky
with the weather.

<h2 id="how-to-make-a-link-aggregator-in-obsidian">How to make a Link
Aggregator in Obsidian</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-12, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
I’m finishing up my move from Notion to Obsidian and one complexity I
encountered was all my saved links. In the almost seven years of using
Notion, I amassed a ~1.2 GB database of links. This is because of how
the Notion Web Clipper creates a backup of the article and its assets.
While this is gold to an internet archivist… I really only use this
feature to sneak around paywalls. Moving to Obsidian gave me a chance to
rethink my link collection process and along the way I figured out how
to make an automated Link Aggregator that I could parlay into a
newsletter-like blog post.
</p>
<h2>
Step 1: Install Obsidian Web Clipper
</h2>
<p>
The first step was to capture links. I had looked at
<a href="https://medium.com/@_jonas/quick-bookmarks-clippings-in-obsidian-3050d375697a">creating
a custom bookmarklet</a>, but as I rolled this out across my iPad,
iPhone, personal computer, and work computer, the foundation wasn’t
sturdy. If I made a change in how I wanted it to work, I’d have to
manually edit half-a-dozen JavaScript bookmarklets. The path of least
resistance was to embrace Obsidian Web Clipper, the community standard
browser extension for this sort of task instead that is available in all
browsers.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/obsidian-web-clipper-add-item-popup.jpg" alt="The Obsidian Add Item Popup window with fields like title, tags, description, and published date" />
</p>
<p>
Obsidian Web Clipper actually solves a long-standing issue I had with
Notion Web Clipper, I couldn’t add tags in the “Add Item” workflow, you
had to bounce out to the app and manage it there. Obsidian Web Clipper
let’s you add tags right there in the “Add Item” window. But it’s not
all roses because Obsidian will <em>always</em> bounce you out to the
application for saving. Weirdly –because it’s the same as what I didn’t
like about Notion– I don’t mind this in Obsidian because it gives me a
chance to review the content I’m digitally hoarding.
</p>
<p>
Obsidian Web Clipper will also scrape the text, which is handy for
retrieval later, but critically it doesn’t save images and hotlinks to
the production assets. This might upset archivists, but as someone who
doesn’t want a 1.2 GB link database again, I welcome it.
</p>
<p>
I know AI is a controversial topic, but this is one place I would
welcome an LLM to summarize articles and provide some bullet points for
reference later. Perhaps a short list of other publications that have
referenced this article as well? I’m spit-balling, but I don’t need
scraped text, what I need is something to jog my memory.
</p>
<p>
If I had more time, I’d grab some quotes I found interesting and
<a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/">do like Jim does</a> and add my
own thoughts and notes as a response. Are “reaction blogs” a thing? I
guess they are.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/obsidian-web-clipper-settings.jpg" alt="The Obsidian Web Clipper Settings page where you customize the fields you want to see for your link template" />
</p>
<p>
The one change I make to the Default template is to remove some fields
and set my default Note Location folder to “Inputs/Links”. This is
unique to how I have my vault organized (more on that later), but links
are easy to accumulate and I find having a dedicated bucket for them
will save you cognitive load later.
</p>
<h2>
Step 2: Write a brief summary
</h2>
<p>
My link aggregation process has one mandatory process step: Write a
brief summary. A short tweet-length description of why I found this link
interesting or useful. This is akin to the “WHY?” column in a database
that we’ve been discussing on Shop Talk this year. Why was this link
cool enough to collect? Why did I find it interesting? What were my
thoughts?
</p>
<p>
Actual human thoughts are becoming a valuable commodity these days.
</p>
<p>
In Obsidian Web Clipper there’s a <code>description</code> field that by
default grabs the document description meta tag. This is not useful most
of the time, but can give you some text to shape if you’re in a hurry.
</p>
<h2>
Step 3: Generate a DataView
</h2>
<p>
The last step is to create a New Note called “Link Aggregator” to
generate a list of links I can copy over to a Markdown file in my blog.
To do that I use the
<a href="https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/">Dataview</a>
plugin, which allows you to use an SQL-like query language to generate a
<code>LIST</code> or <code>TABLE</code> of content based on your query.
</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>```dataview
LIST WITHOUT ID elink(file.frontmatter.source, file.name)+
                ": "+file.frontmatter.description
FROM "Inputs/Links"
WHERE file.ctime &gt;= date(today) - dur(1 week)
SORT file.name ASC
```
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
There’s a lot to Dataview, but this query will generate a list of
external links from my Links folder that I added within the last week.
Now I can slurp up those links and put them in a blog post or
newsletter.
</p>
<p>
Process-wise, I have to copy the Dataview-generated list into a New Note
in Obsidian because copying the text from the Link Aggregator page to my
blog pastes the Dataview query. Creating a dummy Note isn’t ideal but at
least I have a workaround. I’m sure I’m one plugin away from being able
to export markdown from a Dataview query.
</p>
<h2>
Happy Aggregating!
</h2>
<p>
Like other ideas in my life, I’ve tried to make this as low-effort as
possible or else I won’t do it. I think I have a system in place that
allows me to do what I was already doing (collect links), but a more
efficient and effective way to do something I want to do more (share
links). If this is useful, feel free to steal this idea and make your
own aggregator.
</p>
<p>
The Web is a network of content, let’s build the network. Blogs linking
to other blogs are the best blogs, let’s not lose that part of blogging.
We are in algorithmic content bubbles looking at different Internets,
let’s pop those bubbles by sharing what we find in our Internet
journeys.

enjoyed the stories. I knew the series was about to end as we approached
the end of the final episode, and thought things were about to wind
down, and then it took a little turn, no spoilers, that maybe was the
best ending for any series ever. Originally I thought that honor went to

re-watched it and realized it was junk? That happened with

<p>So far Gemini has done the best job of emulating my coding style.
Here’s an <a href="https://g.co/gemini/share/96dad470052e">example</a>.
I didn’t have to instruct it in how to do it, it figured it out.
Impressive. I’ve spent a lot of time trying and failing to get Claude
and ChatGPT to work the way I work. It makes a big difference, because
if I want to try out something they’ve offered, I have to spend time
doing grunt work to get it so I can read it and understand what they’re
doing.</p>

I once owned a few acres of land that had some old trees on it. I sat
under one of the trees on a lovely afternoon, and thought of the tree “I
own you.” The tree formed a thought that somehow I could tune into. “I
was here long before you were born and I will be here long after you
die.” I didn’t see it exactly as a response to my claim of ownership.
But it sure did put things in perspective!
