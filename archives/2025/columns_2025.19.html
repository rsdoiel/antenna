<p>date: 2025-05-14, from: Enlightenment Economics blog</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been letting these posts about my reading slip recently, for
reasons of general busy-ness. The last thing I want to do of an evening
or lunchbreak is more sitting at my screen, especially in such lovely
sunny weather. Still, ‚Ä¶

<h2 id="about-the-baseline-theme">About the Baseline theme</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-14, from: Dave Winer‚Äôs Scripting News</p>
<p>
Scott Hanson has been working on the
<a href="https://wordland.shanson.de/2025/05/13/how-to-install-baseline/">Baseline
theme</a> and it‚Äôs ready for people to try out.
</p>
<p>
An important caveat. This theme was designed to be the beginning theme
for WordLand-authored WordPress sites.
</p>
<p>
The goal is to get the minimal features for a nice blog-oriented site
running in WordPress.
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs open source, so you can start with Baseline and add all the
features you want.
</p>
<p>
And Scott has said he‚Äôd be happy to work with others to make it so that
it would be great for presenting non-WordLand-authored writing.
</p>
<p>
As the developer of <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>, I
wanted to go back to the beginning and take fresh a approach to the way
blogs implement various features in 2025. It‚Äôs been a long time since we
took a fresh look, and lots has happened since. The market has grown by
orders of magnitude, and new user interfaces have become widely used,
especially with social media apps. WordLand itself has been heavily
influenced by Facebook and Twitter, for example, even though blogging
predates both. So of course the <i>presentation</i> of the blog has
opportunities to evolve as well.
</p>
<p>
The bottom-line ‚Äì if you already have a WordPress theme you‚Äôre happy
with, then stick with it, no need to use Baseline. But if you‚Äôre
starting a fresh site, using WordLand as your editor, and you value
simplicity, then I recommend trying it, and if you like it, keep using
it.
</p>
<p>
BTW, I have it installed on
<a href="https://daveverse.org/">daveverse.org</a>, and I‚Äôm a happy
camper. So we have one endorsement. It‚Äôs a good start. <span

2025-05-13 Opatija, Crikvenica
</h1>
<p>
We stopped in Opatija. The settlement along a lake along a steep hill
reminded me of Lausanne or Neufch√¢tel in Switzerland. There were hollow
ruins as well as fancy new Grand Hotels, some with an ancient Viennese
flair. To me, that‚Äôs weird. To chase the colonised past for tourism
cash? ü´§ Didn‚Äôt the Austrians use Croatian troops to out down Italian
revolts and the like? Well, after the Austro-Hungarian empire fell
apart, the Italians took over Opatija but then the communists pushed
them ought.
</p>
<p>
Visiting former Yugoslavia is dreadful from a history perspective
because when I was a teenager the civil war and the breakup of the
country was always there, in the back of my mind. Watching
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warriors_(1999_TV_series)">Warriors</a>
many years later was the worst, though.
</p>
<p>
Hearing so many Austrians on the streets is weird.

though.

<p><img src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/13/knickGameCard.png" style="float: right; border: 1px solid silver; margin-left: 10px;">This
is what it says on Google about tomorrow night‚Äôs Knicks game vs the
Celtics in Boston. I‚Äôve pointed the red arrow at the part that makes me
think I must be dreaming. <i>NYK leads 3-1.</i> Yesterday at this time
(5:30PM Eastern) I was in a funk, sure that the Knicks were about to be
obliterated by the Celtics who had blown out the Knicks on Saturday, and
the beginning of last night‚Äôs game confirmed that suspicion. The Knicks
couldn‚Äôt seem to hit a shot, and the Celtics were hitting 3-pointers
over and over and over and over. My body chemistry shifted. I felt the
doom members of an ancient tribe of primitive humans must have felt as
we were losing a war for existence with a neighboring tribe. It‚Äôs
primitive, but it‚Äôs real. However! In the second half it turned around.
The Knicks came out with a purpose, unlike the previous two wins, this
one was not a squeaker at the end. The Knicks were masterful. They won
this game, not by luck or perseverence, rather simply by <i>being
better</i> than the Celtics. The reigning champion Celtics who must‚Äôve
relaxed just enough to fuel the victory for the hometown boys. So we‚Äôre
up 3-1 now. The Celtics have to win the next three. If they lose one,
it‚Äôs over. No I didn‚Äôt think we‚Äôd be here tonight. Remember that when
you feel sure you know that something is going to turn out a certain
way. You just never know, it could come out a different way, as
unbelievable as that might be.</p>

2025-05-11 Novigrad, Rovinj, Poreƒç
</h1>
<p>
We‚Äôre spending a few days in Croatia. We took the plane to Zagreb, got a
rental car and drove west to Istria. Our first station is Novigrad. The
reputation for fabulous sunsets is well deserved.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-1.jpg" alt="a propeller on an airplane" />
</p>
<p>
First stop on the autobahn. Pistachio baklava and Apfelstrudel, coffe
and sparkling water.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-2.jpg" alt="Strudel, baklava, coffee and sparkling water" />
</p>
<p>
Many hours later we finally arrived. Claudia does all the driving. I‚Äôm
happy to see she‚Äôs still smiling.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
In May, everything is still offseason. The sunset is wonderful.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-5.jpg" alt="Sunset" />
</p>
<p>
The next day, we take a walk around town. There are pools cut into the
stoneworks. But in May, I don‚Äôt feel like taking a bath. We saw a
handful of people swimming, however.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-6.jpg" alt="A flagstone waterfront with two small round pools cut out" />
</p>
<p>
We looked at the Loƒëa Belveder.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-7.jpg" alt="Alex sitting on a bench in a viewpoint" />
</p>
<p>
And then we found one of these colourful umbrella passages popular all
over the world. I mean, it‚Äôs nice to have colourful shade. I‚Äôm not sure
we need to use functional umbrellas for it.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-8.jpg" alt="A street with ropes up above, with caught up umbrellas casting a colourful shade" />
</p>
<p>
In the early afternoon we drove to Rovinj and jogged around. The houses
of the old town are built right to the water‚Äôs edge.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-9.jpg" alt="An old town with a tower" />
</p>
<p>
Because the picture above was taken against the sun, we decided to cross
the isthmus and take a picture with the sun in our back. It wasn‚Äôt much
better, though.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-11-novigrad-10.jpg" alt="The same old town from another angle" />

<p>
We decided to get up onto the hill.

On the way back we noticed little alleys going straight up or straight
down towards the water.

saw two towers with rooftops. This one seemed to be open.

That park at the corner has a bunch of trees with hundreds of starlings
coming home to sleep. They talk to each other and it‚Äôs the most
fascinating murmuring.
</p>

tree were pine cones but at the top the round shadows moved around.
These were innumerable birds trying to find a place to sleep next to
each other. üòç

Today was a no-car day. Yay! We got up, had breakfast, went for a walk,
came back, and went for a slow 16km jog along the coast, with a stop for
water and palaƒçinke (cr√™pes). So nice!

The trail took us through camping grounds and endless holiday bungalow

<h2 id="how-to-make-a-link-aggregator-in-obsidian">How to make a Link
Aggregator in Obsidian</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-12, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
I‚Äôm finishing up my move from Notion to Obsidian and one complexity I
encountered was all my saved links. In the almost seven years of using
Notion, I amassed a ~1.2 GB database of links. This is because of how
the Notion Web Clipper creates a backup of the article and its assets.
While this is gold to an internet archivist‚Ä¶ I really only use this
feature to sneak around paywalls. Moving to Obsidian gave me a chance to
rethink my link collection process and along the way I figured out how
to make an automated Link Aggregator that I could parlay into a
newsletter-like blog post.
</p>
<h2>
Step 1: Install Obsidian Web Clipper
</h2>
<p>
The first step was to capture links. I had looked at
<a href="https://medium.com/@_jonas/quick-bookmarks-clippings-in-obsidian-3050d375697a">creating
a custom bookmarklet</a>, but as I rolled this out across my iPad,
iPhone, personal computer, and work computer, the foundation wasn‚Äôt
sturdy. If I made a change in how I wanted it to work, I‚Äôd have to
manually edit half-a-dozen JavaScript bookmarklets. The path of least
resistance was to embrace Obsidian Web Clipper, the community standard
browser extension for this sort of task instead that is available in all
browsers.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/obsidian-web-clipper-add-item-popup.jpg" alt="The Obsidian Add Item Popup window with fields like title, tags, description, and published date" />
</p>
<p>
Obsidian Web Clipper actually solves a long-standing issue I had with
Notion Web Clipper, I couldn‚Äôt add tags in the ‚ÄúAdd Item‚Äù workflow, you
had to bounce out to the app and manage it there. Obsidian Web Clipper
let‚Äôs you add tags right there in the ‚ÄúAdd Item‚Äù window. But it‚Äôs not
all roses because Obsidian will <em>always</em> bounce you out to the
application for saving. Weirdly ‚Äìbecause it‚Äôs the same as what I didn‚Äôt
like about Notion‚Äì I don‚Äôt mind this in Obsidian because it gives me a
chance to review the content I‚Äôm digitally hoarding.
</p>
<p>
Obsidian Web Clipper will also scrape the text, which is handy for
retrieval later, but critically it doesn‚Äôt save images and hotlinks to
the production assets. This might upset archivists, but as someone who
doesn‚Äôt want a 1.2 GB link database again, I welcome it.
</p>
<p>
I know AI is a controversial topic, but this is one place I would
welcome an LLM to summarize articles and provide some bullet points for
reference later. Perhaps a short list of other publications that have
referenced this article as well? I‚Äôm spit-balling, but I don‚Äôt need
scraped text, what I need is something to jog my memory.
</p>
<p>
If I had more time, I‚Äôd grab some quotes I found interesting and
<a href="https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/">do like Jim does</a> and add my
own thoughts and notes as a response. Are ‚Äúreaction blogs‚Äù a thing? I
guess they are.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/obsidian-web-clipper-settings.jpg" alt="The Obsidian Web Clipper Settings page where you customize the fields you want to see for your link template" />
</p>
<p>
The one change I make to the Default template is to remove some fields
and set my default Note Location folder to ‚ÄúInputs/Links‚Äù. This is
unique to how I have my vault organized (more on that later), but links
are easy to accumulate and I find having a dedicated bucket for them
will save you cognitive load later.
</p>
<h2>
Step 2: Write a brief summary
</h2>
<p>
My link aggregation process has one mandatory process step: Write a
brief summary. A short tweet-length description of why I found this link
interesting or useful. This is akin to the ‚ÄúWHY?‚Äù column in a database
that we‚Äôve been discussing on Shop Talk this year. Why was this link
cool enough to collect? Why did I find it interesting? What were my
thoughts?
</p>
<p>
Actual human thoughts are becoming a valuable commodity these days.
</p>
<p>
In Obsidian Web Clipper there‚Äôs a <code>description</code> field that by
default grabs the document description meta tag. This is not useful most
of the time, but can give you some text to shape if you‚Äôre in a hurry.
</p>
<h2>
Step 3: Generate a DataView
</h2>
<p>
The last step is to create a New Note called ‚ÄúLink Aggregator‚Äù to
generate a list of links I can copy over to a Markdown file in my blog.
To do that I use the
<a href="https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/">Dataview</a>
plugin, which allows you to use an SQL-like query language to generate a
<code>LIST</code> or <code>TABLE</code> of content based on your query.
</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>```dataview
LIST WITHOUT ID elink(file.frontmatter.source, file.name)+
                ": "+file.frontmatter.description
FROM "Inputs/Links"
WHERE file.ctime &gt;= date(today) - dur(1 week)
SORT file.name ASC
```
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
There‚Äôs a lot to Dataview, but this query will generate a list of
external links from my Links folder that I added within the last week.
Now I can slurp up those links and put them in a blog post or
newsletter.
</p>
<p>
Process-wise, I have to copy the Dataview-generated list into a New Note
in Obsidian because copying the text from the Link Aggregator page to my
blog pastes the Dataview query. Creating a dummy Note isn‚Äôt ideal but at
least I have a workaround. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm one plugin away from being able
to export markdown from a Dataview query.
</p>
<h2>
Happy Aggregating!
</h2>
<p>
Like other ideas in my life, I‚Äôve tried to make this as low-effort as
possible or else I won‚Äôt do it. I think I have a system in place that
allows me to do what I was already doing (collect links), but a more
efficient and effective way to do something I want to do more (share
links). If this is useful, feel free to steal this idea and make your
own aggregator.
</p>
<p>
The Web is a network of content, let‚Äôs build the network. Blogs linking
to other blogs are the best blogs, let‚Äôs not lose that part of blogging.
We are in algorithmic content bubbles looking at different Internets,
let‚Äôs pop those bubbles by sharing what we find in our Internet
journeys.

enjoyed the stories. I knew the series was about to end as we approached
the end of the final episode, and thought things were about to wind
down, and then it took a little turn, no spoilers, that maybe was the
best ending for any series ever. Originally I thought that honor went to

re-watched it and realized it was junk? That happened with

<p>So far Gemini has done the best job of emulating my coding style.
Here‚Äôs an <a href="https://g.co/gemini/share/96dad470052e">example</a>.
I didn‚Äôt have to instruct it in how to do it, it figured it out.
Impressive. I‚Äôve spent a lot of time trying and failing to get Claude
and ChatGPT to work the way I work. It makes a big difference, because
if I want to try out something they‚Äôve offered, I have to spend time
doing grunt work to get it so I can read it and understand what they‚Äôre
doing.</p>

I once owned a few acres of land that had some old trees on it. I sat
under one of the trees on a lovely afternoon, and thought of the tree ‚ÄúI
own you.‚Äù The tree formed a thought that somehow I could tune into. ‚ÄúI
was here long before you were born and I will be here long after you
die.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt see it exactly as a response to my claim of ownership.
But it sure did put things in perspective!
