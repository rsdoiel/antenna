## 2025-05-01 Running the Alps

date: 2025-05-04, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-05-01-running-the-alps">2025-05-01 Running the Alps</h1>

<p>That is, running the Alps with a heart for plants! We arrived in the Vallais today and as soon as we had emptied our luggage we decided to go for a jogging-hike to the Cave du Sex (yeah, that‚Äôs the name! Or Cave du Scex. üòÖ) and we took some pictures on the way.</p>

<p>Buchsbl√§ttriges Kreuzbl√ºmchen<br>
Polygaloides chamaebuxus</p>

<p>The ascent was soon too steep to run but beautiful as the sun began to set.</p>

<p>We are on the southern flanks of the mountains, so the mountains to the south are still lying in the sun while our side is being engulfed in shadows.</p>

<p>From the Cave du Sex we were running along the Bisse du Tsittoret towards Colombire.
This an old waterway along the mountainside to transport water from one alp to the next.
It has been restored for the tourists and it&rsquo;s super nice.
Pretty nice for running, since it follows the gentle slope along the waster.</p>

<p>The bisse was beautiful. So nice to be hiking along a murmuring water. And always slightly downhill.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-01-run-the-alps-21.jpg" alt="2025-05-01-run-the-alps-21.jpg" /></p>

<p>The communities invested in nice wooden benches. I like it!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-01-run-the-alps-22.jpg" alt="2025-05-01-run-the-alps-22.jpg" /></p>

<p>The bisse empties into a wild mountain river. A few meters downhill there&rsquo;s a new beginning but the sluice gate was closed. As it turns out, the bisse got replenished quickly from new rivulets joining from the mountain.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-01-run-the-alps-23.jpg" alt="2025-05-01-run-the-alps-23.jpg" /></p>

<p>This is La Sign√®se, according to Open Street Map (OSM). I also saw it called Bover√®che. OSM claims that&rsquo;s the name of the road. Oh well. There&rsquo;s a nice view point, there.</p>

<p>Plant identification mostly done by Flora Incognita (<a class="account" href="https://wisskomm.social/@FloraIncognita_DE" title="@FloraIncognita_DE@wisskomm.social">@FloraIncognita_DE</a>) but for the mushroom I fell back to Seek by iNaturalist. What I love about Flora Incognita is that I can follow links to all sorts of reference works, including Wikipedia. Seek, on the other, has nothing. No longer explanation, no link to Wikipedia. Truly, a lost opportunity.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-05-04, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

If you get the <a href="https://subscribe.scripting.com/">nightly email</a>, the text might be a bit more readable. I've increased the font-size from 17px to 18px. I've only been able to do this lately because I could tap into what ChatGPT knew about it, whereas before I was flying blind, with no idea of the unusual things that happen when HTML is sent via email. There is another option, click on the date at the top of each email and that will open the same stuff in the web. It can be easier to make the text larger there than it is in an email client.

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/10/10/ronaldMcGrimace.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">ChatGPT is great for finding information on the public web, but I can't figure out how to find stuff I've worked on with ChatGPT in ChatGPT. There are big usability issues. I think it's getting better in some ways, but it's leaving me more scattered and disorganized than I was before when I took notes outside of ChatGPT. There's another problem, if I want to use my own editing and organizing tools, then the author of the software has to pay the vendor of the LLM for my users using it. That cuts me out, because I don't charge people to use my software, at least not so far, and I have no interest in being a reseller of LLM services. Same problem with Amazon and storage, why won't they sell storage to the user that they can allocate for use with my app, and others. That would give us the kind of power we used to have on the desktop where multiple apps could work on the same file at different times. If I want to make something that stores stuff in the cloud, I have to buy it and resell it. I have tried to discuss this with product runners at companies that could offer this service, it would fit in with what they did. There must be a legal reason here, ie who's responsible for the content being stored.

## 2025-04-27 Structural navigation

date: 2025-05-03, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-04-27-structural-navigation">2025-04-27 Structural navigation</h1>

<p>Sometimes my mind goes back to text editing and text editors. I have a love/hate relationship with ed(1). I kind of like the deliberate mindset I need to bring. But I also don‚Äôt like to think in terms of lines. Maybe if each sentence is a line, that‚Äôs better. But I often think about better semantic addressing.</p>

<p>Example: <code>p</code> prints a range of line(s) is the standard. What I would also like is &ldquo;print a range of paragraph&rdquo;, &ldquo;print a range of sentences&rdquo;, &ldquo;print a range of words&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s a hierarchy, here. So once there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;current&rdquo; paragraph, you can list its sentences or its words. My hope is that this is more useful than working on lines.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm still struggling to invent a command language, however. ‚ÄúPrint paragraph. Next. Next. Number sentences. Third sentence. Replace this with that. Print paragraph.‚Äù I think this how I would work? ‚ÄúLast paragraph. Insert paragraph. Start typing.‚Äù Would that be <code>p p n 3s /this/that/ p</code> and <code>par $ i ‚Ä¶</code> Effectively, <code>p</code> switches to paragraphs and prints them, and moves to the next one if used without a range. <code>n</code> numbers the items one level down. In this case, with a paragraph selected, <code>n</code> numbers the sentences. <code>s</code> switches to sentences and prints them. I&rsquo;m not sure about the search &amp; replace command. Is that also <code>s</code>?</p>

<p>Should the data be kept in a tree? Should reading the text involve a real parser that delivers a sort of abstract syntax tree and names the nodes which automatically turn into commands?</p>

<p>And then: should this be written in Perl? üòç</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://mastodon.acm.org/@mxp" title="@mxp@mastodon.acm.org">@mxp</a> said he had written ¬´an Emacs interface to a syntactic parser¬ª, but I&rsquo;m not sure this is what I&rsquo;m looking for. A natural language parser (NLP) is maybe not what I&rsquo;m looking for. I suspect it would help avoid grammar mistakes, which makes sense to me. But is it what need as I write?</p>

<p>He then pointed me at Engelbart&rsquo;s <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/1476589.1476645">A research center for augmenting human intellect</a>. There, we find <a href="https://communitywiki.org/wiki/PurpleNumbers">purple numbers</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The principal manifestation of this hierarchical structure is the breaking up of text into arbitrary segments called &ldquo;statements,&rdquo; each of which bears a number showing its serial location in the text and its &ldquo;level&rdquo; in an &ldquo;outline&rdquo; of the text.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about the use of an outline. Many people seem to like outlines, but for me an outline as a writing tool is weird. I never start with an outline, except for cases where I know I need to follow a structure and even then the structure is usually trivial: Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, References, or something along these lines. A bunch of headings is all I need. Do I need an outline view? I agree that showing all the headings is important to navigate any non-trivial text document when you&rsquo;re reading and working with it. But if I focus on writing, the outline doesn&rsquo;t seem too important. It&rsquo;s too far &ldquo;up&rdquo; in the structure, for me.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://mastodon.acm.org/@CerstinMahlow" title="@CerstinMahlow@mastodon.acm.org">@CerstinMahlow</a> wrote a position paper: <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2303.17894">Writing Tools: Looking Back to Look Ahead</a> where she argues that ¬´new writing tools should be inspired by &ldquo;failed&rdquo; projects from the 1970s and 1980s¬ª and discusses the current state of affairs:</p>

<p>One type of functionality that Mahlow and Piotrowski suggest are information functions that use NLP techniques to highlight certain aspects of the evolving text, commonly referred to as ‚Äúsyntax highlighting.‚Äù Since 2013, iA Writer has offered such a feature in a commercial product to specifically highlight nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc., advertising it as ‚Äúusing parts of speech to improve your writing‚Äù and explicitly stating that writers deserve the same professional support as programmers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This goes in a different direction, &ldquo;down&rdquo; to the grammar roles of words. Nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs. The problem is that when I write, I hardly ever worry about a particular verb. I never want to navigate to the accusative object of this sentence or focus on the subject. This is a very detailed view that I don&rsquo;t care about.</p>

<p>The question is: What do I care about? Moving sentences around. Starting sentences between some other sentences and then realizing that I started at the wrong place and moving that fragments around. I think what I need is a prototype editor that I can start using and where I can easily add and remove functionality. And I&rsquo;m not sure that Emacs is the correct environment because there is so damn much to distract me.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Editors">#Editors</a></p>

<p><strong>2025-05-03</strong>. I wrote a little Perl script called <code>scr</code> that opens a bunch of files and allows me to navigate using p for paragraph, s for sentence and w for word. Typing the letter with an optional range:</p>

<ul>
<li>p prints the current paragraph, one sentence per line</li>
<li>s prints the current sentence</li>
<li>w prints the current word</li>
</ul>

<p>Use an address prefix like ed:</p>

<ul>
<li>a number prints the element with that number (currently zero indexed because I was lazy)</li>
<li>$ prints the last element (the first one is 0 but the last one requires counting)</li>
<li>plus and a number or minus and a number prints the element relative the current one (so +1p prints the next paragraph)</li>
</ul>

<p>Use address prefixes like ed:</p>

<ul>
<li>two such numbers separated by a comma prints the range (so 0,2s prints the first three sentences)</li>
<li>if you use a comma but just one number the other number is replaced by the current address (so ,+2w prints the current word and the next two)</li>
<li>if you use just the comma, this prints all the elements (so ,p is the same as 0,$p and prints the whole file)</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently whitespace is not significant:</p>

<ul>
<li>multiple whitespace characters collapse</li>
<li>leading and trailing whitespace disappears</li>
</ul>

<p>Example, based on <a href="Warfare">Warfare</a>:</p>

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap">
alex@subterraneobombus ~> scr Documents/Homepage/Warfare.md
Read Documents/Homepage/Warfare.md

<u>0 :</u> p
# Warfare

<u>0 0:</u> 1p
Im Telepolis Artikel _Der Krieg wird zum Terroranschlag_ [¬π](http://www.heise.de/tp/deutsch/special/irak/15069/1.html) steht, was mich auch schon im Fall von [Israel](Israel) graust: Auf blossen Verdacht hin werden Leute erschossen.
Kein Gericht.
Keine Verteidigung.
Ein Geheimdiensturteil, und schon wird ein Auto beschossen, um irgendeinen Anf√ºhrer zu t√∂ten.
Dabei sterben Leibw√§chtern, Unbeteiligte, und wohlm√∂glich noch eine Frau oder ein Kind.
Sowas kennt man aus Israel.
Im Iraq ist man nun eine Stufe weiter.
Man bombardiert Luxuslimousinen (die sicher irgendeinem Schuft geh√∂ren ‚Äì aber haben er und _alle_ Insassen wirklich die Todesstrafe verdient?
Geh√∂rt die nicht vielmehr abgeschafft?) ‚Äì und nachher ist nicht mal klar, wenn man √ºberhaupt _versucht_ hat zu t√∂ten.
Unfassbar.

<u>0 1:</u> 2s
Keine Verteidigung.

<u>0 1 2:</u> 0w
Keine

<u>0 1 2 0:</u> q
</pre>

<p>The prompt current prints file number, paragraph number, sentence number, word number.</p>

<p>The example also shows problems handling parentheticals (or quote).</p>

<p>I think before I can move on to insert or append operations, I need to further investigate navigation and selection. I&rsquo;d like to remember context, so 1p p should print paragraph number one and then the next one without me having to type +1p. Perhaps we can use a period for the current one. So .p prints the current paragraph again.</p>

<p>I also think that a paragraph print should forget the sentence and word position. That currently doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons">Detroit Psssstons</a> were truly great in the first round of the playoffs. And I was really gratified, ecstatic even, to see the Timberwolves give the Lakers a complete <a href="https://www.npr.org/2010/11/04/131075640/how-shellacking-came-to-mean-defeat">shellacking</a>. I am so fed up with LeBron James. I can't imagine another team would want him. I can't imagine why he wants to win <i>another</i> freaking title. And I was really pissed off when people started saying they were contenders this year. Bull. Shit. And the reason I'm glad it was the Timberwolves is because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Randle">Julius Randle</a> is on that team now, and I hear he gets a fair amount of credit for their victory. The Knicks traded him for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns">KAT</a> last summer. They're a solid team. And while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_DiVincenzo">Donte DiVincenzo</a> isn't playing very well, we really need him back in NY, so maybe the Knicks can figure out a deal that makes sense. And why aren't the Knicks playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precious_Achiuwa">Precious Achiuwa</a>. He did great last year when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OG_Anunoby">OG</a> was injured. The Knicks have a good bench imho, they just don't get to play enough to be warmed up properly. So sad the way <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_McBride">Doooooce</a> performed in the Detroit series. Anyway it was exhausting. I would have been okay with the DP's winning, seriously -- I'm ready for baseball. And I don't imagine the next series, with the Celtics will be any kind of a walk in the park.

## On becoming living history

date: 2025-05-03, from: Liam on Linux

<p>It is one of the oddest things in computing that stuff to me, as a  big kid of heading for 60 years old but who still feels quite young and  enjoys learning and exploring, that the early history of Linux &ndash; a  development that came along mid-career for me &ndash; and indeed Unix, which  was taking shape when I was a child, is mysterious lost ancient history  now to those working in the field.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s not that long ago. It&rsquo;s well within living memory for lots of us <em>who are still working with it in full time employment.</em> Want to know why this command has that weird switch? Then go look up who wrote it and <em>ask him</em>. (And sadly yes there&rsquo;s a good chance it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;him&rdquo;.)</p> <p>Want to know why Windows command switches are one symbol and Unix  ones another? Go look at the OSes the guys who wrote them ran before.  They are a 2min Google away and emulators are FOSS. Just try them and  you can see what they learned from.</p> <p>This stuff isn&rsquo;t hieroglyphics. It&rsquo;s not carved on the walls of tombs deep underground.</p> <p>The reason that we have Snap and Flatpak and AppImage and macOS <code>.app</code> is all stuff that happened since I started my first job. I was there. So were thousands of others. I watched it take shape.</p> <p>But now, I write about how and why and I get shouted at by people who weren&rsquo;t even born yet. It&rsquo;s very odd.</p> <p>To me it looks like a lot of people spend thousands of  developer-hours flailing away trying to rewrite stuff that I deployed in  production in my 30s and they have no idea how it&rsquo;s supposed to work or  what they&rsquo;re trying to do. They&rsquo;re failing to copy a bad copy of a poor  imitation.</p> <p>Want to know how KDE 6 should have been? Run Windows 95 in VirtualBox  and see how the original worked! But no, instead, the team flops and  flails adding 86 more wheels to a bicycle and then they wonder why  people choose a poor-quality knock-off of a 2007 iPhone designed by  people who don&rsquo;t know why the iPhone works like that.</p> I am, for clarity, talking about GNOME &gt;3. And the iPhone runs a  cut down version of Mac OS X Tiger&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dashboard&rdquo; as its main UI.&nbsp;<br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=95105" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments

## Privacy for Agentic AI

date: 2025-05-02, updated: 2025-05-02, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Sooner or later, it&#8217;s going to happen. AI systems will start acting as agents, doing things on our behalf with some degree of autonomy. I think it&#8217;s worth thinking about the security of that now, while its still a nascent idea.</p>
<p>In 2019, I <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2020/02/inrupt_tim_bern.html">joined</a> Inrupt, a company that is commercializing Tim Berners-Lee&#8217;s open protocol for distributed data ownership. We are working on a <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2024/07/data-wallets-using-the-solid-protocol.html">digital wallet</a> that can make use of AI in this way. (We used to call it an &#8220;active wallet.&#8221; Now we&#8217;re calling it an &#8220;agentic wallet.&#8221;)</p>

## NCSC Guidance on ‚ÄúAdvanced Cryptography‚Äù

date: 2025-05-02, updated: 2025-05-01, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>The UK&#8217;s National Cyber Security Centre just released its <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/whitepaper/advanced-cryptography">white paper</a> on &#8220;Advanced Cryptography,&#8221; which it defines as &#8220;cryptographic techniques for processing encrypted data, providing enhanced functionality over and above that provided by traditional cryptography.&#8221; It includes things like homomorphic encryption, attribute-based encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, and secure multiparty computation.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s full of good advice. I especially appreciate this warning:</p>
<blockquote><p>When deciding whether to use Advanced Cryptography, start with a clear articulation of the problem, and use that to guide the development of an appropriate solution. That is, you should not start with an Advanced Cryptography technique, and then attempt to fit the functionality it provides to the problem. ...</p></blockquote>

But the last time when I synced  the TRG was in 2/2016 and then I have been using the original Palm III devices (IIIx + IIIxe) instead of the TRG. I have not wanted to damage  or lost my only TRG Pro (which is pretty rare as you  may know). Now I have two TRGs so  I can use one of them on daily basis, I think.

## Standing desk attempt

date: 2025-05-02, from: Jirka's blog

I'm trying to set  up a standing desk in my office. I  found a (less or more) space, two  older LCDs (the ViewSonic vp171s),  then prepared the keyboard and mouse.

## Standing desk (5)

date: 2025-05-02, from: Jirka's blog

I tried  to add a  Raspberry Pi model  B. It seems  to work (I  have to figure  how to  set  up the  EDUROAM  WiFi on  the  Raspbian) and  it's relatively slow. I need network connection  here only for some tasks so slow connection and even slower WWW browser may be OK. I should test it LaTeX works (I think that I even didn't tried to install it).

## Standing desk (4)

date: 2025-05-02, from: Jirka's blog

I tried  to use second  LCD (also VP171s but  a newer one)  and another DVI-HDMI adapter (this one I have used at home for years). The image is still terribly green and on the second LCD it is also unstable.

## Standing desk (3)

date: 2025-05-02, from: Jirka's blog

Another partial  victory. I  re-connected my ODROID,  added a  USB WiFi (the TP-Link  TK-WN725N) so now  there is  working NTP, git  and system updates (www/gopher/e-mail, too).

## Standing desk (2)

date: 2025-05-02, from: Jirka's blog

I decided to abandon the ODROID for  the standing desk. I have found my old Intel Compute Stick with Ubuntu  and connected it into the DVI port of the vp171s. After some repairs is booted and it even works.

He was a novelty then, an American politician who was a socialist. He was asked if capitalism was the normal way for humans to relate, he said no. I wonder if he still agrees, because I think that's the goal, and the reason we're in so much trouble is there really isn't an impulse to work with each other. What I've seen mostly is that when there's work to do, it's hard to find help, but once something has taken off, there isn't much help available either, the people who could make the greatest contribution just want to take over. And they often feel they have, but usually it doesn't work out, it would have been better if we all collaborated. At this point, the hurdle the human race has to get over <i>is</i> working together. We will never get out of the climate crisis without it, or avoid the next pandemic without millions of unnecessarily lost lives. The cynics are winning, basically -- and there isn't net-net much of a will for our species to survive. It's only getting worse.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-05-01, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I turned yesterday's <a href="http://scripting.com/code/baselineplayground/">Baseline Playground</a> into a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/baselinePlayground">GitHub repo</a>. I never made one of these before and thought it was worth sharing, or just writing about. I'm struggling to find the most readable font, size, line-height. I'm looking at the screen where I do most of my online writing, and I find this very readable, it just fades into the background, to the base of the spine, so intrinsic it occupies none of my conscious mind. Anyway the purpose of the baseline is to give WordLand a target to work out all the glitches in, so the writing experience goes fully end-to-end. I didn't find any WordPress themes that I felt worked really well for this, so we set out to create one. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/scotthansonde">Scott Hansen</a> who is using my work to build out a <a href="https://github.com/scotthansonde/wordlandBaseline">WordPress theme</a> and thanks to <a href="https://github.com/jeherve">Jeremy Herve</a> for helping us work with WordPress, which is more than a CMS, it's a network OS. There's a lot of value in the WordPress platform that has been widely overlooked, imho.

## lynx --nocolor

date: 2025-05-01, from: Jirka's blog

I really dislike how the Lynx WWW browser looks on some modern systems. On my  SGI it  was OK -  it simply respected  IRIS terminal  colors. On modern systems in seems to be full of colors with gray background. Text colors are quite  nice but I have disliked the  gray background. I have wished to have or black one  or transparent one (it a terminal emulator supports transparency).

## Workflow: Changes and additions

date: 2025-05-01, from: Jirka's blog

Things are continuously  developing or at least  changing. For example, my  gVim on  my GPD  Pocket (Ubuntu  MATE 18.04)  has issues  with text encoding.  If  I  create a  new  file  then  I  everything is  OK.  But when  I  save  it  and  re-open it  then  it  en-codes  local  language characters incorrectly.  It is  strange because I  have been  using the same  .vimrc/.gvimrc for  ages on  several Linux  machines and  I never encountered such behaviour.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-04-30, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Here's a <a href="http://scripting.com/code/testing/baselineplayground/index.html">prototype</a> of what a story page might look like on our baseline site for WordLand. I did this off on the side as input for the WordPress theme. I find it easier to work on style in a standalone page without much tech that can get in the way of fast iteration.

## Grifting away

date: 2025-04-30, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

According to Joseph Cox at 404, the U.S. government registered the domains thetrilliondollardinner.gov, dinnerforamerica.gov, and thetrillion.gov. All of these (correct me if I&#8217;m wrong) are about enriching the U.S. president, his family, and favored friends through a memecoin scheme by which anyone (say, Putin) can buy influence. There is nothing conservative about this. Nothing republican. [&#8230;]

## How blogs show their site title

date: 2025-04-30, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>We're working on the "baseline" theme for WordLand, the default -- the one that shows the user's writing in a WordPress context. I did a survey of news sites and blogs to see how they show their titles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gothamist.com/news/gov-hochul-says-ny-budget-will-create-50m-rental-aid-program-championed-by-tenant-groups">Gothamist</a> puts the name in the upper left corner, leaving room for some buttons and a menu in the right corner.</li>
<li><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/redditor-accidentally-reinvents-discarded-90s-tool-to-escape-todays-age-gates/">Ars Technica</a> does something similar, name of site in upper left corner, with an array of buttons flush right.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.emptywheel.net/2025/04/30/three-coequal-timelines-of-government/">Empty Wheel</a> does the same thing. (I sense a pattern here.)</li>
<li><a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2025/04/30/missouri-lawmakers-should-reject-fake-chaplains-in-schools-bill/">Missouri Independent</a> centers the title in much bigger type than the previous examples, the buttons are arrayed above it (more buttons).</li>
<li><a href="https://evgrieve.com/2025/04/east-village-mainstay-cafe-mogador.html">EV Grieve</a> puts the name in the upper left corner without much fanfare. Proves that it doesn't have to be eye-catching, it's the attitude and the content I love. One of my longtime favorites. It's an East Village neighborhood blog, running in Blogger for ages.</li>
<li><a href="https://seths.blog/2025/04/uncomfortable-ideas/">Seth's Blog</a> is a WordPress site, managed by Automattic. The left sidebar includes the title of the blog, and has a list of things he wants you to read, and how to get on his mail list, etc. So effectively the title is in the upper left corner, and the equiv of the buttons are arrayed vertically in a column. The functionality of his blog is probably closest to what I have in mind for WordLand, but into spartan beginnings. It's easy to add stuff, impossible to take away.</li>
<li><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/30/sycophancy-in-gpt-4o/#atom-everything">Simon Willison's Weblog</a>, another great example of the kind of writing I want people to do with WordLand. He puts the title in the upper left corner, with a single button flush right. He deals with the recent articles thing by putting a list of three posts, linkblog style, at the bottom. I like this placement, btw. Positioned as an afterthought. If you're lingering here, you might like this? I pretty much always ignore this kind of stuff.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.manton.org/2025/04/29/model-train-at-the-casey.html">Manton Reece</a> does the same thing everyone else is doing. Title at the top left, an array of buttons flush-right at the same level. What's uncommon about his style is that the name of his blog is tiny, 13px. But it also is very visible.</li>
<li><a href="https://kottke.org/25/04/0046739-trump-is-a-hallucinating-">Kottke</a> does not include the title of his blog on a story page. This is remarkable. But he does have the author name very prominently placed, it's the very topmost text on the page, impossible to miss. So amazingly the title is visible, even though it isn't there.</li>
<li><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/29/cheaters-and-liars/https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/29/cheaters-and-liars/https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/29/cheaters-and-liars/https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/29/cheaters-and-liars/">Pluralistic</a> puts the title in big type flush left, with a subtitle, and the buttons are below the title, before the headline of the post (lots of white space separating).</li>
</ul>

## WhatsApp Case Against NSO Group Progressing

date: 2025-04-30, updated: 2025-04-29, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Meta is suing NSO Group, <a href="https://cyberscoop.com/whatsapp-nso-group-trial-judge-limits-evidence-2025/">basically claiming</a> that the latter hacks WhatsApp and not just WhatsApp users. We have a procedural ruling:</p>
<blockquote><p>Under <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/16395340/686/whatsapp-inc-v-nso-group-technologies-limited/">the order</a>, NSO Group is prohibited from presenting evidence about its customers&#8217; identities, implying  the targeted WhatsApp users are suspected or actual criminals, or alleging that WhatsApp had insufficient security protections.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>In making her ruling, Northern District of California Judge Phyllis Hamilton said NSO Group undercut its arguments to use evidence about its customers with contradictory statements...</p></blockquote>

## lynx --nocolor

date: 2025-04-30, from: Jirka's blog

I really dislike how the Lynx WWW browser looks on some modern systems. On my  SGI it  was OK -  it simply respected  IRIS terminal  colors. On modern systems in seems to be full of colors with gray background. Text colors are quite  nice but I have disliked the  gray background. I have wished to have or black one  or transparent one (it a terminal emulator supports transparency).

## iMac G5 keyboard

date: 2025-04-30, from: Jirka's blog

Today  my  wife  requested  new  keyboard. I  thought  that  the  Apple white-transparent keyboard is too inferior  to her IBM laptop keyboard. Well, it is. So I have replaced it by spare HP one. A HP keyboard which was a part of the PA-RISC Visualize workstation (the workstation itself does not work, unfortunately). And she is happy with it.

## Workflow: Changes and additions

date: 2025-04-30, from: Jirka's blog

Things are continuously  developing or at least  changing. For example, my  gVim on  my GPD  Pocket (Ubuntu  MATE 18.04)  has issues  with text encoding.  If  I  create a  new  file  then  I  everything is  OK.  But when  I  save  it  and  re-open it  then  it  en-codes  local  language characters incorrectly.  It is  strange because I  have been  using the same  .vimrc/.gvimrc for  ages on  several Linux  machines and  I never encountered such behaviour.

## OpenBSD 7.7 released with updated hardware support, 9Front ships second update of 2025

<h4>The OS refresh brings Ryzen AI and Arrow Lake compatibility</h4>

New howto: <a href="https://this.how/feedland/editingSubscriptions.opml">Editing subscription lists</a>. I'm doing a project with a friend who hasn't used <a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a>. I want him to maintain a subscription list which will then be the source for a Bluesky account. Any time the OPML changes, of course, the channel adjusts, so they have full power to add and remove feeds. "Just enough FeedLand."

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-04-29, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> defines a network of services and readers. Each one can go down, but the whole network stays up. That's all that Bluesky has promised, and that's why a layer of RSS on top of Bluesky would deliver a huge portion of the stability they've promised and would need to survive a disaster. It could be done in a matter of weeks, if they decided to do it. I would help.

Usually I don't criticize a service when it's down, because I can relate. We like to help each other when there are outages. But Bluesky is special, because they claim to be decentralized. If it were, it wouldn't go down unless the internet itself had. And since the internet, amazingly, <i>is</i> decentralized, that's not likely to happen. It was designed that way when it was developed at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">Arpanet</a>, a project of the US Department of Defense. It was designed to survive a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET#Inspiration">nuclear strike</a>. Bluesky is nice, but it's fragile, and their hype says otherwise. That's why they're special. They should straighten this out so we can properly get decentralization into <i>our</i> networks. Bluesky could easily add a layer of <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> on top of what they have, so that news flow could survive a disaster.  In 2025 this is a realistic concern, as it was in the 1960s. Also it would be nice if other network experts would support this, esp if they're on Bluesky. This is not personal, if they wanted to get the RSS layer built, I would help them do it. We should all pitch in because then it would really be our network, and not owned by anyone. Live up to the promise, now.

## The State of Open Source in 2025? Honestly, it's a mess but you knew that already

## Applying Security Engineering to Prompt Injection Security

date: 2025-04-29, updated: 2025-04-29, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>This seems like an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/04/researchers-claim-breakthrough-in-fight-against-ais-frustrating-security-hole/">important advance</a> in LLM security against prompt injection:</p>
<blockquote><p>Google DeepMind has <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18813">unveiled CaMeL</a> (CApabilities for MachinE Learning), a new approach to stopping prompt-injection attacks that abandons the failed strategy of having AI models police themselves. Instead, CaMeL treats language models as fundamentally untrusted components within a secure software framework, creating clear boundaries between user commands and potentially malicious content.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>To understand CaMeL, you need to understand that prompt injections happen when AI systems can&#8217;t distinguish between legitimate user commands and malicious instructions hidden in content they&#8217;re processing...</p></blockquote>

## lynx --nocolor

date: 2025-04-29, from: Jirka's blog

I really dislike how the Lynx WWW browser looks on some modern systems. On my  SGI it  was OK -  it simply respected  IRIS terminal  colors. On modern systems in seems to be full of colors with gray background. Text colors are quite  nice but I have disliked the  gray background. I have wished to have or black one  or transparent one (it a terminal emulator supports transparency).

Today  my  wife  requested  new  keyboard. I  thought  that  the  Apple white-transparent keyboard is too inferior  to her IBM laptop keyboard. Well, it is. So I have replaced it by spare HP one. A HP keyboard which was a part of the PA-RISC Visualize workstation (the workstation itself does not work, unfortunately). And she is happy with it.

## Workflow: Changes and additions

date: 2025-04-29, from: Jirka's blog

Things are continuously  developing or at least  changing. For example, my  gVim on  my GPD  Pocket (Ubuntu  MATE 18.04)  has issues  with text encoding.  If  I  create a  new  file  then  I  everything is  OK.  But when  I  save  it  and  re-open it  then  it  en-codes  local  language characters incorrectly.  It is  strange because I  have been  using the same  .vimrc/.gvimrc for  ages on  several Linux  machines and  I never encountered such behaviour.

## Windscribe Acquitted on Charges of Not Collecting Users‚Äô Data

<p>The case centred around a Windscribe-owned server in Finland that was allegedly used to breach a system in Greece. Greek authorities, in cooperation with INTERPOL, traced the IP address to Windscribe&#8217;s infrastructure and, unlike standard international procedures, proceeded to initiate criminal proceedings against Sak himself, rather than pursuing information through standard corporate channels...</p></blockquote>

## Don't let your voice be flattened by the √ºber theme

date: 2025-04-28, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>I want you to have a blog. Despite this being nearly my entire online ethos, one situation I struggle with are design systems and UX blogs on Medium. A lot of them exist. Yet. I have difficulty understanding UX and design professionals in this space who yield their UX and design decisions over to the ‚Äúeveryone looks the same‚Äù content silo.</p>
<p>To be fair, I get why you or an organization would want to use a service like Medium:</p>
<ul>
<li>People are busy and maintaining a blog is work.</li>
<li>It‚Äôs hard for the design team to get dev resources for a custom site.</li>
<li>There‚Äôs ‚Äúfree‚Äù community engagement there.</li>
<li>There‚Äôs even monetization paths.</li>
<li>Self-publishing obsessed dorks aren‚Äôt the target market.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don‚Äôt get me wrong‚Äì I‚Äôd rather have more blogs than no blogs so if that‚Äôs your situation don‚Äôt mind me and my niche beef. But consider for a moment that I can‚Äôt tell you the last Medium post I‚Äôve read because they‚Äôre all the same to me. I follow a lot of UX and design systems blogs‚Ä¶ but I can‚Äôt tell you a single person who writes on Medium. Those posts and authors have all blended together into a monolithic groupthinkpiece where individual voices and personality are flattened by the √ºber theme.</p>
<p>If everyone is wearing the same uniform, you all look the same. You are interchangeable. Your voice exists in a crowded space of vanilla platitudes. A recent WIRED article suggested over <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-generated-medium-posts-content-moderation/">40% of the content on Medium is AI generated</a> slop. I think the question for you ‚Äìand for me‚Äì is how do you stand out in this <em>fancy copy-pasted</em> new world? My personal belief is that the answer starts with your own personal website that looks like you, talks like you, smells like you, and has quirks like you. I want that for you.</p>

## Dems get on the air!

date: 2025-04-28, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I‚Äôm sick of saying this <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lnunfkdru22h">over and over</a>, the Dems need a regular snark-filled irreverent presence on social media to condemn every freaking fascist thing the Trumps do. They had it with the Kamala accounts, but they shut them down on Election Day. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs so freaking simple. Not having a raging presence on social media in the future will be seen as like a successful company not being listed on the NYSE, or a country not having a rep at the United Nations. Aside from the cost of keeping a staff online 24x7, it's free, and serves as its own money-raising channel.</p>
<p>The Repubs figured this out in 2016. </p>
<p>Maybe what the Dems need is some entrepreneurs and comedians at the top to actually get through to voters that say "Hey we're the Dems, we're here and we love America and we love you, Americans!" And actually make a stink when they try to kill Social Security.</p>
<p>Another purpose -- tell people when the next pandemic is here. You know the Trumps aren't going to do that.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-04-28, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I mentioned this in <a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/04/27/chatgptDeservesOurRespectAtLeast.html">yesterday's podcast</a> -- new problems popped up with websockets in WordLand. I worked through the whole tree of possibilities with ChatGPT and it came to the conclusion that the source was an out of date package, and it was confident if I replaced it with the one "everyone else" is using, the problems will go away. Now this is the moment when human judgement prevails. I'm going to experiment in a very small app first, to make sure I have the approach right, then I will cautiously make the change on my test WordLand server, and if it works there, then I will figure out how to install it on the main site. It couldn't break all that much because for some reason the WS code stopped working, completely, with no code changes anywhere.

Well it looks like the <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/04/27/130611.html">new email app</a> is working. I got some really nice lookin emails last night, hope you did too. Subscribe <a href="https://subscribe.scripting.com/">here</a>. And there's a basis on which to build. I will now proceed to turn off the old email app that has been serving us so well since 2017 or thereabouts. Goodbye old friend. Hello new world!

## lynx --nocolor

date: 2025-04-28, from: Jirka's blog

I really dislike how the Lynx WWW browser looks on some modern systems. On my  SGI it  was OK -  it simply respected  IRIS terminal  colors. On modern systems in seems to be full of colors with gray background. Text colors are quite  nice but I have disliked the  gray background. I have wished to have or black one  or transparent one (it a terminal emulator supports transparency).

## iMac G5 keyboard

date: 2025-04-28, from: Jirka's blog

Today  my  wife  requested  new  keyboard. I  thought  that  the  Apple white-transparent keyboard is too inferior  to her IBM laptop keyboard. Well, it is. So I have replaced it by spare HP one. A HP keyboard which was a part of the PA-RISC Visualize workstation (the workstation itself does not work, unfortunately). And she is happy with it.

## Workflow: Changes and additions

date: 2025-04-28, from: Jirka's blog

Things are continuously  developing or at least  changing. For example, my  gVim on  my GPD  Pocket (Ubuntu  MATE 18.04)  has issues  with text encoding.  If  I  create a  new  file  then  I  everything is  OK.  But when  I  save  it  and  re-open it  then  it  en-codes  local  language characters incorrectly.  It is  strange because I  have been  using the same  .vimrc/.gvimrc for  ages on  several Linux  machines and  I never encountered such behaviour.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-04-27, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

Lots of news reports about Trump's polls. But it isn't surprising that in the transition from a democracy to autocracy the people would become increasingly unhappy with the change, until we basically give up, and the polls from some pollsters are always this way, but the polls from others tell a different story. Fox News still runs polls the old way, as does the NYT and others. But that will change, as the lawyers have, and the Washington Post and NY Times have, in their editorial functions. And they just arrested a judge in Wisconsin. Makes you think maybe it doesn't matter if the polls say what they say, if there isn't something behind them.

## Nightly email switchover

date: 2025-04-27, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>If all goes as planned, if you're subscribed to the <a href="http://scripting.com/email/">nightly email</a>, you should get two copies of the posts for April 27, one sent by the old software, and one sent by the new. The new version might look better in your mail reader app. That was the point of this transition. </p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdBkVybd_vaWT4oen5uNAEKxK8ztFUvAStcCq0Y8m-0VSsTNQ/viewform?usp=header">Google form</a> where you can let me know how it went. Did it work? How many emails did you get? Does the v2 email look better than the old version? In general do you want to comment?</p>
<p><b>The story</b></p>
<p>I had to do a rewrite because when I originally wrote it, I misunderstood how CSS styling works in some/most email clients and it required a very deep rewrite of the software, it was actually harder to do the conversion than it was to write the software in the first place. And the app was running on an old version of PagePark and depended on Dropbox, and had broken in many ways over the years. But I never had the time to zero in on this. </p>
<p>Now was the time to do it, because I want to do an <i>excellent</i> email sender for <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>. And in order for that to have even a small chance of working, I needed to do this transition, to get fully up to date on the best practices for HTML email in 2025. </p>
<p>And yet another plug for ChatGPT. It's like having a library of medical journals for a general practitioner. I'm sure they have this, if a GP has a question about which specialist to send a patient to. And then they probably have good reference materials for the specialist too, to be sure they're using the latest proven techniques for treating disease. Believe it or not we have nothing like this in software development. Which means we don't interop, and don't use prior art and are constantly reinventing each others' work because there's no way to find out about it. No conferences, no journals, nothing but hearsay and O'Reilly books and I hear they aren't very good these days. Enter ChatGPT, and all of a sudden if you have a question it has the freaking answer. It's as if medicine went from the pre-internet days to now, in just a couple of years. Only more so because medicine was considered a discipline, where developing software never has been. Now at least us practitioners have the tools if not the respect. </p>
<p>PS: The <a href="http://scripting.com/email/">signup page</a> moved to <a href="https://subscribe.scripting.com/">subscribe.scripting.com</a>. It's the same software now running on my latest server software, and served via HTTPS.</p>

Many people loved him based on the outpouring of grief, but I didn't. They had keynotes and panels about stuff I was working on at the time, in the 90s and 00s, blogging, RSS, podcasting, bringing blogs to politics. He wouldn't take my calls. I wanted to be on stage to talk about what I was working on, and to set the record straight on what we had created. Instead my competitors got top billing and I was not allowed in. It felt corrupt to me, as if someone was trading favors behind the scenes. My hope is now SXSW, or whatever replaces it, will be more open-minded about who they include in the show. I'm still working and still have a story to tell.
