<h2 id="youtubes-new-anti-adblock-measures">YouTube’s new anti-adblock
measures</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>Over the past few months, YouTube has been trying another round of
anti-adblock measures. Currently the anti-adblock stuff is being A/B
tested, and one of my accounts is in the experimental group. I wrote a
filter that partially avoids one of the anti-adblock measures, fake
buffering, on uBlock Origin (and Brave browser, since it uses the same
filter rules). (It’s already in the default filter lists, you don’t need
to manually add the filter.) One thing that people have ran into is
“fake buffering”, where videos will take a while to load due to a lot of
buffering, but only at the very start of the video (there’s no mid-video
fake buffering). As I’ll explain, the fake buffering is 80% of the
length of the ads you would’ve seen, so even with fake buffering you’re
still saving time using an adblocker. ↫ iter.ca The battle between
YouTube on one side, and users wanting a non-shitty experience without
paying for YouTube Premium on the other, is unlikely to end any time
soon. Your computer, your rules, so I’m on the side of the people
wanting to block ads on YouTube – the same applies to OSNews if you
don’t want to pay for our ad-free version – but I’m still intrigued to
find out just how far Google is willing to go. I sometimes see YouTube
with ads at other people’s homes. It’s a nightmare.</p>

<h2 id="cosmoe-beoshaiku-on-linux-returns-from-18-year-hiatus">Cosmoe,
BeOS/Haiku on Linux, returns from 18 year hiatus</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s 2025, and we’re going to talk about BeOS, AtheOS, Cosmoe, and
OpenBeOS, all in one news item, right here, right now, on OSNews. In the
very early 2000s, Cosmoe was a unique project that started out as a
merger of the AtheOS userland with the Linux kernel. AtheOS, in turn,
was one of the quintessential hobby operating systems of the golden age
of the advanced hobby operating systems, the early 2000s. AtheOS would
eventually be abandoned in 2002, but would be forked into Syllable and
continue development until it, too, was eventually abandoned in 2012.
Cosmoe was the brainchild of Bill Hayden, and originally consisted of
the AtheOS userland running on top of the Linux kernel, in order to
address the lack of supported hardware a custom operating system kernel
inevitably has to deal with. Not long after the start of Cosmoe, AtheOS
was abandoned, as mentioned above, but a new project had entered the
scene: OpenBeOS, now known as Haiku. Hayden switched gears, and instead
started porting the parts that made up OpenBeOS to run on the Linux
kernel. This project progressed nicely, but in 2007 Cosmoe came to a
halt (ironically, our last item about Cosmoe is “Cosmoe is back“) as
Hayden had no more free time left to work on it, being a father of five,
and so he decided to put the project on hold indefinitely. That is,
until last year, when everything changed. In mid-2024, my 3rd son
Joshua, not even born when I started this project but who is now in
college studying to be a programmer himself, had some questions about
operating systems. I decided to dust off Cosmoe and see if I could get
it running again, to show him what I had worked on. At first it would
only compile and run on extremely old 32-bit versions of Mandrake Linux
from 2007. But I had caught the bug again. Not only had I forgotten how
fun Cosmoe was to program, but the intervening 17 years of progress made
by OpenBeOS (now Haiku) made the certain aspects of this revival come at
lightning speed. Day by day, week by week, I got it running on newer
versions of Linux, and re-synchronized it with ever-more-recent releases
of Haiku. After about 2 months of late-night effort, I had a version of
Cosmoe that was 64-bit compatible, ran on multiple modern Linux
releases, and was almost completely up-to-date with the latest Haiku
source changes. ↫ Cosmoe’s history page We’re halfway through 2025 now,
and Cosmoe now exists as two separate, but related projects. There’s
Cosmoe Classic, which is the updated and modernised incarnation of
Cosmoe’s original concept: Haiku’s userland running on top of the Linux
kernel. In its current form, it runs inside an SDL window on your Linux
desktop, as there’s no native video driver. Cosmoe Classic, however, is
not what Hayden is focusing on. Instead, Hayden is focusing on the new
Cosmoe, which takes the same idea – the Haiku userland running on a
Linux kernel – but implements it in a completely different way: Cosmoe
is a C++ class library that allows developers to build rich, native
Linux apps with the easy-to-use BeOS API. This library is a
light-weight, serverless version of Cosmoe Classic which targets the
Wayland compositor on Linux. ↫ Cosmoe’s GitLab page What Cosmoe on
Wayland (to differentiate it from Cosmoe Classic) allows you to do is
run BeOS/Haiku applications on Linux, provided you are running Wayland.
The project is in an alpha state, but once compiled, it comes with a few
BeOS/Haiku sample applications you can run right on your Wayland-based
Linux desktop. Hayden states that about 95% of the BeOS API is
implemented in Cosmoe, with the TODO file giving an idea of what tasks
need to be done to improve compatibility and implement other
improvements. The return of Cosmoe is certainly not something I saw
coming, but I’m incredibly excited. I’m not entirely sure about the
usefulness of running Haiku applications on Wayland on Linux, but who
the hell cares – this is an awesome project, with a ton of cherished
history behind it that gives me butterflies in my stomach. It’s
absolutely beautiful to see a project like this come back to life in
2025. Cosmoe is back. Again.</p>

id="libxml2-maintainer-ends-embargoed-vulnerability-reports-citing-unsustainable-burden">libxml2
maintainer ends embargoed vulnerability reports, citing unsustainable
burden</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>The lone volunteer maintainer of libxml2, one of the open source
ecosystem’s most widely used XML parsing libraries, has announced a
policy shift that drops support for embargoed security vulnerability
reports. This change highlights growing frustration among unpaid
maintainers bearing the brunt of big tech’s security demands without
compensation or support. Wellnhofer’s blunt assessment is that
coordinated disclosure mostly benefits large tech companies while
leaving maintainers doing unpaid work. He criticized the OpenSSF and
Linux Foundation membership costs as a financial barrier to single
person maintainers gaining additional support. ↫ Sarah Gooding The
problem is that, according to Wellnhofer, libxml2 was never supposed to
be widely used, but now every major technology company with billions in
quarterly revenue are basically expecting an unpaid maintainer to fix
the security issues – many of which questionable – they throw his way.
The point is that libxml2 never had the quality to be used in mainstream
browsers or operating systems to begin with. It all started when Apple
made libxml2 a core component of all their OSes. Then Google followed
suit and now even Microsoft is using libxml2 in their OS outside of
Edge. This should have never happened. Originally it was kind of a
growth hack, but now these companies make billions of profits and refuse
to pay back their technical debt, either by switching to better
solutions, developing their own or by trying to improve libxml2. The
behavior of these companies is irresponsible. Even if they claim
otherwise, they don’t care about the security and privacy of their
users. They only try to fix symptoms. ↫ Nick Wellnhofer It’s wild that a
library never intended to be widely used in any critical infrastructure
is now used all over the place, even though it just does not have the
level of quality and security needed to perform such a role. These are
the words of Wellnhofer himself – an addition to the project’s readme
now makes this point very clear, and I absolutely love the wording: This
is open-source software written by hobbyists, maintained by a
singlevolunteer, badly tested, written in a memory-unsafe language and
full ofsecurity bugs. It is foolish to use this software to process
untrusted data.As such, we treat security issues like any other bug.
Each security reportwe receive will be made public immediately and won’t
be prioritized. ↫ libxml2’s readme If you want libxml2 to fulfill a role
it was never intended to fulfill, make it happen. With contributions.
With money. Don’t just throw a whole slew of security demands a sole
maintainer’s way and hope he will do the work for you.</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>Welcome news coming out of Jolla, the company that develops Sailfish
OS. Up until now, if you bought their Jolla C2 smartphone, you had to
pay a yearly subscription fee in order to get updates (with the first
year included in the purchase price). Today they’ve announced their
dropping this construction, and they now guarantee five years of free
updates. We’re happy to announce that from now onwards long-term
Sailfish OS updates are included free-of-charge to all Jolla C2 devices
for a minimum of 5 years. This applies also to everybody who have
already purchased the Jolla C2. ↫ Announcement at the Jolla forums
People don’t like subscriptions, and I wouldn’t be surprised if Jolla
was simply running into a lot of resistance to this subscription model
from potential customers. Nobody likes subscriptions, and I think that
counts doubly so for the kinds of people interested in buying a phone
like the C2 with Sailfish OS.</p>

<h2 id="liberux-nexx-a-linux-smartphone-built-in-europe">Liberux Nexx: a
Linux smartphone built in Europe</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>With the possibility that Google is going to make some big changes to
the open source status of Android, the importance of smartphones that
don’t run either iOS or (some form of) Android is definitely increasing.
Linux on smartphones is not as complete as iOS or Android, and I
personally think one of the primary reasons for that is a lack of easy
access to devices that don’t require manual installation or other forms
of hackery, only to then end up with a partially supported device
because the device in question was never originally designed to run
regular Linux. A few companies are trying to change this, developing
Linux-first smartphones instead. One of the newcomers here is Liberux, a
Spanish company who just unveiled the crowdfunding campaign for their
Liberux Nexx, a Debian-powered smartphone with excellent specifications
and some unique additions you won’t find on any other smartphone. It’s
powered by an octa-core Rockchip RK3588S (four Cortex-A76 cores and four
Cortex-A55 cores up to 2.4 GHz), 32 GB LPDDR4x RAM, tons of expendable
storage, and a 6.34″ 2400×1080 OLED display. At the top of the device
sit something you won’t find on many other smartphones: dedicated
hardware switches to physically cut power to the modem, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth
chip, and the microhone/camera array. When all three switches are
disabled, a number of other features, like GPS and sensors, are also
turned off. On top of all this, various internal components are designed
to be replaceable and possibly even upgradeable, with manufacturing of
the device taking place in Europe – which probably refers to assembly,
but still. The device is supposed to become open source, too. It will
run Debian 13 with a customised version of the mobile GNOME Shell using
a standard Linux kernel. Android applications will also be supported
using Waydroid, which you’ll most likely have to rely on for things like
banking and other application categories exclusive to iOS and Android.
Liberux promises that any development done on both the Linux
distribution and other related applications will be done openly, which
is something we can hold them to quite easily. I’m always weary of
crowdfunding campaigns, and all the usual caveats, warnings, and
concerns still apply here. I’m highlighting this campaign because I feel
like many of the kinds of people who read OSNews are longing for a
modern, capable smartphone that runs not iOS or Android, but proper
Linux, even if Linux on smartphones isn’t quite there yet to go
toe-to-toe with the two duopolists. For more information on the device
and the people involved, be sure to read LINMOB.net’s excellent
interview with Liberux. Liberux has told me they want to send over a
review device once development has reached a point where that’s
possible. So, assuming the crowdfunding campaign is successful, you can
look forward to a review of the Liberux Nexx on OSNews somewhere between
now and mid-2026.</p>

<h2 id="accessibility-programming-doesnt-feel-accessible">Accessibility
programming doesn’t feel accessible</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-18, from: OS News</p>
<p>Accessibility is something that doesn’t get nearly enough attention,
especially considering because not only will we need accessibility
features eventually as we grow older, but also because a lot of
accessibility features are just helpful even if you don’t technically
need them. Given these facts, it’s a shame that accessibility is usually
an afterthought, doubly so on open source desktops, a problem we
recently talked about. But what if you don’t just need to use a few
applications as, say, a blind person, but also actually program as a
blind person? Acidic Light, accessibility engineer at KDE e.V., has
published a blog post about how screen readers actually work, and what
it’s like to program while blind, and the conclusions are not exactly
great. I truly feel that, based on my experience with KDE and my
experience actually delving into the weeds with AccessKit in a custom UI
system, that accessibility programming just isn’t accessible. Unless you
happen to already understand the way each platform works, trying to find
resources on how to actually let a screen reader know your UI exists is
just painful. It’s going to involve reading code other people have
already written. It’s going to involve hours, if not days, if not weeks
of research and painful debugging. You likely won’t be able to ask many
people for help, because they’ll know as much as you do. ↫ Acidic Light
If the people who know most what is needed to make a program accessible
have so many problems actually making programs accessible, because the
tooling, documentation, and institutional knowledge just isn’t there,
what hope do other programmers have to make their code accessible? If a
blind programmer can’t scratch their own itch, so to speak, we’re never
going to reach a point where accessibility becomes a given. I’m very
happy awareness of accessibility is growing, but I feel like this isn’t
the first time we’ve seen an increase in accessibility awareness only
for it to eventually fizzle out without meaningful improvements for
those that need it the most. I really hope it sticks this time.</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>A new version of Plasma is here, and it feels even more like /home,
as it becomes smoother, friendlier and more helpful. Plasma 6.4 improves
on nearly every front, with progress being made in accessibility, color
rendering, tablet support, window management, and more. ↫ KDE Plasma 6.4
release announcement KDE Plasma 6.4 comes with a big improvement in
window and virtual desktop management, allowing you to create entirely
custom tiled configurations per virtual desktop. Accessibility was
another focus of this release, as we talked about a few weeks ago,
bringing number pad mouse pointer navigation, improved desktop zoom,
screen readers improvements, better contrast i the dark theme, tons of
little legibility improvements across the desktop environment and its
applications, and more. Furthermore, there’s now finally a dedicated
page in Settings for animations, so you no longer have to dig your way
through the oddly placed and obtuse Desktop Effects page. Notifications
have been improved as well, with new additions like a speed graph in
file transfer notifications or Plasma notifying you when you’re trying
to use a muted microphone input. KRunner can now visualise colours when
searching for a hex code, Spectacle has received some love, various
widgets have been touched up, and much more. There’s a brand new HDR
wizard, support for Extended Dynamic Range, and the addition of the P010
video color format. System Monitor will now show usage information for
Intel and AMD GPUs, and Info Center will show raw sensor data from the
sensors in your device. There’s a ton more, as this is a fairly major
release. You can download and compile KDE Plasma 6.4 now, or just wait a
few days until it lands in your distribution’s repository.</p>

id="haikus-development-activity-seems-to-be-shifting-from-the-operating-system-to-its-applications">Haiku’s
development activity seems to be shifting from the operating system to
its applications</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>I hate how these months keep going down like vodka-martinis on an
Italian beach, but at least we get another progress report for Haiku
every time. Aside from the usual small changes and bug fixes, the most
important of which is probably allowing the EXT4 driver to read and
write again, there’s this little paragraph at the end which definitely
stands out. This month was a bit lighter than usual, it seems most of
the developers (myself included) were busy with other things… However,
HaikuPorts remained quite active: most months, at this point, there are
more commits to HaikuPorts than Haiku, and sometimes by a significant
margin, too (for May, it was 52 in Haiku vs. 258 in HaikuPorts!). I
think overall this is a sign of Haiku’s growing maturity: the system
seems stable enough that the porters can do their work without
uncovering too many bugs in Haiku that interrupt or halt their progress.
↫ Haiku activity report for May I definitely hope that this positive
read is correct, as it would be a shame for the project to run into
declining activity and contributions just as it seems to be serving as a
solid base for quite a wide variety of applications. I’ve definitely
been seeing more and more people giving Haiku a try lately and coming
away impressed, but of course, that’s just anecdotal and I have no idea
if that means Haiku has reached a certain point of maturity. One thing
that definitely does indicate Haiku is a lot more stable and generally
usable than most people think is the massive amount solid ports the
platform can handle, from Firefox to LibreOffice, and everything in
between. I think a lot of people would be surprised by just how far they
can get with their day-to-day computing needs with Haiku, assuming their
hardware can boot Haiku and is properly supported, of course. My opinion
on Haiku has not changed, but I’m a random idiot you shouldn’t be
listening to. The cold and harsh truth is that old people like me who
want their BeOS boomerware but in 2025, are a small minority who are
impossible to please. The Haiku team’s focus on getting modern software
ported to Haiku, instead or trying to convince people to code brand new
native Haiku applications, is objectively the correct choice to ensure
the viability of the platform going forward. If Haiku wishes to fully
outgrow its hobby status, looking towards the future is a far better
approach than clinging to the past, and unsurprisingly, Haiku’s
developers are more than smart enough to realise that.</p>

<h2 id="making-gnomes-gdkpixbuf-image-loading-safer">Making GNOME’s
GdkPixbuf image loading safer</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>A new image loading machinery, called glycin, has been in the works
for a while. It is already used by GNOME’s default Image Viewer (Loupe),
as well as by a bunch of other apps. Glycin provides many security
benefits over existing solutions due to the use of the Rust programming
language and sandboxing. Distributions will now be able to use the
security benefits and broader format support of glycin for other GNOME
apps, thumbnailers, and GNOME Shell, whithout changing any existing
software. This is made possible by a new option for GNOME’s legacy
image-loading library, GdkPixbuf, to use glycin internally. ↫ Sophie
Herold Clearly, this is an improvement over the previous image loading
library, but there’s a bit of a catch that is in line with GNOME’s
increased reliance on systemd features: glycin only works on Linux due
to its sandbox mechanisms and how it communicates with its loaders.
However, there’s no need to fret this time, and that’s why I’m posting
this item – you just know this tiny little tidbit will find their way
into internet discussion forums and social media as another example of
GNOME not caring about non-Linux users. While some of the sandboxing and
communication features in glycin can be made to work on the BSDs and
perhaps macOS, it won’t be perfect. As such, great care has been taken
to ensure non-Linux platforms can continue to use GdkPixbuf just fine,
since support for other platforms is part of the goals of this change
before traditional loaders are removed. As a general solution for other
platforms, I am planning a mechanism to compile the loaders into the
library. This will not provide sandboxing and format extendability
without recompilation. But since most loaders are written in Rust, this
is still a huge step-up security wise. Contributions for support on
other platforms are welcome. For GdkPixbuf users, this will not pose an
immediate issue since traditional gdk-pixbuf loaders are not going away
until all platforms it supported, are supported by glycin. ↫ Sophie
Herold There are a few other issues, as any change like this tends to
cause, like the list of supported images formats. Glycin supports AVIF,
BMP, DDS, Farbfeld, QOI, GIF, HEIC, ICO, JPEG, JPEG XL, OpenEXR, PNG,
PNM, SVG, TGA, TIFF, and WEBP out of the box, but some of the subformats
within each of these might potentially not work entirely correctly due
to incorrect implementations by, say, camera manufacturers. A special
case here is the TIFF format, which apparently still has a number of
issues and might end up relying on a fallback. Glycin brings a ton of
benefits, such as improved colour support for things like HDR and wider
colour gamut displays, better metadata support, basic image editing
functions out of the box, increased performance, as well as the benefits
inherent in using a memory-safe language like Rust.</p>

user surprised when 1960s computer panel emerged from collapsed family
garage</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>Recently, a Reddit user discovered a rare RCA Spectra 70/35 computer
control panel from 1966 in their family’s old collapsed garage, posting
photos of the pre-moon landing mainframe component to the
“retrobattlestations” subreddit that celebrates vintage computers. After
cleaning the panel and fixing most keyswitches, the original poster
noted that actually running it would require “1,500lbs of mainframe”—the
rest of the computer system that’s missing. ↫ Benj Edwards at Ars
Technica Apparently, no photos of this panel existed online, and it may
be one of the few – if only – ‘surviving’ example of such a panel. Of
course, it’s effectively useless without all of the other chunks that
make up the entire Spectra mainframe, but it’s still an interesting
find. The person who found it intends to turn it into what is
essentially a piece of home decor, but maybe we’ll get lucky and someone
else out there who has been collecting parts and pieces to assemble a
working RCA Spectra 70/35 can do something more productive with it.</p>

25.8 removes support for Windows 7, 8, and 8.1</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Are you still using Windows 7, 8, 8.1, or a 32 bit version of
Windows, relying on LibreOffice for your sexy office tasks of writing
TPS reports and calculating and tabulating juicy, plump numbers? Bad
news: the next version of LibreOffice will remove support for these
platforms. Buried deep in the release notes of the second beta for
LibreOffice 25.8, it reads: Support for Windows 7 and 8/8.1 was removed.
Support for x86 (32-bit) Windows builds is deprecated. ↫ LibreOffice
25.8 beta 2 release notes I honestly doubt many people actually still
rely on LibreOffice on these platforms, and even if for some
unfathomable reason you do, you are probably also okay with sticking
with an older version of LibreOffice to keep your weird setup going a
few years longer. You do you.</p>

<h2 id="an-excuse-to-mention-void-linux-xbps-0.60-released">An excuse to
mention Void Linux: XBPS 0.60 released</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Since Void Linux uses a rolling release model, there’s not much to
report on in the form of new releases and major new features, so I’m
taking the release of version 0.60 of XBPS, Void Linux’ package manager,
to cheat my way into talking about this excellent Linux distribution. I
always think of Void as the “BSD of Linux distributions”, which should
give you some vague hint as to what it’s going for. XBPS 0.60 doesn’t
come packed with major new features either, and mostly fixes a ton of
bugs, addresses few memory leaks, and changes the way held dependencies
and directory removal/creation works when reinstalling a packages, just
to name a few. There’s also some performance improvements, as there were
apparently some problems in that department due to the increasing number
of virtual packages in the Void repository. If you’re looking for a more
traditional, hands-on Linux distribution, Void is an excellent choice.
It’s my back-up for if (let’s face it: when) Fedora messes something
up.</p>
