<p>date: 2025-06-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>A new version of Plasma is here, and it feels even more like /home,
as it becomes smoother, friendlier and more helpful. Plasma 6.4 improves
on nearly every front, with progress being made in accessibility, color
rendering, tablet support, window management, and more. ↫ KDE Plasma 6.4
release announcement KDE Plasma 6.4 comes with a big improvement in
window and virtual desktop management, allowing you to create entirely
custom tiled configurations per virtual desktop. Accessibility was
another focus of this release, as we talked about a few weeks ago,
bringing number pad mouse pointer navigation, improved desktop zoom,
screen readers improvements, better contrast i the dark theme, tons of
little legibility improvements across the desktop environment and its
applications, and more. Furthermore, there’s now finally a dedicated
page in Settings for animations, so you no longer have to dig your way
through the oddly placed and obtuse Desktop Effects page. Notifications
have been improved as well, with new additions like a speed graph in
file transfer notifications or Plasma notifying you when you’re trying
to use a muted microphone input. KRunner can now visualise colours when
searching for a hex code, Spectacle has received some love, various
widgets have been touched up, and much more. There’s a brand new HDR
wizard, support for Extended Dynamic Range, and the addition of the P010
video color format. System Monitor will now show usage information for
Intel and AMD GPUs, and Info Center will show raw sensor data from the
sensors in your device. There’s a ton more, as this is a fairly major
release. You can download and compile KDE Plasma 6.4 now, or just wait a
few days until it lands in your distribution’s repository.</p>

id="haikus-development-activity-seems-to-be-shifting-from-the-operating-system-to-its-applications">Haiku’s
development activity seems to be shifting from the operating system to
its applications</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>I hate how these months keep going down like vodka-martinis on an
Italian beach, but at least we get another progress report for Haiku
every time. Aside from the usual small changes and bug fixes, the most
important of which is probably allowing the EXT4 driver to read and
write again, there’s this little paragraph at the end which definitely
stands out. This month was a bit lighter than usual, it seems most of
the developers (myself included) were busy with other things… However,
HaikuPorts remained quite active: most months, at this point, there are
more commits to HaikuPorts than Haiku, and sometimes by a significant
margin, too (for May, it was 52 in Haiku vs. 258 in HaikuPorts!). I
think overall this is a sign of Haiku’s growing maturity: the system
seems stable enough that the porters can do their work without
uncovering too many bugs in Haiku that interrupt or halt their progress.
↫ Haiku activity report for May I definitely hope that this positive
read is correct, as it would be a shame for the project to run into
declining activity and contributions just as it seems to be serving as a
solid base for quite a wide variety of applications. I’ve definitely
been seeing more and more people giving Haiku a try lately and coming
away impressed, but of course, that’s just anecdotal and I have no idea
if that means Haiku has reached a certain point of maturity. One thing
that definitely does indicate Haiku is a lot more stable and generally
usable than most people think is the massive amount solid ports the
platform can handle, from Firefox to LibreOffice, and everything in
between. I think a lot of people would be surprised by just how far they
can get with their day-to-day computing needs with Haiku, assuming their
hardware can boot Haiku and is properly supported, of course. My opinion
on Haiku has not changed, but I’m a random idiot you shouldn’t be
listening to. The cold and harsh truth is that old people like me who
want their BeOS boomerware but in 2025, are a small minority who are
impossible to please. The Haiku team’s focus on getting modern software
ported to Haiku, instead or trying to convince people to code brand new
native Haiku applications, is objectively the correct choice to ensure
the viability of the platform going forward. If Haiku wishes to fully
outgrow its hobby status, looking towards the future is a far better
approach than clinging to the past, and unsurprisingly, Haiku’s
developers are more than smart enough to realise that.</p>

<h2 id="making-gnomes-gdkpixbuf-image-loading-safer">Making GNOME’s
GdkPixbuf image loading safer</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>A new image loading machinery, called glycin, has been in the works
for a while. It is already used by GNOME’s default Image Viewer (Loupe),
as well as by a bunch of other apps. Glycin provides many security
benefits over existing solutions due to the use of the Rust programming
language and sandboxing. Distributions will now be able to use the
security benefits and broader format support of glycin for other GNOME
apps, thumbnailers, and GNOME Shell, whithout changing any existing
software. This is made possible by a new option for GNOME’s legacy
image-loading library, GdkPixbuf, to use glycin internally. ↫ Sophie
Herold Clearly, this is an improvement over the previous image loading
library, but there’s a bit of a catch that is in line with GNOME’s
increased reliance on systemd features: glycin only works on Linux due
to its sandbox mechanisms and how it communicates with its loaders.
However, there’s no need to fret this time, and that’s why I’m posting
this item – you just know this tiny little tidbit will find their way
into internet discussion forums and social media as another example of
GNOME not caring about non-Linux users. While some of the sandboxing and
communication features in glycin can be made to work on the BSDs and
perhaps macOS, it won’t be perfect. As such, great care has been taken
to ensure non-Linux platforms can continue to use GdkPixbuf just fine,
since support for other platforms is part of the goals of this change
before traditional loaders are removed. As a general solution for other
platforms, I am planning a mechanism to compile the loaders into the
library. This will not provide sandboxing and format extendability
without recompilation. But since most loaders are written in Rust, this
is still a huge step-up security wise. Contributions for support on
other platforms are welcome. For GdkPixbuf users, this will not pose an
immediate issue since traditional gdk-pixbuf loaders are not going away
until all platforms it supported, are supported by glycin. ↫ Sophie
Herold There are a few other issues, as any change like this tends to
cause, like the list of supported images formats. Glycin supports AVIF,
BMP, DDS, Farbfeld, QOI, GIF, HEIC, ICO, JPEG, JPEG XL, OpenEXR, PNG,
PNM, SVG, TGA, TIFF, and WEBP out of the box, but some of the subformats
within each of these might potentially not work entirely correctly due
to incorrect implementations by, say, camera manufacturers. A special
case here is the TIFF format, which apparently still has a number of
issues and might end up relying on a fallback. Glycin brings a ton of
benefits, such as improved colour support for things like HDR and wider
colour gamut displays, better metadata support, basic image editing
functions out of the box, increased performance, as well as the benefits
inherent in using a memory-safe language like Rust.</p>

user surprised when 1960s computer panel emerged from collapsed family

<p>date: 2025-06-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>Recently, a Reddit user discovered a rare RCA Spectra 70/35 computer
control panel from 1966 in their family’s old collapsed garage, posting
photos of the pre-moon landing mainframe component to the
“retrobattlestations” subreddit that celebrates vintage computers. After
cleaning the panel and fixing most keyswitches, the original poster
noted that actually running it would require “1,500lbs of mainframe”—the
rest of the computer system that’s missing. ↫ Benj Edwards at Ars
Technica Apparently, no photos of this panel existed online, and it may
be one of the few – if only – ‘surviving’ example of such a panel. Of
course, it’s effectively useless without all of the other chunks that
make up the entire Spectra mainframe, but it’s still an interesting
find. The person who found it intends to turn it into what is
essentially a piece of home decor, but maybe we’ll get lucky and someone
else out there who has been collecting parts and pieces to assemble a
working RCA Spectra 70/35 can do something more productive with it.</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Are you still using Windows 7, 8, 8.1, or a 32 bit version of
Windows, relying on LibreOffice for your sexy office tasks of writing
TPS reports and calculating and tabulating juicy, plump numbers? Bad
news: the next version of LibreOffice will remove support for these
platforms. Buried deep in the release notes of the second beta for
LibreOffice 25.8, it reads: Support for Windows 7 and 8/8.1 was removed.
Support for x86 (32-bit) Windows builds is deprecated. ↫ LibreOffice
25.8 beta 2 release notes I honestly doubt many people actually still
rely on LibreOffice on these platforms, and even if for some
unfathomable reason you do, you are probably also okay with sticking
with an older version of LibreOffice to keep your weird setup going a
few years longer. You do you.</p>

<h2 id="an-excuse-to-mention-void-linux-xbps-0.60-released">An excuse to
mention Void Linux: XBPS 0.60 released</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Since Void Linux uses a rolling release model, there’s not much to
report on in the form of new releases and major new features, so I’m
taking the release of version 0.60 of XBPS, Void Linux’ package manager,
to cheat my way into talking about this excellent Linux distribution. I
always think of Void as the “BSD of Linux distributions”, which should
give you some vague hint as to what it’s going for. XBPS 0.60 doesn’t
come packed with major new features either, and mostly fixes a ton of
bugs, addresses few memory leaks, and changes the way held dependencies
and directory removal/creation works when reinstalling a packages, just
to name a few. There’s also some performance improvements, as there were
apparently some problems in that department due to the increasing number
of virtual packages in the Void repository. If you’re looking for a more
traditional, hands-on Linux distribution, Void is an excellent choice.
It’s my back-up for if (let’s face it: when) Fedora messes something
up.</p>
