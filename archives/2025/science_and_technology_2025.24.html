<p>date: 2025-06-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Are you still using Windows 7, 8, 8.1, or a 32 bit version of
Windows, relying on LibreOffice for your sexy office tasks of writing
TPS reports and calculating and tabulating juicy, plump numbers? Bad
news: the next version of LibreOffice will remove support for these
platforms. Buried deep in the release notes of the second beta for
LibreOffice 25.8, it reads: Support for Windows 7 and 8/8.1 was removed.
Support for x86 (32-bit) Windows builds is deprecated. ↫ LibreOffice
25.8 beta 2 release notes I honestly doubt many people actually still
rely on LibreOffice on these platforms, and even if for some
unfathomable reason you do, you are probably also okay with sticking
with an older version of LibreOffice to keep your weird setup going a
few years longer. You do you.</p>

<h2 id="an-excuse-to-mention-void-linux-xbps-0.60-released">An excuse to
mention Void Linux: XBPS 0.60 released</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Since Void Linux uses a rolling release model, there’s not much to
report on in the form of new releases and major new features, so I’m
taking the release of version 0.60 of XBPS, Void Linux’ package manager,
to cheat my way into talking about this excellent Linux distribution. I
always think of Void as the “BSD of Linux distributions”, which should
give you some vague hint as to what it’s going for. XBPS 0.60 doesn’t
come packed with major new features either, and mostly fixes a ton of
bugs, addresses few memory leaks, and changes the way held dependencies
and directory removal/creation works when reinstalling a packages, just
to name a few. There’s also some performance improvements, as there were
apparently some problems in that department due to the increasing number
of virtual packages in the Void repository. If you’re looking for a more
traditional, hands-on Linux distribution, Void is an excellent choice.
It’s my back-up for if (let’s face it: when) Fedora messes something
up.</p>
