<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/07/10/a-25-mph-ambulance-the-gem-microcar-is-now-an-emergency-responder/">GEM
electric low-speed vehicles (LSVs)</a>, just unveiled a brand new lineup
of commercial electric carts and LSVs. And this time, they’re not
messing around when it comes to utility. Dubbed the <em>Fusion</em>
line, these new lithium-ion-powered vehicles include mashups plucked
from the worlds of golf carts, street-legal shuttles, and jobsite pickup
trucks.

Heads up, EV shoppers: A 25% tariff on imported cars is already in
place, and the Republicans killed the $7,500 EV tax credit after
September 30. That means time is running out to score a lease while
there’s still tariff-free inventory on dealer lots – and before that
federal incentive vanishes. If you’ve been thinking about leasing a new
EV, now’s the time to take a serious look. Here are 5 of the best

Stark Future, the Barcelona-based electric motorcycle startup known for
its high-performance off-road bikes, has just smashed expectations by
posting its first profitable quarter – and in record time. After
announcing its
<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/05/14/how-one-of-the-only-profitable-electric-motorcycle-companies-got-there-with-street-legal-e-dirtbikes/">first
profitable month</a> this past April, the company is now sharing that
its Q2 2025 results show €47 million in revenue and €4.5 million in
EBITDA. That would mark the fastest path to profitability ever recorded
for an electric vehicle manufacturer, whether on two wheels or four.

I’ve spent countless hours here at <em>Electrek</em> doing detailed
<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/01/11/radtrike-review-testing-rad-power-bikes-electric-trike/">hands-on
testing</a> of hundreds of electric bikes. Through thousands of miles of
riding, I’ve been fortunate to learn these e-bikes inside and out, top
to bottom and front to back. That long-term experience with real-world
e-bike testing has helped me find the best electric bicycles on the
market for just about any budget.
</p>
<p>
Below are some of the top e-bikes I’ve hand-tested for every price
range, current as of July 2025. Summer is here in full force, making
this a great chance to get a jump on the riding season with a fun and
efficient electric bicycle! So check out the awesome e-bikes below, any
one of which could become your next electric bike.

Back in 2018, when most electric motorcycle startups were showing off
what looked like clunky science experiments or budget-minded e-scooters,
a little company out of Stuttgart quietly unveiled one of the
wildest-looking two-wheelers I’d ever seen. As one of the first
motorcycle journalists
<a href="https://electrek.co/2018/09/28/pocket-rocket-electric-motorcycle/">to
cover Sol Motors</a> and their outlandish debut seven years ago, I’ve
been keeping tabs on them ever since. And now I am excited to share that
the Sol Pocket Rocket is finally preparing to launch in full production
form. Yes, really.

Tesla has expanded the service area of its Robotaxi service in Austin,
and it did so to draw a penis-shaped service map, seemingly for no other
reason than to satisfy the juvenile humor of its CEO, but what it really
achieved is to illustrate how unserious Tesla’s Robotaxi business is
compared to other efforts.
