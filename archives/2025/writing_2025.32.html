When Natalie Messier entered the
<a href="https://www.finaldraft.com/big-break-screenwriting-contest/">Final
Draft Big Break TV writing competition</a> in 2022, she didn’t expect to
win. Her dramedy pilot ‘Killer Queen’, about a woman who discovers her
husband is a serial killer, was a sharp, funny, and oddly tender take on
the delayed coming-of-age trope, but at that point, she says, “I hadn’t
really received much acclaim for anything I’d written.”<br><br>Winning
changed everything for Natalie.<br><br>Though she was already working in
the writers’ room of NBC’s Chicago Fire as an assistant when she found
out she won Big Break’s Grand Prize in the TV Drama category, the
recognition gave her new-found confidence. “I told my coworkers about
the win, and they were like, ‘Congratulations! Can I read it?’ They read
it, and that’s what got me my first episode of television. I probably
wouldn’t have shared it with them if I hadn’t won.”

<em>Freakier Friday</em> is the tale of four women who end up switching
bodies, and must learn what it’s like to walk in someone else’s shoes.
This isn’t an original story. In fact, it’s the sequel to <em>Freaky
Friday</em> (2003), which is a remake of the original <em>Freaky
Friday</em> from 1976, not including the TV movie made in 1995, or the
other TV movie/musical from 2018.

‘Sirens’ Creator/Showrunner Molly Smith Metzler</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-12, from: Final Draft blog</p>

“Our goal in writing [<em>Sirens</em>] was to write something that makes
you think, and offers the opportunity to re-examine your own assumptions
that you made about these characters. And it’s taxing. We ask some
difficult questions. It’s not <em>The Perfect Couple</em>. It’s not a
murder show. We’re going after something thematically that’s really
large and really ambitious, and that’s why the Greek mythology came to
mind. These are epic stories. These are about blood, and moms, and
torture, and trauma, and pain. These themes are not tiny. These are
complicated, juicy stews,” says showrunner and creator, Molly Smith
Metzler about why she wanted to invoke big themes from Greek drama in
her TV show <em>Sirens</em>. 
</p>
<p>
On today’s episode, we chat with Molly Smith Metzler, showrunner and
creator of the hit Netflix limited series <em>Sirens</em> starring
Julianne Moore, Meghann Fahy and Kevin Bacon. The show is based on her
stage play <em>Elemeno Pea</em> from 2011. Smith Metzler talks about
making the transition from playwriting to television and what she
learned about being in the writer’s room for <em>Orange is the New
Black</em>. 
</p>
<p>
“Everything you do in a [writer’s] room is an offering. I’m here to
serve, I’m here to serve you. Come in with ideas, offer them. If they
don’t hit, back off of them. You are a sous chef and a waiter,” she
says. 
</p>
<p>
She also talks about writing edgy female characters unapologetically,
like the ones in <em>Sirens</em>, and the numerous times she was asked
to remove a certain risqué scene from the pilot script – which she
refused to do. “We have to write these women in their truest form –
they’re complicated, and they don’t have to explain themselves, either.
My job is not to soften her so an audience won’t turn off the TV show,”
she says. 
</p>

<em>Mild Spoilers Ahead! </em>Zach Cregger’s movies are wildly unique.
With his breakout film <em>Barbarian</em>, he played with the fears of
anyone staying at an Airbnb realizing that the house is not what it
seems. He has followed up this surprise box office hit with
<em>Weapons</em>, a twisty, creepy psychological horror movie that plays
into every parent’s worst nightmare: their child runs away in the middle
of the night.

If you’re an emerging screenwriter, you’ve likely heard it’s a good idea
to build a brand or grow your online presence. But putting yourself “out
there” can be intimidating, especially if you don’t want to look like a
cringey self-promoter or some kind of screenwriting hack. <br><br>The
good news is that screenwriter Nic Curcio has figured out a path that
feels authentic and engaging and has shared his advice with us. Nic, who
wrote on the upcoming animated feature <em>Goat</em> (in theaters
February 2026), has steadily grown a loyal following on TikTok by
posting screenwriting-related videos that are both educational and
entertaining. What started as a side hobby during the pandemic has
helped him land meetings, earn extra cheddar, and connect with a larger
writing community.<br><br>Before working on <em>Goat</em> and finding a
social media following, Nic studied English at UCLA and later earned his
MFA in Film/TV Production from USC. His studies at USC gave him hands-on
experience in various aspects of filmmaking, but writing is where he
found his strongest voice. <br><br>In 2019, his feature script
<em>Barron: A Tale of Love, Loss and Legacy</em>, was featured on the
annual Black List, a ranking of Hollywood’s best unproduced scripts
(yes, it’s a fictional story about a young Barron Trump!). From there,
he landed a job as an in-house writer at Sony Animation, where he spent
over a year rewriting and shaping <em>Goat</em> while working closely
with the animation team. He has since written projects for Paramount and
Universal, including a feature adaptation of the comic <em>Planet of the
Nerds</em> and a new take on <em>The Magic School Bus</em>. In addition
to all of this, he also finds time to co-host the podcast <em>Hollywood
Hang</em> with fellow screenwriter Kristen Tepper.
