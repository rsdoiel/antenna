<h2 id="the-best-new-video-games-of-2025-so-far">The best new video
games of 2025 so far</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-14, updated: 2025-04-11, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>We’re a few months into 2025 now, and already we’ve played some
all-timers. Several major studios pushed their games from 2024 to 2025,
for one thing — the long-awaited Assassin’s Creed Shadows captured
several of our hearts, as did the surprisingly deep fantasy lore of
Avowed (featuring Garrus voice actor Brandon Keener as a beloved […]</p>

Last of Us’ Stalkers may be even smarter than in the video game</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-14, updated: 2025-04-11, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>The Last of Us seems to introduce a new type of infected — new, at
least, to people who have yet to play developer Naughty Dog’s video
game. It’s early on in The Last of Us season 2 when Ellie and Dina, on
patrol, enter an abandoned grocery store to pick off a couple infected.

<p>date: 2025-04-14, updated: 2025-04-11, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>The Last of Us season 2 has finally arrived, and the first episode
shows a world that’s just as brutal as we remembered it. There’s already
some rageful mourning, power struggles, betrayal, and a new type of
infected for Ellie to contend with, and that’s just in the first hour.
But episode 1 also has […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-13, updated: 2025-04-11, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>If there’s something gamers love in the fantasy genre, it’s when
ancient beings are sealed inside cool swords, from which they can only
whisper and beguile mortal beings. League of Legends takes this concept
even further with the Darkin by creating a whole arsenal of evil weapons
containing ancient evils.  The Darkin had a rough […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-13, updated: 2025-04-11, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Autonomous sensory meridian response, or ASMR, is a sensation where
visual or auditory triggers fire off synapses in the brain that create a
pleasant, calming feeling — colloquially referred to as “tingles.” The
concept has made for a massive industry of content creators on YouTube
and TikTok, all dedicated to helping viewers fall asleep, avoid […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-13, updated: 2025-04-11, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Andor, the best Star Wars show to date, is set to return for its
second and final season on April 22. A lot of people are excited about
it, not the least of which being Andor showrunner Tony Gilroy, who has
gone so far as to describe it as “the most important thing [he’ll] ever

<p>date: 2025-04-13, updated: 2025-04-11, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Hollywood has finally cracked the code on making movies based on
video games, at least from a box-office perspective. The Super Mario
Bros. Movie, the Sonic the Hedgehog trilogy, and A Minecraft Movie have
grossed billions combined since 2020. Whether they’re good movies is up
for debate. Critically, TV seems to be where game adaptations […]</p>
