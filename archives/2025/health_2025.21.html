budget rule</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-30, from: People’s CDC</p>
<p>The important business of the New York State budget was delayed in
part by Gov. Hochul’s stalwart insistence on burdening New Yorkers’
ability to protect themselves from environmental hazards and airborne
pathogens. Since the Governor first requested an anti-mask policy in the
state budget in mid-March, the People’s CDC has joined activists across
New York State calling out the harms such policies present to public
health.</p>

peptides for specific targeting of Leishmania major and Trypanosoma
cruzi parasites</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionLeishmaniasis and Chagas disease are major human
neglected diseases, affecting an estimate of 12 and 6 to 8 million
people worldwide, respectively. Current treatments for both diseases are
highly toxic for the vertebrate host and lack specificity for the
parasites, highlighting the need for the discovery of new therapies
against these diseases. In this study, we tested the use of the lytic
peptide Hecate and a Ligand-Hecate construct that incorporates a ligand
to bind the lytic peptide to protozoa membranes and screened them for
protozoacidal activity.MethodsWe first screened parasite survival of
luciferase expressing Leishmania major promastigotes and Trypanosoma
cruzi epimastigotes in the presence of Hecate or Ligand-Hecate, and
after 12, 48 and 96 h by measuring the parasite luciferase activity. In
addition, High-Content Imaging Assay was used to evaluate the
proliferation of intracellular L. major amastigotes propagated inside
murine macrophages after treatment with Hecate or
Ligand-Hecate.ResultsThe lowest half maximal effective concentration
observed after 48 h of incubation with Hecate and Ligand-Hecate was
lower against L. major promastigotes than T. cruzi epimastigotes.
Ligand-Hecate treatment significantly reduced infection rate of
macrophages L. major amastigotes compared to the non-treated vehicle
control; while treatment with Hecate was significant only at higher drug
concentrations. Importantly, no significant cytotoxicity was observed
when screened against intraperitoneal murine macrophages for either
Hecate or Ligand-Hecate treatments.DiscussionOur results indicate that
ligand-lytic peptide complexes are potential targets for therapeutic
drugs that can selectively kill both extracellular and intracellular
protozoa parasites stages with no significant toxicity to host
cells.</p>

m6A modification regulates mRNA stability of Immediate early response
gene 3 to modulate cell death in Staphylococcus aureus-induced bovine
mastitis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundStaphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)-induced bovine mastitis
is a major challenge for dairy production, causing significant economic
losses. The regulatory mechanisms underlying host cell apoptosis and
inflammation during S. aureus infection remain unclear. Therefore, this
study investigates the role of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification and
its reader protein YTHDF2 in regulating mRNA stability, apoptosis, and
inflammation in bovine mammary epithelial cells (Mac-T cells) under S.
aureus challenge.MethodsMeRIP-seq, RIP-seq, and RT-qPCR were used to
analyze m6A-modified IER3 mRNA and its interaction with YTHDF2.
Apoptosis, necrosis, and mitochondrial function were assessed using
YO-PRO-1/PI staining and JC-1 assays.ResultsS. aureus infection
significantly downregulated YTHDF2 expression in Mac-T cells, leading to
destabilization of m6A-modified IER3 mRNA. This resulted in increased
reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, mitochondrial dysfunction, and
cell apoptosis. Overexpression of YTHDF2 restored mRNA stability,
reduced apoptosis, and preserved mitochondrial function.ConclusionYTHDF2
regulates m6A-modified mRNA stability to modulate apoptosis and
inflammation during S. aureus infection. These findings provide new
insights into understanding the molecular mechanisms of bovine mastitis
and provide genetic markers for breeding mastitis-resistant dairy
cows.</p>

quadruplex TaqMan MGB fluorescent quantitative PCR method for
simultaneous detection of feline panleukopenia virus, feline herpesvirus
1, feline calicivirus and feline infectious peritonitis virus</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundFeline panleukopenia, feline calicivirus infection, feline
viral rhinotracheitis, and feline infectious peritonitis are significant
diseases that threaten feline health. The trend of mixed infections is
increasing, and current diagnostic methods are limited in scope and
unable to provide rapid, simultaneous detection of these
diseases.MethodsFour groups of primers and probes targeting the VP2 gene
of Feline Panleukopenia virus (FPV), the TK gene of Feline Herpesvirus
(FHV-1), the ORF2 gene of Feline Calicivirus (FCV), and the N gene of
Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus (FIPV) were designed. After
optimizing the concentrations of primers and probes and annealing
temperature, a quadruplex TaqMan MGB fluorescent quantitative PCR method
was established to concurrently detect these four pathogens. Recombinant
plasmid standards were constructed to establish standard curves, and the
sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility, and clinical application of
the assay were evaluated.ResultsThe optimal final concentrations of
primers for FPV, FHV-1, FCV, and FIPV were 0.08, 0.04, 0.06, and 0.12
μM, respectively, and the optimal final concentrations of probes were
0.08, 0.08, 0.12, and 0.12 μM, respectively. The best annealing
temperature was 59°C. No cross-reaction was observed with common
pathogens in infected cats. The minimal detection limits for recombinant
plasmids of T-VP2, T-TK, T-ORF2, and T-N were 50.79, 53.21, 47.91 and
41.25 copies/μL, respectively. The R² values of standard curves are
0.994, 1.0, 0.998 and 0.999, respectively, and high amplification
efficiencies of 105.05%, 96.28%, 98.82%, and 96.45%, respectively. The
coefficient of variation for inter-batch and intra-batch tests ranged
from 0.14 to 1.37%. Among 381 fecal samples from cats, the detection
rates for FPV, FHV-1, FCV, and FIPV were 13.65% (52/381), 18.37%
(70/381), 26.77% (102/381), and 9.71% (37/381), respectively, with a
100% agreement with previously reported methods and commercial
kits.ConclusionThe sensitive, specific, high-throughput, quadruplex
TaqMan MGB quantitative fluorescent quantitative PCR method was
successfully established for the simultaneous detection of FPV, FHV-1,
FCV, and FIPV.</p>

id="fimc-binds-to-the-promoter-region-of-agn43-to-modulate-autoaggregation">FimC
binds to the promoter region of agn43 to modulate autoaggregation</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundAvian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) infection causes
high mortality in chicks and leads to significant economic losses in the
poultry industry. During the initial infection, APEC colonizes host
cells using type 1 fimbriae and subsequently forms biofilms, resulting
in persistent and chronic infections. fimC is a chaperone protein
associated with type 1 fimbriae and plays a crucial role in the assembly
of fimbriae. However, its regulatory role in agn43-mediated
autoaggregation remains unclear.MethodsBy constructing fimC gene mutant
strains, the autoaggregation, motility, biofilm formation, and the
adhesion and invasion ability to HD-11 cells were examined. The
transcriptome and the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) were
used to screen and verify the regulation of fimC on downstream
genes.ResultsThe results demonstrated that the lack of fimC, but not
fimbriae, significantly increased autoaggregation (p &lt; 0.001) while
promoting the transcription of agn43 (p &lt; 0.01). Transcriptomic
analysis showed that the deletion of fimC caused significant changes in
the gene transcription levels in a variety of pathways, such as
flagellar synthesis, biofilm formation, quorum sensing, and
bis-(3′-5′)-cyclic diguanylic acid (c-di-GMP) metabolism. Further
investigation revealed that fimC directly interacted with the promoter
region of agn43 and inhibited its transcription. In addition, both fimC
and agn43 had regulatory effects on biofilm formation, motility,
adhesion, and invasion.ConclusionThis study demonstrated that fimC acts
as an atypical DNA-binding protein to regulate the transcription of
agn43. It also highlights the importance of fimC in the biofilm
formation and adhesion ability of APEC, which provides new insights into
the functions of the fimbrial chaperone protein FimC.</p>

of overlapping fungal infection on the occurrence and prognosis of
carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacilli infection</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe global threat of carbapenem-resistant gram-negative
bacteria (CRGNB) infection is compounded by concurrent fungal
infections, which present additional clinical challenges. This study
aims to elucidate the impact of fungal infection on the occurrence and
prognosis of CRGNB infection.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective,
single-center, observational cohort study of 2,273 patients with CRGNB
and/or fungal infection from January 2018 to April 2023. Binary logistic
regression analysis and multivariable Cox proportional hazards
regression model were used to determine risk factors for the occurrence
and prognosis of patients with CRGNB or fungal infections. Survival
analysis was performed to investigate the impact of fungal co-infection
on mortality of total GRGNB and bacterial subclasses
infections.ResultsFungal infection was a independent risk factor for
CRGNB infection (OR=1.381, p=0.015), and similarly, GRGNB was associated
with an increased risk of fungal infection (OR=1.542, p&lt;0.001).
Besides, males and individuals with a history of ICU admissions,
invasive surgeries, malignancies, mechanical ventilation, drainage
tubes, or exposure to cephalosporin/carbapenem antibiotics were found to
be more susceptible to both types of infections. Compared to patients
with only GRGNB infection, co-infections contributed to a higher risk of
mortality. However, co-infections do not amplify mortality risk in
patients with only fungal infection. Further analysis revealed a
significant increase in mortality of patients with carbapenem-resistant
Klebsiella pneumoniae or carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii
co-infections, but no change in mortality rates was observed with
carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli or carbapenem-resistant
Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Interestingly, we found that fungi were detected
significantly earlier than CRGNB (median: 9 days vs. 21 days,
p&lt;0.001).ConclusionsIn the current study, it was discovered that
fungal infections preceded GRGNB infections and might contribute to the
development of antibiotic resistance in some gram-negative bacteria,
which ultimately leads to more severe clinical outcomes.</p>

spp. and Aspergillus flavus infection induces pathogen-specific and
pathogen-independent host immune response in patients with fungal
keratitis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionFungal keratitis, caused primarily by Fusarium spp. and
Aspergillus flavus, is a significant cause of corneal blindness,
particularly in tropical regions. Current antifungal agents like
natamycin and voriconazole have limited efficacy, underscoring the need
for a deeper understanding of host immune responses.MethodsThis study
employed high-throughput RNA sequencing to investigate differential gene
expression in human corneal tissues from patients with Fusarium spp. and
A. flavus keratitis and compared them to control cadaver corneal
samples. RNA was extracted from infected and control samples, followed
by sequencing and differential expression analysis. Further confirmation
of differential expression of selected genes were carried out by
Real-Time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). ResultsData analysis identified
common and Fusarium spp. and A. flavus-specific differentially expressed
genes (DEGs). Pathway enrichment analysis using common genes identified
pathways enriched in both infections, such as interleukin 17 (IL-17),
tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and chemokine signalling. Expression of hub
genes, including S100 calcium binding protein A7 (S100A7), S100 calcium
binding protein A8 (S100A8), S100 calcium binding protein A9 (S100A9)
and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8), identified in interleukin 17
(IL-17) signalling, was confirmed by RT-qPCR analysis. Fusarium
spp.-specific DEGs, including complement C3 (C3), interleukin 6 (IL-6),
interleukin 19 (IL-19) and leucine rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 (LRG1),
are enriched in pathways such as positive regulation of immune
responses, acute inflammatory responses, leukocyte cell-cell adhesion,
and the regulation of cell-cell adhesion. A. flavus-specific DEGs, such
as triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and
apolipoprotein E (APOE), are predominantly enriched in adaptive immune
response, negative regulation of immune system process, negative
regulation of immune response, cell migration and motility
pathways.DiscussionRT-qPCR confirmed the key pathogen-specific DEGs,
highlighting their potential as biomarkers for pathogen-specific immune
responses. These findings provide insights into the distinct immune
pathways triggered by Fusarium spp. and A. flavus, offering new
therapeutic targets for improving fungal keratitis treatment.</p>

bacterial immunity: CRISPR-Cas system as a versatile tool in combating
pathogens and revolutionizing medicine</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)
technology has emerged as an adaptable instrument for several uses. The
CRISPR–Cas system employs Cas proteins and programmable RNA molecules to
guide the recognition and cleavage of specific DNA regions, permitting
accurate genome editing. It is derived from the bacterial immune system
and allows for accurate and efficient modification of DNA sequences.
This technique provides unparalleled gene editing, control, and precise
alteration opportunities. This review aims to offer a comprehensive
update of the core concepts of the CRISPR–Cas system and recent
progress, while also providing an overview of the significant
applications in diverse fields such as microbiology and medicine. The
CRISPR–Cas9 gene editing technique has facilitated substantial
advancements in comprehending gene function, simulating diseases, and
creating innovative therapeutics. CRISPR-based therapeutics present a
hopeful prospect for addressing intricate ailments, including genetic
disorders, malignancies, and infectious diseases, as they serve as
viable substitutes for conventional pharmaceuticals. In microbiology,
this method serves as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool that proves
highly efficient in eliminating bacteria that have developed resistance
to various antibiotics. Despite its significant potential, CRISPR
encounters ethical, safety, and regulatory obstacles that necessitate
meticulous deliberation. Concerns regarding off-target effects, poor
delivery to target tissues, and unwanted side effects emphasize the
necessity to thoroughly examine the technology. It is necessary to
balance the advantages and difficulties CRISPR presents. Consequently,
more rigorous preclinical and clinical experiments are essential before
using it in humans.</p>

colonization of the pancreatic tumor affects postoperative complications
and outcome after pancreatic surgery</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe patient´s microbiome has become a focal point in cancer
research. Even for pancreatic cancer, alterations in the microbiome
appear to influence cancer formation and progression. The aim of our
single-center analysis was the examination of microbiological
colonization of pancreas tissue at the time of surgery and its potential
influence on complications and outcome.MethodsWe prospectively evaluated
patients undergoing pancreatic surgery over a three-year period from
June 2018 to June 2021. We focused on the microbiological colonization
of pancreatic tissue which was acquired during pancreatic surgery.
Tissue samples were cultivated at our institute of microbiology.
Patients´ characteristics, complications and postoperative outcome were
analyzed using a prospectively maintained SPSS database.ResultsBetween
June 2018 and June 2021, we collected pancreatic tissue samples of a
total of 178 patients undergoing pancreas resections, mostly due to
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC; 50.6%). We could cultivate bacterial or
fungal species in pancreatic tissue samples of 50 of our patients
(28.1%). The majority of cases were characterized by the presence of a
single microbial species, but 20 patients (11.2%) showed colonization
with up to four different species. Among the bacterial species detected
were Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli,
Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumonia. We
found significantly more microbiological culture growth in patients with
a preoperative biliary stent (74.0% vs. 15.6%, p &lt; 0.001). Concerning
postoperative complications, we found no difference concerning
pancreatic fistula, but colonization with E. coli was associated with a
significantly higher rate of postpancreatectomy hemorrhage (30.0%
vs. 8.9%, p = 0.032). Interestingly, survival of PDAC patients seems to
be negatively affected by positive microbiological findings at the time
of surgery, but without reaching statistical significance (p =
0.770).ConclusionIn this first analysis of our patient cohort, we could
show a microbiological colonization of pancreatic tumor tissue in almost
a third of our patients. There seems to be only a minor impact on
postoperative complications, but long-term outcome seems to be worse in
patients with a positive pancreas microbiome. Further observation is
needed to evaluate the influence of the tumor microbiome on the
long-term oncological outcome in PDAC patients.</p>

pathologic conditions and impaired cytokine response in patients with
previous cerebral abscess or cervical necrotizing soft tissue
infection</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundMicroorganisms involved in cerebral abscess (CA) and
cervical necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI) are frequently
commensals of the oral cavity. Yet, the reasons for their ability to
cause severe opportunistic infections remains unknown. The purpose of
this study was to evaluate the dental characteristics and examine the
stimulated immune response in patients with a history of CA or cervical
NSTI.MethodsThis observational study includes a clinical dental
examination, and the collection of blood samples from 18 previous CA
patients and four previous cervical NSTI patients. Whole blood cells
were stimulated with LPS, R848, Poly I:C and anti-CD3/-CD28 beads in
TruCulture tubes. The concentrations of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10,
IL-12, IL-17A, IFN-α, and IFN-γ were subsequently measured by Luminex
technology and compared with corresponding values from a healthy
reference group. P-values of ≤ 0.001 were considered statistically
significant.ResultsFor patients with previous CA, decreased production
of IFN-α, IFN-γ, and IL-12 was seen after stimulation of cells with LPS
and Poly I:C (p ≤ 0.001). Moreover, cells from patients with previous
cervical NSTI showed decreased production of IFN-α and IFN-γ after
stimulation with LPS and Poly I:C (p ≤ 0.001). Nineteen out of 22
participants (86%) had oral pathologic conditions at the dental
examination.ConclusionThe cytokine secretion for the LPS- and Poly
I:C-stimulus suggests an impaired proinflammatory response within the
innate immune response against bacterial and viral pathogens. A high
prevalence of oral pathologic conditions was found at the clinical
dental examinations. However, none of the patients experienced
recurrence of CA or NSTI.</p>

characteristics, risk factors and prognosis of Klebsiella pneumoniae
infection in patients with different states of immune function: a
retrospective study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe aim of our study was to investigate the epidemiology
and risk factors of Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) infection in
immunocompromised patients and to compare the differences in prognosis
among patients with different immune states in the extended-spectrum
beta-lactamase KP (ESBL-KP), the carbapenem-resistant KP (CRKP), and the
non-multidrug-resistant KP (non-MDR-KP) groups.MethodsWe conducted a
retrospective study in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients
with KP infections who were admitted to Chaohu Hospital of Anhui Medical
University from January 2023 to December 2023. We compared demographics,
clinical characteristics, treatments, and outcomes across these groups
and examined the impact of ESBL-KP, CRKP and non-MDR-KP on cumulative
survival rates in populations with different immune states by plotting
Kaplan-Meier curves.ResultsOur study included 228 immunocompromised
patients and 200 immunocompetent patients. Compared to the
immunocompetent group, immunocompromised patients were more likely to
have a history of surgery and to use hormone frequently. They tended to
rely more on medical devices, including urinary catheters, nasogastric
catheters, arterial catheters, venous catheters, mechanical ventilation
and endoscopy. Immunocompromised patients had a poorer recovery and were
rehospitalized more often than those in immunocompetent patients. In the
multivariable analysis, age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index (aCCI)
(OR: 1.292, 95%CI: 1.086-1.537, P &lt; 0.004) and microbiological
clearance failure (OR: 4.175, 95%CI: 1.966-8.866, P &lt; 0.001) were the
most important risk factors for mortality in immunocompromised patients
infected with KP. It was further observed that immunocompromised
patients in the ESBL-KP group had the lowest cumulative survival. In
contrast, among both all participants and immunocompetent patients, the
CRKP group had the lowest cumulative survival, followed by the ESBL-KP
group.ConclusionThe clinical characteristics, treatment process and
prognosis in immunocompromised patients with KP infections are
significantly different from those in immunocompetent patients. In
clinical settings, the standardization of invasive procedures and the
rational use of antibiotics represent the most effective strategies for
preventing and treating KP infection.</p>

in gut microbiota accompanied by increased intestinal permeability and
Tfh/Tfr imbalance in patients with active SLE</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundIncreased intestinal permeability and altered intestinal
microbiota may influence cytokine regulatory immunity in systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE). This study aimed to elucidate the relationship
between intestinal flora alters and follicular helper T cells (Tfh),
regulatory T cells (Treg) cells, and cytokines in SLE.MethodsIn total,
23 patients with active SLE (SLE-A group), 18 patients with stable SLE
(SLE-nA group), and 24 healthy controls (HC group) were enrolled. Tfh,
follicular T regulatory (Tfr), and Treg cells were measured by flow
cytometry, and fecal samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene
sequencing. The relationship between the gut microbiome and the SLE
disease activity index (SLEDAI-2k), zonulin (an indicator of intestinal
permeability), IL-2, IL-6, and IL-21 levels was
analyzed.ResultsDecreased Treg cells and imbalanced Tfh/Tfr were
associated with elevated disease activity in SLE-A group. The increase
in zonulin levels in SLE-A group indicated worsened intestinal mucosal
barrier damage, potentially linked with the increase in the dominant
microflora Escherichia-Shigella. Furthermore, the increase in zonulin
was correlated with a severe imbalance in Tfh/Tfr. Moreover, decreased
IL-2 levels were associated with a decrease in Ruminococcus and may
modulate the reduction in Treg cells during disease progression. Zonulin
also exhibited a negative correlation with IL-2.ConclusionZonulin may be
involved in the Tfh/Tfr immune imbalance in patients with SLE, and
Faecalibacterium and Ruminococcus may contribute to disease development
by regulating Treg cells and Tfh/Tfr imbalance. Taken together, these
findings may provide new insights into the role of cytokines in the
treatment of SLE.</p>

subpopulations in Escherichia coli strains acquire adaptive resistance
to imipenem treatment through rapid transcriptional regulation</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-30, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionHeteroresistance is a well-known phenomenon contributing
to treatment failure in bacterial infections. Previous research has
traditionally linked it to genetic mechanisms, emphasizing fixed
subpopulations with specific resistance mutations. Recent studies
appreciated that bacterial subpopulations may not be fixed and
independent, but rather dynamically changing. Heteroresistance
mechanisms are likely more intricate than mere genetic predisposition
alone.MethodsOur study investigated the role of non-genetically encoded
mechanisms in early stages of occurrence and development of
heteroresistance through transcriptome analysis and molecular biology
experiments.ResultsWe identified a clinical Escherichia coli strain
that, despite no prior antibiotic treatment, still exhibited imipenem
heteroresistance. We found that these heteroresistance populations can
rapidly acquire adaptive capability for imipenem-resistance through an
active and dynamic gene regulatory process. At their highly resistant
stage, the transcriptome is primarily characterized by enhanced
expression of related genes in exopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan
biosynthesis (wcaE, wcaF, mrcB, murA, etc), leading to critical
alterations in bacterial intracellular and intercellular structure,
including maintaining the integrity of the outer cell membrane and the
promotion of biofilm formation. Conversely, in antibiotics-free
conditions, these highly imipenem-resistant subpopulations can revert to
an imipenem-sensitive state, accompanied by reversed gene expression.
Additionally, we discovered that extremely low-level antibiotic exposure
can regenerate heteroresistance populations, accompanied by similar
pattern of gene expression.DiscussionOverall, our study revealed
non-genetic mechanisms that enable bacterial strains to acquire adaptive
imipenem-resistance rapidly. Moreover, preventing hospital-acquired
infections should focus not only on eliminating residual bacteria but
also on removing residual antibiotics in clinical settings.</p>

of uremic bacterial metabolites in patients with post-COVID-19
syndrome</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is characterized by persistent symptoms
and reduced mental and physical performance following the acute phase of
COVID-19. The underlying mechanisms remain unclear but may involve gut
microbiota dysbiosis and immune-related changes in amino acid
metabolism. This pilot study aimed to investigate whether specific
bacterial uremic metabolites (BUM) are altered in patients with
post-infectious syndromes and whether these alterations are associated
with PCS symptoms. We examined BUM in 25 PCS patients, 8 Myalgic
Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) patients, and 8
healthy controls (Ctrls). Concentrations of BUM were determined in
second morning urine samples using mass spectrometry (Biovis Diagnostik,
Limburg, Germany). Standardized questionnaires assesed physical,
cognitive, psychological, and somatic symptoms and mental health status.
PCS and ME/CFS patients exhibited significantly higher scores for
post-exertional malaise (PEM) and somatic symptom severity compared to
healthy controls (p&lt;0.001). Elevated BUM concentrations were found in
64% of PCS patients, compared to 37.5% of both healthy controls and
ME/CFS patients. While overall BUM levels did not significantly differ
between groups, heatmap clustering revealed distinct metabolic patterns.
Elevated tryptamine and 4-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid (HPHPA) and higher
hippuric acid and trimethylamine concentrations, were exclusively
analysed in patients with post-infectious syndromes. Our pilot study
suggests that urine metabolomic analysis may be a useful approach for
investigating the role of gut dysbiosis and BUM in patients with
PCS.</p>

<p>date: 2025-05-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>AimHelicobacter pylori (HP) infection may cause many disorders
outside the digestive system, although research on the association
between HP infection and muscular atrophy among males is limited. This
study aimed to examine the influence of HP infection on adult Chinese
males’ body muscle mass using a cross-sectional and cohort
analysis.MethodsA total of 8110 Chinese adult males were enrolled in the
study. HP infection was assessed using the C13 breath test. Using
bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), body muscle mass was detected
and total muscle mass, total skeletal muscle mass, and appendicular
skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI) were recorded. Univariate and
multivariate linear regression analyses were conducted to identify the
factors associated with body muscle mass.ResultsSubjects with HP
infection had a lower total muscle mass, total skeletal muscle mass, and
ASMI compared with those without HP infection (P &lt; 0.01). Univariate
and multivariate linear regression analyses demonstrated that HP
infection was an independent risk factor of total muscle mass, total
skeletal muscle mass, and ASMI (P &lt; 0.01); this association persisted
when subjects were divided into young, middle-aged, and elderly
according to age (P &lt; 0.01). A subsequent cohort study confirmed that
persistent HP infection accelerated the pathological process of muscle
decline (P &lt; 0.01).ConclusionHP infection is an independent risk
factor for muscle decline in adult Chinese males, long-term HP infection
may accelerate this pathological progression.</p>

efficacy of non-pharmacological treatment of functional constipation: a
systematic review and network meta-analysis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe purpose of this study is to compare the relative
effectiveness and safety of non-pharmacological interventions for the
treatment of functional constipation (FC).MethodsWe searched Pubmed,
Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases for randomized controlled
trials published from 2010 to November 2024. The quality of the included
studies was evaluated using the Cochrane bias risk tool and Review
Manager 5.4, and the evidence was graded using GRADEPro. A network
meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted using R Studio, and the surface under
the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was used to rank the included drugs
for each outcome measure to compare the clinical efficacy of different
treatment methods for chronic functional constipation.ResultsA total of
29 RCT studies were included, with a total of 4389 patients with
functional constipation who were randomly assigned to receive placebo or
one of the nine different non-pharmacological treatment methods. The
assessment of bias risk showed that the bias risk of most included
studies was low. The results showed that the first-ranked treatment
method for clinical efficacy was acupuncture; the first-ranked treatment
method for changes in spontaneous bowel movement (SBM) and complete
spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM) was fecal microbiota transplantation
(FMT); the first-ranked treatment method for changes in the Bristol
Stool Form Scale (BSFS) score was FMT; the first-ranked treatment method
for changes in the Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life
(PAC-QOL) score after treatment was the Vibration capsule; the
first-ranked treatment method for changes in the Patient Assessment of
Constipation Symptoms (PAC-SYM) score after treatment was percutaneous
electrical stimulation; and the treatment method with the lowest
incidence of adverse reactions was probiotics.ConclusionBased on the
SUCRA values and NMA results, we found that FMT showed better effects
and higher safety on BSFS scores, SBM, and CSBM. In addition,
acupuncture showed a good clinical efficacy. We hypothesize that the
combination of FMT and acupuncture may be an effective and safe
treatment option for functional constipation, but further high-quality
clinical studies are needed to confirm this.Systematic review

nucleic acid detection of Clostridioides difficile utilizing the
PAM-unconventional, one-step LAMP/CRISPR-Cas12b detection platforms</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionClostridioides difficile (C. difficile), a human pathogen
that causes diarrhea and colon lesions, has garnered widespread
attention. Rapid and accurate detection of bacterial virulence factors
is essential for the diagnosis of C. difficile infection (CDI). To date,
numerous laboratory tests have been developed; however, none fully meet
the combined requirements of speed, cost-effectiveness, portability,
sensitivity, and specificity. Molecular diagnostic technologies based on
CRISPR-Cas systems have provided a promising solution to this challenge.
Nonetheless, the limited compatibility between pre-amplification and
CRISPR cleavage, coupled with the inherent selectivity of CRISPR systems
for protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences near the target site,
poses additional constraints on the broader adoption of this
approach.MethodsHere, we developed PAM-unconventional, One-step
LAMP/CRISPR-Cas12b (POLC) detection platforms for the toxin-encoding
genes tcdA and tcdB of C. difficile.ResultsThe POLC platforms operated
at 60 °C, enabling result interpretation either through fluorescence
intensity measurements or direct visualization under UV light. The
limits of detection (LoDs) ranged from 3 to 14 copies/μL using a
fluorescence reader and from 6 to 18 copies/μL via direct observation.
Compared to qPCR, which typically requires over an hour, the POLC
platforms reduced the detection time to approximately 40 minutes. Each
reaction cost approximately USD 6.5, offering a substantial cost saving
compared to qPCR-based commercial kits (over USD 10 per test). In
clinical validation with 55 fecal samples, the tcdA POLC assay achieved
86.4% sensitivity and 84.8% specificity, while the tcdB POLC assay
demonstrated 96.6% sensitivity and 100% specificity, using qPCR as the
reference standard.DiscussionOur research presents innovative
CRISPR-based one-step nucleic acid detection platforms that eliminate
canonical PAM sequence requirements. These platforms exhibit high
sensitivity and specificity while achieving rapid detection under simple
conditions, making them promising candidates for clinical diagnostics
and point-of-care testing (POCT).</p>

as regulators of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in herpes simplex virus
type 2 infection</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionHerpes Simplex Virus Type 2 is a prevalent sexually
transmitted pathogen that causes genital herpes and severe neurological
complications, including meningitis and encephalitis. A major challenge
in HSV-2 infection is the uncontrolled inflammatory response mediated by
NLRP3 inflammasome activation, leading to pyroptosis and excessive
cytokine secretion. Despite its significant clinical burden, the
molecular mechanisms underlying HSV-2-induced inflammation remain poorly
understood. Recent evidence suggests that microRNAs play a crucial role
in regulating host immune responses and inflammasome activation. In this
study, we investigate the regulatory role of miR-141 and miR-211 in
modulating inflammasome activation and viral replication during HSV-2
infection.MethodsTHP-1-derived macrophages were transfected with miR-141
or miR-211 mimics or scrambled controls before infection with HSV-2.
Quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis were performed to assess the
expression of NLRP3, CASP1, IL-1β, IL-18, and GSDM-D. Luciferase
reporter assays were conducted to validate miRNA–target interactions,
and ELISA was used to quantify cytokine levels in culture
supernatants.ResultsOur results demonstrate that HSV-2 infection
significantly downregulates miR-141 and miR-211, leading to enhanced
NLRP3 inflammasome activation, increased caspase-1 cleavage, and
excessive secretion of IL-1β and IL-18, ultimately causing pyroptotic
cell death. Transfection with miR-141 and miR-211 mimics restored miRNA
expression, resulting in a marked suppression of inflammasome activation
and inflammatory cytokine release, as well as significant inhibition of
HSV-2 viral gene expression. Luciferase assays confirmed that miR-141
directly targets NLRP3, while miR-211 regulates CASP1, validating their
roles as post-transcriptional repressors of inflammasome
components.DiscussionThese findings establish miR-141 and miR-211 as
critical modulators of HSV-2-induced inflammasome activation,
highlighting a novel miRNA-based regulatory mechanism. Restoring these
miRNAs significantly reduces viral replication and inflammation,
underscoring their potential as therapeutic targets for managing
HSV-2-induced immunopathology. Future research should focus on in vivo
validation and therapeutic optimization to develop miRNA-based
interventions.</p>

the gut-heart potential connection: microbiota’s role in kawasaki
disease and coronary artery lesions</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundKawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic immune
vasculitis predominantly affecting medium and small arteries, commonly
observed in pediatric patients. It represents the most common form of
acquired heart disease in this population. Emerging evidence suggests
that gut microbiota can modulate the gut-vascular axis, influencing
coronary artery lesions (CALs). This study aims to elucidate the
potential association between gut microbiota, KD, and CALs, as well as
identify bacterial biomarkers for CALs.MethodsWe analyzed the gut
microbiota composition of 60 children with KD (15 in the acute phase, 45
in the nonacute phase) and 30 healthy controls using alpha diversity
indices and t-tests. Microbial biomarkers were identified through LEfSe
to analyze the interplay between gut microbiota and CALs in KD during
acute and non-acute phases.ResultsIn the acute phase, KD children
exhibited decreased richness and diversity of gut microbiota,
characterized by dysbiosis, particularly a reduction in short-chain
fatty acid-producing bacteria and overgrowth of opportunistic pathogens.
Thirteen genera showed statistically significant changes, including
Enterococcus, Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Agathobacter,
Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Roseburia, Monoglobus, etc. LEfSe
analysis revealed enrichment of
Burkholderia-Caballeronia-Paraburkholderia, Hungatella, and
Clostridium_innocuum group in patients with concurrent CALs, while
Halomonas was depleted. In the nonacute phase, gut microbiota diversity
was similar to healthy controls, but Streptococcus was upregulated,
while Eubacterium_eligens_group and Erysipelotrichaceae_UCG_003 were
downregulated. CALs were associated with reduced Anaerostipes,
Subdoligranulum, Roseburia, and Lachnospira. LEfSe analysis also showed
enrichment of Coprobacillus, Paludicola, Lautropia, UCG-009,
Acetanaerobacterium, Methylobacterium-Methylorubrum, and Alistipes in
patients with CALs.ConclusionsOur findings provide evidence of gut
microbiota dysbiosis in KD children, suggesting its involvement in CALs
development. It indicates that under the premise of standardized
treatment during the acute phase of KD, it is plausible that
microbiota-targeted strategies may alleviate CALs, thereby improving
patient prognosis.</p>

<p>date: 2025-05-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) poses a
serious threat to the public health system due to its multi-drug
resistance and strong biofilm-forming ability. Here, we explored the
possible inhibitory mechanism of an antimicrobial peptide, Mastoparan X,
against MRSAMethodsMinimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum
Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) of Mastoparan X against MRSA USA300
were determined by microbroth dilution method. The antibacterial
activity of Mastoparan X against USA300 was then evaluated by
time-growth curves, membrane fluidity, reactive oxygen species(ROS),
flow cytometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser
scanning microscopy (CLSM). In addition, the inhibitory and scavenging
effects of Mastoparan X on USA300 biofilm were evaluated using crystal
violet staining. Finally, gene expression changes in USA300 after
treatment with Mastoparan X were analyzed by transcriptomics and
verified by RT-qPCR.ResultsThe MIC and MBC of Mastoparan X on USA300
were 32 μg/mL and 64 μg/mL, respectively. SEM observation showed
significant changes in cell morphology after Mastoparan X treatment.
Flow cytometry confirmed that Mastoparan X promoted the apoptosis of
MRSA cells. In addition, Mastoparan X inhibited the formation of MRSA
biofilm while destroying the mature bioepithelia already formed.
Transcriptomic analysis showed that 851 genes were significantly altered
and ABC transport protein, amino acid biosynthesis, glycolysis and
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were inhibited after 16μg/mL Mastoparan X
treatment.ConclusionOur study demonstrated that Mastoparan X has potent
bactericidal activity against MRSA and is expected to provide new
potential peptides for the clinical treatment of MRSA.</p>

of the salivary microbiome in healthy individuals under fatigue
status</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-29, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Background &amp; AimsLimited understanding exists regarding the
characteristics and biological significance of the salivary microbiome
in healthy individuals experiencing physiological fatigue. This study
aimed to delineate the structural and functional alterations in the
salivary microbiome of healthy individuals undergoing physiological
fatigue compared to energetic controls, and to explore its potential as
a biomarker for fatigue status.MethodsA cohort of 7 healthy individuals
experiencing acute physiological fatigue (induced by prolonged study and
confirmed via electroencephalography; Fatigue group, FTG) and 63
energetic healthy controls (Energetic group, ENG) were enrolled. Saliva
samples were collected, from which microbial DNA was extracted. The
V3–V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene was subsequently
sequenced using high-throughput technology. Bioinformatics analyses
encompassed assessment of alpha and beta diversity, identification of
differential taxa using Linear discriminant analysis Effect Size (LEfSe)
with multi-method cross-validation, construction of microbial
co-occurrence networks, and screening of fatigue-associated biomarker
genera via the Boruta-SHAP algorithm. Microbial community phenotypes and
potential functional pathways were predicted using BugBase and PICRUSt2,
respectively.ResultsThe FTG group exhibited significantly diminished
alpha diversity (Simpson index, p=0.01071) relative to the ENG group.
Beta diversity analysis demonstrated significant dissimilarities in
microbial community structure between the groups (p&lt;0.05). Taxonomic
profiling revealed a significant enrichment in the relative abundance of
potential periodontopathogenic genera, including Streptococcus and
Filifactor, within the FTG group, concomitantly with a significant
depletion of health-associated genera such as Rothia and Neisseria. A
predictive model constructed using the Boruta-SHAP algorithm, based on
15 key genera, effectively discriminated between fatigue and non-fatigue
states, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUC) of 0.948. Phenotypic predictions indicated a significant
increase in the proportion of bacteria harboring Mobile Genetic Elements
(MGEs) (p=0.048), alongside significant reductions in the proportion of
aerobic bacteria (p=0.006) and biofilm-forming capacity (p=0.002) in the
FTG group. Functional pathway analysis (PICRUSt2) revealed an enrichment
of pathways such as “Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction” in the FTG
group, whereas pathways pertinent to energy metabolism (e.g., Citrate
cycle (TCA cycle), Oxidative phosphorylation) and amino acid metabolism
(e.g., Phenylalanine metabolism, Histidine metabolism) were
significantly enriched in the ENG group.ConclusionThis study provides
novel evidence that physiological fatigue induces significant structural
and functional alterations in the salivary microbiome of healthy
individuals. These perturbations include diminished microbial diversity,
disrupted community architecture, enrichment of potential opportunistic
pathogens, and marked shifts in key metabolic pathways, particularly
those governing neuroactivity and energy metabolism. These findings
suggest that the salivary microbiome may be implicated in the
physiological regulation of fatigue, potentially via an
“oral-microbiome-brain axis,” and underscore its potential as a source
of non-invasive biomarkers for assessing fatigue status. Further
mechanistic investigations are warranted to elucidate these
interactions.</p>

<p>Phage therapy is emerging as a promising strategy against the growing
threat of antimicrobial resistance, yet phage and bacteria are
incredibly diverse and idiosyncratic in their interactions with one
another. Clinical applications of phage therapy often rely on a process
of manually screening collections of naturally occurring phages for
activity against a specific clinical isolate of bacteria, a
labor-intensive task that is not guaranteed to yield a phage with
optimal activity against a particular isolate. Herein, we review recent
advances in artificial intelligence (AI) approaches that are advancing
the study of phage-host interactions in ways that might enable the
design of more effective phage therapeutics. In light of concurrent
advances in synthetic biology enabling rapid genetic manipulation of
phages, we envision how these AI-derived insights could inform the
genetic optimization of the next generation of synthetic phages.</p>

the innate immune system to acquire memory and improve their
non-specific defense functions. This trial was conducted to evaluate the
prophylactic effect of intraperitoneal injection of yeast β-glucan after
birth on diarrhea in Holstein calves during the first 74 days of
age.MethodsA total of 52 healthy newborn Holstein calves (body weight
39.3 ± 0.82 kg) were enrolled and randomly assigned into two groups (n =
26 in per group): 1) placebo group (CON), and 2) intraperitoneal
injection with yeast β-glucan solution (0.1 g/mL, 50 mg/kg body weight)
at 3 and 6 days of age (IP). The CON group received an equal volume of
sterile saline at the same time. Body weight was measured monthly, and
health checks and fecal consistency were evaluated daily for every calf.
Jugular blood and rectal feces were collected at 7 and 30 days of
age.ResultsIP induced inflammation in calves, which was manifested as
obvious increased levels of serum cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-a),
immunoglobulin (IgG and IgM), and oxidative stress after 24 h, and the
antimicrobial substance (defensin and secreted immunoglobulin A) in
feces also significantly increased, but stimulation didn’t lead to a
higher level of serum diamine oxidase (DAO). The pre-stimulation had no
positive effect on growth performance or feed efficiency, but reduced
the frequencies of diarrhea and bovine respiratory disease, especially
during 31-60 d. Furthermore, the pre-stimulation increased the levels of
serum IL-6, fecal defensin and secreted immunoglobulin A, while
decreased the levels of serum DAO and malonaldehyde at 30 d. In
addition, compared with the ones in the CON group, calves in the IP
group showed a better rectal bacterial structure at 30 d, with a more
enrichment of beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacterium.DiscussionOur
findings suggested that early stimulation with yeast β-glucan could be a
promising strategy for reducing the frequencies of both diarrhea and BRD
in calves.</p>

for bone infections: antibacterial mechanisms and immunomodulatory
effects</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>As the global population continues to age, an increasing number of
individuals suffer from osteoporosis, fractures, bone infections, and
bone tumors. Among these, bone infection is considered one of the most
challenging clinical infections due to its high recurrence rate,
bacterial resistance, high incidence, and substantial treatment costs.
However, these challenges underscore the urgent need for clinicians to
develop novel therapeutic strategies to improve the current cure rate
and reduce the mortality associated with bone infections. Current
scientific research on bone infections primarily focuses on developing
new antibacterial targets and infection-resistant biomaterials. In
recent years, remarkable advancements have been made in anti-infective
biomaterials, offering promising solutions to overcome bone infections.
By optimizing the biological properties of biomaterials or integrating
them with other materials, researchers aim to achieve maximum
antibacterial efficacy and biocompatibility. Such advancements enhance
the integration of biomaterials with soft tissues, improve interactions
between bone cells and biomaterials, promote osteogenesis, and mitigate
inflammatory responses. This review primarily focuses on exploring the
antibacterial mechanisms of infection-resistant biomaterials and their
regulatory effects on the immune system, with particular emphasis on
nanoscale carriers, scaffolds, and particulate materials.</p>

exploits steroidogenic machinery, triggers lipid metabolism for viral
replication and induces immune response in Leydig cells of K18-hACE2
mice</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundDuring COVID-19 pandemic, men had reduced serum
testosterone and higher mortality rate than women. Variations in high
density lipoprotein (HDL) levels were detected in severe COVID-19
individuals. We evaluated the response of testicular macrophages,
steroidogenic activity and lipid metabolism of Leydig cells in
SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice.MethodsTestes were analyzed under
light and electron microscope. Immunolocalization of human angiotensin
converting enzyme (hACE2) and viral proteins (spike and nucleocapsid)
were evaluated in association with the expression of viral recognition
receptor, Rigi. Steroidogenesis was evaluated by the expression of
steroidogenic factor-1 (Sf1), and the immunolocalization of
steroidogenic proteins and testosterone. Pro-inflammatory (TNF-α, IL-1β,
IL-6), anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines, macrophages (CD68 and CD163)
and macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF) were detected by
immunolocalization and Western blot. The expression of lipid metabolism
genes (Srebp, Dgat1 and Scarb1) were investigated by RT-qPCR.ResultsIn
the infected animals, the Leydig cells showed enhanced
immunolocalization of hACE2, spike and nucleocapsid. The expression of
Rigi, pro-inflammatory cytokines and number of macrophages increased,
confirming viral infection. Sf1 expression, steroidogenic proteins and
testosterone were reduced whereas the expression of Dgat1, Srebp and
Scarb1 increased. Lipid droplets-enriched Leydig cells and viral
particles in lipids were observed. The infected Leydig cells also showed
enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokines immunolabeling.ConclusionSARS-CoV-2
infects Leydig cells, activates its immune response and impairs
steroidogenesis. The virus uses the steroidogenic machinery and induces
lipid metabolism pathways for its survival and replication in these
cells. These findings support the low testosterone and HDL levels in men
with severe COVID-19.</p>

infiltration of neutrophils and Th17 cells</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal
interstitial lung disease. However, the pathogeny of IPF is poorly
understood, and therapeutic options are very limited. Periodontitis (PD)
is a chronic inflammatory disease that leads to dysbiosis of both the
oral microbiome and host immune responses. While previous studies have
suggested a PD-IPF association, insights into the mechanisms remain
limited.MethodsThe PD mouse model was established by the ligation of
molars and oral inoculation of subgingival plaques from PD patients and
subsequently incorporated with a bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis
model. The effect of PD on pulmonary fibrosis was determined. Changes of
immune cells were analysed using flow cytometry. Moreover, the
microbiome changes of the lungs and oral cavity were assessed by 16S
rRNA gene sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Finally,
the effect and mechanism of the specific PD pathogen on pulmonary
fibrosis were determined.ResultsPD significantly aggravated pulmonary
fibrosis in mice by increasing the infiltration of neutrophils and Th17
cells. Neutrophils and Th17 cells are critical in PD-induced aggravation
of pulmonary fibrosis, and Th17 cells regulate neutrophils via IL-17A.
The PD pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) was detected enriched in
both the oral cavity and lungs. Pg was further determined to exacerbate
pulmonary fibrosis by increasing the expansion of neutrophils and Th17
cells in mice.ConclusionPD aggravates pulmonary fibrosis in mice, which
is likely induced by Pg-promoted infiltration of neutrophils and Th17
cells. Treatment targeting PD or Pg might be a promising strategy to
clinically ameliorate IPF.</p>

microRNA-155 expression is altered in extracellular vesicles derived
from the COPD epithelium</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundInfluenza virus particularly affects those with chronic
lung conditions such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).
Airway epithelial cells are the first line of defense and primary target
of influenza infection and release extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs can
transfer of biological molecules such as microRNAs (miRNAs) that can
modulate the immune response to viruses through control of the innate
and adaptive immune systems. The aim of this work was to profile the EV
miRNAs released from bronchial epithelial cells in response to influenza
infection and discover if EV miRNA expression was altered in
COPD.MethodsInfluenza infection of air-liquid interface (ALI)
differentiated BCi-NS1.1 epithelial cells were characterized by
analyzing the expression of antiviral genes, cell barrier permeability
and cell death. EVs were isolated by filtration and size exclusion
chromatography from the apical surface wash of ALI cultured bronchial
epithelial cells. The EV miRNA cargo was sequenced and reads mapped to
miRBase. The BCi sequencing results were further investigated by RT-qPCR
and by using healthy and COPD primary epithelial cells.ResultsInfection
of ALI cultured BCi cells with IAV at 3.6 x 106 IU/ml for 24 h led to
significant upregulation of anti-viral genes without high levels of cell
death. EV release from ALI-cultured BCi cells was confirmed using
electron microscopy and detection of known tetraspanin EV markers using
western blot and the ExoView R100 platform. Differential expression
analyses identified 5 miRNA that had a fold change of &gt;0.6:
miR-155-5p, miR-122-5p, miR-378a-3p, miR-7-5p and miR-146a-5p
(FDR&lt;0.05). Differences between EV, non-EV and cellular levels of
these miRNA were detected. Primary epithelial cell release of EV and
their miRNA cargo was similar to that observed for BCi. Intriguingly,
miR-155 expression was decreased in EVs derived from COPD patients
compared to EVs from control samples.ConclusionEpithelial EV miRNA
release may be a key mechanism in modulating the response to IAV in the
lungs. Furthermore, changes in EV miRNA expression may play a
dysfunctional role in influenza-induced exacerbations of COPD. However,
further work to fully characterize the function of EV miRNA in response
to IAV in both health and COPD is required.</p>

of the Wnt signaling pathway and its role in epithelial-mesenchymal
transition and hepatic fibrosis in alveolar echinococcosis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveThis study examined the effects of Echinococcus
multilocularis infection on the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway
in hepatocytes, its association with epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT), and its role in E. multilocularis-induced hepatic
fibrosis.MethodsHepatic lesion tissues were obtained from 20 patients
with clinically diagnosed alveolar echinococcosis (AE). These tissues
were categorized into near-lesion and distant-from-lesion groups.
Additionally, a murine model of AE infection was developed through the
injection of E. multilocularis protoscoleces. The mice were divided into
control, Wnt pathway enhancement (Wnt3a), and Wnt pathway inhibition
(DKK1) groups. Four weeks post-infection, AAV-EGFP, AAV-Wnt3a-EGFP, or
AAV-DKK1-EGFP vectors were administered, followed by tissue collection
four weeks later. Both human and murine liver tissues were analyzed
using Masson’s trichrome, hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E), and Sirius
red staining, as well as immunohistochemical and western blot analyses
to assess protein expression levels associated with EMT and
fibrosis.ResultsElevated expression levels of Wnt3a, β-catenin,
N-cadherin, Col1a1, α-SMA, Vimentin, CTGF, and TGF-β were observed in
tissues adjacent to human AE lesions and in the Wnt3a-treated mouse
group. Conversely, E-cadherin expression was low. Immunohistochemical
analysis demonstrated lower expression of Wnt3a, β-catenin, and other
EMT- and fibrosis-related proteins in perilesional areas in human
tissues and in the DKK1-treated mouse group, while increased E-cadherin
expression was elevated. Inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis
were observed near human lesions, whereas the DKK1-treated mouse group
exhibited significantly reduced fibrosis.ConclusionThe Wnt signaling
pathway plays a key role in the development of hepatic fibrosis
associated with AE infection. Its activation is positively correlated
with EMT and the increased expression of fibrogenic markers, including
Collagen I, CTGF, and TGF-β, thereby contributing to the progression of
hepatic fibrosis in hepatic AE.</p>

and application of multiplex PCR-dipstick DNA chromatography for the
detection of eight respiratory bacterial pathogens</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundCommunity-acquired pneumonia is primarily caused by
Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae,
Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus,
Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae, leading to severe
illness and death in developing countries.MethodsA rapid,
straightforward, sensitive, high-throughput, and precise multiplex
PCR-dipstick DNA chromatography assay was devised. This innovative
technique was specifically engineered for the immediate and efficient
detection of the aforementioned eight respiratory pathogens, with
particular emphasis on scenarios involving co-infections.
Custom-designed specific primers were employed, wherein the 5′ end of
the forward primers was tagged with oligonucleotide tags (Tag) and the
5′ end of the reverse primers was conjugated with biotin. A C3 spacer
was incorporated to bridge the Tag and the forward primer. Complementary
oligonucleotides (cTag) corresponding to each of the eight pathogens
were immobilized within the test area of the test strip. Meanwhile,
biotin was strategically utilized to create an internal control line at
the distal end of the test strip. The biotin moiety at the 5′ end of the
reverse primer was engineered to interact with blue latex microspheres
coated with streptavidin, thereby triggering a detectable signal.
Following the PCR amplification of the target DNA fragments, during the
membrane strip chromatography hybridization process, the Tag- and
biotin-labeled target DNA engaged in a dual interaction. First, it bound
to the blue latex microspheres via streptavidin–biotin binding, and
second, it hybridized with the cTag on the membrane strip. This led to
the accumulation of captured blue latex microspheres at both the test
line and the internal control line, manifesting as visible blue bands. A
total of 186 respiratory sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
specimens were collected and analyzed. The multiplex PCR-dipstick DNA
chromatography assay was deployed for detection, while traditional
bacterial culture was also carried out in parallel for comparative
purposes. To rigorously validate the accuracy of the multiplex
PCR-dipstick DNA chromatography assay in identifying PCR products, DNA
sequencing was performed on all PCR products derived from the clinical
samples.ResultsThe multiplex PCR-dipstick DNA chromatography assay
demonstrated remarkable efficacy, being capable of specifically
discriminating among the eight pathogens within a remarkably short
timeframe of 40 minutes. The detection limit for individual bacterial
species ranged from 10 to 102 CFU/mL. Notably, no cross-reactions were
observed among the eight target bacteria, nor with other representative
respiratory bacteria, including Acinetobacter junii, Enterobacter
cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Pseudomonas
fluorescens, Aeromonas hydrophila, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The
concordance between the results obtained from the multiplex PCR-dipstick
DNA chromatography assay and those from DNA sequencing was absolute,
with a kappa value of 1.00.ConclusionA successful multiplex PCR-dipstick
DNA chromatography assay was established for the simultaneous detection
of eight respiratory bacterial pathogens and was effectively applied in
clinical sample analysis. This indicates that this single-use device has
promising potential for analyzing the microbial composition related to
respiratory infections and is also suitable for small laboratories and
field diagnostics.</p>

respiratory syncytial virus morphology: distinct structural and
molecular signatures of spherical and filamentous particles</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a pleomorphic enveloped virus
that buds as both spherical and filamentous particles. The determinants
of RSV particle morphology and the roles of these forms in transmission
and pathogenicity are not clearly defined, owing to a complex interplay
of viral proteins and host factors that remains poorly understood. To
further characterize RSV morphology, we developed a sucrose gradient
velocity sedimentation method to separate spherical and filamentous
virions. Fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy (EM) confirmed
two distinct peaks containing predominantly spherical or filamentous
particles, respectively. Notably, EM images revealed a distinctive
“honeycomb” pattern on the RSV envelope, suggesting an ordered lattice
of glycoproteins on the virion surface. Biochemical analyses of viral
protein and lipid content showed that filamentous particles contained
higher levels of uncleaved fusion protein F0 and exhibited distinct
phospholipid profiles compared to spherical particles. Both forms were
enriched in cholesterol and phospholipids characteristic of lipid rafts,
consistent with the idea that RSV buds from lipid raft microdomains.
This enrichment in raft lipids is linked to cell-to-cell fusion
(syncytium) formation and virion assembly. Quantitative real-time PCR
analysis indicated a high particle-to-PFU ratio (~4:1), meaning only
about one in four RSV virions was infectious. Spherical particles
contained on average ~3 genomic RNA copies per virion, whereas
filamentous particles contained ~2 copies. These data reveal several
structural and compositional differences between RSV particle
morphologies that may influence viral pathogenesis, and they provide a
foundation for new antiviral approaches targeting virion assembly and
morphology.</p>

<p>ObjectivePseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen
responsible for nosocomial infections in critically ill and
immunocompromised patients. To elucidate genomic-phenotypic-clinical
correlations in P. aeruginosa infections, this study integrates targeted
next-generation sequencing (tNGS) with conventional diagnostics.MethodsA
retrospective study was conducted between September, 2023 and December,
2024 at The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University on
patient specimens that were subjected to both conventional culture and
tNGS testing. Only a single Gram-negative bacterium, P. aeruginosa, was
detected by tNGS, and these isolates were subsequently analyzed in order
to compare their genomic profiling (virulence/resistance genes),
antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), and clinical
characteristics.ResultsA total of 105 samples were included in the
study. Exoenzyme Y gene (exoY) and O-antigen polymerase gene (wzy) were
detected in 77.1% and 12.4% of the samples, respectively. Meanwhile,
aminoglycoside acetyltransferase gene (aac(6’)aac(3’)), aminoglycoside
resistance methyltransferase gene (armA), and chloram phenicol
resistance genes (cmlA) were detected in 6.7%, 4.8%, and 12.4% of the
samples, respectively. P. aeruginosa isolates detected the exoY gene
exhibit a higher level of drug resistance, particularly to cefepime
(32.1% vs 4.2%, p&lt;0.05) and piperacillin-tazobactam (33.3% vs 8.3%,
p&lt;0.05). aac(6’)aac(3’) and armA genes were statistically associated
with tobramycin resistance (p&lt;0.05). The use of antibiotics before
hospitalization (within 90 days), hospital-acquired infections, ICU
admission, as well as pre-P. aeruginosa detection interventions
including invasive procedures, catheterization, mechanical ventilation,
duration of antibiotic use time≥14 days, and antibiotic use type ≥3
types (p&lt;0.05) is associated with multidrug-resistant (MDR) and
carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (CRPA) infections (p&lt;0.05).
Furthermore, the detection of MDR and CRPA strains appears to lead to an
increase in the duration and variety of antibiotic use, as well as
prolonged of hospital stay (p&lt;0.05).ConclusionOur study highlights
the importance of integrating tNGS results, which provide insights into
pathogen identification, resistance, and virulence genes, with
phenotypic and clinical data in order to enhance the accuracy of
diagnosis and guide treatment strategies.</p>

<p>date: 2025-05-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionMalaria is a vector-borne parasitic disease that affects
millions worldwide. To achieve the objective set by the World Health
Organization of reducing malaria cases by 2030, antimalarial drugs with
novel modes of action are required. Previously, a novel mechanism of
action of chloroquine (CQ) was reported involving features of programmed
cell death in the parasite, mainly characterized by calcium efflux from
digestive vacuole permeabilization. Increased intracellular calcium
induces suicidal death of erythrocytes, a process known as eryptosis.
This study aimed to identify the hallmarks of eryptosis due to calcium
redistribution and examine the downstream cellular effects during CQ
treatment in infected red blood cells (iRBCs).MethodsSynchronized
Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 cultures at mid-late trophozoites were treated
with CQ and other antimalarial compounds for 10 hours. Eryptotic
markers, including phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, cell shrinkage and
membrane blebbing, were assessed by flow cytometry, scanning electron
microscopy and western blot, respectively. Extracellular vesicles (EVs)
were isolated from 3D7 malaria culture supernatants using differential
ultracentrifugation, followed by their physical and proteomic
characterization. THP-1-derived macrophages were stimulated with EVs to
determine parasite-host interactions, as indicated by cytokine levels
and transcriptomic analysis.ResultsIncreased PS exposure, cell
shrinkage, and membrane blebbing were observed, delineating an eryptotic
phenotype in the host RBCs. Notably, the outward budding and blebbing of
the iRBC plasma membrane led to the formation of EVs, which are complex
structures with unique functional properties. Proteomic characterization
of EVs from CQ-treated iRBCs revealed a high enrichment of proteasome
and ribosome protein clusters. This unique EV cargo did not influence
the parasite growth rate but might activate IFN signaling pathways
mediated by IL-6 in THP-1-derived macrophages.ConclusionThese findings
provide new insights into a novel drug-induced cell death mechanism that
targets the parasite and specific components of the infected host
RBC.</p>

<p>date: 2025-05-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveCOVID-19 has had a profound impact on public health
globally. However, most studies have focused on patients with long COVID
or those in the acute phase of infection, with limited research on the
health of individuals who have recovered from mild COVID-19. This study
investigates the long-term changes in bacterial and fungal communities
in individuals recovering from mild COVID-19 and their clinical
relevance.MethodsHealthy individuals from Hainan Province were enrolled
before the COVID-19 outbreak, along with individuals recovering from
COVID-19 at 3 months and 6 months post-recovery. Stool, blood samples,
and metadata were collected. Metagenomic sequencing and Internal
Transcribed Spacer (ITS) analysis characterized bacterial and fungal
communities, while bacterial-fungal co-occurrence networks were
constructed. A random forest model evaluated the predictive capacity of
key taxa.ResultsThe gut microbiota of COVID-19 recoverees differed
significantly from that of healthy individuals. At 3 months
post-recovery, probiotics (e.g., Blautia massiliensis and Kluyveromyces
spp.) were enriched, linked to improved metabolism, while at 6 months,
partial recovery of probiotics (e.g., Acidaminococcus massiliensis and
Asterotremella spp.) was observed alongside persistent pathogens (e.g.,
Streptococcus equinus and Gibberella spp.). Dynamic changes were
observed, with Acidaminococcus massiliensis enriched at both baseline
and 6 months but absent at 3 months. Co-occurrence network analysis
revealed synergies between bacterial (Rothia spp.) and fungal
(Coprinopsis spp.) taxa, suggesting their potential roles in gut
restoration. The bacterial random forest model (10 taxa) outperformed
the fungal model (8 taxa) in predicting recovery status (AUC = 0.99
vs. 0.80).ConclusionThese findings highlight the significant long-term
impacts of mild COVID-19 recovery on gut microbiota, with key taxa
influencing metabolism and immune regulation, supporting
microbiome-based strategies for recovery management.</p>

MCM protein expression in Trypanosoma cruzi: insights into
metacyclogenesis and G1 arrested epimastigotes</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Trypanosoma cruzi is a protozoan parasite that is the etiological
agent of Chagas disease, which is endemic to Latin America with reported
cases in non-endemic regions such as Europe, Asia, and Oceania due to
migration. During its lifecycle, T. cruzi alternates between replicative
and non-replicative infective lifeforms. Metacyclogenesis is the most
studied transition of the T. cruzi life cycle, where replicative
epimastigotes differentiate into infective metacyclic trypomastigotes
inside the gut of the triatomine vector. This early-branching organism
expresses a divergent pre-replication complex (pre-RC) where the only
conserved component is the MCM2–7 protein family. Given the role of
pre-RC components in cell cycle regulation, we investigated whether MCM
expression and location could be involved in proliferation control in
epimastigotes and during metacyclogenesis. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we tagged
MCM subunits and tracked their expression and subcellular localization.
Our findings reveal that MCM subunits are consistently expressed and
localized to the nucleus throughout the epimastigote cell cycle,
including in G1/G0-arrested cells. However, MCM subunits are degraded
during metacyclogenesis as cells enter the G0 state, marking the
transition to replication arrest. Therefore, epimastigotes arrested in
G1/G0 can either maintain MCM complex expression and resume the cell
cycle when conditions become favorable, or they can undergo
metacyclogenesis, exiting the cell cycle and entering a G0 state, where
MCM subunits are degraded as part of the replication repression
mechanism.</p>

of metagenomic and targeted next-generation sequencing in lower
respiratory tract fungal infections</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectivesThis study aims to compare the diagnostic efficiency and
consistency of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and
targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) in patients with lower
respiratory tract fungal infections.MethodsA total of 115 patients with
probable pulmonary infection between September 2022 and April 2023 were
enrolled at the Second Xiangya Hospital, Changsha, China, of which 61
were clinically diagnosed with invasive pulmonary fungal infection
(IPFI) and 54 were non-IPFI cases. All patients received bronchoalveolar
lavage, with mNGS, tNGS, and cultures being conducted paralleled.
Diagnostic effectiveness and consistency in detecting microorganisms
were compared.ResultsBoth mNGS and tNGS showed high sensitivity rates of
95.08% each, with specificity of 90.74% and 85.19%, respectively. They
also demonstrated positive predictive values (PPVs) of 92.1% and 87.9%
and negative predictive values (NPVs) of 94.2% and 93.9%, respectively,
in diagnosing IPFI. The sensitivity and NPV of mNGS and tNGS were
superior to that of any individual or combined conventional
microbiological tests (CMTs) (P &lt; 0.05). The consistency of culture
with mNGS and tNGS was 48.70% and 50.43%, respectively. For fungal
detection, Pneumocystis jirovecii (26/61, 42.6%; and 28/61, 45.9%),
Candida albicans (19/61, 31.1%; and 21/61, 34.4%), and Aspergillus
fumigatus (16/61, 26.2%; and 15/61, 24.6%) are most prevalent for mNGS
and tNGS in enrolled cases, and the detection rate was greatly higher
than that of culture. Furthermore, mNGS and tNGS were capable of
diagnosing mixed infections in 65 and 55 out of the 115 cases, whereas
only nine cases of bacterial-fungal infection were detected by
culture.ConclusionThe diagnostic efficacy of mNGS and tNGS was
comparable to that of identified IPFI. NGS-based methodologies present a
promising tool for detecting IPFI, which can be a good supplement to
CMT.</p>

16S rRNA sequencing and metabolomics reveal abnormal metabolism activity
in preterm infants with different gestational ages</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveThis study aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the
differences in gut microbiota and metabolomics in preterm infants
stratified by gestational age.MethodsFresh fecal samples were collected
from neonates within the first 3 days after birth. The gut microbiota
composition and the changes in specific taxa abundance were analyzed
using 16S rRNA sequencing. Metabolomic profiling was performed using
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Participants
were categorized into four groups based on gestational age at birth:
PreA group (34–36 weeks), PreB group (32–33 weeks), PreC group (28–31
weeks), and control group (37–42 weeks). Metabolic pathways were
identified through metabolomics analysis, referencing the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database.ResultsNotably,
Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) showed clear separation among
samples from all groups, with significant differences noted in the PreC
group when compared with the other three. We found a strong association
between Escherichia-Shigella and Ureaplasma genera with infants born
before 32 weeks of gestation, suggesting a higher risk of opportunistic
infections for preterm infants under this gestational threshold. As
gestational age increases, Megamonas and Prevotella gradually emerged,
while Escherichia-Shigella and Ureaplasma progressively diminished. KEGG
enrichment analysis indicated that Pyrimidine metabolism was a
differentially regulated pathway between the PreA group and the control
group. Interestingly, the only major differential metabolic pathway
between the PreB group and the control group was Arachidonic acid
metabolism. The bubble diagram revealed significant enrichment of
differential metabolites in Pyrimidine and beta-Alanine metabolism
pathways when comparing the PreC group with the control
group.ConclusionSignificant differences were observed in the fecal
microbiome and metabolome between preterm and full-term infants,
particularly in those born before 32 weeks of gestation. These findings
suggested that the gut microbial system in preterm infants undergone
progressive maturation, approaching a “healthy” state characteristic of
full-term infants as gestational age increases.</p>
