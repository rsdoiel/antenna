<p>date: 2025-05-20, updated: 2025-05-20, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Wizards of the Coast didn’t have an official Portuguese translation
of the rules for Dungeons &amp; Dragons until 2022, eight years after

<p>Poochyena, the bite Pokémon from Hoenn, can be found in the wild in
Pokémon Go. Yes, Poochyena can be shiny in Pokémon Go! Mightyena isn’t
actually a complete wash in the Great League of PvP, but its shadow
version is preferred. Either way, these are pretty nice shinies — and as
with all shinies, they’re […]</p>

<p>The Super Smash Bros. Melee tournament Full House 2025 finals ended
in the most anticlimactic way Sunday — and it’s all because of an
extremely rare glitch. The tourney featured a showdown between
fourth-ranked Kurtis “Moky” Pratt and Cody Schwab, the second-ranked
