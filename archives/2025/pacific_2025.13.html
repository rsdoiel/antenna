receive generous donations from Andersen AFB’s Airman Leadership School
Class 25-C. As part of their curriculum, ALS students focused on giving
back to the community in a monumental way, collecting 1.8K in donated
items, including sports equipment, school supplies, and student rewards
— 63 sports balls included! Their class theme for this project, “Leaders
Helping Leaders,” reflects their understanding of the significant role
educators play in shaping students’ futures. Over the past few weeks,
this team of 19 students received their own leadership development under
the guidance of instructors TSgt Weldy, SSgt Williams, SSgt Morris,
Commandant MSgt Hocog, and Class Mentor, Tinian Local SMSgt Cabrera. A
huge thank you to ALS Class 25-C for your generosity and dedication to
our students! Your support truly makes a lasting impact.</p>
