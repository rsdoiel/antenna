## From the 2024 Recommended Reading List: Rest in Peaches by Alex Brown

<p><strong>Here&#8217;s a highlight from our 2024 Recommended Reading List: </strong><strong>Rest in Peaches</strong> by Alex Brown, out from Page Street Publishing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thoughtful social commentary about race and the justice system is baked into this entertainingly absurd, page-turning slasher [&#8230;]. Delightfully heart-pounding, suspenseful, and campy horror.&#8221;
<strong>―Kirkus Reviews, starred review</strong></p>

## Rules for 2024 IFDB Awards

date: 2025-02-01, from: IF Database News

The IFDB Awards is an annual competition designed to award excellence in creating interactive fiction.It is held from February 1st to the first weekend after February 15th each year on the Interactive Fiction Database, and take the form of polls.</P>

Votes are public but anonymized. Every IFDB member is eligible to vote, except for one special poll, the Author’s Choice Poll. Eligibility to vote in the Author’s Choice competition is determined by having a game linked to your IFDB profile (this can be found by editing a game page and use the ‘Link to Author’s Profile’ feature. Authors added incorrectly to a game will not be permitted to vote (for instance, if someone associates a random game they didn’t make to their account).</P>

Rules for discussion and voting
<br>
-Voting must be in good faith and be based on personal experience with the games involved.<br>

-Campaigning or organizing voting is not allowed if it breaks the above rule.<br>

-Discussion of games on merit is allowed and encouraged.<br>

-There is no hard limit on how many votes a person can cast in each poll for different games. A player voting for so many games that it makes voting difficult for others (such as voting for every game from the whole year) may have their votes removed, but only after warning.<br>

-Author cannot vote for their own games. Such votes will be removed so that the running tallies are correct. Authors can post about their own games (for instance on intfiction) as long as doesn’t encourage people to break the rules (such as telling people to vote for your game even if they haven’t played it).
</P>

Code of conduct
</P>
-Voters must abide by the <A HREF="https://ifdb.org/code-of-conduct">IFDB Code of Conduct</A>. Harassment of other voters (including on other platforms) and creating multiple accounts for one person are prohibited.
</P>
Moderation
-Votes that are cast incorrectly (for instance, voting for a Twine game in a Choicescript poll) or fraudulently (for instance, using sockpuppet accounts) may be removed.
</P>
Eligibility
<br>
-For most polls, games are eligible if they are listed on IFDB and have a publication date during 2024.<br>

-For system-specific polls, games additionally must have the appropriate system or genre listed on their IFDB page under the specified field.<br>

-Each poll will have a link to an IFDB search listing suggested games. Outside of system-based polls, users can vote for any game they feel fits the criteria.<br>

-Any IFDB user can edit game pages to confirm eligibility. However, malicious editing (such as adding every genre to a game or adding incorrect systems to a game) will be reverted or removed.<br>

-Any game author can opt out of the competition. Adding a note to the game page during the competition may be helpful to let others know not to vote for it, but opting out should be officially done by messaging the organizer (me, for now).<br>

</P>
Results
<br>
-Results will be clearly visible throughout the poll. However, there will be a grace period of up to 3 days at the end to allow checking of votes before the official announcements, which will be made on Intfiction and IFDB.<br>

-Polls with very low traffic will not have a winner awarded. This is left up to organizer discretion, but low traffic may include less than 5 votes for the winning game or less than ten votes total cast.</P>


Future of Awards
</P>
One of the main purposes of these new awards is to be community-owned and regular. They need to keep working even if I don’t keep working.</P>


The awards begin on February 1st of each year. If Feb 1st passes without the current organizer having created the polls, anyone can create the polls themselves.</P>

The community can propose new changes to awards or new organizers via public discussion. A public yes/no poll on intfiction with more than 50% voting yes can be used to add new organizers. Current organizers can also add in other organizers or successors, subject to a public veto.

## How Sundance’s ‘Rabbit Trap’ Screenplay Took Shape

date: 2025-01-31, from: Final Draft blog

<div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"> 
 <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/how-sundances-rabbit-trap-screenplay-took-shape" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"> <img src="https://blog.finaldraft.com/hubfs/Dev%20Patel%20grasps%20onto%20his%20headphones%20listening%20intently%20in%20Rabbit%20Trap.png" alt="Dev Patel grasps onto his headphones listening intently in 'Rabbit Trap'" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"> </a> 
</div> 
<p>For his feature debut and Sundance premiere <em>Rabbit Trap</em>, writer/director Bryn Chainey took what might seem like an unconventional path to develop the period horror story.&nbsp;<br><br>After drafting two unproduced features with the goal of trying to fit industry expectations, Chainey decided to follow his creative instincts wherever they led. The result is a genre-defying work that weaves together folk horror elements with experimental music and striking visuals, emerging from a deeply personal creative process.<br><br>In <em>Rabbit Trap</em>, Daphne (Rosy McEwen) and Darcy (Dev Patel) move to the 1970s Welsh countryside to work on Daphne’s experimental album. Her music is full of droning, buzzing, theremin and spoken vocals. Darcy spends his days recording audio on the moors, until one day he picks up a strange vibration. Nightmares keep him up at night. Then, one day, they see a puckish child (Jade Croot) watching their cottage—and he’s soon enmeshed in their lives in a way that threatens all of them.<br><br>Instead of traditional outlining, Chainey said he started with his fascinations—images, sounds, and ideas that captured his imagination. Through journaling and self-interrogation, he allowed sometimes seemingly disconnected elements to find their own connections.<br><br>Landscapes morphed into scenes, musical patterns suggested character moments, and even the growth patterns of mushrooms influenced the film’s visual language. It’s a unique process and a way to connect thematic and visual threads. What results is an atmospheric story and one of the strongest folk horror tales I’ve seen in years.<br><br>Final Draft chatted with the filmmaker just before his Sundance premiere at a very chilly Eccles.&nbsp;<br><br>Chainey opened up about his distinctive approach to screenwriting, his methods for solving creative problems, and why staying true to your artistic vision might be the most important lesson any filmmaker can learn.&nbsp;<br><br>His insights offer valuable guidance for creators looking to find their own path through the murky landscape of independent film.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Draft: So you’re blending a few different things in the script. You’ve got folk horror. You’ve got experimental music elements. How do you approach putting that all on the page?&nbsp;</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bryn Chainey</span>: For me, I do a lot of journaling. When I write, I get fixated on certain things at different times. I get a certain kind of music or a landscape or an image or a color, and I just journal. I’m like, “Okay, Bryn”—I do it as questions. Why is this interesting to you? Is it because this is, is it somehow scary to you? Are you intimidated by this? And I just ask myself questions.&nbsp;<br><br>And so I end up with just pages and pages of just ranting, rambling, kind of just asking myself what’s going on. And along the way, rhymes happen in a way.&nbsp;<br><br>I say, “Oh, what I’m fascinated by in the music is actually connected to why I’m interested in mushrooms and the way they grow,” and along the way I find the connection points and they just coalesce.</p>

## Edge of the Known World by Sheri T. Joseph: Review by Alexandra Pierce

<p>khōréo 4.2</p>

## Write On: 'The Performance' Co-Writer Josh Salzberg

<p>“Fugler [Robert Carlyle] was a character that I really connected with from the beginning. I know it sounds a little strange that the Nazi was my way into this, but it really was that idea of, ‘How can we get inside his head and make sure that he’s a fully fleshed out person that way?’” says Josh Salzberg about trying to make his villain, a Nazi named Damien Fugler, a three-dimensional character.<br><br>Josh Salzberg wrote the screenplay for <em>The Performance</em> with co-writer/director Shira Piven. In this episode, Salzberg talks about the challenges of adapting a short story by playwright Arthur Miller that’s about a Jewish-American tap dancer [Jeremy Piven], who’s willing to compromise his own core values to find fame and fortune in Nazi Germany.&nbsp;<br><br>“The idea of all [the characters] is that they're all performing on some level. They all have another life. And that’s true to show business, that we all have sides of ourselves that we’re not sure we want everybody to see or that it’s okay for everybody to see. And then in Berlin in the ‘30s, there’s all these different communities that were impacted – not just the Jews in Germany,” he says.&nbsp;<br><br>Salzberg also talks about his background as a film editor, how it helped him transition to screenwriting, and the challenges of writing morally compromised characters like his protagonist, Harold [Jeremy Piven].&nbsp;<br><br>“I think embracing the mistakes that they make, embracing those flaws and leaning into that is important. Sometimes we can care about our characters to the point where we want them to be likable, which is a note we always get, but we’ve got to be okay with the mistakes – and the consequences for those mistakes. And that was a lesson that Shira and I kept learning as we were developing the script,” he says.&nbsp;<br><br>To hear more about Salzberg’s writing process, listen to the podcast.&nbsp;<br><br><em>Please note: this episode contains discussions regarding racism and anti-semitism.&nbsp;</em><br><br></p>

## A Vile Season by David Ferraro: Review by Alex Brown

<p><strong>A Vile Season</strong>, David Ferraro (Page Street YA 979-8-89003-072-6, $18.99, 400pp, hc) October 2024.</p>
<p>David Ferraro’s new young adult fantasy romance <strong>A Vile Season </strong>is comped as <strong>Bridgerton </strong>meets <strong>The Bachelor </strong>but with vampires. That’s exactly the vibe. Everything from the pacing, the intentionally and flamboyantly anachronistic diversity in the upper classes, the garish wardrobe, the playful disregard for historical accuracy, the overly dramatic rela­tionship conflicts, the marriage competition,  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/01/a-vile-season-by-david-ferraro-review-by-alex-brown/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

<p>Writers of duologies aren’t doing any favors for book reviewers.

## 5 Screenwriting Lessons from Golden-Globe Winner ‘The Brutalist’

</div> 
<p>This year’s winner of the Golden Globe for Best Picture (Drama) and Best Performance by a Male Actor for Adrien Brody (Drama), <em>The Brutalist</em> has become one of the most intriguing films to come out of 2024. Writer/Director Brady Corbet’s mid-century tale follows László Tóth (Adrien Brody), a renowned architect whose ambition and talent lands him in the good graces of a wealthy client who hires him to build a monument on a Pennsylvania hillside. In many ways <em>The Brutalist</em> is an unconventional biopic as it is about a largely unknown figure and clocks in at 3.5 hours long (with an intermission!).&nbsp;</p>

## Fortress Sol by Stephen Baxter: Review by Alexandra Pierce

date: 2025-01-27, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Fortress Sol</strong>, Stephen Baxter (Gollancz 978-1-39961-461-0, £25.00, 480pp, hc). October 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Fortress Sol </strong>is classic Stephen Baxter. It’s driven by big ideas: Humanity’s response to a perceived existential threat includes both dispersing to the stars and mind-boggling engineering projects. Like 2021’s <strong>Galaxias</strong>, the focus is not so much on the alien threat as on humanity’s response. There’s a relatively small cast of characters, who are engag­ing enough but  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/01/fortress-sol-by-stephen-baxter-review-by-alexandra-pierce/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
