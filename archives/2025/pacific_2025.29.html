<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Hawaii&amp;#8217;s public broadcasting stations are scrambling to make up for a sudden loss in federal funding &amp;#8212; forcing Hawaii Public Radio to pull from reserves and hold an emergency fundraising drive, as PBS Hawaii said it remains committed to its community emergency preparedness mission despite the financial strain.&lt;/p&gt;

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;He&amp;#8217;s destroying not only the United States, but the world,&amp;#8221; said Charmaine Kamaka of Hilo at the latest local rally against the Trump administration and its policies. &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t think Mr. Trump understands what he&amp;#8217;s unleashed. People in Hilo don&amp;#8217;t normally do this kind of thing, so if you get Hilo out, it&amp;#8217;s a big deal.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

Mauna Loa is currently quiet and now is a good opportunity to remember the 1950 Southwest Rift Zone eruption &amp;#8212; the volcano&amp;#8217;s most recent eruption to have caused significant damage &amp;#8212; 75 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
