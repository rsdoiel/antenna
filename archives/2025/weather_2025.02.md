Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0648 AM CST Tue Jan 14 2025

Valid 141300Z - 151200Z

...NO THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms are not expected through tonight.

...Discussion...
Thunderstorm potential will be essentially nil today and tonight as
high pressure and stable continental trajectories persist from the
Rockies eastward. A weak low-latitude disturbance over Mexico will
progress northeastward toward Deep South Texas late today.
Warm/moist advection will also increase with airmass modification
over the western Gulf of Mexico and a gradual moistening off the
coast of Deep South Texas. Weak elevated convection may develop late
tonight with the possibility of a few lightning flashes, but this
limited-potential thunderstorm scenario should remain focused
decisively offshore.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0208 AM CST Tue Jan 14 2025

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA...

...Synopsis...
A belt of stronger mid-level east-northeasterly flow, along with
surface high pressure over the Great Basin, will continue to support
a pronounced pressure gradient across southern California, where dry
offshore flow will remain a concern for most of the Day 2
(Wednesday) period. Latest guidance consensus shows at least 25 mph
sustained winds amid 10-20 percent RH across terrain favoring areas
from the Ventura Valley to the Laguna Mountains. These conditions
are most likely during the first half of the period, with Critical
highlights added to address the wildfire-spread potential.
