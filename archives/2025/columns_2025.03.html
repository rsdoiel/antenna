President Biden has signed a

using the US governments procurement power to improve cybersecurity
practices industry-wide.

<p>
The core of the executive order is an array of mandates for protecting
government networks based on lessons learned from recent major
incidents­—namely, the security failures of federal contractors.

<p>
The order requires software vendors to submit proof that they follow
secure development practices, building on

candidates seeking donations.  (Apparently my name is on a lot of

Not doing so is a national security risk.

<p>When I put an image in the margin of a post I often pause and think
about what I want to convey with the image as it relates to the writing
that it’s next to. In the previous piece the idea was interop. I tried
to think of what images I’ve used in the past, then I thought why don’t
I just look. I switched into Daytona, entered
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=interop">interop</a>,

that I liked even more. Tools are important. Web writers haven’t gotten

easy would it be to create a twitter-like app using RSS, and in what
ways would it differ from other twitter-like apps. Here’s the deal. You
need a place to write a posts and a way to read a timeline of posts.
That’s the basic functionality. To do that with RSS you would start with
a blogging app like WordPress, and a feed reader like FeedLand or
NetNewsWire. Manton has integrated the two into a single user interface
at <a href="https://micro.blog/">micro.blog</a>. I’m going to approach
it in a somewhat differently, not sure yet how it will work, but I’m
getting there. And I will offer a way for people to hook in any feed
reader they want, thus opening up innovation to tech-curious users. The
take-away is that you need to handle inbound and outbound feeds. That’s
the basics of being twitter-like.</p>
