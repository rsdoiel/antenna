Blogging: Beaked Whales Feed on Squid</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-24, updated: 2025-01-06, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
A Travers’ beaked whale (<i>Mesoplodon traversii</i>) washed ashore in
New Zealand, and scientists
<a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2024/12/24/scientists-make-shocking-find-inside-worlds-rarest-whale-unexpected-discovery-surprises-experts/">conlcuded</a>
that “the prevalence of squid remains [in its stomachs] suggests that
these deep-sea cephalopods form a significant part of the whale’s diet,
similar to other beaked whale species.”

SDR HAT for SDR on a Raspberry Pi</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
A couple years ago, after I heard about the
<a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/cariboulabs/cariboulite-rpi-hat">CaribouLite
on CrowdSupply</a>, I pre-ordered one.
</p>
<p>
I’ve dabbled in SDR with an <a href="https://amzn.to/3Ckxh5d">RTL-SDR
v3</a> for a few years, even
<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2019/hospital-stay-and-mlb-blackouts-led-me-rtl-sdr-radio">using
one with nrsc5 to listen to baseball games OTA</a> because of silly MLB
blackout restrictions.
</p>
<p>
But low-cost SDRs like the RTL-SDR v3 are receive-only, and have a
limited frequency range, and lower quality RF filtering, so it can be
frustrating if you’re trying to work with lower-power RF… or trying to
transmit at all!

Trump incites mob. Capitol evacuated. A day which will live in infamy.
</div>
</p>
<p>
Objectively, January 6, 2021 was even more of a “day which will live in
infamy” than the Japanese attack on
<a href="https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/topics/pearl-harbor-december-7-1941">Pearl
Harbor</a> on December 7, 1941. It was more insidious because while
Hawaii was an American territory, January 6 was an attack on the actual
center of our government. Had the mob prevailed, the US would have been
defeated, there and then.

<p>
The Capitol police were our last line of defense, they received no help
from military.

<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mcuban.bsky.social/post/3lgbutbllnk2b">Mark
Cuban’s question</a> of what could we do now to make things better. I
forgot that I have two ready-made answers. First, let’s get the
Democrats or whatever its successor is called, on the air 365 days a
year, every year, not just in election years, and have it do many things
other than raise money to buy ads. We need to always be communicating
with each other not just in season. You could see we had a problem when
Obama’s campaign website, which should have become whitehouse.gov was
turned into a stupid feature of the site where people could petition
their government. It said to voters, thanks we’ll take it from here. We
all saw that as putting us in our place. We must be invoved in
governing, not just electing. Second, for podcasts and what’s left of
journalism, it should all move out out of the northeast and into the
country. The hosts should be in St Louis, Dallas, Detroit, Atlanta,
Seattle, Phoenix even Memphis, Miami and Charleston. That would change
the focus not only symbolically, but they could insist that guests go
there to be interviewed. Change the meaning of flyover country. People
would feel different about the country and that would come through.
Democrats tend to cater their ideas to people in the Northeast. This
part of what Repubs say is very true. They do the same thing, only
worse, but they are smart about pretending they don’t. Third, amplify
AOC. She’s the leader we need. The Dems are too scared of Republican
criticism. Stop worrying so much. If they’re complaining that means it’s
working. Her interview on Jon Stewart’s

(<a href="https://www.schneier.com/iword/2024/">IWORD 2024</a>) at Johns

goal was to bring together a diverse set of political scientists, law
professors, philosophers, AI researchers and other industry
practitioners, political activists, and creative types (including
science fiction writers) to discuss how democracy might be reimagined in
the current century…

Yesterday I finished the third Murderbot book, “Rogue Protocol”. It was
definitely an easy breezy read – exactly what I needed after “Parable of
the Sower”, haha – but I can’t help but think I’m not going to remember
a thing that happened in it two months from now, much like my memory of
the second book is pretty much a blank now. It’s still a fun series and
the character of Murderbot itself is excellent and memorable but… yeah…

I’m starting to get really annoyed with iCloud Drive. I’ve been storing
my Obsidian vault there because it’s easy, but it keeps overwriting the
up-to-date versions of notes on my phone with the outdated ones on my
computer, and it seems impossible to revert to the most recent version
so I just lose work? Then there are all these “(conflicted)” versions of
notes that get generated, but not when there actually is a conflict?!?!?
Those are just “iCloud felt like creating a new copy of this note, sans
the last X characters”. They never get created when I’m about to lose
work. I’m so sick of this 😠
</p>
<p>
EDIT: OK, well, good news: I went digging through my Obsidian settings
and found I’d installed some kind of “File recovery” plugin so I could
recover from this issue after all. No thanks to iCloud, which can kick
rocks 👎

So apparently Indie <em>really</em> likes Depeche Mode. I was teasing
her for her obsession with pulling my hair, and started singing “Just
Can’t Get Enough”, which she LOVED, so I started playing the actual song
(because I don’t know any of the words apart from the titular line), and
she also loved that. Then the app went on to autoplay “Personal Jesus”,
and she went bananas with excitement, just in rapture 😆 Good taste,
Indie.

My God, that review of “Dune” I posted on Goodreads in 2012 is up to 136
likes. Last time I checked I swear it was at 26 or something like that.
Half the review is just me bitching about the names of the main
characters, which I disliked for personal reasons I didn’t even explain
in the damn review! Couldn’t my fellow “Dune” haters out there find a
better-written review to shower with likes? lol

<p>“Okinawa Island, officially Okinawa Main Island, is the largest of
the Okinawa Islands and the Ryukyu (Nansei) Islands of Japan in the
Kyushu region. It is the smallest and least populated of the five main
islands of Japan. The island is approximately 106 kilometres (66 mi)
long, an average 11 kilometres (7 mi) wide, and has an area of 1,206.98
square kilometers (466.02 sq mi). It is roughly 640 kilometres (350 nmi;
400 mi) south of the main island of Kyushu and the rest of Japan. It is
500 km (270 nmi; 310 mi) northeast of Taiwan. The total population of
Okinawa Island is 1,384,762. The greater Naha area has roughly 800,000
residents, while the city itself has about 320,000 people. Naha is the
seat of Okinawa Prefecture on the southwestern part of Okinawa Island.
Okinawa has a humid subtropical climate.”</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-22, updated: 2025-01-20, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Artificial intelligence (AI) is writing law today. This has required no
changes in legislative procedure or the rules of legislative bodies—all
it takes is one legislator, or legislative assistant, to use generative
AI in the process of drafting a bill.
</p>
<p>
In fact, the use of AI by legislators is only likely to become more
prevalent. There are currently projects in the US House, US Senate, and
<a href="https://www.popvox.org/blog/assessing-us-congressional-ai-adoption">legislatures
around the world</a> to trial the use of AI in various ways: searching
databases, drafting text, summarizing meetings, performing policy
research and analysis, and more. A Brazilian municipality …

<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
The most depressing moment of Trump 1.0, for me, was leaving the local
supermarket, after seeing the kind of empty shelves you see in third
world countries with broken or non-existent economic systems. This was
when it sunk in how far the United States had fallen.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2021/01/11/klaesAshford.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">But
somehow those of us who survived Covid could relax on January 20, four
years ago – which was also coincidentally the day I got my first Covid
vaccination – the nightmare was over. We could relax for at least a few
months before paying the price that was sure to come when we cleaned the
mess that Trump had created with his January 6 insurrection. The
question was will there be a war over this? Well, I reasoned, as I
assumed the incoming president would, that it’s better if you have to
fight a civil war to do it when the military is responsible to you. But
then a few months turned into a couple of years, and nothing happened.
No indictments. He hadn’t been arrested. I thought geez if we had done
something like what he did, the scale of it, the audacity, the terror,
my god how could he be left to walk around as if nothing had happened. I
figured there must be a reason and our president had a plan. He didn’t.
Neither did journalism. When Trump ran for re-election he got the
consideration any major party candidate would get from the press. As he
is getting now as a newly sworn-in president. But we know his oath is
meaningless.
</p>
<p>
So that day when the shelves were empty is now only the second worst
day, and yesterday I was still living with the respite of a four year
trance of normality, as if all it took was belief that somehow we’d get
through this. But now it’s so depressing. I feel both like dying and
living at the same time. I know many others feel this way. I don’t
imagine too many of the people who voted for Trump are full of joy right
now.
</p>
<p>
If we get another shot at cleaning this up, we must not let that
opportunity slip by.

Sabotage varies from highly technical coup de main acts that require
detailed planning and the use of specially trained operatives, to
innumerable simple acts which the ordinary individual citizen-saboteur
can perform. This paper is primarily concerned with the latter type.
Simple sabotage does not require specially prepared tools or equipment;
it is executed by an ordinary citizen who may or may not act
individually and without the necessity for active connection with an
organized group; and it is carried out in such a way as to involve a
minimum danger of injury, detection, and reprisal. –

<h2 id="bingeworthy-wordland">Bingeworthy + WordLand</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/12/10/thisIsNextYear.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I
spent a few days designing and implementing the protocol that allows
WordLand to be the writing tool for Bingeworthy, thus giving it a real
writing and publishing function, instead of the usual ridiculous tiny
little textbox. Today I’m going to make it work for writing and reading
actual reviews for shows I have opinions about. I’ve always wanted to do
this in a way that it’s not just scattered into the wind, to rely on
Google to find it again. Now I’ll be able to scatter it, and also have
it maintained in context, where it can help me remember what I liked
about a show, and why perhaps I gave it an excellent rating when some
parts really sucked. This was something that was missing in Bingeworthy,
I knew it – just didn’t know how to make it work. Now I think I have it
working.
</p>
<p>
Here’s the flow:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
In Bingeworthy, I rate a program. Then I realize I want to say more, I
want to write a review that explains the rating.
</li>
<li>
I click on the <i>Review in WordLand</i> button. The bingeworthy client
asks for a token from the bingeworthy server. The token is is part of
the database record for the user’s rating of the program being
displayed.
</li>
<li>
The button switches me over to WordLand using window.open, along with a
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/3b3c17e974882409ebf0f715a6f4f1b3">package
of data</a> that gives the editor all the info it needs to update the
post when published. It’s worth clicking the
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/3b3c17e974882409ebf0f715a6f4f1b3">link</a>
to see the data involved.
</li>
<li>
In WordLand, I see a
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/01/18/useWordland.png">dialog</a>
confirming that I want to write a review for Bingeworthy. If I approve,
it creates a new WordLand draft.
</li>
<li>
I write the first draft of the review and when I’m ready I publish it.
The protocol supports revisions, btw.
</li>
<li>
When the user publishes, in WordLand it builds a URL with
tv.bingeworthy.org as the destination. The post body has a JSON object
with title and content properties, both of which can contain markdown.
The URL params contain the id of the program, screenname of the user,
the token that authorizes updating the comment for the rating of this
program by this user.
</li>
<li>
On tv.bingeworthy.org, if the token agrees with the one in the database,
it updates the <i>comment</i> field of the rating,
</li>
<li>
Then tv.bingeworthy.org sends a websocket message to the author, in
Bingeworthy, so they can update the display of the rating for the user,
if they still have the program displayed on their screen.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I’ve done these kinds of protocols before, for example, menu sharing on
the Mac in the 90s and rssCloud on the web. These are increasingly
complicated things, because they require secure coordination between a
circle of programs, and allow choice in each of the nodes.
</p>
<p>
There’s nothing hard-coded about the protocol only working for this pair
of programs.
</p>
<p>
It also supports updating. And the post is also available in WordPress
and RSS, so even though it’s editable in a great editor, and displayed
in a collection of similar writing, it is also fully scattered into the
wind. And there’s no need for federation, it’s just a protocol. We don’t
even rely on the apps using the same identity system.

Are Very Different from Human Mistakes</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-21, updated: 2025-01-24, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Humans make mistakes all the time. All of us do, every day, in tasks
both new and routine. Some of our mistakes are minor and some are
catastrophic. Mistakes can break trust with our friends, lose the
confidence of our bosses, and sometimes be the difference between life
and death.
</p>
<p>
Over the millennia, we have created security systems to deal with the
sorts of mistakes humans commonly make. These days, casinos rotate their
dealers regularly, because they make mistakes if they do the same task
for too long. Hospital personnel write on limbs before surgery so that
doctors operate on the correct body part, and they count surgical
instruments to make sure none were left inside the body. From
copyediting to double-entry bookkeeping to appellate courts, we humans
have gotten really good at correcting human mistakes…

Today I want to share with you a song that has stuck with me for a
couple decades and has been a source of catharsis for shaking off that
existential dread. I’m talking about Piebald’s 2002 single <em>American
Hearts</em>.

HEY! You're part of it
YEAH! You're part of it
HEY! You're part of it

[Verse 1]
I walk the streets of a Carolina
Watching people pushing shopping carts
And there's a guy above me
And he's washing windows
Making ten bucks a pop
And he says to me...

[Hook]
HEY! You're part of it
YEAH! You're part of it
HEY! You're part of it
YEAH! You're part of it

[Verse 2]
And I say, "Sir, well have you heard that this country is unequal still?"
History continues itself
Continues itself
History continues itself
And I did not create the rules

From all I've heard
And all I've seen
This place has broken
My American heart

<p>
From the first snap of the snare to the final piano chord the song grips
you for the whole ride. The staccato bass line powers the song and
surrounds itself in an envelope of noise from the dual guitars and a
cacophony of drum hits. The lyrics and chord progressions are simple but
together they produce something bigger. The song only has two major
parts, but the way they drop instruments in and out it feels like four.
And best of all, it makes you want to punch a hole in the sky.
</p>
<p>
Every so often – out of nowhere in the middle of my day when I’m feeling
frustrated by a situation beyond my control – I’ll shout to myself “HEY!
You’re part of it” as a little mantra to remind myself that, yes, I’m a
participant in the democratic capitalist American experiment. I’m a
participant in the prosperous parts as well as the unjust parts. I’m
part of it. And due to America’s broad empire-like influence, you’re
probably part of it or impacted by it too. And it breaks your heart at
times.

<p>BTW, actually the term
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22social%20web%22">social
web</a> is probably too big a compromise. The “web” part is the only
part that’s imho useful. The sad part is that “social” means “we removed
most of the features of the web.” Why? Some vague sense that people
would write too much if given the space. Or link too much. Or edit too
much. Or be too emphatic. It’s worse than Disneyfied – at least at
Disneyland you get actors, and color and rides, and bland food with tons
of sugar and fat. But there is some fun and nutrition. In the social
web, it’s just memes and slogans. Not even much room for a metaphor.
There’s so much more to say about being human.</p>

just wrote a review for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_(TV_series)">Industry</a>
in <a href="https://tv.bingeworthy.org/">BingeWorthy</a>, but it doesn’t
have a text editor. It farms the job off to
<a href="https://this.how/wordland/">WordLand</a>, which shoots the text
back to Bingeworthy as the user publishes to WordPress and
<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a>, in Markdown.
So the text is on both BW and WP and the
<a href="https://feediverse.org/">feediverse</a>. And through WordPress
it has a
<a href="https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/01/20/industry-was-great-until-the-end/">presence
on the web</a>. This is the goal, writing exists on its own, but can be
shared in all the contexts it makes sense in, but it lives primarily in
your blog, your home base. That’s why WordPress is so important in the
scheme of things. It’s a consensus, this is where a lot of people are
blogging in 2025. And there’s a lot of mostly unexplored interop. And
they don’t break developers. This may not make total sense at this time,
but soon, I hope to be able to point back at this post, and say it was
the first time something important worked.</p>

There’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRQtjVzj1bo">great
scene</a> in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Country_for_Old_Men">No
Country For Old Men</a>, where a character is facing imminent death, but
he’s arguing with the character who will kill him, who asks if all your
great ideas led to this (his death) how good were the ideas
(paraphrasing).
</p>
<p>
Along those lines.. If Twitter was such a great idea but it led to the
death of democracy (for now at least) maybe it wasn’t such a great idea.
Maybe when we try to reboot we should try something <i>realllly</i>
different.

I have a confession to make. You probably sensed it, but weren’t able to
articulate what was happening. Your loved ones think you’re losing your
grasp on reality. For the last six months I’ve been incrementally
changing the color scheme on my website every single day. I boiled you

At the center of this CSS-trick is setting a <code>–hue</code> variable
and rotating the hue about <code>1deg</code> each day to make it 360º
around the color wheel over the year. Because I like blue, I set the
default <code>–hue</code> to <code>196</code> and add the current day’s
<code>–hue-rotate</code> value to calculate my final
<code>–rotated-hue</code> value.

The math for the <code>–hue-rotate</code> isn’t that complex, but since

the site with Jekyll.

Now my <code>–rotated-hue</code> value nudges itself every day starting
from the base hue.

Then it drops down vertically to zero and continues up at the same prior to the drop." />

<figcaption>

<p>
I put <code>–rotated-hue</code> inside an <code>hsl()</code> and it
worked okay, but was decidedly boring. I needed a way to make it more
dynamic.
</p>
<p>
The next bit of magic was to use a slightly more complicated
<code>calc()</code> function for the saturation value. Using some of the
new CSS math functions, I take the <code>cos()</code> of the
<code>–rotated-hue</code> to get a value between <code>1</code> and
<code>-1</code>, then multiply that by <code>45%</code> which is my
“base saturation” for my light mode theme. That gives me a value between
<code>-45%</code> and <code>+45%</code>, so I double it and add another
<code>45%</code> to avoid the gray zone of negative saturation.

<p>
For my dark mode I wanted a darker website, so I lowered the base
saturation to <code>25%</code> …
</p>
<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="css"><span class="k">@media</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">prefers-color-scheme</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">dark</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Astute readers will notice I don’t add the full base saturation back to
the value. This was intentional because as I slid the <code>–hue</code>
value around I came across an ugly “background radiation” zone when
<code>–rotated-hue</code> enters the green color space (h=75-115). For a
month or two my site looked like dogshit. I minimized the undesired
effect by letting it dip down into the gray in dark mode.

<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/dark-sat.svg" alt="A shallower inverted parabola starts at 0.375 and dips down to -0.125 in the middle of the year and slopes back up." />
</p>
<figcaption>
Dark mode background saturation over time
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
As you can see in the chart above, lowering the base saturation creates
a less dramatic wave function dipping below the <code>0%</code>
saturation. The resulting effect is that my light and dark mode now
share the same <code>–rotated-hue</code> but have pretty different
vibes. When I plot the two background saturations next to each other,
you can see the relationship.

If someone asked me today “What color is your website?”, I sort of love
the fact that I don’t know. In fact, I’d almost have to consult a chart
on any given day…

Ah yeah. It makes perfect sense. It’s

<h2>
Updating my accent color
</h2>
<p>
The final step was improving my accent color. Finding a static color
that had proper color contrast and worked well with every background
color was difficult. I was hoping to find a shortcut but all roads led
to making my accent color dynamic as well. How do I pick a color that
works with every color? After
<a href="https://codepen.io/davatron5000/pen/BaXpKOb?editors=0010">some
experiments</a>, I leaned heavily on some
<a href="https://razposlanse7dblearning.z21.web.core.windows.net/color-wheel-color-theory-calculator.html">third-grade
art class color theory</a>.
</p>
<p>
I found that rotating the <code>–rotated-hue</code> another 240º to get
a triadic tone on the color wheel gave the accent color the best chance
at standing out in both light and dark mode. You can see the relation to
the background and accent hue when I plot them next to each other.

<p>
I decided to use <code>oklch()</code> instead of <code>hsl()</code> for
my accent color because I wanted the vibrancy that can only come from
the <code>p3</code> color space.
</p>

<span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre>

<p>
I tinkered with picking the color by hand so that I could try and
maximize the number of days my accent color punches up into the
<code>p3</code> space.

<h2>
Rotating colors is fun but not without its challenges
</h2>
<p>
As far as challenges go, accessibility and proper color contrast is a
concern. Contrast checkers don’t work the best with <code>p3</code>, but
I’m sure that’s solvable. One challenge was my button text which I set
in <code>#FFFFFF</code> in attempt to maximize contrast. It’s not
perfect but it’s right more than its wrong. This is one place where
Safari’s CSS
<a href="https://css-tricks.com/exploring-color-contrast-for-the-first-time/"><code>color-contrast()</code></a>
would be welcome to have in all browsers.
</p>
<p>
I’ve also scoped my theme to two dynamic colors; adding more is
difficult. I re-did my syntax highlighting theme and it’s doing okay (I
used the other triadic tone), but more colors is more problems and the
complexity balloons quick. Having some shades of gray in the style of
<a href="https://open-props.style/">Open Props</a> would be helpful, so
I may pursue that.
</p>
<p>
I’m happy with how it turned out but there’s plenty of room for
improvement. I doubt I will ever stop obsessively tweaking the color
formulas to get it juuuust right. One thing that bothers me now are the
puke yellows in my accent color (like today’s) and the greens in the
background color aren’t my favorite. I’m embracing the randomness, but
I’d love
<a href="https://piccalil.li/blog/redesigning-piccalilli-the-first-part-of-the-design-process/">a
yellow like Piccalilli’s website</a>. It might be possible to bump up
the <code>oklch()</code> brightness in certain parts of the color
journey, but requires more math.
</p>
<p>
It would also be awesome to figure out how to change colors over a
custom gradient as opposed to the hue wheel. Could I use a step-frame
animation but grab a point on a conic gradient? Hm…
</p>
<p>
Was it worth it? Did anyone notice? Yes, one person noticed.
<a href="https://john.kreitlow.rocks/">My coworker John</a> is the only
person who said anything. Good eye, John.
</p>
<p>
All said and done, I like my little rotating color scheme. It’s fun
waking up and wondering what color my website is today. If you’re having
fun with color on your website I’d love to see it. I want all the
<code>p3</code> inspiration I can get.

<p>
When I was a teenager and met the first US citizens talking about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr._Day">Martin
Luther King Jr. Day</a>, I was confused. I knew nothing about this guy.
My step mother is from Angola, grew up in Portugal, and we never spoke
about the fight for civil rights.
</p>
<p>
I knew there were racists out there, but back in Switzerland I only saw
the kind of punching down that is unfortunately very common: the
children of Italian
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastarbeiter">gastarbeiters</a>,
asylum seekers from Sri Lanka, refugees from the civil war in Yugoslavia
– it was always against the newest arrivals, the lowest station on the
social ladder.
</p>
<p>
I guess that’s why it took me so long to finally read the <em>Letter
from Birmingham Jail</em>.

Don’t just read the summary on Wikipedia.

they read it every year on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. What a great
idea.

And in other news,
<a class="account" href="https://wandering.shop/@adapalmer" title="@adapalmer@wandering.shop"><span
class="citation" data-cites="adapalmer">@adapalmer</span></a> writes
about the surprising recovery of sea turtles:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
How’s this for some good news? Recent studies show that sea turtle
populations are booming worldwide. Loggerhead nests off the northwest
African coast have jumped to 35,000 in 2020 from 500 in 2008. Kemp’s
ridley nests have grown to 17,000 in 2022 from 702 in 1985, and a 2023
survey discovered 150,000 green turtle nests in New Caledonia. The
surprising reason: reduced consumption by humans. – Ada Palmer,

<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Pam+McQuesten">Pam
McQuesten</a> passed away on January 1 after a brief illness.
</p>
<p>
I
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1681058035952686/posts/1681610715897418/">knew
Pam</a> in Silicon Valley, as we were starting up Living Videotext in
1983. Our office was on
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Elwell+Ct,+Palo+Alto,+CA+94303/@37.4320011,-122.1062105,1048m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x808fba3f1e2d0db3:0x2fd030af404448b3!8m2!3d37.4320011!4d-122.1036356!16s%2Fg%2F1tgb__w0?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDExNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D">Elwell
Court</a> in Palo Alto, just off 101, near the golf course and airport.
Pam was managing editor of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_(magazine)">BYTE</a>, the
class act of tech pubs in the early personal computer business, then
editor of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Computing">Popular
Computing</a>, the magazine for the people (ie users of computers). When
she was at BYTE, her office was on the same floor as ours.
</p>
<p>
The tech industry was rough even then, all the young egos, people who
were sure they could do everything, not much collaboration, lots of
betrayal. She was one of the few people I could talk with on a personal
level, with trust and intelligence. We talked about the future of the
technology we were creating, and what we wanted from all this. She was a
mentor, like a big sister, best friend, someone I trusted and loved. A
very rare friendship.
</p>
<p>
BTW, her name in the 80s, before her marriage to Paul McQuesten, was Pam
Clark.
</p>
<p>
Our paths crossed again a few years ago on Facebook. I invited her to
join a private group I have with friends I love and trust, to share the
life I had at my “pond house” in the Catskills.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to post a brief remembrance here in case any of Pam’s friends
are tuned in, so they can be part of the
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1681058035952686">celebration

to think of what images I’ve used in the past, then I thought why don’t
I just look. I switched into Daytona, entered
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=interop">interop</a>,
and found
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/03/12/hamstercage.png">one</a>
I loved, but then kept scanning, and found
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/01/runner.png">another</a>
that I liked even more. Tools are important. Web writers haven’t gotten
any new tools in a long time. All the tool development has been for
other stuff. Let’s make tools for users again, as we did in the olden
times. Craftwork in software. Playin in the band!</p>

easy would it be to create a twitter-like app using RSS, and in what
ways would it differ from other twitter-like apps. Here’s the deal. You
need a place to write a posts and a way to read a timeline of posts.
That’s the basic functionality. To do that with RSS you would start with
a blogging app like WordPress, and a feed reader like
<a href="https://feedland.com/">FeedLand</a> or
<a href="https://netnewswire.com/">NetNewsWire</a>. Manton has
integrated the two into a single user interface at
<a href="https://micro.blog/">micro.blog</a>. I’m going to approach it
in a somewhat differently, not sure yet how it will work, but I’m
getting there. And I will offer a way for people to hook in any feed
reader they want, thus opening up innovation to tech-curious users. The
take-away is that you need to handle inbound and outbound feeds. That’s
the basics of being twitter-like.</p>

<p>Anyway, today I hooked up
<a href="https://tv.bingeworthy.org/">BingeWorthy</a> to
<a href="https://this.how/wordland/">WordLand</a>. Bingeworthy doesn’t
have a text editor, and it doesn’t need one, because when it wants to
offer a user a chance to explain their rating, like “seasons 1 and 2
were great, but season 3 sucked, but I gave it a high rating anyway,”
they can use WordLand which loves writers and strives to serve them
better and better. Why should I put a bullshit editor in a product
(Bingeworthy) that isn’t about writing. Its job is very different from
WordLand’s. Let them work together. That’s the big idea, that’s why you
bother having
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=interop">interop</a>, so
you can use more than one tool on the same data.</p>

<p>Then, I got a response from
<a href="https://x.com/nickweaver/status/1880601723330506958">Nick
Weaver</a> and the Madison story continues: “Here’s a roundabout Madison
connection for you. I started working at UW 28 years ago today as the
World Wide Web Editor in the Office of News and Public Affairs. My first
project was to implement Userland Frontier for the university news
page.” Now Nick is in
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Madison">my Madison
story</a> too. And he mentions
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=UserLand%20Frontier">Frontier</a>.
With Frontier, we not only had the internet over networks, we also had
networks on our computers because Frontier could send tasks to
scriptable apps, and get back results. So databases could be hooked up
to page layout programs, and people could use their writing tool of
choice, and didn’t have to use some teeny little excuse for an editor
provided by a company that doesn’t cater to or care about writers.
Imagine writing with software that was designed to hobble writers
instead of glorify them! That’s the horror of the world as proposed by
Mastodon, Threads, Bluesky, all of them. It’s like no one stopped to
think about what they are doing, half their product is writing, and they
suck at writing and have no plans to improve the situation. Geez Louise,
it’s as if we collectively lost our minds.</p>

posted something to my
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/feediverse.bsky.social/post/3lfywyfwlci2x">linkblog</a>
this morning that really should have been on my
<a href="http://scripting.com/">blog</a>. Here’s what it said. “Every
blog should have a nice search engine like mine. I can search for ideas
and it creates a story, like this
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Madison">search</a> for
‘Madison’ where I had love, fun, creativity, friends, youth, music,
strength, health, sex, and could see the future clearly. Best time of my
life, I had everything anyone could want. Pick another term get another
synthetic story.” Ironically, since my linkblog doesn’t flow through the
search engine, I would have lost this post. Which makes a bigger point.
All the ideas we throw into the silo’d
<a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22social%20web%22">social
web</a> are basically trash, not part of our collection, that we might
use tools in the future to find value in (as my Madison posts surely
did, for me at least).</p>
