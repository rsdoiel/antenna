<p>date: 2025-08-05, from: Pacific Island Times</p>
<p>When the Office of Public Accountability issues an audit, it’s not

reports are published? Are agencies fixing what’s broken? Is anyone held
accountable when they don’t?</p>

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Earthquakes and tsunamis in the news over the past few days are a reminder that we live on a dynamic planet with different hazards and associated response times. While tsunamis generated by large, distant earthquakes take hours to traverse the Pacific Ocean, it is important to remember that local earthquakes can also generate tsunamis &amp;#8212; but with much less warning.&lt;/p&gt;
