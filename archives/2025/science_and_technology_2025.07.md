## ArcaOS 5.1.1 released

date: 2025-02-17, from: OS News

It&#8217;s been two years since the release of ArcaOS 5.1, which was a hugely important release because it brought UEFI support to this continuation of IBM&#8217;s OS/2, ensuring longevity for the project for years to come. Since I don&#8217;t think much is known about what, exactly, Arca Noae, and eComStation before it, has access to within the licensing agreement with IBM, it&#8217;s difficult to ascertain just how much room they actually have to make changes to the code at the core of the old OS/2. Regardless, I tested ArcaOS 5.1 before and during its release, and the support for UEFI and GPT partition layouts was excellent on my machines. Almost 18 months later comes the next release in the 5.1 branch, ArcaOS 5.1.1, and as the version number implies, this isn&#8217;t another major release on the scale of 5.1. Looking at the list of changes, it mostly contains a ton of upgraded versions of various programs and tools included in ArcaOS. After some digging into some of those upgraded versions, I think I can safely say we&#8217;re looking at a ton of small bugfixes, but there are also a few other things that stand out to me as welcome changes. For instance, the changelog mentions various improvements to the installer and related tools, such as an improved method of determining the right screen resolution and font scaling during the installation. Considering I had to deal with some issues there &#8211; I think the installer UI elements were grossly oversized &#8211; this is a welcome fix. There are also &#8220;refreshed&#8221; Firefox and Thunderbird builds, although I don&#8217;t know if that means an update to the latest ESR releases, or just a rebuild of what was already shipping with ArcaOS 5.1. I never found the time around the 5.1 release to do a proper review &#8211; I was knee-deep in baby and toddler care overload at the time &#8211; but if Arca Noae is willing to provide me with a 5.1.1 copy, I should be able to actually review it now that I&#8217;m only ankle-deep in baby and toddler care overload.

## UNIX man pages

date: 2025-02-17, from: OS News

What might be somewhat more surprising though considering its research origins is that Unix almost since the very beginning had a comprehensive set of online reference documentation for all its commands, system calls, file formats, etc. These are the the manual- or man-pages. On Unix systems used interactively, the man-pages have historically always been installed, space permitting.  The way the manual pages have evolved and how they are used has changed over the decades. This set of posts is intended to give people unfamiliar with them an overview, as well as offer a review to seasoned users. ↫ Alex Bochannek Right in this first article in the series there&#8217;s an interesting observation I never stopped and thought about: because the original creators of UNIX were writing the content of man pages with the very tools they were creating for UNIX, it led to a virtuous cycle. &#8220;Unix tools were used to document Unix, improving the documentation tools themselves as well.&#8221; I tend to use the internet now to learn how specific tools and commands work, but having such detailed man pages built right into the operating system was a huge deal pre-internet.

## Did the Windows 95 setup team forget that MS-DOS can do graphics?

date: 2025-02-17, from: OS News

One of the reactions to my discussion of why Windows 95 setup used three operating systems (and oh there were many) was my explanation that an MS-DOS based setup program would be text-mode. But c’mon, MS-DOS could do graphics! Are you just a bunch of morons? Yes, MS-DOS could do graphics, in the sense that it didn’t actively prevent you from doing graphics. You were still responsible for everything yourself, though. There were no graphics primitives aside from a BIOS call to plot a single pixel. Everything else was on you, and you didn’t want to use the BIOS call to plot pixels anyway because it was slow. If you wanted any modicum of performance, you had to access the frame buffer directly. ↫ Raymond Chen And with everything the Windows 95 setup program needs that you&#8217;d have to create, you&#8217;d end up just&#8230; Developing a custom operating system in the first place. Since Microsoft already had Windows 3.x lying around, why not reuse parts of that to aid in the Windows 95 installation process? Honestly, all of it makes perfect sense, and I really don&#8217;t understand why anyone would seriously advocate for building a separate, entirely custom operating system just to install Windows 95 when Windows 3.x was right there. Of course, these days things are a little different, but Windows still loads a different operating system during its installation. It&#8217;s called the Windows Preinstallation Environment, but it&#8217;s no longer based on Windows 3.x, obviously, and instead is a cut-down version of the Windows version you&#8217;re actually installing. The latest version of Windows PE is 10.0.26100.1, and it&#8217;s built from Windows 11 24H2. Windows PE also powers the Windows Recovery Environment, the menu you can boot into to perform various analyses, maintenance, and repair of your Windows installation. Since Microsoft does not want Windows PE to be used a general purpose operating system, it comes with a few interesting limitations you can&#8217;t really circumvent. It has a non-configurable 72-hour time bomb, after which if will just shut off, and since PE runs entirely in memory, no changes are saved &#8211; unless you make any changes during the creation of the PE image. It also makes use of FAT32, so there&#8217;s a whole host of limitations there, and there&#8217;s a few other things Microsoft disabled. Since you an add drivers to a PE image, though, I wonder if you could sneak in a file system driver and circumvent FAT32&#8217;s limitations that way?
