Mesoscale Discussion 0397
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0333 PM CDT Fri Apr 04 2025

Areas affected...Northeast TX...southeast OK...western AR

Concerning...Tornado Watch 113...114...

Valid 042033Z - 042200Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 113, 114 continues.

SUMMARY...Maturing supercells will pose an increasing tornado threat
this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Multiple supercells have developed over the last hour
across northeast TX, in the immediate vicinity of a slow-moving cold
front that extends from southeast OK into central TX. The 18Z SHV
sounding is representative of the environment across the region,
with very rich low-level moisture, large to extreme MLCAPE,
deep-layer shear sufficient for supercells, and a rather strong
low-level jet. 

A corridor of increasing short-term tornado threat is evident from
northeast TX into far southeast OK and western AR, where locally
backed surface winds are resulting in 0-1 km SRH of 150-250 m2/s2.
This combination of favorable buoyancy, boundary-layer moisture, and
relatively strong low-level shear/SRH will support an increasing
tornado threat with any sustained supercells, including significant
(EF2+) tornado potential. Large hail and damaging winds could also
accompany the strongest cells.

Mesoscale Discussion 0396
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0329 PM CDT Fri Apr 04 2025

Areas affected...southern Kentucky and northern Tennessee

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 042029Z - 042300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...60 percent

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms are expected to increase in coverage and
intensity through the afternoon across the area.  Convective trends
will be monitored for the possibility of a watch.

DISCUSSION...Warm sector convection has slowly deepened with time
with some intensification of cells as they cross over the stationary
front in southeastern Kentucky.  Updraft intensity so far has been
muted by a warm layer around 700 mb, but additional destabilization
and subtle height falls into the evening should result in more
robust updraft development over the next few hours.  Modest
low-level shear (per local VWPs) should support some tornado
potential, especially along the surface boundary, but damaging winds
and hail should be the primary threats with the strongest storms. 
With storm motion predominantly to the northeast, storms will
eventually cross to the cool side of the boundary, resulting in hail
being the primary threat and eventual weakening of storms.  The
coverage and intensity of storms will be monitored regarding the
need for a watch.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0259 PM CDT Fri Apr 04 2025

Valid 042000Z - 051200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ARKLATEX TO
SOUTHEAST MISSOURI...

...SUMMARY...
Several clusters of severe storms are expected from central Texas
across the ArkLaTex and into the lower Ohio Valley through tonight.
The greatest threat for tornadoes, large hail and damaging winds
will be from the ArkLaTex across western Arkansas into southeast
Missouri, including potential for strong to potentially intense
tornadoes.

...20z Update...
Morning and early afternoon observations show the frontal zone
gradually expanding north/northwest from the ArkLaTex to the mid MS
and lower OH Valleys. As strong mid-level flow overlaps with the
destabilizing air mass, several clusters of severe thunderstorms
appear are ongoing and are likely to continue, with a risk for all
hazards into tonight. Minor changes were made to the northern end of
the outlook area, in accordance with the latest
observations/guidance.

...ArkLaTex...
The primary surface-based convective band, forming along and east of
the surface front from northeast TX to southern AR should continue
intensify with several supercells likely emerging and tracking
through the MDT Risk Corridor. Additional, more isolated storms are
possible within a pre-frontal confluence axis and across the warm
sector this afternoon. The 18z SHV and LZK soundings show very
favorable thermodynamic profiles, with considerable low-level
hodograph curvature (ESRH 330-500 m2/s2) and deep-layer shear
supportive for intense supercells. With observed and forecast STP of
5+, several tornadoes, some of which may be strong to intense appear
likely into this evening. The primary limiting factor for higher
probabilities continues to be the more meridional and front parallel
flow near the baroclinic zone. The numerous storm interactions
should favor upscale growth as a QLCS gradually emerges later this
afternoon/evening.

...Lower OH and TN valley...
Weak convective development within the broader warm sector has been
noted early this afternoon across parts of TN and southern KY.
Strong diurnal heating amid 70s F surface dewpoints and steep
low-level lapse rates may allow these storms to slowly intensify
through the afternoon. Displaced from the deeper ascent near the
front, storm coverage and organization are expected to be somewhat
less than farther southwest. Still, 40+ kt of effective shear with
modestly large clockwise curved hodographs suggests some potential
for supercellular activity, with a risk for damaging gusts, hail,
and a couple tornadoes.

The greater severe concern is expected later tonight as upscale
growth from the convection over the MS Valley moves eastward. A QLCS
with embedded supercellular elements appears likely across parts of
western KY and TN into central KY and southern OH. Damaging gusts
and tornadoes are expected. Given the robust destabilization now
ongoing south of the warm front, have opted to expand the SLGT and
the ENH farther east across KY and TN for a damaging wind and
tornado threat.

...West TX...
Model guidance continues to show a broad area of elevated convection
developing after dark. Significant hail and some damaging winds are
possible with elevated supercells tracking north from the Edwards
Plateau toward the Red River tonight.

..Lyons.. 04/04/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1129 AM CDT Fri Apr 04 2025/

...ArkLaTex to the lower OH Valley through tonight...
An amplified midlevel trough over the Southwest will move slowly
eastward, while embedded/subtle speed maxima eject northeastward
over the southern Plains.  Additionally, large-scale ascent will be
enhanced within the right-entrance region of the upper jet over the
upper Midwest.  At the surface, a baroclinic zone is expected to
move northward today across AR/western TN/KY in response to a weak
wave developing northeastward from northeast TX toward northwest AR
this afternoon and southeast MO tonight.  The depth of the cool air
at LZK diminished substantially from 00z to 12z, which supports
northward mixing of the front and warm sector this afternoon.

Within the surface warm sector, a very moist air mass is in place
with low 70s boundary-layer dewpoints beneath midlevel lapse rates
of 7.5-8.5 C/km.  Daytime heating in cloud breaks will contribute to
MLCAPE of 2000-3000 J/kg and weakening convective inhibition by
early-mid afternoon, when thunderstorm development is expected both
along the surface front and in the open warm sector.  Storm
development will be most concentrated along the front where ascent
will be focused and training storms are likely.  More isolated
storms will also be possible farther east in the warm sector from AR
into western TN/KY by mid-late afternoon.  Deep-layer vertical
shear/hodograph length will be favorable for supercells, with
substantial low-level hodograph curvature (effective SRH near or
above 300 m2/s2, especially near and just southeast of the front in
AR).  Given the fairly strong low-level shear and a relatively moist
environment in the low levels, supercells will be capable of
producing a few strong (EF2-EF3) tornadoes this afternoon into this
evening in the Moderate risk area.  Otherwise, very large hail to
baseball size and damaging gusts will be possible with the
supercells and embedded/organized storm clusters training along the
baroclinic zone.  North of the front, organized storms will be
capable of producing large hail and occasional damaging gusts.

...Edwards Plateau to north TX late tonight...
Similar to the previous two nights, another round of elevated
thunderstorms is expected near and after 06z from the Edwards
Plateau into north TX and perhaps southeast OK.  The storm
environment will be favorable for both elevated supercells with very
large hail and bowing clusters with some potential for damaging
winds to the surface.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0229 PM CDT Fri Apr 04 2025

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE SOUTHEAST AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...

...SUMMARY...
A wind-damage and isolated tornado threat will be likely on Sunday
across parts of the Southeast and southern Appalachians. Marginally
severe wind gusts will also be possible in parts of the southern
Appalachians, Carolinas, and Mid-Atlantic.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level jet streak will shift east from the ArkLaTex to the
Appalachians during the day Sunday with some amplification of the
broader scale mid-level trough by the end of the period. A surface
front will also shift east through the period with a weak surface
low forecast to move along this boundary from MS/AL Sunday morning
to the Carolinas by Sunday night. A moist airmass will be in place
ahead of this front which should result in some severe weather
threat from southeast Mississippi to Georgia and the Florida
Panhandle. 

...Southeast/Southern Appalachians...
A line of thunderstorms will be ongoing at the beginning of the
period from eastern Tennessee to southeast Louisiana. Instability
should be relatively weak ahead of this line Sunday morning except
for where upper 60s to low 70s dewpoints remain. This will initially
be from central Alabama southward and perhaps expanding into parts
of northern Georgia during the afternoon. Expansive cloudcover in a
moist/weak lapse rate environment should limit additional
destabilization. However, there should be sufficient instability for
maintaining ongoing convection, potentially with some embedded
supercells. Severe wind gusts and a tornado or two will be the
primary threat. 

...Southern Appalachians/Carolinas/Mid-Atlantic...
A large MCS will likely be ongoing west of the Appalachians at the
beginning of the period. The combination of the terrain, and a drier
airmass along and east of the Appalachians will likely result in
this line of storms weakening on Sunday morning. Some moistening and
at least marginal heating through the cloud cover could result in
some weak destabilization east of the Appalachians. A few strong to
isolated severe storms will be possible from the Carolinas into the
Mid-Atlantic as a mid-level jet streak overspreads the region and
the low-level jet intensifies.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1213 PM CDT Fri Apr 04 2025

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM EAST TEXAS
TO MIDDLE TENNESSEE...

...SUMMARY...
Severe storms, capable of producing damaging wind gusts, large hail
and several tornadoes are expected from Saturday into Saturday night
from the Sabine River Valley northeastward into the lower to mid
Mississippi and Ohio Valleys. Strong tornadoes, very large hail, and
severe gusts above 70 mph will be possible in parts of the lower to
mid Mississippi Valley.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level jet streak, situated near the southern axis of the
mid-level trough across northern New Mexico will shift northeastward
through the day and will be centered over Arkansas by 12Z Sunday. An
elongated surface frontal zone will run parallel to this deep-layer
flow from South Texas to the Mid-Mississippi Valley. A weak surface
low is forecast to develop along this frontal zone and move
northeast through the day Saturday. Large hail, severe wind gusts,
and tornadoes are possible along and southeast of this surface front
during the day Saturday and into Saturday night. 

...East Texas into Middle Tennessee...
Widespread convection is anticipated Saturday morning along the
frontal zone from northeast Texas into the Ohio Valley. This
convection should reinforce the cold air north of the front which
may result in it continuing to move south through the day. This is a
complicating factor to the overall forecast which could limit the
longevity of surface based storms and thus the overall severe
weather threat closer to the front from southern Arkansas into
western Tennessee and northern Mississippi. The HRRR and other CAM
guidance develops a strong enough surface wave along the front from
mid-morning to early afternoon which stalls and/or results in a
slight northward shift of the frontal zone by early afternoon. This
would result in longer residence time for any surface based storms
and at least some window for a strong tornado threat. However,
guidance has trended weaker with the surface wave over the last
several runs with slightly slower ejection of the mid-level jet max.
Therefore, am not confident that the front will stall/lift north,
with a preferred solution similar to the NAM which shows a continual
southeast movement of the frontal zone through the day Saturday. 

Farther southwest, frontal orientation across east Texas should be
more supportive for surface-based supercells along and perhaps east
of the front. Therefore, have expanded 10% tornado probabilities
farther southwest to address this threat. A line of storms with
embedded supercells will continue southeast through the evening and
into the overnight hours across Louisiana and eventually into
Mississippi. The greatest significant tornado threat will likely be
associated with any storms which can remain more discrete, ahead of
the primary frontal development. 

...Ohio Valley into parts of the central Appalachians...
The severe weather threat from western Kentucky to southern
Pennsylvania and western Maryland remains very conditional on
overnight/morning convection from the Day 1 period. 12Z guidance
varies greatly in the expansiveness of these thunderstorms tonight
with stratiform rain and a stable airmass depicted by the HRRR with
the NAM indicating minimal thunderstorm activity from northern
Kentucky and southern Ohio eastward which will permit some
instability and given the shear, potential for some severe weather
threat Saturday afternoon. A slight/marginal risk seems appropriate
to handle this conditional threat with some modifications likely
once Day 1 convective evolution becomes more apparent.

Areas affected...parts of nern OK...nrn AR...sern KS...srn and cntrl
MO

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 112...

Valid 041206Z - 041400Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 112
continues.

SUMMARY...The risk for severe hail is expected to lessen with time
as an evolving cluster of thunderstorms overspreads southern into
central Missouri through 9-11 AM CDT.  A new severe weather watch
probably will not be needed, but trends will continue to be
monitored.

DISCUSSION...Rapid east-northeastward progression of the
lower/mid-tropospheric forcing for ascent and associated stronger
convective development, near the leading edge of northward returning
plume of elevated mixed layer air, continues.  Through 14-16Z, the
primary clustering of thunderstorm activity appears likely to
overspread areas near and south of the Missouri Interstate 44
corridor, toward the Greater St. Louis vicinity.  This is getting
further removed from the stalled, sharp surface frontal zone now
across/just south of the Memphis through Texarkana vicinities. 
However, models suggest that moisture return above the cold
surface-based air is maintaining inflow of air characterized by CAPE
in excess of 1000 J/kg.   

With convection continuing to consolidate into less discrete
elements the risk for severe hail seems likely to lessen with
northeastward progression.  A few gusts approaching severe limits
have recently been observed to the southeast of Tulsa.  However,
barring the development of a more substantive surface pressure
perturbation, which may not be out of the question, but seems low in
probability, the risk for severe surface gusts probably will not
increase.

Mesoscale Discussion 0382
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0343 PM CDT Thu Apr 03 2025

Areas affected...Northeast TX into northwest LA and southern AR

Concerning...Tornado Watch 109...

Valid 032043Z - 032215Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 109 continues.

SUMMARY...Storm intensification is possible by late afternoon.
Tornadic supercells remain possible near/south of the front, in
addition to a threat of severe hail and wind.

DISCUSSION...Some increase in deep convection has been noted across
northeast TX, along and south/east of an outflow-reinforced surface
front draped from northern MS into southern AR and northeast TX. The
environment remains quite favorable for tornadic supercells within
the warm sector in this region, with the 19Z SHV sounding depicting
MLCAPE in excess of 3000 J/kg, 60 kt of effective shear, and 0-1 km
SRH of greater than 200 m2/s2. However, in the absence of stronger
large-scale ascent, it remains uncertain if any supercells can
mature prior to moving to the cool side of the surface front. Any
sustained surface-based supercells could pose some threat of
significant (EF2+) tornadoes within this environment. Otherwise, a
threat for severe hail (possibly greater than 2 inches in diameter)
and damaging wind will accompany any supercells (surface-based or
elevated) within this regime.

Mesoscale Discussion 0381
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0331 PM CDT Thu Apr 03 2025

Areas affected...Portions of West Virginia and northern Virginia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 032031Z - 032300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Storms moving into West Virginia may pose a threat of
severe weather this afternoon and evening.  Convective trends will
continue to be monitored, although a watch appears unlikely at this
time.

DISCUSSION...Despite midlevel height rises across the area,
low-level warm-air advection continues to support thunderstorm
development across eastern Kentucky.  The storms are expected to
continue moving eastward across West Virginia, though high clouds
and poorer boundary-layer moisture (per 18Z RNK sounding) have
limited destabilization.  With low-level flow (and attendant warm
advection) forecast to increase into the evening, there is a threat
for the convection to persist.  Given the sufficient low-level and
deep-layer shear across the area, these storms will have the
potential to produce damaging winds, hail, and a tornado. Trends
will be monitored through the evening, but a watch appears to be
unlikely at this time.

Mesoscale Discussion 0379
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0211 PM CDT Thu Apr 03 2025

Areas affected...eastern Kentucky

Concerning...Tornado Watch 107...

Valid 031911Z - 032115Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 107 continues.

SUMMARY...Storms across eastern Kentucky continue to pose a threat
of damaging winds, hail, and tornadoes this afternoon.

DISCUSSION...Sustained low-level warm-air advection continues to
support thunderstorms across eastern Kentucky.  Afternoon insolation
and a narrow axis of better moisture (upper 60s dewpoints) extending
into eastern Kentucky have resulted in MLCAPE values approaching
1000 J/kg. The deep-layer flow and shear (over 50 kts per
mesoanalysis and local VWPs) are more than sufficient for organized
storm modes.  Currently, the dominant convective mode of north-south
oriented bands along the differential heating zone seems to favor
severe-wind potential at this time; however, the strong low-level
shear would support tornado potential pending a more favorable
convective mode.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 107
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1250 PM CDT Thu Apr 3 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Eastern Arkansas
  South-central and Southeast Kentucky
  Northern Mississippi
  Western and Middle Tennessee

* Effective this Thursday afternoon and evening from 1250 PM
  until 1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes likely with a couple intense tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Scattered large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...Severe storms including supercells are expected to develop
this afternoon near a boundary that extends generally
southwest-to-northeast across the region. A moist environment and
strong low-level shear will support tornado potential aside from
damaging winds and hail. The severe/tornado risk could persist well
through the evening.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 50 statute miles
north and south of a line from 65 miles southwest of Memphis TN to
15 miles southeast of Jackson KY. For a complete depiction of the
watch see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU7).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.

&&

AVIATION...Tornadoes and a few severe thunderstorms with hail
surface and aloft to 1.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind
gusts to 60 knots. A few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 550. Mean
storm motion vector 23035.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1136 AM CDT Thu Apr 03 2025

Valid 031700Z - 041200Z

Eastern extent of Elevated highlights in portions of eastern New
Mexico and the far western Texas Panhandle was trimmed slightly back
to the west. This is to account for recent precipitation and
considerably higher relative humidity, which should continue to
overspread far eastern New Mexico from portions northwestern Texas
through the day. Otherwise, the previous forecast (see below)
remains on track.

..Squitieri/Williams.. 04/03/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0151 AM CDT Thu Apr 03 2025/

...Synopsis...
Within the base of a highly amplified large-scale trough over the
West, a 70-80-kt midlevel southwesterly speed maximum will emerge
over the southern High Plains. In response, a weak lee cyclone will
develop over southeast CO, while another broad/weak surface cyclone
forms along the tail end of a front south of the TX Big Bend. Aided
by downslope flow and diurnal heating on the western edge of
increasing cloud coverage, a corridor of 15-20 percent RH will
develop from southern NM northeastward to far southeast CO. Here,
around 15-20 mph sustained southwesterly surface winds will favor
elevated fire-weather conditions. Locally elevated fire-weather
conditions are also possible over the TX Big Bend, where dry/breezy
conditions are expected north of the surface cyclone.

Mesoscale Discussion 0375
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0638 AM CDT Thu Apr 03 2025

Areas affected...north Texas and southeast OK

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 106...

Valid 031138Z - 031345Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 106
continues.

SUMMARY...Elevated cells will continue to pose a large hail risk
this morning across portions of north Texas into southeast Oklahoma.

DISCUSSION...A couple of strong, elevated supercells across western
north TX will continue to shift east through the morning. This
activity is occurring in a warm advection regime atop a stalled
surface boundary draped across north/north-central Texas eastward to
the AR/LA border. Steep midlevel lapse rates are contributing to
modest elevated instability, with MUCAPE values around 1000-2000
J/kg noted in latest mesoanalysis. Additional cells may develop
within this regime through the morning hours and large hail
potential may persist beyond the 13z expiration time of Severe
Thunderstorm Watch 106. Some severe potential also could persist
downstream of the current watch, though north and east extent is
somewhat uncertain. A new watch, or a local watch extension will
likely be needed in the next hour or so.

Areas affected...portions of western to east-central MO

Concerning...Tornado Watch 94...96...

Valid 021217Z - 021415Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 94, 96 continues.

SUMMARY...Strong/damaging gusts and a couple of tornadoes remain
possible across WW 94 and 96 over west-central MO. A downstream
watch may be needed later this morning, though timing is uncertain.

DISCUSSION...Strong to severe thunderstorms continue near a surface
cold front across western MO this morning. Boundary layer moistening
is slowly occurring as an intense low-level jet streams over the
area, contributing to enlarged, looping hodographs. Some rotation
has been noted amid the somewhat messy storm mode early this
morning. Capping and weaker instability with eastward extent likely
is tempering severe potential somewhat, but isolated strong gusts, a
couple of tornadoes and sporadic large hail remain possible. This
convection will continue to propagate eastward through the morning
and some potential for a downstream watch into east-central MO
exists. However, timing is uncertain as destabilization is expected
to be more modest across eastern MO through the morning hours.
Trends will continue to be monitored.

Mesoscale Discussion 0349

Areas affected...northeast OK into extreme southwest MO/northwest AR

Concerning...Tornado Watch 95...96...

Valid 021157Z - 021400Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 95, 96 continues.

SUMMARY...Damaging wind and tornado potential may be maximized
across northeast Oklahoma into extreme southwest Missouri/northwest
Arkansas over the next couple of hours.

DISCUSSION...Recent radar trends have shows some propensity for
linear convection to become more supercellular. This activity is
moving across the max STP corridor (effective layer STP around 5-7)
amid strong vertical shear and moderate instability. While some
rotation has been occurring, and even a brief TDS was noted over
Tulsa and Rogers Counties in northeast OK, capping and storm motion
parallel to the surface front is likely limiting the longevity of
stronger/better organized cells within the broader line of
convection. Nevertheless, a couple of tornadoes, damaging gusts and
isolated large hail remain possible this morning.

Mesoscale Discussion 0348
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0615 AM CDT Wed Apr 02 2025

Areas affected...portions of North Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 021115Z - 021315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated gusty winds and marginal hail to near 1 inch
possible this morning. Overall risk is expected to remain low and a
watch is not expected.

DISCUSSION...Elevated convection has developed along an
eastward-advancing cold front across western north Texas this
morning. Mid-60s dewpoints beneath steep midlevel lapse rates are
contributing to strong MLCAPE amid intense vertical shear. Capping
and modest linear forcing associated with the cold front will likely
preclude greater severe potential despite the favorable
thermodynamic and kinematic parameter space. Nevertheless, isolated
gusty winds and perhaps hail to near 1 inch diameter will be
possible. Watch issuance is not currently expected, but radar trends
will continue to be monitored through the morning.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 96
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
520 AM CDT Wed Apr 2 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  Northwest Arkansas
  Far Southeast Kansas
  Southwest and Central Missouri
  Eastern Oklahoma

* Effective this Wednesday morning from 520 AM until NOON CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  A few tornadoes and a couple intense tornadoes possible
  Scattered damaging winds likely with isolated significant gusts
    to 75 mph possible
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
