Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0750 AM CDT Tue Apr 01 2025

Valid 011300Z - 021200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE SOUTHERN/CENTRAL PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Rapid, intense thunderstorm development should occur this evening
over parts of the central/southern Plains. A few supercells with a
risk for very large hail and strong tornadoes appear possible,
particularly across north-central Oklahoma into eastern Kansas. A
line of thunderstorms should also develop and pose a threat for
severe/damaging winds across eastern Kansas into western Missouri
tonight.

...Synopsis...
Upper troughing over the western CONUS will undergo amplification
today as multiple embedded mid-level shortwave troughs move
east-northeastward across the Southwest and into the
central/northern Plains. A pronounced southwesterly mid-level jet
will also overspread the southern/central Plains this evening and
overnight. Low-level moisture centered around 850 mb has been
streaming northward this morning across TX in association with a
strong southerly low-level jet. Surface dewpoints have also been
increasing across the Rio Grande Valley into south-central TX. This
trend is expected to continue through the day, as a surface low
deepens as it develops from eastern CO into western KS through the
afternoon. This low is forecast to further develop/reform across
southwest KS into northwest OK as ascent associated with the
mid-level jet overspreads the High Plains. A dryline will extend
southward from this low across western OK into northwest TX. A cold
front is expected to sweep east-southeastward over much of the
central Plains and southern High Plains overnight, as the surface
low develops northeastward towards eastern NE/western IA by early
Wednesday morning.

...Central Plains into Missouri...
It appears likely that the cap will erode over the central High
Plains by late afternoon or early evening. At least isolated
thunderstorms are expected to develop near the triple point in the
south-central KS/north-central OK vicinity, and subsequently spread
quickly northeastward. Moderate to locally strong instability,
coupled with 50-60 kt of effective bulk shear, will easily support
supercells, with an associated threat for very large hail (up to 2-3
inches in diameter). As the southerly low-level jet markedly
increases this evening, hodographs will enlarge and become
elongated, with ample effective SRH to support tornadoes with any
sustained supercells. Given the strength of the low-level flow
expected (50-60+ kt southerly jet at 850 mb) and degree of low-level
shear forecast, strong tornadoes appear possible. A line of
convection should also erupt along the cold front in north-central
to northeast KS tonight, and spread eastward into parts of western
MO through early Wednesday morning. Even with the time of night, the
overall environment appears quite favorable for severe/damaging
winds, including the potential for isolated 75+ mph gusts. The
Enhanced Risk has been expanded east-northeastward some across
eastern KS into western MO to account for this scenario.

...Southern Plains...
There is somewhat less confidence in convective initiation farther
south into central/southern OK and western north TX late this
afternoon and early evening. While low-level moisture will be
greater across this area compared to locations farther north, with
related stronger instability, large-scale ascent is forecast to be a
bit weaker/delayed. Even so, a very favorable thermodynamic and
kinematic environment will exist across this region, with MLCAPE
ranging generally 2000-3000 J/kg by late afternoon, and 50+ kt of
effective bulk shear present. Any supercell that initiates along the
dryline, and which can be sustained into the early evening, would
pose a risk for both very large hail and a strong tornado. While
overall thunderstorm coverage may be more isolated with southward
extent in OK, have opted to expand the Enhanced Risk southwestward
along the I-44/I-35 corridors to account for an intense supercell or
two which could form. Another round of severe convection may develop
late tonight into early Wednesday morning as the cold front surges
east-southeastward. Severe/damaging winds should be the main threat
with this activity if it forms. But, given the strong low-level
shear and ample MUCAPE forecast, tornadoes and perhaps large hail
will also be a concern with any embedded supercells.

...Central Valley of California...
With cold air aloft associated with the upper trough over the
western CONUS, weak instability could develop by peak afternoon
heating to support isolated strong thunderstorms. These could pose a
risk for small hail, gusty winds, and perhaps a brief tornado or two
across portions of the Central Valley in CA.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0357 AM CDT Tue Apr 01 2025

Valid 041200Z - 091200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Amplified mid-level flow and deep moisture south of a quasi
stationary frontal zone will persist over much of the central and
eastern CONUS through the first half of the extended forecast
period. Models are in generally good agreement with the progression
of the pattern and the potential for severe storms. However, some
key differences, and days of preceding convection will modulate
potential in the coming days.

...Day4/Friday...
The broad upper trough over the western US is forecast to gradually
deepen Friday into the weekend, as an upper low forms over northern
Mexico. Flow aloft will become increasingly southerly over the
southern Plains while it curves anticyclonically over the Mid South
and eastern US. A rich pool of deep moisture will continue to reside
along a quasi stationary frontal zone from the Red River to the OH
Valley. Several clusters of strong to severe storms appear possible
within the broadly favorable zone of weak ascent and large
buoyancy/shear. The surface picture remains very complicated due to
multiple preceding days of convective potential.

...Day5/Saturday...
The primary mid-level impulse will begin to eject across northern
Mexico, eventually reaching the lower/middle MS Valley D5/Saturday.
Model differences begin to emerge on the latitudinal extent of the
warm sector owing to differences in the timing/structure of the
ejecting upper cyclone. Regardless, continued southerly low-level
flow will replenish deep moisture over much of the ArkLaTex and
Southeastern US. A surface low and cold front will gradually
intensify across the Mid South, likely focusing severe potential
ahead of it. The intensity of the severe risk will likely be tied to
ongoing storms from the prior Day 4, but supercells are possible
from east TX into the MS Valley and parts of the Southeast into
Saturday night.

...Day6-8...
The cold front and low will continue to move eastward with the upper
trough through the end of the weekend and into early next week. Some
severe risk could emerge over parts of the Southeast/eastern US with
seasonably high moisture and instability. However, model differences
on the frontal timing and the potential for multiple rounds of
proceeding convection make severe potential very uncertain beyond
Day 5.

Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 85
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
445 AM CDT Mon Mar 31 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northern and Central Alabama
  Far Northwest Georgia
  Northeast Mississippi

* Effective this Monday morning from 445 AM until NOON CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Isolated large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Multiple lines and clusters of thunderstorms are expected
to spread eastward this morning across much of northern/central
Alabama and into far northwest Georgia. Scattered severe/damaging
winds should be the main threat with this activity, although
isolated hail and perhaps a tornado or two may also occur.

statute miles east and west of a line from 25 miles northeast of
Huntsville AL to 20 miles south southwest of Selma AL. For a
complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU5).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

of Evergreen AL to 30 miles southeast of Mobile AL. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU6).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...
