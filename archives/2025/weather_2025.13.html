Mesoscale Discussion 0375
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0638 AM CDT Thu Apr 03 2025

Areas affected...north Texas and southeast OK

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 106...

Valid 031138Z - 031345Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 106
continues.

SUMMARY...Elevated cells will continue to pose a large hail risk
this morning across portions of north Texas into southeast Oklahoma.

DISCUSSION...A couple of strong, elevated supercells across western
north TX will continue to shift east through the morning. This
activity is occurring in a warm advection regime atop a stalled
surface boundary draped across north/north-central Texas eastward to
the AR/LA border. Steep midlevel lapse rates are contributing to
modest elevated instability, with MUCAPE values around 1000-2000
J/kg noted in latest mesoanalysis. Additional cells may develop
within this regime through the morning hours and large hail
potential may persist beyond the 13z expiration time of Severe
Thunderstorm Watch 106. Some severe potential also could persist
downstream of the current watch, though north and east extent is
somewhat uncertain. A new watch, or a local watch extension will
likely be needed in the next hour or so.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0732 AM CDT Thu Apr 03 2025

Valid 031300Z - 041200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PARTS OF
THE ARKLATEX INTO THE MID-SOUTH AND MIDDLE TENNESSEE...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are likely today along/near a frontal zone from
the southern Plains into the lower Mississippi and Tennessee
Valleys. The most concentrated corridor for severe potential should
be focused from the Arklatex into western/middle Tennessee, where
very large hail and a few strong tornadoes are possible.

...Southern Plains into the Lower Mississippi Valley/Mid-South and
Southern Mid-Atlantic...
Within broad upper troughing over the western CONUS, ascent
associated with an embedded mid-level shortwave trough has
encouraged multiple elevated supercells across west into
north-central TX this morning along/north of a surface front. These
thunderstorms are also being aided with continued moisture transport
by a southerly low-level jet. With ample MUCAPE along/north of the
front, steep mid-level lapse rates, and strong cloud-layer shear all
present, these supercells should continue to pose a threat for
mainly large to perhaps very large hail for at least a couple more
hours. By late morning to early afternoon, thunderstorm interactions
and mergers may gradually reduce the severe hail threat north of the
front across OK/TX into AR.

With neutral to slightly rising mid-level heights, the convectively
reinforced front is forecast to move little today across the
ArkLaTex, Mid-South, and TN Valley. Ongoing convection this morning
across middle/eastern TN into eastern KY may pose an isolated severe
threat in the short term. But, most of this activity has outpaced
greater low-level moisture to the southwest, and/or has become
slightly elevated to the north of the front. Even though large-scale
ascent will tend to remain nebulous/weak across these areas,
persistent low-level warm advection should aid in renewed
thunderstorm development along/near the stalled front through the
afternoon and evening. Any convection which can form on or just
south of this boundary will have a rather favorably moist low-level
airmass, steep lapse rates aloft, and strong deep-layer shear to
support organized updrafts. Large to very large hail will be a
threat with supercells that are forecast to develop, and a tornado
threat will likely exist with any convection that can remain surface
based/to the warm side of the front. With rather strong low-level
shear forecast, a conditionally favorable environment will exist for
strong tornadoes, with continued uncertainty whether supercells this
afternoon/evening will be mainly surface based, or slightly elevated
north of the front.

Across the central Appalachians and southern Mid-Atlantic, remnants
of convection and related outflow boundaries from earlier this
morning should tend to serve as a northern limit to any appreciable
severe threat today. Some adjustments have been made to the Marginal
and Slight Risk areas to account for this. Overall thunderstorm
coverage and intensity remain rather uncertain across these regions
later this afternoon and evening, with some guidance still showing
isolated thunderstorms redeveloping. If any convection can form
along/south of the front later today, then it could pose some threat
for hail and damaging winds.

Finally, elevated supercells are forecast to develop once again late
tonight into early Friday morning across parts of west into
north-central TX. These should mainly have a severe hail threat.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0322 AM CDT Thu Apr 03 2025

Valid 061200Z - 111200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Models are in relatively good agreement for the Sunday/D4 to
Monday/D5 period, depicting an elongating upper trough sweeping east
from the OH/TN Valleys to the East Coast.

On Sunday/D4, a leading midlevel wave is forecast to move out of AR
and across TN/KY, with little amplitude and poor lapse rates by this
time. An extensive area of rain and thunderstorms will be ongoing
along the length of the cold front throughout the day, from the
Northeast to the northern Gulf Coast. Some severe wind threat is
expected, mainly over parts of the Southeast where dewpoints will be
higher and as deep-layer shear remains favorable.

The trend of widespread precipitation along this front will continue
into early Monday/D5, from the Carolinas into FL. The severe risk
should continue to dwindle as large-scale support weakens, but
low-end potential cannot be ruled out over these areas.

For the Tuesday/D6 to Thursday/D8 time frame, the weather pattern
will be much less conducive to severe storms, with a ridge building
over the West, and northwest flow across the central states.
Periodic surges of high pressure are forecast, helping to keep
conditions mostly stable over the bulk of the CONUS.

Mesoscale Discussion 0350
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0717 AM CDT Wed Apr 02 2025

Areas affected...portions of western to east-central MO

Concerning...Tornado Watch 94...96...

Valid 021217Z - 021415Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 94, 96 continues.

SUMMARY...Strong/damaging gusts and a couple of tornadoes remain
possible across WW 94 and 96 over west-central MO. A downstream
watch may be needed later this morning, though timing is uncertain.

DISCUSSION...Strong to severe thunderstorms continue near a surface
cold front across western MO this morning. Boundary layer moistening
is slowly occurring as an intense low-level jet streams over the
area, contributing to enlarged, looping hodographs. Some rotation
has been noted amid the somewhat messy storm mode early this
morning. Capping and weaker instability with eastward extent likely
is tempering severe potential somewhat, but isolated strong gusts, a
couple of tornadoes and sporadic large hail remain possible. This
convection will continue to propagate eastward through the morning
and some potential for a downstream watch into east-central MO
exists. However, timing is uncertain as destabilization is expected
to be more modest across eastern MO through the morning hours.
Trends will continue to be monitored.

Areas affected...northeast OK into extreme southwest MO/northwest AR

Concerning...Tornado Watch 95...96...

Valid 021157Z - 021400Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 95, 96 continues.

SUMMARY...Damaging wind and tornado potential may be maximized
across northeast Oklahoma into extreme southwest Missouri/northwest
Arkansas over the next couple of hours.

DISCUSSION...Recent radar trends have shows some propensity for
linear convection to become more supercellular. This activity is
moving across the max STP corridor (effective layer STP around 5-7)
amid strong vertical shear and moderate instability. While some
rotation has been occurring, and even a brief TDS was noted over
Tulsa and Rogers Counties in northeast OK, capping and storm motion
parallel to the surface front is likely limiting the longevity of
stronger/better organized cells within the broader line of
convection. Nevertheless, a couple of tornadoes, damaging gusts and
isolated large hail remain possible this morning.

Mesoscale Discussion 0348
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0615 AM CDT Wed Apr 02 2025

Areas affected...portions of North Texas

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 021115Z - 021315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated gusty winds and marginal hail to near 1 inch
possible this morning. Overall risk is expected to remain low and a
watch is not expected.

DISCUSSION...Elevated convection has developed along an
eastward-advancing cold front across western north Texas this
morning. Mid-60s dewpoints beneath steep midlevel lapse rates are
contributing to strong MLCAPE amid intense vertical shear. Capping
and modest linear forcing associated with the cold front will likely
preclude greater severe potential despite the favorable
thermodynamic and kinematic parameter space. Nevertheless, isolated
gusty winds and perhaps hail to near 1 inch diameter will be
possible. Watch issuance is not currently expected, but radar trends
will continue to be monitored through the morning.
