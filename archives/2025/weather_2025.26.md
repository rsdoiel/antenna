Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0747 AM CDT Tue Jul 01 2025

Valid 011300Z - 021200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PARTS OF THE
MID-ATLANTIC REGION AND ACROSS WESTERN PORTIONS OF NEBRASKA AND
SOUTH DAKOTA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe storms are possible across parts of the
Mid-Atlantic into the Northeast this afternoon/evening.  A few
severe thunderstorms are possible over western parts of Nebraska and
South Dakota.

...Mid-Atlantic states into the Northeast and Southeast...
Water-vapor imagery this morning indicates an upper trough is moving
east across the Great Lakes/lower OH Valley and other minor
perturbations are located over the Mid South.  The primary
disturbance will overspread the Appalachians by mid-late evening. 
In the low levels, a cold front analyzed over the southern Great
Lakes into the lower OH Valley/Mid South will gradually progress
east/southeast during the period.

12 UTC raob data from the OH Valley and Mid South eastward to the
Mid-Atlantic region shows a very moist troposphere with limited
700-500 mb lapse rates (less than 5.5 deg C/km).  Nonetheless,
diurnal heating of the moist boundary layer will result in moderate
buoyancy from portions of the Northeast southwestward through the
Mid-Atlantic states and into the Southeast.  Models continue to
indicate modest southwesterly mid-level flow across the Mid-Atlantic
states will contribute to adequate shear, supporting some
organization of storms into line segments/clusters.  Scattered
thunderstorms will increase in coverage with time and numerous
thunderstorms are expected by mid-late afternoon while moving east
across PA/WV/VA/MD.  Strong to severe gusts (50-65 mph) are possible
with the stronger downdrafts.  Less organized but scattered to
numerous storms are forecast farther southwest into portions of the
southern Appalachians with a risk for damaging gusts with the
stronger storms.  Strong-severe convection should spread off the
Middle Atlantic Coast during the evening.

...Black Hills into the central High Plains...
A weak mid-level disturbance is moving east across northern
WY/southern MT towards the SD/NE vicinity later today.  A weak lee
trough will likely serve as a focus for thunderstorm development
this afternoon from near the Black Hills southward into northeast
CO.  Forecast soundings show around 30-kt effective shear in the
presence of steep lapse rates and moderate MLCAPE (1000-2500 J/kg). 
Some of the recent MPAS guidance indicates a few stronger
thunderstorms will develop across western NE and perhaps into
western SD.  A couple of supercells with an attendant large-hail
risk are possible, thereby prompting an increase in hail
probabilities this outlook update.  Some severe risk may linger into
the mid-late evening coincident with a strengthening of a southerly
LLJ centered over west-central NE before this activity dissipates.

## SPC Jul 1, 2025 Day 4-8 Severe Weather Outlook

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0400 AM CDT Tue Jul 01 2025

Valid 041200Z - 091200Z

...DISCUSSION...
A mid-level trough will traverse the Northern Plains and Upper
Midwest on Friday. This will likely be the most substantial severe
weather threat during the extended period before broad, strong
ridging builds across much of the eastern/central CONUS. 

...Day 4/Friday...
As a positively tilted mid-level trough traverses the northern
Plains on Friday, strong southerly flow will advect moisture
northward across a broad warm sector near the Upper Midwest. This
will result in moderate to strong instability as temperatures warm
well into the 80s. Widespread thunderstorms are likely along the
frontal zone during the afternoon/evening. 35 to 40 knots of
mid-level flow will overspread the warm sector which will provide
some shear for storm organization. However, southwesterly surface
winds will also increase during the afternoon within the warm front
and therefore, the net shear may remain somewhat minimal. Some
organized storms with a threat for large hail and severe wind gusts
are possible, but the aforementioned concerns about deep-layer shear
preclude the confidence needed for 15% severe weather probabilities
at this time.

Beyond Day 4, moderate to strong instability is forecast across much
of the central and eastern CONUS with widespread thunderstorm
activity likely. However, shear will remain mostly nebulous with the
stronger mid-level flow confined to areas north of the better
instability. Therefore, some marginal regional severe weather threat
will be likely most days, but a more organized severe weather risk
appears unlikely at this time.

## Hurricane Flossie Forecast Discussion Number 9

date: 2025-07-01, from: Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>000
WTPZ41 KNHC 010847
TCDEP1
 
Hurricane Flossie Discussion Number   9
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062025
300 AM CST Tue Jul 01 2025

Flossie continues to strengthen early this morning, evident by an 
expanding central dense overcast (CDO) over the low-level center of 
the cyclone.  A couple recent scatterometer passes at 0337z and 
0428z helped in locating the center underneath the CDO, and assisted 
with the refinement of the 34 and 50 knot wind radii.  The latest 
subjective Dvorak intensity estimates came in at T4.0/65 knots from 
both SAB and TAFB. The objective intensity estimates ranged from 69 
to 79 knots at 06z.  Based on a blend of these estimates, and taking 
into account the improved satellite presentation during the past few 
hours, the initial intensity has been raised to 75 knots for this 
advisory.  

Flossie is heading toward the west-northwest or 300/09 knots. This 
motion is expected to continue during the next several days with a 
slight decrease in forward speed, as the cyclone is steered into a 
weakness in the mid-level ridge to the northwest of the system. The 
track forecast is very close to the previous advisory and is closely 
aligned with a blend of the latest HCCA, TVCE, and FSSE consensus 
aids as well as the latest EC-AIFS run.

The environment will remain very conducive for strengthening during 
the next 24 to 36 hours, with warm sea surface temperatures of 
28/29C, abundant mid-level moisture, and light vertical wind shear. 
The latest SHIPS RI probabilities show a greater than 40 percent 
chance of a 25-knot increase in 24 hours, and the official forecast 
reflects this. Rapid weakening will then begin by 48 hours as 
Flossie moves over progressively cooler water and begins to entrain 
dry mid-level air.  The system is forecast to become a post-tropical 
low by 72 hours and a remnant low at 96 hours. The intensity 
forecast is on the high end of the intensity aids, closest to SHIPS 
and NNIC.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The outer bands of Hurricane Flossie should bring locally heavy 
rainfall to coastal portions of the Mexican states of Guerrero,  
Michoacán, Colima, and Jalisco through Wednesday. Life-threatening 
flooding and mudslides are possible, particularly in steep terrain.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the
tropical storm warning area in southwestern Mexico, through today.

Mesoscale Discussion 1526
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0303 PM CDT Mon Jun 30 2025

Areas affected...portions of central/southern New Mexico

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 302003Z - 302200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated severe wind gusts possible this
afternoon/evening.

DISCUSSION...Regional satellite/radar shows a few areas of robust,
terrain-driven convection, mainly across central/northern portions
of New Mexico with some merging of convection beginning to occur.
These storms initiated amid strong morning insolation and sufficient
boundary layer moisture for destabilization, characterized by dew
point temperatures in the upper 40s and lower 50s F. These
conditions have led to MLCAPE values near 1000 J/kg and strong
low-level lapse rates, exceeding 8-9 C in most areas. Storms are
expected to continue merging and gradually move off the high terrain
and drift south with time. Isolated severe wind gusts will be
possible with this activity through the remainder of the afternoon
into the early evening.

## Tropical Storm Flossie Forecast Discussion Number 7

date: 2025-06-30, from: Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>473 
WTPZ41 KNHC 302041
TCDEP1
 
Tropical Storm Flossie Discussion Number   7
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062025
300 PM CST Mon Jun 30 2025
 
Flossie's satellite presentation has continued to improve throughout 
the day, with convective cold cloud tops near -80C over the 
low-level center, and well-defined curve banding features. An 
earlier scatterometer pass around 1629 UTC showed a peak wind of 47 
kt, and helped to refine the current tropical-storm-force wind 
radii. Latest objective and subjective satellite intensity estimates 
range from 45 to 55 kt, including a T/3.5 from TAFB. Given the 
satellite trends, the intensity is set to 55 kt closes to UW-CIMSS 
ADT and the TAFB Dvorak estimates.

The storm is within a favorable environment to continue 
strengthening, current SSTs are around 29-30C, with low vertical 
wind shear. The NHC intensity forecast remains on the higher end of 
the guidance envelope and now has a peak intensity of 90 kt, closest 
to the regional hurricane HAFS models. In about 48 h, environmental 
conditions become increasingly more hostile, with drier air and 
cooler sea surface temperatures, which should induce a steady 
weakening trend. By day 4, Flossie is forecast to become a 
post-tropical cyclone as the system will struggle to produce 
convection within the harsh environment.
 
The initial estimated motion is toward the northwest, or 305/10 kt. 
A northwest to west-northwest motion is expected throughout the 
forecast period steered by a mid-level ridge. The NHC track forecast 
was nudged slightly to the left and lies closest to the HCCA 
corrected consensus aids.
 
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The outer bands of Tropical Storm Flossie should bring locally 
heavy rainfall to coastal portions of the Mexican states of 
Guerrero, Michoacán, Colima, and Jalisco through Wednesday. 
Life-threatening flooding and mudslides are possible, particularly 
in steep terrain.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are expected in portions of the 
tropical storm warning area in southwestern Mexico, later today 
through Tuesday.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0302 PM CDT Mon Jun 30 2025

Valid 302000Z - 011200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN PLAINS INTO THE MIDWEST AND MID ATLANTIC STATES...AND PARTS
OF THE DESERT SOUTHWEST AND WEST COAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible across portions of the
southern Plains into the Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic, and in parts
of the Desert Southwest, and also in adjacent parts of southern
Oregon and northern California today.

...20Z Update...
Forecast scenario remains unchanged. See active Mesoscale
Discussions and the prior Outlook discussion below.

..Guyer.. 06/30/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1128 AM CDT Mon Jun 30 2025/

...Southern OK/Northwest TX...
Morning visible satellite imagery confirms an outflow boundary
extending across central OK.  Strong heating to the south of the
boundary will lead to a very unstable air mass with dewpoints in the
mid 70s and MLCAPE values over 3000 J/kg.  Scattered thunderstorms
are expected to develop along the boundary by mid-afternoon,
propagating southward into north TX during the evening.  Winds aloft
are rather weak in this area, suggesting limited storm organization.
 However, the degree of instability and steep low-level lapse rates
will promote a risk of damaging wind in the stronger cells.  Hail
will also be possible in the strongest updrafts.

...PA/NY...
A warm and humid air mass is present once again across parts of
NY/PA, where daytime heating will lead to MLCAPE values of 1500-2000
J/kg.  Forecast soundings suggest ample mid-level moisture which
will be favorable for considerable coverage of storms, but may limit
the overall severe downdraft potential.  Nevertheless, a few strong
to severe cells capable of locally damaging wind gusts are possible.
 Refer to MCD #1522 for further details.

...NM/Southeast AZ...
Upper 40s and 50s dewpoints have become established across the
mountains of southern NM into southeast AZ.  Full heating will lead
to deep mixing and inverted-v profiles over the region.  Scattered
afternoon thunderstorms will likely result in gusty/damaging wind
gusts in some of this activity.

...Upper MI/WI...
A progressive shortwave trough over northern MN will track into the
Great Lakes region today, with cooling mid-level temperatures and
increasing large scale forcing.  This will lead to scattered
late-afternoon thunderstorms over parts of WI and the Upper MI. 
Locally gusty winds and hail are possible in these storms.

...Northern CA/Southern OR...
Ahead of the weak upper trough immediately west of the CA coast,
southerly flow will aid in increasing mid-level moisture across
parts of northern CA and southern OR.  Ample heating coupled with
weak large-scale and orographic ascent will aid in isolated to
scattered high-based thunderstorm development.  Very steep lapse
rates will pose a risk of gusty/damaging winds.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0257 PM CDT Mon Jun 30 2025

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...Northern California into Oregon...
Upper-level low and favorable convective environment will support a
mix of dry/wet thunderstorms mainly across the higher terrain of
northern California into much of southern and central Oregon.
Isolated dry thunderstorm highlights were adjusted slightly
southward along the California Coastal Range and northern Sierra
Nevada.

...Great Basin...
The mid-level trough and associated elevated mid-level flow will
promote elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions across
much of central and eastern Nevada. South winds of 15-20 mph
combined with relative humidity at or below 15 percent will support
higher wildfire spread potential within dry fuels.

...Central Utah into Northwestern Arizona...
Isolated dry thunderstorm threat was expanded into northwestern
Arizona for Tuesday. Deeper monsoon moisture will remain south of
the Mogollon Rim Tuesday with a mix of wet and dry thunderstorms
expected in the afternoon. Fuels remain dry with potential dry
lightning ignitions away from heavier precipitation cores.

..Williams.. 06/30/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0221 AM CDT Mon Jun 30 2025/

...Synopsis...
Mid-level flow across the CONUS should continue to amplify as the
sub-tropical ridge over the West gradually shifts eastward. The
upper low across the West Coast will intensify, spreading enhanced
flow aloft and monsoon moisture over much of the West. The increased
moisture will support dry thunderstorms over the Northwest and UT,
while warm and breezy conditions will favor elevated fire-weather
conditions over the Great Basin.

...Central Great Basin...
As the upper low over the West intensifies, enhanced mid-level flow
will overspread parts of the Great Basin and Southwest. On the
periphery of the building upper ridge, very warm and dry conditions
are likely. The stronger southerly mid-level flow over top the
dry/well-mixed boundary layer will support gusty southerly winds
across central/southern NV Tuesday. Widespread gusts of 15-25 mph
are expected, with RH values below 15%. As area fuels continuing to
dry, elevated to locally critical fire-weather conditions are
likely.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
A second day of thunderstorms is expected from northern CA into
southern OR and western ID Tuesday. Weak ascent from the upper low,
coupled with northward moving monsoon moisture will support
scattered storms through much of the day. Increased storm motions
and, steep low-level lapse rates will still favor relatively poor
precipitation efficiency. This suggests dry lighting is again
possible across the northern Coastal ranges of CA, east of the
Cascades to the OR/ID border.

Across parts of UT, the initial influx of deeper monsoon moisture
from the upper-level trough into the Intermountain West will support
isolated thunderstorms across the central mountains Tuesday. With
PWAT values of 0.7-0.8 inches and modest storm speeds, a mixed mode
of wet and dry storms is expected over the higher terrain. Very
receptive fuels (ERCs > 90th percentile), suggest dry lightning
ignitions are possible outside the heavier precip core.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0221 PM CDT Mon Jun 30 2025

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
THE NORTHERN ROCKIES...

...SUMMARY...
At least scattered storms are possible across a large portion of the
continental U.S. on Wednesday. A couple of severe gusts may
accompany the stronger storms over portions of the Northern Rockies.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will meander across the Northeast while upper
ridging persists over the central CONUS and a mid-level trough
advances over the Pacific Northwest on Wednesday. Seasonal moisture
and associated diurnal heating will encourage at least scattered
development across most of the CONUS during the afternoon and
evening hours. However, a couple of thunderstorms embedded in the
stronger mid-level flow over the Northern Rockies could become
strong. Given adequate shear and instability in this region, a few
of the stronger storms could become severe.

...Portions of the Northern Rockies...
The periphery of relatively greater mid-level moisture is poised to
traverse the western extent of the upper ridge on Wednesday.
Stronger west-southwesterly mid-level flow will graze the Northern
Rockies due to the approach of the upper trough to the west. Robust
boundary layer heating in this region will boost low-level lapse
rates to 9 C/km over several locales, as 8.5 C/km mid-level lapse
rates overspreads the well-mixed boundary layer. MLCAPE may exceed
1000 J/kg over many areas, and thunderstorms accessing this buoyancy
will be embedded in stronger mid-level flow and 30-40 kts of
effective bulk shear. As such, stronger multicells may produce a mix
of wet and dry downbursts, perhaps inducing a couple of severe
gusts.

Day 2 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1229 PM CDT Mon Jun 30 2025

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR PORTIONS OF
THE MID-ATLANTIC...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe storms are possible across parts of the
Mid-Atlantic into the Northeast on Tuesday afternoon/evening. An
isolated severe storm may also occur over parts of the central High
Plains.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will traverse the Northeast as an upper ridge
persists over the central U.S. and a mid-level low meanders over CA
tomorrow (Tuesday). The East Coast mid-level trough will encourage
the eastward advancement of a cold front, which will provide enough
lift for scattered to widespread thunderstorm development across the
Carolinas into the Northeast. Rich low-level moisture preceding the
front will encourage enough buoyancy, amid marginal but adequate
vertical wind shear, to support strong thunderstorms, some of which
could be severe. A couple of strong to severe storms are possible
along the periphery of the upper ridge over parts of the northern
Rockies into the central High Plains.

...Northeast into the Southeast...
As the surface cold front advances eastward across the eastern U.S.,
surface temperatures will warm into the 80s F to near 90 F, amid 70+
F dewpoints from the Southeast to the Mid-Atlantic, boosting SBCAPE
into the 2000-3500 J/kg range by afternoon peak heating. Relatively
poor mid-level lapse rates will limit CAPE to tall/thin profiles.
However, the magnitude of buoyancy, combined with widespread
thunderstorm coverage over a large area, will foster ample
opportunity for at least isolated damaging gusts with wet
downbursts, from the Southeast to New England. A more concentrated
area of damaging gust potential exists over parts of the
Mid_Atlantic, where a Category 2/Slight Risk remains in place. Here,
line segments are expected to organize amid a region of maximum
buoyancy and 30 kts of effective bulk shear, driven by stronger
west-southwesterly mid-level flow grazing the area.

...Portions of the Northern Rockies...
Mid-level monsoonal moisture is forecast to crest the upper ridge
amid modest 500 mb west-southwesterly flow over parts of the
Northern Rockies, where guidance consensus shows PWATs reaching 0.8
inches in spots. High-based thunderstorms will develop by afternoon
peak heating, atop a well-mixed boundary layer extending to 500 mb
via inverted-v thermodynamic profiles. The aforementioned mid-level
moisture, combined with steep tropospheric lapse rates, will support
over 500 J/kg MLCAPE. This buoyancy may support robust enough
updrafts and subsequent storm cores in an environment where ample
evaporative cooling may take place to support isolated severe gusts.

...Central High Plains...
Low-level upslope flow, along with strong diurnal heating, and the
passage of a small impulse embedded in the upper ridge, will all
serve as mechanisms for convective initiation tomorrow afternoon.
Though storms should be isolated, they will develop amid 8 C/km low
and mid-level lapse rates that will boost MLCAPE into the 1500-2500
J/kg range. Modest directional vertical wind shear will support
somewhat curved/elongated hodographs and around 35 kts of effective
bulk shear. As such, a few multicells/transient supercells may
develop and produce isolated severe wind/hail.

## SPC Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

date: 2025-06-30, from: NOAA tornado/severe thunderstorm watches, mesoscale discussions, convective outlooks, fire weather outlooks

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1155 AM CDT Mon Jun 30 2025

Valid 301700Z - 011200Z

...Northern California and Southwestern Oregon...
An approaching mid-level trough, steep low-level lapse rates and
increasing mid-level moisture and instability will aid a mix of
wet/dry thunderstorm development across the higher terrain of
northern California, with showers and thunderstorms propagating into
southern Oregon along and east of the Cascades through this evening.
Isolated dry thunderstorm highlights persist where new ignitions are
possible atop dry fuels.

...Great Basin...
The mid-level trough entering California and associated stronger
southerly mid-level flow will overspread the Great Basin today. A
deep, well-mixed boundary layer will facilitate gusty surface winds
from the south of up to 25 mph across central Nevada, with sustained
winds of around 15 mph. The enhanced winds along with low relative
humidity will promote an elevated fire weather threat amid receptive
fuels.

..Williams.. 06/30/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0215 AM CDT Mon Jun 30 2025/

...Synopsis...
Across the US, sub-tropical ridging will build over the Plains,
keeping stronger flow aloft displaced to the north while an upper
low will overspread portions of the West Coast. Ahead of the low,
breezy southerly winds will advect monsoon moisture northward into
parts of CA and OR. Dry thunderstorms and dry/breezy conditions
appear likely to support elevated fire-weather potential across the
Northwest and Great Basin today.

...Northwest...
Weak ascent from an approaching upper trough will allow for isolated
to widely scattered thunderstorms across northern CA and southern OR
through tonight. Strong heating and dry sub-cloud layers with steep
lapse rates below 500mb will support a mixed wet/dry thunderstorm
environment capable of occasional dry lightning strikes.
Additionally, erratic outflow winds are likely near storms. The
increased potential for dry lightning atop receptive fuels, warrants
continuation of IsodryT probabilities where fire starts are
possible.

...Great Basin...
Beneath the upper ridge, very hot surface temperatures are expected
over parts of NV and western UT. Southerly surface winds may gust to
15-20 mph through the afternoon, concurrent with widespread RH
values below 15%. The presence of breezy low-level winds and the
hot/dry conditions will overlap with a progressively drier and
receptive fuels across NV. This could support a few hours of
elevated fire-weather potential through this evening.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1128 AM CDT Mon Jun 30 2025

Valid 301630Z - 011200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN PLAINS INTO THE MIDWEST AND MID ATLANTIC STATES...AND PARTS
OF THE DESERT SOUTHWEST AND WEST COAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible across portions of the
southern Plains into the Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic, and in parts
of the Desert Southwest, and also in adjacent parts of southern
Oregon and northern California today.

...Southern OK/Northwest TX...
Morning visible satellite imagery confirms an outflow boundary
extending across central OK.  Strong heating to the south of the
boundary will lead to a very unstable air mass with dewpoints in the
mid 70s and MLCAPE values over 3000 J/kg.  Scattered thunderstorms
are expected to develop along the boundary by mid-afternoon,
propagating southward into north TX during the evening.  Winds aloft
are rather weak in this area, suggesting limited storm organization.
 However, the degree of instability and steep low-level lapse rates
will promote a risk of damaging wind in the stronger cells.  Hail
will also be possible in the strongest updrafts.

...PA/NY...
A warm and humid air mass is present once again across parts of
NY/PA, where daytime heating will lead to MLCAPE values of 1500-2000
J/kg.  Forecast soundings suggest ample mid-level moisture which
will be favorable for considerable coverage of storms, but may limit
the overall severe downdraft potential.  Nevertheless, a few strong
to severe cells capable of locally damaging wind gusts are possible.
 Refer to MCD #1522 for further details.

...NM/Southeast AZ...
Upper 40s and 50s dewpoints have become established across the
mountains of southern NM into southeast AZ.  Full heating will lead
to deep mixing and inverted-v profiles over the region.  Scattered
afternoon thunderstorms will likely result in gusty/damaging wind
gusts in some of this activity.

...Upper MI/WI...
A progressive shortwave trough over northern MN will track into the
Great Lakes region today, with cooling mid-level temperatures and
increasing large scale forcing.  This will lead to scattered
late-afternoon thunderstorms over parts of WI and the Upper MI. 
Locally gusty winds and hail are possible in these storms.

...Northern CA/Southern OR...
Ahead of the weak upper trough immediately west of the CA coast,
southerly flow will aid in increasing mid-level moisture across
parts of northern CA and southern OR.  Ample heating coupled with
weak large-scale and orographic ascent will aid in isolated to
scattered high-based thunderstorm development.  Very steep lapse
rates will pose a risk of gusty/damaging winds.

## Tropical Storm Flossie Forecast Discussion Number 5

date: 2025-06-30, from: Eastern Pacific Basin Tropical Cyclones

<pre>000
WTPZ41 KNHC 300837
TCDEP1
 
Tropical Storm Flossie Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062025
300 AM CST Mon Jun 30 2025
 
A 30/0357 UTC ASCAT-B pass over Flossie showed a sizable area of
30-35 kt winds in the NE quadrant, with 25-30 kt winds wrapping into
portions of the SE and NW quadrants.  The ASCAT data also indicates
that the RMW has contracted to about 40 n mi.  SSMIS and GMI
microwave passes between 00-03Z were also helpful in diagnosing the
position and structure of Flossie.  Since the time of the
above-mentioned microwave images, GOES satellite imagery indicates
that Flossie has started to become better organized, and it appears
that the low-level center is likely underneath the northern portion
of the central convective area, which has increased in size and
contains a large area of cloud tops colder than -80 degrees C. The
initial intensity is set to 40 kt due to the improved organization
since the time of the ASCAT pass.  This estimate is also in line
with the latest objective intensity estimates from the UW-CIMSS ADT,
AiDT and DPRINT, which are running in the 40-45 kt range.
 
Atmospheric and oceanic conditions are expected to remain favorable
for intensification for at least another 48 h as Flossie moves
through an environment of warm water, weak vertical wind shear, and
a moist mid-level troposphere.  Rapid intensification remains a
distinct possibility over the next day or two.  The NHC forecast
continues to show steady to rapid intensification.  The official
forecast is near the higher end of the intensity guidance envelope.
Beyond 48 h, Flossie should gradually encounter a dry and stable
airmass and cross over cooling waters which will lead to steady
weakening.
 
The initial motion estimate is toward the northwest, or 315/9 kt. A
motion between west-northwest and northwest should continue for the
next few days as Flossie moves through a break in the subtropical
ridge.  The NHC track forecast is mostly unchanged from the previous
official forecast, and lies in between the simple and corrected
consensus aids.
 
The latest NHC forecast has necessitated the issuance of a Tropical
Storm Warning for portions of the coast of Mexico, as
tropical-storm-force wind speed probabilities are in the 40 to 50
percent range for portions of the area.  Residents of Mexico should
stay updated on the latest forecast.  A shift in track to the right
of the official forecast could bring more significant impacts to the
coast of southwestern Mexico.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The outer bands of Tropical Storm Flossie may bring locally heavy
rainfall to the Mexican states of Oaxaca, Guerrero, Michoacán,
Colima, and Jalisco through mid-week. Life-threatening flooding and
mudslides are possible, particularly in areas of steep terrain.
 
2. A tropical storm warning has been issued for a portion of
southwestern Mexico, where tropical storm conditions are expected
late today through Tuesday.

Mesoscale Discussion 1513
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0337 PM CDT Sun Jun 29 2025

Areas affected...southeast Kansas...southwest Missouri...and far
northeast Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 478...

Valid 292037Z - 292200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 478
continues.

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will continue through the afternoon.
Isolated wind damage should be the primary threat.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms continue to develop/loosely organize
across southeast Kansas and southwest Missouri this afternoon along
the leading edge of an advancing cold pool from overnight
convection. The airmass along and ahead of these storms is strongly
to extremely unstable, with MUCAPE values in excess of 5000 J/kg
across northeast Oklahoma and northwest Arkansas, with very little
convective inhibition remaining. 

The degree of instability and loose organization should continue a
severe threat through the afternoon despite the presence of meager
deep-layer shear. The extreme instability, and precipitable water
values near 2 inches in the vicinity of these thunderstorms should
lead to continued water-loaded downdrafts and a reinforcement of the
cold pool, leading to continued thunderstorm development. An
isolated severe wind gust or wind damage will be possible this
afternoon, especially on or near area lakes where frictional effects
will be minimized.

Mesoscale Discussion 1512
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0322 PM CDT Sun Jun 29 2025

Areas affected...Portions of Wisconsin

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 477...

Valid 292022Z - 292145Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 477
continues.

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will continue this afternoon in a strongly
unstable airmass. Large hail and isolated wind damage are possible
with the strongest thunderstorms.

DISCUSSION...Thunderstorms continue along a diffuse frontal zone
across Wisconsin this afternoon in response to strong diurnal
heating and  minimal inhibition. Despite most-unstable CAPE values
in excess of 2000 J/kg, these thunderstorms have shown little
organization nor longevity -- likely owing to the weak deep-layer
shear. 

Given the degree of instability, freezing heights are sufficiently
low to support an isolated large hail threat through the afternoon,
especially with the strongest thunderstorm cores. Additionally, the
potential for isolated wind damage may occur with any strong
thunderstorm updraft collapse.

Mesoscale Discussion 1511
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0300 PM CDT Sun Jun 29 2025

Areas affected...southeast CO and northeast NM

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 292000Z - 292130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated severe gusts and small to marginally severe hail
will be possible through late afternoon across southeast Colorado
into northeast New Mexico. After coordination with WFO PUB, watch
issuance in the near-term is unlikely, but may increase later
towards the Kansas border.

DISCUSSION...Several cells have formed from the Pikes Peak region
southward along the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Much of this region
lies on the fringe of meager buoyancy with a deep, well-mixed
boundary layer across the adjacent High Plains. PUB VWP data sampled
slightly stronger low-level northeasterlies relative to mid-level
westerlies, indicative of the modest deep-layer flow and shear
environment. Nevertheless, the large surface temperature-dew point
spreads will be favorable for microbursts capable of strong to
severe gusts. Convection is expected to remain disorganized over the
next few hours. There is signal that some uptick may occur into
early evening as outflows impinge on increasingly greater buoyancy
towards the KS border.

Tropical Storm Flossie Discussion Number   3

Earlier SSMIS microwave data and satellite imagery depicted Flossie 
becoming better organized with curved banding features. However, 
recent imagery shows that banding has become a little more broken 
since the previous advisory, as Flossie is still trying to organize 
and consolidate. A 1600 UTC METOP-C scatterometer pass shows that 
the low-level center has become better defined, however was slightly 
south of the previously estimated position, and satellite-derived 
winds were around 31 kt. Using the scatterometer data and the latest 
subjective Dvorak intensity estimates T2.5, from both TAFB and SAB, 
the intensity is held at 35 kt for this advisory.
 
Flossie is located within a favorable environment for strengthening 
with warm sea surface temperatures, plentiful moisture and low to 
moderate wind shear. As the system becomes better organized, steady 
strengthening is forecast. Rapid intensification indices remain 
elevated in latest SHIPS guidance, however RI is not explicitly 
forecast at this time. The latest NHC intensity forecast is similar 
to the previous, closest to the hurricane regional aids, but lies 
slightly below the HCCA corrected consensus.
 
The current motion is estimated to be westward-northwestward around 
295/7 kt. The storm is forecast moving west-northwestward  with a 
turn towards the northwest anticipated tomorrow around the western 
periphery of a subtropical ridge. The latest track forecast is near 
the previous, and lies between the simple and HCCA corrected 
consensus aids.
 
Residents of Mexico should stay updated on the latest forecast.  A 
track even a little more to the right of the official forecast could 
bring more significant impacts to the coast of southwestern Mexico.
 
KEY MESSAGES:
 
1. The outer bands of Tropical Storm Flossie may bring locally heavy 
rainfall to the Mexican states of Oaxaca, Guerrero, Michoacán, 
Colima, and Jalisco through early this week. Life-threatening 
flooding and mudslides are possible, particularly in areas of steep 
terrain.
 
2. A tropical storm watch is in effect for southwestern Mexico, and 
tropical storm warnings could be required later tonight for a 
portion of the coast of southern Mexico.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 300 PM CST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Flossie was 
located near latitude 13.5 North, longitude 100.4 West. Flossie is 
moving toward the west-northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h). A 
west-northwest to northwestward motion should continue over the next 
few days.

Maximum sustained winds are near 40 mph (65 km/h) with higher gusts.
Steady strengthening is forecast during the next few days, and the
system is expected to become a hurricane late Monday or Tuesday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km)
from the center.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1005 mb (29.68 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Tropical Storm Flossie can be found in the Tropical
Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDEP1 and WMO header

RAINFALL: Tropical Storm Flossie is expected to produce rainfall 
totals of 3 to 6 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 10 inches, 
across portions of the Mexican states of Oaxaca, Guerrero, 
Michoacán, Colima, and Jalisco through early this week. This 
rainfall may lead to areas of life-threatening flooding and 
mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain. 

For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with 
Tropical Storm Flossie, please see the National Weather Service 
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic available at

At 600 AM CST (1200 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Six-E
was located near latitude 13.2 North, longitude 99.7 West. The
depression is moving toward the west near 12 mph (19 km/h). A
west-northwestward to northwestward motion should begin later today
and continue through the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 35 mph (55 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Gradual strengthening is forecast today, followed by 
steady to rapid strengthening thereafter, and the system is expected 
to become a hurricane on Tuesday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1006 mb (29.71 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
RAINFALL: Tropical Depression Six-E is expected to produce rainfall
totals of 3 to 6 inches, with isolated maximum totals of 10 inches,
across portions of the Mexican states of Oaxaca, Guerrero,
Michoacán, Colima, and Jalisco through early next week. This
rainfall may lead to areas of life-threatening flooding and
mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain.
 
For a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with
Tropical Depression Six-E, please see the National Weather Service
Storm Total Rainfall Graphic available at
hurricanes.gov/graphics_ep6.shtml?rainqpf
 
WIND: Tropical storm conditions are possible along the coast within
the watch area Monday and Tuesday.
 
SURF: Swells generated by Tropical Depression Six-E will begin
increasing along the coast of southwestern Mexico Monday and
continue into mid-week. These swells are likely to cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 900 AM CST.

## Tropical Depression Six-E Forecast Discussion Number 1

WTPZ41 KNHC 290834
TCDEP1
 
Tropical Depression Six-E Discussion Number   1
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       EP062025
300 AM CST Sun Jun 29 2025

The convection associated with the area of low pressure located 
south of southern Mexico has become much better organized over the 
past 12 hours.  Additionally, a 29/0328 UTC ASCAT-C pass showed a 
well-defined, closed low-level circulation with maximum winds around 
25 kt.  The latest subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates 
from TAFB and SAB are T-2.5 and T-2.0, respectively.  The 
disturbance is upgraded to a tropical depression based on the 
development of organized convection and a well-defined center. 

The aforementioned ASCAT pass shows that Tropical Depression Six-E 
has a large RMW.  However, the cyclone is located within a favorable 
environment with warm SSTs, a moist mid-level troposphere and low to 
moderate vertical wind shear.  The depression is forecast to remain 
in these favorable conditions for another 3 to 4 days as it 
parallels the coast of Mexico.  Due to the large RMW, only slow 
strengthening is forecast for the first 24 h.  The system is 
expected to strengthen more quickly once it establishes a stronger 
convective core, and rapid intensification appears likely to occur 
by Tuesday.  The NHC intensity forecast is at the high end of the 
intensity guidance, especially at 60-72 h, and calls for the 
system to become a significant hurricane.  By 96 h, the cyclone 
should reach cooler water, and rapid weakening is likely in 4 to 5 
days, with the system likely becoming a remnant low around day 5. 

The current motion of the depression is estimated to be westward, or 
270/10 kt.   The cyclone is forecast to generally move in a 
direction between west-northwest and northwest for the next few 
days, toward a weakness in the subtropical ridge, and the model 
guidance is in good agreement on this general scenario.  The NHC 
forecast is down the middle of the guidance envelope, close to the 
TVCE consensus.  

Residents of Mexico should stay updated on the latest forecast.  A 
track even a little to the right of the official forecast would 
bring more significant impacts to the coast of southwestern Mexico.
