Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0752 AM CDT Wed May 07 2025

Valid 071300Z - 081200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS...OZARKS...GULF COAST...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe storms may occur today across parts of the southern
Plains and Ozarks to the Gulf Coast.

...Coastal/south-central Texas to middle Gulf Coast...
A cluster of previously severe storms (overnight) across Deep South
Texas is now over the western Gulf, with substantial
effective-boundary-reinforcing elevated convection spanning the
upper Texas coast to coastal Louisiana and the Mobile Bay vicinity.
The more intense convection should focus offshore today, but areas
along the immediate coast, such as southern Louisiana, may have some
lingering severe risk pending the disposition of existing early day
outflow and convection, ahead of what will likely be an
upscale-growing MCS over the northwest to north-central Gulf.

Farther to the west, considerable uncertainty exists with later-day
deep convective potential across south-central/southeast Texas given
the impacts of the overnight storms, with ramifications on lapse
rates, source region moisture etc., even with a nearly full diurnal
cycle for potential air mass adjustments/recovery. These
thermodynamic trends are also in the context of weak height rises
and larger-scale subsidence regionally. While some severe storms
could develop later today into peak heating under a more optimistic
airmass-recovery scenario, any such severe potential would likely
remain isolated and marginal overall. 

...Southern Plains to Ozarks/Ark-La-Tex..
The mid/upper-level low will progress eastward from the
south-central Plains toward the Ozarks/Lower Missouri Valley by
tonight, accompanied by a 50+ kt belt of west-southwesterly
mid-level winds on its southern periphery. Only a subtle surface
low/features and weak convergence will exist, but weak inhibition is
expected by afternoon as cloud breaks occur under the mid-level cool
pocket (-13C to -18C at 500mb), with upwards of 500-800 J/kg MLCAPE
plausible. Some of the semi-lower-topped storms could be strong or
locally severe with hail and wind gusts possible from mid/late
afternoon into this evening, and funnel/brief tornado potential
might also diurnally exist given ambient vorticity/steep lapse rates
in proximity to the upper low.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0313 AM CDT Wed May 07 2025

Valid 101200Z - 151200Z

...DISCUSSION...
From this weekend through early next week, an upper-level low will
be situated in the lower Mississippi Valley into the northern Gulf.
This feature will drive repeated days of convection within parts of
the Southeast into the Florida Peninsula. Lower-end severe potential
may occur with this activity, but how organized/intense it will be
is not certain. The upper-level low will become more progressive and
lift northeastward by the middle of next week. Shortwave ridging
aloft will move through the Plains into the Southeast in advance of
a western trough. With the presence of the upper low over the Gulf
Coast region, there will be offshore flow in the western Gulf for a
few days before moisture returns northward again in response to the
mid-week trough.

The largest uncertainty with this system will be the moisture
quality. Secondly, models currently project the strongest forcing to
be within the central/northern Plains, farther away from the
moisture plume moving north. At least as currently forecast, strong
southwesterly/westerly winds aloft should overspread the
southern/central Plains by late next week. This particular trend in
guidance is recent and confidence is accordingly low, but model
trends will continue to be monitored in the coming days.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1238 AM CDT Wed May 07 2025

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...Synopsis...
Fire weather potential will generally be limited for much of the
country on Thursday, though regional concerns will likely emerge for
parts of western North Dakota during the afternoon hours. A cold
front associated with a clipper low migrating across the Canadian
Prairies is forecast to push across central and eastern MT during
the day. Pre-frontal southerly flow is forecast to increase to 15-20
mph across western ND by late afternoon. A combination of
temperatures warming into the low 80s with deep boundary-layer
mixing should yield RH values in the low to mid 20s. Much of western
ND has remained dry over the past few days, and residual dead
grasses have supported a couple of large fires over the past week.
While the fire weather threat is not expected to be particularly
widespread, the potential for elevated fire weather conditions over
a receptive fuel landscape warrants highlights.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1237 AM CDT Wed May 07 2025

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected to remain limited for today
across the country. An upper trough over the central/southern Plains
will slowly drift east through the day. A secondary shortwave trough
is noted in water-vapor imagery over the Southwest. Scattered
showers and thunderstorms ahead of both of these features will limit
fire concerns for much of the Southwest, Plains, and Southeast.
Although receptive fuels and dry conditions remain across parts of
West TX, gradient winds are forecast to remain relatively weak.
Localized fire weather conditions may emerge across parts of eastern
MT where southerly winds are forecast to increase to 15-20 mph by
late afternoon. However, relative humidity values should generally
remain above 30% for most areas.

Mesoscale Discussion 0723
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 PM CDT Tue May 06 2025

Areas affected...Southeast Texas to much of Louisiana.

Concerning...Tornado Watch 234...

Valid 062048Z - 062215Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 234 continues.

SUMMARY...Continued threat for severe wind gusts, tornadoes, and
isolated hail.

DISCUSSION...A well-developed line of storms extends from
east-central Texas to northwest Louisiana. Sporadic wind damage and
at least one tornado has been reported thus far within the line. A
more favorable orientation of the line has occurred across northeast
Texas/northwest Louisiana where a bowing segment is apparent. In
addition, a tornado with a TDS was recently observed southwest of
the SHV radar where a leading supercell interacted with this line.
Limited surface base instability amid mid 60s dewpoints and
preceding rainfall should keep the tornado threat somewhat limited,
but enough surface based or near surface based instability is
present for some tornado threat near the apex of this bow,
particularly where any cell interactions occur. Expect the greatest
severe wind threat near this bowing segment of the line across
northern Louisiana this afternoon and into the early evening.
Farther south, isolated large hail and severe wind gusts are
possible, particularly with any embedded supercells within the line.

A conditional greater tornado threat exists with any supercells
which can develop along/south of the warm front in Louisiana where
STP values are around 2 to 3. STP values may increase this evening
as low-level shear strengthens. Convection strengthening across
southeast Texas could be the beginning of this potential threat. If
any of these supercells can remain discrete with sufficient
longevity to mature, they will pose a strong tornado threat this
afternoon/evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 0722
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0337 PM CDT Tue May 06 2025

Areas affected...portions of eastern Pennsylvania into northwestern
New Jersey and southern New York

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 233...

Valid 062037Z - 062200Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 233
continues.

SUMMARY...Additional instances of damaging gusts and perhaps hail
remain possible with the stronger storms. A tornado may still occur
with storms ahead of a pre-frontal boundary.

DISCUSSION...A primary arching band of strong thunderstorms persists
ahead of a pseudo-dryline pre-frontal boundary across far eastern
PA, with temperatures rising into the upper 70s F amid 10 degree F
dewpoint decreases as the boundary passes. These pre-frontal storms
have been the most organized so far, with multiple instances of
low-level rotation detected and an apparent tornado reported in the
past hour. The best chance for an additional tornado remains with
these storms, along the PA/NJ/NY borders, before the ongoing storms
move into a more stable airmass. Otherwise, strong wind gusts and
perhaps hail may develop with the stronger storms to the west of the
pre-frontal boundary.

Mesoscale Discussion 0721
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0227 PM CDT Tue May 06 2025

Areas affected...much of the Florida Peninsula

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 061927Z - 062200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...A sparse severe threat could develop this afternoon across
the FL Peninsula, where a stray damaging gust or instance of hail
are possible. However, the severe threat should be isolated at best,
precluding a WW issuance.

DISCUSSION...Strong surface heating has aided in thunderstorm
initiation across the FL Peninsula as temperatures have climbed over
90 F. Given at least upper 60s F dewpoints steep low-level lapse
rates, 2000-3000 J/kg MLCAPE are in place south of a remnant frontal
boundary per 19Z mesoanalysis. Synoptic forcing is weak and vertical
wind shear is quite poor, casting doubt on any appreciable severe
threat. However, if a robust thunderstorm manages to develop and
persist, the strong buoyancy in place may support an instance of
hail or strong wind gusts, especially over southern parts of the
Florida Peninsula. Given the very isolated nature of the severe
threat, a WW issuance is not expected.

0300 PM CDT Tue May 06 2025

Valid 062000Z - 071200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
EAST/SOUTHEAST TEXAS INTO WESTERN LOUISIANA...

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHERN MID-ATLANTIC/NORTHEAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected today into this evening,
especially across parts of east/southeast Texas and Louisiana. Large
hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, potentially a few of which may
be strong, are expected. Severe thunderstorms are also expected this
afternoon across parts of the northern Mid-Atlantic/Northeast and
the Florida Peninsula.

...20Z Update...
The primary change with this update was trimming severe
probabilities behind a squall line tracking eastward across parts of
east/southeast Texas. A separate area of severe hail/wind
probabilities were maintained and expanded slightly over the
southern High Plains -- closer to the cold-core upper low. See MCD
#720 for details on the severe risk here. Farther south, guidance
continues to suggest an uptick in severe-thunderstorm potential
across south TX during the overnight hours. While steep lapse rates
atop rich boundary-layer moisture would conditionally support a
couple supercells capable of producing large hail and severe winds,
the overall threat appears too conditional for higher probabilities
at this time.

..Weinman.. 05/06/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1130 AM CDT Tue May 06 2025/

...Southern Plains into the Lower Mississippi Valley...
Multiple supercells are ongoing late this morning across central TX
along/near a surface warm front. As an upper trough/low continues to
eject eastward over the southern Plains today, a rather favorable
environment will be in place this afternoon and evening for intense
severe thunderstorms across central/east-central TX into LA. Even
with continued cloudiness across the warm sector, filtered daytime
heating and the presence of modestly steep mid-level lapse rates
will support moderate to locally strong instability given the
rich/moist low-level airmass present. Ample low-level and deep-layer
shear will foster continued updraft organization, including the
potential for several supercells. The greatest potential for
tornadoes, some of which could be strong, will likely remain focused
along/near the warm front, which will attempt to lift northward some
across east TX and LA through the afternoon and evening. Otherwise,
large hail will be possible north of the warm front with elevated
supercells. A severe/damaging wind threat will exist with any
clusters that can become established.

The tornado and damaging wind threat will probably continue through
the evening and perhaps overnight hours across parts of the lower MS
Valley, given sufficient instability and strong low-level shear
along/near the warm front. Have therefore adjusted the Slight Risk
eastward some across this region. Have also trimmed the Slight Risk
from the southern High Plains, as low-topped convection closer to
the cold-core upper low will probably only have access to weak
instability this afternoon/evening. Still, this activity may have an
isolated hail/wind threat, and the Marginal Risk has been maintained
across the southern High Plains for this potential.

...Northern Mid-Atlantic/Northeast...
Even in the presence of some cloud cover, thunderstorm development
and intensification will occur this afternoon across parts of the
northern Mid-Atlantic and vicinity in a modestly moist/unstable air
mass preceding an upper low over the upper OH Valley. Relatively
steep lapse rates aloft and moderate to strong deep-layer
south-southwesterly flow should support organized convection capable
of severe hail and damaging winds. The best severe threat should
remain focused across parts of eastern PA into NJ and southern NY,
where the Slight Risk has been maintained with only small
expansions.

...Florida...
Upper ridging should be more influential today over FL compared to
yesterday. Still, cool temperatures aloft and moderate instability
could support occasionally strong to severe thunderstorms capable of
producing isolated hail and/or damaging winds this afternoon across
parts of the FL Peninsula along/south of a remnant front.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0230 PM CDT Tue May 06 2025

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN A BROAD
PORTION OF THE SOUTHERN AND EASTERN CONUS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms with large hail and damaging winds are
possible, mainly Thursday afternoon and evening, from southern Texas
across the Southeast and into the Lower Mid-Atlantic States.

...Synopsis...
A trio of primary shortwave impulses will aid in placement of a
large-scale trough from QC to the Rio Grande on Thursday afternoon.
This will support a broad swath of 30-50 kt 500-mb southwesterlies
across much of the southern to eastern states. This will occur
beneath upper-level jetlets, centered on the Lower Mid-Atlantic
States to the central/southern Appalachians, and trailing into
central/east TX. Attendant surface reflection will be weak, with
minor lows in the Mid-South and VA. A surface ridge should nose down
the southern High Plains and across much of the Rio Grande.

...Rio Grande Valley...
The lower-amplitude impulse within the base of the broad trough may
dampen somewhat. But most guidance suggests sufficient large-scale
ascent will exist for thunderstorms from the Trans-Pecos
moving/developing southeastward along the Rio Grande Thursday
afternoon and evening. The aforementioned surface ridging will
temper buoyancy northwest of Deep South TX. But a sufficient combo
of CAPE/shear should exist for at least isolated large hail and
strong gusts.

...Mid/Deep South...
Convective signal is strongest near the Mid-South shortwave impulse
during peak heating and along the central Gulf Coast during the
morning. The impact of the early-day activity yields a more nebulous
evolution to strong/severe storms north and east of it across the
Deep South. Where more robust diurnal heating can occur, the
favorable deep-layer flow regime will offer a threat of both severe
hail and damaging wind.

...South Atlantic Coast...
A mix of isolated severe hail and damaging winds will be possible,
especially along the sea breeze. A moderate combination of mid-level
westerlies and MLCAPE should foster a few weakly rotating
cells/clusters Thursday afternoon.

...Lower Mid-Atlantic...
A well-mixed boundary layer seems plausible by Thursday afternoon
amid limited low-level moisture north of the Carolinas. Strong
mid/upper-level speed shear and weak mid-level height falls should
support small hail in at least isolated storms, along and east of
the Appalachians. This will likely enhance downburst potential and
isolated damaging winds should be the main hazard.

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN PARTS OF SOUTH
TX...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible across the southern Great
Plains to coastal Louisiana on Wednesday. Large hail should be the
main hazard, which appears most likely in parts of south Texas
during the late afternoon to early evening.

...Synopsis...
Primary mid/upper low near the KS/OK border will drift east and
gradually dampen through the period. A minor surface wave may
accompany this low with a dryline extending south into south-central
TX. A broad MCS on D1 should yield large-scale convective outflow
near the upper TX to LA coast at 12Z Wednesday.

...South TX to coastal LA...
An extensive swath of convection will likely be ongoing across
portions of the northwest to north-central Gulf Coast. Limited real
estate may exist for morning severe, but could possibly affect
coastal LA where a low-probability wind/tornado threat has been
added. Afternoon to early evening thunderstorm redevelopment along
and north of the large-scale outflow will be dependent on its
spatial placement, as large-scale ascent wanes amid neutral
mid-level height change. A few supercells seem most probable where
the boundary intersects with the south-central TX dryline. Ample
buoyancy to the south of the outflow, along with strong effective
shear north of it, should yield a corridor of large hail threat
initially. Mid/upper flow tending to orient along the boundary will
support some clustering into the evening. This should limit coverage
of very large hail potential, with a mixed isolated severe hail/wind
threat across the coastal plain.

...Central/eastern OK into north TX...
Despite a fairly weak surface reflection and attendant convergence,
12Z CAM guidance is consistent with scattered storms developing
southeast of the mid/upper low in OK, and isolated storms into north
TX along the dryline. Guidance more broadly varies with degree of
destabilization/residual boundary-layer moisture in the wake of
extensive convective overturning on D1. Still, with steep mid-level
lapse rates accompanying the low and greater boundary-layer heating
in its vicinity tomorrow compared to today, a threat for at least
isolated severe hail and localized strong gusts is apparent. For
now, have upgraded to a level 1/MRGL hail-driven risk.

Severe thunderstorms are expected today into this evening,
especially across parts of central into east/southeast Texas and

isolated hail/wind threat, and the Marginal Risk has been maintained
across the southern High Plains for this potential.

...Northern Mid-Atlantic/Northeast...
Even in the presence of some cloud cover, thunderstorm development
and intensification will occur this afternoon across parts of the
northern Mid-Atlantic and vicinity in a modestly moist/unstable air
mass preceding an upper low over the upper OH Valley. Relatively
steep lapse rates aloft and moderate to strong deep-layer
south-southwesterly flow should support organized convection capable
of severe hail and damaging winds. The best severe threat should
remain focused across parts of eastern PA into NJ and southern NY,
where the Slight Risk has been maintained with only small
expansions.

...Florida...
Upper ridging should be more influential today over FL compared to
yesterday. Still, cool temperatures aloft and moderate instability
could support occasionally strong to severe thunderstorms capable of
producing isolated hail and/or damaging winds this afternoon across
parts of the FL Peninsula along/south of a remnant front.

Mesoscale Discussion 0712
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0611 AM CDT Tue May 06 2025

Areas affected...South-central into east-central TX

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 230...

Valid 061111Z - 061415Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 230
continues.

SUMMARY...An increase in the tornado threat is expected with time
this morning. Tornado Watch issuance is likely later this morning,
though timing is uncertain.

DISCUSSION...Some increase in convection has recently been noted
across parts of the TX Hill Country, in close proximity to a surface
warm front that is expected to lift northward through the morning
across parts of south-central into east-central TX. Favorable
deep-layer shear and low-level SRH (as noted on the KEWX VWP) will
result in supercell potential through the morning, especially as the
warm front moves northward and rich low-level moisture continues to
support moderate to locally strong buoyancy. 

Timing of additional supercell development and maturation within the
warm-advection regime remains somewhat uncertain, as does the
potential influence of an ongoing eastward-moving storm cluster near
San Angelo. However, as the threat for surface-based supercells
increases, a corresponding increase in the tornado threat is
expected with time this morning, in addition to potential for large
hail and locally damaging winds. A Tornado Watch will likely be
needed later this morning, though timing is uncertain.

Mesoscale Discussion 0700
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0348 PM CDT Mon May 05 2025

Areas affected...portions of southeastern Texas

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 225...

Valid 052048Z - 052215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 225
continues.

SUMMARY...The severe threat continues across Severe Thunderstorm
Watch 225. Large hail remains the main concern, but a tornado could
still occur if a supercell can become surface based.

DISCUSSION...Multiple supercell structures have developed across
southeast Texas, and have been progressing eastward on the immediate
cool side of a baroclinic zone. These supercells are likely still
elevated, and given adequate buoyancy above 700 mb (per RAP forecast
soundings), severe hail could still occur given elongated mid to
upper-level hodographs and corresponding 50+ kts of effective bulk
shear. Closer to the Gulf Coast, multiple thunderstorms continue to
intensify within a WAA regime. These storms are associated with a
relatively more unstable, surface-based airmass. Regional VADs on
the warm side of the baroclinic boundary show low-level hodographs
with modest size and curvature, with around 300 m2/s2 SRH present
(per 19Z mesoanalysis). It is unclear if these storms can organize
and intensify into mature surface-based supercells before reaching
the cool side of the baroclinic boundary. If they do though, a
tornado remains possible.

Areas affected...east-central and southeast FL

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 224...

Valid 052011Z - 052215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 224
continues.

SUMMARY...Potential for isolated large hail and localized severe
gusts should persist through early to mid evening across southeast
and east-central Florida.

DISCUSSION...Several cells across southeast FL have somewhat
weakened after earlier producing large hail reported up to ping-pong
ball size. This activity may still produce marginal hail/wind as
storms oscillate in the near-term. Large-scale convective outflow
has surged south and west, potentially serving as a focus for storm
development in the interior peninsula into early evening. 

Farther north, the Melbourne VWP has consistently sampled around
40-45 kt 0-6 km shear. Although thunderstorm development has been
subdued to an extent, additional storms may yet form along the
Atlantic sea breeze to the quasi-stationary front. Ample buoyancy
will favor isolated large hail and localized severe gusts.

Areas affected...eastern NC and southeast VA

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 223...

Valid 051910Z - 052115Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 223
continues.

SUMMARY...A mixed severe hail/damaging wind threat should persist
across eastern North Carolina and advance/shift north-northeast
across southeast Virginia through early evening.

DISCUSSION...Numerous cells have been prevalent, especially across
central into eastern NC this afternoon. Here, a south-southwesterly
deep-layer wind profile, per area VWPs, along with transient
supercell structures has resulted in convection largely progressing
northeastward thus far. But activity should pivot to a greater
northerly component given the evolution of the upstream vort
max/attendant mid-level jetlet. Air mass appears to be modestly
unstable downstream across southeast VA with MLCAPE of 1000-1500
J/kg. This should help sustain a severe hail/damaging wind threat
through early evening. Despite numerous cells and hail reports, peak
severe magnitude has only reached 1 inch thus far.

Mesoscale Discussion 0684
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0338 PM CDT Sun May 04 2025

Areas affected...southeast NM and far west TX

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 222...

Valid 042038Z - 042215Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 222
continues.

SUMMARY...Supercells are expected to intensify across southeast New
Mexico into parts of far west Texas through early evening. Hail is
the primary hazard, likely reaching golf to tennis ball size.
Isolated severe gusts to 70 mph and a brief tornado are possible.

DISCUSSION...Overall forecast remains as advertised. Storm
intensification has been gradual, but largely focused near the
Sacramento Mountains in Otero and Lincoln counties, and separately
over Eddy and Chaves, spreading into Lea within NM. These cells and
others that should develop off the higher terrain of the northern
Trans-Pecos in TX will likely intensify during the next few hours. A
ribbon of surface dew points near 50 F have held along the Pecos
Valley, supporting a confined corridor of moderate buoyancy. With
onset of strengthening low-level flow around 22Z, supercell
coverage/intensity should peak into early evening. Thereafter, drier
low-level air over the TX South Plains and eastern Permian Basin
should result in increased ingest of MLCIN deeper into the evening.

Mesoscale Discussion 0677
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0547 AM CDT Sun May 04 2025

Areas affected...eastern North Carolina into far southeast Virginia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 041047Z - 041345Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...Isolated strong gusts, and perhaps a brief/weak tornado,
cannot be ruled out over eastern North Carolina and eventually into
far southeast Virginia.

DISCUSSION...A line of convection with wind shift continues to push
east, now completely out of SC and over eastern NC. Earlier, a 50 kt
gust was measured near North Myrtle Beach. 

In addition to the narrow north-south line of convection, other
storms have developed ahead of the line. These storms have shown
periodic weak mesocyclones. Other storms continue to show
near-severe inbound velocities mainly over the water, but this
activity may eventually move inland.

The air mass is marginally unstable, but sufficient for isolated
severe reports this morning. Low-level SRH with 0-1 km values of
100-150 m2/s2 will continue to favor rotation within the stronger
storms, though any tornado risk should remain low-end in nature.
