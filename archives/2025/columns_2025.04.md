## 15 Minutes

date: 2025-01-28, from: Dave Rupert blog

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sMZdQaKcqs4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>This might be my favorite song of all time. It’s by a slightly obscure Chicago punk band called The Broadways, made up of a couple members from the more well-known ska band Slapstick. It’s got everything you want in a punk song. Palm mutes, open meedly-meedly parts, yelling, speed, a half-time breakdown, and impeccable synchronicity. I listen to this song when I’m sad, when I’m frustrated, when I’m in traffic, and when I need to inject high octane fuel into my veins. The soaring octave chords will always pick me back up again.</p>
<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="markdown">All on the streets, the signs read
Cheaper and better technology
This capitalist vision is my nightmare

Put up a sign in my face
What the fuck happened to this place?
I think we made a wrong turn
Look at the lovely concrete

I drove to my stupid job today
Got stopped at an intersection
Fifteen minutes of my life just rolled away

Looked at the guy next to me
He didn't look too happy
No one's happy, but everyone's too busy to see

Let's go shopping today
Drive our fancy cars to the fancy malls
And for lunch we'll have Big Macs

I wish I could turn the clock back
Back to when I was ten
When I wasn't scared of everything
And everything wasn't so fucking crowded

And I wonder if my kid will ever see the horizon
Untouched by billboards and shopping malls
And I wonder if this crazy world
Thinks I'm the one that's crazy

What if I'm the one who's crazy?
What if I'm the one who's crazy?
What if I'm the one who's crazy?
What if I'm the one who's crazy?
I'm not crazy, just frustrated
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>WIthout a doubt, this song from my teenage years subliminally shaped a lot of my views on what’s wrong with the world. Capitalist intrusions. Eyeball monetization. The always upgrade tech cycle. Why I hate crowds. And traffic. Life evaporating at a stop light seems like a criminal waste of humanity to me. This may subconsciously be part of why I work from home.</p>
<p>I’ll never live up to my punk rock ideals or my teenage self, but this song takes me back to them. Not to “when I was ten”, but to “when I was seventeen” for sure. Driving through big city Houston at night. Going to Food Not Bombs near the abandoned hospital. All it takes is the first verse and BOOM! I’m transported through time and I can see the world through my old anarcho-tinted glasses. It makes you want to smash systems and break concrete.</p>

## Is Bluesky billionaire-proof?

date: 2025-01-28, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Could what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk">happened</a> to Twitter, happen there?</p>
<p>To determine, ask yourself if you could continue to use it if it was acquired by a billionaire for their own personal political use?</p>
<p>What would you switch to?</p>
<p>Would you have to give up your history and followers?</p>
<p>And developers, what would you do if the billionaire acquirer dropped support for the api? How expensive and time consuming would it be to convert to a different protocol? Would you even bother?</p>
<p>We’ve learned a lot from the billionaire acquisition of twitter. The answer to these questions made a lot of us think we’d never want to do this again. But despite all the misleading hype, we very much are repeating the mistakes.</p>
<p>The current owners of Bluesky would be crazy if they closed off the opportunity to get rich. But they shouldn’t be misleading users and developers into believing that it’s safe to trust this as an open platform that couldn’t be acquired and have its utility consumed the way twitter's was.</p>
<p>This started as a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3lgsgmmhyf22q">thread</a> on Bluesky of course. :-)</p>
<p>PS: Spoiler -- Bluesky is, as it is currently configured, not billionaire-proof. It's going to get acquired, it probably already has, based on what they're doing. Remember, pay attention to what they do, not what they say. It's just as true in tech as it is in politics, and these days, what's the difference anyway? </p>
<p>PPS: If you're thinking ahh but there's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol">AT Protocol</a>, our ace in the hole. Please. Twitter had an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter#Technology">API</a> too. It didn't make a difference. And AT Proto won't either unless there are proven systems that people are actually using that peer with Bluesky's servers, so those users can't be sold to the billionaire. We're nowhere near that. No one can say with any certainty that it's even possible. At this point the continued support of the API is entirely up to the owners of Bluesky. They could change it, break developers or completely drop it and the users and developers would have no recourse. </p>

## CISA Under Trump

date: 2025-01-28, updated: 2025-01-28, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Jen Easterly is out as the Director of CISA. Read her final <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/big-interview-jen-easterly-cisa-cybersecurity/">interview</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s a lot of unfinished business. We have made an impact through our ransomware vulnerability warning pilot and our pre-ransomware notification initiative, and I&#8217;m really proud of that, because we work on preventing somebody from having their worst day. But ransomware is still a problem. We have been laser-focused on PRC cyber actors. That will continue to be a huge problem. I&#8217;m really proud of where we are, but there&#8217;s much, much more work to be done. There are things that I think we can continue driving, that the next administration, I hope, will look at, because, frankly, cybersecurity is a national security issue...</p></blockquote>

## 2025-01-27 Using rsync with Sqlite databases

date: 2025-01-27, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-01-27-using-rsync-with-sqlite-databases">2025-01-27 Using rsync with Sqlite databases</h1>

<p>I use Debian stable so my copy of Sqlite is not the latest and greatest.
At the same time, I don&rsquo;t use Borg Backup for my server. I use rsync.</p>

<p>I copy the content of the important server files to my local laptop
and then I make a backup of my laptop to external disks using Borg Backup.</p>

<p>When making copies using rsync, the database must not be in use.
Otherwise, a busy database is probably going to be corrupt when restoring
it from backup.</p>

<p>The key is to stop the program using the database before beginning the
backup and starting it after the backup. It&rsquo;s also important to stop
the program using the monitoring software. I use Monit to monitor the
server. If I don&rsquo;t stop GoToSocial using Monit, Monit will discover
that GoToSocial isn&rsquo;t running and start it while rsync is still copying
the database file. The database file is 10G so copying it takes a long
time. Long enough for Monit to discover that GoToSocial isn&rsquo;t running.</p>

<p>I should stop and start other programs, too: The Lounge, Norn, etc.</p>

<p>This is my script:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

# sibirocobombus.root is defined in ~/.ssh/config

# Using sudo rsync --archive to preserve ownership.
# Using --fake-super to avoid changes to groups and owners

## Rivers on Bluesky

date: 2025-01-27, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>This is a post for longtime Scripting News readers. As you know, I've been doing feed readers for a long time. They've been mostly organized around the <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22river%20of%20news%22">river of news</a> concept, which also happens to be the way twitter-like systems work. My rivers are built around <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> and formats that interop with RSS. </p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/19/basketball.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Then I got one of the ideas out of the blue that at first didn't make sense, but then the more I thought about the better the idea seemed. It came from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mcuban.bsky.social">Mark Cuban</a>, who liked one of my posts on Bluesky, it was about some FeedLand rivers I had produced, and then I did what I often do -- I offered to do something like that for him. For obvious reasons I don't need to go into here, you all are smart or you wouldn't be reading this. :-)</p>
<p>Anyway -- he said "I'd use that if it were on Bluesky." </p>
<p>My first thought, ridiculous -- can't be done. They have all these limits that aren't present in HTML. I don't have any idea how I could make this work. Here's a <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/01/27/riverInFeedlandScreenshot.png">screen shot</a> of what a river looks like in FeedLand. </p>
<p>But then after a few hours or days, the idea developed, as often happens, and I decided it might work and was worth a try. </p>
<p>So I wrote a piece of software that hooked into FeedLand's outbound news flow, and picked out stories from the right feeds, and shot them over to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/feediverse.bsky.social">an account on Bluesky</a>. Thanks to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mcuban.bsky.social">Cuban</a>, who linked to it from his million+ follower account, it has 7.6K followers. It uses the list of feeds in my <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=blogroll">blogroll</a> on Scripting News to feed the river. I think it's a really good pioneering effort, with quite a few followers who are active. And it's going to stay running for the indefinite future. That was in December. </p>
<p>Now I've gone a step further, and generalized the code so I can have N of these rivers instead of just one. And to prove it works, I now have two new rivers on Bluesky. </p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dave.feediverse.org">dave.feediverse.org</a> -- the <a href="https://news.scripting.com/?tab=dave">Dave tab</a> on my news site. It subscribes to all the RSS feeds I generate. My linkblog, Scripting News, even my YouTube channel which has an RSS feed. Chuck Shotton requested this. It was a good idea so it was the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dave.feediverse.org">first new river</a> I did on Bluesky. Went on the air just yesterday and now has 10 followers. </li>
<li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nba.feediverse.org">nba.feediverse.org</a> -- then my project for this morning is to do the same thing for the NBA. I'm a huge Knicks fan, and basically love all of the NBA. People say the Knicks must win a championship, but I say who cares. If they keep playing at this level, with new castmembers all the time, with the track record of current management, I'm a totally happy campter. If we won a championship all the more exciting, but after all those years in the wilderness, it's so nice to finally after all this time to have a great NBA team in NY (and sorry the Nets don't count). Anyway, there's nothing more really to say. If you like basketball, and use Bluesky -- <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nba.feediverse.org">here's</a> what you follow. </li>
</ol>
<p>One more thing -- no federation here folks. It's very simple. No new formats or protocols, built entirely on the tried-and-true RSS and OPML formats for feeds and subscription lists. (And of course support for Atom and RDF too.)</p>
<p>I'm glad Mark Cuban asked me to try this path, it provides something I hadn't thought of. Not just inbound feeds for Bluesky, inbound rivers. All we need now is Markdown support, and then a <a href="https://textcasting.org/">few more things</a>, and we'll be back to where we were in 1997. :-)</p>

## What is a sanctuary city?

date: 2025-01-27, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I wonder if people understand what a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary_city">sanctuary city</a> is. </p>
<ul>
<li>In a sanctuary city the local government accepts the fact that there are people living in the city who are not there legally. </li>
<li>They want these people to be able to call the police without fear of being turned into the feds. Otherwise crime would go unreported and that would create much larger problems. </li>
<li>They want the children of these people, who are often American citizens, to be able to go to school, again without having the parents reported to the feds. If they didn't guarantee that, the kids wouldn't be in school, and we all lose by having uneducated adults. It's a core principle of this country that educated citizens are a good thing.</li>
<li>They want them to be able to get health care, to go to a hospital when someone is seriously ill or injured. This is partly for pragmatic reasons, to slow disease spreading, and also because we are a rich country and keeping people healthy is a good thing, just like education. What other purpose could a government have? (A fair question for Republicans, one they probably wouldn't want to answer truthfully.) </li>
</ul>
<p>The Republican talking points make it sound like local governments that declare as sanctuary cities are weak or immoral or anti-American, but that is not what's going on. You couldn't run a city with huge crimes commited against illegals because they would be so vulnerable, and kids need education, and everyone needs health care. Yet I hear the word used all the time in public discourse, and am concerned that most people don't know what it means. </p>

## New VPN Backdoor

date: 2025-01-27, updated: 2025-01-25, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>A newly discovered <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/backdoor-infecting-vpns-used-magic-packets-for-stealth-and-security/">VPN backdoor</a> uses some interesting tactics to avoid detection:</p>
<blockquote><p>When threat actors use backdoor malware to gain access to a network, they want to make sure all their hard work can&#8217;t be leveraged by competing groups or detected by defenders. One countermeasure is to equip the backdoor with a passive agent that remains dormant until it receives what&#8217;s known in the business as a &#8220;magic packet.&#8221; On Thursday, researchers revealed that a never-before-seen backdoor that quietly took hold of dozens of enterprise VPNs running Juniper Network&#8217;s Junos OS has been doing just that...</p></blockquote>

## A story about pans

date: 2025-01-26, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>The other day I sent my wife a link to <a href="https://madeincookware.com/products/ceramic-frying-pan/set">a new set of ceramic pans</a> and asked, “What do you think?” assuming she’d be as impressed as I was of the picture of eggs sliding off the pan. Her response: a grimace. Using my sixteen years of husbandly intuition, I surmised that we were not on the same page about kitchenware.</p>
<p>For context, my wife has had the same stainless steel pans that her parents bought her since we met. They’ve outlasted the fancier non-stick pans we’ve auditioned. Her opinion of the pans is that they’re high-quality because they’ve lasted so long and still work. And from that perspective she’s right, they technically still work… but not without some downsides.</p>
<p>When you use stainless steel pans instead of non-stick pans, you’re committing to stickiness and having a harder time cleaning your pans. I can accept that as an incurred cost. I think my bigger issue is that ALL our pans do this. Even our cast irons which we’ve made thousands of batches of bacon with but still aren’t seasoned. If you make scrambled eggs, about two eggs worth of material forms a brown sheet of crust on the bottom of the pan that I must scrape off but NOT using soap per the laws of properly seasoning a cast iron pan.</p>
<p>Anyways, my wife and I aren’t seeing eye-to-eye on the pans and I’m kind of struggling to see why. I think there’s some frugalness afoot and possibly some sentimental attachment to items that were gifts. And then she –with her Deanna Troi, betazoid-levels of empathy– said “You probably think we need new ones because you do the dishes” and that was our ah-ha moment!</p>
<p>In our house I’m the self-appointed dish-master because I can hyperfocus on them while listening to an audiobook, pairing something I don’t like with something I do like. My perspective on the pans is that they’re a lot of work to clean up every night. Scraping and scrubbing the charred chunky bits off so we can ruin them the next day. Essentially, I operate at a different end of the “stack” of dishes than she does so we see the situation differently. I have bigger feelings about the stickiness of the pans because that’s the part that I interface with the most. I would like to apply non-stick technology to improve the dish-washing process. Where she sees something that works okay and we’ve had for a long time, while I see a maintenance burden.</p>
<p>Now we have an end-to-end/cross-team perspective of our pans and that is valuable. We understand each other’s needs on a micro-level (the pans are too sticky) and the macro-level (one side of the stack inherits more burden with our pan choice) and that’s helpful for framing future conversations about pans. That said, I don’t think we’re getting new pans any time soon. Such is life. Not all decisions are technical ones.</p>
