## On government efficiency

date: 2025-02-02, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p><tt>It’s a secret to everyone! This post is for RSS subscribers only.
<a href="https://daverupert.com/rss-club/">Read more about RSS Club</a>.
</tt></p>
<p>I used to believe that the goal of the government should be efficiency. If the government was more efficient (waves hands broadly in the air), you could get rid of waste (again, waiving hands) and you’d need less taxes, and that would trickle down as more money for people, and you’d need less welfare (more hands), less red tape, and less bureaucracy.</p>
<p>I’ve changed my thinking on the subject. I now think the goal of the government should be to absorb inefficiencies.</p>
<p>As efficient as the fabled invisible hand of the market might be at lowering the costs of goods and services <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> and creating jobs<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> … there are often non-economic inefficiencies that come from rapidly scaling to produce cheaper goods in the infinite money machine. Rather than ignore those inefficiencies, I think the government should understand the ways the system breaks and invest in longer term ideas than making the stock market go up during the next quarter.</p>
<p>Here’s a short list of market inefficiencies where I think a government helps:</p>
<p><strong>Social Security and Medicare.</strong> Unpopular opinion, but I sort of do see social security as a Ponzi scheme; younger people at the bottom fund older people at the top who “got in first”. But you know what’s a bigger problem? Elderly adults retiring with no retirement plan. In our “Buy the latest iPhone” society, <a href="https://usafacts.org/data-projects/retirement-savings">people are statistically bad at planning for their own future</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Environment.</strong> The free hand of the market doesn’t nudge companies towards making responsible environmental decisions. Even though electrification is more efficient than carbon, the invisible hand is taking its sweet time moving over to it. Probably because the invisible hand gave too much money to the oil companies. We spend billions in aid for “once in a lifetime” acts of God that happen every year now. The “more efficient” act would be to kill carbon. We need a government to protect the non-monetizable resources that give us life like oceans, lakes, rivers, underground reservoirs, the air we breathe, and our forests.</p>
<p><strong>Healthcare.</strong> I hate the American healthcare system. We pay too much for too little. We don’t pay for healthcare, we pay for insurance company lawyers to haggle about medical codes. Doctors hate it. Patients hate it. Insurance companies reek of greed and corruption. And each of us “doing our own research” isn’t a great because you end up with people turning themselves blue from colloidal silver. We probably need real doctors. And because most folks don’t need a doctor all the time, we probably need health insurance. The current system is a handful of state-by-state monopolies. But we know (according to Metcalfe’s law) that the value of a network is proportional to the number of connected users on the system. It would seem the best way to dodge insurance marketplace inefficiencies like rising costs and low quality care would be to have the biggest network possible (say, 330 million people?) to create the best safety net. The market is not getting us the best price.</p>
<p><strong>Defense.</strong> Every American owning their own personal tank and missile system would be an inefficient stupid way to defend our country. It’s probably best to centralize the cost of Defense and hire trained armed service members for that purpose. I’m not advocating for more military –I’d personally prefer less– but security is a core need and it manifests at a nation-state level.</p>
<p><strong>Transportation.</strong> I don’t think individuals should plan and build their own highways. I’d like a government to do that. I also think every American owning their own car that sits parked 95% of the time is a waste of money and space, even if it does make the GDP chart go up. You need a big extra room to store cars at home and a downtown filled with concrete ramps to store cars at work. Or an enormous parking lot to store cars at the store. Is this not a form waste? There’s no way a train makes money and is a profitable business… but more trains equals less traffic. We know adding new <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2020/1/27/how-much-does-a-mile-of-road-actually-cost">ten million dollar a mile</a> lanes to an already impossibly wide interstate creates more traffic, more road rage, and more traffic deaths. That is folly and an inefficiency governments can step in and solve.</p>
<p><strong>Education.</strong> Education is a big expense. But you know what’s more expensive? Everyone being stupid. That’s a joke… partially. What is more expensive is everyone sourcing and paying for private schools; most parents would not do it. You’d end up with a future labor force with a lot less education. I think my biggest takeaway from school closures during COVID was how glad I am the public education system exists. Parents can work jobs, do commerce, and it allows kids to learn and play with other kids from a cross-section of incomes, ethnic groups, and special needs. The 1:20+ teacher-student ratio couldn’t be more efficient in regards to childcare. If anything we need more teachers and classrooms to keep that ratio as low as possible so education quality goes up. Oh, and school breakfasts and lunches are super efficient too. You can feed kids for like $1/kid, there’s no way I can hit those numbers at home. I can’t believe this is contentious. Let kids eat.</p>
<p><strong>Scientific Research.</strong> Space is expensive to get to, only billionaires can afford it. Isn’t it nice that the government sometimes foots the bill for scientists to also go? Beyond space, efforts like curing cancer, computer research, or finding a new species of spider… these are not an ultra-efficient use of funds but those discoveries power innovation. The market doesn’t fund Science unless it makes money in an A/B test. We’d end up with more patent-pending boner pills instead of understanding of our universe. Real science is a bunch of inefficient question and answer seeking that changes the course of human history.</p>
<p><strong>Human Rights.</strong> One way to drive down costs under Capitalism is to hire labor at the cheapest rate possible. Historically, our great nation has relied on slaves (yikes!) and children (yikes!) for cheap sources of labor. You’d have to work long hours for low pay and then a machine would cut off your arm and your employer would say “Well, you can’t work here anymore” and kick you out. Isn’t it great to have a government to correct this moral inefficiency? It didn’t happen overnight, of course. Countless churches and patriotic do-gooders were fine with justifying and upholding the old system. Even fought a war about it.</p>
<hr />
<p>I could keep going, but there’s a billion and one jobs a government can do to improve the life and well-being of its citizens. I guess I’m still thinking about efficiency… but from the opposite angle. A government is perhaps best-situated to absorb inefficiencies at scale. Will there be inefficiency and waste and kingdom-building within a super-system like a government? For sure. Systems should always seek to improve. To begin fixing those problems you need data and transparency.</p>
<p>The more you understand Capitalism, the more you understand it’s a game. It’s a game with an enormous exploit. I’m talking Blanka in the corner levels of bullshit. The government <em>should</em> exist to fix those systems and curb those bad actors. But the system continues to reward them and heap tax break after tax break as a reward to their fellow co-conspirators in exchange for campaign contributions and lavish trips. Talk about inefficiency. Dumping piles of money into the hands of people who already have money. Sheesh.</p>

Throughout now-president Donald Trump&#8217;s 2024 campaign, it was clear that his support was coming from three very different factions whose only shared ideology was a determination to destroy the federal government.

Saw a commercial on CNN this evening from <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/your-economic-partner">Ontario</a> in response to the tariffs, respectful, talking direct to Americans about the bonds with the people of Canada. Why can’t the Dems do this, say how important the independence of the FBI is, to start. We’d love to pay for that. Get in the game Dems.

## 2025-02-02 Dungeons and Wilderness and Politics

date: 2025-02-01, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-02-02-dungeons-and-wilderness-and-politics">2025-02-02 Dungeons and Wilderness and Politics</h1>

<p>Last year, I wrote that <a href="2024-08-19-rpg-intrigue">I&rsquo;d like to see a system for how to run an intrigue as a party</a>.
I think the core of that idea is in this paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What if B/X D&amp;D went levels 1–3 is for dungeons, 4–6 is for the wilderness and 7–9 is for politics. Doesn’t that sound fantastic? What sort of rules would you find in that third book? You would not get to name level by being a colonizer and clearing the land but by taking over an existing position of power – through intrigue. Oust the abbot, kick out the bishop, marry into the baron’s family, take over the guild. With the help of your friends. Without resorting to combat, but with dice rolling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/bjmurray">Brad J. Murray</a> saw this and started writing a document, riffing on the idea. He invited me to collaborate, I wrote some more, but then it didn&rsquo;t go anywhere. I&rsquo;m not sure what to do next. It&rsquo;s already much better than that vague idea I had, but it&rsquo;s not ready to be turned into a 20 page pamphlet. I feel that it&rsquo;s getting closer, though.</p>

<p>Since we weren&rsquo;t doing anything with the document, I figured I might as well post what we have. Perhaps you want to run with it? Make a copy, make some changes, let us know?</p>

<p>Here goes.</p>

<h2 id="premise">Premise</h2>

<p>Traditional dungeon and/or dragon games progress character in levels: discrete units of capability. Each is a steady increase in power, almost entirely in terms of how big a thing you can kill (or how easily you can kill a smaller thing). This creates a certain kind of play arc that can become tedious as you realise that narratively the same thing is happening, it’s just that the fights take longer. At least when it’s executed weakly, and it is very easy to execute it weakly.</p>

<p>Instead of a power scale, levels can be grouped into a thematic progression where you gain more power but the context in which you execute the power changes. In order to progress into the next tier, you must accomplish something that leads naturally into that tier.</p>

<p>The tiers are: from levels 1 through 3 you are in dungeons. Small(ish) set piece events in a structure full of enemies and loot. You acquire things, you kill things, and maybe you make some alliances within the dungeon context. The launching point of your dungeon excursions – a hamlet, a city, or what-have-you may reward you but certainly appreciates you and also keeps you informed of dungeons that need your attention.</p>

<p>From levels 4 through 6 you are in the wilderness. The enemies are a little more random and of more widely ranging power. Sometimes you need to fight but often you need to hide or run. You are trying to get from safe place to safe place navigating distinctly unsafe places between. You are acquiring knowledge of multiple communities, places, enemies and friends.</p>

<p>From levels 7 through 9 you are a leader. Your interests are political. You have gone from wandering between communities and serving them to attempting to create one or lead an existing one. Your interest is the well-being and even growth of a community in the context of a world with many desperate communities surrounded by dangerous wilderness. You will likely need to hire some dungeoneers and couriers. Pest control and deadly mail carriage.</p>

<p>At level 10 you turn into a patron or nemesis for the players of your next campaign.</p>

<p>Within a tier you become more powerful but in your tier context. In the wilderness you might become a little better at fighting but mostly you get better at navigating and hiding and planning. You become a rider of exotic mounts and become known for your successes. And maybe your failures. And in your political years you likely don’t get better at fighting at all but at organizing and communicating and planning and execution. You learn how to determine who you can trust and who you can’t.</p>

<h2 id="level-1-3-the-dungeon-years">Level 1-3: The Dungeon Years</h2>

<p>You will fight things for treasure and, eventually, to serve the needs of someone else.<br>
You will learn fighty things – how to defeat enemies and locate traps.<br>
You will develop a relationship with a home community.<br>
You will learn new tactics, new spells, new powers.</p>

<h3 id="making-the-home-community">Making the home community</h3>

<p>A handful of non-player characters, representative of surface factions. They need things from the dungeon. This results in retrieval missions, rewards, and rumours regarding the mission. Players see the community leaders they are helping (by selling them their loot) grow in power and manoeuvre, but likely they don’t care.</p>

<h3 id="making-a-dungeon">Making a dungeon</h3>

<p>The dungeons contain things that are useful to the patrons in the home community. The dungeon also has factions and faction leaders, like the home community, but these factions are there to be exploited by the players. Ally with these humanoids against these other humanoids or against the common enemies further down, those nightmare caricatures of our fellow humans – more cruel, more greedy, more hungry than we are. The dungeon is the terrible mirror of our fears.</p>

<p>(Needs more advice.)</p>

<h3 id="moving-on">Moving on</h3>

<p>At some point, the need arises to get help from a neighbouring community. A higher level magic-user is required to break a curse, cure a disease, reverse a petrification, or raise a dead comrade. This requires a trip overland and automatically ends the dependence on dungeon adventures.</p>

<h2 id="level-4-6-the-wilderness-years">Level 4-6: The Wilderness Years</h2>

<p>You will travel in the service of communities and eventually be sought for service and advice.<br>
You will learn desperate things — how to avoid danger, how to ambush, and how to survive the environment.<br>
You will make connections with communities.<br>
You will learn to act strategically, where to fight and where to yield, where to go and when to go.</p>

<h3 id="making-connected-communities-and-maps">Making connected communities and maps</h3>

<p>Distribute the following on the map:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Powerful people</strong>: Give them names, titles and retainers including spells and magic items. Some of them must have skills and spells such that somewhere between level 3 and 4 players need to travel. Breaking curses over here, curing diseases over there, a sage to identify a powerful magic item in that other place.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Settlements</strong>: Give them names, a small number of interesting buildings such as defensive structures and temples, and note the number of people ready to fight in case of a battle. The coming war will end wilderness exploration and those numbers will be important.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Ruins</strong>: Create more dungeons, big or small. Since dungeon exploration is no longer the core activity, think of these more as lairs. Most have just three to five zones that may or may not map to “rooms” with monsters and treasure. Dragon lairs, giant fortresses, bandit camps, druid covens, troll caves. The monsters are big and powerful, with area attacks like dragons, or large damage output, like giants, with the potential to destroy buildings and settlements, or they are contagious and hard to kill like undead and lycanthropes, or they are numerous and nefarious, taking hostages and setting ambushes.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Legendary items</strong>: As a consequence of treasure allocation for the above, some powerful magic items enter the sandbox and it’s good to have them on a separate list so that there can be rumours and quests pointing players towards them.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following create three separate, overlapping and contradicting networks of loyalties, providing for endless conflict and shifting alliances between powerful people.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Magic schools</strong>: This is where players get to learn higher level spells from legendary magic users. If you know their names, you can name their spell books (this is a copy of “Agrimach’s Grimoir of Necromancy” from back when he was a wandering battle mage) and players can go and visit them to learn more spells from the same school. Named spell collections also facilitate writing up spells for other magic-users since they can be former students with a subset of these spells.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Secret societies</strong>: Give them names and leaders. For each settlement figure out if the secret society has a presence and if so, who the representative is.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Gods &amp; demons and their temples</strong>: Give them names and themes. For each settlement, figure out if there is a shrine or temple and if so, who the head priest is.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that monsters show up in multiple guises, here.</p>

<p>There are the very dangerous foes living in the ruins mentioned above. These continue to be based on our nightmares: dragons spreading terror and devastation, undead sucking the life of the land, or giants making travel unsafe. The neighbouring communities need the players’ help, resulting in more wilderness travel. These are opponents that can be fought by the players, directly.</p>

<p>The remaining monsters have societies living in the settlements mentioned above, just like humans. A few of them live in dystopian societies that players would like to end: Slavers, brutalisers, dictatorships. It is important that there are many more neutral settlements, however. If all the orcs are brutal tribal savages and all the underground elves are matriarchal slavers, it’s too easy to draw up conflict along racial lines. It’s better to have one society of brutal savages looking for plunder and one society of slavers looking for victims and have the rest be fearful onlookers and “neutral” parties. Organising them, solving their problems and forging alliances is what this tier is about.</p>

<h3 id="community-objectives-and-you">Community objectives and you</h3>

<p>New factions emerge: secret societies, cults, political parties (clans, families). There are power struggles between them, observable from a distance (like the political careers of the village non-player characters). For their struggles, these factions need the help of players. Invasions have to be fought back, spying missions need to be carried out, treasure needs to be found (dungeon adventures don’t necessarily disappear, but the dungeons are far away and dangerous, necessitating travel through the wilderness.</p>

<h3 id="wilderness-encounters">Wilderness encounters</h3>

<p>Wilderness encounters do not happen in tiers like encounters in dungeon levels where deeper means tougher. The wilderness has no centre and no distance – unless there is a colonialist vision of a borderland and the non-human world is there for the taking. Like slavery, colonialism can be a topic to explore, but it’s better to be struggling against it than to glorify it. If there are slaves, players can free them and fight the slavers. If there are colonisers, players can stop the land grab and the massacres.</p>

<p>The monsters and lairs no longer reflect the nightmares of our childhood (monsters that eat us, monsters that take what’s ours, monsters that live in the darkness). Monsters now reflect the nightmares of our adult lives. Enemies have strongholds from where they sally out and attack our communities, disrupting our trade, plundering our villages, capturing our ships. Pirates and bandits, and monstrous equivalents. Conquering armies, occupational armies.</p>

<h3 id="moving-on-1">Moving on</h3>

<p>As the game progresses, things come to a head and the players cannot fight against hundreds of enemies on their own. Allies have to be found and it all culminates in a big battle or a series of battles. Mass combat rules are used. And when it’s over, when there’s a power vacuum, players are ready to move on and fill it.</p>

<h2 id="level-7-9-the-political-years">Level 7-9: The Political Years</h2>

<p>You will lead a community to wealth or ruin or maybe a little of both.<br>
You will learn how to navigate the pitfalls of leadership.<br>
You will command armies and governments.<br>
You will anchor yourself to something.<br>
You will fade away and make room for those that come after you.</p>

<h3 id="making-the-political-landscape">Making the political landscape</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Expand on the list of powerful people</strong>: Add family members. Families add another layer of overlapping and contradicting loyalties. Now every important person can be connected to a magic school, a secret society, a temple, and a family.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>A list of jobs</strong>: Every settlement, every important building, every right to harvest is a resource that results in a job for somebody, a step on the way up for people.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="making-your-community">Making your community</h3>

<p>Based on the lower tiers of the game, players have hopefully made alliances with powerful people and their families. Some ways to make them part of the community:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Family</strong>: Where as before players are mostly interested in their names and their abilities, now is the time to learn about their families. Family is always a mixed bag. Some of them have disturbing tendencies. How do you handle those without triggering a feud? Some of them need a better place. Can you take them in and care for them, offer them an education and a career? Meeting new people also means a chance for romantic interests. Will you be able to create a family of your own?<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Housing</strong>: The devastation of war and powerful monsters leads to refugees that need housing. How do you provide for the raw materials to build camps and to fortify these? How do you transform these improvised settlements into regular settlements?<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure</strong>: Building settlements, wells, walls, cisterns, granaries, towers, strongholds, roads, dams, aqueducts – this is the new normal. Sometimes the problems here still allow for short adventures. Road constructions are blocked because of an unnatural crocodile infestation. No stones are available because the quarry has been taken over by kobolds worshipping a medusa. Some of the problems need political resolutions, however: Perhaps the mine stopped working because revolutionaries incited the workers into revolt and indeed, their grievances are justified. Time to step in.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Tolls and taxes</strong>: Infrastructure takes an immense effort in gold and manpower. Soldiers need to guard the roads and man the strongholds. With travel secured, trade brings in revenue. As trade expands overseas and across mountain passes, securing it becomes more difficult. Ships have to be built. Soldiers need to be raised and equipped.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Jobs</strong>: With many people now depending on you, it’s important to pick the right advisors, the right second-in-commands.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Peace</strong>: At this point, people are exhausted from the war. They want peace. Even if problems could conceivably be resolved by going to war, they prefer not to. To solve problems by violent confrontation is now retrograde and frowned upon.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="threats-to-the-community-you-love">Threats to the community you love</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Corruption and betrayal</strong>: Whom do you trust? Loyalty is not a given. People will work for you until you hand them a settlement to run and they go rogue, allying themselves with stronger neighbours. People will work for you until you give them a post and then they’ll be corrupt, asking for bribes and posts for their family. How do you keep them in check and still get things done? How do you root out traitors without descending into paranoia and alienating your friends? How do you handle secret societies and cults?<br>
</li>
<li><strong>War</strong>: A war is no longer a question of mass combat rules used at the end of the previous tier. Player characters are usually not going on military expeditions. A single die roll determines whether armies win or lose battles, whether they advance or retreat. What players care about: How much reinforcements does the army need? How long are the supply lines and consequentially, how much of the reinforcements wither away before reaching the army? How many more battles will there be? How many refugees return from the war?</li>
<li><strong>Revolution</strong>: The machinations of economics produce inequalities. You need rich people to stay in power and yet rich people are the causes of revolution. Can you ensure an economy that can stand against your neighbours without sucking your people dry?</li>
<li><strong>Succession</strong>: You and your party rose to power but the world is complicated and strange. There are those who can handle it, but they need to learn how to do it – from you. And as they do, you&rsquo;ll find yourself more and more obsolete. Will you get the timing right? Will you raise people to power in times of need? Will you hold the reins until they are ready? And will you be able to let go when you&rsquo;re no longer up to the task?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="threats-to-the-people-you-love">Threats to the people you love</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Power</strong>: Can you manage a peaceful transition that doesn&rsquo;t end end with most of your family dead?</li>
<li><strong>Education</strong>: Can you raise your children to be the kind of people they want to be? Can you uplift your society to be the kind of citizens they want to be?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="adventures">Adventures</h3>

<p>Considering the means to build up a community and the threads the community faces as well as the people you love, consider the following checklists to generate political adventures.</p>

<h4 id="a-diplomatic-mission">A diplomatic mission</h4>

<p><strong>Why</strong>: To marry into a difficult family, to seal an alliance, to placate a pushy neighbour, to establish an embassy.</p>

<p><strong>Act 1, the people involved</strong>: Secure the consent of the parties involved. Does the bride or groom want to go? Does the diplomat want the job? Why not? Can you sweeten the deal? Does anybody next to them object – family, rivals? Can you placate them?</p>

<p><strong>Act 2, controlling public space</strong>: Travelling no longer means facing monsters but securing adequate lodgings for the entourage. Is somebody preventing the hosts from fulfilling their obligations? Can you send agents ahead of the troupe to get this resolved? If not, can you get it resolved in person without threatening violence? Alternatively, if you are hosting: Are there people in your community working against you? How will agents, heralds and advanced parties react? How do you prevent an escalation?</p>

<p><strong>Act 3, social dynamics</strong>. Is there a hunt, a feast or a joust to partake in? Do you recite poetry or sing? Do you have the right people in your employ to entertain the hosts or guests? What gifts will you exchange? If there are veiled insults, how will you handle them without violence?</p>

<p><strong>Act 4, diplomacy</strong>. Every demand, every offer, every deal is met with a counter. What do you have in return? How good are you at negotiating?</p>

<p><strong>Act 5, the financial aftermath</strong>. When everything is said and done, check your finances. Did you win or did you lose? Add up the successes and failures and compare them to the table of financial consequences. Do you need to borrow gold from merchants and bankers to pay for all the entertainment, the soldiers, the pageantry? If you have gold to spare, how will you spend it? Or will you be saving it?</p>

<h4 id="a-protracted-war">A protracted war</h4>

<p><strong>Why</strong>: To gain notoriety and glory, to increase your holdings and thereby gain positions of power to hand to loyal followers.</p>

<p>(Insert acts.)</p>

<h4 id="a-rebellion-to-counter">A rebellion to counter</h4>

<p><strong>Why</strong>: To secure a hold on an institution or a settlement that you have recently gained but are in danger of losing again.</p>

<p>(Insert acts.)</p>

<h3 id="ending">Ending</h3>

<p>A successful, peaceful transfer of power to the next in line is the crowning achievement. The monarchist way to win is to found a family, have children and pass power to them. The republican way to win is to found an organisation that can sustain itself. The religious way to win is to steer the institution and its community through these troubled times and then to live out those last years in peace. Players win when peace and stability reigns, at least for a few years.</p>

<p>The rules for war ensure that losses can be recovered from by betting more of what you have. Increase the stakes. At first, you send a second-in-command and some soldiers to take back those villages. Then you send reinforcements. You build roads to improve the supply lines. Perhaps there’s a betrayal and you must send your child to take back control – or you must go yourself. And if you lose then, your life’s work collapses. Players lose when civil war and ruin follows a long period of upheavals.</p>

## Pixelfed should be designed like a lightly gated garden

<p><a href="https://pixelfed.social/?ref=a.wholelottanothing.org" rel="noreferrer">Pixelfed</a> is a federated instance compatible with Mastodon and geared towards photographs.

Even if Congress doesn't do anything to rein in Musk and Trump, the stock market will have something to say on Monday, one assumes. And this might be one time to hope for a market crash.

I rewrote the <a href="https://oursocialweb.org/">oursocialweb.org</a> home page. It needed to focus on linking. The term web is being thrown around too casually, without regard to what the web is, the same kind of dilution that's happening with podcasting. But the <i>social web</i> idea is fairly new, and it's really important that we get this right.

## ★ As if Anyone Needed Further Proof, Patrick Soon-Shiong’s Los Angeles Times Is Now a Propaganda Rag (and They’re Bad at HTML)

date: 2025-02-01, updated: 2025-02-02, from: Daring Fireball

You can’t see the link or click on it as rendered in a browser, because there’s no content between the opening `<a …>` and closing `</a>` tags, but whoever at the LA Times edited Reinhart’s column to pervert its meaning, did so sloppily, leaving behind at least this one acerbic vestigial link from his originally-submitted prose.

Will there be any tech companies that aren't wholly owned by Musk, Inc. Will owning things even mean anything? Or is this the beginning of the rule of the tech bros, world wide. I can't imagine what they're planning for us. In the meantime, me divesting my Tesla, which seemed so urgent just 24 hours ago, now seems like a powerless gesture. I heard it said that now feels like the moment in Covid when you realized everything was about to freeze, and you'd better head to the supermarket right now, and when you got there, you found you weren't among the first to see it this way. I was very reassured by the blog post that Krugman did. It's nice to hear a sane voice out there.

## 2025-01-27 Using rsync with Sqlite databases

date: 2025-02-01, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-01-27-using-rsync-with-sqlite-databases">2025-01-27 Using rsync with Sqlite databases</h1>

<p>I use Debian stable so my copy of Sqlite is not the latest and greatest.
At the same time, I don&rsquo;t use Borg Backup for my server. I use rsync.</p>

<p>I copy the content of the important server files to my local laptop
and then I make a backup of my laptop to external disks using Borg Backup.</p>

<p>When making copies using rsync, the database must not be in use.
Otherwise, a busy database is probably going to be corrupt when restoring
it from backup.</p>

<p>The key is to stop all programs using database files before beginning the
backup and restarting them after the backup. It&rsquo;s also important to stop
these programs using the monitoring software.</p>

<p>I use Monit to monitor the server. If I don&rsquo;t stop the programs using
Monit, Monit will discover that they are not running and restart them
while rsync is still copying the database file. The GoToSocial database
is 10G so copying it takes a long time. Long enough for Monit to discover
that GoToSocial isn&rsquo;t running to restart it.</p>

<p>The programs using database files:</p>

<ul>
<li>GoToSocial</li>
<li>fail2ban</li>
<li>The Lounge</li>
</ul>

<p>Watch the log files for messages saying that files changed.</p>

<p>This is my script:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

# sibirocobombus.root is defined in ~/.ssh/config

echo Stopping GoToSocial
ssh sibirocobombus.root monit stop gotosocial

echo Stopping fail2ban
ssh sibirocobombus.root monit stop fail2ban

echo Stopping The Lounge
ssh sibirocobombus.root monit stop thelounge

echo Backing up Sibirocobombus

## 2025-01-31 BorgBackup for the laptop and the server

date: 2025-02-01, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-01-31-borgbackup-for-the-laptop-and-the-server">2025-01-31 BorgBackup for the laptop and the server</h1>

<p>A few days ago I mentioned the <a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/2025-01-27-rsync-sqlite">rsync-based backup script</a> I use to copy data from the server to the laptop.</p>

<p>The backup script that makes backups of my laptop (including the backup from the server) to external disks is different, however.</p>

<p>My actual backup uses external disks. I have two of them. One of them is always at the office. Every now and then (not often enough!) I make a backup to the external disk I have at hand and then I carry it to the office and bring the other one back. That is, the laptop and the two external disks are never in the same location.</p>

<p>The two external disks I use are &ldquo;known backup disks&rdquo;. When I plug them in, BorgBackup immediately starts making a backup.
I discussed this setup <a href="2017-12-24_Borg_Backup">back in 2017</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just going to repost the stuff and I don&rsquo;t think there have been any significant changes.</p>

<p>Run commands and create files as root.</p>

<p>Either use <code>sudo</code> for every command you run, or use <code>sudo su</code> once and do everything as root.
No matter how you do it, the danger zone awaits!</p>

<h2 id="mnt-backup"><code>/mnt/backup</code></h2>

<p>Create the mount point on the laptop:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir /mnt/backup
</code></pre>

<h2 id="etc-fstab"><code>/etc/fstab</code></h2>

<p>Any disk labeled “Backup” will be mounted as <code>/mnt/backup</code>:</p>

<pre><code>LABEL=Backup /mnt/backup auto nosuid,nodev,nofail,noauto,x-gvfs-show 0 0
</code></pre>

<h2 id="etc-backups-40-backup-rules"><code>/etc/backups/40-backup.rules</code></h2>

<p>Install a symlink to this file:</p>

<pre><code>ln -s /etc/backups/40-backup.rules \
      /etc/udev/rules.d/40-backup.rules
</code></pre>

<p>The file content:</p>

<pre><code>ACTION==&quot;add&quot;, SUBSYSTEM==&quot;bdi&quot;, DEVPATH==&quot;/devices/virtual/bdi/*&quot;, TAG+=&quot;systemd&quot;, ENV{SYSTEMD_WANTS}=&quot;automatic-backup.service&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>This makes sure that the service <code>automatic-backup</code> starts whenever an external disk gets plugged into the laptop.</p>

<h2 id="etc-backups-automatic-backup-service"><code>/etc/backups/automatic-backup.service</code></h2>

<p>Install a symlink to this file:</p>

<pre><code>ln -s /etc/backups/automatic-backup.service \
      /etc/systemd/system/automatic-backup.service
</code></pre>

<p>The service does nothing except start the <code>run.sh</code> shell script.</p>

<pre><code>[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/etc/backups/run.sh
</code></pre>

<h2 id="etc-backups-backup-disks"><code>/etc/backups/backup.disks</code></h2>

<p>The <code>run.sh</code> below runs for every external disk plugged in.
It&rsquo;s important to only make backups to known backup disks, however.</p>

<p>The known backup disks are identified by their <code>uuid</code> in the <code>backup.disks</code> file.</p>

<p>To list the disk labels and their <code>uuid</code>:</p>

<pre><code>lsblk -o+uuid,label
</code></pre>

<p>Add the <code>uuid</code> to the <code>/etc/backups/backup.disks</code> file.</p>

<p>This is the content of the file identifying my backup disks, for example:</p>

<pre><code># generate using: lsblk -o+uuid,label
7c478832-5d7f-43d3-9b79-20cfc67fb0e6
bb1c034e-dd21-48e7-a496-1b95685a094d
156cf4df-aa58-421e-b3d0-583fe6fdff4a
</code></pre>

<p>If you create your copy of the file, your uuids will be different!</p>

<p>When you run <code>lsblk -o+uuid,label</code> you&rsquo;ll also see the device itself. In my case, that&rsquo;s <code>/dev/sdb</code>.
Create a BorgBackup repository on the new disk, mount it, create the directory and initialize the repository.</p>

<p>When initializing the repository, you&rsquo;re asked for a passphrase. You will need it for the <code>run.sh</code> script.</p>

<pre><code>mount /dev/sdb /mnt/backup
mkdir /mnt/backup/borg-backups
borg init --encryption=repokey --progress /mnt/backup/borg-backups/backup.borg
umount /mnt/backup
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure the disk has the correct label!
You can do this from the command-line but I used <a href="https://apps.gnome.org/en/DiskUtility/">Disks</a>.</p>

<h2 id="etc-backups-run-sh"><code>/etc/backups/run.sh</code></h2>

<p>Now we&rsquo;re ready for the actual script. It checks whether a known backup disk is mounted under <code>/mnt/backup</code> and if so, it creates a new archive in the repository.</p>

<p>Don’t forget to search for <code>BORG_PASSPHRASE</code> and change it to whatever you used when you ran <code>borg init</code> above!</p>

<p>Hide the passphrase from everybody else and to make it executable:</p>

<pre><code>chmod 0700 run.sh
</code></pre>

<p>This the content of the shell script:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash -ue

# The udev rule is not terribly accurate and may trigger our service before
# the kernel has finished probing partitions. Sleep for a bit to ensure
# the kernel is done.
#
# This can be avoided by using a more precise udev rule, e.g. matching

It has just been announced that at the Spring 2025 Membership Meeting of the <a href="https://cni.org/">Coalition for Networked Information</a> in Milwaukee, WI April 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup>, Vicky and I are to receive the <a href="https://www.cni.org/about-cni/awards/pep-award">Paul Evan Peters Award</a>. The press release announcing the award is <a href="https://www.cni.org/news/lockss-co-founders-honored-with-2025-paul-evan-peters-award">here</a>.<br />
<br />
Vicky and I are honored and astonished by this award. Honored because it is the premiere award in the field, and astonished because we left the field more than seven years ago to take up our new full-time career as grandparents.  We are all the more astonished because we are not even eligible for the award; the <a href="https://www.cni.org/about-cni/awards/pep-award">rules clearly state that</a> the "award will be granted to <b>an individual</b>".<br />
<br />
You can tell this is an extraordinary honor from the list of previous awardees, and the fact that it is the first time it has been awarded in successive years. Vicky and I are extremely grateful to the <a href="https://arl.org">Association of Research Libraries</a>, <a href="https://cni.org">CNI</a> and <a href="https://www.educause.edu/">EDUCAUSE</a>, who sponsor the award.<br />

Part of the award is the opportunity to make an extended presentation to open the meeting.  The text of our talk, entitled <i>Lessons From LOCKSS</i>, with links to the sources and information that appeared on slides but was not spoken, should appear here on April 7<sup>th</sup>.<br />
<br />
The work that the award recognizes was not ours alone, but the result of a decades-long effort by the entire <a href="https://www.lockss.org">LOCKSS team</a>. It was made possible by support from the LOCKSS community and many others, including Michael Lesk then at NSF, Donald Waters then at the Mellon Foundation, the late Karen Hunter at Elsevier, Stanford's Michael Keller and CNI's Cliff Lynch.<br />

I've been using <a href="https://claude.ai/">claude.ai</a> for programming work lately, and it does one thing better than ChatGPT. It reads your code and tries to mimic your coding style. ChatGPT won't do that. It's really frustrating to have to edit their code before I can even try it out. I like it and am paying the $20 per month in addition to the money I'm paying ChatGPT.

## Advice to would-be platform vendors

date: 2025-01-31, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>TL;DR: The key to success is convincing developers to ignore the fact that you will eventually kill them.</p>
<p>Would-be platform vendors, open or not, in order to entice a developer to learn how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quick success. Hello World works in less than 30 minutes. Hopefully much less.</li>
<li>Easy to believe that the platform vendor won't want to kill me. This is a trick, because based on my experience, they always try to kill you, eventually. </li>
<li>Fun. If I can fill a need that I think users will want, without being resented too much by the platform vendor then I might take a jump knowing full well that the better the idea the quicker the vendor will kill me. For that reason it's better to do something they don't understand, or will see as irrelevant, ie a "third party opportunity." As soon as it appears to be "system software," that's when they started the project to eat your lunch. ;-)</li>
<li>The API works the way you think. This has been the highest hurdle for me to get over in most platforms I think about working with. I can't tell you how many times I've stared at the docs for a platform and have no idea how it relates to the product, which I know how to use. The concepts should mirror the functionality of the system it's the API for. Too much theory and I have to be very very motivated for other reasons to get through the fog. </li>
<li>It must be relatively easy for you to hang out in a corner where it's too hard for them to be worth the trouble.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thing is if there is a platform vendor, they <i>can</i> kill you, no matter what they say. I once had a big platform vendor say they weren't trying to crush me. I could see on his face he realized he had just given up their plan, or how else would that term be in his head as applied to me. Never mind, I was already commited so what difference did it make. </p>
<p>The reason for all this is that as they grow, platform vendors hire employees to work on this stuff, and they resent independent developers. This surprised me when I first encountered it. I thought we were siblings, brothers and sisters. But they idealize our situation and only see the pain in theirs. So they will enjoy killing you. It will eventually happen. That's why it's generally much better if there is <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22platform+without+a+platform+vendor%22+site%3Ascripting.com">no platform vendor</a>. </p>

## 2025-01-21 Sabotage

date: 2025-01-31, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-01-21-sabotage">2025-01-21 Sabotage</h1>

<p>The <a href="/pdfs/OSS%20Simple%20Sabotage%20Field%20Manual.pdf">OSS Simple Sabotage Field Manual</a> a short 20 page read.
There&rsquo;s a cleaned up version <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Simple_Sabotage_Field_Manual">on Wikisource</a>.
It was written by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Strategic_Services">Office of Strategic Services</a> (OSS), a precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) during the second world war for propaganda and subversion.</p>

<p>It might help you make the right decision if you&rsquo;re put in a tight spot. 😬</p>

<p>It might help you see your co-workers in a new light. 😄</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Politics">#Politics</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Sabotage">#Sabotage</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been posting extracts every now on then on fedi.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sabotage varies from highly technical <em>coup de main</em> acts that require detailed planning and the use of specially trained operatives, to innumerable simple acts which the ordinary individual citizen-saboteur can perform. This paper is primarily concerned with the latter type. Simple sabotage does not require specially prepared tools or equipment; it is executed by an ordinary citizen who may or may not act individually and without the necessity for active connection with an organized group; and it is carried out in such a way as to involve a minimum danger of injury, detection, and reprisal. &ndash; <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Simple_Sabotage_Field_Manual/Introduction">OSS Simple Sabotage Manual, Introduction</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It think it is important to place a premium on minimizing the dangers.
There&rsquo;s no point in becoming a casualty in the fight against fascism.
There&rsquo;s no point in losing your job or your life to a fascist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A second type of simple sabotage requires no destructive tools whatsoever and produces physical damage, if any, by highly indirect means. It is based on universal opportunities to make faulty decisions, to adopt a non-cooperative attitude, and to induce others to follow suit. Making a faulty decision may be simply a matter of placing tools in one spot instead of another. A non-cooperative attitude may involve nothing more than creating an unpleasant situation among one’s fellow workers, engaging in bickerings, or displaying surliness and stupidity. &ndash; <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Simple_Sabotage_Field_Manual/Introduction">OSS Simple Sabotage Manual, Introduction</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes you read this manual and start wondering about the people you meet, co-workers, customers, human resources departments, the whole chain of command.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s to hoping that you and your team are exempt. 😁</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Acts of simple sabotage are occurring throughout Europe. An effort should be made to add to their efficiency, lessen their detectability, and increase their number. Acts of simple sabotage, multiplied by thousands of citizen-saboteurs, can be an effective weapon against the enemy. Slashing tires, draining fuel tanks, starting fires, starting arguments, acting stupidly, short-circuiting electric systems, abrading machine parts will waste materials, man-power, and time. Occurring on a wide scale, simple sabotage will be a constant and tangible drag on the war effort of the enemy. &ndash; <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Simple_Sabotage_Field_Manual/Possible_Effects">OSS Simple Sabotage Manual, Possible Effects</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>To be part of the constant and tangible drag is the point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Widespread practice of simple sabotage will harass and demoralize enemy administrators and police. Further, success may embolden the citizen-saboteur eventually to find colleagues who can assist him in sabotage of greater dimensions. Finally, the very practice of simple sabotage by natives in enemy or occupied territory may make these individuals identify themselves actively with the United Nations war effort, and encourage them to assist openly in periods of Allied invasion and occupation. &ndash; <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Simple_Sabotage_Field_Manual/Possible_Effects">OSS Simple Sabotage Manual, Possible Effects</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure who our allies are but one thing&rsquo;s for sure: in times of trouble we should be looking for allies at all levels of organisation. And that means doing the work of maintaining relationships.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The ordinary citizen very probably has no immediate personal motive for committing simple sabotage. Instead, he must be made to anticipate indirect personal gain, such as might come with enemy evacuation or destruction of the ruling government group. Gains should be stated as specifically as possible for the area addressed: simple sabotage will hasten the day when … and … deputies … will be thrown out, when particularly obnoxious decrees and restrictions will be abolished, … and so on. Abstract verbalizations about personal liberty, freedom of the press, and so on, will not be convincing in most parts of the world. In many areas they will not even be comprehensible. &ndash; <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Simple_Sabotage_Field_Manual/Motivating_the_Saboteur">OSS Simple Sabotage Manual, Motivating the Saboteur</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s a stark reminder to read that “personal liberty, freedom of the press, and so on, will not be convincing” but I think I see it at work, now.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is because the people around me don’t depend on “personal liberty” for anything. They are free to do as they want because they want what the new regime is doing. If you want what you are told there is no need for liberty.</p>

<p>Similarly, if your means are so constrained and everything around you requires money and power, then personal liberty is so constrained that you don’t fear it’s loss.</p>

<p>And for people to want the free press, it’d be nice if the press didn’t already tow the party line of money and power.</p>

<p>I guess in a roundabout way I am trying to say that all dictatorship requires a large part of the population to acquiesce to it. The movies might make one think that most people are in the resistance but in fact they are not. Many are just interested in Ruhe und Ordnung, silence and order.</p>

<p>Sadly, when I first heard about the US sliding into fascism thirty years ago, I thought it impossible. Unthinkable. And yet here we are.</p>

<p>Perhaps it helps to think about a sliding scale from zero to Hitler. The US is not yet invading Poland. But they seem to be ready to divvy up Ukraine; or take Greenland. So where are we: 60%? 70%?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying don&rsquo;t do it. I&rsquo;m not saying to be insubordinate and get fired so that you could be replaced by a fascist.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m saying do it slower and with more hand holding.</p>

<p>Do it in a way that requires more approvals, and reviews, and &ldquo;oops we need to roll that build back because we made a mistake&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be good at your job when your job is supporting fascism.<br>
– zzzzBov, <a href="https://github.com/uswds/uswds-site/pull/3078#issuecomment-2626183794">in a comment</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m just hoping that when the orders come, I too will be able to stall and drag.</p>

Let someone else ride around in this car that I love, but hate because it is a symbol of American terrorism and apartheid.  This is compatible with my understanding that hate is love that was betrayed. I'm sure I won't love its replacement as much as I loved the Model Y, but I will feel better about driving it. And Tesla shareholders will, I hope, learn the lesson that products must be politically agnostic in order to work commercially. Or if you must take a stand, make it <i>against</i> fascism. So many of our oligarchs have made the wrong bet here. We will never forget what Zuckerberg, Bezos, the CEOs of Apple, Microsoft, Open AI -- all these companies went the wrong way.

## Miscellany № 105: blog questions challenge

<p>There is something interesting happening with blogging. For a long time, blogs like this one were <em>the</em> way to opine, to share, to bloviate. Then social media came along and stole blogging’s thunder, with the average blogger gravitating towards long threads on Twitter (<abbr class="initialism">RIP</abbr>; † ⚰; 💀; etc., etc.) or photo-heavy Instagram posts. Next came newsletters — blogs delivered by email, essentially — which finally broke the social media hegemony.</p><a class="more-link" href="https://shadycharacters.co.uk/2025/01/miscellany-105-blogging-questions-challenge/">Read more →</a>

Nighttime Pembroke College, Cambridge on a chilly January night. I arrived early, and instead of waiting in the cold for my host decided to sit in the chapel where an orphan scholar was practising.

## 2025-01-23 The bots are at it again

date: 2025-01-30, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-01-23-the-bots-are-at-it-again">2025-01-23 The bots are at it again</h1>

<p>For a while I just appended new graphs and data to <a href="2024-11-25-emacs-china">the last post on this topic</a>.
This time around I feel it&rsquo;s worse. There are so many bots that I can&rsquo;t even do the WHOIS lookup any more.
Or perhaps I just managed to block so few that I never realized how many more there were.
In any case, now that I&rsquo;m speeding things up, there are more bots to block.</p>

<p><strong>If you want to partake in unsupervised banning with no feedback, no due process, just automatic ban-hammers, take a look at this script full of firewall commands.</strong></p>

<p>It needs ipset and iptables access: <a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a>.</p>

<p>I blocked another 4669 networks.</p>

<p>What I did was get the most recent 10000 lines from the Apache access log, filter out all the requests for my GoToSocial instance (hoping that it has good defences!?), grepping for the magic word, <a href="/admin/network-lookup-lean">doing reverse lookups</a> using <code>asn.routeviews.org</code> and banning them all. Looking at a summary, there were two networks with 6 requests, 6 networks with 5 requests, etc. Of the 4669 networks banned, there were 3985 networks with a single request only.</p>

<p>That is to say, the network lookup is not really all that efficient because the requests are so incredibly diverse. There are essentially no individual IP numbers to ban because there are no repeat offenders, and even with that great ban-hammer of mine, this wouldn&rsquo;t help against the next 85% of requests because they are all unique.</p>

<p>Now, I was already banning about 10,000 networks yesterday, and their success rate is still 85%! So that tells you that even this little jousting I&rsquo;m doing is tilting at windmills because these bots are turning the web to shit.</p>

<p>Summing the numbers I see that I looked at 10,000 requests, discarded all the hits for my GoToSocial instance and still had 5560 bot hits.</p>

<p>Every website everywhere is paying the distributed price for these leeches to keep their projects running. Of course, I could rent a bigger machine, run a bigger cache, spending more money and more time for their scam.</p>

<p>I keep shouting &ldquo;CO₂ for the CO₂ god!&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s part of it, yes… Sadly!</p>

<p>Oh, and I could not post this on fedi because my GoToSocial instance is unable to cope and takes a very long time to recover from the onslaught. While I waited, I banned another 2184 networks. And I kept doing it.</p>

<p>Fuck this shit.</p>

<p>Fuck this whole generation.</p>

<p>Time passes.</p>

<p>Let me count how many entries I added today.</p>

<pre><code>awk 'BEGIN {c=0; n=0} /^# 2025-01-23/ {c=1} c&amp;&amp;/^ipset/ {n++} END {print n}' \
  bin/admin/ban-cidr
14497
</code></pre>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s about time to add some fail2ban code.
If only I knew how.
More cost they are putting on every single site operator and service provider out there.</p>

<p>Right now load is below 4, so that&rsquo;s not too bad for 2 cores.
The sites are still sluggish. I some sort of congestion issue.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-01-23-bots-devouring-the-web-1.jpg" alt="Netstats showing connections established spiking." /></p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23ButlerianJihad">#ButlerianJihad</a></p>

<p><strong>2025-01-24</strong>. What I did all day, yesterday:</p>

<pre><code># prefix with a timestamp
date; tail -n 2000 /var/log/apache2/access.log \
 | grep -v ^social \
 | grep &quot;rcidonly&quot; \
 | bin/admin/network-lookup-lean &gt; result.log
# count
grep ipset result.log|wc -l
# add
grep ipset result.log|sh
# document
grep ipset result.log&gt;&gt;bin/admin/ban-cidr
</code></pre>

<p>But today:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-01-23-bots-devouring-the-web-2.jpg" alt="After midnight, load climbed up to 40 and stayed up there" /></p>

<p>I think made a mistake, yesterday around midnight. I rebooted the server and didn&rsquo;t run the script! 😱</p>

<p>I thought the packages <code>netfilter-persistent</code>, <code>iptables-persistent</code> and <code>ipset-persistent</code> took care of that but that is not the case. See below for more.</p>

<p>In any case, I think the graphs above illustrates what happens to my server without the firewall rules.</p>

<p>Grrr.</p>

<p>They said we&rsquo;re running out of IPv4 numbers but now that I&rsquo;m trying to block bots descending like flesh flies on baby bison, it turns out that there are still thousands of networks that need blocking. Holy cow may Baal eat the eyes of all the engineers partaking in this scouring of the web; may all the project managers rot and lose their teeth, their nails, their hair and their sense of smell; let them all suffer these curses until they repent, until they mend their ways and help undo the damage they are wreaking.</p>

<p><strong>Later that day</strong>. I got an email asking about the bots and so I looked at the last run.
Let&rsquo;s take the last run:</p>

<pre><code>$ head result.log
Made 763 DNS requests.
21 cache hits.
Range                          |       Hits |
------------------------------:|-----------:|
                       unknown |          4 |
                38.188.60.0/24 |          3 |
                201.46.36.0/22 |          3 |
                45.225.53.0/24 |          2 |
              170.246.119.0/24 |          2 |
               45.178.110.0/23 |          2 |
</code></pre>

<p>The top hitting network I blocked in the last run had made just <em>three</em> suspicious requests!</p>

<p>There is more info below:</p>

<pre><code>38.188.60.0/24
38.188.60.92 38.188.60.70 38.188.60.70
38.188.60.0/24 | 38.188.60.92 | 24/Jan/2025:11:57:58 +0100 | GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;days=3&amp;rcidonly=Comments_on_VimMode&amp;showedit=0 HTTP/1.1 | Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/88.0.4324.150 Safari/537.36
38.188.60.0/24 | 38.188.60.70 | 24/Jan/2025:11:58:47 +0100 | GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;from=1730419325&amp;rcidonly=profh&amp;showedit=1 HTTP/1.1 | Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/73.0.3683.86 Safari/537.36
38.188.60.0/24 | 38.188.60.70 | 24/Jan/2025:12:01:02 +0100 | GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;days=3&amp;rcidonly=2013-11-08&amp;showedit=1 HTTP/1.1 | Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/100.0.3478.83 Safari/537.36
ipset add banlist 38.188.60.0/24
</code></pre>

<p>So the three requests from this network came from just two different IP numbers:</p>

<ul>
<li>38.188.60.92</li>
<li>38.188.60.70</li>
</ul>

<p>The first suspicious request is for a list of recent changes made in the last 3 days for the page &ldquo;Comments on VimMode&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s check whether this is a false positive. Perhaps the request belongs into a sequence that makes sense to a human?</p>

<pre><code>$ grep 38.188.60.92 /var/log/apache2/access.log /var/log/apache2/access.log.1 
/var/log/apache2/access.log:www.emacswiki.org:443 38.188.60.92 - - [24/Jan/2025:11:57:58 +0100] &quot;GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;days=3&amp;rcidonly=Comments_on_VimMode&amp;showedit=0 HTTP/1.1&quot; 503 3868 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/88.0.4324.150 Safari/537.36&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>This strange request is the only request this IP number made in over 24h.</p>

<p>The only explanation I have is that the URL belongs to a dataset used to train AI, using bots running from machines rented all around the world.
Or it&rsquo;s a denial of service attack.</p>

<p><strong>2025-01-25</strong>. I think I finally understand the packages about making it all persistent:</p>

<p><code>netfilter-persistent</code> calls all the modules.</p>

<p><code>iptables-persistent</code> is the module that saves <code>/etc/iptables/rules.v4</code> and <code>/etc/iptables/rules.v6</code> with just the rules.</p>

<p><code>ipset-persistent</code> is the module that saves <code>/etc/iptables/ipsets</code>.
This file is about 1MB and pretty much contains what <code>ban-cidr</code> contains.</p>

<p>And as it turns out, saving is never automatic.</p>

<p>You need to run <code>netfilter-persistent save</code> manually after running <code>ban-cidr</code> for all the rules and sets to be loaded on a reboot.</p>

<p>Similar stories in the news:</p>

<p>I like this guy.</p>

<p>If you want to read the original answers by @tante, see his blog post, <a href="https://tante.cc/2025/01/28/quoted-in-ars-technicas-article-on-tarpits-for-ai-crawlers/">Quoted in Ars Technica’s article on tarpits for AI crawlers</a>.</p>

<p>All I&rsquo;ll say is that I fear something like Nepenthes will just tie up too many resources of mine (RAM, file handles, bandwidth). &ldquo;CO₂ for the CO₂ god!&rdquo; But perhaps I&rsquo;m wrong? I should investigate.</p>

<p>Although <a class="account" href="https://octodon.social/@wim_v12e" title="@wim_v12e@octodon.social">@wim_v12e</a> commented, saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no way that something like Nephentes would ever be deployed at a scale so large that it would create considerable additional emissions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For now, I keep returning a 410 &ldquo;Gone&rdquo; response to self-identified bots and I just drop packets from networks that have hosted bots at the firewall. There are probably problems with this system as packets from fediverse instances hosted by the same providers get cut off, too. And I&rsquo;m not expiring the bans, unfortunately.</p>

## 2025-01-30 Gender and language

date: 2025-01-30, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-01-30-gender-and-language">2025-01-30 Gender and language</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m always positively surprised when I see the <a href="https://www.bk.admin.ch/bk/de/home/dokumentation/sprachen/hilfsmittel-textredaktion/leitfaden-zum-geschlechtergerechten-formulieren.html">guidelines on gender-neutral writing</a> by the Federal Chancellery in Switzerland, with German, French, Italian and Rumantsch being full of those pesky gender thingies.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://mutual.tls.zone/@robbo" title="@robbo@mutual.tls.zone">@robbo</a> then linked me to a book in French about inclusive language. I liked the blurb very much. Like Portuguese, the language has a rule that if a group of people is all women, use female forms, but if there just one man, no matter how many women there are, use male forms. The blurb says how this pushes women out of the public sphere because they are no longer perceived as doing anything. And the blurb says that the speakers of a language have a choice! We can change, and our language can change. It belongs to the speakers who are alive now, not to the dead of the past.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>En 1647, Claude Favre de Vaugelas, l’un des premiers membres de l’Académie française, écrit que « le genre masculin, étant le plus noble, doit prédominer toutes les fois que le masculin et le féminin se trouvent ensemble ». Une opinion partagée par d’innombrables penseurs des XVIIe et XVIIIe siècle qui envoie balancer la croyance populaire selon laquelle le masculin l’emporte sur le féminin parce qu’il est générique, neutre ou universel. Le féminin grammatical, ainsi que les formes féminines des noms de métiers, ont été sciemment éclipsées pour pousser les femmes hors de la sphère publique, pour les empêcher de se nommer, peut-être même de se penser. … Mais les francophones n’ont pas dit leur dernier mot! Les multiples stratégies d’écriture inclusive déjà répandues témoignent de la révolution langagière que nous connaissons et qui défonce les barrières artificielles érigées par les académiciens. … Cet ouvrage sert d’introduction à l’écriture inclusive, de traité d’histoire sur l’influence du sexisme sur la langue, mais surtout de formidable outil pour quiconque cherche à écrire en ne laissant personne dans l’ombre. &ndash; <a href="https://editionssommetoute.com/livre/grammaire-pour-un-francais-inclusif/">Grammaire pour un français inclusif</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a bit related to discussions around the other languages I speak: Is German German more German than Swiss or Austrian German? Is Continental Portuguese more Portuguese than Brazilian Portuguese? Is English English more English than Indian English or Irish English? No! The language belongs to those who speak it.</p>

## Fake Reddit and WeTransfer Sites are Pushing Malware

date: 2025-01-30, updated: 2025-01-30, from: Bruce Schneier blog

## I Was a Teenage Exocolonist

date: 2025-01-30, from: Jessica Smith's blog

<p>Over the past few days I&rsquo;ve been <em>obsessed</em> with this game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1148760/I_Was_a_Teenage_Exocolonist/" title="Steam store page for I Was a Teenage Exocolonist">I Was a Teenage Exocolonist<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&thinsp;<svg style="height: 0.7em; width: 0.7em;" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="external-link-alt" class="svg-inline--fa fa-external-link-alt fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><title>(external link)</title><path fill="currentColor" d="M432,320H400a16,16,0,0,0-16,16V448H64V128H208a16,16,0,0,0,16-16V80a16,16,0,0,0-16-16H48A48,48,0,0,0,0,112V464a48,48,0,0,0,48,48H400a48,48,0,0,0,48-48V336A16,16,0,0,0,432,320ZM488,0h-128c-21.37,0-32.05,25.91-17,41l35.73,35.73L135,320.37a24,24,0,0,0,0,34L157.67,377a24,24,0,0,0,34,0L435.28,133.32,471,169c15,15,41,4.5,41-17V24A24,24,0,0,0,488,0Z"></path></svg></span></a>. It&rsquo;s set in, like, a socialist colony on an alien planet, with lots of gender &amp; sexual diversity and even polyamorous representation (hell yes!). But also, it&rsquo;s a time loop game – you&rsquo;re supposed to play through it more than once, using the knowledge your character gains each run to make better choices the next time around. I finished my first run today (which took me 11.4 hours over four days&hellip; hooked, I have been) and I&rsquo;m really excited to play the next one. It also has a beautiful art style and great soundtrack!</p>
<p>The only thing is, while I was trying to avoid spoilers (which I usually never do! Usually I&rsquo;m like &ldquo;gimme that walkthrough&rdquo; but with this one I wanted to experience it first) I did read a lot of reviews that were like, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re basically doomed to a bad ending on your first run,&rdquo; but I became&hellip; a teacher. And because I had a rebellion score of 100/100, I became the best kind of teacher who teaches the kids to &ldquo;question everything&rdquo;. I mean, there had been a lot of tragic deaths in the first half of my run, but the ending itself didn&rsquo;t really seem bad. Maybe what people meant is that the ending didn&rsquo;t magically undo the tragic deaths, idk. I did see one review which was like, &ldquo;this game is the worst, it didn&rsquo;t warn me I needed at least one skill at 100/100 by the end of the game&rdquo; but I had like&hellip; five skills at 100/100; this was not a high bar to clear. I have <em>now</em> looked up the list of possible endings and honestly, I don&rsquo;t even know what you get if you didn&rsquo;t have any skills at 100&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and then the <em>other</em> thing was that the character I&rsquo;d been trying to romance fuckin&rsquo; <span class="spoiler">planted a bomb and peaced out for the last year or something of the game. Disappeared, never to be seen again</span>. So I guess I have an idea for what I want to focus on next time.</p>

There's a great moment in Woody Allen's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeper_(1973_film)">Sleeper</a> where a time traveler was told that the world was destroyed when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2fYguIX17Q&t=130s">Albert Shanker</a> got hold of a nuclear warhead. If you lived in NYC in the 70s and 80s you knew <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Shanker">Albert Shanker</a> as a NY character like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Sharpton">Al Sharpton</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Sliwa">Curtis Sliwa</a>.  New York <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Hernandez">had</a> its own semi-celebrities, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani">people</a> who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Morrow">were</a> famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Breslin">mostly</a> in New York, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bella_Abzug">but</a> not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Koch">as</a> much <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lindsay">outside</a>. So Albert Shanker with a nuclear weapon kind of fit his character as a bomb throwing type in city politics in an extreme way. A fitting and comic way for us to end it all. Proof that god has a sense of humor. It was an inside reference only NYers would get. Well in case you didn't know it, back in that time or a little later, Trump was one of those Albert Shanker types. And yes, now again he has all the nuclear weapons. And it still feels like he's only famous in a mediocre Queens real estate way. Isn't that weird?

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-01-29, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

We're programmed to believe big companies make things the right way and individual people can't be trusted. We're going to have to break out of that rut, to stop trusting them so much. It's like the 2008 banking crisis, but this time they've taken over the government, not just the economy. The tech industry, believe it or not, started with assumption that it was the other way around. That people were the brilliance, and companies started wars to make money (we were the generation that stopped the Vietnam war, btw). I got into computers because I thought I could earn a living that way, but quickly discovered how inherently subversive they are. They weren't just for the nerds with the plastic pocket protectors, they were also for hippies. Some of us are still here and we want to create with you.

We don't have to wait for big companies to do it for us. We can work together. That's how we rise to the challenges we share. We can flip this bad situation around, turning problems into opportunity. Big changes happen now. We can steer in the direction we want to go.

## ExxonMobil Lobbyist Caught Hacking Climate Activists

<p>The Department of Justice is investigating a lobbying firm representing ExxonMobil for <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/24/nx-s1-5271530/hacking-investigation-climate-change">hacking</a> the phones of climate activists:</p>
<blockquote><p>The hacking was allegedly commissioned by a Washington, D.C., lobbying firm, <a href="https://legacy.www.documentcloud.org/documents/25501845-250113-usa-v-forlit/">according to a lawyer representing the U.S. government</a>. The firm, in turn, was allegedly working on behalf of one of the world&#8217;s largest oil and gas companies, based in Texas, that wanted to discredit groups and individuals involved in climate litigation, according to the lawyer for the U.S. government. In court documents, the Justice Department does not name either company...</p></blockquote>

## 2025-01-29 Tangara

date: 2025-01-29, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-01-29-tangara">2025-01-29 Tangara</h1>

<p>I joined the kickstarter a long time ago and got the device yesterday. The package was nice. It works. The menu looks good – always tricky with a wheel user interface. My 16GiB SD card works, all I had to so was reformat it using a VFAT file-system (whatever the Gnome Disks app suggested). The device came semi-charged so it worked immediately. Something rattles when I shake it. Maybe it’s the button? There is some sort of haptic feedback with the UI which surprised me. The UI doesn’t dim or go dark with inactivity, there’s a switch to do it. I guess I like it. The music sounds great with my old Sennheiser Monument cable-only headphones.</p>

## How is Deepseek R1 on a Raspberry Pi?

date: 2025-01-28, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">How is Deepseek R1 on a Raspberry Pi?</span>

            <p></p>

<p>OpenAI, which is only really open about <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/07/11/sam-altman-oklo-ipo-spac-openai-nuclear-microreactors-green-energy/">consuming all the world's energy</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/21/tech/openai-oracle-softbank-trump-ai-investment/index.html">half a trillion of our taxpayer dollars</a>, just got rattled to its core.</p>

<p>Deepseek, a new AI startup run by a Chinese hedge fund, <em>allegedly</em> created a new open weights model called R1 that beats OpenAI's best model in every metric.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-01-28, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I thought this excerpt from <a href="https://contrarian.substack.com/p/departing-the-new-york-times">Krugman's piece</a> about his move back to blogging was right on. "For a while I tried to make up for the loss of the blog with threads on Twitter. But even before Elon Musk Nazified the site, tweet threads were an awkward, inferior substitute for blog posts." There's a need for a system that combines the full-featured writing of blogging and the timelines of twitter-like systems.

## iPad at 15: Hit or a Miss?

date: 2025-01-28, from: Om Malik blog

Yesterday slipped away, and I never got a chance to mark the 15th birthday of the iPad, perhaps one of the most misunderstood products in Apple’s lineup. The confusion over the device is not limited to reviewers or buyers but extends to Apple itself, which hasn’t really been able to give it the direction it &#8230;

## 15 Minutes

date: 2025-01-28, from: Dave Rupert blog

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sMZdQaKcqs4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>This might be my favorite song of all time. It’s by a slightly obscure Chicago punk band called The Broadways, made up of a couple members from the more well-known ska band Slapstick. It’s got everything you want in a punk song. Palm mutes, open meedly-meedly parts, yelling, speed, a half-time breakdown, and impeccable synchronicity. I listen to this song when I’m sad, when I’m frustrated, when I’m in traffic, and when I need to inject high octane fuel into my veins. The soaring octave chords will always pick me back up again.</p>
<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="markdown">All on the streets, the signs read
Cheaper and better technology
This capitalist vision is my nightmare

Put up a sign in my face
What the fuck happened to this place?
I think we made a wrong turn
Look at the lovely concrete

I drove to my stupid job today
Got stopped at an intersection
Fifteen minutes of my life just rolled away

Looked at the guy next to me
He didn't look too happy
No one's happy, but everyone's too busy to see

Let's go shopping today
Drive our fancy cars to the fancy malls
And for lunch we'll have Big Macs

I wish I could turn the clock back
Back to when I was ten
When I wasn't scared of everything
And everything wasn't so fucking crowded

And I wonder if my kid will ever see the horizon
Untouched by billboards and shopping malls
And I wonder if this crazy world
Thinks I'm the one that's crazy

What if I'm the one who's crazy?
What if I'm the one who's crazy?
What if I'm the one who's crazy?
What if I'm the one who's crazy?
I'm not crazy, just frustrated
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>WIthout a doubt, this song from my teenage years subliminally shaped a lot of my views on what’s wrong with the world. Capitalist intrusions. Eyeball monetization. The always upgrade tech cycle. Why I hate crowds. And traffic. Life evaporating at a stop light seems like a criminal waste of humanity to me. This may subconsciously be part of why I work from home.</p>
<p>I’ll never live up to my punk rock ideals or my teenage self, but this song takes me back to them. Not to “when I was ten”, but to “when I was seventeen” for sure. Driving through big city Houston at night. Going to Food Not Bombs near the abandoned hospital. All it takes is the first verse and BOOM! I’m transported through time and I can see the world through my old anarcho-tinted glasses. It makes you want to smash systems and break concrete.</p>

## Is Bluesky billionaire-proof?

date: 2025-01-28, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Could what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk">happened</a> to Twitter, happen there?</p>
<p>To determine, ask yourself if you could continue to use it if it was acquired by a billionaire for their own personal political use?</p>
<p>What would you switch to?</p>
<p>Would you have to give up your history and followers?</p>
<p>And developers, what would you do if the billionaire acquirer dropped support for the api? How expensive and time consuming would it be to convert to a different protocol? Would you even bother?</p>
<p>We’ve learned a lot from the billionaire acquisition of twitter. The answer to these questions made a lot of us think we’d never want to do this again. But despite all the misleading hype, we very much are repeating the mistakes.</p>
<p>The current owners of Bluesky would be crazy if they closed off the opportunity to get rich. But they shouldn’t be misleading users and developers into believing that it’s safe to trust this as an open platform that couldn’t be acquired and have its utility consumed the way twitter's was.</p>
<p>This started as a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3lgsgmmhyf22q">thread</a> on Bluesky of course. :-)</p>
<p>PS: Spoiler -- Bluesky is, as it is currently configured, not billionaire-proof. It's going to get acquired, it probably already has, based on what they're doing. Remember, pay attention to what they do, not what they say. It's just as true in tech as it is in politics, and these days, what's the difference anyway? </p>
<p>PPS: If you're thinking ahh but there's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol">AT Protocol</a>, our ace in the hole. Please. Twitter had an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter#Technology">API</a> too. It didn't make a difference. And AT Proto won't either unless there are proven systems that people are actually using that peer with Bluesky's servers, so those users can't be sold to the billionaire. We're nowhere near that. No one can say with any certainty that it's even possible. At this point the continued support of the API is entirely up to the owners of Bluesky. They could change it, break developers or completely drop it and the users and developers would have no recourse. </p>
<p>PPPS: Can you imagine the founders of Bluesky wouldn't take $20 million each for their share? </p>

## CISA Under Trump

date: 2025-01-28, updated: 2025-01-28, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Jen Easterly is out as the Director of CISA. Read her final <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/big-interview-jen-easterly-cisa-cybersecurity/">interview</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s a lot of unfinished business. We have made an impact through our ransomware vulnerability warning pilot and our pre-ransomware notification initiative, and I&#8217;m really proud of that, because we work on preventing somebody from having their worst day. But ransomware is still a problem. We have been laser-focused on PRC cyber actors. That will continue to be a huge problem. I&#8217;m really proud of where we are, but there&#8217;s much, much more work to be done. There are things that I think we can continue driving, that the next administration, I hope, will look at, because, frankly, cybersecurity is a national security issue...</p></blockquote>

## Don't pay $800 for Apple's 2TB SSD upgrade

## Rivers on Bluesky

date: 2025-01-27, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>This is a post for longtime Scripting News readers. As you know, I've been doing feed readers for a long time. They've been mostly organized around the <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22river%20of%20news%22">river of news</a> concept, which also happens to be the way twitter-like systems work. My rivers are built around <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> and formats that interop with RSS. </p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/19/basketball.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Then I got one of the ideas out of the blue that at first didn't make sense, but then the more I thought about the better the idea seemed. It came from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mcuban.bsky.social">Mark Cuban</a>, who liked one of my posts on Bluesky, it was about some FeedLand rivers I had produced, and then I did what I often do -- I offered to do something like that for him. For obvious reasons I don't need to go into here, you all are smart or you wouldn't be reading this. :-)</p>
<p>Anyway -- he said "I'd use that if it were on Bluesky." </p>
<p>My first thought, ridiculous -- can't be done. They have all these limits that aren't present in HTML. I don't have any idea how I could make this work. Here's a <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/01/27/riverInFeedlandScreenshot.png">screen shot</a> of what a river looks like in FeedLand. </p>
<p>But then after a few hours or days, the idea developed, as often happens, and I decided it might work and was worth a try. </p>
<p>So I wrote a piece of software that hooked into FeedLand's outbound news flow, and picked out stories from the right feeds, and shot them over to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/feediverse.bsky.social">an account on Bluesky</a>. Thanks to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mcuban.bsky.social">Cuban</a>, who linked to it from his million+ follower account, it has 7.6K followers. It uses the list of feeds in my <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=blogroll">blogroll</a> on Scripting News to feed the river. I think it's a really good pioneering effort, with quite a few followers who are active. And it's going to stay running for the indefinite future. That was in December. </p>
<p>Now I've gone a step further, and generalized the code so I can have N of these rivers instead of just one. And to prove it works, I now have two new rivers on Bluesky. </p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dave.feediverse.org">dave.feediverse.org</a> -- the <a href="https://news.scripting.com/?tab=dave">Dave tab</a> on my news site. It subscribes to all the RSS feeds I generate. My linkblog, Scripting News, even my YouTube channel which has an RSS feed. Chuck Shotton requested this. It was a good idea so it was the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dave.feediverse.org">first new river</a> I did on Bluesky. Went on the air just yesterday and now has 10 followers. </li>
<li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nba.feediverse.org">nba.feediverse.org</a> -- then my project for this morning is to do the same thing for the NBA. I'm a huge Knicks fan, and basically love all of the NBA. People say the Knicks must win a championship, but I say who cares. If they keep playing at this level, with new castmembers all the time, with the track record of current management, I'm a totally happy campter. If we won a championship all the more exciting, but after all those years in the wilderness, it's so nice to finally after all this time to have a great NBA team in NY (and sorry the Nets don't count). Anyway, there's nothing more really to say. If you like basketball, and use Bluesky -- <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nba.feediverse.org">here's</a> what you follow. </li>
</ol>
<p>One more thing -- no federation here folks. It's very simple. No new formats or protocols, built entirely on the tried-and-true RSS and OPML formats for feeds and subscription lists. (And of course support for Atom and RDF too.)</p>
<p>I'm glad Mark Cuban asked me to try this path, it provides something I hadn't thought of. Not just inbound feeds for Bluesky, inbound rivers. All we need now is Markdown support, and then a <a href="https://textcasting.org/">few more things</a>, and we'll be back to where we were in 1997. :-)</p>

## What is a sanctuary city?

date: 2025-01-27, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I wonder if people understand what a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary_city">sanctuary city</a> is. </p>
<ul>
<li>In a sanctuary city the local government accepts the fact that there are people living in the city who are not there legally. </li>
<li>They want these people to be able to call the police without fear of being turned into the feds. Otherwise crime would go unreported and that would create much larger problems. </li>
<li>They want the children of these people, who are often American citizens, to be able to go to school, again without having the parents reported to the feds. If they didn't guarantee that, the kids wouldn't be in school, and we all lose by having uneducated adults. It's a core principle of this country that educated citizens are a good thing.</li>
<li>They want them to be able to get health care, to go to a hospital when someone is seriously ill or injured. This is partly for pragmatic reasons, to slow disease spreading, and also because we are a rich country and keeping people healthy is a good thing, just like education. What other purpose could a government have? (A fair question for Republicans, one they probably wouldn't want to answer truthfully.) </li>
</ul>
<p>The Republican talking points make it sound like local governments that declare as sanctuary cities are weak or immoral or anti-American, but that is not what's going on. You couldn't run a city with huge crimes commited against illegals because they would be so vulnerable, and kids need education, and everyone needs health care. Yet I hear the word used all the time in public discourse, and am concerned that most people don't know what it means. </p>

## New VPN Backdoor

date: 2025-01-27, updated: 2025-02-01, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>A newly discovered <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/backdoor-infecting-vpns-used-magic-packets-for-stealth-and-security/">VPN backdoor</a> uses some interesting tactics to avoid detection:</p>
<blockquote><p>When threat actors use backdoor malware to gain access to a network, they want to make sure all their hard work can&#8217;t be leveraged by competing groups or detected by defenders. One countermeasure is to equip the backdoor with a passive agent that remains dormant until it receives what&#8217;s known in the business as a &#8220;magic packet.&#8221; On Thursday, researchers revealed that a never-before-seen backdoor that quietly took hold of dozens of enterprise VPNs running Juniper Network&#8217;s Junos OS has been doing just that...</p></blockquote>

## A story about pans

date: 2025-01-26, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>The other day I sent my wife a link to <a href="https://madeincookware.com/products/ceramic-frying-pan/set">a new set of ceramic pans</a> and asked, “What do you think?” assuming she’d be as impressed as I was of the picture of eggs sliding off the pan. Her response: a grimace. Using my sixteen years of husbandly intuition, I surmised that we were not on the same page about kitchenware.</p>
<p>For context, my wife has had the same stainless steel pans that her parents bought her since we met. They’ve outlasted the fancier non-stick pans we’ve auditioned. Her opinion of the pans is that they’re high-quality because they’ve lasted so long and still work. And from that perspective she’s right, they technically still work… but not without some downsides.</p>
<p>When you use stainless steel pans instead of non-stick pans, you’re committing to stickiness and having a harder time cleaning your pans. I can accept that as an incurred cost. I think my bigger issue is that ALL our pans do this. Even our cast irons which we’ve made thousands of batches of bacon with but still aren’t seasoned. If you make scrambled eggs, about two eggs worth of material forms a brown sheet of crust on the bottom of the pan that I must scrape off but NOT using soap per the laws of properly seasoning a cast iron pan.</p>
<p>Anyways, my wife and I aren’t seeing eye-to-eye on the pans and I’m kind of struggling to see why. I think there’s some frugalness afoot and possibly some sentimental attachment to items that were gifts. And then she –with her Deanna Troi, betazoid-levels of empathy– said “You probably think we need new ones because you do the dishes” and that was our ah-ha moment!</p>
<p>In our house I’m the self-appointed dish-master because I can hyperfocus on them while listening to an audiobook, pairing something I don’t like with something I do like. My perspective on the pans is that they’re a lot of work to clean up every night. Scraping and scrubbing the charred chunky bits off so we can ruin them the next day. Essentially, I operate at a different end of the “stack” of dishes than she does so we see the situation differently. I have bigger feelings about the stickiness of the pans because that’s the part that I interface with the most. I would like to apply non-stick technology to improve the dish-washing process. Where she sees something that works okay and we’ve had for a long time, while I see a maintenance burden.</p>
<p>Now we have an end-to-end/cross-team perspective of our pans and that is valuable. We understand each other’s needs on a micro-level (the pans are too sticky) and the macro-level (one side of the stack inherits more burden with our pan choice) and that’s helpful for framing future conversations about pans. That said, I don’t think we’re getting new pans any time soon. Such is life. Not all decisions are technical ones.</p>
