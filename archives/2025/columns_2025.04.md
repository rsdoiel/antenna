It has just been announced that at the Spring 2025 Membership Meeting of the <a href="https://cni.org/">Coalition for Networked Information</a> in Milwaukee, WI April 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup>, Vicky and I are to receive the <a href="https://www.cni.org/about-cni/awards/pep-award">Paul Evan Peters Award</a>. The press release announcing the award is <a href="https://www.cni.org/news/lockss-co-founders-honored-with-2025-paul-evan-peters-award">here</a>.<br />
<br />
Vicky and I are honored and astonished by this award. Honored because it is the premiere award in the field, and astonished because we left the field more than seven years ago to take up our new full-time career as grandparents.  We are all the more astonished because we are not even eligible for the award; the <a href="https://www.cni.org/about-cni/awards/pep-award">rules clearly state that</a> the "award will be granted to <b>an individual</b>".<br />
<br />
You can tell this is an extraordinary honor from the list of previous awardees, and the fact that it is the first time it has been awarded in successive years. Vicky and I are extremely grateful to the <a href="https://arl.org">Association of Research Libraries</a>, <a href="https://cni.org">CNI</a> and <a href="https://www.educause.edu/">EDUCAUSE</a>, who sponsor the award.<br />

Part of the award is the opportunity to make an extended presentation to open the meeting.  The text of our talk, entitled <i>Lessons From LOCKSS</i>, with links to the sources and information that appeared on slides but was not spoken, should appear here on April 7<sup>th</sup>.<br />
<br />
The work that the award recognizes was not ours alone, but the result of a decades-long effort by the entire <a href="https://www.lockss.org">LOCKSS team</a>. It was made possible by support from the LOCKSS community and many others, including Michael Lesk then at NSF, Donald Waters then at the Mellon Foundation, the late Karen Hunter at Elsevier, Stanford's Michael Keller and CNI's Cliff Lynch.<br />

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-01-31, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I've been using <a href="https://claude.ai/">claude.ai</a> for programming work lately, and it does one thing better than ChatGPT. It reads your code and tries to mimic your coding style. ChatGPT won't do that. It's really frustrating to have to edit their code before I can even try it out. I like it and am paying the $20 per month in addition to the money I'm paying ChatGPT.

## Advice to would-be platform vendors

date: 2025-01-31, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>TL;DR: The key to success is convincing developers to ignore the fact that you will eventually kill them.</p>
<p>Would-be platform vendors, open or not, in order to entice a developer to learn how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quick success. Hello World works in less than 30 minutes. Hopefully much less.</li>
<li>Easy to believe that the platform vendor won't want to kill me. This is a trick, because based on my experience, they always try to kill you, eventually. </li>
<li>Fun. If I can fill a need that I think users will want, without being resented too much by the platform vendor then I might take a jump knowing full well that the better the idea the quicker the vendor will kill me. For that reason it's better to do something they don't understand, or will see as irrelevant, ie a "third party opportunity." As soon as it appears to be "system software," that's when they started the project to eat your lunch. ;-)</li>
<li>The API works the way you think. This has been the highest hurdle for me to get over in most platforms I think about working with. I can't tell you how many times I've stared at the docs for a platform and have no idea how it relates to the product, which I know how to use. The concepts should mirror the functionality of the system it's the API for. Too much theory and I have to be very very motivated for other reasons to get through the fog. </li>
<li>It must be relatively easy for you to hang out in a corner where it's too hard for them to be worth the trouble.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thing is if there is a platform vendor, they <i>can</i> kill you, no matter what they say. I once had a big platform vendor say they weren't trying to crush me. I could see on his face he realized he had just given up their plan, or how else would that term be in his head as applied to me. Never mind, I was already commited so what difference did it make. </p>
<p>The reason for all this is that as they grow, platform vendors hire employees to work on this stuff, and they resent independent developers. This surprised me when I first encountered it. I thought we were siblings, brothers and sisters. But they idealize our situation and only see the pain in theirs. So they will enjoy killing you. It will eventually happen. That's why it's generally much better if there is <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22platform+without+a+platform+vendor%22+site%3Ascripting.com">no platform vendor</a>. </p>

## 2025-01-21 Sabotage

date: 2025-01-31, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-01-21-sabotage">2025-01-21 Sabotage</h1>

<p>The <a href="/pdfs/OSS%20Simple%20Sabotage%20Field%20Manual.pdf">OSS Simple Sabotage Field Manual</a> a short 20 page read.
There&rsquo;s a cleaned up version <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Simple_Sabotage_Field_Manual">on Wikisource</a>.
It was written by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Strategic_Services">Office of Strategic Services</a> (OSS), a precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) during the second world war for propaganda and subversion.</p>

<p>It might help you make the right decision if you&rsquo;re put in a tight spot. 😬</p>

<p>It might help you see your co-workers in a new light. 😄</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Politics">#Politics</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Sabotage">#Sabotage</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been posting extracts every now on then on fedi.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sabotage varies from highly technical <em>coup de main</em> acts that require detailed planning and the use of specially trained operatives, to innumerable simple acts which the ordinary individual citizen-saboteur can perform. This paper is primarily concerned with the latter type. Simple sabotage does not require specially prepared tools or equipment; it is executed by an ordinary citizen who may or may not act individually and without the necessity for active connection with an organized group; and it is carried out in such a way as to involve a minimum danger of injury, detection, and reprisal. &ndash; <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Simple_Sabotage_Field_Manual/Introduction">OSS Simple Sabotage Manual, Introduction</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It think it is important to place a premium on minimizing the dangers.
There&rsquo;s no point in becoming a casualty in the fight against fascism.
There&rsquo;s no point in losing your job or your life to a fascist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A second type of simple sabotage requires no destructive tools whatsoever and produces physical damage, if any, by highly indirect means. It is based on universal opportunities to make faulty decisions, to adopt a non-cooperative attitude, and to induce others to follow suit. Making a faulty decision may be simply a matter of placing tools in one spot instead of another. A non-cooperative attitude may involve nothing more than creating an unpleasant situation among one’s fellow workers, engaging in bickerings, or displaying surliness and stupidity. &ndash; <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Simple_Sabotage_Field_Manual/Introduction">OSS Simple Sabotage Manual, Introduction</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes you read this manual and start wondering about the people you meet, co-workers, customers, human resources departments, the whole chain of command.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s to hoping that you and your team are exempt. 😁</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Acts of simple sabotage are occurring throughout Europe. An effort should be made to add to their efficiency, lessen their detectability, and increase their number. Acts of simple sabotage, multiplied by thousands of citizen-saboteurs, can be an effective weapon against the enemy. Slashing tires, draining fuel tanks, starting fires, starting arguments, acting stupidly, short-circuiting electric systems, abrading machine parts will waste materials, man-power, and time. Occurring on a wide scale, simple sabotage will be a constant and tangible drag on the war effort of the enemy. &ndash; <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Simple_Sabotage_Field_Manual/Possible_Effects">OSS Simple Sabotage Manual, Possible Effects</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>To be part of the constant and tangible drag is the point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Widespread practice of simple sabotage will harass and demoralize enemy administrators and police. Further, success may embolden the citizen-saboteur eventually to find colleagues who can assist him in sabotage of greater dimensions. Finally, the very practice of simple sabotage by natives in enemy or occupied territory may make these individuals identify themselves actively with the United Nations war effort, and encourage them to assist openly in periods of Allied invasion and occupation. &ndash; <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Simple_Sabotage_Field_Manual/Possible_Effects">OSS Simple Sabotage Manual, Possible Effects</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure who our allies are but one thing&rsquo;s for sure: in times of trouble we should be looking for allies at all levels of organisation. And that means doing the work of maintaining relationships.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The ordinary citizen very probably has no immediate personal motive for committing simple sabotage. Instead, he must be made to anticipate indirect personal gain, such as might come with enemy evacuation or destruction of the ruling government group. Gains should be stated as specifically as possible for the area addressed: simple sabotage will hasten the day when … and … deputies … will be thrown out, when particularly obnoxious decrees and restrictions will be abolished, … and so on. Abstract verbalizations about personal liberty, freedom of the press, and so on, will not be convincing in most parts of the world. In many areas they will not even be comprehensible. &ndash; <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Simple_Sabotage_Field_Manual/Motivating_the_Saboteur">OSS Simple Sabotage Manual, Motivating the Saboteur</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s a stark reminder to read that “personal liberty, freedom of the press, and so on, will not be convincing” but I think I see it at work, now.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is because the people around me don’t depend on “personal liberty” for anything. They are free to do as they want because they want what the new regime is doing. If you want what you are told there is no need for liberty.</p>

<p>Similarly, if your means are so constrained and everything around you requires money and power, then personal liberty is so constrained that you don’t fear it’s loss.</p>

<p>And for people to want the free press, it’d be nice if the press didn’t already tow the party line of money and power.</p>

<p>I guess in a roundabout way I am trying to say that all dictatorship requires a large part of the population to acquiesce to it. The movies might make one think that most people are in the resistance but in fact they are not. Many are just interested in Ruhe und Ordnung, silence and order.</p>

<p>Sadly, when I first heard about the US sliding into fascism thirty years ago, I thought it impossible. Unthinkable. And yet here we are.</p>

<p>Perhaps it helps to think about a sliding scale from zero to Hitler. The US is not yet invading Poland. But they seem to be ready to divvy up Ukraine; or take Greenland. So where are we: 60%? 70%?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying don&rsquo;t do it. I&rsquo;m not saying to be insubordinate and get fired so that you could be replaced by a fascist.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m saying do it slower and with more hand holding.</p>

<p>Do it in a way that requires more approvals, and reviews, and &ldquo;oops we need to roll that build back because we made a mistake&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be good at your job when your job is supporting fascism.<br>
– zzzzBov, <a href="https://github.com/uswds/uswds-site/pull/3078#issuecomment-2626183794">in a comment</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m just hoping that when the orders come, I too will be able to stall and drag.</p>

Let someone else ride around in this car that I love, but hate because it is a symbol of American terrorism and apartheid.  This is compatible with my understanding that hate is love that was betrayed. I'm sure I won't love its replacement as much as I loved the Model Y, but I will feel better about driving it. And Tesla shareholders will, I hope, learn the lesson that products must be politically agnostic in order to work commercially. Or if you must take a stand, make it <i>against</i> fascism. So many of our oligarchs have made the wrong bet here. We will never forget what Zuckerberg, Bezos, the CEOs of Apple, Microsoft, Open AI -- all these companies went the wrong way.

<p>Here we are on an artichoke farm in coastal California, a place where migrant workers would normally be doing low-pay back-breaking work to pick the artichokes we could eat in our salads and antipasto. </p>

## Miscellany № 105: blog questions challenge

date: 2025-01-31, from: Shady Characters blog

<p>There is something interesting happening with blogging. For a long time, blogs like this one were <em>the</em> way to opine, to share, to bloviate. Then social media came along and stole blogging’s thunder, with the average blogger gravitating towards long threads on Twitter (<abbr class="initialism">RIP</abbr>; † ⚰; 💀; etc., etc.) or photo-heavy Instagram posts. Next came newsletters — blogs delivered by email, essentially — which finally broke the social media hegemony.</p><a class="more-link" href="https://shadycharacters.co.uk/2025/01/miscellany-105-blogging-questions-challenge/">Read more →</a>

## 2025-01-23 The bots are at it again

date: 2025-01-30, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-01-23-the-bots-are-at-it-again">2025-01-23 The bots are at it again</h1>

<p>For a while I just appended new graphs and data to <a href="2024-11-25-emacs-china">the last post on this topic</a>.
This time around I feel it&rsquo;s worse. There are so many bots that I can&rsquo;t even do the WHOIS lookup any more.
Or perhaps I just managed to block so few that I never realized how many more there were.
In any case, now that I&rsquo;m speeding things up, there are more bots to block.</p>

<p><strong>If you want to partake in unsupervised banning with no feedback, no due process, just automatic ban-hammers, take a look at this script full of firewall commands.</strong></p>

<p>It needs ipset and iptables access: <a href="/admin/ban-cidr">ban-cidr</a>.</p>

<p>I blocked another 4669 networks.</p>

<p>What I did was get the most recent 10000 lines from the Apache access log, filter out all the requests for my GoToSocial instance (hoping that it has good defences!?), grepping for the magic word, <a href="/admin/network-lookup-lean">doing reverse lookups</a> using <code>asn.routeviews.org</code> and banning them all. Looking at a summary, there were two networks with 6 requests, 6 networks with 5 requests, etc. Of the 4669 networks banned, there were 3985 networks with a single request only.</p>

<p>That is to say, the network lookup is not really all that efficient because the requests are so incredibly diverse. There are essentially no individual IP numbers to ban because there are no repeat offenders, and even with that great ban-hammer of mine, this wouldn&rsquo;t help against the next 85% of requests because they are all unique.</p>

<p>Now, I was already banning about 10,000 networks yesterday, and their success rate is still 85%! So that tells you that even this little jousting I&rsquo;m doing is tilting at windmills because these bots are turning the web to shit.</p>

<p>Summing the numbers I see that I looked at 10,000 requests, discarded all the hits for my GoToSocial instance and still had 5560 bot hits.</p>

<p>Every website everywhere is paying the distributed price for these leeches to keep their projects running. Of course, I could rent a bigger machine, run a bigger cache, spending more money and more time for their scam.</p>

<p>I keep shouting &ldquo;CO₂ for the CO₂ god!&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s part of it, yes… Sadly!</p>

<p>Oh, and I could not post this on fedi because my GoToSocial instance is unable to cope and takes a very long time to recover from the onslaught. While I waited, I banned another 2184 networks. And I kept doing it.</p>

<p>Fuck this shit.</p>

<p>Fuck this whole generation.</p>

<p>Time passes.</p>

<p>Let me count how many entries I added today.</p>

<pre><code>awk 'BEGIN {c=0; n=0} /^# 2025-01-23/ {c=1} c&amp;&amp;/^ipset/ {n++} END {print n}' \
  bin/admin/ban-cidr
14497
</code></pre>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s about time to add some fail2ban code.
If only I knew how.
More cost they are putting on every single site operator and service provider out there.</p>

<p>Right now load is below 4, so that&rsquo;s not too bad for 2 cores.
The sites are still sluggish. I some sort of congestion issue.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-01-23-bots-devouring-the-web-1.jpg" alt="Netstats showing connections established spiking." /></p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23ButlerianJihad">#ButlerianJihad</a></p>

<p><strong>2025-01-24</strong>. What I did all day, yesterday:</p>

<pre><code># prefix with a timestamp
date; tail -n 2000 /var/log/apache2/access.log \
 | grep -v ^social \
 | grep &quot;rcidonly&quot; \
 | bin/admin/network-lookup-lean &gt; result.log
# count
grep ipset result.log|wc -l
# add
grep ipset result.log|sh
# document
grep ipset result.log&gt;&gt;bin/admin/ban-cidr
</code></pre>

<p>But today:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-01-23-bots-devouring-the-web-2.jpg" alt="After midnight, load climbed up to 40 and stayed up there" /></p>

<p>I think made a mistake, yesterday around midnight. I rebooted the server and didn&rsquo;t run the script! 😱</p>

<p>I thought the packages <code>netfilter-persistent</code>, <code>iptables-persistent</code> and <code>ipset-persistent</code> took care of that but that is not the case. See below for more.</p>

<p>In any case, I think the graphs above illustrates what happens to my server without the firewall rules.</p>

<p>Grrr.</p>

<p>They said we&rsquo;re running out of IPv4 numbers but now that I&rsquo;m trying to block bots descending like flesh flies on baby bison, it turns out that there are still thousands of networks that need blocking. Holy cow may Baal eat the eyes of all the engineers partaking in this scouring of the web; may all the project managers rot and lose their teeth, their nails, their hair and their sense of smell; let them all suffer these curses until they repent, until they mend their ways and help undo the damage they are wreaking.</p>

<p><strong>Later that day</strong>. I got an email asking about the bots and so I looked at the last run.
Let&rsquo;s take the last run:</p>

<pre><code>$ head result.log
Made 763 DNS requests.
21 cache hits.
Range                          |       Hits |
------------------------------:|-----------:|
                       unknown |          4 |
                38.188.60.0/24 |          3 |
                201.46.36.0/22 |          3 |
                45.225.53.0/24 |          2 |
              170.246.119.0/24 |          2 |
               45.178.110.0/23 |          2 |
</code></pre>

<p>The top hitting network I blocked in the last run had made just <em>three</em> suspicious requests!</p>

<p>There is more info below:</p>

<pre><code>38.188.60.0/24
38.188.60.92 38.188.60.70 38.188.60.70
38.188.60.0/24 | 38.188.60.92 | 24/Jan/2025:11:57:58 +0100 | GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;days=3&amp;rcidonly=Comments_on_VimMode&amp;showedit=0 HTTP/1.1 | Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/88.0.4324.150 Safari/537.36
38.188.60.0/24 | 38.188.60.70 | 24/Jan/2025:11:58:47 +0100 | GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;from=1730419325&amp;rcidonly=profh&amp;showedit=1 HTTP/1.1 | Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/73.0.3683.86 Safari/537.36
38.188.60.0/24 | 38.188.60.70 | 24/Jan/2025:12:01:02 +0100 | GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;days=3&amp;rcidonly=2013-11-08&amp;showedit=1 HTTP/1.1 | Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/100.0.3478.83 Safari/537.36
ipset add banlist 38.188.60.0/24
</code></pre>

<p>So the three requests from this network came from just two different IP numbers:</p>

<ul>
<li>38.188.60.92</li>
<li>38.188.60.70</li>
</ul>

<p>The first suspicious request is for a list of recent changes made in the last 3 days for the page &ldquo;Comments on VimMode&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s check whether this is a false positive. Perhaps the request belongs into a sequence that makes sense to a human?</p>

<pre><code>$ grep 38.188.60.92 /var/log/apache2/access.log /var/log/apache2/access.log.1 
/var/log/apache2/access.log:www.emacswiki.org:443 38.188.60.92 - - [24/Jan/2025:11:57:58 +0100] &quot;GET /emacs?action=rc&amp;all=1&amp;days=3&amp;rcidonly=Comments_on_VimMode&amp;showedit=0 HTTP/1.1&quot; 503 3868 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/88.0.4324.150 Safari/537.36&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>This strange request is the only request this IP number made in over 24h.</p>

<p>The only explanation I have is that the URL belongs to a dataset used to train AI, using bots running from machines rented all around the world.
Or it&rsquo;s a denial of service attack.</p>

<p><strong>2025-01-25</strong>. I think I finally understand the packages about making it all persistent:</p>

<p><code>netfilter-persistent</code> calls all the modules.</p>

<p><code>iptables-persistent</code> is the module that saves <code>/etc/iptables/rules.v4</code> and <code>/etc/iptables/rules.v6</code> with just the rules.</p>

<p><code>ipset-persistent</code> is the module that saves <code>/etc/iptables/ipsets</code>.
This file is about 1MB and pretty much contains what <code>ban-cidr</code> contains.</p>

<p>And as it turns out, saving is never automatic.</p>

<p>You need to run <code>netfilter-persistent save</code> manually after running <code>ban-cidr</code> for all the rules and sets to be loaded on a reboot.</p>

<p>Similar stories in the news:</p>

At times, the AI bots would clog the lines with hundreds of IP addresses simultaneously as soon as they decided to access the site&rsquo;s content. &ndash; <a href="https://www.heise.de/en/news/AI-bots-paralyze-Linux-news-site-and-others-10252162.html">AI bots paralyze Linux news site and others</a></p>

<p>The article by  Ashley Belanger for Ars Technica mentions <a class="account" href="https://tldr.nettime.org/@tante" title="@tante@tldr.nettime.org">@tante</a> and <a class="account" href="https://come-from.mad-scientist.club/@algernon" title="@algernon@come-from.mad-scientist.club">@algernon</a>, gibberish-serving (and AI-poisoning?) <a href="https://zadzmo.org/code/nepenthes/">Nepenthes</a>, calling it malware.

<p>I like this guy.</p>

<p>If you want to read the original answers by @tante, see his blog post, <a href="https://tante.cc/2025/01/28/quoted-in-ars-technicas-article-on-tarpits-for-ai-crawlers/">Quoted in Ars Technica’s article on tarpits for AI crawlers</a>.</p>

<p>All I&rsquo;ll say is that I fear something like Nepenthes will just tie up too many resources of mine (RAM, file handles, bandwidth). &ldquo;CO₂ for the CO₂ god!&rdquo; But perhaps I&rsquo;m wrong? I should investigate.</p>

<p>Although <a class="account" href="https://octodon.social/@wim_v12e" title="@wim_v12e@octodon.social">@wim_v12e</a> commented, saying:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no way that something like Nephentes would ever be deployed at a scale so large that it would create considerable additional emissions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For now, I keep returning a 410 &ldquo;Gone&rdquo; response to self-identified bots and I just drop packets from networks that have hosted bots at the firewall. There are probably problems with this system as packets from fediverse instances hosted by the same providers get cut off, too. And I&rsquo;m not expiring the bans, unfortunately.</p>

## 2025-01-30 Gender and language

date: 2025-01-30, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-01-30-gender-and-language">2025-01-30 Gender and language</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m always positively surprised when I see the <a href="https://www.bk.admin.ch/bk/de/home/dokumentation/sprachen/hilfsmittel-textredaktion/leitfaden-zum-geschlechtergerechten-formulieren.html">guidelines on gender-neutral writing</a> by the Federal Chancellery in Switzerland, with German, French, Italian and Rumantsch being full of those pesky gender thingies.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://mutual.tls.zone/@robbo" title="@robbo@mutual.tls.zone">@robbo</a> then linked me to a book in French about inclusive language. I liked the blurb very much. Like Portuguese, the language has a rule that if a group of people is all women, use female forms, but if there just one man, no matter how many women there are, use male forms. The blurb says how this pushes women out of the public sphere because they are no longer perceived as doing anything. And the blurb says that the speakers of a language have a choice! We can change, and our language can change. It belongs to the speakers who are alive now, not to the dead of the past.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>En 1647, Claude Favre de Vaugelas, l’un des premiers membres de l’Académie française, écrit que « le genre masculin, étant le plus noble, doit prédominer toutes les fois que le masculin et le féminin se trouvent ensemble ». Une opinion partagée par d’innombrables penseurs des XVIIe et XVIIIe siècle qui envoie balancer la croyance populaire selon laquelle le masculin l’emporte sur le féminin parce qu’il est générique, neutre ou universel. Le féminin grammatical, ainsi que les formes féminines des noms de métiers, ont été sciemment éclipsées pour pousser les femmes hors de la sphère publique, pour les empêcher de se nommer, peut-être même de se penser. … Mais les francophones n’ont pas dit leur dernier mot! Les multiples stratégies d’écriture inclusive déjà répandues témoignent de la révolution langagière que nous connaissons et qui défonce les barrières artificielles érigées par les académiciens. … Cet ouvrage sert d’introduction à l’écriture inclusive, de traité d’histoire sur l’influence du sexisme sur la langue, mais surtout de formidable outil pour quiconque cherche à écrire en ne laissant personne dans l’ombre. &ndash; <a href="https://editionssommetoute.com/livre/grammaire-pour-un-francais-inclusif/">Grammaire pour un français inclusif</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a bit related to discussions around the other languages I speak: Is German German more German than Swiss or Austrian German? Is Continental Portuguese more Portuguese than Brazilian Portuguese? Is English English more English than Indian English or Irish English? No! The language belongs to those who speak it.</p>

Good oligarchs and bad oligarchs. We need to help the good ones have the guts to get on the air, with really good creative advertising, telling the people exactly what's being done to them now, without pulling any punches. They have to be warned and they aren't. You have to be paying a lot of attention to understand. And it's hard to know what to believe. We have to have a voice in this, now.

## I Was a Teenage Exocolonist

It&rsquo;s set in, like, a socialist colony on an alien planet, with lots of gender &amp; sexual diversity and even polyamorous representation (hell yes!). But also, it&rsquo;s a time loop game – you&rsquo;re supposed to play through it more than once, using the knowledge your character gains each run to make better choices the next time around. I finished my first run today (which took me 11.4 hours over four days&hellip; hooked, I have been) and I&rsquo;m really excited to play the next one. It also has a beautiful art style and great soundtrack!</p>
<p>The only thing is, while I was trying to avoid spoilers (which I usually never do! Usually I&rsquo;m like &ldquo;gimme that walkthrough&rdquo; but with this one I wanted to experience it first) I did read a lot of reviews that were like, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re basically doomed to a bad ending on your first run,&rdquo; but I became&hellip; a teacher. And because I had a rebellion score of 100/100, I became the best kind of teacher who teaches the kids to &ldquo;question everything&rdquo;. I mean, there had been a lot of tragic deaths in the first half of my run, but the ending itself didn&rsquo;t really seem bad. Maybe what people meant is that the ending didn&rsquo;t magically undo the tragic deaths, idk. I did see one review which was like, &ldquo;this game is the worst, it didn&rsquo;t warn me I needed at least one skill at 100/100 by the end of the game&rdquo; but I had like&hellip; five skills at 100/100; this was not a high bar to clear. I have <em>now</em> looked up the list of possible endings and honestly, I don&rsquo;t even know what you get if you didn&rsquo;t have any skills at 100&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and then the <em>other</em> thing was that the character I&rsquo;d been trying to romance fuckin&rsquo; <span class="spoiler">planted a bomb and peaced out for the last year or something of the game. Disappeared, never to be seen again</span>. So I guess I have an idea for what I want to focus on next time.</p>

There's a great moment in Woody Allen's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeper_(1973_film)">Sleeper</a> where a time traveler was told that the world was destroyed when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2fYguIX17Q&t=130s">Albert Shanker</a> got hold of a nuclear warhead. If you lived in NYC in the 70s and 80s you knew <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Shanker">Albert Shanker</a> as a NY character like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Sharpton">Al Sharpton</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Sliwa">Curtis Sliwa</a>.  New York <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Hernandez">had</a> its own semi-celebrities, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani">people</a> who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Morrow">were</a> famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Breslin">mostly</a> in New York, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bella_Abzug">but</a> not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Koch">as</a> much <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lindsay">outside</a>. So Albert Shanker with a nuclear weapon kind of fit his character as a bomb throwing type in city politics in an extreme way. A fitting and comic way for us to end it all. Proof that god has a sense of humor. It was an inside reference only NYers would get. Well in case you didn't know it, back in that time or a little later, Trump was one of those Albert Shanker types. And yes, now again he has all the nuclear weapons. And it still feels like he's only famous in a mediocre Queens real estate way. Isn't that weird?

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-01-29, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

We're programmed to believe big companies make things the right way and individual people can't be trusted. We're going to have to break out of that rut, to stop trusting them so much. It's like the 2008 banking crisis, but this time they've taken over the government, not just the economy. The tech industry, believe it or not, started with assumption that it was the other way around. That people were the brilliance, and companies started wars to make money (we were the generation that stopped the Vietnam war, btw). I got into computers because I thought I could earn a living that way, but quickly discovered how inherently subversive they are. They weren't just for the nerds with the plastic pocket protectors, they were also for hippies. Some of us are still here and we want to create with you.

## ExxonMobil Lobbyist Caught Hacking Climate Activists

The firm, in turn, was allegedly working on behalf of one of the world&#8217;s largest oil and gas companies, based in Texas, that wanted to discredit groups and individuals involved in climate litigation, according to the lawyer for the U.S. government. In court documents, the Justice Department does not name either company...</p></blockquote>

## 2025-01-29 Tangara

<h1 id="2025-01-29-tangara">2025-01-29 Tangara</h1>

<p>I joined the kickstarter a long time ago and got the device yesterday. The package was nice. It works. The menu looks good – always tricky with a wheel user interface. My 16GiB SD card works, all I had to so was reformat it using a VFAT file-system (whatever the Gnome Disks app suggested). The device came semi-charged so it worked immediately. Something rattles when I shake it. Maybe it’s the button? There is some sort of haptic feedback with the UI which surprised me. The UI doesn’t dim or go dark with inactivity, there’s a switch to do it. I guess I like it. The music sounds great with my old Sennheiser Monument cable-only headphones.</p>

## ★ My Spitball Theory on TikTok’s Current Semi-Reprieve in the U.S.

Even if the build of TikTok already installed on an American user’s phone continues to function, that user can’t reinstall TikTok (or any of ByteDance’s other apps) on a new or restored phone until those apps are back in the app stores.

Wait till one of them commits a major crime and run <a href="https://www.c-span.org/clip/vignette/willy-horton-attack-ad/4495693">Willie Horton</a> style ads.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-01-28, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I thought this excerpt from <a href="https://contrarian.substack.com/p/departing-the-new-york-times">Krugman's piece</a> about his move back to blogging was right on. "For a while I tried to make up for the loss of the blog with threads on Twitter. But even before Elon Musk Nazified the site, tweet threads were an awkward, inferior substitute for blog posts." There's a need for a system that combines the full-featured writing of blogging and the timelines of twitter-like systems.

Yesterday slipped away, and I never got a chance to mark the 15th birthday of the iPad, perhaps one of the most misunderstood products in Apple’s lineup.

## 15 Minutes

date: 2025-01-28, from: Dave Rupert blog

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sMZdQaKcqs4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>This might be my favorite song of all time. It’s by a slightly obscure Chicago punk band called The Broadways, made up of a couple members from the more well-known ska band Slapstick. It’s got everything you want in a punk song. Palm mutes, open meedly-meedly parts, yelling, speed, a half-time breakdown, and impeccable synchronicity. I listen to this song when I’m sad, when I’m frustrated, when I’m in traffic, and when I need to inject high octane fuel into my veins. The soaring octave chords will always pick me back up again.</p>
<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="markdown">All on the streets, the signs read
Cheaper and better technology
This capitalist vision is my nightmare

Put up a sign in my face
What the fuck happened to this place?
I think we made a wrong turn
Look at the lovely concrete

I drove to my stupid job today
Got stopped at an intersection
Fifteen minutes of my life just rolled away

Looked at the guy next to me
He didn't look too happy
No one's happy, but everyone's too busy to see

Let's go shopping today
Drive our fancy cars to the fancy malls
And for lunch we'll have Big Macs

I wish I could turn the clock back
Back to when I was ten
When I wasn't scared of everything
And everything wasn't so fucking crowded

And I wonder if my kid will ever see the horizon
Untouched by billboards and shopping malls
And I wonder if this crazy world
Thinks I'm the one that's crazy

What if I'm the one who's crazy?
What if I'm the one who's crazy?
What if I'm the one who's crazy?
What if I'm the one who's crazy?
I'm not crazy, just frustrated
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>WIthout a doubt, this song from my teenage years subliminally shaped a lot of my views on what’s wrong with the world. Capitalist intrusions. Eyeball monetization. The always upgrade tech cycle. Why I hate crowds. And traffic. Life evaporating at a stop light seems like a criminal waste of humanity to me. This may subconsciously be part of why I work from home.</p>
<p>I’ll never live up to my punk rock ideals or my teenage self, but this song takes me back to them. Not to “when I was ten”, but to “when I was seventeen” for sure. Driving through big city Houston at night. Going to Food Not Bombs near the abandoned hospital. All it takes is the first verse and BOOM! I’m transported through time and I can see the world through my old anarcho-tinted glasses. It makes you want to smash systems and break concrete.</p>

## Is Bluesky billionaire-proof?

date: 2025-01-28, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Could what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk">happened</a> to Twitter, happen there?</p>
<p>To determine, ask yourself if you could continue to use it if it was acquired by a billionaire for their own personal political use?</p>
<p>What would you switch to?</p>
<p>Would you have to give up your history and followers?</p>
<p>And developers, what would you do if the billionaire acquirer dropped support for the api? How expensive and time consuming would it be to convert to a different protocol? Would you even bother?</p>
<p>We’ve learned a lot from the billionaire acquisition of twitter. The answer to these questions made a lot of us think we’d never want to do this again. But despite all the misleading hype, we very much are repeating the mistakes.</p>
<p>The current owners of Bluesky would be crazy if they closed off the opportunity to get rich. But they shouldn’t be misleading users and developers into believing that it’s safe to trust this as an open platform that couldn’t be acquired and have its utility consumed the way twitter's was.</p>
<p>This started as a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oety7qbfx7x6exn2ytrwikmr/post/3lgsgmmhyf22q">thread</a> on Bluesky of course. :-)</p>
<p>PS: Spoiler -- Bluesky is, as it is currently configured, not billionaire-proof. It's going to get acquired, it probably already has, based on what they're doing. Remember, pay attention to what they do, not what they say. It's just as true in tech as it is in politics, and these days, what's the difference anyway? </p>
<p>PPS: If you're thinking ahh but there's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol">AT Protocol</a>, our ace in the hole. Please. Twitter had an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter#Technology">API</a> too. It didn't make a difference. And AT Proto won't either unless there are proven systems that people are actually using that peer with Bluesky's servers, so those users can't be sold to the billionaire. We're nowhere near that. No one can say with any certainty that it's even possible. At this point the continued support of the API is entirely up to the owners of Bluesky. They could change it, break developers or completely drop it and the users and developers would have no recourse. </p>
<p>PPPS: Can you imagine the founders of Bluesky wouldn't take $20 million each for their share? </p>

## CISA Under Trump

<p>Jen Easterly is out as the Director of CISA. Read her final <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/big-interview-jen-easterly-cisa-cybersecurity/">interview</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s a lot of unfinished business. We have made an impact through our ransomware vulnerability warning pilot and our pre-ransomware notification initiative, and I&#8217;m really proud of that, because we work on preventing somebody from having their worst day. But ransomware is still a problem. We have been laser-focused on PRC cyber actors. That will continue to be a huge problem. I&#8217;m really proud of where we are, but there&#8217;s much, much more work to be done. There are things that I think we can continue driving, that the next administration, I hope, will look at, because, frankly, cybersecurity is a national security issue...</p></blockquote>

## Rivers on Bluesky

date: 2025-01-27, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>This is a post for longtime Scripting News readers. As you know, I've been doing feed readers for a long time. They've been mostly organized around the <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22river%20of%20news%22">river of news</a> concept, which also happens to be the way twitter-like systems work. My rivers are built around <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> and formats that interop with RSS. </p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/19/basketball.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Then I got one of the ideas out of the blue that at first didn't make sense, but then the more I thought about the better the idea seemed. It came from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mcuban.bsky.social">Mark Cuban</a>, who liked one of my posts on Bluesky, it was about some FeedLand rivers I had produced, and then I did what I often do -- I offered to do something like that for him. For obvious reasons I don't need to go into here, you all are smart or you wouldn't be reading this. :-)</p>
<p>Anyway -- he said "I'd use that if it were on Bluesky." </p>
<p>My first thought, ridiculous -- can't be done. They have all these limits that aren't present in HTML. I don't have any idea how I could make this work. Here's a <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/01/27/riverInFeedlandScreenshot.png">screen shot</a> of what a river looks like in FeedLand. </p>
<p>But then after a few hours or days, the idea developed, as often happens, and I decided it might work and was worth a try. </p>
<p>So I wrote a piece of software that hooked into FeedLand's outbound news flow, and picked out stories from the right feeds, and shot them over to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/feediverse.bsky.social">an account on Bluesky</a>. Thanks to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mcuban.bsky.social">Cuban</a>, who linked to it from his million+ follower account, it has 7.6K followers. It uses the list of feeds in my <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=blogroll">blogroll</a> on Scripting News to feed the river. I think it's a really good pioneering effort, with quite a few followers who are active. And it's going to stay running for the indefinite future. That was in December. </p>
<p>Now I've gone a step further, and generalized the code so I can have N of these rivers instead of just one. And to prove it works, I now have two new rivers on Bluesky. </p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dave.feediverse.org">dave.feediverse.org</a> -- the <a href="https://news.scripting.com/?tab=dave">Dave tab</a> on my news site. It subscribes to all the RSS feeds I generate. My linkblog, Scripting News, even my YouTube channel which has an RSS feed. Chuck Shotton requested this. It was a good idea so it was the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dave.feediverse.org">first new river</a> I did on Bluesky. Went on the air just yesterday and now has 10 followers. </li>
<li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nba.feediverse.org">nba.feediverse.org</a> -- then my project for this morning is to do the same thing for the NBA. I'm a huge Knicks fan, and basically love all of the NBA. People say the Knicks must win a championship, but I say who cares. If they keep playing at this level, with new castmembers all the time, with the track record of current management, I'm a totally happy campter. If we won a championship all the more exciting, but after all those years in the wilderness, it's so nice to finally after all this time to have a great NBA team in NY (and sorry the Nets don't count). Anyway, there's nothing more really to say. If you like basketball, and use Bluesky -- <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nba.feediverse.org">here's</a> what you follow. </li>
</ol>
<p>One more thing -- no federation here folks. It's very simple. No new formats or protocols, built entirely on the tried-and-true RSS and OPML formats for feeds and subscription lists. (And of course support for Atom and RDF too.)</p>
<p>I'm glad Mark Cuban asked me to try this path, it provides something I hadn't thought of. Not just inbound feeds for Bluesky, inbound rivers. All we need now is Markdown support, and then a <a href="https://textcasting.org/">few more things</a>, and we'll be back to where we were in 1997. :-)</p>

## What is a sanctuary city?

date: 2025-01-27, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I wonder if people understand what a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary_city">sanctuary city</a> is. </p>
<ul>
<li>In a sanctuary city the local government accepts the fact that there are people living in the city who are not there legally. </li>
<li>They want these people to be able to call the police without fear of being turned into the feds. Otherwise crime would go unreported and that would create much larger problems. </li>
<li>They want the children of these people, who are often American citizens, to be able to go to school, again without having the parents reported to the feds. If they didn't guarantee that, the kids wouldn't be in school, and we all lose by having uneducated adults. It's a core principle of this country that educated citizens are a good thing.</li>
<li>They want them to be able to get health care, to go to a hospital when someone is seriously ill or injured. This is partly for pragmatic reasons, to slow disease spreading, and also because we are a rich country and keeping people healthy is a good thing, just like education. What other purpose could a government have? (A fair question for Republicans, one they probably wouldn't want to answer truthfully.) </li>
</ul>
<p>The Republican talking points make it sound like local governments that declare as sanctuary cities are weak or immoral or anti-American, but that is not what's going on. You couldn't run a city with huge crimes commited against illegals because they would be so vulnerable, and kids need education, and everyone needs health care. Yet I hear the word used all the time in public discourse, and am concerned that most people don't know what it means. </p>

## New VPN Backdoor

date: 2025-01-27, updated: 2025-01-25, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>A newly discovered <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/backdoor-infecting-vpns-used-magic-packets-for-stealth-and-security/">VPN backdoor</a> uses some interesting tactics to avoid detection:</p>
<blockquote><p>When threat actors use backdoor malware to gain access to a network, they want to make sure all their hard work can&#8217;t be leveraged by competing groups or detected by defenders. One countermeasure is to equip the backdoor with a passive agent that remains dormant until it receives what&#8217;s known in the business as a &#8220;magic packet.&#8221; On Thursday, researchers revealed that a never-before-seen backdoor that quietly took hold of dozens of enterprise VPNs running Juniper Network&#8217;s Junos OS has been doing just that...</p></blockquote>

## A story about pans

date: 2025-01-26, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>The other day I sent my wife a link to <a href="https://madeincookware.com/products/ceramic-frying-pan/set">a new set of ceramic pans</a> and asked, “What do you think?” assuming she’d be as impressed as I was of the picture of eggs sliding off the pan. Her response: a grimace. Using my sixteen years of husbandly intuition, I surmised that we were not on the same page about kitchenware.</p>
<p>For context, my wife has had the same stainless steel pans that her parents bought her since we met. They’ve outlasted the fancier non-stick pans we’ve auditioned. Her opinion of the pans is that they’re high-quality because they’ve lasted so long and still work. And from that perspective she’s right, they technically still work… but not without some downsides.</p>
<p>When you use stainless steel pans instead of non-stick pans, you’re committing to stickiness and having a harder time cleaning your pans. I can accept that as an incurred cost. I think my bigger issue is that ALL our pans do this. Even our cast irons which we’ve made thousands of batches of bacon with but still aren’t seasoned. If you make scrambled eggs, about two eggs worth of material forms a brown sheet of crust on the bottom of the pan that I must scrape off but NOT using soap per the laws of properly seasoning a cast iron pan.</p>
<p>Anyways, my wife and I aren’t seeing eye-to-eye on the pans and I’m kind of struggling to see why. I think there’s some frugalness afoot and possibly some sentimental attachment to items that were gifts. And then she –with her Deanna Troi, betazoid-levels of empathy– said “You probably think we need new ones because you do the dishes” and that was our ah-ha moment!</p>
<p>In our house I’m the self-appointed dish-master because I can hyperfocus on them while listening to an audiobook, pairing something I don’t like with something I do like. My perspective on the pans is that they’re a lot of work to clean up every night. Scraping and scrubbing the charred chunky bits off so we can ruin them the next day. Essentially, I operate at a different end of the “stack” of dishes than she does so we see the situation differently. I have bigger feelings about the stickiness of the pans because that’s the part that I interface with the most. I would like to apply non-stick technology to improve the dish-washing process. Where she sees something that works okay and we’ve had for a long time, while I see a maintenance burden.</p>
<p>Now we have an end-to-end/cross-team perspective of our pans and that is valuable. We understand each other’s needs on a micro-level (the pans are too sticky) and the macro-level (one side of the stack inherits more burden with our pan choice) and that’s helpful for framing future conversations about pans. That said, I don’t think we’re getting new pans any time soon. Such is life. Not all decisions are technical ones.</p>

## 2025-01-25 Why Blog?

date: 2025-01-25, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-01-25-why-blog">2025-01-25 Why Blog?</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been asking myself this every now and then.
I&rsquo;m not a party person and while I&rsquo;ve learned to do small talk, I don&rsquo;t talk as much as I write, I think.
Recently, <a class="account" href="https://social.lol/@adam" title="@adam@social.lol">@adam</a> blogged about the <a href="https://notes.neatnik.net/2025/01/blog-question-challenge-2025">Blog Question Challenge</a>.
It reminded me of similar posts of mine.
<a href="2024-03-07-why-blog">2024-03-07 Why do we even blog?</a>.
<a href="2010-08-05_Why_Blog">2010-08-05 Why Blog</a>.
I keep wondering.</p>

<p>The Blog Question Challenge asks the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why did you start blogging in the first place?</li>
<li>What platform are you using to manage your blog, and why do you use it?</li>
<li>Have you blogged on other platforms before?</li>
<li>What’s your favourite post on your blog?</li>
<li>Any future plans for the blog?</li>
</ul>

<p>I think my blogging started with a wiki page on Meatball Wiki.
As far as I remember, wikis preceded blogs.
Sure, people had web logs where they logged the pages they visited.
But that wasn&rsquo;t the kind of longer journaling that came to be associated with blogs.
And frankly, that kind of journaling also didn&rsquo;t happen on that wiki name page.
But from there, it grew. Edits grew longer.
The topics started drifting. And that&rsquo;s when I knew I needed my own wiki.</p>

<p>The wiki was centred around Recent Changes, of course.
That&rsquo;s where new pages were to be found.
It still wasn&rsquo;t a blog and I remember disliking blogs, thinking them to be mediocre solutions for writing.
The wiki link pattern of using camel-case was supposed to encourage accidental linking, to invite contributions by indicating that particular pages did not yet exist.
But writing on my own, these supposed benefits didn&rsquo;t really materialize.
On the contrary, the camel-case links didn&rsquo;t look good.
The camel-case titles didn&rsquo;t look good.
I switched to &ldquo;free&rdquo; links.</p>

<p>Another problem was the amount of pages. My opinions changed.
Was I supposed to delete the old opinions? That hurt.
Move them elsewhere? Not great, either.
Use different names and indicate somehow whether the page was old or not?
I couldn&rsquo;t figure it out and eventually I settled on the current format where the date is part of the page title.
It solved all my problems.</p>

<p>At the same time, other people started blogging and feeds took off.
I wanted a feed for my wiki. But a feed wasn&rsquo;t like Recent Changes.
Recent Changes meant that pages kept reappearing when they were edited.
For many years I used the distinction between &ldquo;minor&rdquo; and &ldquo;major&rdquo; edits for my blog.
Only &ldquo;major&rdquo; edits showed up on the feed and I made sure that only the first edit was marked &ldquo;major&rdquo;.
But it was a hack and I knew it.</p>

<p>All of this led me to switch from Oddmuse to Oddµ.
<a href="Oddmuse">Oddmuse</a> was a traditional wiki, based on UseModWiki, based on even older wikis.
<a href="Odd%C2%B5">Oddµ</a> is the software I currently use.
It does away with version history and usernames and implicitly expects that only very small teams use it.
Or a team of one, in my case.</p>

<p>As for my favourite post on the site? It&rsquo;s hard to say.
Right now, I&rsquo;d say it is <a href="2018-01-30_To_The_Young_Ones">To The Young Ones</a> from 2018.
I also like my <a href="priorities">Priorities</a> post.</p>

<p>As for the future, I don&rsquo;t know either.
I&rsquo;d like to keep blogging.
I&rsquo;d like to blog less about system administration.
I know it&rsquo;s weird but I actually don&rsquo;t like writing about it all that much.
I do it because it is useful.
I use the blog as an external brain, as a memory extender or memex.
Unfortunately, system administration requires a lot of memory extension where as the good blog posts require inspiration, vulnerability, flow.
It&rsquo;s hard to get right.</p>

## The Weekend (Is Here) Reader

date: 2025-01-25, from: Om Malik blog

It has been one of those weeks where so much is going on that the noise is drowning out the signals. When the head of a trillion-dollar software giant starts throwing out lines like a late-night talk show host, you know we’ve finally put the “silly” in Silicon Valley. Not surprisingly, the week has been &#8230;

begun, the attention wars have. 

yes, we need to bring down the platforms with every tool we have: dollars and votes, critique though traditional media, open protocols and policy change

but NB: subverting algorithms in this way is modern grassroots activism that can be massively consequential

## 2025-01-12 Disk space

date: 2025-01-25, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-01-12-disk-space">2025-01-12 Disk space</h1>

<p>It&rsquo;s that time of the year again. How to get back disk space?</p>

<p>Open the Files application and empty the trash. (How to do this from the command line?)</p>

<p>Delete the cache for Debian packages:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get clean
</code></pre>

<p>Check out local caches:</p>

<pre><code>ncdu .cache/
</code></pre>

<p>Python stuff:</p>

<pre><code>pip cache purge
</code></pre>

<p>Also, feel free to delete other stuff in there. I just deleted a &ldquo;whisper&rdquo; directory containing a language model I didn&rsquo;t need and a &ldquo;tracker3&rdquo; directory containing data for the Gnome miner, I think. Also &ldquo;chromium&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s not my main browser. I don&rsquo;t care about its cache.</p>

<p>Perlbrew stuff. Find out what Perls you have installed.</p>

<pre><code>perlbrew list
</code></pre>

<p>You aren&rsquo;t going to need them:</p>

<pre><code>perlbrew uninstall perl-5.30.0
perlbrew uninstall perl-5.32.0
</code></pre>

<p>Also delete old build directories.
You can probably delete all the build directories and the build logs.</p>

<pre><code>ls $HOME/perl5/perlbrew/ $HOME/perl5/perlbrew/build
</code></pre>

<p>Go build cache:</p>

<pre><code>go clean -cache
</code></pre>

## Hegseth

<p>Hegseth's job is to stay out of the way while the Heritage Foundation separates the military into those who take loyalty seriously and those who are retiring.</p>
<p>For that job being an alcoholic is a plus. 😀</p>
<p>They're interviewing for who wants to be his replacement. </p>
<p>His job is to keep the seat warm.</p>

Our best hope is that the factions within MAGA fight each other. We're assuming they have a way to keep everyone in line, but the more power they capture, the harder that's going to be.

An observation -- it's made my <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com">Bluesky account</a> virtually unusable. Anything else I publish there is swamped by the viral post. I'm also working on a new version of the software that turns Bluesky into a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:fkwl6tbnev3vdx63bippmscy">feed reader</a>. It will be able to manage multiple rivers, where the first version could only do one. The next reader will be all the posts from me on all the various services I post to that have outbound RSS feeds. After that, I have ideas for special feeds for specific publications. I want to help our friends in the blogging and news world, using the best communication tools available. I find now that people are much more open to ideas. This is good. But we should never be complacent. Learn from the competition. They were getting ready for this moment, we weren't.

## What Works After a Disaster Happens?

date: 2025-01-25, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

When Hurricane Helene hit Western North Carolina, the Swannanoa River rose three storys above its shores, all but erasing the town named after the river, and leaving hundreds homeless. But the challenge for Swannanoa was not just recovery. It was regeneration. For that, Swannanoa&#8217;s residents formed new kinds of partnerships and problem solutions that could [&#8230;]

## Raycast Focus works really well

date: 2025-01-25, from: Dave Rupert blog

<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/raycastfocus.png" alt="My focus session called actually get some work done with gaming and social media blocked" width="1000" height="632"/>
<p>This week Raycast released a new feature called <a href="https://www.raycast.com/core-features/focus">Raycast Focus</a>. This hyped up the Raycast superfans in my social sphere, so I tried it out and I must say that I’m impressed.</p>
<p>The timing couldn’t have been more perfect. Earlier this week I tried out a handful of browser extensions that would add some friction to social media sites. I have a bit of a bad habit where I open a new tab and instinctively type my favorite social sites: <code>elk.zone</code>, <code>bsky.app</code>, and of course <code>youtube.com</code>. These are mega time-wasters for me. As someone with ADHD these sites are basically dopamine tar pits for my attention.</p>
<p>Videos are an obvious stumbling block, but my biggest pain point is clicking on articles and filling up a couple browsers worth of tabs such that it occupies my brain RAM and I can’t focus on my next task until I clear out my tabs. Even with medication, when the attention ship turns, it can be difficult to steer it back on track. Self-control is great, but the easiest way to avoid distraction is to cut the dopamine off at the source; turn the faucet off at the wall and put child locks on the cabinet. You can still turn it back on, but adding friction to the process makes it a more intentional act of defiance.</p>
<p>Raycast Focus adds the right amount of friction. When you enter a session you can choose what types of apps and websites you want to restrict. If you try to open a tab you’ll get a friendly roadblock. You can still enter the site if necessary but you have to click and hold a button for 3 seconds which is enough time for your brain to reassess if this visit is necessary.</p>
<p>Another positive of Raycast Focus is that it’s an OS level tool. I don’t need different tools to limit apps and websites, it’s all under one roof. I already have muscle memory using Raycast to launch apps so it’s easy to add Raycast Focus to my workflow. And there’s something nice about my distraction launcher also being my distraction governor.</p>
<p>Your mileage may vary, but Raycast Focus is working well for me (almost too well). I feel more productive and sometimes you need to feel productive for your own sake, <em>not your employer’s</em>. Whether it’s your process, your tooling, your calendar, or your own brain working against you, it’s worth finding new strategies to improve your workdays. I’m even using it right now to focus on finishing this blog post and… uh… it worked!</p>
