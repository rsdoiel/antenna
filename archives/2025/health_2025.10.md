## Urinary microbiota changes among NMIBC patients during BCG therapy: comparing BCG responders and non-responders

date: 2025-03-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

The gold standard for treating high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer involves the transurethral removal of cancerous tissue followed by BCG immunotherapy. So far, there is no reliable biomarker for predicting BCG efficacy and identifying patients who will or will not respond to BCG treatment. Emerging evidence suggests that urinary microbiota may play a crucial role in BCG efficacy. This study aimed to explore (i) changes in urinary microbiota during the six induction cycles of BCG and (ii) its potential predictive role in determining the outcome of BCG treatment. To this end, catheterized urine samples were collected before each of the six BCG doses and bacterial composition was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Patient inclusion criteria were male gender, no previous history of urothelial cancer, no other malignancies, no active infection, and no antibiotic usage for at least 20 days before the first BCG dose. We observed a significant decrease in biodiversity, measured by the Shannon Index, during the first week of therapy in 10 out of 12 patients (p=0.021). Additionally, differences in microbiota composition before the start of BCG therapy were noted between responders and non-responders to BCG therapy. Non-responders exhibited a 12 times higher abundance of genus Aureispira (p<0.001), and, at the species level, a 27-fold lower abundance of Negativicoccus succinivorans (p<0.001). Throughout the treatment, the abundance of the genus Aureispira decreased, showing an eightfold reduction by the end of therapy among non-responders (p<0.001). Our findings suggest that urinary microbiota plays an active role before and during the course of BCG therapy. However, this is a preliminary study, and further research involving larger patient cohorts is needed.

## Distinct gut microbiome features characterize Fasciola hepatica infection and predict triclabendazole treatment outcomes in Peruvian patients

date: 2025-03-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundFasciola hepatica, a globally distributed helminth, causes fasciolosis, a disease with significant health and economic impacts. Variability in triclabendazole (TCBZ) efficacy and emerging resistance are remaining challenges. Evidence suggests that the gut microbiome influences host-helminth interactions and is associated with anthelmintic effects, but its association with human F. hepatica infection and TCBZ efficacy is not well understood.MethodsIn this study, we investigated the relationship between Fasciola hepatica infection and the gut microbiome through metagenomic shotgun sequencing of 30 infected and 60 age- and sex-matched uninfected individuals from Peru. Additionally, we performed a longitudinal analysis to evaluate microbiome dynamics in relation to TCBZ treatment response.Results and discussionInfection was associated with specific microbial taxonomic and functional features, including higher abundance of Negativibacillus sp900547015, Blautia A sp000285855, and Prevotella sp002299635 species, and enrichment of microbial pathways linked to survival under stress and depletion of pathways for microbial growth. Unexpectedly, we identified that responders to TCBZ treatment (who cleared infection) harbored many microbiome features significantly different relative to non-responders, both before and after treatment. Specifically, the microbiomes of responders had a higher abundance Firmicutes A and Bacteroides species as well as phospholipid synthesis and glucuronidation pathways, while non-responders had higher abundance of Actinobacteria species including several from the Parolsenella and Bifidobacterium genera, and Bifidobacterium shunt and amino acid biosynthesis pathways.ConclusionsOur findings underscore the impact of helminth infection on gut microbiome and suggest a potential role of gut microbiota in modulating TCBZ efficacy, offering novel insights into F. hepatica-microbiome interactions and paving the way for microbiome-informed treatment approaches.

## Gut microbiome is associated with radiotherapy response in lung cancer patients with brain metastases

date: 2025-03-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

PurposeTo investigate the gut microbiome of lung cancer patients with brain metastases undergoing radiotherapy, identify key microorganisms associated with radiotherapy response, and evaluate their potential as biomarkers.Methods and materialsThis study enrolled 55 newly diagnosed lung cancer patients with brain metastases. Fecal samples were collected before radiotherapy and analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing to assess the gut microbiome’s composition and function. Patients were categorized into response (n=28) and non-response (n=27) groups based on treatment efficacy, and α-diversity, β-diversity, and functional pathways were compared between them. Linear Discriminant Analysis Effect Size was used to identify microbial features associated with treatment efficacy. Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the predictive capacity of clinical and microbial factors for treatment outcomes.ResultsNo significant difference in α-diversity was observed between the groups (P > 0.05), but β-diversity differed significantly (P = 0.036). Twelve characteristic microorganisms were identified in the response group, including g_ Oscillibacter and g_ Blautia, and nine in the non-response group, such as f_ Desulfovibrionaceae and g_ Megamonas. Metabolic pathways associated with treatment response included ketone body metabolism and pathways related to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Multivariate analysis identified g_Flavonifractor (odds ratio [OR] = 6.680, P = 0.004), g_Negativibacillus (OR = 3.862, P = 0.014), C-reactive protein (OR = 1.054, P = 0.017), and systemic inflammation response index (OR = 1.367, P = 0.043) as independent predictors of radiotherapy response. The nomogram and microbiome models achieved area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.935 and 0.866, respectively, demonstrating excellent predictive performance. Decision curve analysis further confirmed these models provided significant net benefits across risk thresholds.ConclusionsThe composition and functional characteristics of the gut microbiome in lung cancer patients with brain metastases prior to radiotherapy are associated with therapeutic response and possess potential as predictive biomarkers. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings.
