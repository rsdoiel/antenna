## Biden Signs New Cybersecurity Order

date: 2025-01-20, updated: 2025-01-20, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>President Biden has signed a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2025/01/16/executive-order-on-strengthening-and-promoting-innovation-in-the-nations-cybersecurity/">new cybersecurity order</a>. It has a bunch of provisions, most notably using the US governments procurement power to improve cybersecurity practices industry-wide.</p>
<p>Some <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/biden-executive-order-cybersecurity-ai-and-more/">details</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The core of the executive order is an array of mandates for protecting government networks based on lessons learned from recent major incidents­&#8212;namely, the security failures of federal contractors.</p>
<p>The order requires software vendors to submit proof that they follow secure development practices, building on <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/M-22-18.pdf">a mandate that debuted</a> in 2022 in response to ...</p></blockquote>

You hear sometimes, now that we know the sordid details of the lives of some of our leading figures, that America has no heroes left.

## American origin stories

date: 2025-01-20, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

&#8220;Origin stories tell us who we think a people are&#8211;who we think we are, and why. The American origin story is written in Native genocide, transatlantic slavery, and imperial subjugation overseas. That is its originating fact, and so to write the next chapter of that story means contending with this prologue, which most Americans find [&#8230;]

## An Open Letter to Democratic Candidates and Organizations

date: 2025-01-19, updated: 2025-01-20, from: Ron Garret

The ink is barely dry on the (drama-free) certification of the election results and I'm already getting calls from organizations and candidates seeking donations.&nbsp; (Apparently my name is on a lot of lists.)&nbsp; In order to save everyone a lot of time, I thought I'd write up my current thinking so I don't have to have the same conversation dozens of times.First and foremost: I really do

Apple and Google, seemingly, are following the law, not Trump’s good-as-gold word and pinkie-swear promise that they won’t be held liable for violating it. But Oracle and Akamai seemingly are going with Trump’s word.

<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/445621-when-you-re-a-carpenter-making-a-beautiful-chest-of-drawers">Steve Jobs</a>: “When you’re a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you’re not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it. You’ll know it’s there, so you’re going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back. For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through.”

## The Blame Game

date: 2025-01-19, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

Twenty-third in the News Commons series Disaster coverage tends to go through four stages: Live reporting. TV stations stop all advertising and go into round-the-clock coverage. Radio stations drop the feeds from elsewhere and go wall-to-wall with live reports. Newspapers drop their paywalls. Coverage by the best of them ranges from good to heroic. As [&#8230;]

When I put an image in the margin of a post I often pause and think about what I want to convey with the image as it relates to the writing that it's next to. In the previous piece the idea was interop. I tried to think of what images I've used in the past, then I thought why don't I just look. I switched into Daytona, entered <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=interop">interop</a>, and found <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/03/12/hamstercage.png">one</a> I loved, but then kept scanning, and found <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/01/runner.png">another</a> that I liked even more. Tools are important. Web writers haven't gotten any new tools in a long time. All the tool development has been for other stuff. Let's make tools for users again, as we did in the olden times. Craftwork in software. Playin in the band!

Here's the deal. You need a place to write a posts and a way to read a timeline of posts. That's the basic functionality. To do that with RSS you would start with a blogging app like WordPress, and a feed reader like FeedLand or NetNewsWire. Manton has integrated the two into a single user interface at <a href="https://micro.blog/">micro.blog</a>. I'm going to approach it in a somewhat differently, not sure yet how it will work, but I'm getting there. And I will offer a way for people to hook in any feed reader they want, thus opening up innovation to tech-curious users. The take-away is that you need to handle inbound and outbound feeds. That's the basics of being twitter-like.

Shortly before midnight last night, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) published its initial findings from a study it undertook last July when it asked eight large companies to turn over information about the data they collect about consumers, product sales, and how the surveillance the companies used affected consumer prices.

## The history and future of corn

Corn tastes better on the honor system by Robin Wall Kimmerer &#8212; with cool paper illustrations by Suus Hessling The writings of some early colonists reveal that they thought corn a primitive crop, because it did not require machines or draft animals to cultivate and process, as did their familiar wheat. They mistook the apparent [&#8230;]
