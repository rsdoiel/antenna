<p>A White House meeting Friday between U.S. President Donald Trump and
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, aimed at securing a deal that
would give the U.S. rights to rare earth minerals in Ukraine, turned
into an intense and heated exchange between the two leaders. The White
House later confirmed that the mineral deal was not signed. White House
Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara has this report.</p>

id="investigation-into-deaths-of-gene-hackman-wife-continues-in-new-mexico">Investigation
into deaths of Gene Hackman, wife continues in New Mexico</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Authorities are continuing their investigation into the circumstances
surrounding the death of Academy Award-winning actor Gene Hackman, 95,
and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, 64, a classical pianist. The couple were
found dead, along with one of their dogs, Wednesday in their home in the
southwestern U.S. state of New Mexico.  </p>
<p>Investigators have retrieved an assortment of prescription and
over-the-counter medications, in addition to cellphones and records from
medical diagnostics testing from the house.  </p>
<p>“I’m pretty confident there is no foul play,” Santa Fe County Sheriff
Adan Mendoza said Friday on The Today Show. He said the autopsy results
“will steer us in the right direction” in determining what happened to
Hackman and his wife.  </p>
<p>Without the autopsy, the sheriff said, it is difficult to determine
how long the couple had been dead.  </p>
<p>A search warrant affidavit issued Thursday said the circumstances
surrounding the couple’s deaths were “suspicious enough in nature to
require a thorough search and investigation.” </p>
<p>Mendoza told The Today Show that several doors around the house were
unlocked and one door in the rear of the house was open. Earlier reports
said the front door was open.   </p>
<p>Hackman’s body was found near the rear of the house, while his wife’s
body was found in a bathroom. The dead dog’s body was found in a dog
crate, not far from Arakawa’s body.  The couple had three German
shepherds. The other two dogs were found alive and healthy at the
property.  </p>
<p>The search warrant affidavit also revealed that police called the
Santa Fe Fire Department and the New Mexico Gas Company to Hackman’s
residence, but no toxic fumes or leaky pipes were found on the
grounds.  </p>
<p>Storied career </p>
<p>Hackman had a lengthy career on stage and screen, including appearing
in Broadway shows, on television and in more than 80 films. </p>
<p>He won an Oscar for best actor for his role in the 1971 film The
French Connection and a best supporting Oscar for the 1992 film
Unforgiven.  </p>
<p>Hackman’s resume featured three other Oscar nominations, including
his breakout role in Bonnie and Clyde in 1967 as well as I Never Sang
for My Father in 1970 and Mississippi Burning in 1988.  </p>
<p>His work crossed genres as he appeared in action movies, thrillers
and off-beat comedies.  </p>
<p>In addition to his award-nominated works, he was also known for roles
in films such as The Poseidon Adventure, Young Frankenstein, Superman,
Hoosiers, The Birdcage, and The Royal Tenenbaums.  </p>
<p>His last film was Welcome to Mooseport in 2004.  </p>
<p>His loss was immediately felt throughout the entertainment community
as fellow artists praised him on social media. Director Francis Ford
Coppola and actor Morgan Freeman were among those who posted their
remembrances of the actor.   </p>
<p>“The loss of a great artist, always cause for both mourning and
celebration,” Coppola posted on Instagram. “Gene Hackman a great actor,
inspiring and magnificent in his work and complexity. I mourn his loss
and celebrate his existence and contribution.” Hackman starred in
Coppola’s 1974 film The Conversation.  </p>
<p>Freeman posted on Instagram: “One of the personal highlights of my
career was bringing the French Film Gardé a Vue (Under Suspicion) to
life with the incredibly gifted Gene Hackman. And of course… Unforgiven.
Rest in peace, my friend.”  </p>

Agence France-Presse and Reuters.</p>

id="trump-to-sign-order-designating-english-as-official-us-language">Trump
to sign order designating English as official US language</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order on
Friday designating English as the official language of the United
States, according to the White House.</p>
<p>The order will allow government agencies and organizations that
receive federal funding to choose whether to continue to offer documents
and services in languages other than English, according to a fact sheet
about the impending order.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear when on Friday that Trump planned to
sign the order.</p>
<p>The executive order will rescind a mandate from former President Bill
Clinton that required the government and organizations that received
federal funding to provide language assistance to non-English
speakers.</p>
<p>Designating English as the national language “promotes unity,
establishes efficiency in government operations and creates a pathway
for civic engagement,” according to the White House.</p>
<p>More than 30 states have already passed laws designating English as
their official language, according to U.S. English, a group that
advocates for making English the official language in the United
States.</p>
<p>For decades, lawmakers in Congress have introduced legislation to
designate English as the official language of the U.S., but those
efforts have not succeeded.</p>
<p>Within hours of Trump’s inauguration last month, the new
administration took down the Spanish language version of the official
White House website.</p>
<p>Hispanic advocacy groups and others expressed confusion and
frustration at the change. The White House said at the time it was
committed to bringing the Spanish language version of the website back
online. As of Friday, it was still not restored.</p>
<p>The White House did not immediately respond to a message about
whether that would happen.</p>
<p>Trump shut down the Spanish version of the website during his first
term. It was restored when President Joe Biden was inaugurated.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal first reported on the order Friday.</p>

White House meeting on mineral deal devolves into heated exchange</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WHITE HOUSE — A White House meeting between President Donald Trump
and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy aimed at securing a deal
that would allow the U.S. access to Ukrainian rare mineral rights turned
into a heated exchange with the two leaders talking over each other and
Trump telling Zelenskyy, “You’re either going to make a deal or we’re
out.”</p>
<p>In a statement on social media after the meeting, Trump indicated the
proposed deal is off.</p>
<p>“I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if
America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big
advantage in negotiations,” Trump wrote.</p>
<p>“He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval
Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.”</p>
<p>The heated exchange, witnessed by dozens of American and Ukrainian
reporters in the Oval Office, took a combative tone about 40 minutes
into the meeting when Zelenskyy raised Russia’s 2014 invasion of
Crimea.</p>
<p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance immediately criticized Zelenskyy,
accusing him of engaging in a “propaganda tour.”</p>
<p>“I think it’s disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office to try
to litigate this in front of the American media,” he told Zelenskyy.</p>
<p>Both Vance and Trump accused the Ukrainian leader of not being
thankful for the assistance his country has received from
Washington.</p>
<p>“You don’t have the cards right now,” Trump said, raising his voice
as Zelenskyy tried to rebut him. “You’re gambling with the lives of
millions of people. You’re gambling with World War III.”</p>
<p>Zelenskyy left the White House early, and a scheduled joint press
conference was canceled.</p>
<p>Later Friday, Trump told reporters before leaving the White House
that the talks “didn’t work out exactly great.”</p>
<p>Trump said that if the U.S. signs the mineral deal, it is his
impression that Zelenskyy is “looking to go on and fight, fight,
fight.”</p>
<p>“We are not looking to go into a 10-year war and play games,” Trump
said.</p>
<p>When asked by a reporter what Zelenskyy needs to do to restart talks,
Trump responded, ‘He’s got to say, ’I want to make peace.’”</p>
<p>Zelenskyy response</p>
<p>Despite the abrupt end to the meeting, the Ukrainian leader took to
social media soon after it ended to address the American public and U.S.
leadership.</p>
<p>“Thank you America,” Zelenskyy posted on the X social media platform.
“Thank you <span class="citation" data-cites="POTUS">@POTUS</span>,
Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace,
and we are working exactly for that.”</p>
<p>Later Friday, Zelenskyy told Fox News that he believes the
relationship between Ukraine and the U.S. can be salvaged and said he
does not want to lose the United States as a partner. He added, however,
he wants Trump to be “more on our side.”</p>
<p>When asked if he should apologize to Trump, Zelenskyy said, “I think
that we have to be very open and very honest, and I’m not sure that we
did something bad.”</p>
<p>Rare minerals deal</p>
<p>Before the meeting devolved, Trump said he was close to signing the
deal with Zelenskyy.</p>
<p>“We have something that is a very fair deal, and we look forward to
getting in and digging, digging, digging, and working and getting some
of the rare earth,” Trump told a visibly uncomfortable Zelenskyy.</p>
<p>The proposed deal included provisions for the co-ownership and
management of a postwar reconstruction fund for Ukraine, to which
Ukraine would allocate 50% of future revenues from the country’s natural
resources.</p>
<p>But a White House spokesperson said the agreement was not signed.</p>
<p>Fallout</p>
<p>House Democratic leader Hakeem Jefferies said in a statement: “For
three years, President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people have stood on
the side of democracy, freedom and truth. Their success is in the
national security interests of the United States. We should stand with
Ukraine until victory is won.”</p>
<p>Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson wrote on Facebook:
“Thanks to President Trump — the days of America being taken advantage
of and disrespected are OVER,” adding what was seen in the Oval Office
was an “American President putting America first.”</p>
<p>The public collapse of talks between Trump and Zelenskyy were met
with cheers from some Russian officials.</p>
<p>“The insolent pig finally got a proper slap down in the Oval Office,”
Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chair of Russia’s National Security Council,
posted on X.</p>
<p>Medvedev added that Trump “is right: The Kiev [sic] regime is
‘gambling with WWIII.’”</p>
<p>Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, defended the Ukrainian
leader.</p>
<p>“The President is fighting for our country, for everyone who stands
for a just and lasting peace,” Yermak posted on X. “Without real
guarantees, war will return.”</p>
<p>Responses from Europe</p>
<p>European officials, including from France, Germany, Finland and the
Netherlands, also took to social media to voice support for Ukraine.</p>
<p>“Ukraine is Europe! We stand by Ukraine,” said European Union High
Representative for Foreign Affairs Kaja Kallas, posting on X.</p>
<p>’We will step up our support to Ukraine so that they can continue to
fight back the aggressor,” Kallas said. “Today, it became clear that the
free world needs a new leader. It’s up to us, Europeans, to take this
challenge.”</p>
<p>First White House meeting</p>
<p>Trump and Zelenskyy have had in-person engagements in the past, but
Friday marks their first one at the White House. Earlier this month, the
pair spoke by phone after Trump’s call with Russian President Vladimir
Putin.</p>
<p>Since coming to office, Trump has increased his pressure campaign on
Ukraine, claiming that Kyiv started the war with Russia and calling
Zelenskyy a “dictator.” Russian forces invaded Ukraine in February
2022.</p>
<p>Trump also has repeated a claim that the U.S. has spent $350 billion
on Ukraine’s war — a figure that far eclipses the amount recorded by the
Department of Defense and the interagency oversight group that tracks
U.S. appropriations to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Trump is pursuing direct negotiations with Russia without
the involvement of Kyiv or European allies. He defended them during his
Thursday press conference as “common sense.”</p>
<p>He described the talks as “very well advanced” but cautioned that
there is only a narrow window to secure a deal to end the war. He
expressed confidence that Putin will “keep his word” and not launch
further aggression on Ukraine should a peace agreement between Moscow
and Kyiv be reached.</p>

arrests at US-Mexico border near record low in February</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The number of migrants caught illegally crossing the
U.S.-Mexico border in February is on pace to be at or near a record
monthly low, a U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson and two
other sources told Reuters.</p>
<p>The U.S. Border Patrol is on pace to have arrested around 8,500
migrants at the border in February as the end of the month nears, DHS
spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said. Two other sources said the monthly
total would be at or near a record low.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump, a Republican, took an array of actions to
deter illegal immigration after returning to the White House on January
20, saying a crackdown was needed after high levels of migration under
his predecessor, former President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Trump’s moves included implementing a sweeping ban on asylum at the
border and surging military troops to assist border security.</p>
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union sued the Trump administration over
the ban earlier this month, arguing it violated U.S. asylum law and
international treaties.</p>
<p>The Trump administration also struck new agreements with Mexico and
Central American countries to accept U.S. deportees from other nations
and has sent some migrants to a camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</p>
<p>U.S. Border Patrol’s monthly enforcement statistics go back to 2000.
The lowest monthly total on record is currently April 2017, when the
agency arrested 11,127 at the start of Trump’s first term.</p>
<p>While the number of border arrests similarly dipped at the start of
Trump’s 2017-21 presidency, they rebounded in the months and years that
followed.</p>
<p>The February projection would be a steep drop from the 141,000
migrant arrests in February 2024 and down from 29,000 in January,
according to U.S. government figures.</p>

id="british-pm-starmer-seeks-to-project-unity-with-trump-despite-differences-on-ukraine">British
PM Starmer seeks to project unity with Trump despite differences on
Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>white house — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he and
President Donald Trump discussed achieving an agreement to end the war
between Ukraine and Russia that would involve Kyiv and be backed by
European peacekeeping forces.</p>
<p>Following meetings Thursday at the White House, Starmer said the plan
would “reach a peace that is tough and fair, that Ukraine will help
shape, that’s backed by strength to stop [Russian President Vladimir]
Putin coming back for more.”</p>
<p>Any agreement cannot lead to a peace “that rewards the aggressor,”
Starmer underscored, mirroring remarks that French President Emmanuel
Macron delivered at his White House meeting with Trump on Monday that
“the aggressor is Russia.”</p>
<p>“We agreed history must be on the side of the peacemaker, not the
invader,” Starmer said, speaking alongside Trump during their joint news
conference.</p>
<p>Starmer vowed to work closely with other European leaders and said
the United Kingdom was ready to deploy peacekeeping troops together with
its allies, “because that is the only way that peace will last.”</p>
<p>Trump, however, was noncommittal on providing any security
guarantees, including on a proposed U.S. “backstop” to support European
peacekeepers to enforce a potential truce — a condition Starmer
required.</p>
<p>“I don’t like to talk about peacekeeping until we have a deal,” Trump
said during the news conference. “I like to get things done. I don’t
want to give it the bad luck sign.”</p>
<p>Trump signaled that the U.S. backstop could be given in the form of
the deal he is trying to secure with Kyiv that would allow American
access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals and recoup funds given by former
President Joe Biden’s administration to support the country’s war
efforts.</p>
<p>“It’s a backstop, you could say. I don’t think anybody’s going to
play around if we’re there with a lot of workers,” the president told
reporters at the Oval Office earlier Thursday.</p>
<p>During the news conference, Trump defended his decision to directly
negotiate with Russia without the involvement of Kyiv or European allies
as “common sense,” saying, “If you want peace, you have to talk to both
sides.”</p>
<p>Trump said that talks with Moscow were “very well advanced” but
cautioned that there was only a narrow window to secure a deal. He
expressed confidence that Putin would “keep his word” and not launch
further aggression on Ukraine should a peace agreement between Moscow
and Kyiv be reached.</p>
<p>“I’ve known him for a long time now,” he said. “We had to go through
the Russian hoax together,” he added, in an apparent reference to the
U.S. government investigation that examined whether Trump’s 2016
presidential campaign illegally coordinated with Russia to sway the
outcome of the U.S. election.</p>
<p>Trump’s outreach to Putin is a drastic reversal of Biden’s policies,
which sought to diplomatically and financially isolate Russia and
insisted on “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine,” regarding peace
negotiations.</p>
<p>Trump was asked whether he would apologize to Ukrainian President
Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom he had called a “dictator.” While not saying
whether he would apologize, Trump said, “I have a lot of respect for him
[Zelenskyy].”</p>
<p>Zelenskyy is set to visit the White House on Friday.</p>
<p>Ukraine peacekeeping</p>
<p>Differences remain among European allies on any future deployment of
peacekeeping troops to Ukraine. The U.K. supports a French-led proposal,
while other nations, including Poland, have ruled it out.</p>
<p>Putin rejects any suggestions of a peacekeeping troop deployment to
Ukraine. He said Thursday that “Western elites” were trying to disrupt
the newly established dialogue between Moscow and Washington.</p>
<p>Pushed to clarify Trump’s position on sending peacekeepers, a senior
administration official speaking on background to reporters Thursday
said there were “concerns” about putting troops on the ground at a
“post-Minsk I level of conflict, even post-Minsk II.”</p>
<p>The official was referring to the 2014 and 2015 agreements aimed at
ending fighting between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists in the
Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, neither of which was sustained.</p>
<p>The official said there would be less concern about sending troops if
the conflict were “dialed down to a functional ceasefire,” as the U.S.
wants. The type of force deployed will depend on the political
settlement to end the war, the official said — a “trade-off” that Trump
and Starmer will focus on.</p>
<p>Starmer needs to reinforce that Europeans must be part of any peace
discussions, said Gesine Weber, a fellow on the German Marshall Fund’s
Geostrategy team.</p>
<p>“It would be very odd to have a situation where you have the burden
shift to Europeans, but not the strategic responsibility and the
strategic reflections,” she told VOA.</p>
<p>Unified front</p>
<p>It was a challenging visit for Starmer as he sought to balance the
U.K.’s interests and those of its European allies while engaging with an
unpredictable U.S. administration.</p>
<p>“The most important thing is: Do these guys get along? Do they have a
common vision?” Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution, said about Trump and Starmer.</p>
<p>That, he told VOA, could signal the emergence of a Western strategy
to end the war with NATO’s support.</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, then we’re in a good position to try to promote
a negotiation between Russia and Ukraine,” O’Hanlon added.</p>
<p>Seeking to project a unified front with Trump, Starmer highlighted
that the two sides would work together on an economic deal focused on
artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>During the joint news conference and earlier in the Oval Office,
Starmer underscored a state visit invitation by King Charles to Trump,
the second such invitation following Trump’s 2019 trip to London, as
“historic” and “unprecedented.”</p>
<p>He dismissed a reporter’s question on whether the king expressed any
concerns about Trump’s plans to annex Canada, a British Commonwealth
country.</p>
<p>“I think you’re trying to find a divide between us that doesn’t
exist,” he said.</p>
<p>Starmer is keen to secure favorable terms amid potential U.S. tariffs
that could impact British exports as the U.S. hits European countries
with 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum.</p>
<p>Trump told reporters that Starmer had “earned whatever they [the
British government] pay him” in working to convince him against
implementing punitive trade measures.</p>
<p>Boosting defense</p>
<p>Trump, who wants NATO members to boost defense spending to 5% of
their gross domestic product, also reiterated his stance that Europe
should “step up.”</p>
<p>In 2023, the U.S. spent 3.4% of its GDP on defense, according to U.S.
government data compiled by the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute.</p>
<p>In what appeared to be a move to satisfy Trump, Starmer announced on
Tuesday an unexpected increase in the U.K. defense budget to 2.5% of the
nation’s GDP by 2027, then to 2.6% the following year.</p>
<p>The increase will be funded by cutting Britain’s already depleted
foreign aid budget to just 0.3% of the country’s GDP. Starmer aims to
further boost defense spending to 3% in the next Parliament, which will
begin in 2029 at the latest after the next general election.</p>

finds mass firings of federal probationary workers likely unlawful</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO — A federal judge in San Francisco on Thursday found
that the mass firings of probationary employees were likely unlawful,
granting temporary relief to a coalition of labor unions and
organizations that has sued to stop the Trump administration’s massive
dismantling of the federal workforce.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge William Alsup ordered the Office of Personnel
Management to inform certain federal agencies that it had no authority
to order the firings of probationary employees, including at the
Department of Defense.</p>
<p>“OPM does not have any authority whatsoever, under any statute in the
history of the universe,” to hire or fire any employees but its own,
Alsup said.</p>
<p>The complaint filed by five labor unions and five nonprofit
organizations is among multiple lawsuits pushing back on the
administration’s efforts to shrink a workforce that Trump has called
bloated and sloppy.</p>
<p>Thousands of probationary employees have already been fired, and his
administration is now aiming at career officials with civil service
protection.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the government agree that the office has no authority to
hire or fire employees in other agencies.</p>
<p>But they said the Office of Personnel Management asked agencies to
review and determine whether employees on probation were fit for
continued employment. They also said that probationary employees are not
guaranteed employment and that only the highest performing and
mission-critical employees should be hired.</p>
<p>“I think plaintiffs are conflating a request by OPM with an order by
OPM,” said Kelsey Helland, an assistant U.S. attorney in court
Thursday.</p>
<p>Attorneys for the coalition cheered the order, although it does not
mean that fired employees will automatically be rehired or that future
firings will not occur.</p>
<p>“What it means in practical effects is the agencies of the federal
government should hear the court’s warning that that order was
unlawful,” said Danielle Leonard, an attorney for the coalition, after
the hearing.</p>
<p>“This ruling by Judge Alsup is an important initial victory for
patriotic Americans across this country who were illegally fired from
their jobs by an agency that had no authority to do so,” said Everett
Kelley, national president of the American Federation of Government
Employees. “These are rank-and-file workers who joined the federal
government to make a difference in their communities, only to be
suddenly terminated due to this administration’s disdain for federal
employees and desire to privatize their work.”</p>
<p>Emails for comment to the Office of Personnel Management and the U.S.
Department of Justice were not immediately returned Thursday.</p>
<p>Alsup ordered the personnel office to inform a limited number of
federal agencies represented by the five nonprofits that are plaintiffs
in the lawsuit, which include veterans, parks, small businesses and
defense. He seemed particularly troubled by firings expected at the
Department of Defense.</p>
<p>He also ordered the acting head of the personnel office, Charles
Ezell, to testify in court about the nature of a Feb. 13 phone call in
which agency heads were told to fire probationary employees.</p>
<p>“The agencies could thumb their noses at OPM if they wanted to if
it’s guidance, but if it’s an order, or cast as an order, the agencies
may think they have to comply,” he said.</p>
<p>Probationary employees say they received a template email</p>
<p>There are an estimated 200,000 probationary workers — generally
employees who have less than a year on the job — across federal
agencies. About 15,000 are employed in California, providing services
ranging from fire prevention to veterans’ care, the complaint says.</p>
<p>Elon Musk has led the purge through the newly created Department of
Government Efficiency, roiling the workforce with demands including a
Saturday email sent through the personnel office ordering workers to
list five things they did last week or risk getting fired. The Office of
Personnel Management later said that the edict was voluntary, although
workers could face similar requests in the future.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs said in their complaint that numerous agencies
informed workers that the personnel office had ordered the terminations,
with an order to use a template e-mail informing workers their firing
was for performance reasons.</p>
<p>Probationary employees of the National Science Foundation, for
example, were told by the foundation that it had decided to retain its
workers but was overruled by the Office of Personnel Management,
according to the complaint.</p>
<p>Unions have recently struck out with two other federal judges.</p>
<p>A judge in Washington, D.C., last week denied a motion from unions to
temporarily block layoffs because he found their complaint should be
heard in federal labor court. Earlier this month, a judge in
Massachusetts said unions suing over a deferred resignation offer
weren’t directly affected and so lacked legal standing to challenge
it.</p>

Navy at a ‘crossroads,’ Trump’s Navy secretary nominee warns</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>pentagon — The Trump administration’s nominee for secretary of the
Navy says the military service branch is at a “crossroads” and must
course correct to expand and improve its maritime capabilities.</p>
<p>“Extended deployments, inadequate maintenance, huge cost overruns,
delayed shipbuilding, failed audits, subpar housing and, sadly,
record-high suicide rates are systemic failures that have gone
unaddressed for far too long. And frankly, this is unacceptable,” John
Phelan told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday.</p>
<p>While Phelan has not served in the military or in government,
committee Chairman Senator Roger Wicker said Trump turned to an
“experienced businessperson” to solve the Navy’s massive industrial
problems, especially in shipbuilding.</p>
<p>“If we threw a zillion dollars at the Department of the Navy today,
we couldn’t build the ships because we don’t have the industrial base.
We’ve got to fix that,” Wicker said.</p>
<p>China’s military, according to Republican Senator Dan Sullivan, is on
pace to have more than 400 ships in its navy this year and will likely
have about 120 more ships than the United States by 2030. The U.S.
currently has about 300 ships.</p>
<p>“Every shipbuilding delay, every maintenance backlog and every
inefficiency is an opening for our adversaries to challenge our
dominance. We cannot allow that to happen,” said Phelan.</p>
<p>He said that if confirmed he would incentivize industry while
learning from “yesterday’s fights” to develop a force for the future.
Phelan also said the Ships for America Act, a bipartisan bill that aims
to establish national oversight and support for the U.S. shipbuilding
industry, would help industry better “telegraph demand” for ships.</p>
<p>The Navy typically receives about 30% of the defense budget.
Republicans and Democrats in Thursday’s hearing criticized what they saw
as financial mismanagement in the Navy and in the defense industry, a
concern that Phelan said he would investigate while developing plans to
tackle shortfalls in the Navy’s military acquisitions.</p>
<p>“When I’ve looked at all these different weapons programs, it seems
like the next missile costs more than the first missile, so you have no
economies of scale,” Phelan told lawmakers. “That is a prescription for
bankruptcy.”</p>
<p>Independent Senator Angus King said the U.S. was falling behind its
adversaries in technological developments such as hypersonics and
directed energy.</p>
<p>Hypersonic weapons can travel at more than five times the speed of
sound and can maneuver to avoid detection and countermeasures.
Directed-energy weapons cause damage with highly focused energy, not
solid projectiles. Examples include lasers and particle beams.</p>
<p>Following the deadly Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terrorist attack on Israel,
Houthi rebels in Yemen launched dozens of drone attacks against
commercial and military ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The U.S.
Navy used missiles valued at hundreds of thousands or even millions of
dollars apiece to destroy the drones.</p>
<p>“Directed energy is about 50 cents a shot, once you have the device
there,” King said.</p>
<p>Hamas and Hezbollah are U.S.-designated terrorist organizations.</p>

id="harsh-flu-season-has-health-officials-worried-about-brain-complications-in-children">Harsh
flu season has health officials worried about brain complications in
children</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — This year’s harsh flu season — the most intense in 15
years — has federal health officials trying to understand if it sparked
an increase in a rare but life-threatening brain complication in
children.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 19,000
people have died from the flu so far this winter, including 86 children.
On Thursday, the CDC reported at least nine of those children
experienced brain complications, and it has asked state health
departments to help investigate if there are more such cases.</p>
<p>There is some good news: The CDC also reported that this year’s flu
shots do a pretty good job preventing hospitalization from the flu —
among the 45% of Americans who got vaccinated. But it comes a day after
the Trump administration canceled a meeting of experts who are supposed
to help choose the recipe for next winter’s flu vaccine.</p>
<p>Still, it’s not too late to get vaccinated this year: “If you haven’t
gotten your flu shot yet, get it because we’re still seeing high flu
circulation in most of the country,” said Dr. Sean O’Leary of the
American Academy of Pediatrics.</p>
<p>Flu shot effectiveness varies from year to year. While not great at
blocking infections, the vaccine’s main role “is to keep you out of the
hospital and to keep you alive,” said Vanderbilt University vaccine
expert Dr. William Schaffner.</p>
<p>Preliminary CDC data released Thursday found that children who got
this year’s vaccine were between 64% and 78% less likely to be
hospitalized than their unvaccinated counterparts, and adults were 41%
to 55% less likely to be hospitalized.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, state health departments and hospitals warned
doctors to watch for child flu patients with seizures, hallucinations or
other signs of “influenza-associated encephalopathy or encephalitis” —
and a more severe subtype called “acute necrotizing encephalopathy.”
Encephalitis is brain inflammation.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the CDC released an analysis of 1,840 child flu deaths
since 2010, finding 166 with those neurologic complications. Most were
unvaccinated children. But the agency concluded it’s unclear if this
year’s nine deaths with those complications — four of whom had the worse
subtype — mark an uptick.</p>
<p>There’s no regular tracking of those neurologic complications, making
it hard to find the answers. In California, Dr. Keith Van Haren of
Stanford Medicine Children’s Health said earlier this month that he’d
learned of about 15 flu-related cases of that severe subtype from
doctors around the country and “we are aware of more cases that may also
meet the criteria.” He did not say how many died.</p>
<p>O’Leary, with the pediatricians’ academy, said parents should
remember this complication is rare — the advice remains to seek medical
advice anytime a child with flu has unusual or concerning symptoms, such
as labored breathing.</p>
<p>Doctors see more neurologic complications during severe flu seasons —
they may be linked to particular influenza strains — and survivors can
have ongoing seizures or other lingering problems, he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, vaccine makers are gearing up for the monthslong process
of brewing next winter’s flu shots. A Food and Drug Administration
advisory committee was supposed to meet on March 13 to help choose which
flu strains to include but with that meeting’s cancellation, it’s
unclear if the government will decide on its own.</p>
<p>“The FDA will make public its recommendations to manufacturers in
time for updated vaccines to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza
season,” Andrew Nixon, communications director for the Department of
Health and Human Services, said in an email.</p>

<h2 id="fort-knox-is-gold-there">Fort Knox: Is gold there?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — “Is the gold there?”</p>
<p>As the decades-old question about the legendary Fort Knox makes
headlines again, U.S. President Donald Trump is on the hunt for
answers.</p>
<p>“We’re actually going to Fort Knox to see if the gold is there,
because maybe somebody stole the gold. Tons of gold,” Trump said
Monday.</p>
<p>His demand for an audit is echoing widely, with public figures like
his cost-cutting czar Elon Musk and Republican Senator Rand Paul of
Kentucky joining the chorus in recent weeks.</p>
<p>“Who is confirming that gold wasn’t stolen from Fort Knox?” Musk
posted on X on Feb. 17. “Maybe it’s there, maybe it’s not. That gold is
owned by the American public! We want to know if it’s still there.”</p>
<p>The allegation is not new. Yet despite Treasury Secretary Scott
Bessent’s assurance about the gold’s presence and annual audits,
suspicion lingers, leading to continued speculation about the state of
the treasure at Fort Knox.</p>
<p>Here is what you need to know about Fort Knox and the latest debate
about its gold deposits.</p>
<p>What is Fort Knox?</p>
<p>The United States Bullion Depository, often called Fort Knox, is an
ultra-secure vault at a World War I-era military installation 56
kilometers (35 miles) south of Kentucky’s largest city, Louisville.</p>
<p>Named after Henry Knox, America’s first secretary of war, Camp Knox
was established in 1918 before becoming a permanent military base,
rebranded as Fort Knox in the 1930s.</p>
<p>The depository was constructed in 1936 to store the government’s
expanding gold reserves that backed the U.S. currency.</p>
<p>In 1937, Fort Knox received its first gold shipment via the U.S.
Mail, and by 1941 held a staggering 649.6 million ounces of gold — four
times its current holdings.</p>
<p>But Fort Knox wasn’t just about gold. During World War II, it
safeguarded America’s founding documents — the Declaration of
Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights — and valuable
items of other governments, such as a copy of the Magna Carta, England’s
13th-century charter of liberties.</p>
<p>How much gold is there today?</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Mint, the depository today houses 147.3 million
ounces of gold, or 5,000 tons. That’s half of the U.S. Treasury’s
reserves, with the remainder stored in other secure facilities around
the country.</p>
<p>A standard gold bar kept at Fort Knox weighs about 12.4 kilograms
(27.5 pounds).</p>
<p>The gold’s book value was set in the 1970s at $42.22 per ounce. At
today’s prices, it is worth $428 billion, according to mining.com.</p>
<p>What is known about the vault’s security?</p>
<p>Fort Knox’s legendary security inspired the phrase “secure as Fort
Knox.” Built with 16,000 cubic feet of granite, 4,200 cubic yards of
concrete, 750 tons of reinforcing steel and 670 tons of structural
steel, the depository building is a formidable fortress.</p>
<p>Inside, the two-story vault has 21-inch-thick, concrete-reinforced
steel walls. The vault door — blast-, drill- and torch-proof — weighs
more than 20 tons and requires 14 turns to open. No single person knows
the procedure to open it, former Mint Director Philip Diehl wrote in a
2023 CoinWeek article.</p>
<p>Guarded by the United States Mint Police and the large military force
at Fort Knox, the facility is nearly impenetrable. Razor wire and
minefields add extra layers of protection, according to Diehl.</p>
<p>Have visitors been allowed inside?</p>
<p>The U.S. Mint calls the depository a “classified facility,” with a
strict “no visitors, no exceptions” policy. Even former presidents have
been barred from visiting.</p>
<p>But in 1974, it did make an exception, opening the vaults to a group
of journalists and members of Congress.</p>
<p>The historic visit, captured on camera and later broadcast on
television, came in response to rumors that large amounts of the gold
had mysteriously vanished.</p>
<p>Four decades later, former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin led a
delegation of Kentucky politicians to view the vaults in 2017.</p>
<p>“Glad gold is safe!” Mnuchin tweeted after the visit.</p>
<p>Prior to these rare visits, President Franklin D. Roosevelt was the
only outsider to enter the vaults, according to the Mint.</p>
<p>Now, pressure is mounting for a new public audit. Conservative radio
host Glenn Beck wrote to Trump recently, asking to bring a camera crew
to Fort Knox “to document and verify the presence of America’s gold
reserves.”</p>
<p>While few doubt the gold’s presence, some industry experts believe
opening the vault doors to the public could end the controversy.</p>
<p>“A full, independent audit — potentially even a livestreamed
verification — would dispel doubts and reinforce trust in U.S. financial
institutions,” mining.com wrote in a commentary.</p>

<h2 id="usagm-announces-kari-lake-as-special-adviser">USAGM announces
Kari Lake as special adviser</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. Agency for Global Media on Thursday announced that
journalist-turned-politician Kari Lake will join the agency as a special
adviser.</p>
<p>A journalist for 30 years, Lake was named by President Donald Trump
in December as the person he would like to have lead Voice of America
(VOA).</p>
<p>Lake’s selection for that role has been slowed while Trump’s pick to
head the USAGM — conservative political activist and writer L. Brent
Bozell III — awaits his Senate confirmation hearing.</p>
<p>The agency is also waiting for a new bipartisan board to be
installed, which will work alongside the CEO on issues including
appointing or dismissing network heads.</p>
<p>Roman Napoli announced Lake’s arrival in an email to the staff.
Napoli is carrying out the duties of USAGM chief executive; the previous
head, Amanda Bennett, resigned.</p>
<p>Lake “brings a wealth of experience in broadcast journalism, having
spent more than two decades as an anchor and reporter in major media
markets,” Napoli wrote.</p>
<p>In highlighting her accomplishments, Napoli said Lake had interviewed
leaders, including two U.S. presidents, and had been awarded two Emmys
for international reporting.</p>
<p>“As Senior Advisor of the Trump Administration, Kari will help USAGM
implement the policies and strategies needed to streamline the agency,
its networks, and its grantees,” the email said.</p>
<p>USAGM oversees several entities dedicated to reporting news and
combating censorship that have a combined weekly audience reach of more
than 420 million. Those organizations include VOA, the Office of Cuba
Broadcasting, and the nonprofits Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio
Free Asia, the Middle East Broadcasting Networks, Open Technology Fund
and Frontline Media Fund.</p>
<p>As well as overseeing the independent networks, USAGM has a stated
mission to “inform, engage, and connect people around the world in
support of freedom and democracy.”</p>
<p>In his email to the staff, Napoli said Lake’s experience “will be
invaluable as we continue our mission to clearly and effectively present
the policies of the Trump Administration around the world.”</p>
<p>USAGM’s public affairs department did not immediately respond to
VOA’s request for comment.</p>
<p>An editorial firewall prevents USAGM from involvement in the
journalistic output of the entities it oversees.</p>
<p>The media outlets under USAGM have been combating disinformation and
propaganda since VOA’s first broadcasts in Nazi Germany during World War
II. It has also attracted criticism for alleged bias, coverage,
mismanagement and security lapses including vetting of staff.</p>
<p>Lake referenced some of the criticism directed at USAGM in her
remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week.</p>
<p>Lake told the audience that as VOA director she will focus the news
agency on producing “accurate and honest reporting.”</p>
<p>“VOA has been telling America’s story to the world for 83 years this
Monday. Sometimes the coverage has been incredible and sometimes it’s
been pitiful,” Lake said. “We are fighting an information war, and
there’s no better weapon than the truth, and I believe VOA could be that
weapon.”</p>
<p>Among those who have called for the network to be cut is Trump
special adviser Elon Musk.</p>
<p>“We won’t become Trump TV,” she said, “but it sure as hell will not
be ‘TDS TV.’ You can find all the Trump Derangement Syndrome that you
want over on CNN, MSNBC, PBS, ‘60 Minutes,’ The Washington Post and The
New York Times.”</p>
<p>As well as a background in journalism, Lake has more recently been a
politician.</p>
<p>She left her job at an Arizona news station over what she has said
she felt was disinformation about the pandemic. She ran unsuccessfully
for governor of Arizona and challenged her loss in lawsuits. A run for
senator was also unsuccessful.</p>

<h2 id="trump-to-hit-canada-mexico-china-with-new-tariffs">Trump to hit
Canada, Mexico, China with new tariffs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday that he would impose 25%
tariffs on imported goods from Canada and Mexico next week as he
originally planned, contending the two neighboring countries are still
not doing enough to curb the flow of drugs into the United States.</p>
<p>In addition, Trump said on his Truth Social media platform that he
also was hitting China with another 10% levy next Tuesday on its exports
to the U.S., on top of the 10% tariff he imposed earlier this month.
China quickly matched the first Trump tariff with one of its own on U.S.
exports.</p>
<p>“Drugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at
very high and unacceptable levels,” Trump said. “A large percentage of
these Drugs, much of them in the form of Fentanyl, are made in, and
supplied by, China.”</p>
<p>Trump first announced the tariffs on Canada and Mexico, two of the
U.S.’s closest allies and trading partners, earlier this month.</p>
<p>But he delayed imposition of the tariffs until March 4 after Mexican
President Claudia Sheinbaum said she would send 10,000 troops to her
country’s northern border to help the U.S. control drug trafficking.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he would name a “fentanyl
czar” to deal with the issue.</p>
<p>Sheinbaum, whose trade-dependent economy sends 80% of its exports to
the U.S., said earlier this week, “We’re expecting to reach a deal with
the United States,” but that if a deal is not reached, Mexico could
impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S.-made products.</p>
<p>When Trump first announced the hefty U.S. tariff on Canadian imports,
Trudeau said it was “entirely unjustified” and promised to impose a 25%
tax starting March 12 on U.S. steel and aluminum products exported to
Canada. Canada is the top exporter of both metals to the U.S.</p>
<p>Economists say the tariffs Trump is imposing are likely to boost
retail prices for consumers and the cost of materials for businesses.
Mexico, Canada and China, in that order, are the three biggest national
trading partners with the U.S., although collectively, the 27-nation
European Union is larger than all three.</p>
<p>Trump, at the first Cabinet meeting of his new presidential term on
Wednesday, said he would “very soon” announce a 25% tariff on EU exports
to the U.S.</p>
<p>With Trump signaling the new tariff on goods sent to the U.S., the EU
vowed to respond “firmly and immediately” to “unjustified” trade
barriers and suggested it would impose its own tariffs on U.S. imports
if Trump proceeded with his.</p>
<p>Trump, in his Truth Social announcement, said reciprocal tariffs on
nations that levy taxes on U.S. exports were still set to take effect on
April 2. He has also hinted at putting tariffs on automobile imports,
lumber, pharmaceutical products and other goods.</p>
<p>Many economists have repeatedly warned that tariffs could lead to
higher prices, boosting troublesome inflation in the U.S. Trump has
acknowledged there could be short-term pain for Americans but he has
contended that tariffs would ultimately be beneficial to the U.S.
economy, the world’s largest.</p>
<p>Trump says the tariffs he is imposing would be an incentive for
foreign companies to do more manufacturing in the United States to avoid

sends 29 prisoners to US as officials meet with Trump team</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MEXICO CITY — Mexico has sent drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, who was
behind the killing of a U.S. DEA agent in 1985, to the United States
with 28 prisoners requested by the U.S. government, a Mexican government
official and other sources confirmed Thursday.</p>
<p>It comes as top Mexican officials are in Washington trying to head
off the Trump administration’s threat of imposing 25% tariffs on all
Mexican imports next week.</p>
<p>The official, who requested anonymity because they were not
authorized to discuss the case, confirmed Caro Quintero’s removal.
Another person familiar with Mexico’s actions also confirmed the removal
on the condition of anonymity because they were unable to discuss
sensitive diplomatic negotiations.</p>
<p>Mexico’s Attorney General’s Office said in a statement that the 29
prisoners sent to the U.S. Thursday faced charges related to drug
trafficking and other crimes.</p>
<p>Also among the list were two leaders of the Los Zetas cartel,
Mexicans Miguel Trevino Morales and his brother Omar Trevino Morales,
known as Z-40 and Z-42, the official confirmed.</p>
<p>The removal of the drug lords from Mexico coincided with a visit to
Washington by Mexico’s Foreign Minister Juan Ramon de la Fuente and
other top economic and military officials. The meeting was the latest in
ongoing negotiations with the U.S. over trade and security relations,
which have radically shifted since U.S. President Donald Trump took
office.</p>
<p>The bilateral talks come just days before the March 4 deadline set by
Trump to apply broad 25% tariffs on Mexican imports, which economists
say would thrust the Mexican economy into recession.</p>
<p>In exchange for delaying tariffs, Trump had insisted that Mexico
crack down on the U.S.-Mexico border, cartels and fentanyl production,
despite significant dips in migration and overdoses over the past year.
The removals may indicate that negotiations are moving along as the
tariff deadline approaches.</p>
<p>Caro Quintero had walked free in 2013 after 28 years in prison when a
court overturned his 40-year sentence for the 1985 kidnapping and
killing of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique “Kiki”
Camarena. The brutal murder marked a low point in U.S.-Mexico
relations.</p>
<p>Caro Quintero, the former leader of the Guadalajara cartel, had since
returned to drug trafficking and unleashed bloody turf battles in the
northern Mexico border state of Sonora until he was arrested by Mexican
forces in 2022.</p>
<p>The removal of the Trevino Morales brothers also marks the end of a
long process that began after the capture in 2013 of Miguel Trevino
Morales and two years later of his brother, Omar. The process wound on
for so many years that then-Mexico’s Attorney General Alejandro Gertz
Manero described the lags as “truly shameful.”</p>
<p>The Trevino Morales family, who have been accused by American
authorities of running the violent northeastern Cartel from prison, have
charges pending in the U.S. for participation in a criminal
organization, drug trafficking, firearms offenses and money
laundering.</p>

id="us-still-opposes-forced-coercive-changes-to-taiwans-status-rubio-says">US
still opposes ‘forced, coercive’ changes to Taiwan’s status, Rubio
says</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday
reaffirmed Washington’s opposition to attempts to alter Taiwan’s status
through force or coercion.</p>
<p>The pledge comes amid growing concerns about the military threat
China poses to the democratically ruled island and worries that Taiwan
may be sidelined as Washington looks to make deals with Beijing.</p>
<p>In an interview with Fox News, Rubio said the best way to prevent a
conflict in the Taiwan Strait is to have a strong U.S. “military
capability,” adding that the United States needs to be “present” in the
Indo-Pacific to deal with China.</p>
<p>“We have a longstanding position on Taiwan that we’re not going to
abandon, and that is: We are against any forced, compelled, coercive
change in the status of Taiwan,” Rubio said.</p>
<p>At the White House on Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump
sidestepped a question about whether he would ensure that “China will
never take Taiwan by force” during his presidency. He indicated that he
does not want to see a war in the Taiwan Strait under his watch.</p>
<p>“I never comment on that. I don’t comment on anything because I don’t
want to ever put myself in that position,” Trump said during a Cabinet
meeting, adding “I have a great relationship with [Chinese] President Xi
[Jinping].”</p>
<p>Some Washington diplomats told VOA that Rubio’s remarks on Wednesday
are in line with the Feb. 7 U.S.-Japan joint statement in which Trump
and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba emphasized the importance of
maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.</p>
<p>During their first official meeting at the White House, the leaders
declared in a statement that their countries “opposed any attempts to
unilaterally change the status quo by force or coercion.”</p>
<p>US urges allies to boost defense</p>
<p>The potential end of the war in Ukraine is one factor that could have
an impact on Taiwan and the U.S. presence in the Indo-Pacific region,
although not all analysts agree.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe that an end to the war in Ukraine would
fundamentally shift U.S. strategic focus toward Asia on its own, since
U.S. policymakers would have to remain concerned about a resumption of
fighting or new Russian attacks against NATO allies,” Zack Cooper, a
senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told VOA.</p>
<p>Others contend the Trump administration has made it clear that NATO
countries are responsible for increasing their defense spending. In this
view, the end of the conflict in Ukraine would allow the U.S. to
redirect its resources toward countering China.</p>
<p>James Fanell, a retired U.S. Navy captain and former director of
intelligence and information operations for the U.S. Pacific Fleet,
said, “One key area will be in naval shipbuilding and restoring the size
and capabilities of the U.S. Navy in the Indo-Pacific, which has
essentially not grown while the PLA [Chinese] Navy now is both the
largest and one of the most lethal navies on the planet.</p>
<p>“It will also be a strong reminder to our allies in the Indo-Pacific
that they, too, will have to increase their own defense spending,”
Fanell said.</p>
<p>‘Today’s Ukraine … tomorrow’s Taiwan’</p>
<p>Former U.S. military officials who have recently visited Taiwan
reported that the island is “definitely concerned about what’s happening
with Ukraine.”</p>
<p>“The idea that one might be abandoned causes them to be petrified and
concerned,” retired Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery, currently a defense
analyst at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said during a
recent FDD webinar.</p>
<p>He said that while Taiwanese think tankers, journalists and
businesspeople are extremely worried, government officials are
refraining from making public statements.</p>
<p>Taiwan has shown solidarity with Ukraine amid Russia’s aggression.
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party has supported U.S. efforts to
assist Kyiv, including the provision of defense equipment to
Ukraine.</p>
<p>DPP leaders have said, “Today’s Ukraine could be tomorrow’s Taiwan,”
drawing parallels between the situations and highlighting the risks
posed by the unchecked aggression of authoritarian governments.</p>
<p>China’s ruling Chinese Communist Party claims sovereignty over Taiwan
and has never ruled out bringing the self-ruled democracy under its
control, even by force. Earlier this week, on the third anniversary of
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Beijing and Moscow reaffirmed their
“no-limits” partnership.</p>
<p>Critics, including Taiwan’s main opposition party, the Kuomintang, or
KMT, have been skeptical about the DPP’s strategy of allying with and
relying on the U.S. to resist China.</p>
<p>Reassuring Indo-Pacific nations</p>
<p>At a diplomatic event late Wednesday, senior U.S. officials provided
reassurance to their allies in the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>Washington’s “America First” policy does not mean “America alone” in
foreign affairs; the United States continues to engage with its allies
in the Indo-Pacific region, said Sean O’Neill, a senior official from
the State Department’s Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs.</p>
<p>He added that the U.S. remains committed to the security and
sovereignty of nations in the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>Andrew Byers, deputy assistant secretary of defense, said that the
U.S., “through robust dialogue and collaboration,” can address shared
priorities to ensure a “free, open, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific
region.”</p>
<p>He said the Trump administration will continue to work “in lockstep
with” allies to achieve it.</p>

id="global-splinters-evident-at-g20-finance-ministers-meeting">Global
splinters evident at G20 finance ministers meeting</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG — The Group of 20 major economies has been instrumental
in coordinating the response to crises like the COVID pandemic. But top
officials from the U.S. and several other member states skipped the G20
finance ministers’ meeting in South Africa this week, raising questions
about the group’s continued relevance in a splintered global
environment.</p>
<p>The two-day meeting in Cape Town ended without a communique, with
current G20 leader South Africa saying there was not sufficient
consensus to issue one.</p>
<p>In his opening remarks at the event, South African President Cyril
Ramaphosa referred to the fractured geopolitical climate and stressed
the importance of international cooperation.</p>
<p>“At this time of global uncertainty and escalating tension, it is now
more important than ever that the members of the G20 should work
together,” Ramaphosa said. “The erosion of multilateralism presents a
threat to global growth and stability.”</p>
<p>He said the G20 finance ministers meeting had to address major issues
like climate change financing, ensuring debt sustainability for
developing countries, and Africa’s need to process its own critical
minerals for inclusive growth.</p>
<p>But it appeared the world’s largest economies were not able to find
common ground on a number of issues. South African Finance Minister
Enoch Godongwana noted this wasn’t the first time.</p>
<p>“The issue of the communique and the absence of it is not something
new,” Godongwana said. “To my knowledge, I mean, since the
Russia-Ukraine war, it has been difficult to find a joint communique.
Now, new differences have emerged on a number of other topics.”</p>
<p>Climate adaptation funding was one of the areas where there was a
“difference of opinion,” he said.</p>
<p>The finance ministers meeting was beset with similar problems faced
by last week’s G20 foreign ministers meeting in Johannesburg, which laid
bare the discord in current geopolitics.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent skipped the event amid a spat
with host country South Africa, and after the U.S. criticized the themes
around climate change and “solidarity, equality and sustainability.”</p>
<p>The finance chiefs of other large economies, including Japan, India
and China also sat it out. However, all of them, including the U.S.,
sent representation at various levels.</p>
<p>Still, the absence of some top officials underscores global divisions
sparked by Russia’s attack on Ukraine and the “America First”
administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, said Professor Alex van
den Heever of the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.</p>
<p>“I think that this has caused a sort of a general review of how
people see global issues,” van den Heever said, “with people becoming a
lot more insular and not really looking at sort of global social
solidarity in any way, shape or form – largely looking to look after
their own situation.”</p>
<p>However, Britain’s chancellor of the exchequer, Rachel Reeves, who
was in Cape Town for the meeting, added to Ramaphosa’s call for unity,
posting on social media platform X, “Productive and successful
collaboration with our international partners is front of mind, now more
than ever.”</p>
<p>Asked about the issue of tariffs, Godongwana said there had been,
“general agreement against protectionism” at the G20 meeting.</p>

id="as-tariffs-expand-focus-also-on-workarounds-for-chinese-goods">As
tariffs expand, focus also on workarounds for Chinese goods</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — As U.S. President Donald Trump moves forward with an
expanding net of tariffs, including an additional 10% for Chinese
imports starting next week, industry insiders and experts say closing
existing loopholes and workarounds that companies use to avoid trade
taxes is also key.</p>
<p>One practice that so far has helped companies from China — and others
— to avoid being hit with tariffs is transshipment, or the transfer of
goods to a second country, where the “Made in China” label is switched
for another.</p>
<p>Berwick Offray, a ribbon manufacturer in the northeastern state of
Pennsylvania, has first-hand experience with the practice. Founded in
1945, the company prides itself on its pledge to keep its products “Made
in the USA” and its position as one of the largest manufacturers of
ribbons in the world.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the company sued a U.S. importer, TriMar Ribbon,
for allegedly buying ribbons produced in China that were shipped to the
United States through India to illegally avoid being subject to
tariffs.</p>
<p>Ribbons made in China are cheaper and sold at below market value
prices in the United States.</p>
<p>“The current allegations allege that TriMar imported ribbons from
China into the United States through transshipment in India, and did not
declare the correct country of origin upon entry,” said a notice issued
from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, when the agency agreed
to investigate the case.</p>
<p>Daniel Pickard, an expert on international trade and an attorney at
Buchanan Ingersoll &amp; Rooney, which represents Berwick Offray, said
there have been numerous cases of transshipment, especially when it
comes to products from China.</p>
<p>“We have assisted several clients in submitting allegations to CBP
against importers of products that have been transshipped from China
through third countries such as Thailand, India and Canada,” Pickard
told VOA. “Our clients typically are the U.S. manufacturers of those
products that are competing against the Chinese imports that are engaged
in evasion of duties.”</p>
<p>According to CBP data, there are currently 221 investigations of
Chinese-made products suspected of transshipment tariff evasion.</p>
<p>Tariffs and loopholes</p>
<p>In early February, the Trump administration rolled out 10% blanket
tariffs on all Chinese goods. On March 4, Chinese imports will face an
additional 10% tariff.</p>
<p>While Trump has worked to reduce potential workarounds, including his
executive order on reciprocal tariffs on trading partners, U.S.
lawmakers have introduced measures to close the loopholes that would
allow Chinese products to evade the president’s increased fees.</p>
<p>Republican Senator Rick Scott introduced the Stopping Adversarial
Tariff Evasion Act on Jan. 31, aiming to strengthen enforcement
mechanisms to ensure foreign manufacturers comply with customs and
duties.</p>
<p>The legislation builds on efforts from Congresswoman Ashley Hinson,
who introduced a bill in December intended to hold China accountable for
tariff evasion by establishing a task force and reporting mechanisms to
deal with instances of financial crime.</p>
<p>Jayant Menon, a senior fellow at the ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute in
Singapore, said the second Trump presidency will foster even more
efforts to monitor tariff evasion and inspect products for
compliance.</p>
<p>“While it is increasingly difficult to determine where a product is
really made these days, given increasing globalization and widespread
production under global supply chain, increased scrutiny can help with
identifying bypass attempts,” Menon said.</p>
<p>“If bypass attempts are suspected, rightly or wrongly, then the
country as a whole may be penalized with new tariffs,” he said.</p>
<p>Pickard said he expects more investigations will be launched by the
new administration. He also looks forward to more efforts to counter
discriminatory practices affecting U.S. companies.</p>
<p>“We anticipate CBP will increase its enforcement efforts as to the
widespread customs fraud involving Chinese products,” he said.</p>
<p>Many stakeholders in the industry, Pickard said, are hoping to see
these issues met with criminal prosecutions.</p>

id="experts-europe-could-not-replace-us-as-guarantor-of-ukraines-security">Experts:
Europe could not replace US as guarantor of Ukraine’s security</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Friedrich Merz, who is set to become Germany’s chancellor after his
Christian Democratic Union party won the country’s Feb. 23 parliamentary
elections, has said that Europe may have to establish an “independent”
defense capability because the U.S. has become “largely indifferent” to
Europe’s fate. </p>
<p>A top priority of any new European defense mechanism would be
protecting Ukraine, now in its fourth year of trying to fight off the
Russian invasion.  </p>
<p>The country has survived thus far in large part because of a heavy
flow of U.S. military aid provided by then-president Joe Biden. New
President Donald Trump has said he wants to end the war and recoup
Washington’s costs, going so far as to demand Ukraine give the U.S.
access to the country’s mineral wealth in return for the tens of
billions of dollars the U.S. has spent on Ukraine’s defense.  </p>
<p>Voice of America’s Russian Service asked experts to assess the
ability of European countries to help Ukraine to withstand, both
militarily and economically, the Russian invasion, and to rebuild its
destroyed infrastructure. </p>
<p>Andriy Zolotarev, director of the Third Sector Analytical Center, a
Kyiv-based think tank, told VOA that U.S. military aid is uniquely
important to Ukraine’s defense.</p>
<p>“In particular, the U.S. has huge stockpiles of weapons, they are a
supplier of critically important intelligence information,” he said.
“All the European countries taken together do not have satellite
groupings like the United States. In addition, the U.S. has extremely
important and truly irreplaceable types of weapons for Ukraine — Patriot
[missile defense] systems, ATACMS [long-range guided missiles], HIMARS
[multiple launch rocket systems], as well as spare parts for armored
vehicles and artillery systems, and much more. This cannot be discounted
in any way.” </p>
<p>According to Zolotarev, while Europe produces advanced weapons and
other military equipment, the European Union together with Great Britain
can only partially compensate for what Ukraine would lose if the U.S.
stopped providing assistance. </p>
<p>“Their efforts can soften the negative effect, but will not avoid
unpleasant consequences,” he said. “This will simply delay the
inevitable end. Europe is currently far from being in the best economic
and military shape.” </p>
<p>Mark Feigin, a self-exiled Russian human rights activist and former
lawyer, noted in an interview with VOA that while Europe includes two
countries with nuclear arsenals, Great Britain and France, and is
collectively far richer than Russia, the continent’s military potential
is hampered by the fact that it is not “a single entity.” </p>
<p>“The strength of the United States is that it makes this or that
decision in a centralized manner, which is then consistently
implemented,” he said. “Europe’s potential is dispersed … In addition,
the political situation in the EU countries is very volatile. … All this
keeps the Europeans from effectively using their obvious advantages [in
the confrontation with Russia].” </p>
<p>Rebuilding Ukraine </p>
<p>Experts believe that Ukraine’s post-war reconstruction will
ultimately be financed by private European investment. According to some
estimates, that may carry a $500 billion to $2 trillion price tag.
However, the longer the war continues, the more difficult the financing
of Ukraine’s reconstruction becomes. But the main question remains — who
will pay for it? </p>
<p>“Well, ideally, it should be Russian money,” said economist Alexey
Bayer. “It should be either some reparations or some taxes, like on
Russian exports, on the export of oil and gas and other minerals.” </p>
<p>However, Bayer told VOA it is “unlikely” that any Russian government,
“even a post-Putin one, will agree to voluntarily pay reparations to
Ukraine.” </p>
<p>While Russian assets frozen in Western banks — including tens of
billions of dollars in foreign currency and gold reserves held by
Russia’s central bank — could be used to rebuild Ukraine, that would
require their complete expropriation. </p>
<p>Many experts say neither the U.S. government nor European governments
would take such a step, despite the heated discussion of this option in
the press. </p>
<p>“It’s one thing to freeze assets; it’s another thing to confiscate
assets,” said Alexander Cooley, a professor of political science at
Barnard College.</p>
<p>“This is the legal struggle at the moment that’s happening in the
U.S. and across EU and Western countries, and this is being constantly
litigated, and it is uncertain territory. … I think you will find the
Trump administration less favorable to seizing Russian assets,
especially as it is moving to settle the conflict, and one of the
primary Russian asks is the unfreezing of their assets and the removal
of most of the sanctions,” he said.</p>
<p>Cliff Kupchan, chairperson of the Eurasia Group, a New York-based
political risk consultancy, agreed that Europe is unlikely to support
seizing frozen Russian assets.</p>
<p>“I think the Europeans are going to remain averse to the idea of
breaking international norms on reserves and fear that Russia will then,
as I think they would, seize Western governmental assets and Western
private assets,” he said. </p>
<p>And while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and various Western
officials and experts have called for a “Marshall Plan” to rebuild
Ukraine — a reference to the massive U.S. aid program to rebuild Western
Europe after World War II — Kupchan said a U.S. initiative on that scale
for Ukraine’s reconstruction is unlikely. </p>
<p>“Right now, the U.S. is not only not interested, but it’s actively
opposed to the idea. Trump thinks that Ukraine is yet another example of
Europe free-riding on American money.” </p>
<p>Still, Kupchan said European investment for reconstruction eventually
will flow into Ukraine, especially if there is a ceasefire that
ultimately holds and there are Western peacekeeping forces to ensure
it. </p>
<p>“I don’t think it will be that slow,” he said in reference to
Ukraine’s post-war reconstruction. “As fast as it would be if there were
a Marshall Plan? No. Stagnant? Also no.”</p>

Perry, Gayle King to join Blue Origin spaceflight</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, FLORIDA — Katy Perry and Gayle King are headed to
space with Jeff Bezos’ fiancee, Lauren Sanchez, and three other
women.</p>
<p>Bezos’ rocket company, Blue Origin, announced the all-female
celebrity crew on Thursday. Sanchez, a helicopter pilot and former TV
journalist, picked the crew who will join her on a 10-minute spaceflight
from west Texas, the company said.</p>
<p>They will blast off sometime this spring aboard a New Shepard rocket.
No launch date was given.</p>
<p>Blue Origin has flown tourists on short hops to space since 2021.
Some passengers have gotten free rides, while others have paid a hefty
sum to experience weightlessness.</p>
<p>It was not immediately known who’s footing the bill for this upcoming
flight.</p>
<p>Sanchez invited singer Perry and TV journalist King, as well as
former NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, research scientist Amanda
Nguyen and movie producer Kerianne Flynn.</p>
<p>This will be Blue Origin’s 11th human spaceflight. Bezos climbed
aboard with his brother for the inaugural flight.</p>

<h2 id="north-korea-behind-1.5-billion-crypto-theft-fbi-says">North
Korea behind $1.5 billion crypto theft, FBI says</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. FBI on Wednesday accused North Korea of being
behind the theft of $1.5 billion worth of digital assets last week, the
largest crypto heist in history.</p>
<p>“(North Korea) was responsible for the theft of approximately $1.5
billion in virtual assets from cryptocurrency exchange, Bybit,” the FBI
said in a public service announcement.</p>
<p>The bureau said a group called TraderTraitor, also known as the
Lazarus Group, was behind the theft.</p>
<p>It said they were “proceeding rapidly and have converted some of the
stolen assets to Bitcoin and other virtual assets dispersed across
thousands of addresses on multiple blockchains.”</p>
<p>“It is expected these assets will be further laundered and eventually
converted to fiat currency,” the FBI added.</p>
<p>Lazarus Group gained notoriety a decade ago when it was accused of
hacking into Sony Pictures as revenge for The Interview, a film that
mocked North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.</p>
<p>North Korea’s cyber-warfare program dates back to at least the
mid-1990s.</p>
<p>It has since grown to a 6,000-strong cyber-warfare unit known as
Bureau 121 that operates from several countries, according to a 2020
U.S. military report.</p>

Supreme Court pauses federal judge’s order on Trump administration
foreign aid funding</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts on Wednesday paused a
federal judge’s order requiring President Donald Trump’s administration
to pay foreign aid funds to contractors and grant recipients.</p>
<p>Roberts issued an interim order placing on hold Washington-based U.S.
District Judge Amir Ali’s action that had imposed a deadline of 11:59
p.m. on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>Roberts provided no rationale for the order, known as an
administrative stay, which will give the court additional time to
consider the administration’s more formal request to block Ali’s
ruling.</p>
<p>Roberts asked for a response from the plaintiffs – organizations that
contract with or receive grants from the U.S. Agency for International
Development and the State Department – by noon on Friday.</p>
<p>The order came after Trump’s administration said in a court filing on
Wednesday it had made final decisions terminating most U.S. foreign aid
contracts and grants, while maintaining that it cannot meet Ali’s
court-ordered deadline.</p>
<p>The administration is cutting more than 90% of the U.S. Agency for
International Development’s foreign aid contracts and over $58 billion
in overall U.S. assistance around the world, a State Department
spokesperson said separately, calling the cuts part of Trump’s “America
First agenda.”</p>
<p>The foreign aid funding dispute arose from a pair of lawsuits brought
by the aid organizations, alleging that the agencies have illegally
frozen all foreign aid payments.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has kept those payments largely frozen
despite a Feb. 13 temporary restraining order from Ali that they be
released, and multiple subsequent orders that the administration comply,
culminating in the Wednesday night deadline.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the U.S. Justice Department have maintained that the
administration has a right to suspend its agreements while it reviews
them to determine whether they comply with administration policy.</p>
<p>That review is now complete, the administration said in its new
filing. It said USAID has made final decisions to cancel nearly 5,800
awards, while keeping more than 500, and that the State Department has
canceled about 4,100 awards, while keeping about 2,700.</p>
<p>An administration official said in an earlier court filing that
grounds for terminating contracts include that they were related to
diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility efforts, or were deemed
wasteful.</p>
<p>Trump has taken a hard line on programs related to diversity, equity
and inclusion, signing an executive order in his second day in office
last month directing federal agency chiefs to dismantle DEI
policies.</p>
<p>The administration said on Wednesday that Secretary of State Marco
Rubio had ordered that past-due invoices from the plaintiffs for work
before Jan. 24, when the payment freeze began, to be “expedited for
payment without the ordinary vetting procedures, in a good-faith effort
to comply” with Ali’s order. It said that while some money would be paid
on Wednesday, full payments could take weeks.</p>
<p>Funding freeze undermines relief efforts</p>
<p>Trump, a Republican, ordered a 90-day pause on all foreign aid on his
first day in office last month. That order, and ensuing stop-work orders
halting USAID operations around the world, have jeopardized the delivery
of life-saving food and medical aid, throwing global humanitarian relief
efforts into chaos.</p>
<p>USAID administers some 60% of U.S. foreign assistance and disbursed
$43.79 billion in fiscal 2023. According to a Congressional Research
Service report this month, its workforce of 10,000, of which about
two-thirds serves overseas, assisted about 130 countries.</p>
<p>Trump’s administration on Sunday said it was placing all but leaders
and critical staff at USAID on paid administrative leave and eliminating
1,600 positions. Employee unions have sued to challenge the cuts, though
a judge last week allowed them to go ahead.</p>
<p>Ali, who was appointed by Trump’s Democratic predecessor, former
President Joe Biden, issued his temporary restraining order to prevent
irreparable harm to the plaintiffs while he considers their claims.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs allege Trump has exceeded his authority under federal
law and the U.S. Constitution by effectively dismantling an independent
agency and canceling spending authorized by Congress.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs have said the administration has not done anything to
comply with the restraining order, and some have said they will shut
down within days if they are not paid.</p>
<p>“The lengths that the government is willing to go to flout a court
order, all for the goal of ending life-saving humanitarian assistance,
is staggering,” said Allison Zieve, a lawyer representing two
plaintiffs, AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and Journalism Development
Network, on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Other plaintiffs include international development company DAI Global
and refugee assistance organization HIAS.</p>
<p>Both Ali and a Rhode Island federal judge in a separate case over a
broader federal payment freeze have castigated the Trump administration
for failing to follow their orders. The administration in both cases has
maintained it is trying in good faith to interpret and comply with the
orders.</p>

US service members to be separated from military, Pentagon memo
shows</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Transgender service members will be separated from the
U.S. military unless they receive an exemption, according to a Pentagon
memo filed in court on Wednesday, essentially banning them from joining
or serving in the military.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month that took
aim at transgender troops in a personal way – at one point saying that a
man identifying as a woman was “not consistent with the humility and
selflessness required of a service member.”</p>
<p>This month, the Pentagon had said that the U.S. military will no
longer allow transgender individuals to join and will stop performing or
facilitating procedures associated with gender transition for service
members.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s late-evening memo goes further.</p>
<p>The memo said that the Pentagon must create a procedure to identify
troops who are transgender within 30 days and then within 30 days of
that, must separate them from the military.</p>
<p>“It is the policy of the United States Government to establish high
standards for service member readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty,
humility, uniformity, and integrity,” said the memo, dated Feb. 26.</p>
<p>“This policy is inconsistent with the medical, surgical, and mental
health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria or who have a
current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with,
gender dysphoria,” it added.</p>
<p>The military has about 1.3 million active-duty personnel, according
to Department of Defense data. Although transgender rights advocates say
there are as many as 15,000 transgender service members, officials say
the number is in the low thousands.</p>

<h2 id="british-pm-starmer-to-meet-trump-at-white-house">British PM
Starmer to meet Trump at White House</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to meet with
President Donald Trump at the White House on Thursday to address the
ongoing conflict in Ukraine and bilateral trade ties, amid the U.S.
leader’s tariff threats on Europe and demands that the continent rely
less on Washington for its security.</p>
<p>Ahead of their meeting, Trump, who wants NATO members to boost
defense spending to 5% of their Gross Domestic Product, reiterated his
stance that Europe should “step up.” He told reporters at the White
House on Wednesday that American taxpayers “shouldn’t be footing the
bill than – more than the Europeans are paying.”</p>
<p>In what appears to be a move to appease Trump, on Tuesday, Starmer
announced an unexpected increase in the U.K. defense budget to 2.5% of
the nation’s GDP by 2027, then to 2.6% the following year.</p>
<p>“This week when I meet President Trump, I will be clear: I want this
relationship to go from strength to strength,” Starmer told members of
the British Parliament, underscoring what he calls his country’s “most
important bilateral alliance,” with the U.S.</p>
<p>Starmer told reporters Tuesday that the increase in defense spending
was “three years in the making,” following Russia’s 2022 invasion of
Ukraine. The increase will be funded by cutting Britain’s already
depleted foreign aid budget to just 0.3% of the country’s GDP.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that the decision to ramp up defense spending was
“accelerated” as Trump moves to negotiate with Moscow without the
involvement of Ukraine or Europeans and made clear he is reducing U.S.
support for Europe’s security.</p>
<p>“President Trump thinks we should do more, and I agree with him. It
chimes with my thinking on this,” Starmer said. He said he also aims to
further increase defense spending to 3% in the next Parliament, which
will begin in 2029 at the latest after the next general election.</p>
<p>A key message for Starmer to reinforce is that Europeans must be part
of any discussions on Ukraine, said Gesine Weber, a fellow on the German
Marshall Fund’s Geostrategy team.</p>
<p>“Because it would be very odd to have a situation where you have the
burden shift to Europeans, but not the strategic responsibility and the
strategic reflections,” she told VOA.</p>
<p>In 2023, the U.S. spent 3.4% of its GDP on defense, according to U.S.
government data compiled by the Stockholm International Peace Research
Insititute.</p>
<p>European peacekeeping</p>
<p>Starmer’s meeting comes on the heels of Emmanuel Macron’s White House
visit on Monday. The French president has proposed creating a European
peacekeeping force in Ukraine as a security guarantee against future
Russian aggression, a plan endorsed by Starmer.</p>
<p>Under this scenario, the United States “would do less in normal
times, but be available as sort of a backstop,” when a crisis breaks,
said Michael O’Hanlon of the Brookings Institution.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the plan will come to fruition
considering the various interests within NATO and European Union,
O’Hanlon told VOA.</p>
<p>“The most important thing, do these guys get along? Do they have a
common vision?” he said of Trump and Starmer, because that could signal
the emergence of a Western strategy to end the war with NATO’s
support.</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, then we’re in a good position to try to promote
a negotiation between Russia and Ukraine,” he added.</p>
<p>On Wednesday Trump signaled Ukraine should “forget about” a path
toward NATO membership and that it should not expect much from
Washington.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to make security guarantees beyond very much — we’re
going to have Europe do that because we’re talking about Europe is their
next-door neighbor.”</p>
<p>Aside from negotiating with Moscow, Trump is also pushing Kyiv for a
deal that would allow American access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals
and recoup funds given by the Biden administration to support the
country’s war efforts.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to meet Trump at the
White House on Friday.</p>
<p>Tariff threats</p>
<p>The visit is a challenge for Starmer as he seeks to balance the
U.K.’s interests with those of its European allies while engaging with
an unpredictable U.S. administration.</p>
<p>He is keen to secure favorable terms amid potential U.S. tariffs that
could impact British exports as the U.S. hits European countries with
25% tariffs on steel and aluminum. Trump is threatening more, saying the
European Union has been “very unfair” to America.</p>
<p>Starmer is “in a bit delicate position” as the U.K. is not part of
the European Union single market, said GMF’s Weber.</p>
<p>“So for him, the question is basically averting the situation where
there are U.S. tariffs and of course also trying to appease Washington
in that regard, while he’s also not going on a super confrontational
line with the European Union,” she said.</p>
<p>British finance minister Rachel Reeves said on Wednesday she was
confident that U.S.-U.K. trade and investment would not be derailed amid
Trump’s tariff threats.</p>

$5 million ‘gold card’ plan sparks immigration confusion</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Immigration law experts expressed confusion on Wednesday, the day
after President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. would begin selling
a gold card visa for $5 million that would allow wealthy foreigners to
live and work in the U.S. and provide them with “a route to
citizenship.”</p>
<p>In remarks in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump and Commerce
Secretary Howard Lutnick said the program would begin in two weeks and
replace the EB-5 visa program that allows foreign investors to live and
work in the U.S. if they invest in companies that create jobs for
Americans.</p>
<p>The EB-5 visa program, however, was created by an act of Congress in
1990, and it is unclear whether Trump has the authority to do away with
it or to establish a new visa program without congressional action.</p>
<p>“We have it all worked out from the legal standpoint. It’s totally
legal to do,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Questions about legality</p>
<p>Immigration lawyers flatly disagreed.</p>
<p>“The truth is the president would need Congress to pass an act
allowing for this new vehicle,” said Michael Wildes, a practicing
immigration law attorney who also teaches the subject at Cardozo Law
School in New York City.</p>
<p>Wildes, who has represented first lady Melania Trump and members of
her family in immigration matters, said that so little information has
been made available about the program that it is difficult to gauge how
large an impact it is likely to have.</p>
<p>The information that has been released, however, reflects the
president’s approach to issues such as immigration, he said.</p>
<p>“He will treat people with deeper pockets more handsomely than
others,” Wildes told VOA. “This is consistent with his ethic.”</p>
<p>“If the administration is proposing to rework the terms of the EB-5
program, that is blatantly illegal,” Jorge Loweree, managing director of
programs and strategy for the American Immigration Council, told VOA.
“The parameters of that program were designed by our legislative branch.
The president can’t rewrite them on a whim.”</p>
<p>David J. Bier, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute,
wrote “Selling green cards is good in theory, but Trump’s specific
proposal has some problems.” One, he wrote, is that “President Trump
cannot lawfully eliminate Congress’s EB‑5 investor program.”</p>
<p>The White House did not respond to a request for comment from
VOA.</p>
<p>Oval Office announcement</p>
<p>Trump revealed the plan to a group of reporters in the Oval Office on
Tuesday, saying that the new offering would be superior to the document
currently issued to foreigners with permanent residency status, commonly
known as a green card.</p>
<p>“We’re going to be selling a gold card,” Trump said. “You have the
green card? This is a gold card. We’re going to be putting a price on
that card of about $5 million, and that’s going to give you green card
privileges plus. It’s going to be a route to citizenship, and wealthy
people will be coming into our country by buying this card.”</p>
<p>The president did not explain what privileges a gold card holder
would enjoy that green card holders do not. He also did not explain what
he meant by a “route to citizenship.”</p>
<p>Trump said that in addition to wealthy foreigners who want to live in
the United States, he believes that U.S. corporations will be willing to
buy the cards so that they can hire talented workers from outside the
country.</p>
<p>“Companies will pay for people to get in and to have long-term status
in the country,” he said.</p>
<p>There are already several pathways available to foreigners who want
to come work in the U.S. The H1-B visa program allows thousands of
skilled workers into the country every year. In addition, there are
several visa programs that allow executives of international companies
to live and work in the U.S. if they are transferred to a U.S. office or
affiliate.</p>
<p>EB-5 program targeted</p>
<p>Commerce Secretary Lutnick said Tuesday that the administration plans
to discontinue the existing EB-5 visa program, which he described as
“full of nonsense, make-believe and fraud.”</p>
<p>The EB-5 program provides green card status to foreigners who invest
$1,050,000 in companies in the U.S. that create at least 10 jobs. The
amount can be lowered to $800,000 if the investment is made in certain
types of infrastructure or in parts of the country the government has
targeted for economic development.</p>
<p>Lutnick appeared to say that the $5 million fee for a gold card would
not have to go toward job-creating investment; instead, it would go
directly into federal coffers.</p>
<p>“We can use that money to reduce our deficit,” he said.</p>
<p>Higher bar for entry</p>
<p>Shereen Chen, an immigration attorney who practices in New Jersey,
told VOA that for many wealthy foreigners hoping to come to the U.S.,
the new rules could complicate the process.</p>
<p>The current rules include a “stringent vetting program” to ensure
that money invested under the EB-5 program was earned legitimately, Chen
said. The process is lengthy and difficult and will only become more so,
Chen said, if the amount of money being vetted increases fivefold.</p>
<p>The new program would have dire implications for Chinese nationals
hoping to come to the U.S. While many Chinese have made use of the EB-5
program, tighter monetary controls in China have made doing so
increasingly difficult.</p>
<p>“Right now, it’s very hard for Chinese nationals to use the EB-5
program, even at $1,050,000, because it’s very hard for them to get
money out of China,” Chen said.</p>
<p>Common practice</p>
<p>The U.S. is far from alone in having policies on its books that allow
wealthy foreigners to trade investment for residency privileges.</p>
<p>Henley &amp; Partners, a London-based consultancy that advises
clients seeking international residency and citizenship options, tracks
programs in more than 100 countries that offer some sort of
investment-for-residence program.</p>
<p>About 30 jurisdictions offer citizenship in exchange for investment,
a deal commonly known as a “golden passport.” In recent years, the
European Union has been pressing member states with such programs to
eliminate them out of concern that they abet illegal activity such as
tax evasion and money laundering.</p>

id="survey-decline-in-number-of-us-christians-is-leveling-off">Survey:
Decline in number of US Christians is leveling off</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The number of Americans who identify as Christian has
declined steadily for years, but that drop shows signs of slowing,
according to a new survey Wednesday from the Pew Research Center.</p>
<p>The Religious Landscape Study finds 62% of U.S. adults call
themselves Christians. While a significant dip from 2007, when 78% of
Americans identified as Christian, Pew found the Christian share of the
population has remained relatively stable since 2019.</p>
<p>The rapid rise of the religiously unaffiliated — the so-called
“nones” — has also reached at least a temporary plateau, according to
Pew. Approximately 29% of U.S. adults identify as religiously
unaffiliated, including those who are atheist (5%), agnostic (6%) or
“nothing in particular” (19%).</p>
<p>“It’s striking to have observed this recent period of stability in
American religion after that long period of decline,” said Pew’s Gregory
Smith, one of the study’s co-authors. “One thing we can’t know for sure
is whether these short-term signs of stabilization will prove to be a
lasting change in the country’s religious trajectory.”</p>
<p>By some measures, the U.S. remains overwhelmingly spiritual. Many
Americans have a supernatural outlook, with 83% believing in God or a
universal spirit and 86% believing that people have a soul or spirit.
About seven in 10 Americans believe in heaven, hell or both.</p>
<p>Young adults are less religious than their elders</p>
<p>Despite this widespread spirituality, there are harbingers of future
religious decline. Most notably, Pew found a huge age gap, with 46% of
the youngest American adults identifying as Christian, compared to 80%
of the oldest adults. The youngest adults are also three times more
likely than the oldest group to be religiously unaffiliated.</p>
<p>“These kinds of generational differences are a big part of what’s
driven the long-term declines in American religion,” Smith said. “As
older cohorts of highly religious, older people have passed away, they
have been replaced by new cohorts of young adults who are less religious
than their parents and grandparents.”</p>
<p>Michele Margolis, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist
not affiliated with the Pew survey, has studied how religious
involvement changes over a lifetime.</p>
<p>Young adults frequently move away from religion. “Then when you get
married and have kids, this is a time where scholars have noted that
religion is more likely to become important,” Margolis said.</p>
<p>Margolis said one question going forward is whether the youngest
American adults firmly reject organized religion, or if some of them
will return to the religious fold as they age.</p>
<p>Between 2007 and 2024, Pew religious landscape studies haven’t
indicated that Americans are growing more religious as they get
older.</p>
<p>Smith at Pew said “something would need to change” to stop the
long-term decline of American religion, whether that’s adults becoming
more religious with age or new generations becoming more religious than
their parents.</p>
<p>How partisan politics intertwines with religious identity</p>
<p>The long-term decline of U.S. Christianity and rise of the “nones”
has occurred across traditions, gender, race, ethnicity, education and
region. But it is much more evident among political liberals, according
to Pew. The survey shows 51% of liberals claim no religion, up 24 points
from 2007. Only 37% of U.S. liberals identify as Christian, down from
62% in 2007.</p>
<p>Penny Edgell, a University of Minnesota sociologist and expert
adviser for the Pew study, said this religious and political sorting
aligns with whether people “support traditional, patriarchal gender and
family arrangements.”</p>
<p>Edgell also notes that Black Americans defy the assumption that all
Democrats are less religious than Republicans.</p>
<p>“More Black Americans percentagewise are Democrats, but their rates
of religious involvement are still really high,” Edgell said. “That has
something to do with the way that religious institutions and politics
have been intertwined in historically unique ways for different
groups.”</p>
<p>Roughly seven in 10 Black Protestants told Pew that religion is very
important to them — about the same rate as evangelicals and members of
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. But Black Protestants
are likely to identify as Democrats (72%), whereas evangelicals and
Latter-day Saints are likely to identify as Republican (70% and 73%,
respectively).</p>
<p>The Pew survey tracks many religious traditions</p>
<p>It’s been nearly 10 years since the last Religious Landscape Study,
which tracks religious data that the U.S. census does not.</p>
<p>The new survey found that a majority of immigrants to the U.S. are
Christian (58%), but they also follow the upward trend of the
religiously unaffiliated, with a quarter of foreign-born U.S. adults
claiming no religion.</p>
<p>The number of Americans who belong to religions besides Christianity
has been increasing, though it’s still a small portion of the population
(7%). That includes the 2% who are Jewish, and the 1% each who are
Muslim, Buddhist or Hindu.</p>
<p>Of U.S. Christian adults, 40% are Protestant and 19% are Catholic.
The remaining 3% in Pew’s survey include Latter-day Saints, Orthodox
Christians, Jehovah’s Witnesses and smaller Christian groups.</p>
<p>The two largest Protestant denominations in the Pew survey remain the
Southern Baptist Convention and the United Methodist Church – though
both have lost many members since the first Religious Landscape Study in
2007.</p>
<p>The Pew Religious Landscape Study was conducted in English and
Spanish between July 2023 and March 2024, among a nationally
representative sample of 36,908 respondents in all 50 states and the
District of Columbia. The survey’s margin of error for results based on
the full sample is plus or minus 0.8 percentage points.</p>

resists federal call to stop its tolls to prevent traffic
congestion</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Trump administration wants New York City to end its congesting
pricing, an automatic toll program designed to reduce the
bumper-to-bumper traffic in the city’s business area from 60th Street
and below. But New York’s governor is fighting back.</p>
<p>In a letter dated Feb. 20 and made public Wednesday, Gloria Shepherd,
executive director of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA),
informed New York City and state transportation officials that FHWA
officials would contact them “to discuss the orderly cessation of toll
operations” under the Central Business District Tolling Program.
Shepherd said termination of the program should be effective March
21.</p>
<p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul and the Metropolitan Transit Authority
have filed a lawsuit to prevent ending the toll operation that the
federal authorities approved and that has yielded millions of dollars
for New York City since it began in January.</p>
<p>Hochul told a recent MTA board meeting that while the federal
government has called for an “orderly cessation” of the program, she is
proposing “orderly resistance.”</p>
<p>“I guarantee that the president has never had to endure missing a
child’s sporting event because they were stuck on a delayed train. Never
had to stand in a flooded subway station because we were not able to
make the repairs. Not sitting in traffic, missing an important meeting
because you couldn’t get around,” Hochul told the MTA board.</p>
<p>The congestion pricing program began Jan. 5. The revenue from the
tolls from Jan. 5 to Jan. 31 totaled $48.66 million, with a net of $37.5
million.</p>
<p>The toll program is on track to generate about $500 million for the
MTA by year’s end, MTA CEO Janno Lieber said, allowing the authority to
progress with its plans for bus, subway and transit improvements.</p>
<p>Some information for this report came from The Associated Press.</p>

<h2 id="trump-ends-permit-to-export-venezuelan-oil-to-us">Trump ends
permit to export Venezuelan oil to US</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CARACAS, VENEZUELA — A permit issued by the United States government
allowing energy giant Chevron Corp. to pump and export Venezuelan oil
will be terminated this week, President Donald Trump announced
Wednesday, ending what became a financial lifeline for the South
American country.</p>
<p>Trump’s announcement in his Truth Social network accused the
government of President Nicolás Maduro of not meeting democratic
conditions for last year’s July presidential election as well as of not
moving fast enough to transport back to Venezuela immigrants set for
deportation.</p>
<p>“We are hereby reversing the concessions that Crooked Joe Biden gave
to Nicolas Maduro, of Venezuela, on the oil transaction agreement,”
Trump wrote.</p>
<p>Trump’s post did not specifically mention California-based Chevron
nor the permit, formally known as a general license, that exempts the
company from economic sanctions and allows it to export and sell
Venezuelan oil in the U.S. But it is the only Venezuela-related license
whose issuance and renewal information match the dates Trump did mention
in his social media post.</p>
<p>The administration of President Joe Biden authorized the license in
2022 after Maduro agreed to work with Venezuela’s political opposition
toward a democratic election. But the election, which took place in July
2024, was neither fair nor free, and Maduro was sworn in last month for
a third six-year term despite credible evidence that his opponent got
more votes.</p>
<p>Biden’s government resisted for months calls from Venezuela’s
opposition and others to rescind the license, whose goal the U.S.
initially said was “to support the restoration of democracy.” The
opposition has estimated that Maduro’s government has received about $4
billion through the permit, which was set to be renewed Saturday.</p>
<p>Over time, the license has become responsible for roughly a quarter
of Venezuela’s oil production.</p>
<p>“We are aware of today’s announcement and are considering its
implications,” Chevron spokesperson Bill Turenne said in a statement.
“Chevron conducts its business in Venezuela in compliance with all laws
and regulations, including the sanctions framework provided by U.S.
government.”</p>
<p>Venezuela sits atop the world’s largest proven oil reserves and once
used them to power Latin America’s strongest economy. But corruption,
mismanagement and eventual U.S. economic sanctions saw production
decline steadily.</p>
<p>More than 7.7 million Venezuelans have left their homeland since
2013, when the oil-dependent economy came undone, and Maduro became
president. Most settled in Latin America and the Caribbean, but after
the pandemic, they increasingly set their sights on the U.S.</p>
<p>Chevron, which first invested in Venezuela in the 1920s, does
business in the country through joint ventures with the state-owned
company Petroleos de Venezuela S.A., commonly known as PDVSA.</p>
<p>The joint ventures produced about 200,000 barrels of oil a day in
2019. The following year, U.S. sanctions imposed by Trump’s first
administration to try to topple Maduro forced Chevron to wind down
production. When the company got the license to export oil to the U.S.
in November 2022, the joint ventures quickly began producing 80,000
barrels a day, and by 2024, they topped their daily output from
2019.</p>
<p>The terms of the license bar Chevron from directly paying taxes or
royalties to Venezuela’s government. But the company sends money to the
joint ventures, which are majority-owned by PDVSA.</p>
<p>It is unclear how Maduro’s government used that money, because it
stopped publishing almost all financial data several years ago. On
Wednesday, opposition leader Maria Corina Machado in a podcast interview
with Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., accused Maduro of using the funds
for “for repression, persecution and corruption.”</p>
<p>“This is a huge step, and it sends a clear, clear, firm message that
Maduro is in huge trouble,” she said.</p>

id="trump-orders-large-federal-layoffs-musk-to-seek-deeper-spending-cuts">Trump
orders large federal layoffs; Musk to seek deeper spending cuts</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration on
Wednesday ordered federal agencies to undertake more large-scale layoffs
of federal workers, as downsizing czar Elon Musk vowed at Trump’s first
Cabinet meeting to pursue deeper spending cuts.</p>
<p>A new administration memo instructed agencies to submit plans by
March 13 for a “significant reduction” in staffing to the federal
workforce. It did not specify numbers of desired layoffs.</p>
<p>The memo, signed by White House budget director Russell Vought and
Office of Personnel Management acting head Charles Ezell, represents a
major escalation in Trump and Musk’s campaign to slash the size of the
U.S. government.</p>
<p>Thus far, the layoffs have focused on probationary workers, who have
less tenure in their current roles and enjoy fewer job protections. The
next round would target the vastly bigger pool of veteran civil
servants.</p>
<p>At the Cabinet meeting, Trump said Lee Zeldin, the Environmental
Protection Agency administrator, plans to cut up to 65% of his more than
15,000 employees.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, an Interior Department source told Reuters that bureaus
such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Indian
Affairs should prepare for workforce reductions ranging from 10% to
40%.</p>
<p>About 100,000 of the nation’s 2.3 million civilian federal workers
have been fired or taken buyouts since Trump took office.</p>
<p>Trump gave Musk an extraordinary sign of support for the cost-cutting
campaign by inviting the billionaire to the Cabinet meeting and asking
him to speak about the work of his Department of Government Efficiency,
which is overseeing the overhaul. DOGE is not a Cabinet-level
department.</p>
<p>Musk expressed confidence that he could cut the $6.7 trillion budget
by $1 trillion this year. Such an ambitious target would likely entail
significant disruption of government programs.</p>
<p>Without such deep spending cuts, Musk said, “the country will go de
facto bankrupt.”</p>
<p>Later Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order directing agencies
to work with DOGE to review and terminate all “unnecessary” contracts
and instructing the General Services Administration, which manages the
government’s real estate, to create a plan for disposing of any unneeded
property.</p>
<p>Thus far, Trump and Musk have failed to slow the rate of spending.
According to a Reuters analysis, the government spent 13% more during
Trump’s first month in office than during the same time last year,
largely because of higher interest payments on the debt and rising
health and retirement costs incurred by an aging population.</p>
<p>Trump reiterated his promise to refrain from cutting popular health
and retirement benefits that account for nearly half of the budget.</p>
<p>“We’re not going to touch it,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Trump is simultaneously pushing Congress to extend the 2017 tax cuts,
the signature legislative accomplishment of his first term, which are
set to expire at year’s end. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible
Federal Budget estimates the 2017 cuts added $2.5 trillion to the
nation’s debt — now $36 trillion. It estimated that extending the tax
cuts could cost more than $5 trillion over a decade.</p>
<p>Republicans are weighing cuts to health care and food aid for the
poor to help pay for the tax cuts, though specifics have not yet
emerged.</p>
<p>Workers ‘on the bubble’</p>
<p>Some of the Cabinet secretaries were taken by surprise over the
weekend when federal workers received an email requiring them to list
their accomplishments for the week, a demand that Musk said would result
in termination if ignored.</p>
<p>Some agencies told employees to ignore the directive, prompting days
of confusion over whether Musk and Trump could make good on the
threat.</p>
<p>Musk, the world’s richest person, told the Cabinet meeting his email
was an attempt to find out whether government paychecks were going to
actual workers.</p>
<p>“We think there are a number of people on the government payroll who
are dead,” he said, without providing evidence.</p>
<p>Trump suggested that the roughly 1 million workers who did not
respond to Musk’s email might be at risk of losing their jobs.</p>
<p>“They are on the bubble,” he said, using a term that refers to a
situation that has an uncertain outcome.</p>
<p>Trump and Musk’s unprecedented government overhaul has also frozen
foreign aid and disrupted construction projects and scientific
research.</p>
<p>The GSA, informally known as the government’s landlord, plans to
terminate 1,100 leases for office space by the end of the year,
according to a person briefed on the matter.</p>

<h2 id="us-lawmakers-seek-compromise-on-government-funding-bills">US
lawmakers seek compromise on government funding bills</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump addressed concerns Wednesday that
legislation funding the federal government past a March 14 deadline
would include controversial cuts to social safety net programs such as
Medicaid and Social Security. </p>
<p>“We’re not going to touch it,” Trump told reporters, “Now we are
going to look for fraud. I’m sure you’re OK with that, like people that
shouldn’t be off, people that are illegal aliens and other criminals.”
 </p>
<p>Those cuts are one of the issues lawmakers are racing to resolve
before a short-term spending bill runs out in just over two weeks. The
House of Representatives passed a budget resolution 217-215 late Tuesday
when Speaker of the House Mike Johnson secured enough votes from within
his party.  </p>
<p>“We promised to deliver President [Donald] Trump’s full agenda, not
just a part of it, not just a little bit of it now and return for the
rest,” Johnson told reporters earlier Tuesday.   </p>
<p>The House and Senate bills will now have to be compromised to be
signed into law.  </p>
<p>Before the vote, several members of the House Republican conference
were still concerned about the size of the spending measure, how and
when to enact a proposed extension of the 2017 tax cuts, and the
political impact of cutting social safety net programs that benefit many
American voters.    </p>
<p>“Not only are we working to find savings for the American taxpayer, a
better, more efficient use of their dollar, which we are morally
obligated to do, we also have a moral obligation to bend the curve on
the debt,” Johnson said Tuesday.   </p>
<p>Trump has called for lawmakers to pass “one big, beautiful bill” that
will be a key part of enacting his domestic policy agenda.   </p>
<p>Despite Trump expressing his preference for the House version of the
budget, the Senate last week passed a funding resolution that provides
$150 billion in military funding and $175 billion for border security.
That measure also avoids the controversial Medicaid cuts of the House
version.   </p>
<p>In a statement Wednesday, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey
Graham warned, “Time is of the essence when it comes to border security.
ICE will run out of money in weeks, not months. Stalling President
Trump’s border security agenda is not only bad politics, it is
dangerous.” </p>
<p>Trump posted on Truth Social last week that “The House and Senate are
doing a SPECTACULAR job of working together as one unified, and
unbeatable, TEAM, however, unlike the Lindsey Graham version of the very
important Legislation currently being discussed, the House Resolution
implements my FULL America First Agenda, EVERYTHING, not just parts of
it!”   </p>
<p>If lawmakers cannot reach a compromise by March 14, there will be a
partial government shutdown, leaving millions of federal employees
temporarily without pay and suspending some nonessential government
services.      </p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune did not rule out the possibility of
another short-term spending bill to give lawmakers more time to work.
  </p>
<p>“We’re keeping all the options on the table, but we are running out
of time,” Thune told reporters Tuesday.   </p>
<p>The Senate moved forward with a vote on its version of the budget due
to uncertainty over the potential success of the vote on the House
version.      </p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer characterized the vote as a
first step toward hurting voters.      </p>
<p>“Last night, almost every single House Republican signed their names
to what would be the largest Medicaid cuts in American history. The
havoc, the damage that would do to tens of millions of American families
would be almost unprecedented when it comes to Medicaid,” Schumer said
on the Senate floor Wednesday. </p>
<p>“The Republican agenda is quickly taking shape: Under Donald Trump’s
Republican Party, billionaires win, American families lose,” Schumer
said.</p>

id="security-experts-highlight-pros-cons-of-ukraine-us-minerals-deal">Security
experts highlight pros, cons of Ukraine-US minerals deal</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Ukraine and the United States are set to sign a landmark minerals
agreement, marking a significant step toward strengthening economic ties
between the two nations. However, security experts tell VOA that
concerns persist about the broader implications of the deal. </p>
<p>Ukraine’s Cabinet of Ministers approved the agreement Wednesday and
U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed that Ukrainian leader Volodymyr
Zelenskyy will visit the White House on Friday to sign it.</p>
<p>The deal includes provisions for the co-ownership and management of a
post-war reconstruction fund for Ukraine, to which Ukraine will allocate
50% of future revenues from the country’s natural resources.</p>
<p>The agreement states that the U.S. will maintain a “long-term
financial commitment to the development of a stable and economically
prosperous Ukraine.” </p>
<p>The deal makes no direct reference to efforts to end Russia’s
invasion of Ukraine, though, or about future security arrangements for
the Eastern European country, apart from a single line: “The Government
of the United States of America supports Ukraine’s efforts to obtain
security guarantees needed to establish lasting peace.” </p>
<p>While the deal aims to unlock Ukraine’s mineral wealth and bolster
its economic recovery, security experts warn it may fall short in
addressing Ukraine’s ongoing security challenges amid continued Russian
aggression. </p>
<p>American business perspective </p>
<p>Andy Hunder, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in
Ukraine, explained to VOA by telephone that the deal aims to establish a
new American-Ukrainian fund, focusing on state-owned enterprises and
Ukraine’s rich subsoil resources, including gas, oil, and critical
minerals.</p>
<p>A representative of American business in Ukraine, Hunder expressed
optimism about the agreement’s potential impact: “We’re excited.
Professional fund managers can turn these enterprises profitable very
quickly. This is a win-win for both Ukrainian and American taxpayers,”
he told VOA on Wednesday. </p>
<p>Hunder said the fund could unlock profits rapidly by introducing
professional management to Ukraine’s state-owned enterprises, which
currently face mismanagement issues. </p>
<p>“Ukraine has the second highest number of state-owned enterprises in
the world, many of which are being managed, or some are being
mismanaged, by the Ukrainian state. So, I think we get new professional
fund managers into these entities, and this is where you could seal
profits and turn them around very, very quickly,” he said.  </p>
<p>Hunder revealed that discussions about Ukrainian economic potential
were high on the agenda between the two countries in 2024, “[s]tarting
when Senator Lindsey Graham came in March and May of 2024, and we have
looked into this, and we see opportunity.”  </p>
<p>“To take advantage of this opportunity, the war must end, and this
deal, in his view, is a step toward a peaceful solution. I think this is
really what the new administration under President Trump is focusing on
— finding ways to stop the killing of Ukrainians by the Russians. We do
expect a ceasefire this year, in 2025, and now is the time when Ukraine
will present the biggest opportunity, the largest recovery, and the
reconstruction of a nation in Europe since World War II,” he said to
VOA. </p>
<p>Roman Opimakh, former general director of the Ukrainian Geological
Survey. agrees the deal could benefit both countries.</p>
<p>It will help the U.S. to diversify its rare metal supply and
“decrease dependence on China,” he said. For Ukraine, he said, the deal
could enable post-war re-industrialization and economic growth. We can
renew the industrial potential of our country and actually increase the
role of Ukraine globally,” Opimakh said by phone.  </p>
<p>While the deal indicates strong U.S. interest in Ukraine’s economic
future, security experts caution that it is not a comprehensive solution
to Ukraine’s security challenges. </p>
<p>Former defense minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk, now the chairman of the
Center for Defense Strategies in Ukraine, told VOA in a phone call the
deal has broader implications: “The U.S. framed this deal as a
demonstration of vested interest in Ukraine, signaling support for
Ukrainian stability. Investments of this scale serve as anchor
investments, potentially attracting more resources to Ukraine’s
economy.”  </p>
<p>Zagorodnyuk cautioned that economic ties are “not enough” to
guarantee Ukrainian sovereignty in the face of Russian aggression. To
deter future attacks, Ukraine needs military power — either on its own
or in partnership with NATO and European allies, he stated to
VOA.   </p>
<p>“We recognize that Russia might be attempting to manipulate the
situation and convey to Trump’s administration that even if they
continue their aggression for any reason, they would still respect
American interests or something like that,” he said.   </p>
<p>Asked by VOA what Ukraine needs from the U.S. for long-term security,
Zagorodnyuk said ideally, the country would have NATO. However, “if NATO
isn’t an option, there should be a package that enables Ukraine to
defend against aggression. This package must be robust, and that
strength needs to be clear to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,” he
said. </p>
<p>Agreement details  </p>
<p>According to VOA sources, who cannot be named because they are not
authorized to speak about the matter, negotiations concerning the
details of the deal continued right up to the Cabinet ministers’ meeting
late Wednesday afternoon, Kyiv time. </p>
<p>According to news reports, Ukraine negotiated more favorable terms
than the U.S. originally proposed, bringing down an initial U.S. demand
for a $500 billion claim on its natural resources.  </p>
<p>The deal does not include explicit U.S. security guarantees, which
Kyiv had originally sought. The U.S. will maintain decision-making
authority within the fund under its own legal framework, with ownership
terms to be defined in later agreements. </p>
<p>Geopolitical ramifications </p>
<p>Despite praising the agreement as a step toward strengthening
Ukraine’s economy, Trump sparked controversy recently by labeling
Zelenskyy a “dictator” without elections and pressuring him to finalize
the deal quickly. The U.S. administration has described the deal as a
way for the U.S. to recover tens of billions of dollars in military aid
sent to Ukraine.  </p>
<p>The question remains whether this economic partnership also can
foster lasting peace and stability in Ukraine.</p>

<h2 id="us-ukraine-to-sign-rare-earth-minerals-deal-trump-says-1">US,
Ukraine to sign rare earth minerals deal, Trump says</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he and Ukrainian President
Volodymyr Zelenskyy would sign a deal giving the United States
substantial rights to Kyiv’s lucrative rare earth minerals and
compensate Washington for weapons sent to Ukraine to fight Russia’s
three-year war of aggression.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy will be at the White House on Friday to sign the pact and
discuss the state of the war, Trump said at the first Cabinet meeting of
his new presidential term.</p>
<p>The deal “brings us great wealth,” Trump said, but his first goal is
to end the war, which has killed or wounded several hundred thousand
Russian and Ukrainian soldiers and Ukrainian civilians.</p>
<p>“My No. 2 thing is to get paid back,” Trump said of the more than
$100 billion in munitions Washington has shipped to Kyiv to support its
fighters. “Without our equipment, that [war] would have been over very
quickly,” with Russia overrunning Ukraine.</p>
<p>As it is, Russia now controls about a fifth of Ukraine’s
internationally recognized territory and has vowed to not give any of it
back in a would-be peace settlement.</p>
<p>Trump said he expected to eventually reach a deal with Zelenskyy and
Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the fighting. Trump initiated
talks with Putin about ending the conflict, but the first discussions
last week between the top U.S. and Russian diplomats, U.S. Secretary of
State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, excluded
Ukrainian and European officials.</p>
<p>“Because I got elected, this war is going to come to an end,” Trump
declared. He said Putin “had no intention of settling this. We’re going
to have a deal.”</p>
<p>Analysts said this deal was part of Zelenskyy’s original peace
formulation.</p>
<p>“So, it is difficult for the Ukrainian government to completely go
back on the offer,” said Olena Prokopenko, a senior fellow at the German
Marshall Fund and a former adviser to Ukraine’s finance minister.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, the draft deal offered to Ukraine in response to this
proposal was quite disappointing and quite one-sided. But now that the
arrangement seems to be much more balanced, the Ukrainian government is
ready to sign it,” she said.</p>
<p>Prokopenko said she expected some finessing before the deal was
signed.</p>
<p>“There’s some progress in terms of mentioning guarantees as a factor,
but it will have to be much more detailed in the final deal, because at
the moment there is no specific connection, basically, between security
and investments,” she said. “As of now, it looks like an investment
deal, but not as a security deal.”</p>
<p>Trump also said Wednesday that Ukraine “could forget about” joining
NATO, the West’s main military alliance, as part of a peace
settlement.</p>
<p>In Kyiv, Zelenskyy said at a news conference that the framework for
the rare earth mineral deal was complete, but that U.S. security
guarantees for Ukraine that the Kyiv government views as vital had yet
to be settled.</p>
<p>Trump has long expressed skepticism about continued U.S. military
support for Ukraine. Last year, he refused to say he wanted Ukraine to
win the war.</p>
<p>Trump has called Zelenskyy a dictator and falsely accused Ukraine of
having started the war with Russia.</p>
<p>The U.S. leader has said he is particularly peeved that former
President Joe Biden agreed to the Ukraine military assistance without
any provision that Ukraine would pay back the cost. Biden led the
coalition of Western allies in providing the military aid as a way to
fight Russian aggression without sending their own troops to fight
alongside Ukrainian forces.</p>
<p>The U.S. military aid was a grant and not a loan that needed to be
repaid, Zelenskyy said, but now he has agreed to the deal for the rare
earth minerals needed for manufacturing technology products.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy said he expected to have wide-ranging, substantive
discussions with Trump.</p>
<p>“I want to coordinate with the U.S.,” Zelenskyy said.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian leader said he wanted to know whether the U.S. planned
to halt military aid and, if so, whether Ukraine would be able to
purchase weapons directly from the U.S. He said he also wanted to know
whether Ukraine could use frozen Russian assets for weapons investments
and whether Washington planned to lift its economic sanctions on Russian
entities and high-level associates and friends of Putin.</p>
<p>Earlier, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal told the country’s
public television channel that the agreement set out terms and
conditions of an investment fund for the rebuilding of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Under terms of the deal, 50% of proceeds from Ukraine’s minerals, oil
and gas would go toward creating a “stable and economically prosperous
Ukraine” if the war is ended, and half would go to a U.S.-controlled
fund.</p>
<p>The economic agreement, seen by The Associated Press, includes a line
that says the U.S. “supports Ukraine’s effort to obtain security
guarantees needed to establish lasting peace” but does not spell out
what that might entail.</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is meeting with Trump on Thursday
in Washington to spell out a European initiative for a 30,000-person
peacekeeping force to enforce a Russian ceasefire with Ukraine if such a
truce can be reached, although no peace talks have been scheduled.</p>
<p>European leaders have said a peacekeeping force would require an
American “backstop” of military assistance, such as American satellite
surveillance or air support.</p>
<p>Trump has not committed the U.S. to such a plan but on Wednesday
called the peacekeeping force “a good thing.”</p>

Agence France-Presse and Reuters.</p>

id="new-app-lets-homebuyers-know-about-future-neighbors-politics">New
app lets homebuyers know about future neighbor’s politics</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Most homebuyers get to know the people who live next door after they
move in. But a new real estate app allows future homebuyers to learn a
potential neighbor’s political leanings before they make what, for many
people, is the biggest purchase of their life.</p>
<p>“The purpose of Oyssey [the app] is to democratize data for buyers in
their home search experience … to get you, as a prospective buyer, a
feel for the area and community,” says Darian Kelly, co-founder of
Oyssey. “It’s to get you to the understanding of, when I move here,
these are the type of people that I might be inviting over for dinner.
The type of people that I will be raising my child alongside.”</p>
<p>The Oyssey data is pulled from sources like election results,
campaign contributions and information from marketing research
firms.</p>
<p>The app has only launched in Florida and New York so far, but its
founders say they expect to take it nationwide later this year. Realtors
subscribe to Oyssey and then give their homebuyer clients access to the
service.</p>
<p>For the initial launch, the platform breaks down political
affiliation block by block, but Kelly says potential homebuyers will
eventually be able to look up whether their prospective new neighbor is
a registered Democrat or Republican.</p>
<p>Ben McCartney, an assistant professor of commerce at the University
of Virginia, co-authored a study published in 2024 that found that 1 of
every 100 moves is politically motivated, and that the people most
likely to relocate for this reason tend to be less involved in
politics.</p>
<p>“They don’t want politics to be part of their everyday life, but then
they get a new neighbor, and that new neighbor is not only very
politically vocal, but also affiliated with the opposite party, and
there’s where we see the strongest tensions arise,” McCartney says.</p>
<p>The study found that current residents are slightly more likely to
move away if they get new neighbors with different political views than
if the new neighbor is affiliated with the same political party.</p>
<p>“So, political polarization isn’t just a social media phenomenon but
is affecting real economic decisions, as well,” McCartney says.</p>
<p>The study found the numbers of Democrats and Republicans who wanted
to move away from neighbors with different political views to be roughly
even. That’s why an app like Oyssey makes sense to McCartney.</p>
<p>“People do seem to care about the political identities of their new
neighbors, so I’m not surprised that some company is now selling that
information, or providing that information, to would-be buyers,” he
says. “And I tend to be supportive of policies that make it easier for
people to make informed decisions.”</p>
<p>The Oyssey platform also provides other data relating to quality of
life for the individual homebuyer, such as where to find the most dog
parks.</p>
<p>“Where is the area with the most registered dogs throughout their
state or county?” Kelly says. “And we can try to get an idea and figure
out where do the dogs live, because as a pet owner, that’s where I want
to be.”</p>
<p>He dismisses any suggestion that Oyssey could contribute to deepening
America’s political divide.</p>
<p>“I actually get upset by the question. … I think the question makes
the assumption that you shouldn’t be the driver, you shouldn’t be the
writer of your own story,” Kelly says.</p>
<p>“We believe that we’re giving people the data and the information to
control their own destiny and do what they will with that information.
The data already exists.”</p>
<p>Oyssey’s stated goal is to make that public information easier to
find.</p>

<p>Ukrainian officials said Wednesday that Russian aerial attacks in the
Kyiv and Donetsk regions killed at least seven people.   </p>
<p>Donetsk Governor Vadym Filashkin said on Telegram that preliminary

<p>The United States and Ukraine have a framework deal in place for a

according to officials familiar with the negotiations.</p>
<p>The plan would include investing 50% of proceeds from Ukraine’s

id="nominee-for-no.-2-spot-at-pentagon-warns-china-incredibly-determined-to-surpass-us">Nominee
for No. 2 spot at Pentagon warns China ‘incredibly determined’ to
surpass US</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PENTAGON — President Donald Trump’s nominee for deputy secretary of
defense is warning that China’s military is resolute on surpassing the
United States and is calling for a fix to “significant” military
shortages at a time when administration leaders are trying to make big
budget cuts.</p>
<p>“China is incredibly determined, they feel a great sense of urgency,
and they’ll be fully dedicated to becoming the strongest nation in the
world and having dominance over the United States,” Steve Feinberg told
members of the Senate Armed Service Committee on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Feinberg, a businessman and investor, said the U.S. military
shortages include “shipbuilding, nuclear modernization, aircraft
development, cyber defense, hypersonics, counter space, defending our
satellites [and] counter drones.”</p>
<p>“We really need to plug these shortages, focus on our priorities, get
rid of legacy programs, be very disciplined, while at the same time
focusing on the economics. If we do that, given America’s great
innovative capability, entrepreneurship, we will defeat China. If we
don’t, our very national security is at risk,” Feinberg said.</p>
<p>The hearing comes as Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has called on
the department to cut 8% — roughly $50 billion — to reinvest in
priorities aligned with a “more lethal fighting force.”</p>
<p>Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services
Committee, on Tuesday pushed back against the move saying, “Slashing the
defense budget will not create efficiency in our military. It will
cripple it.”</p>
<p>The concern about cuts to the military has echoed on both sides of
the aisle.</p>
<p>Republican committee Chairman Roger Wicker told the Breaking Defense
news organization last month that he hoped to increase defense spending
by as much as $200 billion in coming years.</p>
<p>And Republican Senator Dan Sullivan on Tuesday called for
prioritizing solutions to shipbuilding to counter threats from China and
others.</p>
<p>“We’re in the worst crisis in shipbuilding in over 40 years. The
Chinese are building a giant navy. It’s already bigger than ours,” he
said.</p>
<p>China’s military has about 370 warships, according to the Pentagon’s
latest China Military Power Report, while the U.S. military has about
300.</p>
<p>Feinberg acknowledged that the shipbuilding shortage is “a tough
problem” for the military.</p>
<p>“Our supply chain is definitely weak. Our workforce needs to be
improved. But a big piece of improving our supply chain is working more
closely with our private sector. We have companies that can get at where
our needs are, where our shortages are, and we need to work more closely
with them. We need people inside of government that understand their
issues,” Feinberg said.</p>
<p>Several Democrats on the committee were critical of interference at
the Pentagon by the Department of Government Efficiency, saying it could
create a major vulnerability should its members not handle data more
carefully.</p>
<p>“They [DOGE] just sent an unclassified email with CIA recent hire
names in an unclassified space. As a former CIA officer, you just blew
the cover of someone who was going to risk their life abroad to protect
our country,” said Democratic Senator Elissa Slotkin.</p>
<p>“Do you know how appetizing it is for our adversaries to have this
data? … It is quite literally an issue of safety and security,” she
added.</p>
<p>Democrats also raised concern about plans to let go more than 5,000
Pentagon civilian employees this week, while Republican Senator
Markwayne Mullin countered that cutting 5,000 jobs amounted to less than
0.5% of the workforce.</p>
<p>“Our national debt is now costing us more to just pay interest than
we spend on our military. That’s a huge national security risk,” he
said. “And so, at what point do we start making cuts?”</p>

id="ukraine-us-agree-on-a-framework-economic-deal-ukrainian-officials-say">Ukraine,
US agree on a framework economic deal, Ukrainian officials say</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>KYIV, UKRAINE — Ukraine and the United States have reached an
agreement on a framework for a broad economic deal that would include
access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals, three senior Ukrainian
officials said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The officials, who were familiar with the matter, spoke on condition
of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. One of
them said Kyiv hopes that signing the agreement will ensure the
continued flow of U.S. military support that Ukraine urgently needs.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office,
said he’d heard that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was coming
and added that “it’s OK with me, if he’d like to, and he would like to
sign it together with me.”</p>
<p>The agreement could be signed as early as Friday and plans are being
drawn up for Zelenskyy to travel to Washington to meet Trump, according
to one of the Ukrainian officials.</p>
<p>Another official said the agreement would provide an opportunity for
Zelenskyy and Trump to discuss continued military aid to Ukraine, which
is why Kyiv is eager to finalize the deal.</p>
<p>Trump called it “a very big deal,” adding that it could be worth 1
trillion dollars. “It could be whatever, but it’s rare earths and other
things.”</p>
<p>According to one Ukrainian official, some technical details are still
to be worked out. However, the draft does not include a contentious
Trump administration proposal to give the U.S. $500 billion worth of
profits from Ukraine’s rare earth minerals as compensation for its
wartime assistance to Kyiv.</p>
<p>Instead, the U.S. and Ukraine would have joint ownership of a fund,
and Ukraine would in the future contribute 50% of future proceeds from
state-owned resources, including minerals, oil, and gas. One official
said the deal had better terms of investments and another one said that
Kyiv secured favorable amendments and viewed the outcome as
“positive.”</p>
<p>The deal does not, however, include security guarantees. One official
said that this would be something the two presidents would discuss when
they meet.</p>
<p>The progress in negotiating the deal comes after Trump and Zelenskyy
traded sharp rhetoric last week about their differences over the
matter.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy said he balked at signing off on a deal that U.S. Treasury
Secretary Scott Bessent pushed during a visit to Kyiv earlier this
month, and the Ukrainian leader objected again days later during a
meeting in Munich with Vice President JD Vance because the American
proposal did not include security guarantees.</p>
<p>Trump then called Volodymyr Zelenskyy “a dictator without elections”
and claimed his support among voters was near rock-bottom.</p>
<p>But the two sides made significant progress during a three-day visit
to Ukraine last week by retired Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg,
Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia.</p>
<p>The idea was initially proposed last fall by Zelenskyy as part of his
plan to strengthen Kyiv’s hand in future negotiations with Moscow.</p>

<h2 id="trump-examines-chinas-copper-production">Trump examines China’s
copper production</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WHITE HOUSE — China’s growing copper reserves have caught the eye of
President Donald Trump, who on Tuesday ordered an investigation into
what administration officials say is Beijing’s move to “gain control of
the world’s copper markets.”</p>
<p>Trump, in the Oval Office, asked his newly minted secretary of
commerce, Howard Lutnick, to explain. Lutnick read from what he said was
a social media post he planned to release, saying: “Tariffs will help
rebuild back our American copper industry and strengthen our national
defense. American industries depend on copper, and they should be made
in America. No exemptions, no exceptions. America first creates American
jobs and protects our national security. It’s time for copper to come
home.”</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Trump’s senior counselor for trade and
manufacturing explained the administration’s concerns.</p>
<p>“China has long used industrial overcapacity and dumping as an
economic weapon to dominate global markets, systematically undercutting
competitors and driving rival industries out of business by massively
subsidizing key industries, flooding international markets with
below-cost goods and then consolidating control once competitors
collapse,” Peter Navarro said in a call with reporters ahead of the
signing. “China has successfully expanded its economic influence in
sectors ranging from steel and aluminum to solar panels and electric
vehicles.”</p>
<p>Trump’s order jumpstarts an investigation under the authority of the
Trade Expansion Act, which focuses on whether importation of a certain
item presents a threat to national security. The president can decide
whether to follow the recommendations of the report, due in 270
days.</p>
<p>China’s government released a report earlier this month where they
laid out a plan to increase copper ore reserves by 5% to 10% by
2027.</p>
<p>Chinese government figures state that in 2024, China topped the world
in the production of both refined copper and copper-processed
materials.</p>
<p>Navarro told reporters the U.S. hopes to do more with the nation’s
“untapped” copper potential and cited plans to boost U.S. production by
70% and reduce external reliance on the material vital for electrical
equipment.</p>

id="apple-shareholders-reject-proposal-to-scrap-companys-diversity-programs">Apple
shareholders reject proposal to scrap company’s diversity programs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Apple shareholders rebuffed an attempt to pressure the technology
trendsetter into joining President Donald Trump’s push to scrub
corporate programs designed to diversify its workforce. </p>
<p>The proposal drafted by the National Center for Public Policy
Research — a self-described conservative think tank — urged Apple to
follow a litany of high-profile companies that have retreated from
diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives currently in the Trump
administration’s crosshairs. </p>
<p>After a brief presentation about the anti-DEI proposal, Apple
announced shareholders had rejected it. In a regulatory filing submitted
Tuesday evening, Apple disclosed that 97% of the ballots cast were votes
against the measure. </p>
<p>The outcome vindicated Apple management’s decision to stand behind
its diversity commitment even though Trump asked the U.S. Department of
Justice to look into whether these types of programs have discriminated
against some employees whose race or gender aren’t aligned with the
initiative’s goals. </p>
<p>But Apple CEO Tim Cook has maintained a cordial relationship with
Trump since his first term in office, an alliance that so far has helped
the company skirt tariffs on its iPhones made in China. After Cook and
Trump met last week, Apple on Monday announced it will invest $500
billion in the U.S. and create 20,000 more jobs during the next four
years — a commitment applauded by the president. </p>
<p>Tuesday’s shareholder vote came a month after the same group
presented a similar proposal during Costco’s annual meeting, only to
have it overwhelmingly rejected, too. </p>
<p>That snub didn’t discourage the National Center for Public Policy
Research from confronting Apple about its DEI program in a pre-recorded
presentation by Stefan Padfield, executive director of the think tank’s
Free Enterprise Project, who asserted “forced diversity is bad for
business.” </p>
<p>In the presentation, Padfield attacked Apple’s diversity commitments
for being out of line with recent court rulings and said the programs
expose the Cupertino, California, company to an onslaught of potential
lawsuits for alleged discrimination. He cited the Trump administration
as one of Apple’s potential legal adversaries. </p>
<p>“The vibe shift is clear: DEI is out, and merit is in,” Padfield said
in the presentation. </p>
<p>The specter of potential legal trouble was magnified last week when
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier filed a federal lawsuit against
Target alleging the retailer’s recently scaled-back DEI program
alienated many consumers and undercut sales to the detriment of
shareholders. </p>
<p>Just as Costco does, Apple contends that fostering a diverse
workforce makes good business sense. </p>
<p>But Cook conceded Apple may have to make some adjustments to its
diversity program “as the legal landscape changes” while still striving
to maintain a culture that has helped elevate the company to its current
market value of $3.7 trillion — greater than any other business in the
world. </p>
<p>“We will continue to create a culture of belonging,” Cook told
shareholders during the meeting. </p>
<p>In its last diversity and inclusion report issued in 2022, Apple
disclosed that nearly three-fourths of its global workforce consisted of
white and Asian employees. Nearly two-thirds of its employees were
men. </p>
<p>Other major technology companies for years have reported employing
mostly white and Asian men, especially in high-paid engineering jobs — a
tendency that spurred the industry to pursue largely unsuccessful
efforts to diversify.</p>

chief tours Guantanamo Bay as more detainees arrive</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — More migrants slated for deportation from the United
States arrived Tuesday at the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,
under the watchful eye of U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. </p>
<p>Hegseth, visiting the U.S. naval base to get briefings on the
military’s efforts to support Washington’s mass deportation efforts,
posted on social media that he witnessed the U.S. cargo jet land, adding
he is proud to partner with the U.S. agencies working to “remove those
who have infringed on our territorial sovereignty.” </p>
<p>Two U.S. defense officials told VOA that the C-130 carrying nine
migrants from Fort Bliss in Texas landed at Guantanamo Bay midday
Tuesday, and that all nine are considered “high threat illegal
aliens.”</p>
<p>One of the officials said they were taken from the plane to the
detention center, where they were being held under guard. </p>
<p>A third official told VOA that an additional flight carrying more
migrants was tentatively scheduled for Wednesday. </p>
<p>All of the officials spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity since
they were not authorized to discuss the deportation operations.  </p>
<p>The new detainees join another 17 detainees sent from Fort Bliss to
Guantanamo Bay on Sunday.</p>
<p>Neither the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which is
spearheading the U.S. deportation efforts, nor Immigration and Customs
Enforcement (ICE) has so far responded to questions about the identities
of the detainees, their countries of origin or the crimes with which
they are charged.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s flight carrying detainees from the U.S. mainland to the
naval base in Cuba is the second since ICE last Thursday deported 177
detainees who had been brought to Guantanamo Bay earlier this month.</p>
<p>Of the 177, officials had said that more than 120 were dangerous
criminals, including members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan street gang
designated by the U.S. as a foreign terrorist organization.</p>
<p>The other 50 or so individuals had been held at the base’s migrant
operations center, designed to hold nonviolent individuals.   </p>
<p>Hegseth on Tuesday shared photos of his visit to the base on his X
social media account, where he toured both the detention center and the
migrant operations center.  </p>
<p>“These warriors are directly supporting the apprehension and
deportation of dangerous illegal aliens,” he wrote in one post. “We
cannot thank them or their families enough.”</p>
<p>The Pentagon’s deputy press secretary, Kingsley Wilson, also posted
about the visit on her X account, sharing video of the facilities
designed to house “low-priority &amp; medium-priority illegal aliens”
before they are ultimately deported. </p>
<p>The commander of U.S. Southern Command, which oversees operations at
the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, told lawmakers earlier this month that
the base’s migrant facility had the capacity to hold about 2,500
nonviolent detainees. Efforts were underway to allow it to house as many
as 30,000 nonviolent migrants slated for deportation.</p>
<p>U.S. deportation efforts have sparked criticism from immigration
rights groups.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the American Civil Liberties Union and several
other organizations filed a lawsuit against DHS, alleging the detainees
held at the Guantanamo Bay prison facility before being deported
Thursday had been improperly denied access to lawyers.</p>
<p>DHS dismissed the lawsuit’s allegations.</p>

id="house-speaker-secures-enough-republican-votes-to-pass-budget">House
speaker secures enough Republican votes to pass budget</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson secured enough
votes, 217-215, to pass a budget resolution on Tuesday night, advancing
a Republican effort to extend tax breaks and cut spending that Democrats
called “reckless.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We have a lot of hard work ahead of us, but we are going to deliver
the America First agenda,” Johnson told reporters.  “We’re going to
deliver all of it, not just parts of it, and this is the first step in
that process.”</p>
<p>Johnson and other House Republican leaders said in a statement their
goal is a bill “that secures our border, keeps taxes low for families
and job creators, restores American energy dominance, strengthens
America’s standing on the world stage, and makes government work more
effectively for all Americans.”</p>
<p>House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Republicans are working
to “slash and burn” programs such as veterans’ benefits, food
assistance, and health care for lower-income people.</p>
<p>“The reckless Republican budget will cut taxes up to $4.5 trillion
for the wealthy, the well-off and the well-connected, and then they are
sticking working-class Americans, middle-class Americans and everyday
Americans with the bill,” Jeffries told reporters.</p>
<p>Before the vote, several members of the House Republican conference
were still concerned about the size of the spending measure, how and
when to enact a proposed extension of the 2017 tax cuts, and how to pay
down the U.S. deficit without cutting key safety net programs that help
American voters. Senate leadership has proposed passing the tax cuts in
a separate bill later this year.</p>
<p>“Not only are we working to find savings for the American taxpayer, a
better, more efficient use of their dollar, which we are morally
obligated to do, we also have a moral obligation to bend the curve on
the debt,” Johnson said.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump has called for lawmakers to pass “one big,
beautiful bill” that will be a key part of enacting his domestic policy
agenda.</p>
<p>Despite Trump expressing his preference for the House of
Representatives version of the budget, the Senate passed a funding
resolution Friday that provides $150 billion in military funding and
$175 billion for border security. That measure also avoids the
controversial Medicaid cuts of the House version.</p>
<p>Republican Representative Tony Gonzales led a group of seven House
Republicans warning against potential cuts to health care program
Medicaid, food assistance funding and other social safety net
programs.</p>
<p>“Slashing Medicaid would have serious consequences, particularly in
rural and predominantly Hispanic communities where hospitals and nursing
homes are already struggling to keep their doors open,” the lawmakers
said in a letter to Johnson last week.</p>
<p>Trump posted on Truth Social last week that “The House and Senate are
doing a SPECTACULAR job of working together as one unified, and
unbeatable, TEAM, however, unlike the Lindsey Graham version of the very
important Legislation currently being discussed, the House Resolution
implements my FULL America First Agenda, EVERYTHING, not just parts of
it!”</p>
<p>The House and Senate bills will now have to be compromised to be
signed into law.</p>
<p>If lawmakers cannot reach a compromise by March 14, there will be a
partial government shutdown, leaving millions of federal employees
temporarily without pay and suspending some nonessential government
services.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune did not rule out the possibility of
another short-term spending bill to give lawmakers more time to
work.</p>
<p>“We’re keeping all the options on the table, but we are running out
of time,” Thune told reporters Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Senate moved forward with a vote on its version of the budget due
to uncertainty over the potential success of the vote on the House
version.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer characterized the vote as a
first step toward hurting voters.</p>
<p>“Make no mistake, it will rob seniors, kids and the disabled to pay
for the rich to get richer. It’s wrong. We’re going to use every lever
we have at our disposal to lift up the concerns that we are hearing from
our constituents, band together and organize with them and fight to stop
this tax break for billionaires,” Schumer told reporters Tuesday.</p>

<h2 id="us-consumer-confidence-drops-sharply-survey-shows">US consumer
confidence drops sharply, survey shows</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. consumer confidence plunged in February in its biggest monthly
decline in more than four years, a business research group said
Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index dropped from
105.3 in January to 98.3 this month, the largest month-to-month decline
since August 2021.</p>
<p>With U.S. consumer spending accounting for about 70% of the world’s
largest economy, the three major stock indexes on Wall Street all fell
on news of the report. The tech-heavy NASDAQ dropped by more than a
percentage point.</p>
<p>The Conference Board said in a statement, “Views of current labor
market conditions weakened. Consumers became pessimistic about future
business conditions and less optimistic about future income. Pessimism
about future employment prospects worsened and reached a 10-month
high.”</p>
<p>Separately, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent contended Tuesday
that the U.S. economy is more fragile under the surface than economic
indicators suggest, and he vowed to “reprivatize” growth by cutting
government spending and regulation.</p>
<p>In his first major economic policy address, Bessent told a group at
the Australian Embassy in Washington that interest rate volatility,
enduring inflation and reliance on the public sector for job growth have
hobbled the American economy, despite general national economic growth
and low unemployment.</p>
<p>Bessent blamed “prolific overspending” under former President Joe
Biden and regulations that have hindered supply-side growth as the main
drivers of “sticky inflation.”</p>
<p>“The previous administration’s over-reliance on excessive government
spending and overbearing regulation left us with an economy that may
have exhibited some reasonable metrics but ultimately was brittle
underneath,” he said.</p>
<p>Bessent said that 95% of all job growth in the past 12 months has
been concentrated in public and government-adjacent sectors, such as
health care and education, jobs offering slower wage growth and less
productivity than private-sector jobs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he said jobs in manufacturing, metals, mining and
information technology all contracted or flatlined over the same
period.</p>
<p>“The private sector has been in recession,” Bessent said. “Our goal
is to reprivatize the economy.”</p>
<p>Consumers had appeared increasingly confident heading toward the end
of 2024 and spent generously during the holiday season. But U.S. retail
sales dropped sharply in January, with unusually cold weather throughout
much of the U.S. taking some of the blame.</p>
<p>Retail sales fell 0.9% last month from December, the Commerce
Department reported last week. The decline, the biggest in a year, came
after two months of robust gains.</p>
<p>With inflation remaining a concern for consumers and uncertainty
about President Donald Trump’s plan to impose new or stiffer tariffs on
imports from other countries, policymakers at the country’s central
bank, the Federal Reserve, have taken a cautious approach on whether to
further cut its benchmark interest rate.</p>
<p>The Fed left its key borrowing rate alone at its last meeting after
cutting it at the previous three.</p>
<p>“Consumers’ confidence has deteriorated sharply in the face of
threats to impose large tariffs and to slash federal spending and
employment,” Pantheon Macroeconomics chief Samuel Tombs wrote in a note
to clients.</p>
<p>Some information in this report came from The Associated Press,
Reuters and Agence France-Presse.</p>

expands visa restrictions on Cubans tied to labor export program</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States has expanded an existing visa
restriction policy to target Cuban officials believed to be tied to a
labor program that sends Cuban workers overseas, particularly health
care workers, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In a statement, Rubio said the expanded restrictions target
individuals and immediate family members of individuals believed to be
responsible for the program, which he described as “forced labor.” The
U.S. has already imposed restrictions on several people, including some
Venezuelans, he added.</p>
<p>The Caribbean island nation’s health service generates major export
earnings by sending health workers around the world.</p>
<p>“Cuba’s labor export programs, which include the medical missions,
enrich the Cuban regime, and in the case of Cuba’s overseas medical
missions, deprive ordinary Cubans of the medical care they desperately
need in their home country,” Rubio said.</p>
<p>The Cuban government did not immediately respond to a request for
comment.</p>
<p>The United States and Cuba have had a strained relationship since
Fidel Castro took over in a 1959 revolution, and a U.S. trade embargo
has been in place for decades.</p>

Supreme Court throws out Oklahoma man’s murder conviction, death
sentence</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday threw out the murder
conviction and death penalty for Richard Glossip, an Oklahoma man who
has steadfastly maintained his innocence and averted multiple attempts
by the state to execute him.</p>
<p>The justices found that Glossip’s trial violated his constitutional
rights.</p>
<p>The justices heard arguments in October in a case that produced a
rare alliance in which lawyers for Glossip and the state argued that the
high court should overturn Glossip’s conviction and death sentence
because he did not get a fair trial.</p>
<p>The victim’s relatives had told the high court that they want to see
Glossip executed.</p>
<p>Oklahoma’s top criminal appeals court had repeatedly upheld the
conviction and sentence, even after the state sided with Glossip.</p>
<p>Glossip was convicted and sentenced to death in the 1997 killing in
Oklahoma City of his former boss, motel owner Barry Van Treese, in what
prosecutors have alleged was a murder-for-hire scheme.</p>
<p>Glossip has always maintained his innocence. Another man, Justin
Sneed, admitted robbing Van Treese and beating him to death with a
baseball bat but testified he only did so after Glossip promised to pay
him $10,000. Sneed received a life sentence in exchange for his
testimony and was the key witness against Glossip.</p>

<p>U.S. President Donald Trump plans to send 30,000 undocumented
migrants to Guantanamo Bay, the U.S. naval base in Cuba. While it is
most well known for housing terror suspects after 9/11 — and for drawing
condemnation from human rights groups — Guantanamo has been occasionally
used as a processing center for immigrants trying to reach the U.S.,
mostly from Haiti and Cuba. Although Guantanamo’s Migrant Operations
Center is separate from the high-security jail, that doesn’t mean it has
escaped scrutiny.</p>

<h2 id="us-again-sends-high-threat-migrants-to-guantanamo-bay">US again
sends ‘high threat’ migrants to Guantanamo Bay</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The United States has started sending more migrants
deemed by officials to be “high threat” criminal aliens to the U.S.
naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, just days after emptying out the
base’s migrant facilities.</p>
<p>A U.S. defense official confirmed to VOA that a C-130 military cargo
plane carrying migrants left Fort Bliss in Texas and arrived at
Guantanamo Bay on Sunday.</p>
<p>A second defense official said all 17 migrants were assessed to be
“high threat” and are being held at the base’s detention facility.</p>
<p>Both officials spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity to discuss
the deportation operations.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which is spearheading the
U.S. deportation efforts, along with Immigration and Customs Enforcement
(ICE), has not yet responded to questions about the identities of the
latest round of detainees sent to Guantanamo Bay, their countries of
origin, or the crimes with which they are charged.</p>
<p>The latest flight carrying migrants to Guantanamo Bay comes as U.S.
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is set to visit the base Tuesday to
review the military’s efforts to support the mass deportations ordered
by U.S. President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Hegseth, according to a Pentagon statement, “will receive briefings
on all mission operations at the base, including at the Migrant
Operations Center and the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility.”</p>
<p>“The Secretary’s trip underscores the Department’s commitment to
ensuring the security and operational effectiveness of Guantanamo Bay
Naval Station,” the statement added.</p>
<p>ICE announced last Thursday that it had transported 177 migrants
being held at Guantanamo Bay to Honduras, where they were to be picked
up by the Venezuelan government.</p>
<p>U.S. officials had previously said that more than 120 of those
detainees were dangerous criminals, including members of Tren de Aragua,
a Venezuelan street gang designated by the U.S. as a foreign terrorist
organization.</p>
<p>The approximately 50 other individuals who were deported Thursday had
been held at the base’s migrant facility, designed to hold nonviolent
individuals.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the commander of U.S. Southern Command, which
oversees operations at the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, told lawmakers
that the base’s migrant facility had the capacity to hold about 2,500
nonviolent detainees. Efforts are under way to allow it to house as many
as 30,000 nonviolent migrants slated for deportation.</p>
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union, along with several immigration
rights groups, earlier this month filed a lawsuit against DHS, alleging
the detainees held at the Guantanamo Bay prison facility before being
deported had been improperly denied access to lawyers.</p>
<p>DHS dismissed the lawsuit’s allegations.</p>

id="trump-administration-proposes-steep-fees-on-chinese-cargo-ships">Trump
administration proposes steep fees on Chinese cargo ships</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Trump administration has proposed punitive new fees on
international shipping that would target vessels owned by Chinese
companies or manufactured in Chinese shipyards, promising to
dramatically alter the economics of global trade.</p>
<p>The new policy would charge Chinese-owned cargo ships, as well as
third-country flagged vessels built in China, $1 million or more per
port-of-call in the U.S.</p>
<p>Large container ships often make multiple stops when delivering goods
to the U.S., and would face new fees at each port.</p>
<p>The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) published the
proposal Friday, tying it to an investigation into allegations by
several U.S. labor unions that China has unfairly distorted the
international shipbuilding industry.</p>
<p>The investigation, conducted under Section 301 of the Trade Act of
1974, determined that the Chinese government has pursued a policy of
subsidizing its domestic shipbuilding industry with the aim of
“targeting for dominance” the global market.</p>
<p>Growing market share</p>
<p>The investigation pointed out that over the past 25 years, China’s
share of the global shipbuilding industry has exploded. China accounted
for about 5% of the total tonnage of ships manufactured in 1999. By
2023, the Chinese share of the market surpassed 50%.</p>
<p>The USTR found that Chinese policy “burdens or restricts U.S.
commerce by undercutting business opportunities for and investments in
the U.S. maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors; restricting
competition and choice; creating economic security risks from dependence
and vulnerabilities in sectors critical to the functioning of the U.S.
economy; and undermining supply chain resilience.”</p>
<p>The results of the investigation, which began during President Joe
Biden’s administration, were announced last month.</p>
<p>The proposal is open for public comment until March 24, at which
point the administration will determine whether or not to implement
it.</p>
<p>Chinese reaction</p>
<p>On Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian sharply
criticized the U.S. move.</p>
<p>“[T]o serve its political agenda at home, the U.S. has abused Section
301 investigation[s], which seriously violated WTO [World Trade
Organization] rules and further undermined the multilateral trading
system,” he said. “We call on the U.S. side to respect facts and
multilateral rules and immediately stop its wrongdoings.”</p>
<p>The China Association of the National Shipbuilding Industry (CANSI)
and China Shipowner Association had previously blasted the USTR
investigation as being “conclusions full of lies and distortion of
facts.”</p>
<p>In a statement issued when the results of the investigation were
released, CANSI said, “Development of China’s shipbuilding industry
strictly follows the international trading rules and is the result of
collaboration with global partners, as well as the tech innovation, and
the hard-wording and excellent performances of Chinese industry
players.”</p>
<p>Complex new rules</p>
<p>The USTR proposal contains a number of complicated elements that made
it unclear precisely how any new regime of port fees would be
administered.</p>
<p>Each ship owned by a Chinese entity would be charged a $1 million fee
on entering a U.S. port, though the proposal also appears to consider a
different fee calculation of $1,000 per ton of capacity, which could add
up to considerably more for large ships that carry thousands of tons of
cargo.</p>
<p>Chinese-built ships operated by non-Chinese shipowners would be
subject to a $1.5 million fee, which could be adjusted, depending on the
percentage of Chinese-built ships in that shipowner’s fleet. This would
apply even if the ship’s cargo was not manufactured in China.</p>
<p>Ships owned by companies that have existing orders for new ships
pending with Chinese shipbuilders could be hit with an additional $1
million fee per entry at U.S. ports.</p>
<p>The rule also provides for “refunds” of a similar amount each time a
shipping company sends a U.S.-built cargo ship into a U.S. port.</p>
<p>Economic justifications hazy</p>
<p>Mary Lovely, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for
International Economics, said it was difficult to find an economic
justification for the proposal.</p>
<p>“The thing that’s really disturbing is that it’s not linked to any
particular policy that would benefit American businesses or consumers,”
she said.</p>
<p>International trade will continue to flow to the United States, but
through more convoluted routes that add time and expense. For example,
Lovely predicted that many shipping firms would explore the possibility
of diverting their ships to ports in Mexico and Canada, and trucking the
cargo into the U.S.</p>
<p>“It seems to me that this is just a tremendous way to reduce volume
and employment at U.S. ports and basically force trade to take
transportation routes and transportation modes that are clearly going to
raise prices for U.S. businesses and consumers,” Lovely said. “There’s
no way around it.”</p>
<p>In an email exchange with VOA, Joe Kramek, World Shipping Council
president and CEO, echoed those concerns.</p>
<p>“USTR’s proposed draconian $1 million-plus per U.S. port visit fees
on ships that carry the large majority of the U.S. trade, if they are
Chinese-built or –operated – or on any ship operator from any country
that has even a single Chinese ship in its fleet or on order – if
carried forward, would cause broad economic harm across all sectors of
the U.S. supply chain,” wrote Kramek, whose organization represents
shipping companies.</p>
<p>“The fees would result in fewer U.S. port calls, higher prices for
U.S. consumers, and severe impacts for exporters, particularly American
farmers,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Unlikely to benefit US shipbuilders</p>
<p>Though ostensibly aimed at helping U.S. shipbuilders, the law is
unlikely to have a significant impact on that industry, said Marc
Levinson, a Washington-based economist and historian who has written two
books about container shipping.</p>
<p>“This is not likely to do much for U.S. shipbuilding,” Levinson told
VOA. “U.S. commercial shipbuilders are very far away from global scale.
They don’t produce anything that is competitive on the international
market for commercial oceangoing vessels.”</p>
<p>“The winners of this policy would be Japan, Korea, the Philippines,
other countries where commercial shipbuilding is on a larger scale today
than the United States,” Levinson said. The losers, he added, will
include U.S. consumers, as the port fees are passed on in the form of
higher prices for imported goods.</p>
<p>In an email exchange with VOA, the National Retail Federation
registered its opposition to the policy, writing, “NRF strongly opposes
a port fee remedy, which will do nothing to force China to change its
behavior and practices. It will only increase shipping costs for
retailers and further disrupt the maritime market.”</p>

<h2
id="trump-says-canada-mexico-tariffs-on-schedule-despite-border-fentanyl-efforts">Trump
says Canada, Mexico tariffs on schedule despite border, fentanyl
efforts</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said on Monday that tariffs on
Canadian and Mexican imports are “on time and on schedule” despite
efforts by the countries to beef up border security and halt the flow of
fentanyl into the U.S. ahead of a March 4 deadline.</p>
<p>“The tariffs are going forward on time, on schedule,” Trump told a
joint news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron. He had been
asked whether Canada and Mexico had done enough to avoid the punishing
25% U.S. duties.</p>
<p>Many had hoped the top two U.S. trading partners could persuade
Trump’s administration to further delay tariffs that would apply to over
$918 billion worth of U.S. imports from the two countries, from autos to
energy. This could wreak havoc on the integrated North American economy,
with the automotive sector hit particularly hard.</p>
<p>Trump did not specifically mention the March 4 deadline. He later
referred to his desire for “reciprocal” tariffs to match the duty rates
and offset the trade barriers of all countries, including France.</p>
<p>Trump and Macron did not publicly discuss another sticking point –
digital services taxes imposed by France, Canada and other countries
aimed at dominant U.S. tech giants including Google, Facebook and
Amazon.</p>
<p>On Friday, Trump ordered his administration to revive tariff
investigations into countries that levy digital service taxes on U.S.
firms.</p>
<p>Border hopes dimmed</p>
<p>Canada and Mexico have taken steps to beef up border security, which
bought them about a month’s reprieve from Trump’s earlier Feb. 1
deadline to impose the tariffs, based on a national emergency
declaration.</p>
<p>Any further delay negotiated ahead of the deadline will keep the
tariff threat in place at least until clear evidence emerges that
Canadian and Mexican measures are working, said Dan Ujczo, a lawyer
specializing in U.S.-Canada trade matters.</p>
<p>“There’s progress being made on the security front,” said Ujczo,
senior counsel with Thompson Hine in Columbus, Ohio. “But it’s overly
optimistic to think that those tariffs would be fully rescinded.”</p>
<p>The White House, U.S. Trade Representative’s office and Commerce
Department did not respond to requests for comment on negotiations
expected this week ahead of the March 4 deadline.</p>
<p>More tariff threats</p>
<p>Since Trump’s initial 25% tariff threat and imposition of a 10% duty
on all Chinese imports, he has heaped on more tariff actions that could
muddy the waters on border negotiations.</p>
<p>These include substantially raising tariffs on steel and aluminum to
a flat 25%, rescinding longstanding exemptions for Canada and Mexico,
the largest sources of U.S. imports of the metals. These steep
increases, which also extend to hundreds of downstream steel products,
are due to take effect a week after the border tariffs, on March 12.</p>
<p>Trump has also said he wants to impose 25% tariffs on imports of
autos, pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, and to match duty rates and
trade barriers of other countries.</p>
<p>The threatened tariffs could kick off an early launch of a
renegotiation of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement on trade that is due
by 2026, Ujczo added.</p>
<p>Trump signed the USMCA into law in 2020 after renegotiating the 1994
North American Free Trade Agreement but has increasingly expressed
dissatisfaction with imports of autos from Mexico and Canada.</p>
<p>Progress cited</p>
<p>On Thursday, Mexican Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Thursday
he had a “constructive dialog” during a meeting with Trump’s top trade
officials.</p>
<p>Ebrard said in a post on X that the “joint work” on U.S. trade
matters starts on Monday.</p>
<p>Mexico has begun deploying as many as 10,000 national guard troops to
its northern border, as part of the agreement that Mexican President
Claudia Sheinbaum said also called on the U.S. to work to stop the flow
of firearms into Mexico.</p>
<p>Canada this month created a new fentanyl czar to coordinate the fight
against smuggling of the deadly opioid, appointing senior intelligence
official Kevin Brosseau to the post.</p>
<p>Ottawa also has reclassified drug cartels as terrorist entities and
has deployed drones, helicopters and other surveillance technologies on
the vast northern U.S. border.</p>
<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has kept in close contact with
Trump on the border issues in recent days, including in a Saturday call
that included discussions of joint efforts to curb fentanyl trade. He
has threatened retaliatory tariffs on $107 billion of U.S. imports,
including American beer, wine and bourbon and Florida orange juice, but
said last week that Canada is “going to do the work” to ensure that
tariffs are not imposed.</p>

<h2 id="trump-hosts-french-leader-to-discuss-ukraine-endgame-1">Trump
hosts French leader to discuss Ukraine endgame</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>President Donald Trump said Monday he’s nearing a deal with Ukraine
and with Russia to end the war in Ukraine after a packed day of meetings
at the White House with French President Emmanuel Macron.</p>
<p>Trump urged Europe to take a bigger role in funding, and Paris pushed
for more assurances from Moscow.</p>
<p>The U.S. president pushed his desire for a deal to end the war, which
struck its grim third anniversary Monday. He has said this will include
an agreement with Ukraine for its critical minerals — a deal he hinted
could be signed as soon as next week by Ukraine’s president.</p>
<p>“There’s tremendous distrust on both sides,” Trump said. “That’s why
it’s good that I’m coming in now. But I think it’s to the very much
benefit of Russia to make a deal and to go on with leading Russia in a
very positive way. That’s what you have to do. But I really believe that
he wants to make a deal. I may be wrong, but I believe he wants to make
a deal.”</p>
<p>Macron was more circumspect, correcting Trump in the Oval Office when
Trump said Europe supported Ukraine with a loan. Macron then warned
against trusting Moscow.</p>
<p>“Let’s try to get something first which … can be assessed, checked
and verified,” he said in English. “And let’s be sure that we build
sufficient guarantees in the short run. And this is where we are ready
to be engaged. As for France, a lot of my European colleagues are ready
to be engaged. But we do need this American backup, because this is part
of the credibility of the security guarantees. And this is our
collective deterrence capacity. And I have the feeling that the
president has this capacity.”</p>
<p>Analysts spoke of what the two leaders accomplished in their
meetings.</p>
<p>“It looks like they agreed to have European peacekeepers enforce the
peace between Russia and Ukraine,” said William Pomeranz, a senior
scholar at the Wilson Center Kennan Institute. “There are a lot of other
side issues that I haven’t really been able to get a hold of, but yes,
there are attempts to have a peace agreement and a use of peacekeepers
to enforce the agreement between Russia and Ukraine.”</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed hope and emphasized
the importance of Washington’s role.</p>
<p>“Our teams are already working productively with the U.S. on an
economic agreement, which we hope to sign in Washington,” he said in
English. “And President Trump, we would really like to hear from you,
because all our people, all our families, are very worried: ‘Will there
be support from America? Will America be the leader of the free world?’
And I want to be very honest, very honest with you: For our people, for
life in general, it is so important that American support, American
assistance remains.”</p>
<p>But other world leaders expressed concerns that Ukraine was kept out
of high-level discussions in Saudi Arabia between Washington and Moscow.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who recently met with Zelenskyy
in Ankara, also said Russia hasn’t always been part of the process.</p>
<p>“Apart from the Istanbul process, Russia has been excluded from the
tables established so far, and therefore the desired result has not been
achieved,” Erdogan said. “If results are to be obtained from the new
process, Ukraine must definitely be included in the process, and this
war must be ended through mutual negotiations.”</p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said that so far, talks have not
been specific.</p>
<p>“During the phone conversation and at the meeting in Riyadh, we
certainly touched on issues related to the Ukrainian crisis,” he said.
“However, it was not discussed in essence. We only agreed that we would
approach it. That being said, of course, we are not rejecting the
participation of European countries.”</p>
<p>Some analysts warn that Trump’s idea of a deal is not advantageous to
Ukraine.</p>
<p>“We have to see this as a move by Donald Trump to undermine the
legitimacy of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy — and in the worst
case, as Trump advocating for Russia’s position, which has been in the
past that elections have to be part of a negotiation process in Ukraine,
although it’s an entirely Ukrainian domestic issue,” said Liana Fix, a
fellow for Europe at the Council on Foreign Relations.</p>
<p>“So, it’s not only a back and forth between Trump and Zelenskyy. We
do see a broader realignment here of U.S. policy towards a normalization
of relations with Russia, where Ukraine is perceived as a problem to
this normalization,” she said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Europe, as Ukraine somberly marked Monday as the third
anniversary of the war, Paris’ most famous icon, the Eiffel Tower,
burned brightly in the yellow and blue colors of the Ukrainian flag.</p>

<h2 id="top-us-general-in-asia-begins-2-day-visit-to-cambodia">Top US
general in Asia begins 2-day visit to Cambodia</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The top U.S. Army officer for the Asia-Pacific region began a two-day
visit to Cambodia Monday in a trip designed to expand and improve frayed
ties between the two nations.</p>
<p>General Ronald P. Clark, the commanding general of the United States
Army Pacific met with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and senior
Cambodian military officials in Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>Ties between the U.S. and Cambodia have been strained with
Washington’s criticism of Cambodia’s political repression and human
rights violations.</p>
<p>However, the U.S. and other countries are also greatly concerned with
Cambodia’s close ties with China. Of special interest is China’s access
to the Ream Naval Base near the disputed South China Sea, a waterway
China claims almost in full.</p>
<p>In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague rejected China’s
sweeping claims. The naval base is strategically located in the Gulf of
Thailand, which borders the western section of the South China Sea. The
base’s renovation was funded by China.</p>
<p>China has contributed massive amounts of money to Cambodia’s updating
of its infrastructure with the help beginning when the prime minister’s
father, Hun Sen, was leading the country.</p>
<p>That funding continues and later Monday, Manet met with Yin LI, a
member of the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party, according to a
post on the prime minister’s Telegram account.</p>
<p>The post said the Li praised the progress on “all cooperation in all
fields” between Cambodia and China.</p>
<p>During the meeting, Clark also expressed his admiration for Cambodia
for sending U.N. peacekeepers to several international locations,
according to the prime minister’s office.</p>
<p>The prime minister also thanked the U.S. for its assistance in
helping to clear explosives from Cambodia after years of war that left
Cambodia in the late 1990s with 4 million to 6 million land mines and
other unexploded ordnance, including unexploded U.S. bombs.</p>
<p>Clark also met Monday with General Mao Sophan, Cambodia’s military
chief.</p>
<p>The two military generals had “constructive discussions,” the army
said in a statement. Topics of their talks included defense, trade,
tourism, counterterrorism, peacekeeping and demining, the Cambodian army
said.</p>
<p>Their discussion also included the possible revival of the Angkor
Sentinel exercise, the joint military exercises previously held by the
U.S. and Cambodia that were abandoned nearly 10 years ago, the army
said.</p>

France-Presse.</p>

<h2 id="us-lawmakers-rush-to-avoid-march-14-government-shutdown">US
lawmakers rush to avoid March 14 government shutdown</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. lawmakers are one step closer to funding the government past a
March 14 deadline, but Congress still has serious issues to resolve as
they come back to work in the nation’s capital this week. </p>
<p>At question is how and when to enact a proposed extension of the 2017
tax cuts and how to pay down the U.S. deficit without cutting key safety
net programs that help American voters. </p>
<p>President Donald Trump has called for lawmakers to pass “one big,
beautiful bill” that will be a key part of enacting his domestic policy
agenda.  </p>
<p>Despite Trump expressing his preference for the House of
Representatives version of the budget, the Senate passed a funding
resolution Friday that provides $150 billion in military funding and
$175 billion for border security. That measure also avoids the
controversial Medicaid cuts in the House version.  </p>
<p>Senate leadership has proposed passing the tax cuts in a separate
bill later this year. </p>
<p>“Republicans are moving forward on legislation to fund continued
efforts to deport criminal aliens, as well as provide other necessary
resources to secure our border, discourage illegal immigration and
restore respect for the rule of law,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune
said Monday on the Senate floor. </p>
<p>But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer characterized the vote as a
first step toward extending the tax cuts. </p>
<p>“What are Republicans doing? They’re spending precious time trying to
cater to the wishes of the absolutely richest people in America, instead
of working to avoid a disastrous halt of services that help tens of
millions of middle-class American families,” Schumer said Monday.</p>
<p>The Senate moved forward with a vote on its version of the budget due
to uncertainty over the potential success of the vote on the House
version. The two versions will have to be compromised to be signed into
law.  </p>
<p>The House is set to hold a procedural vote on Tuesday, but Speaker of
the House Mike Johnson holds a slim Republican majority and cannot
afford to lose any members of his own to pass his version of the
budget. </p>
<p>Republican Representative Tony Gonzales led a group of seven other
House Republicans warning against potential cuts to health care program
Medicaid, food assistance funding and other social safety net
programs. </p>
<p>“Slashing Medicaid would have serious consequences, particularly in
rural and predominantly Hispanic communities where hospitals and nursing
homes are already struggling to keep their doors open,” the lawmakers
said in a letter to Johnson sent last week. </p>
<p>Republican Representative Thomas Massie, a member of the conservative
Freedom Caucus, also expressed concern about the version of the budget
up for a vote, along with several other undecided House Republicans who
have not yet announced their votes on the measure. </p>
<p>Congressional Democrats also object to the Republican tax cut
proposal, arguing it will harm lower-income and middle-class Americans
who are already concerned about the cost of living and inflation. </p>
<p>In a “Dear Colleagues” letter sent Monday morning, Democratic Leader
Hakeem Jeffries wrote, “Far-right extremists are determined to push
through $4.5 trillion of tax breaks for wealthy Republican donors and
well-connected corporations, explode the debt and saddle everyday
Americans with the bill by ending Medicaid as we know it. We must be at
full strength to enhance our opportunity to stop the GOP Tax Scam in its
tracks.” </p>
<p>Trump posted on Truth Social last week that “The House and Senate are
doing a SPECTACULAR job of working together as one unified, and
unbeatable, TEAM, however, unlike the Lindsey Graham version of the very
important Legislation currently being discussed, the House Resolution
implements my FULL America First Agenda, EVERYTHING, not just parts of
it!” </p>
<p>If lawmakers cannot reach a compromise by March 14, there will be a
partial government shutdown, leaving millions of federal employees
temporarily without pay and suspending some non-essential government
services.</p>

eyes Trump’s Ukraine strategy, strengthens ties with Russia</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>STATE DEPARTMENT — Three years into Russia’s aggression in Ukraine,
China is closely monitoring U.S. President Donald Trump’s strategy to
end the war, as Beijing calculates its moves to position itself as a
strategic partner for Ukraine while maintaining a no‐limits partnership
with Russia, according to experts and former officials. </p>
<p>This week, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President
Emmanuel Macron are set to hold in-person meetings in Washington,
following the Feb. 18 direct talks between senior U.S. and Russian
officials in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. </p>
<p>Macron met with Trump Monday morning at the White House for a meeting
that lasted nearly two hours. Both leaders participated in a
videoconference with other G7 leaders about Ukraine.  </p>
<p>Earlier on Monday, Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke with Russian
President Vladimir Putin, who updated Xi on the Riyadh talks and
reaffirmed the “comprehensive strategic partnership” between Russia and
China. A Chinese readout said, “China welcomes the positive efforts made
by Russia and relevant parties to resolve the crisis.” </p>
<p>‘Crisis’ but not war </p>
<p>For three years, Chinese officials have said Beijing will “play a
constructive role” in the “political settlement of the crisis,”
refraining from using the term “Ukraine war” to describe Russia’s
aggression since Feb. 24, 2022. </p>
<p>Beijing also commended the recent U.S.-Russia talks, during which
Ukraine was not present. </p>
<p>China and Ukraine “established a strategic partnership in 2011. … In
recent years, China has been Ukraine’s largest trading partner,” Chinese
Foreign Minister Wang Yi told Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha
on Feb. 15 on the margins of the Munich Security Conference. </p>
<p>“Regarding the Ukrainian crisis … China has always worked for peace
and promoted talks,” Wang said. Notably, the Chinese readout of the
meeting made no mention of Ukraine’s sovereignty or territorial
integrity. </p>
<p>On Feb. 20, two days after the U.S.-Russia talks, Wang held in-person
discussions with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at the G20
ministerial meeting in Johannesburg, South Africa, where Lavrov briefed
him on the Riyadh talks. Wang reaffirmed China’s “comprehensive
strategic partnership” with Russia. </p>
<p>Wang said China “supports” all efforts dedicated to peace, including
“the recent consensus reached between the United States and Russia” in
Riyadh. </p>
<p>Talks, not negotiations </p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the Riyadh talks — the first
between Washington and Moscow in years — were not negotiations aimed at
striking any deal on Ukraine, despite concerns from Ukraine and European
countries that they were being sidelined.  </p>
<p>He said the talks were intended to determine whether the Russians
were serious about ending the war.  </p>
<p>In a measured tone, Rubio characterized the talks — which lasted for
more than four hours — as steps toward establishing “lines of
communication” on bilateral issues between the United States and Russia.
Among these efforts is the goal of achieving “some normalcy in our
missions and their ability to function.” </p>
<p>Some analysts said Beijing is nervous over a reset of U.S.-Russia
ties.   </p>
<p>“While a complete rapprochement might not be in the cards, they’re
nervous because if Trump lifts sanctions on Russia, then Moscow’s
dependency on China decreases,” Dennis Wilder, who was a top White House
China adviser to former U.S. President George W. Bush, told
RFE/RL.  </p>
<p>But others warned that the U.S. risked bolstering China’s global
information campaign, which portrays Washington as an unreliable
ally. </p>
<p>Retired Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery, a defense analyst at the
Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), said, “We
immediately gave away what leverage we had” and “misattributed who the
aggressor was” while rushing into talks with the Russians. </p>
<p>China, “stumbling into this good news,” certainly gets the benefit,
Montgomery said in a recent webinar hosted by FDD.  </p>
<p>“I have no doubt that diplomats from China are whispering in ears
around the world about the unreliability of Americans, and
unfortunately, this administration is giving them some talking points,”
Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political
Power at the FDD, said during the webinar. </p>
<p>Experts skeptical </p>
<p>A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson declined to comment on
whether China would consider sending peacekeeping forces to Ukraine
after the conflict ends.</p>
<p>Xi and Putin are scheduled to exchange visits to Moscow and Beijing
later this year. The two held a virtual meeting on Jan. 21.
Additionally, Xi took a phone call from Putin on the afternoon of
Feb. 24. </p>
<p>Some former U.S. officials are skeptical about the extent to which
the Chinese government is genuinely willing to act to stop Russia’s war
on Ukraine. They believe China may use the issue as leverage in its
dealings with Trump. </p>
<p>“I think the Chinese will look at the Ukraine issue, and they will
offer some help to Trump. They probably won’t do very much, and then
they will claim success,” Evan Medeiros, director of Georgetown
University’s Asian Studies program, said during a recent podcast with
the German Marshall Fund’s Indo-Pacific program. Medeiros served on the
White House National Security Council from 2009 to 2015. </p>
<p>“Anything that is in their direct material interests, like helping to
rebuild Ukraine, they will embrace. But of course, that doesn’t have to
do with encouraging Russia to reach a peace deal. That’s about ensuring
that Chinese infrastructure companies get lots of big fat contracts,”
Medeiros added.</p>

Supreme Court rebuffs free speech challenge to abortion clinic buffer

<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court declined Monday to hear a
challenge to the legality of buffer zones used to protect access to
abortion clinics and limit harassment of patients in a challenge brought
by anti-abortion activists who have argued that their free speech rights
were being violated.</p>
<p>The justices turned away appeals by self-described “sidewalk
counselors” in New Jersey and Illinois of lower court decisions to throw
out their lawsuits that had claimed that the buffer zones violate free
speech protections under the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment. The
activists had been asking the Supreme Court to overturn its 2000 ruling
allowing a Colorado buffer zone law.</p>
<p>Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito said they
would have taken up the appeals.</p>
<p>The legality of so-called buffer zones that create a perimeter around
abortion facilities, or “floating” zones that put distance between
demonstrators and a clinic’s patients or staff, has been legally
contested for decades. The issue pits free speech rights against
concerns over harassment and violence by anti-abortion protesters.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority. In 2022, the court
overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that had legalized abortion
nationwide, ending its recognition of a woman’s constitutional right to
terminate her pregnancy. Since that ruling, the issue of buffer zones
has regained prominence.</p>
<p>While numerous Republican-led states have banned or severely
restricted abortion, some municipalities in states where it remains
legal have adopted buffer zone ordinances to limit intimidation and
harassment, drawing legal challenges.</p>
<p>In Carbondale, Illinois, a group called Coalition Life that organizes
sidewalk counselors sued after the local city council passed such an
ordinance in 2023. The measure established a floating 8-foot (2.4
meters) buffer that prevents people from approaching people without
their permission in the vicinity of health care facilities, in response
to increased threats and disorderly acts at abortion clinics. The
ordinance has since been repealed.</p>
<p>It had been modeled after a nearly identical Colorado law that the
Supreme Court upheld in 2000 in a case called Hill v. Colorado.</p>
<p>The Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the
coalition’s case in March 2024, noting that the challengers cannot
prevail so long as the Hill ruling remains in place.</p>
<p>Thomas, in his dissent on Monday, criticized the court’s Hill
decision and expressed regret that the justices had declined “an
invitation to set the record straight on Hill’s defunct status.”</p>
<p>“I would have taken this opportunity to explicitly overrule Hill,”
Thomas added.</p>
<p>The coalition’s lawyers had asked the Supreme Court to overrule the
Hill ruling because in places where “anti-abortion views are
disfavored,” buffer zones are a “ready tool to try to silence those who
advance them — and to do so precisely when and where their speech may
matter most.”</p>
<p>In New Jersey, a sidewalk counselor named Jeryl Turco sued the city
of Englewood for adopting a 2014 ordinance that created an 8-foot buffer
zone protecting the entrances and driveways of healthcare
facilities.</p>
<p>The buffer was set after reports of people associated with an
evangelical Christian ministry engaging in aggressive and hostile
protests outside Metropolitan Medical Associates, a local abortion
clinic. Turco was not associated with the ministry, and said she
delivered only peaceful counseling.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out
Turco’s complaint in January 2024, saying a buffer zone can help protect
an individual’s health, safety and access to pregnancy-related services,
and “does not place a substantial burden on Turco’s speech.” The 3rd
Circuit said its ruling was in line with the Hill precedent.</p>
<p>Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood
Federation of America, said after the Supreme Court acted on Monday that
buffer zones “help to create a safer environment for patients, providers
and staff.”</p>
<p>“No patient should have to encounter threats, intimidation and
attacks while seeking health care — and no medical provider or health
center staff should be threatened because of their work to deliver
abortion care to patients in need,” Johnson said.</p>

<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>After devastating wildfires tore through Los Angeles, the 97th
Academy Awards are going forward. </p>
<p>Like the Grammys and other awards shows this year, the ceremony will
be transformed by the fires and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences has pledged to help its members and the broader film community
recover. </p>
<p>Here’s everything you need to know about this year’s show: </p>
<p>When are the Oscars? </p>
<p>The Academy Awards will be held March 2, at the Dolby Theater in Los
Angeles. The show, to be broadcast live by ABC, is scheduled to begin at
7 p.m. Eastern/4 p.m. Pacific. </p>
<p>Who’s hosting the Oscars? </p>
<p>Conan O’Brien is hosting the Academy Awards for the first time.
O’Brien, the late-night host turned podcaster and occasional movie star,
said upon the announcement: “America demanded it and now it’s happening:
Taco Bell’s new Cheesy Chalupa Supreme. In other news, I’m hosting the
Oscars.” </p>
<p>How have the wildfires altered the show? </p>
<p>The wildfires that consumed large parts of Los Angeles in early
January led some to call for the cancellation of the Academy Awards. The
academy twice postponed the announcement of nominations but never pushed
the March 2 date of the ceremony. Academy leaders have argued the show
must go ahead, for its economic impact on Los Angeles and as a symbol of
resilience. </p>
<p>Organizers have vowed this year’s awards will “celebrate the work
that unites us as a global film community and acknowledge those who
fought so bravely against the wildfires.” </p>
<p>Still, the fires have curtailed much of the usual frothiness of
Hollywood’s awards season. The film academy canceled its annual
nominees’ luncheon. </p>
<p>For many involved in the Oscars, the fires have been felt acutely.
O’Brien’s Pacific Palisades home survived but his family has been unable
to go back to it. O’Brien’s assistant and podcast co-host Sona Movsesian
lost her home. </p>
<p>“I know so many people who lost their homes and I’m just, was
ridiculously lucky,” O’Brien told The Associated Press. “So, we want to
make sure that that show reflects what’s happening and that we put a
light on the right people in the right way.” </p>
<p>Who’s presenting at the Oscars? </p>
<p>More stars were added to the presenter lineup last week, including
Selena Gomez, Oprah Winfrey, Joe Alwyn, Goldie Hawn, Ben Stiller, Ana de
Armas, Sterling K. Brown, Willem Dafoe, Lily-Rose Depp and Connie
Nielsen. They’ll join the likes of Halle Berry, Penelope Cruz, Elle
Fanning, Whoopi Goldberg, Scarlett Johansson, John Lithgow, Amy Poehler,
June Squibb and Bowen Yang, as well as last year’s acting winners — Emma
Stone, Robert Downey Jr., Cillian Murphy, Da’Vine Joy Randolph — on the
Oscar stage.</p>
<p>Though the academy initially said it would bring back the “fab five”
style of presenting the acting awards, with five previous winners per
category, organizers have reportedly abandoned those plans for this
year’s ceremony. Nick Offerman will also be participating as the Oscars
announcer. </p>
<p>Will there be any performances? </p>
<p>The academy has announced that, unlike previous years, the original
song nominees will not be performed this time. That doesn’t mean there
won’t be music, though. </p>
<p>Doja Cat, LISA of Blackpink, Queen Latifah and RAYE will be part of
“showstopping performances celebrating the filmmaking community and some
of its legends,” producers announced Monday, as will Wicked’s Cynthia
Erivo and Ariana Grande. (The songs from Wicked weren’t eligible for
best song since, hailing from the Broadway musical, they aren’t original
to the movie.) The Los Angeles Master Chorale will also appear. </p>
<p>What’s nominated for best picture? </p>
<p>The 10 nominees for best picture are: Anora, The Brutalist, A
Complete Unknown, Conclave, Dune: Part 2, Emilia Perez, I’m Still Here,
Nickel Boys, The Substance, and Wicked. </p>
<p>How to watch Oscar-nominated films? </p>
<p>Some of the nominees are still in theaters, but many of this year’s
Oscar nominees are streaming on various platforms.  </p>
<p>Who are the favorites? </p>
<p>More than most years, that’s a tricky question, but a front-runner
had emerged after Anora took the top awards at the Producers Guild,
Directors Guild and Independent Spirit Awards. The best picture race had
been seen as unusually wide open, with Anora, Conclave, The Brutalist, A
Complete Unknown and Emilia Perez all having legitimate hopes of winning
— the hopes of Conclave further boosted by its Screen Actors Guild
ensemble win. </p>
<p>In the acting categories, Demi Moore (The Substance) is favored for
best actress, although Mikey Madison’s BAFTA and Independent Spirit wins
for Anora makes it more of a race. Adrien Brody (The Brutalist) is most
likely in best actor — though SAG winner Timothee Chalamet could
threaten — while Zoe Saldana (Emilia Perez) is the supporting actress
front-runner and Kieran Culkin (A Real Pain) is the favorite for best
supporting actor. None of those awards, however, is considered a
definite lock. </p>
<p>What’s the deal with ‘Emilia Perez’? </p>
<p>Jacques Audiard’s Emilia Perez, a narco-musical about a Mexican drug
lord who undergoes gender-affirming surgery, comes in with a leading 13
nominations. The film, at one point, seemed like Netflix’s best chance
yet to land the streamer its first best picture win. Its star, Karla
Sofia Gascon, made history by becoming the first openly trans actor
nominated for an Oscar. </p>
<p>But no nominee has had a rockier post-nominations Oscar campaign.
After old offensive tweets by Gascon were uncovered, the actress issued
an apology. The fallout, though, has badly damaged a movie that was
already a divisive contender, and led Netflix to radically refocus its
flagging campaign.</p>

id="us-judge-allows-trumps-ap-oval-office-ban-to-stand-over-use-of-gulf-of-mexico-name">US
judge allows Trump’s AP Oval Office ban to stand over use of ‘Gulf of
Mexico’ name</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Monday denied a request by the
Associated Press to immediately restore full access for the news
agency’s journalists after President Donald Trump’s White House barred
them for continuing to refer to the Gulf of Mexico in coverage.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee, denied the
AP’s request for a temporary injunction restoring its access to the Oval
Office, Air Force One and events held at the White House.</p>
<p>McFadden said the restriction on “more private areas” used by the
president was different from prior instances in which courts have
blocked government officials from revoking access to journalists.</p>
<p>“I can’t say the AP has shown a likelihood of success here,” McFadden
said during a court hearing.</p>
<p>The judge set an expedited schedule to consider a longer-term order
in the case. McFadden said it appeared the White House had discriminated
against the AP based on its coverage choices.</p>
<p>“That does feel kind of problematic here,” he said.</p>
<p>After the ruling, the White House said in a statement that “asking
the President of the United States questions in the Oval Office and
aboard Air Force One is a privilege granted to journalists, not a legal
right.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the AP said the news agency will “continue to
stand for the right of the press and the public to speak freely without
government retaliation.”</p>
<p>The AP sued three senior Trump aides on Friday, arguing that the
decision to block its reporters from certain locations violates the U.S.
Constitution’s First Amendment protections against government abridgment
of speech by trying to dictate the language they use in reporting the
news.</p>
<p>“The Constitution prevents the president of the United States or any
other government official from coercing journalists or anyone else into
using official government vocabulary to report the news,” Charles Tobin,
a lawyer for the AP, said during a court hearing.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the Trump administration argued the AP does not have a
constitutional right to what they called “special media access to the
president.”</p>
<p>“They do not have a constitutional right to continue that access in
perpetuity,” said Brian Hudak, a Justice Department lawyer defending the
Trump officials.</p>
<p>The suit names three White House officials as defendants: Chief of
Staff Susan Wiles, Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich and White House
press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Leavitt last week said “we feel we are
in the right.” Wiles and Budowich did not respond to requests for
comment.</p>
<p>Trump signed an executive order last month directing the U.S.
Interior Department to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf
of America.</p>
<p>The AP said in January it would continue to use the gulf’s
long-established name in stories while also acknowledging Trump’s
efforts to change it.</p>
<p>The White House banned AP reporters in response. The ban prevents the
AP’s journalists from seeing and hearing Trump and other top White House
officials as they take newsworthy actions or respond in real time to
news events.</p>
<p>The White House Correspondents’ Association said in a legal brief
backing the AP in the case that the ban “will chill and distort news
coverage of the president to the public’s detriment.” Reuters released a
statement in support of the AP.</p>

id="clint-hill-agent-who-leaped-onto-jfks-car-after-president-was-shot-dies-at-93">Clint
Hill, agent who leaped onto JFK’s car after president was shot, dies at
93</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BELVEDERE, CALIFORNIA — Clint Hill, the Secret Service agent who
leaped onto the back of President John F. Kennedy’s limousine after the
president was shot, then was forced to retire early because he remained
haunted by memories of the assassination, has died. He was 93. </p>
<p>Hill died Friday at his home in Belvedere, California, according to
his publisher, Gallery Books, an imprint of Simon &amp; Schuster. A
cause of death was not given. </p>
<p>Although few may recognize his name, the footage of Hill, captured on
Abraham Zapruder’s chilling home movie of the assassination, provided
some of the most indelible images of Kennedy’s assassination in Dallas
on Nov. 22, 1963. </p>
<p>Hill received Secret Service awards and was promoted for his actions
that day, but for decades blamed himself for Kennedy’s death, saying he
didn’t react quickly enough and would gladly have given his life to save
the president. </p>
<p>“If I had reacted just a little bit quicker. And I could have, I
guess,” a weeping Hill told Mike Wallace on CBS’ 60 Minutes in 1975,
shortly after he retired at age 43 at the urging of his doctors. “And
I’ll live with that to my grave.” </p>
<p>It was only in recent years that Hill said he was able to finally
start putting the assassination behind him and accept what
happened. </p>
<p>On the day of the assassination, Hill was assigned to protect first
lady Jacqueline Kennedy and was riding on the left running board of the
follow-up car directly behind the presidential limousine as it made its
way through Dealey Plaza. </p>
<p>Hill told the Warren Commission that he reacted after hearing a shot
and seeing the president slump in his seat. The president was struck by
a fatal headshot before Hill was able to make it to the limousine. </p>
<p>Zapruder’s film captured Hill as he leaped from the Secret Service
car, grabbed a handle on the limousine’s trunk and pulled himself onto
it as the driver accelerated. He forced Mrs. Kennedy, who had crawled
onto the trunk, back into her seat as the limousine sped off. </p>
<p>Hill later became the agent in charge of the White House protective
detail and eventually an assistant director of the Secret Service,
retiring because of what he characterized as deep depression and
recurring memories of the assassination. </p>
<p>The 1993 Clint Eastwood thriller In the Line of Fire, about a former
Secret Service agent scarred by the JFK assassination, was inspired in
part by Hill. </p>
<p>Hill was born in 1932 and grew up in Washburn, North Dakota. He
attended Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, served in the Army
and worked as a railroad agent before joining the Secret Service in
1958. He worked in the agency’s Denver office for about a year, before
joining the elite group of agents assigned to protect the president and
first family. </p>
<p>Since his retirement, Hill has spoken publicly about the
assassination only a handful of times, but the most poignant was his
1975 interview with Wallace, during which Hill broke down several
times. </p>
<p>“If I had reacted about five-tenths of a second faster, maybe a
second faster, I wouldn’t be here today,” Hill said. </p>
<p>“You mean you would have gotten there, and you would have taken the
shot?” Wallace asked. </p>
<p>“The third shot, yes, sir,” Hill said. </p>
<p>“And that would have been all right with you?” </p>
<p>“That would have been fine with me,” Hill responded. </p>
<p>In his 2005 memoir, Between You and Me, Wallace recalled his
interview with Hill as one of the most moving of his career. </p>
<p>In 2006, Wallace and Hill reunited on CNN’s Larry King Live, where
Hill credited that first 60 Minutes interview with helping him finally
start the healing process. </p>
<p>“I have to thank Mike for asking me to do that interview and then
thank him more because he’s what caused me to finally come to terms with
things and bring the emotions out where they surfaced,” he said. “It was
because of his questions and the things he asked that I started to
recover.” </p>
<p>Decades after the assassination, Hill co-authored several books —
including Mrs. Kennedy and Me and Five Presidents — about his Secret
Service years with Lisa McCubbin Hill, whom he married in 2021. </p>
<p>“We had that once-in-a-lifetime love that everyone hopes for,”
McCubbin Hill said in a statement. “We were soulmates.” </p>
<p>Clint Hill also became a speaker and gave interviews about his
experience in Dallas. In 2018, he was given the state of North Dakota’s
highest civilian honor, the Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider Award. A
portrait of Hill adorns the Capitol gallery of fellow honorees. </p>
<p>A private funeral service will be held in Washington, D.C., on a
future date.</p>

id="roberta-flack-grammy-winning-singer-with-an-intimate-style-dies-at-88">Roberta
Flack, Grammy-winning singer with an intimate style, dies at 88</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Roberta Flack, the Grammy-winning singer and pianist whose
intimate vocal and musical style on Killing Me Softly with His Song, The
First Time Ever I Saw Your Face and other hits made her one of the top
recording artists of the 1970s and an influential performer long after,
died Monday. She was 88.</p>
<p>She died at home surrounded by her family, publicist Elaine Schock
said in a statement. Flack announced in 2022 she had ALS, commonly known
as Lou Gehrig’s disease, and could no longer sing,</p>
<p>Little known before her early 30s, Flack became an overnight star
after Clint Eastwood used The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face as the
soundtrack for one of cinema’s more memorable and explicit love scenes,
between the actor and Donna Mills in his 1971 film Play Misty for Me.
The hushed, hymn-like ballad, with Flack’s graceful soprano afloat on a
bed of soft strings and piano, topped the Billboard pop chart in 1972
and received a Grammy for record of the year. In 1973, she matched both
achievements with Killing Me Softly, becoming the first artist to win
consecutive Grammys for best record.</p>
<p>She was a classically trained pianist discovered in the late 1960s by
jazz musician Les McCann, who later wrote that “her voice touched,
tapped, trapped, and kicked every emotion I’ve ever known.” Versatile
enough to summon the up-tempo gospel passion of Aretha Franklin, Flack
often favored a more reflective and measured approach.</p>
<p>For Flack’s many admirers, she was a sophisticated and bold new
presence in the music world and in the social movements of the time, her
friends including the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Angela Davis, whom Flack
visited in prison while Davis faced charges — for which she was
acquitted — for murder and kidnapping. Flack sang at the funeral of
Jackie Robinson, major league baseball’s first Black player, and was
among the many guest performers on the feminist children’s entertainment
project created by Marlo Thomas, Free to Be … You and Me.</p>

<h2 id="apple-to-build-23200-square-meter-facility-in-texas">Apple to
build 23,200-square meter facility in Texas</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. tech giant Apple has announced plans to create some 20,000 jobs
and invest $500 billion over the next four years in the United
States. </p>
<p>Apple says it will expand teams and facilities in nine states across
the country and that it aims to open a 23,200-square-meter server
manufacturing facility in Texas in 2026. </p>
<p>The announcement comes just days after Apple CEO Tim Cook met with
U.S. President Donald Trump. </p>
<p>“We are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we’re proud
to build on our long-standing U.S. investments with this $500 billion
commitment to our country’s future,” Cook said on the investment. </p>
<p>“From doubling our Advanced Manufacturing Fund, to building advanced
technology in Texas, we’re thrilled to expand our support for American
manufacturing. And we’ll keep working with people and companies across
this country to help write an extraordinary new chapter in the history
of American innovation,” he added in a company statement. </p>
<p>Trump thanked Cook and Apple for the investment on Monday morning on
the social media platform Truth Social. </p>
<p>“Apple has just announced a record $500 billion investment in the
United States of America. The reason, faith in what we are doing,
without which, they wouldn’t be investing 10 cents,” Trump said. </p>
<p>Most of Apple’s consumer goods are currently assembled and produced
overseas. Many of them, assembled in China, are liable to 10% tariffs
imposed by Trump earlier in February. </p>
<p>To reduce its reliance on international supply chains, Apple
announced in January that it had begun mass producing its own chips at
an Arizona factory owned by TSMC, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Company. </p>
<p>The TSMC Arizona factory, along with legislation aimed at increasing
U.S. semiconductor production, were two of Trump’s largest industrial
policy moves during his first term. </p>
<p>In a release on its website, Apple said the $500 billion commitment
includes the company’s work with thousands of suppliers across all 50
states, direct employment, Apple Intelligence infrastructure and data
centers, corporate facilities, and Apple TV+ production in 20 states.
 </p>
<p>Apple said it is also set to open a manufacturing academy in
Michigan, offering training led by engineers and local university staff
to support mid-sized manufacturing firms in areas like project
management and manufacturing processes.</p>

<h2 id="us-imposes-new-sanctions-on-irans-shadow-fleet">US imposes new
sanctions on Iran’s ‘shadow fleet’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The United States imposed sanctions on more than 30
people and vessels for their role in selling and transporting Iranian
petroleum-related products as part of Tehran’s “shadow fleet,” the
Treasury Department said. </p>
<p>The sanctions target oil brokers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
and Hong Kong, tanker operators and mangers in India and China, the head
of Iran’s National Iranian Oil Company, and the Iranian Oil Terminals
Company, Treasury said. </p>
<p>It said the vessels sanctioned ship tens of millions of barrels of
crude oil valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars, the department
said in a statement. </p>
<p>“Iran continues to rely on a shadowy network of vessels, shippers,
and brokers to facilitate its oil sales and fund its destabilizing
activities,” said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.  </p>
<p>The sanctions build on those imposed by the Biden
administration.  </p>
<p>Such sanctions target key sectors of Iran’s economy with the aim of
denying the government funds for its nuclear and missile programs. The
move generally prohibits any U.S. individuals or entities from doing any
business with the targets and freezes any U.S.-held assets.</p>

<h2 id="un-to-vote-on-russia-ukraine-war-resolutions">UN to vote on
Russia-Ukraine war resolutions</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A resolution drafted by the United States and another drafted by
Ukraine and backed by the European Union calling for an end to the war
in Ukraine are set for votes Monday at the United Nations.</p>
<p>The U.N. General Assembly is expected to vote on the Ukrainian
resolution, followed by the U.S. resolution. The U.N. Security Council
is expected to hold its own vote on the U.S. resolution later in the
day.</p>
<p>The U.S. resolution calls for “a swift end to the conflict and
further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and the Russian
Federation.”</p>
<p>The U.S.-drafted measure does not mention Russia’s full-scale
invasion of Ukraine, which began three years ago Monday.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Friday that the resolution
would “affirm that this conflict is awful, that the U.N. can help end
it, and that peace is possible.”</p>
<p>“This is our opportunity to build real momentum toward peace,” Rubio
said in a statement.</p>
<p>The more extensive Ukrainian resolution says the Russian invasion
“has persisted for three years and continues to have devastating and
long-lasting consequences not only for Ukraine, but also for other
regions and global stability.”</p>
<p>It calls for “a de-escalation, an early cessation of hostilities and
a peaceful resolution of the war against Ukraine” and highlights the
need for the war to end this year.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian draft says earlier resolutions adopted by the General
Assembly need to be fully implemented, including those calling for
Russia to fully withdraw from Ukraine’s internationally recognized
borders.</p>
<p>General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, but they do
carry the moral weight of the international community.</p>
<p>At the Security Council, a resolution needs the support of at least
nine of the 15 members, with none of the permanent members—Britain,
China, France, Russia, or United States—using their veto power. The U.S.
measure is expected to have enough support Monday.</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said during remarks Monday at
the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva that countries “must spare no
effort to bring an end to this conflict, and achieve a just and lasting
peace in line with the U.N. Charter, international law and General
Assembly resolutions.”</p>
<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia is ready to
negotiate with Ukraine and Europe, but will “stop hostilities only when
these negotiations produce a firm and sustainable result that suits the
Russian Federation.”</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron is visiting the United States for
talks Monday with President Donald Trump that are expected to include
the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Macron said last week that he planned to tell Trump the U.S. leader
“cannot be weak” in the face of Putin.</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is due to visit Washington later
this week for similar talks, and like Macron has emphasized the need for
Ukraine’s sovereignty to be at the center of any peace effort.</p>
<p>A group of leaders including European Commission President Ursula von
der Leyen, European Council President Antonio Costa, Canadian Prime
Minister Justin Trudeau, Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and
Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez visited Kyiv on Monday in a show of
support for Ukraine.</p>
<p>“We are in Kyiv today, because Ukraine is Europe,” von der Leyen said
on X. “In this fight for survival, it is not only the destiny of Ukraine
that is at stake. It’s Europe’s destiny.”</p>
<p>European Union foreign ministers on Monday approved a new round of
sanctions against Russia, which EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said
include measures against ships that work to evade restrictions on
transporting certain goods, banks that circumvent sanctions and
equipment used to pilot drones.</p>
<p>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the new sanctions “entirely
predictable,” and said the European nations seemed to want the war to
continue.</p>
<p>Fighting continued Monday with Russia saying it shot down 23
Ukrainian drones overnight, including 16 over the Oryol region.</p>
<p>Ryazan Governor Pavel Malkov said falling debris from a downed
Ukrainian drone caused a fire at an industrial enterprise.</p>
<p>Ukraine’s military said Monday it shot down 113 of the 185 drones
that Russia used in overnight attacks.</p>

<h2 id="trump-says-dan-bongino-to-be-fbi-deputy-director">Trump says Dan
Bongino to be FBI deputy director</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said in a post on social media
Sunday that Dan Bongino, a conservative talk show host, will be deputy
director of the FBI.</p>
<p>Bongino will join Kash Patel, who was recently confirmed by the
Senate as director of the FBI. Trump said Bongino was named to the role
by Patel. The position does not require Senate confirmation.</p>
<p>“Great news for Law Enforcement and American Justice!” Trump posted
on his social media network, Truth Social, calling Bongino “a man of
incredible love and passion for our Country.”</p>
<p>Bongino was previously a New York City police officer, and a member
of the U.S. Secret Service. He most recently had been known as a
conservative radio host and podcaster.</p>
<p>Trump said in his post that Bongino is “prepared to give up” his
program as he steps into the new role. “The Dan Bongino Show” was most
recently the 56th-ranked podcast in the United States, according to
Spotify.</p>

id="conclave-triumphs-at-sag-awards-timothee-chalamet-wins-best-actor-upending-oscar-predictions">‘Conclave’
triumphs at SAG Awards, Timothee Chalamet wins best actor, upending
Oscar predictions</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The papal thriller “Conclave” won best ensemble and Timothee Chalamet
took best actor at the 31st Screen Actors Guild Awards on Sunday, a pair
of twists that added a few final wrinkles to an unusually unpredictable
awards season.</p>
<p>In winning the guild’s top award, Edward Berger’s Vatican-set drama
triumphed just as the Catholic Church was praying for the health of Pope
Francis, who remained in critical condition Sunday after an asthmatic
respiratory crisis. “Conclave” dramatizes the fictional election of a
new pope. Earlier in the evening onstage, Isabella Rossellini shared the
cast’s best wishes for Pope Francis.</p>
<p>All the momentum going into the SAG Awards was with Sean Baker’s
“Anora,” which had won with the producers, directors and writers guilds.
Now, with “Conclave” winning with the actors and at the BAFTAs, what
will nab best picture in a week’s time at the Academy Awards is, again,
anyone’s guess.</p>
<p>“Wow,” said “Conclave” star Ralph Fiennes taking the stage. “I’ve not
been elected to speak. I’ve been designated to speak on behalf of our
conclave, our ensemble.”</p>
<p>That wasn’t the only surprise in the ceremony held at the Shrine
Auditorium in Los Angeles and streamed lived by Netflix. Chalamet’s best
actor win upset “The Brutalist” star Adrien Brody and put the
29-year-old on course to possibly win his first Academy Award.</p>
<p>Chalamet looked visibly surprised when his name was announced at the
ceremony. But once he reached the staged, the “A Complete Unknown” star
spoke with composure and confidence.</p>
<p>“The truth is, this was 5 ½ years of my life,” said Chalamet. “I
poured everything I had into playing this incomparable artist, Mr. Bob
Dylan, a true American hero. It was the honor of a lifetime playing
him.”</p>
<p>He then added: “The truth is, I’m really in pursuit of greatness. I
know people don’t usually talk like that, but I want to be one of the
greats.”</p>
<p>The other Oscar favorites — Demi Moore, Zoe Saldana and Kieran Culkin
— all won. The SAG Awards are closely watched as an Oscar preview. Their
picks don’t always align exactly with those of the film academy, but
they often nearly do.</p>
<p>The last three best ensemble winners — “Oppenheimer,” “Everything
Everywhere All at Once” and “CODA” — all went on to win best picture at
the Oscars. All but one of the SAG acting winners of the last three
years has also won the Oscar. (The sole exception was Lily Gladstone,
who won SAG’s award for female actor last year for “Killers of the
Flower Moon,” but the Oscar trophy went to Emma Stone for “Poor
Things”.)</p>
<p>Moore seemingly solidified her Oscar chances by following up her
Golden Globe win for her performance in “The Substance.” Moore, whose
campaign was boosted by her speech about being pigeonholed a “popcorn
actress,” has traded awards with “Anora” breakthrough Mikey Madison.</p>
<p>“What we believe is so much more powerful than what we think,” said
Moore. “The saying, ‘I’ll believe it when I see it’ — the reality is
when I believe it, I will see it.”</p>
<p>The SAG Awards unfolded against the backdrop of the aftermath of the
devastating wildfires that began in early January. Those fires forced
the guild to cancel its in-person nominations announcement and launch a
disaster relief fund for SAG-AFTRA members affected. Host Kristen Bell
introduced attending firefighters as “the most attractive tables” among
a sea of stars.</p>
<p>Jane Fonda, 87, given the guild’s Life Achievement Award, provided
the evening with its most passionately political moment. Fonda, a famed
activist, spoke indirectly about President Donald Trump’s
administration.</p>
<p>“We are in our documentary moment,” said Fonda. “This is it. And it’s
not a rehearsal.”</p>
<p>Fonda added that “woke just means you give a damn about other
people.”</p>
<p>“A whole lot of people are going to be hurt by what’s happening, by
what’s coming our way,” said Fonda. “We are going to need a big tent to
resist what’s coming at us.”</p>
<p>Jean Smart, who had advocated for canceling award shows because of
the wildfires, won best female actor in a comedy series for “Hacks.”
Smart didn’t attend, but participated in a pre-taped introduction as her
character, Deborah Vance.</p>
<p>Also not in attendance: Martin Short, though he upset Jeremy Allen
White to win best male actor in a comedy series for “Only Murders in the
Building.” The Hulu series also won for best comedy ensemble.</p>
<p>“Wait, we never win. This is so weird,” said Selena Gomez. “Marty and
Steve (Martin) aren’t here because, you know, they don’t really
care.”</p>
<p>Colin Farrell won his first SAG award, for his performance in “The
Penguin” and also became the first winner ever introduced, by Jamie Lee
Curtis, as “the man who gave me COVID at the Golden Globes.” Farrell
bounded to the stage and promptly responded, “Guilty as charged,” before
blaming Brendan Gleeson for giving it to him.</p>
<p>The night’s first televised award went to Culkin, who has won just
about every award in the category for “A Real Pain.” Gripping the SAG
trophy, he could quickly tell the difference.</p>
<p>“It is funny that the heaviest of all awards is given by actors,”
said Culkin, who characteristically riffed his way through a rambling
acceptance speech before swearing sincerity: “Believe it or not, this
actually means a lot to me.”</p>
<p>Netflix’s “Emilia Perez,” which has seen its awards hopes largely
dashed by controversy over old tweets by lead actor Karla Sofia Gascon,
took home the award for best female supporting actor, for Oscar favorite
Saldana.</p>
<p>For Netflix’s second time around streaming the awards, it inserted
ads sporadically, like a traditional broadcast. Last year, downtimes
were occupied by backstage interviews. Audio issues occasionally marred
the broadcast, including brief interruptions of Fonda’s speech.</p>
<p>After romps at the Emmys and Golden Globes, “Shogun” kept up its
dominance. The FX series won best drama series ensemble, along with
acting awards for Hiroyuki Sanada, Anna Sawai and for best stunt
ensemble. The corresponding award for film went to the stunt performer
ode “The Fall Guy.”</p>

Harris receives prestigious Chairman’s prize at NAACP Image Awards</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — Former Vice President Kamala Harris stepped on the
NAACP Image Awards stage Saturday night with a sobering message, calling
the civil rights organization a pillar of the Black community and urging
people to stay resilient and hold onto their faith during the tenure of
President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>“While we have no illusions about what we are up against in this
chapter in our American story, this chapter will be written not simply
by whoever occupies the oval office nor by the wealthiest among us,”
Harris said after receiving the NAACP’s Chairman’s Award. “The American
story will be written by you. Written by us. By we the people.”</p>
<p>The 56th annual Image Awards was held at the Pasadena Civic
Auditorium in the Los Angeles area.</p>
<p>Harris, defeated by Trump in last year’s presidential election, was
the first woman and the first person of color to serve as vice
president. She had previously been a U.S. senator from California and
the state’s attorney general.</p>
<p>In her first major public appearance since leaving office, Harris did
not reference her election loss or Trump’s actions since entering the
Oval Office, although Trump mocked her earlier in the day at the
Conservative Political Action Conference.</p>
<p>Harris spoke about eternal vigilance, the price of liberty, staying
alert, seeking the truth and America’s future.</p>
<p>“Some see the flames on our horizons, the rising waters in our
cities, the shadows gathering over our democracy and ask ‘What do we do
now?’” Harris said. “But we know exactly what to do, because we have
done it before. And we will do it again. We use our power. We organize,
mobilize. We educate. We advocate. Our power has never come from having
an easy path.”</p>
<p>Other winners of the Chairman’s prize have included former President
Barack Obama, the late Rep. John Lewis and the late actor Ruby Dee.</p>
<p>NAACP Hall of Fame</p>
<p>Harris was honored during the ceremony along with the Wayans family.
The family was inducted into the NAACP Image Awards Hall of Fame in
recognition of pioneering contributions to film, TV, sketch and stand-up
comedy that have shaped Hollywood for decades.</p>
<p>Keenen Ivory Wayans, Damon Wayans Sr., Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans,
Kim Wayans and Damon Wayans Jr. each were recognized.</p>
<p>Marlon Wayans, whose guest appearance on Peacock’s “Bel-Air” was up
for an NAACP award, shared how Keenen Ivory Wayans sparked the family’s
rise.</p>
<p>“He raised us all like Jedis,” he said. “We wouldn’t be here if it
wasn’t for our big brother.”</p>
<p>Marlon Wayans joked that when his brother told their mom he was
leaving college for comedy, she said, “Boy, I’ve known you your whole
life, and you ain’t never said nothing funny. That’s the funniest thing
you’ve said.”</p>
<p>The crowd erupted in laughter, a fitting tribute to a family that has
kept audiences laughing for more than three decades.</p>
<p>The family has a long list of credits. Keenen Ivory Wayans created
the sketch comedy series “In Living Color” in 1990 and directed the 2000
slasher spoof “Scary Movie,” which was written by Marlon Wayans and
Shawn Wayans, who also wrote and starred in “White Chicks” in 2004.
Damon Wayan’s had a starring role in the 1995 comedy “Major Payne,” and
currently co-stars with son Damon Wayans Jr. in the CBS sitcom “Poppa’s
House,” which was nominated for an NAACP Award. The pair also were
nominated for their acting on the show.</p>
<p>Damon Wayans Jr. has acted in two of the most critically acclaimed
comedies in recent years: “Happy Endings” and “New Girl.” Kim Wayans, a
comedian, actor and director, also received praise for her work in the
2011 drama “Pariah.”</p>
<p>Entertainer of the year</p>
<p>Keke Palmer expressed her surprise after her name was called as
winner of the coveted entertainment of the year.</p>
<p>“Oh my gosh. Guys, I didn’t think I was going to win,” said Palmer,
who paid homage to fellow nominee Cynthia Erivo’s Oscar-nominated
performance in “Wicked.”</p>
<p>Palmer starred in the buddy comedy “One of Them Days,” which debuted
No. 1 at the box office last month. She also won an Emmy for her hosting
efforts on NBC’s “Password.”</p>
<p>“It’s such an amazing category to be in with all these people,”
Palmer said. “It’s a beautiful night. It’s Black History Month, y’all.
It’s so important we all come here together and celebrate one another
with one another.”</p>
<p>Other nominees included Kendrick Lamar, Kevin Hart and Shannon
Sharpe.</p>
<p>Awards recognize LA residents impacted by wildfires</p>
<p>Image Awards host Deon Cole honored residents of the nearby Altadena
neighborhood who were affected by January’s devastating Los Angeles-area
wildfires.</p>
<p>A video of the fire devastation played before actor Morris Chestnut
took the stage.</p>
<p>“Homes were lost, stores destroyed, countless lives shattered and
over two dozen souls gone forever,” said Chestnut, a Los Angeles native
who referenced impacted areas such as Altadena, the Pacific Palisades
and Malibu.</p>
<p>“But what was not lost is the spirit of our community,” said
Chestnut, who noted 22 Altadena residents attended the show on Saturday.
Many in the audience stood and applauded.</p>
<p>Cole shifted tone and brightened the mood with a comedic prayer for
Kanye West’s wife to find more clothes after her barely-there Grammys
look and for Shannon Sharpe to finally size up his T-shirts.</p>
<p>The opening act was a lead-up to the evening’s first award: Queen
Latifah as best actress in a drama series for her role in “The
Equalizer.”</p>
<p>Chappelle honored</p>
<p>Dave Chappelle was honored with the President’s Award for his
“thought-provoking humor.”</p>
<p>Accepting the award, Chappelle talked about the NAACP’s push against
negative portrayals of Black people in media and the importance of
representation.</p>
<p>“Every opportunity we get, we just keep chipping away at this monster
of a machine,” he said.</p>
<p>Past recipients of the President’s Award include Jay-Z, Lauryn Hill,
Usher, Rihanna and John Legend.</p>

governor asks Congress for nearly $40 billion for Los Angeles wildfire
relief</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Sacramento, California — California Gov. Gavin Newsom has asked
Congress to approve nearly $40 billion in aid to help the Los Angeles
area recover from January’s devastating wildfires, which he said could
become the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history.</p>
<p>Newsom sent a letter Friday asking for support from lawmakers
including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Rep. Tom Cole, the House
Appropriations Committee chair.</p>
<p>“Los Angeles is one of the most economically productive places on the
globe, but it can only rebound and flourish with support from the
federal government as it recovers from this unprecedented disaster,”
Newsom wrote.</p>
<p>The total economic losses from the firestorm have been estimated to
surpass $250 billion — with real estate losses from the Palisades and
Eaton fires predicted to potentially top $30 billion, according to a Los
Angeles Times analysis. More than 16,200 structures were destroyed as
flames ripped through Pacific Palisades, Malibu, Pasadena and
Altadena.</p>
<p>Newsom vowed that the funding would be used to rebuild homes,
infrastructure, businesses, schools, churches and health care
facilities, while supporting the needs of people affected by the
devastation.</p>
<p>“Make no mistake, Los Angeles will use this money wisely,” Newsom
wrote.</p>
<p>His largest request is for an additional $16.8 billion from the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, mostly intended for the rebuilding
of property and infrastructure, with $5 billion earmarked for debris
cleanup.</p>
<p>Newsom also asked for $9.9 billion from the Department of Housing and
Urban Development for grants to fire victims, homeowners, businesses and
renters, as well as $5.29 billion from the Small Business Administration
for homeowner and business loans.</p>
<p>Newsom thanked President Donald Trump for support for fast-tracking
debris removal. The letter did not mention recent threats by the Trump
administration that federal aid could come with strings attached.</p>
<p>“We are eternally grateful,” Newsom said.</p>
<p>Trump has been a frequent critic of Newsom and California’s water
policies. Ric Grenell, a Trump ally serving as his envoy for special
missions, said Friday that “there will be conditions” to any federal aid
for the state.</p>
<p>He said one of the possible conditions being discussed was defunding
the California Coastal Commission, which regulates coastal development
and protects public beach access. Trump has criticized the agency as
overly restrictive, bureaucratic and a hindrance to timely rebuilding
efforts.</p>

id="trump-administration-fires-2000-usaid-workers-puts-thousands-of-others-on-leave">Trump
administration fires 2,000 USAID workers, puts thousands of others on
leave</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The Trump administration said Sunday that it was placing
all but a fraction of staffers at the U.S. Agency for International
Development on leave worldwide and eliminating 2,000 U.S.-based staff
positions.</p>
<p>The move was the latest and one of the biggest steps yet toward what
President Donald Trump and cost-cutting ally Elon Musk say is their goal
of gutting the six-decade-old aid and development agency in a broader
campaign to slash the size of the federal government.</p>
<p>The move comes after a federal judge on Friday allowed the
administration to move forward with its plan to pull thousands of USAID
staffers off the job in the United States and around the world. U.S.
District Judge Carl Nichols rejected pleas in a lawsuit from employees
to keep temporarily blocking the government’s plan.</p>
<p>“As of 11:59 p.m. EST on Sunday, February 23, 2025, all USAID direct
hire personnel, with the exception of designated personnel responsible
for mission-critical functions, core leadership and/or specially
designated programs, will be placed on administrative leave globally,”
according to the notices sent to USAID workers that were viewed by The
Associated Press.</p>
<p>At the same time, the agency said it was beginning a reduction in
force that would eliminate 2,000 U.S.-based staffers. That means many of
the Washington-based staffers who are being placed on leave would soon
have their positions eliminated.</p>
<p>The Trump appointee running USAID, deputy administrator Pete Marocco,
has indicated he plans to keep about 600 mostly U.S.-based staffers on
the job in the meantime, in part to arrange travel for USAID staffers
and families abroad.</p>
<p>USAID and the State Department did not immediately respond to
messages seeking comment.</p>
<p>The move escalates a monthlong push to dismantle the agency, which
has included closing its headquarters in Washington and shutting down
thousands of aid and development programs worldwide following an effort
to freeze all foreign assistance. Trump and Musk contend that USAID’s
work is wasteful and furthers a liberal agenda.</p>
<p>Lawsuits by government workers’ unions, USAID contractors and others
say the administration lacks the constitutional authority to eliminate
an independent agency or congressionally funded programs without
lawmakers’ approval.</p>
<p>The Trump administration efforts upend decades of U.S. policy that
aid and development work overseas serves national security by
stabilizing regions and economies and building alliances, a critical
tool of U.S. “soft power” for winning influence abroad.</p>
<p>The notices of firings and leaves come on top of hundreds of USAID
contractors receiving no-name form letters of termination in the past
week, according to copies that AP viewed.</p>
<p>The blanket nature of the notification letters to USAID contractors,
excluding the names or positions of those receiving them, could make it
difficult for the dismissed workers to get unemployment benefits,
workers noted.</p>
<p>A different judge in a second lawsuit tied to USAID has temporarily
blocked the foreign funding freeze and said this past week that the
administration had kept withholding the aid despite his court order and
must at least temporarily restore the funding to programs worldwide.</p>

id="some-us-agencies-tell-workers-not-to-reply-to-musks-accomplishments-email">Some
US agencies tell workers not to reply to Musk’s ‘accomplishments
email’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Multiple U.S. federal agencies told employees not to
respond immediately to a demand by President Donald Trump’s adviser Elon
Musk to list their accomplishments in the last week or be fired, as a
chaotic campaign to cull the bureaucracy pushes forward.</p>
<p>Trump administration-appointed officials at the FBI and State
Department sent their staff emails telling them not to respond outside
their chains of command, in a possible sign of tension between members
of the Republican administration and the world’s richest person in his
campaign to cut down the government’s 2.3 million-member civilian
workforce.</p>
<p>“The FBI, through the office of the director, is in charge of all our
review processes,” said FBI Director Kash Patel, a Trump appointee, in
an email to staff seen by Reuters.</p>
<p>Musk leads the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE),
which in the first weeks of Trump’s administration has laid off more
than 20,000 workers and offered buyouts to another 75,000, across wide
swaths of the government from the Defense Department — long a top
Republican priority — to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, where
all staff have been ordered to halt work.</p>
<p>The frantic pace has led the federal government in some cases to rush
to rehire workers who perform critical functions like securing the
nation’s nuclear arsenal and trying to fight the worsening bird flu
outbreak, which has caused egg prices to spike higher.</p>
<p>While there is bipartisan agreement that the U.S. government, which
carries $36 trillion in debt, would benefit from reform, Musk’s
tumultuous approach has drawn widespread criticism, including from
voters in some Republican areas.</p>
<p>Federal workers Saturday evening received an email instructing them
to detail the work they did during the previous week by 11:59 p.m. ET on
Monday (0459 GMT Tuesday), shortly after Musk posted on his X social
media site that failing to respond would be taken as a resignation.</p>
<p>The subject of the email read, “What did you do last week?” and came
from a human resources address in the Office of Personnel Management,
but did not include Musk’s threat of termination.</p>
<p>Workers at the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Education
and Commerce, as well as at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,
the National Institutes of Health and the Internal Revenue Service also
were told not to respond, pending further guidance, according to sources
and emails reviewed by Reuters.</p>
<p>“To be clear — this is irregular, unexpected, and warrants further
validation,” a senior executive at the National Centers for
Environmental Information, an agency that manages environmental data and
is part of the Commerce Department, wrote.</p>
<p>Some officials welcomed the move. Ed Martin, Trump’s nominee for U.S.
Attorney in Washington, D.C., who is serving in an interim capacity,
praised Musk and DOGE in an email response.</p>
<p>But other offices within the Justice Department, including the
executive office that supports all U.S. attorneys and the department’s
civil division, told employees not to reply, pending additional
information.</p>
<p>Employees at the Drug Enforcement Administration, part of the Justice
Department, were told to respond, according to an email seen by
Reuters.</p>
<p>Union questions Musk’s authority</p>
<p>The largest federal workers’ union, the American Federation of
Government Employees, wrote on X on Sunday that it did not believe Musk
had the authority to fire employees who did not respond and would
formally request that OPM rescind the message.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the union advised members to ask their supervisors
directly whether to reply and to follow their guidance.</p>
<p>The email left some employees even more frustrated and worried after
weeks of uncertainty about their futures.</p>
<p>“I really wonder when someone is going to say enough,” one IRS
employee told Reuters.</p>
<p>Media offices at the Commerce, Justice, Education and Treasury
departments, as well as at the FDIC and NIH, did not immediately respond
to requests for comment. An FBI spokesperson declined to comment, and a
State Department spokesperson referred questions to the White House.</p>
<p>Musk on X on Sunday called the email “a very basic pulse check.”</p>
<p>Senator John Curtis, a Republican from Utah, said he supports the
Trump administration’s efforts to reduce government spending, but that
Musk should take a more humane approach.</p>
<p>“If I could say one thing to Elon Musk, it’s please put a dose of
compassion in this,” Curtis said on CBS News’ “Face the Nation.”</p>
<p>“These are real people. These are real lives. These are mortgages.
It’s a false narrative to say we have to cut, and you have to be cruel
to do it as well.”</p>
<p>Some federal judiciary employees, including judges, also received the
Saturday email from OPM, even though the court system is not part of the
executive branch, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts
confirmed.</p>
<p>The judiciary advised employees that no action should be taken in
response to the message, according to an email reviewed by Reuters.</p>
<p>In some cases, employees were left unsure how to respond even if they
chose to do so.</p>
<p>Some lawyers, for instance, expressed concern that their work is
confidential.</p>
<p>Workers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also received the
email, according to people with knowledge of the matter, even though
they were all ordered to cease working since early this month, leaving
them with little to do.</p>

id="hegseth-defends-trumps-firings-of-pentagon-leaders-says-more-may-be-to-come">Hegseth
defends Trump’s firings of Pentagon leaders, says more may be to
come</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth insists President Donald
Trump ’s abrupt firing of the nation’s senior military officer amid a
wave of dismissals at the Pentagon wasn’t unusual and he suggested more
firings could come.</p>
<p>“Nothing about this is unprecedented,” Hegseth told “Fox News Sunday”
about Air Force Gen. CQ Brown Jr. being removed Friday night as chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “The president deserves to pick his key
national security advisory team.”</p>
<p>Hegseth said “there are lots of presidents who made changes” citing
former commanders in chief, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, George H.W.
Bush and Barack Obama. Obama, Hegseth said, “fired or dismissed
hundreds” of military officials.</p>
<p>Months into his first term, Obama removed Army Gen. David McKiernan
from being commander of the U.S. forces in Afghanistan. However, Trump,
while running for his second term, vowed to eradicate “woke” ideologies
from the military and to swiftly dismiss many top leaders.</p>
<p>Hegseth and Trump have made no secret about focusing on pushing aside
military officers who have supported diversity, equity and inclusion in
the ranks. The administration says the move will better fortify a lethal
fighting force.</p>
<p>Brown was just the second Black general to serve as chairman. His 16
months in the post were consumed with the war in Ukraine and the
expanded conflict in the Middle East. Trump in 2020 nominated Brown as
Air Force’s chief of staff.</p>
<p>Trump wants to replace Brown with Air Force Lt. Gen. Dan “Razin”
Caine, who retired in December. It is unclear what recalling Caine to
active-duty service will require. The position requires Caine to be
confirmed by the Senate.</p>
<p>Hegseth said Friday’s dismissals affected six three- and four-star
generals and were “a reflection of the president wanting the right
people around him to execute the national security approach we want to
take.”</p>
<p>He called Brown “honorable” but said he is “not the right man for the
moment,” without citing specific deficiencies. After the 2020 murder of
George Floyd, Brown in a video spoke of his experience as a Black pilot,
apparently making him fodder for the Trump administration’s wars against
inclusion initiatives in the military.</p>
<p>Of Caine, Hegseth said that Trump “respects leaders who untie the
hands of war fighters in a very dangerous world.”</p>
<p>Retired Gen. George Casey called the firings “extremely
destabilizing.” Casey, who was Republican President George W. Bush’s
commander of the U.S. and multinational forces in Iraq from 2004 to
2007, also noted that the Trump administration can change Pentagon
policy without changing personnel, but added, that what happened is
“within the president’s prerogative.”</p>
<p>“That’s his prerogative,” Casey told ABC’s “This Week.” “He is the
commander in chief of the armed forces.”</p>
<p>Still, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat on the
Senate Armed Services Committee told ABC that the firings were
“completely unjustified” and that “apparently, what Trump and Hegseth
are trying to do is to politicize the Department of Defense.”</p>
<p>Hegseth was also asked on Fox News about officials potentially
compiling lists of more defense officials they plan to fire. He said
there was no list but suggested that more dismissals could indeed be
coming.</p>
<p>“We have a very keen eye towards military leadership and their
willingness to follow lawful order,” Hegseth said. “Joe Biden gave
lawful orders. A lot of them are really bad,” he said, adding that
things like COVID vaccine mandates “eroded” the military
ideologically</p>
<p>“President Trump has given another set of lawful orders and they will
be followed,” Hegseth said. “If they’re not followed then those officers
will find the door.”</p>

Airlines flight from New York to Delhi lands safely in Rome after
security concern</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Rome, Italy — An American Airlines flight from New York to New Delhi,
India, landed safely in Rome on Sunday afternoon after it was diverted
due to a security concern , which later proved to be “non-credible,” the
airline said. </p>
<p>American Airlines said Flight 292 “was inspected by law enforcement”
after landing at Leonardo da Vinci International Airport and “cleared to
re-depart.” </p>
<p>It didn’t clarify the cause of the security concern, but added an
inspection was required by protocol before the flight could land in New
Delhi. </p>
<p>“The flight will stay in Rome overnight to allow for required crew
rest before continuing to Delhi as soon as possible tomorrow,” the
airline said. </p>
<p>An Associated Press reporter filmed two fighter jets flying over the
airport shortly before the unscheduled landing. Fire trucks were visible
on the landing strip on one side of the plane after it landed. </p>
<p>The airport continued to operate normally, a spokesman with Rome’s
airport said.</p>

quite what it used to be, remained No. 1 at the box office in its second
frame with $28.2 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates
Sunday. But after a debut of $100 million over four days and $88 million
over three days, that meant a steep drop of 68%. </p>
<p>While blockbusters often see significant slides in their second
weekends, only two previous MCU titles have fallen off so fast: 2023’s
“The Marvels,” which fell 78%, and 2023’s “Ant-Man and the Wasp:
Quantumania,” which dropped 70%. </p>
<p>The Anthony Mackie-led “Captain America” installment has been slammed
by critics, and audiences also have graded it poorly, with a “B-”
CinemaScore. “Brave New World,” which fans had hoped would right the
Marvel ship, has been largely met as another example of a once
impenetrable brand struggling to recapture its pre- “Avengers: Endgame”
aura of invincibility. </p>
<p>Still, “Brave New World” has quickly grossed $289.4 million
worldwide, with international sales nearly reaching $150 million. And
with few big-budget offerings arriving in theaters in the coming weeks,
it will have scant competition through much of March. </p>
<p>The biggest new release of the weekend was Oz Perkins’ “The Monkey,”
the director’s follow-up to his 2024 horror hit, “Longlegs.” Adapted
from a Stephen King short story, “The Monkey” opened with $14.2 million
for Neon, the second-best debut for the indie distributor. The best?
“Longlegs,” which launched with $22.4 million. </p>
<p>Neon had much to celebrate over the weekend. Its top awards
contender, “Anora,” by Sean Baker, continues to gather momentum into
next Sunday’s Academy Awards. The best-picture favorite added wins at
the Independent Spirit Awards on Saturday. </p>
<p>Perkins, Neon and Blumhouse, which partnered in the release of “The
Monkey,” have found a productive low-budget collaboration, with more on
the way. Even if “The Monkey” doesn’t reach the heights of “Longlegs”
($126.9 million globally), Perkins and Neon return with “Keeper” this
October. </p>
<p>“The Monkey,” starring Tatiana Maslany and Theo James, revolves
around an old monkey toy found in an attic. Reviews have been good (77%
fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), though audiences were less impressed, giving
it a C+ CinemaScore. Horror films, though, typically grade low. </p>
<p>As it did with “Longlegs,” Neon leaned into cryptic promotion for
“The Monkey,” along with some macabre marketing. A funeral premiere was
held at Los Angeles’ Immanuel Presbyterian Church, and fan screenings
took place at the Hollywood Cemetery. The film, produced by James Wan,
cost $10 million to make. </p>
<p>Lionsgate’s “The Unbreakable Boy” opened with a paltry $2.5 million
in 1,687 theaters. The Christian-themed Jon Gunn-directed film starring
Zachary Levi and Meghann Fahy, is about parents who learn their son is
autistic and has brittle bone disease. </p>
<p>“Paddington in Peru,” the third installment of the marmalade-mad
bear, fell to third place in its second weekend. It grossed $6.5 million
in 3,890 locations, bringing its two-week total to $25.2 million.
“Paddington in Peru” has been most popular overseas, where its collected
$150 million thus far. </p>
<p>“Ne Zha 2,” the animated Chinese juggernaut, took in $3.1 million
from 800 theaters in its second weekend. In China, the sequel has
grossed $1.7 billion this month, setting numerous box-office records.
Those totals put “Ne Zha 2” past “Inside Out 2” ($1.66 billion) as the
highest grossing animated film ever. </p>
<p>Top 10 movies by domestic box office </p>
<p>With final domestic figures releasing Monday, this list factors in
the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and
Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. </p>

<li><p>“Captain America: Brave New World,” $28.2 million. </p></li>

id="washington-kyiv-headed-toward-deal-for-ukrainian-critical-minerals-rights">Washington,
Kyiv headed toward deal for Ukrainian ‘critical minerals’ rights</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The United States and Ukraine said Sunday they are heading toward an
agreement for Kyiv to give Washington a large share of its rare earth
mineral rights as compensation for the billions of dollars in munitions
the U.S. sent to Ukraine to defend itself from Russia’s full-scale
war.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told a news conference in
Kyiv that Ukraine and the U.S. are “making progress” in reaching a deal.
He said a draft of the pact calls for Ukraine to pay the U.S. $2 for
each dollar in aid the U.S. has sent to Kyiv to fight Russia’s invasion,
although details of the would-be agreement have not been disclosed.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy called for security guarantees for Ukraine as part of any
deal and said he wants better financial terms. “I don’t want something
that 10 generations of Ukrainians will have to pay back,” he said.</p>
<p>The war hits the three-year mark on Monday.</p>
<p>Watch related report by Veronica Balderas Iglesias:</p>
<p>The U.S. has been Ukraine’s biggest benefactor, sending $128 billion
in military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, according to
Germany’s Kiel Institute for the World Economy. The U.S. share is just
ahead of the combined $124 billion figure for the 27-nation European
Union.</p>
<p>U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff told CNN’s “State of the Union” that
he expects Zelenskyy will sign the minerals deal this week.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy at first rejected the U.S. demand for half of Ukraine’s
rare earth mineral supplies, which are used in the production of
technology products. Witkoff signaled in the CNN interview that the deal
will now be completed although he did not spell out details of the
agreement.</p>
<p>Witkoff said that European countries made their contributions to
Ukraine’s war efforts after reaching agreement with Kyiv to eventually
be paid back, but the U.S. had no such understanding.</p>
<p>Witkoff said such U.S. support for Ukraine with no repayment terms
made “no sense” to President Donald Trump, a long-time New York real
estate deal maker before entering politics in 2015.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy said, “I had an agreement with [former U.S. President Joe]
Biden and American Congress, I am grateful to the Congress, to the both
parties. And it was support by providing grants. Grant is not a loan.
And we don’t have to return the loan here. Maybe someone does not like
it and thinks that it’s unjust. Maybe. I don’t know. But here is what
this deal was about. It was grant. Therefore, it’s not about the figure.
We simply don’t see it as a loan.”</p>
<p>Trump, who last week called Zelenskyy a “dictator” and accused him of
starting the war even though Russia invaded Ukraine, has demanded the
repayments and blamed his predecessor, Biden, for not securing some form
of compensation guarantee.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy said Sunday he wants Trump to “understand” his position and
come through with concrete security guarantees to help Kyiv defend
itself against the Russian invasion.</p>
<p>“I want very much from Trump understanding of each other,” Zelenskyy
said at his news conference, adding: “Security guarantees from Trump are
much needed.”</p>
<p>Zelenskyy said he was willing to give up his presidency if it meant
peace in Ukraine, quipping that he could exchange his departure for
Ukraine’s entry into NATO, which Russia is adamantly opposed to.</p>
<p>“If [it means] peace for Ukraine, if you really need me to leave my
post, I am ready,” Zelenskyy said. “I can exchange this for NATO
[membership], if that condition is there, immediately.”</p>
<p>The top U.S. and Russian diplomats, U.S. Secretary of State Marco
Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, met in Saudi Arabia
without either Ukrainian or European officials last week to lay the
groundwork for peace talks to end the war. Zelenskyy complained about
Ukraine being excluded from the talks, but Trump said he could have
negotiated with Russia beforehand to talk Moscow out of invading.</p>
<p>“I’ve had very good talks with Putin, and I’ve had not such good
talks with Ukraine,” Trump told U.S. state governors at the White
House.</p>
<p>“They don’t have any cards, but they play it tough,” Trump said of
Ukraine.</p>
<p>Russian state television said in recent days that Trump’s view of the
Russia-Ukraine conflict is “in total alignment with the way we see
things.”</p>
<p>Witkoff said the war “wouldn’t have had to happen” if Ukraine hadn’t
been pushing at the time for membership in NATO. Kyiv is still pressing
to join the 32-nation pact, but Washington says it is unrealistic for
that to happen as part of a negotiated peace settlement to end the
war.</p>
<p>Witkoff said that eventually “you’ll see concessions signed by both
sides” in a peace deal.</p>
<p>Russia now controls about one-fifth of the internationally recognized
Ukrainian territory, with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov saying
Sunday Moscow has no intention of yielding any of the land back to the
Kyiv government.</p>
<p>“The people decided to join Russia a long time ago,” he said,
referring to Moscow-staged votes in eastern Ukraine held amid the
three-year offensive that were assailed as bogus by Kyiv, the West and
international monitors.</p>
<p>“No one will ever sell off these territories,” Peskov said. “That’s
the most important thing.”</p>
<p>A Trump call with Putin two weeks ago set the stage for the
Rubio-Lavrov talks in Saudi Arabia.  </p>
<p>“This is a dialogue between two extraordinary presidents,” Peskov
told state TV.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Zelenskyy said Russia launched 267 overnight drone attacks
on Ukraine, which he condemned as “aerial terror.” Ukrainian officials
reported damage in five regions of the country.  </p>
<p>Zelenskyy said that in the past week, Russia has targeted Ukraine
with nearly 1,150 attack drones, more than 1,400 guided aerial bombs and
35 missiles of various types. </p>

<h2 id="kremlin-hails-putin-trump-dialogue-as-promising">Kremlin hails
Putin-Trump dialogue as promising</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Moscow — The Kremlin on Sunday hailed dialogue between U.S. President
Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin — two “extraordinary”
presidents — as “promising,” and vowed it would “never” give up
territory seized in eastern Ukraine.</p>
<p>Trump broke with Western policy earlier this month by phoning Putin
to discuss how to end the conflict in Ukraine — a call hailed by Moscow
as ending three years of isolation for the Kremlin leader since he
launched his full-scale offensive in February 2022.</p>
<p>Top Russian and U.S. officials then met in Saudi Arabia last week to
discuss a “restoration” of ties and start a discussion on a possible
ceasefire — all without the involvement of Kyiv or Europe.</p>
<p>“This is a dialogue between two extraordinary presidents,” Kremlin
spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state TV on Sunday.</p>
<p>“That’s promising,” he added.</p>
<p>“It is important that nothing prevents us from realizing the
political will of the two heads of state.”</p>
<p>Trump’s overtures to Moscow have triggered alarm in Kyiv and across
Europe.</p>
<p>But it is unclear whether his moves will be able to bring Moscow and
Kyiv closer to a truce.</p>
<p>Peskov on Sunday ruled out any territorial concessions as part of a
settlement.</p>
<p>“The people decided to join Russia a long time ago,” he said,
referring to Moscow-staged votes in eastern Ukraine held amid the
offensive that were slammed as bogus by Kyiv, the West and international
monitors.</p>
<p>“No one will ever sell off these territories. That’s the most
important thing.”</p>
<p>‘God willed it’</p>
<p>Putin said God and fate had entrusted him and his army with “the
mission” to defend Russia.</p>
<p>“Fate willed it so, God willed it so, if I may say so. A mission as
difficult as it is honorable — defending Russia — has been placed on our
and your shoulders together,” he told servicemen who have fought in
Ukraine.</p>
<p>Russia was on Sunday marking Defender of the Fatherland Day — a
holiday hailing soldiers and veterans — a day before the three-year
anniversary of the start of its full-scale offensive.</p>
<p>“Today, at the risk of their lives and with courage, they are
resolutely defending their homeland, national interests and Russia’s
future,” Putin said in a video released by the Kremlin.</p>
<p>Moscow’s army had overnight launched a record 267 attack drones at
Ukraine, Kyiv’s air force said.</p>
<p>Among them, 138 were intercepted by air defense and 119 were
“lost.”</p>
<p>Ukraine did not say what happened to the remaining 10 but a separate
armed forces statement on Telegram said several regions, Kyiv included,
had been “hit.”</p>
<p>AFP journalists in the Ukrainian capital heard air defense systems in
operation throughout the night.</p>
<p>‘Inappropriate remarks’</p>
<p>Amid his outreach to Moscow, Trump has also verbally attacked
Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy falsely claiming Kyiv started the
war and that Zelenskyy was hugely unpopular at home.</p>
<p>The bitter war of words has threatened to undermine Western support
for Kyiv at a critical juncture in the conflict.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy on Sunday called for the Western coalition that has been
helping Kyiv fend off the Russian offensive for the last three years to
hold strong.</p>
<p>“We must do our best to achieve a lasting and just peace for Ukraine.
This is possible with the unity of all partners: we need the strength of
the whole of Europe, the strength of America, the strength of all those
who want lasting peace,” Zelenskyy said on Telegram.</p>
<p>Moscow has reveled in the spat between Trump and Zelenskyy.</p>
<p>“Zelenskyy makes inappropriate remarks addressed to the head of
state. He does it repeatedly,” Peskov said Sunday.</p>
<p>“No president would tolerate that kind of treatment. So his [Trump’s]
reaction is completely quite understandable.”</p>
<p>Scrambling to respond to Trump’s dramatic policy reversal, French
President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will
travel to Washington next week to make the case for supporting
Ukraine.</p>

id="new-fbi-director-patel-will-also-be-named-acting-head-of-firearms-agency-official-says">New
FBI Director Patel will also be named acting head of firearms agency,
official says</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — New FBI Director Kash Patel is expected to be named the
acting head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives,
a Justice Department official said Saturday.</p>
<p>Patel could be sworn in next week, the official said, putting Patel
in charge of two of the Justice Department’s largest agencies in an
unusual arrangement that raises questions about the future of the bureau
that has long drawn the ire of conservatives.</p>
<p>The Justice Department official spoke on the condition of anonymity
to discuss the move before it’s announced publicly. White House
officials didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday
evening.</p>
<p>Patel was sworn in Friday as FBI director after winning Senate
approval despite Democrats’ concerns about the steadfast Trump ally’s
plans to radically overhaul the FBI.</p>
<p>ATF is a separate agency with about 5,500 employees and is
responsible for enforcing the nation’s laws around firearms, explosives
and arson. Among other things, it’s in charge of licensing federal
firearms dealers, tracing guns used in crimes and analyzing intelligence
in shooting investigations.</p>
<p>The move was first reported Saturday by ABC News.</p>
<p>The news comes days after Attorney General Pam Bondi fired the ATF’s
top lawyer. Bondi said in a Fox News interview Friday that she fired
chief counsel Pamela Hicks because the agency was “targeting gun
owners.” Hicks, who spent more than 20 years as a Justice Department
lawyer, said in a social media post that being ATF chief counsel was the
“highest honor” of her career.</p>
<p>Conservatives have long railed against ATF over its role in
regulating firearms and have suggested shuttering the agency. Under the
Biden administration, the ATF advanced new regulations aimed at cracking
down on ghost guns and requiring thousands more firearms dealers to run
background checks on buyers at gun shows or other places outside
brick-and-mortar stores.</p>
<p>In an executive order earlier this month, President Donald Trump
directed the attorney general to review all actions taken by the Biden
administration around firearms “to assess any ongoing infringements of
the Second Amendment rights of our citizens.”</p>
<p>Gun safety groups have raised alarm about putting Patel in charge of
the FBI, with gun control group Brady calling him a “known gun rights
extremist.” Gun Owners of America, a gun rights group, called his
confirmation as FBI director “a major victory for gun owners and
constitutional rights advocates nationwide.”</p>
<p>The last confirmed ATF director was Steve Dettelbach, a former
federal prosecutor, who led the agency from July 2022 until last month.
He was the first confirmed director since 2015 as both Republican and
Democratic administrations failed to get nominees through the
politically fraught process.</p>

id="pakistan-threatens-to-deport-afghans-if-us-relocation-timeline-isnt-met">Pakistan
threatens to deport Afghans if US relocation timeline isn’t met</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD — Pakistan has warned that thousands of Afghan nationals
awaiting relocation and resettlement in the United States will be
deported to Afghanistan if their cases are rejected or not processed on
time.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar issued the warning during a television
interview aired Saturday, noting that the U.S. has promised to relocate
the Afghan community in question from Pakistan “tentatively around
September this year.” His office in Islamabad released the interview
excerpts.</p>
<p>“If any refugee who was undertaken to be taken by another country
after due process —no matter the timeline — if it doesn’t happen and the
country refuses, then for us, that will be an illegal immigrant in
Pakistan, and we might be forced to send such refugee back to [their]
original country, which is Afghanistan,” Dar told Turkey’s TRT national
broadcaster.</p>
<p>However, the chief Pakistani diplomat expressed Islamabad’s
willingness to resolve the issue with Washington, stating that his
government is “examining the situation and will negotiate
[accordingly].”</p>
<p>Last month, U.S. President Donald Trump halted refugee applications
and travel plans until further notice to ensure that refugee entry into
the United States aligns with its national interests.</p>
<p>The decision has stranded around 45,000 Afghans prepared to fly out
of Afghanistan and at least 15,000 qualified refugees currently in
Pakistan, according to #AfghanEvac, a coalition that assists Afghans
with their relocation and resettlement in the U.S.</p>
<p>These individuals were part of Afghan families who fled their country
following the Taliban insurgents’ retaking of power in 2021, primarily
seeking refuge from potential retribution because of their affiliations
with the U.S. and NATO forces during their nearly two-decade-long
presence in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>While about 80,000 of these Afghans have since been relocated from
Pakistan, officials in Islamabad assert that around 40,000 remain in a
state of limbo including around 15,000 in Pakistan destined for the
United States.</p>
<p>Since launching a crackdown on undocumented foreign migrants in
September 2023, Pakistan has forcibly repatriated more than 825,000
undocumented Afghan refugees to their home country, according to the
United Nations.</p>
<p>The government has recently intensified its crackdown, targeting both
documented and undocumented Afghan refugees.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ordered authorities last month to
remove all Afghans from Islamabad and the adjoining city of Rawalpindi
by Feb. 28 before arranging for deporting them to Afghanistan along with
others subsequently. The targeted population encompasses over 2.5
million Afghans nationwide, comprising lawful refugees, documented
economic migrants, and those without legal authorization to remain in
Pakistan.</p>
<p>Sharif’s directive stipulates March 31 as the deadline for the United
States and other countries to process the cases of Afghans awaiting
resettlements, thereby preventing their deportation.</p>

id="macron-starmer-to-meet-trump-offer-ideas-for-ukraine-security-guarantees">Macron,
Starmer to meet Trump, offer ideas for Ukraine security guarantees</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LONDON/PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime
Minister Keir Starmer will travel to Washington next week amid alarm in
Europe over U.S. President Donald Trump’s hardening stance toward
Ukraine and overtures to Moscow on the three-year conflict.</p>
<p>The leaders of Europe’s two nuclear powers, who will be traveling
separately, are expected to try to persuade Trump not to rush into a
ceasefire deal with Vladimir Putin at any cost, keep Europe involved and
discuss military guarantees to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Macron, who is trying to capitalize on a relationship with Trump
built during their first presidential terms, has said agreeing to a bad
deal that would amount to a capitulation of Ukraine would signal
weakness to the United States’ foes, including China and Iran.</p>
<p>“I will tell him: deep down you cannot be weak in the face of
President (Putin). It’s not you, it’s not what you’re made of and it’s
not in your interests,” he said in an hourlong question and answer
session on social media ahead of Monday’s visit to the White House.</p>
<p>The visits come amid a rift between Trump and Ukrainian President
Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom Trump described as a “dictator.” That has
alarmed Kyiv’s European allies, already reeling from a more aggressive
U.S. posture on trade, diplomacy and even domestic European
politics.</p>
<p>Philip Golub, a professor in international relations at the American
University in Paris, said Trump’s rapid-fire moves in his first weeks in
office, as well as the rhetoric from other U.S. officials, had been a
major shock for the Europeans.</p>
<p>“They could not have expected that somehow within the United States
would emerge this ultra-nationalist coalition of forces that would
actually challenge Europe’s voice in world affairs in such a stark and
strong way,” he told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said Macron believed he had a “historic role to play” in going to
Washington to ensure Europe can weigh in on the ultimate negotiations on
Ukraine. “Whether he can actually achieve something, however, in this
visit is an entirely different matter,” he added.</p>
<p>Starmer, who has also warned the end of the war cannot be a
“temporary pause before Putin attacks again,” will be in Washington on
Thursday.</p>
<p>Speaking on a Fox News podcast on Friday, Trump said Macron and
Starmer had not “done anything” to end the war. “No meetings with
Russia!” he said, although he described Macron as “a friend of mine” and
Starmer as “a very nice guy.”</p>
<p>However, the two countries are keen to show Trump they are ready to
take on a bigger burden for European security.</p>
<p>Britain and France are firming up ideas with allies for military
guarantees for Ukraine and their two leaders will seek to persuade Trump
to provide U.S. assurances in any post ceasefire deal, Western officials
said.</p>
<p>Their respective militaries began initial planning last summer for
the post-war scenario, but the discussions accelerated in November after
Trump secured the U.S. presidency, a French military official and two
diplomats said.</p>
<p>They have also been supported in putting together an array of options
by countries like Denmark and the Baltic states as Europeans discuss
what they would be ready to do should there be an accord and
peacekeepers required, officials said.</p>
<p>While both Britain and France have ruled out sending troops to
Ukraine immediately, the plans, still in concept stage, center around
providing air, maritime, land and cyber support that would aim to deter
Russia from launching any future attacks, Western officials said.</p>
<p>Air and sea assets could be based in Poland or Romania, restoring
safe international air space and ensuring the Black Sea remained safe
for international shipping, the official said.</p>
<p>Part of the British and French talks center around the possibility of
sending European peacekeepers. While U.S. boots on the ground may not be
necessary, deterrence in the form of U.S. medium-range missiles and
ultimately nuclear weapons will remain crucial.</p>
<p>The options being discussed would center not on providing troops for
the frontline or the 2,000-kilometer border which would remain secured
by Ukrainian forces, but further to the West, three European diplomats
and the military official said.</p>
<p>Those troops could be tasked with protecting key Ukrainian
infrastructure such as ports or nuclear facilities to reassure the
Ukrainian population. However, Russia has made it clear it would oppose
a European presence in Ukraine.</p>
<p>A French military official said there was little sense in talking
numbers at this stage because it would depend on what was finally
agreed, what international mandate was given and whether non-European
troops would also be involved.</p>
<p>“It’s not about the numbers of troops in Ukraine. It’s the ability to
mobilize and the ability to arrange everything into a package of
interoperability units,” the French official said.</p>
<p>A Western official said that even 30,000 troops could be on the “high
side.”</p>

orders US federal workers to describe what they did at work last week or
get fired</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Elon Musk, the billionaire head of the Trump
administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), threatened
Saturday to fire any federal worker who fails to explain what work they
have accomplished during the previous week. </p>
<p>The threat, issued in a post on the social media site X, was made
just hours after President Donald Trump posted on his own social media
network Truth Social that DOGE should get more aggressive in its
attempts to downsize and reshape the federal workforce. </p>
<p>“All federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to
understand what they got done last week,” Musk posted on X. “Failure to
respond will be taken as a resignation.” </p>
<p>As of Saturday evening, emails were sent to employees at federal
agencies including the Securities and Exchange Commission, National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention and others with the subject line, “What did you do last
week?” </p>
<p>The email, seen by Reuters, asks employees to reply to the email they
have received with five bullet points summarizing “what you accomplished
at work last week” and copy their managers. </p>
<p>The email sent from a human resources address gives employees until
11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Monday to respond. </p>
<p>It is unclear what legal basis Musk has to terminate federal workers
if they fail to respond to his request. </p>
<p>Workers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also received the
email Saturday, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
However, most agency staff had been ordered not to perform any tasks
since early this month, creating a conundrum. The agency is also under a
temporary court order not to resume mass firings pending the outcome of
legal proceedings. </p>
<p>A spokesperson for DOGE did not immediately respond to a request for
comment. </p>
<p>The AFGE, the union representing federal employees, said in a
statement it will challenge any “unlawful terminations.”  </p>
<p>“Once again, Elon Musk and the Trump administration have shown their
utter disdain for federal employees and the critical services they
provide to the American people,” said AFGE National President Everett
Kelley.  </p>
<p>The Trump administration’s fast-paced and controversial process to
reduce government spending by shrinking the federal workforce led by
Musk and his young aides at the cost-cutting DOGE has led to haphazard
firings that resulted in numerous mistakes and forced several agencies
to quickly rehire vital employees, such as those working on nuclear
safety, defense and power generation. </p>
<p>The first wave of job cuts has targeted workers who are easier to
fire, such as employees on the job for less than two years or those who
have started new roles within an agency. </p>
<p>The indiscriminate firings have led to DOGE terminating people whose
jobs are not funded by taxpayers and have begun to anger people across
the country who are concerned about a loss of services as well as the
impact of federal job losses on local economies. </p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly talked about Musk as the functional leader of
DOGE, which is not a Cabinet-level department, but the White House said
in a court filing earlier this month that Musk had no authority over
DOGE and was not an employee of the program.</p>

id="officer-killed-after-gunman-takes-hostages-at-pennsylvania-hospital">Officer
killed after gunman takes hostages at Pennsylvania hospital</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>YORK, PENNSYLVANIA — A man armed with a pistol and carrying zip ties
entered a Pennsylvania hospital’s intensive care unit Saturday and took
staff members hostage before he was killed by police in a shootout that
also left an officer dead, authorities said.</p>
<p>Three workers at UPMC Memorial Hospital, including a doctor, a nurse
and a custodian, and two other officers were shot and wounded in the
attack, York County District Attorney Tim Barker said. A fourth staffer
was injured in a fall.</p>
<p>Gunfire erupted after officers went to engage the shooter, whom
Barker identified as Diogenes Archangel-Ortiz, 49. He said
Archangel-Ortiz was holding at gunpoint a female staff member who had
her hands bound with zip ties when police opened fire.</p>
<p>“This is a huge loss to our community,” Barker said at a news
conference following the shooting. “It is absolutely clear, and beyond
any and all doubt, that the officers were justified in taking their
action using deadly force.”</p>
<p>Barker added that while the investigation is in its early stages, it
appears Archangel-Ortiz had previous contact with the hospital’s ICU
earlier in the week for “a medical purpose involving another individual”
and he intentionally targeted the workers there.</p>
<p>No one answered the door Saturday at an address in York believed to
be that of Archangel-Ortiz.</p>
<p>The officer who died was identified as Andrew Duarte of the West York
Borough Police Department.</p>
<p>“We all have broken hearts and are grieving at his loss,” West York
Borough Manager Shawn Mauck told The Associated Press.</p>
<p>Duarte was a law enforcement veteran who joined the department in
2022 after five years with the Denver Police Department, according to
his LinkedIn profile. He described receiving a “hero award” in 2021 from
Mothers Against Drunk Driving for his work in impaired driving
enforcement for the state of Colorado.</p>
<p>“I have a type A personality and like to succeed in all that I do,”
his LinkedIn profile said.</p>
<p>Duarte also worked as a patrol officer in Denver, was highly regarded
for his work and was close friends with other officers, the department
there said in a statement.</p>
<p>At a makeshift memorial on the front steps of the West York Borough
Police Department, Linda Shields dropped off roses Saturday and dabbed
tears as she thought of her son, a police officer in Maryland.</p>
<p>“He was so young,” Shields said of Duarte. “It makes no sense at
all.”</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro called the attack on police and health
care workers “the act of a coward.”</p>
<p>“Let it not be lost on anyone the act of extraordinary bravery and
courage by the health care workers here, by the law enforcement
professionals … who ran toward danger to keep people safe,” Shapiro
said.</p>
<p>UPMC Memorial is a five-story, 104-bed hospital that opened in 2019
in York, a city of about 40,000 people known for its creation of York
Peppermint Patties in 1940.</p>
<p>The shooting is part of a wave of gun violence in recent years that
has swept through U.S. hospitals and medical centers, which have
struggled to adapt to the growing threats. Such attacks have helped make
health care one of the nation’s most violent fields, with workers
suffering more nonfatal injuries from workplace violence than workers in
any other profession, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention.</p>
<p>In 2023, a shooter killed a security guard in the lobby of New
Hampshire’s state psychiatric hospital before being fatally shot by a
state trooper. In 2022, a man killed two workers at a Dallas hospital
while there to watch his child’s birth. In May of that year, a man
opened fire in a medical center waiting room in Atlanta, killing one
woman and wounding four. And just one month later, a gunman killed his
surgeon and three other people at a Tulsa, Oklahoma, medical office
because he blamed the doctor for his continuing pain after an
operation.</p>

revels in mass federal firings, jeers at Biden before CPAC crowd</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>OXON HILL, MARYLAND — President Donald Trump said Saturday that
“nobody has ever seen anything” like his administration’s sweeping
effort to fire thousands of federal employees and shrink the size of
government. </p>
<p>Addressing an adoring crowd at the Conservative Political Action
Conference in suburban Washington, Trump said, “We’re going to forge a
new and lasting political majority that will drive American politics for
generations to come.” </p>
<p>The president has spent the opening weeks of his administration
arguing that voters in November gave him a mandate to overhaul
government while cracking down on the U.S.-Mexico border and to extend
tax cuts that were the signature policy of his first
administration. </p>
<p>In a speech that lasted more than an hour, Trump predicted that the
Republican Party would defy history, which has shown that a president’s
party typically struggles during midterm congressional elections. Of
Republicans, he said, “I don’t think we’ve been at this level, maybe
ever.” </p>
<p>“Nobody’s ever seen anything like this, and nobody’s ever seen four
weeks like we had,” Trump said, likening his new administration’s
opening month to being on a roll through the first four holes of a round
of golf, which he said gave him confidence for the fifth. </p>
<p>Trump has empowered billionaire Elon Musk to help carry out the
firings; Musk vowed Saturday that more might be coming. </p>
<p>“Consistent with President <span class="citation"
data-cites="realDonaldTrump">@realDonaldTrump</span>’s instructions, all
federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand
what they got done last week,” Musk posted on X, which he owns. “Failure
to respond will be taken as a resignation.” </p>
<p>Trump also repeatedly said Saturday that he’d carry out harder-line
immigration policies. But those efforts have largely been overshadowed
by his administration’s mass federal firings. He announced that one
agency that had been significantly reduced, the U.S. Agency for
International Development, would have its Washington office taken over
by Customs and Border Protection officials. </p>
<p>“The agency’s name has been removed from its former building,” he
said. </p>
<p>The president also repeated his previous promises that his
administration will scrutinize the country’s gold depository at Fort
Knox. </p>
<p>“Would anybody like to join us?” he said to cheers from the crowd.
“We want to see if the gold is still there.” </p>
<p>‘Donald, don’t get angry’ </p>
<p>But Trump also devoted large parts of his address to last year’s
presidential race, jeering at former President Joe Biden and
mispronouncing the first name of former Vice President Kamala Harris —
his Election Day opponent. </p>
<p>He also mentioned Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat who ran for
president in 2020. </p>
<p>The president said immigration and border policy under Biden made him
angry. </p>
<p>“I couldn’t stand it,” Trump said, before cautioning himself,
“Donald, don’t get angry.” He went on to use an expletive to describe
what he thinks of Biden’s handling of border security, despite noting
that evangelical conservatives have urged him not to use foul
language. </p>
<p>Trump had kinder words for Chinese President Xi Jinping, saying “I
happen to like” him, while adding, “we’ve been treated very unfairly by
China and many other countries.” </p>
<p>President meets with world leaders</p>
<p>On the sidelines of the conference, Trump met with conservative
Polish President Andrzej Duda amid rising tensions in Europe over
Russia’s war in Ukraine. After he took the stage, Trump saluted Duda and
Argentine President Javier Milei, who separately addressed the
conference. </p>
<p>Trump called Duda “a fantastic man and a great friend of mine.” He
noted that Milei was “a MAGA guy, too, Make Argentina Great Again.” </p>
<p>Duda is a populist who has enjoyed a close relationship with Trump in
years past. Poland is a longtime ally of Ukraine. Trump upended recent
U.S. policy by dispatching top foreign policy advisers to Saudi Arabia
for direct talks with Russian officials that were aimed at ending
fighting in Ukraine. </p>
<p>Those meetings did not include Ukrainian or European officials, which
has alarmed U.S. allies. After his face-to-face with Duda, Trump is
meeting Monday at the White House with French President Emmanuel Macron
and Thursday with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. </p>
<p>Trump also has begun a public back and forth with Ukrainian President
Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom the U.S. president called a “dictator” while
falsely suggesting that Ukraine started the war — though on Friday he
acknowledged that Russia attacked its neighbor. </p>
<p>Trump said during his speech, “I’m dealing with President Zelenskyy.
I’m dealing with President Putin” and added of fighting in Ukraine, “It
affects Europe. It doesn’t really affect us.” </p>
<p>About ending the war in Ukraine, Trump said Saturday, “I think we’re
pretty close to a deal, and we better be close to a deal.”  </p>
<p>Later, the president and first lady Melania Trump were hosting an
evening reception and dinner at the White House for the National
Governors Association, which was holding their own weekend meetings in
Washington.</p>

<h2 id="us-uzbekistan-reaffirm-commitment-to-central-asia-security">US,
Uzbekistan reaffirm commitment to Central Asia security</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — As the Trump administration begins to engage with
Central Asia, Uzbekistan has expressed eagerness to expand its strategic
partnership, highlighting what it calls its “enhanced” political
dialogue on bilateral and regional issues and security cooperation,
including its “solid connection” with the Mississippi National
Guard.</p>
<p>The U.S. recently got back its seven Black Hawk helicopters from
Uzbekistan that Afghan military pilots had flown there in 2021 while
fleeing the Taliban.</p>
<p>This transfer and other bilateral exchanges within the last month
have underscored Tashkent’s role as Washington’s key partner in Central
Asia, according to U.S. officials. However, analysts see the military
relationship as largely transactional and shaped by geopolitical
complexities and regional tensions.</p>
<p>Talk between diplomats</p>
<p>In a phone conversation on February 21 with Uzbek Foreign Minister
Bakhtiyor Saidov, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio reiterated U.S.
support for the country’s independence, sovereignty, and territorial
integrity, according to State Department’s spokesperson Tammy Bruce.</p>
<p>They discussed a joint effort through the C5+1 diplomatic platform,
launched nearly a decade ago between Washington and five Central Asian
republics. The Trump administration is interested in using this platform
to support “a more peaceful and prosperous Central Asia.”</p>
<p>Saidov described his talk with Rubio as “candid and productive,”
aiming to expand the “strategic partnership between our nations in all
spheres without an exception. Building strong bridges between business
communities, increasing trade volume in both directions, ensuring
prosperous development in Central Asia.”</p>
<p>Cooperation with Pentagon, ties with Mississippi</p>
<p>Uzbek Ambassador Furqat Sidikov says his country’s forces “have stood
shoulder-to-shoulder with the Mississippi National Guard in the best
ways,” citing joint exercises and Pentagon-sponsored professional
exchanges.</p>
<p>“We are a reliable partner of the United States in the region,”
Sidikov said at a January 31 embassy reception, pointing to defense
reforms and improvements in the Uzbek military’s equipment.</p>
<p>Mississippi National Guard Adjutant General Major General Bobby Ginn
emphasized at the event that since 2012, the partnership has facilitated
more than 170 engagements between U.S. and Uzbek soldiers, strengthening
disaster response and readiness.</p>
<p>“Uzbekistan’s commitment to regional stability and contributions to
counterterrorism efforts and border security” demonstrate the power of
its armed forces, Ginn said.</p>
<p>Davis Florick, the Pentagon’s acting principal director for Eurasia,
also attending the reception, thanked Tashkent for “storing” U.S.
aircraft and diligently working with America toward the mutually
beneficial solution. He confirmed that the seven Black Hawks were part
of a fleet from Afghanistan that, according to multiple sources,
included 24 helicopters, among them Mi-17s and UH-60s, and 22 fixed-wing
aircraft, most of which were transferred to Uzbekistan last year.</p>
<p>Another high-level Pentagon official, Rear Admiral Erin Osborne,
speaking at the same gathering, praised Uzbekistan as a “critical ally”
that offered its airspace and an air base during the initial years of
the U.S. military campaign in Afghanistan. The republic was also part of
Pentagon’s Northern Distribution Network, delivering nonmilitary goods
to the international coalition fighting in the neighboring country.</p>
<p>Osborne said that mutual trust and understanding were reflected in
“capacity-building initiatives and the sharing of intelligence to
counter common threats.”</p>
<p>The U.S., she added, is committed to working with Uzbekistan “to
ensure its stability and sovereignty, as well as the stability and
sovereignty of the entire Central Asian region.”</p>
<p>The Taliban and the Afghanistan factor</p>
<p>Even though the transfer of the Black Hawks back to the U.S. was
disclosed at the embassy event, Uzbek officials have been tight-lipped
about this collaboration to avoid any tension with the Taliban, which
has condemned the handovers as an infringement on Afghanistan’s
sovereignty. The Taliban’s Defense Ministry issued a statement
denouncing the transfer as “unacceptable” and demanding the return of
the aircraft.</p>
<p>Eighteen U.S. aircraft also ended up in Tajikistan in 2021, but
Washington and Dushanbe have yet to settle the matter.</p>
<p>During a visit to the region in June 2022, U.S. Central Command
commander General Michael Kurilla said the aircraft would not be
returned to Afghanistan “because they do not belong to the Taliban … Our
hope is to be able to hand over some or all of the aircraft to the Tajik
government.”</p>
<p>Washington analysts view Uzbekistan as the most active U.S. military
partner in the region, comparing it with the activities other republics
in Central Asia have with their state partners, specifically Kazakhstan
with Arizona, Tajikistan with Virginia, and Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan
with Montana.</p>
<p>Still, they characterize Tashkent-Washington security relationship as
more transactional than strategic.</p>
<p>“The Uzbeks want training and equipment. What do we want from them? A
reliable partner in the region,” said a former U.S. official with
extensive experience in Central Asia, speaking to VOA on the condition
of anonymity for professional reasons.</p>
<p>The U.S. has trained Uzbek pilots to operate and maintain the
transferred aircraft, but continued congressional funding — amounting to
several million dollars — is crucial for sustained cooperation.</p>
<p>“There will be questions from Congress, of course,” the former
official said. “The primary justification so far has been that these
assets would help counter extremists from Afghanistan.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, experts in Tashkent support Uzbekistan’s cautious approach
to the Taliban. As officials have said, Uzbekistan will engage with
whoever governs Afghanistan. While it does not officially recognize the
Taliban, the administration of President Shavkat Mirziyoyev has forged
stable diplomatic relations with Kabul, holds significant investment and
business agreements with the country, and provides humanitarian aid to
the Afghan people. Last summer, Uzbekistan opened a free economic zone
in the city of Termez on the border with Afghanistan, inviting neighbors
to foster entrepreneurial cooperation.</p>
<p>U.S. interests and Central Asian security</p>
<p>The U.S. maintains military cooperation agreements with each Central
Asian republic, with plans reviewed annually and subject to funding
approval.</p>
<p>Despite intelligence-sharing efforts, there is no U.S.-Uzbekistan
overflight agreement. Tashkent does not allow its territory to be used
for strikes on neighboring soil, even against terrorist targets.</p>
<p>“The Trump administration may question this,” said the former U.S.
official. “It complicates the case for cooperation with Uzbekistan
because they’re centrally located, yet we must fly around them. It’s
hard to justify what we’re getting in return.”</p>
<p>For years, the U.S. has also supported regional border security
initiatives.</p>
<p>“That’s the big program,” the former U.S. official said, but added:
“How many terrorists have we stopped? How many have been disrupted,
killed, or captured? Do we have those hard numbers? We are still in the
nascent stages of setting up the program.”</p>

<p>date: 2025-02-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday urged
billionaire Elon Musk to be more aggressive in his efforts to shrink the
federal government despite the uproar over layoffs and deep spending
cuts.</p>
<p>“Elon is doing a great job, but I would like to see him get more
aggressive,” Trump posted all in uppercase letters on his Truth Social
platform. “Remember, we have a country to save, but ultimately, to make
greater than ever before. MAGA!”</p>
<p>Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE — an entity
created by Trump — has swept across federal government agencies, firing
tens of thousands of federal government workers, from scientists to park
rangers, mostly those on probation.</p>

summit preparations are underway, Russia says</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Preparations are underway for a face-to-face meeting between U.S.
President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russia’s
deputy foreign minister said Saturday, marking a clear departure from
Western efforts to isolate Moscow over its war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Speaking to Russian state media, Sergei Ryabkov said a possible
Putin-Trump summit could involve broad talks on global issues, not just
the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>“The question is about starting to move toward normalizing relations
between our countries, finding ways to resolve the most acute and
potentially very, very dangerous situations, of which there are many,
Ukraine among them,” he said.</p>
<p>But he said that efforts to organize such a meeting are at an early
stage, and that making it happen will require “the most intensive
preparatory work.”</p>
<p>Ryabkov said that U.S. and Russian envoys could meet “within the next
two weeks” to pave the way for further talks between senior
officials.</p>
<p>Russian and U.S. representatives meeting in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday
agreed to start working toward ending the war in Ukraine and improving
their diplomatic and economic ties, an extraordinary about-face in U.S.
foreign policy under Trump. Senior U.S. officials have suggested Ukraine
will have to give up its goals of joining NATO and retaining the 20% of
its territory seized by Russia.</p>
<p>After the meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told the AP
that the two sides agreed broadly to pursue three goals: to restore
staffing at their respective embassies in Washington and Moscow; to
create a high-level team to support Ukraine peace talks; and to explore
closer relations and economic cooperation.</p>
<p>He stressed, however, that the talks — which were attended by his
Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, and other senior Russian and U.S.
officials — marked the beginning of a conversation, and that more work
needs to be done. Lavrov, for his part, hailed the meeting as “very
useful.”</p>
<p>No Ukrainian officials were present at the meeting, which came as the
beleaguered country is slowly but steadily losing ground against
more-numerous Russian troops, three years after Moscow launched an
all-out invasion of its smaller neighbor.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country would not
accept any outcome from the talks since Kyiv didn’t take part, and he
postponed his own trip to Saudi Arabia scheduled for last Wednesday.
European allies also have expressed concerns they are being
sidelined.</p>
<p>Trump appears to soften Kyiv criticism</p>
<p>Trump on Friday appeared to walk back his earlier comments that
falsely blamed Kyiv for starting the war, but he insisted that Zelenskyy
and former U.S. President Joe Biden should have done more to come to
terms with Putin.</p>
<p>“Russia attacked, but they shouldn’t have let him attack,” he said
during a radio interview with Brian Kilmeade of Fox News, referring to
the Russian leader.</p>
<p>Russia’s army crossed the border on Feb. 24, 2022, in an all-out
invasion that Putin sought to justify by falsely saying it was needed to
protect Russian-speaking civilians in eastern Ukraine and prevent the
country from joining NATO.</p>
<p>Later on Friday at the Oval Office, Trump told reporters that the war
“doesn’t affect the United States very much. It’s on the other side of
the ocean. It does affect Europe.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Marches in London to support Ukraine</p>
<p>Thousands of people waving blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flags marched to
the Russian Embassy in London on Saturday, demanding Ukraine be given
more support and a place at the table in talks to end the three-year
war.</p>
<p>Organizers called for the withdrawal of Russian troops and increased
military aid to strengthen Kyiv’s hand.</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is scheduled to visit Washington
next week for talks focused on Ukraine. He has emphasized that no
decisions about the country’s future can be made without Kyiv’s
involvement.</p>
<p>Starmer spoke with Zelenskyy on Saturday and reiterated “the U.K.’s
ironclad support for Ukraine and commitment to securing a just and
enduring peace to bring an end to Russia’s illegal war,” the prime
minister’s office said.</p>

<p>date: 2025-02-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — This week, thousands of conservative politicians,
activists and influencers convened outside Washington for the
Conservative Political Action Conference, the premier annual gathering
of the American right.</p>
<p>The four-day event, hosted by the American Conservative Union since
1974, features U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance,
among other high-profile speakers from around the world.</p>
<p>Dubbed the “Woodstock for conservatives,” CPAC was once the go-to
event for conservative Republicans and presidential hopefuls, with its
presidential straw poll serving as a barometer of grassroots support.
However, Trump’s political rise in recent years has transformed it into
a platform for populism.</p>
<p>Driven by the rise of populist movements globally, the conference has
ventured overseas in the past decade. It launched its first
international conference in Japan in 2017, expanded to Australia, Brazil
and South Korea in 2019, then added Hungary, Mexico and Israel in 2022.
Argentina joined the fold last year following the election of populist
President Javier Milei.</p>
<p>The international conferences, CPAC says, serve to “unite
conservatives from all over the world, strengthen the movement, and
challenge globalism.” They are also used for public outreach,
recruitment and mobilization, according to a recent paper on CPAC by
Grant A. Silverman, a research assistant at George Washington University
in Washington.</p>
<p>CPAC’s growing international outreach mirrors a recent surge in
far-right populism worldwide. Last year’s foreign speakers included
Presidents Nayib Bukele of El Salvador and Javier Milei of Argentina, as
well as Prime Minister Victor Orbán of Hungary.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at some of the foreign speakers for this year’s CPAC
and what they’re saying:</p>
<p>Javier Milei, Argentine president</p>
<p>Milei, wielding a chain saw, electrified the CPAC crowd Thursday when
he shared the stage with billionaire Elon Musk and presented Musk,
Trump’s cost-cutting czar, with his signature campaign prop.</p>
<p>“This is the chain saw of bureaucracy,” Musk, the CEO of Tesla and
SpaceX, shouted, waving the tool.</p>
<p>As head of the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk, who made
his first CPAC appearance, is spearheading the Trump administration’s
massive governmentwide cost-cutting efforts.</p>
<p>This marks Milei’s third CPAC appearance. The self-styled
“anarcho-capitalist” campaigned in 2023 on shrinking Argentina’s
government, often brandishing a chain saw at rallies.</p>
<p>At last year’s Washington conference, he vowed to eliminate
unnecessary government agencies, declaring, “We will not surrender until
we make Argentina great again!”</p>
<p>Speaking at CPAC Argentina in December, Milei declared that the “new
winds of freedom are sweeping through the world” and called on allies to
fight against “lefties.”</p>
<p>“We must stand together, establishing channels of cooperation
throughout the world,” he told the crowd.</p>
<p>Jair Bolsonaro, former president of Brazil</p>
<p>Brazil’s former right-wing president is a CPAC regular. After
Bolsonaro lost a reelection bid in 2022, his supporters stormed federal
government buildings in an alleged attempt to seize power. Banned from
seeking office until 2030, Bolsonaro faces charges of plotting a
coup.</p>
<p>His son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, organizes CPAC Brazil. At last year’s
conference in Balneario Camboriu, the elder Bolsonaro joined Milei and
other right-wing politicians from Latin America to hail conservatism’s
global rise and expressed hope for Trump’s return to office.</p>
<p>For his part, Milei used the platform to denounce socialism, saying
it restricts liberties and breeds corruption.</p>
<p>Robert Fico, prime minister of Slovakia</p>
<p>Robert Fico makes his CPAC debut this year. Though he leads a
left-wing populist party, he has drawn controversy for his attacks on
journalists, immigrants and LGBTQ+ people.</p>
<p>In October, he called journalists “bloody bastards” and threatened
new media restrictions. An opponent of same-sex marriage, he has called
adoption by gay couples a “perversion.”</p>
<p>During the Ukraine conflict, Fico has opposed European sanctions on
Moscow and echoed Moscow’s messaging, drawing comparisons to Hungary’s
pro-Kremlin prime minister.</p>
<p>In May, he survived an assassination attempt by a gunman opposed to
his stance against military assistance to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Mateusz Morawiecki, former Polish prime minister</p>
<p>After speaking at CPAC Hungary last year, Morawiecki makes his first
U.S. appearance this year. He served as prime minister from 2017 to 2023
and is now a leading figure in the opposition Law and Justice Party.</p>
<p>Despite his party’s strong support for Ukraine, Morawiecki maintains
close ties with Hungary’s Orban and Spain’s Santiago Abascal, leader of
the conservative Vox political party. Abascal is an invited speaker at
CPAC.</p>
<p>Immigration is a unifying issue for Europe’s right-wing populists. At
last year’s Hungary conference, Morawiecki called Orban his friend and
credited his tough response to Europe’s 2015 migration crisis with
preventing “chaos” in Europe.</p>
<p>Liz Truss, former British prime minister</p>
<p>The former Conservative Party leader and prime minister made her
second CPAC appearance in a row Wednesday. Calling Britain a “failed
state” ruled by a socialist government, she called for a Trump-style
MAGA movement to save it.</p>
<p>“We want a Trump revolution in Britain,” she said to applause,
praising Trump’s second presidency as “the golden age of America.”</p>
<p>Blaming Britain’s decline on unelected bureaucrats, she urged the
dismantlement of the “deep state,” a favorite theme among conference
attendees.</p>
<p>“We want Elon and his nerd army of muskrats examining the British
deep state,” Truss said.</p>
<p>Truss served just 49 days as prime minister and lost her Parliament
seat last year.</p>

<p>date: 2025-02-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Congressman Riley Moore recently wrote an op-ed urging the
administration to ban all student visas for Chinese nationals to prevent
the CCP from using U.S. academic institutions as platforms for
espionage. Experts told VOA Mandarin that due to the number of espionage
cases Chinese students in the U.S. involved in, it might be more helpful
to close the CCP-sponsored Chinese students and scholars’ associations

id="in-cpac-remarks-white-house-national-security-adviser-pledges-crackdown-on-mexican-cartels">In
CPAC remarks, White House national security adviser pledges crackdown on
Mexican cartels</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Politicians, media personalities and conservative activists gathered
outside Washington on Friday for the second day of a conference
featuring a range of political allies of President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Speakers at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC)
heralded the Trump administration’s first month in office, with dozens
of executive orders that have proposed sweeping changes to a wide range
of government policies and positions on international issues.</p>
<p>Mike Waltz, the president’s national security adviser, told the CPAC
audience Friday that the Trump administration’s efforts to end the
Ukraine war are certain to include U.S. investments in Ukraine’s mineral
assets as part of a plan to recoup some funding for Ukraine’s
defense.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected a
proposal that would grant American companies 50% ownership of Ukraine’s
rare earth minerals, but Waltz on Friday said the Ukrainian leader “is
going to sign” a revised U.S. offer.</p>
<p>Waltz also said the Trump administration plans to “unleash holy hell”
on drug cartels. On Wednesday, the State Department designated several
Mexican drug cartels as terrorist groups.</p>
<p>Journalist-turned-politician Kari Lake, whom Trump said in December
he would like to see lead Voice of America, spoke about what she sees as
the president’s wins in his first month in office, and her views on
legacy media.</p>
<p>“Watching what President Trump has accomplished and done in one month
is so incredible,” Lake said, referring to actions by the Elon Musk-led
Department of Government Efficiency and the State Department to search
for corruption and curtail spending, including by ending foreign aid
funding.</p>
<p>A former TV journalist in Arizona for nearly 30 years, Lake spoke of
how she quit journalism because of what she felt was disinformation
about the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>“We’re still surrounded by too many fake journalists out there,” Lake
said, adding that she believes the “purpose of the mainstream media is
no longer to inform us, it’s to manipulate us.”</p>
<p>She criticized Associated Press reporting on government officials and
independent bodies who validated the results of the 2020 election,
saying, “They still pretend the 2020 election was the most secure
election in all of history.”</p>
<p>Lake also said that she is honored that Trump named her to lead VOA,
and said she will focus the news agency on producing “accurate and
honest reporting.”</p>
<p>“VOA has been telling America’s story to the world for 83 years this
Monday. Sometimes the coverage has been incredible and sometimes it’s
been pitiful,” Lake said. “We are fighting an information war, and
there’s no better weapon than the truth, and I believe VOA could be that
weapon.”</p>
<p>Among those who have called for the network to be cut is Musk.</p>
<p>“We won’t become Trump TV,” she said, “but it sure as hell will not
be ‘TDS TV.’ You can find all the Trump Derangement Syndrome that you
want over on CNN, MSNBC, PBS, ‘60 Minutes,’ The Washington Post and The
New York Times.”</p>
<p>Trump is expected to address the CPAC gathering on Saturday.</p>

marks war’s 3rd anniversary as US support wavers</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Uncertainty looms over U.S.-Ukraine relations as Ukraine enters the
fourth year of war with Russia. Recent shifts in Washington’s rhetoric
have raised fears that Ukraine could be pressured into an unfavorable
peace deal – or be left to confront Russia without U.S. support. While
most Ukrainians are now in favor of peace talks, many insist any
settlement be on Ukraine’s terms. Myroslava Gongadze has the story from
Warsaw, Poland, with reporting from Anna Chernikova in Kyiv,
Ukraine.</p>

legal battle and the future of the Fed</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-22, from: Market Place, Make me Smart</p>
<p>
The Supreme Court on Friday chose not to intervene in a case involving
President Donald Trump’s firing of an independent agency head. As the
case is passed back to the lower courts, it tees up a legal battle that
will test the president’s power to dismiss officials. We’ll get into
what this could all mean for the Federal Reserve. And, U.S. national
parks are being hit by the administration’s purge of the federal
workforce. Plus, we’ll weigh in on Birkenstocks, prebiotic sodas and the
“White Lotus effect” during a round of Half Full/Half Empty!

<h2 id="trump-fires-chairman-of-joint-chiefs-of-staff">Trump fires
chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump abruptly fired Air Force General
CQ Brown as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Friday, sidelining
a history-making fighter pilot and respected officer as part of a
campaign to rid the military of leaders who support diversity and equity
in the ranks.</p>
<p>The ouster of Brown, only the second Black general to serve as
chairman, is sure to send shock waves through the Pentagon. His 16
months in the job had been consumed with the war in Ukraine and the
expanded conflict in the Middle East.</p>
<p>“I want to thank General Charles ‘CQ’ Brown for his over 40 years of
service to our country, including as our current Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff. He is a fine gentleman and an outstanding leader, and I
wish a great future for him and his family,” Trump posted on social
media.</p>
<p>Trump said he was nominating Air Force Lieutenant General Dan “Razin”
Caine to be the next chairman.</p>
<p>Trump acted despite support for Brown among key members of Congress
and a seemingly friendly meeting with him in mid-December, when the two
were seated next to each other for a time at the Army-Navy football
game. Brown had been meeting regularly with Defense Secretary Pete
Hegseth, who took over the top Pentagon job just four weeks ago.</p>

<h2 id="ap-sues-white-house-officials-over-denial-of-access">AP sues
White House officials over denial of access</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Associated Press filed a lawsuit against three White
House officials on Friday after the news agency was barred from some of
U.S. President Donald Trump’s events.</p>
<p>The AP, in the suit filed in a federal court in Washington, said the
denial of access violates the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution,
which guarantees freedom of speech and of the press.</p>
<p>The White House began blocking AP journalists from the Oval Office 10
days ago over the news agency’s refusal to follow Trump’s executive
order renaming the Gulf of Mexico the “Gulf of America.”</p>
<p>The ban on AP reporters was later extended to Air Force One.</p>
<p>The news group said it was bringing the suit against three Trump
administration officials to “vindicate its rights to the editorial
independence guaranteed by the United States Constitution.”</p>
<p>“The White House has ordered The Associated Press to use certain
words in its coverage or else face an indefinite denial of access,” the
AP said.</p>
<p>“The press and all people in the United States have the right to
choose their own words and not be retaliated against by the government,”
it said.</p>
<p>“The Constitution does not allow the government to control speech.
Allowing such government control and retaliation to stand is a threat to
every American’s freedom.”</p>
<p>The suit names as defendants White House chief of staff Susan Wiles
and deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich, as well as White House press
secretary Karoline Leavitt.</p>
<p>“We’ll see them in court,” Leavitt said during an appearance Friday
at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington.</p>
<p>“We feel we are in the right. We are going to ensure that truth and
accuracy is present at that White House every single day,” she said.</p>
<p>In its style guide, the AP noted that the Gulf of Mexico has “carried
that name for more than 400 years.”</p>
<p>“The Associated Press will refer to it by its original name while
acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen,” it said.</p>
<p>“As a global news agency that disseminates news around the world, the
AP must ensure that place names and geography are easily recognizable to
all audiences.”</p>
<p>Trump called the AP a “radical left organization” on Thursday and
said the new Gulf of America name is “something that we feel strongly
about.”</p>
<p>His leveraging of press access underscores the Republican president’s
long-standing animosity toward traditional news outlets, which he
accuses of bias against him.</p>
<p>The White House Correspondents’ Association has called AP’s exclusion
from Trump events outrageous.</p>
<p>The 180-year-old news agency has long been a pillar of U.S.
journalism and provides news to print, TV and radio outlets across the
United States and around the world.</p>
<p>Voice of America subscribes to The Associated Press, which provides
video, audio and written content.</p>
