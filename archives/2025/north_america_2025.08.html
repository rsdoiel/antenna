killed by Russian air attacks in Ukraine’s Kyiv, Donetsk regions</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Ukrainian officials said Wednesday that Russian aerial attacks in the
Kyiv and Donetsk regions killed at least seven people.   </p>
<p>Donetsk Governor Vadym Filashkin said on Telegram that preliminary

others. </p>
<p>In the Kyiv region, Governor Mykola Kalashnyk said Russian attacks
killed at least two people and injured two others. </p>
<p>Kalashnyk said on Telegram that the attack also damaged nine houses
and four multi-story residential buildings.  </p>
<p>The Ukrinform news agency said journalist Tetyana Kulyk was one of
those killed. It said a Russian drone struck her house.   </p>
<p>Fragments from destroyed drones damaged apartment buildings, a
university building, and a theater in the Kharkiv region in eastern

<h2 id="us-ukraine-near-minerals-deal">US, Ukraine near minerals
deal</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The United States and Ukraine have a framework deal in place for a
joint fund to reinvest revenue from Ukrainian natural resources,
according to officials familiar with the negotiations.</p>
<p>The plan would include investing 50% of proceeds from Ukraine’s
minerals, oil and gas.</p>
<p>The United States would commit to the development of a “stable and
economically prosperous Ukraine.” The framework does not include U.S.
security guarantees for Ukraine, but officials said negotiations were
ongoing.</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump indicated Tuesday he could meet with
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy later this week.</p>
<p>“I hear that he’s coming on Friday. Certainly, it’s okay with me if

that. It’s a big deal.”</p>

id="nominee-for-no.-2-spot-at-pentagon-warns-china-incredibly-determined-to-surpass-us">Nominee
for No. 2 spot at Pentagon warns China ‘incredibly determined’ to
surpass US</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PENTAGON — President Donald Trump’s nominee for deputy secretary of
defense is warning that China’s military is resolute on surpassing the
United States and is calling for a fix to “significant” military
shortages at a time when administration leaders are trying to make big
budget cuts.</p>
<p>“China is incredibly determined, they feel a great sense of urgency,
and they’ll be fully dedicated to becoming the strongest nation in the
world and having dominance over the United States,” Steve Feinberg told
members of the Senate Armed Service Committee on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Feinberg, a businessman and investor, said the U.S. military
shortages include “shipbuilding, nuclear modernization, aircraft
development, cyber defense, hypersonics, counter space, defending our
satellites [and] counter drones.”</p>
<p>“We really need to plug these shortages, focus on our priorities, get
rid of legacy programs, be very disciplined, while at the same time
focusing on the economics. If we do that, given America’s great
innovative capability, entrepreneurship, we will defeat China. If we
don’t, our very national security is at risk,” Feinberg said.</p>
<p>The hearing comes as Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has called on
the department to cut 8% — roughly $50 billion — to reinvest in
priorities aligned with a “more lethal fighting force.”</p>
<p>Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services
Committee, on Tuesday pushed back against the move saying, “Slashing the
defense budget will not create efficiency in our military. It will
cripple it.”</p>
<p>The concern about cuts to the military has echoed on both sides of
the aisle.</p>
<p>Republican committee Chairman Roger Wicker told the Breaking Defense
news organization last month that he hoped to increase defense spending
by as much as $200 billion in coming years.</p>
<p>And Republican Senator Dan Sullivan on Tuesday called for
prioritizing solutions to shipbuilding to counter threats from China and
others.</p>
<p>“We’re in the worst crisis in shipbuilding in over 40 years. The
Chinese are building a giant navy. It’s already bigger than ours,” he
said.</p>
<p>China’s military has about 370 warships, according to the Pentagon’s
latest China Military Power Report, while the U.S. military has about
300.</p>
<p>Feinberg acknowledged that the shipbuilding shortage is “a tough
problem” for the military.</p>
<p>“Our supply chain is definitely weak. Our workforce needs to be
improved. But a big piece of improving our supply chain is working more
closely with our private sector. We have companies that can get at where
our needs are, where our shortages are, and we need to work more closely
with them. We need people inside of government that understand their
issues,” Feinberg said.</p>
<p>Several Democrats on the committee were critical of interference at
the Pentagon by the Department of Government Efficiency, saying it could
create a major vulnerability should its members not handle data more
carefully.</p>
<p>“They [DOGE] just sent an unclassified email with CIA recent hire
names in an unclassified space. As a former CIA officer, you just blew
the cover of someone who was going to risk their life abroad to protect
our country,” said Democratic Senator Elissa Slotkin.</p>
<p>“Do you know how appetizing it is for our adversaries to have this
data? … It is quite literally an issue of safety and security,” she
added.</p>
<p>Democrats also raised concern about plans to let go more than 5,000
Pentagon civilian employees this week, while Republican Senator
Markwayne Mullin countered that cutting 5,000 jobs amounted to less than
0.5% of the workforce.</p>
<p>“Our national debt is now costing us more to just pay interest than
we spend on our military. That’s a huge national security risk,” he
said. “And so, at what point do we start making cuts?”</p>

<h2
id="ukraine-us-agree-on-a-framework-economic-deal-ukrainian-officials-say">Ukraine,
US agree on a framework economic deal, Ukrainian officials say</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>KYIV, UKRAINE — Ukraine and the United States have reached an
agreement on a framework for a broad economic deal that would include
access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals, three senior Ukrainian
officials said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The officials, who were familiar with the matter, spoke on condition
of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. One of
them said Kyiv hopes that signing the agreement will ensure the
continued flow of U.S. military support that Ukraine urgently needs.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office,
said he’d heard that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was coming
and added that “it’s OK with me, if he’d like to, and he would like to
sign it together with me.”</p>
<p>The agreement could be signed as early as Friday and plans are being
drawn up for Zelenskyy to travel to Washington to meet Trump, according
to one of the Ukrainian officials.</p>
<p>Another official said the agreement would provide an opportunity for
Zelenskyy and Trump to discuss continued military aid to Ukraine, which
is why Kyiv is eager to finalize the deal.</p>
<p>Trump called it “a very big deal,” adding that it could be worth 1
trillion dollars. “It could be whatever, but it’s rare earths and other
things.”</p>
<p>According to one Ukrainian official, some technical details are still
to be worked out. However, the draft does not include a contentious
Trump administration proposal to give the U.S. $500 billion worth of
profits from Ukraine’s rare earth minerals as compensation for its
wartime assistance to Kyiv.</p>
<p>Instead, the U.S. and Ukraine would have joint ownership of a fund,
and Ukraine would in the future contribute 50% of future proceeds from
state-owned resources, including minerals, oil, and gas. One official
said the deal had better terms of investments and another one said that
Kyiv secured favorable amendments and viewed the outcome as
“positive.”</p>
<p>The deal does not, however, include security guarantees. One official
said that this would be something the two presidents would discuss when
they meet.</p>
<p>The progress in negotiating the deal comes after Trump and Zelenskyy
traded sharp rhetoric last week about their differences over the
matter.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy said he balked at signing off on a deal that U.S. Treasury
Secretary Scott Bessent pushed during a visit to Kyiv earlier this
month, and the Ukrainian leader objected again days later during a
meeting in Munich with Vice President JD Vance because the American
proposal did not include security guarantees.</p>
<p>Trump then called Volodymyr Zelenskyy “a dictator without elections”
and claimed his support among voters was near rock-bottom.</p>
<p>But the two sides made significant progress during a three-day visit
to Ukraine last week by retired Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg,
Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia.</p>
<p>The idea was initially proposed last fall by Zelenskyy as part of his
plan to strengthen Kyiv’s hand in future negotiations with Moscow.</p>

<h2 id="trump-examines-chinas-copper-production">Trump examines China’s
copper production</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WHITE HOUSE — China’s growing copper reserves have caught the eye of
President Donald Trump, who on Tuesday ordered an investigation into
what administration officials say is Beijing’s move to “gain control of
the world’s copper markets.”</p>
<p>Trump, in the Oval Office, asked his newly minted secretary of
commerce, Howard Lutnick, to explain. Lutnick read from what he said was
a social media post he planned to release, saying: “Tariffs will help
rebuild back our American copper industry and strengthen our national
defense. American industries depend on copper, and they should be made
in America. No exemptions, no exceptions. America first creates American
jobs and protects our national security. It’s time for copper to come
home.”</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Trump’s senior counselor for trade and
manufacturing explained the administration’s concerns.</p>
<p>“China has long used industrial overcapacity and dumping as an
economic weapon to dominate global markets, systematically undercutting
competitors and driving rival industries out of business by massively
subsidizing key industries, flooding international markets with
below-cost goods and then consolidating control once competitors
collapse,” Peter Navarro said in a call with reporters ahead of the
signing. “China has successfully expanded its economic influence in
sectors ranging from steel and aluminum to solar panels and electric
vehicles.”</p>
<p>Trump’s order jumpstarts an investigation under the authority of the
Trade Expansion Act, which focuses on whether importation of a certain
item presents a threat to national security. The president can decide
whether to follow the recommendations of the report, due in 270
days.</p>
<p>China’s government released a report earlier this month where they
laid out a plan to increase copper ore reserves by 5% to 10% by
2027.</p>
<p>Chinese government figures state that in 2024, China topped the world
in the production of both refined copper and copper-processed
materials.</p>
<p>Navarro told reporters the U.S. hopes to do more with the nation’s
“untapped” copper potential and cited plans to boost U.S. production by
70% and reduce external reliance on the material vital for electrical
equipment.</p>

id="apple-shareholders-reject-proposal-to-scrap-companys-diversity-programs">Apple
shareholders reject proposal to scrap company’s diversity programs</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Apple shareholders rebuffed an attempt to pressure the technology
trendsetter into joining President Donald Trump’s push to scrub
corporate programs designed to diversify its workforce. </p>
<p>The proposal drafted by the National Center for Public Policy
Research — a self-described conservative think tank — urged Apple to
follow a litany of high-profile companies that have retreated from
diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives currently in the Trump
administration’s crosshairs. </p>
<p>After a brief presentation about the anti-DEI proposal, Apple
announced shareholders had rejected it. In a regulatory filing submitted
Tuesday evening, Apple disclosed that 97% of the ballots cast were votes
against the measure. </p>
<p>The outcome vindicated Apple management’s decision to stand behind
its diversity commitment even though Trump asked the U.S. Department of
Justice to look into whether these types of programs have discriminated
against some employees whose race or gender aren’t aligned with the
initiative’s goals. </p>
<p>But Apple CEO Tim Cook has maintained a cordial relationship with
Trump since his first term in office, an alliance that so far has helped
the company skirt tariffs on its iPhones made in China. After Cook and
Trump met last week, Apple on Monday announced it will invest $500
billion in the U.S. and create 20,000 more jobs during the next four
years — a commitment applauded by the president. </p>
<p>Tuesday’s shareholder vote came a month after the same group
presented a similar proposal during Costco’s annual meeting, only to
have it overwhelmingly rejected, too. </p>
<p>That snub didn’t discourage the National Center for Public Policy
Research from confronting Apple about its DEI program in a pre-recorded
presentation by Stefan Padfield, executive director of the think tank’s
Free Enterprise Project, who asserted “forced diversity is bad for
business.” </p>
<p>In the presentation, Padfield attacked Apple’s diversity commitments
for being out of line with recent court rulings and said the programs
expose the Cupertino, California, company to an onslaught of potential
lawsuits for alleged discrimination. He cited the Trump administration
as one of Apple’s potential legal adversaries. </p>
<p>“The vibe shift is clear: DEI is out, and merit is in,” Padfield said
in the presentation. </p>
<p>The specter of potential legal trouble was magnified last week when
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier filed a federal lawsuit against
Target alleging the retailer’s recently scaled-back DEI program
alienated many consumers and undercut sales to the detriment of
shareholders. </p>
<p>Just as Costco does, Apple contends that fostering a diverse
workforce makes good business sense. </p>
<p>But Cook conceded Apple may have to make some adjustments to its
diversity program “as the legal landscape changes” while still striving
to maintain a culture that has helped elevate the company to its current
market value of $3.7 trillion — greater than any other business in the
world. </p>
<p>“We will continue to create a culture of belonging,” Cook told
shareholders during the meeting. </p>
<p>In its last diversity and inclusion report issued in 2022, Apple
disclosed that nearly three-fourths of its global workforce consisted of
white and Asian employees. Nearly two-thirds of its employees were
men. </p>
<p>Other major technology companies for years have reported employing
mostly white and Asian men, especially in high-paid engineering jobs — a
tendency that spurred the industry to pursue largely unsuccessful
efforts to diversify.</p>

chief tours Guantanamo Bay as more detainees arrive</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — More migrants slated for deportation from the United
States arrived Tuesday at the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,
under the watchful eye of U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. </p>
<p>Hegseth, visiting the U.S. naval base to get briefings on the
military’s efforts to support Washington’s mass deportation efforts,
posted on social media that he witnessed the U.S. cargo jet land, adding
he is proud to partner with the U.S. agencies working to “remove those
who have infringed on our territorial sovereignty.” </p>
<p>Two U.S. defense officials told VOA that the C-130 carrying nine
migrants from Fort Bliss in Texas landed at Guantanamo Bay midday
Tuesday, and that all nine are considered “high threat illegal
aliens.”</p>
<p>One of the officials said they were taken from the plane to the
detention center, where they were being held under guard. </p>
<p>A third official told VOA that an additional flight carrying more
migrants was tentatively scheduled for Wednesday. </p>
<p>All of the officials spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity since
they were not authorized to discuss the deportation operations.  </p>
<p>The new detainees join another 17 detainees sent from Fort Bliss to
Guantanamo Bay on Sunday.</p>
<p>Neither the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which is
spearheading the U.S. deportation efforts, nor Immigration and Customs
Enforcement (ICE) has so far responded to questions about the identities
of the detainees, their countries of origin or the crimes with which
they are charged.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s flight carrying detainees from the U.S. mainland to the
naval base in Cuba is the second since ICE last Thursday deported 177
detainees who had been brought to Guantanamo Bay earlier this month.</p>
<p>Of the 177, officials had said that more than 120 were dangerous
criminals, including members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan street gang
designated by the U.S. as a foreign terrorist organization.</p>
<p>The other 50 or so individuals had been held at the base’s migrant
operations center, designed to hold nonviolent individuals.   </p>
<p>Hegseth on Tuesday shared photos of his visit to the base on his X
social media account, where he toured both the detention center and the
migrant operations center.  </p>
<p>“These warriors are directly supporting the apprehension and
deportation of dangerous illegal aliens,” he wrote in one post. “We
cannot thank them or their families enough.”</p>
<p>The Pentagon’s deputy press secretary, Kingsley Wilson, also posted
about the visit on her X account, sharing video of the facilities
designed to house “low-priority &amp; medium-priority illegal aliens”
before they are ultimately deported. </p>
<p>The commander of U.S. Southern Command, which oversees operations at
the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, told lawmakers earlier this month that
the base’s migrant facility had the capacity to hold about 2,500
nonviolent detainees. Efforts were underway to allow it to house as many
as 30,000 nonviolent migrants slated for deportation.</p>
<p>U.S. deportation efforts have sparked criticism from immigration
rights groups.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the American Civil Liberties Union and several
other organizations filed a lawsuit against DHS, alleging the detainees
held at the Guantanamo Bay prison facility before being deported
Thursday had been improperly denied access to lawyers.</p>
<p>DHS dismissed the lawsuit’s allegations.</p>

id="house-speaker-secures-enough-republican-votes-to-pass-budget">House
speaker secures enough Republican votes to pass budget</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson secured enough
votes, 217-215, to pass a budget resolution on Tuesday night, advancing
a Republican effort to extend tax breaks and cut spending that Democrats
called “reckless.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We have a lot of hard work ahead of us, but we are going to deliver
the America First agenda,” Johnson told reporters.  “We’re going to
deliver all of it, not just parts of it, and this is the first step in
that process.”</p>
<p>Johnson and other House Republican leaders said in a statement their
goal is a bill “that secures our border, keeps taxes low for families
and job creators, restores American energy dominance, strengthens
America’s standing on the world stage, and makes government work more
effectively for all Americans.”</p>
<p>House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Republicans are working
to “slash and burn” programs such as veterans’ benefits, food
assistance, and health care for lower-income people.</p>
<p>“The reckless Republican budget will cut taxes up to $4.5 trillion
for the wealthy, the well-off and the well-connected, and then they are
sticking working-class Americans, middle-class Americans and everyday
Americans with the bill,” Jeffries told reporters.</p>
<p>Before the vote, several members of the House Republican conference
were still concerned about the size of the spending measure, how and
when to enact a proposed extension of the 2017 tax cuts, and how to pay
down the U.S. deficit without cutting key safety net programs that help
American voters. Senate leadership has proposed passing the tax cuts in
a separate bill later this year.</p>
<p>“Not only are we working to find savings for the American taxpayer, a
better, more efficient use of their dollar, which we are morally
obligated to do, we also have a moral obligation to bend the curve on
the debt,” Johnson said.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump has called for lawmakers to pass “one big,
beautiful bill” that will be a key part of enacting his domestic policy
agenda.</p>
<p>Despite Trump expressing his preference for the House of
Representatives version of the budget, the Senate passed a funding
resolution Friday that provides $150 billion in military funding and
$175 billion for border security. That measure also avoids the
controversial Medicaid cuts of the House version.</p>
<p>Republican Representative Tony Gonzales led a group of seven House
Republicans warning against potential cuts to health care program
Medicaid, food assistance funding and other social safety net
programs.</p>
<p>“Slashing Medicaid would have serious consequences, particularly in
rural and predominantly Hispanic communities where hospitals and nursing
homes are already struggling to keep their doors open,” the lawmakers
said in a letter to Johnson last week.</p>
<p>Trump posted on Truth Social last week that “The House and Senate are
doing a SPECTACULAR job of working together as one unified, and
unbeatable, TEAM, however, unlike the Lindsey Graham version of the very
important Legislation currently being discussed, the House Resolution
implements my FULL America First Agenda, EVERYTHING, not just parts of
it!”</p>
<p>The House and Senate bills will now have to be compromised to be
signed into law.</p>
<p>If lawmakers cannot reach a compromise by March 14, there will be a
partial government shutdown, leaving millions of federal employees
temporarily without pay and suspending some nonessential government
services.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune did not rule out the possibility of
another short-term spending bill to give lawmakers more time to
work.</p>
<p>“We’re keeping all the options on the table, but we are running out
of time,” Thune told reporters Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Senate moved forward with a vote on its version of the budget due
to uncertainty over the potential success of the vote on the House
version.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer characterized the vote as a
first step toward hurting voters.</p>
<p>“Make no mistake, it will rob seniors, kids and the disabled to pay
for the rich to get richer. It’s wrong. We’re going to use every lever
we have at our disposal to lift up the concerns that we are hearing from
our constituents, band together and organize with them and fight to stop
this tax break for billionaires,” Schumer told reporters Tuesday.</p>

<h2 id="us-consumer-confidence-drops-sharply-survey-shows">US consumer
confidence drops sharply, survey shows</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. consumer confidence plunged in February in its biggest monthly
decline in more than four years, a business research group said
Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index dropped from
105.3 in January to 98.3 this month, the largest month-to-month decline
since August 2021.</p>
<p>With U.S. consumer spending accounting for about 70% of the world’s
largest economy, the three major stock indexes on Wall Street all fell
on news of the report. The tech-heavy NASDAQ dropped by more than a
percentage point.</p>
<p>The Conference Board said in a statement, “Views of current labor
market conditions weakened. Consumers became pessimistic about future
business conditions and less optimistic about future income. Pessimism
about future employment prospects worsened and reached a 10-month
high.”</p>
<p>Separately, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent contended Tuesday
that the U.S. economy is more fragile under the surface than economic
indicators suggest, and he vowed to “reprivatize” growth by cutting
government spending and regulation.</p>
<p>In his first major economic policy address, Bessent told a group at
the Australian Embassy in Washington that interest rate volatility,
enduring inflation and reliance on the public sector for job growth have
hobbled the American economy, despite general national economic growth
and low unemployment.</p>
<p>Bessent blamed “prolific overspending” under former President Joe
Biden and regulations that have hindered supply-side growth as the main
drivers of “sticky inflation.”</p>
<p>“The previous administration’s over-reliance on excessive government
spending and overbearing regulation left us with an economy that may
have exhibited some reasonable metrics but ultimately was brittle
underneath,” he said.</p>
<p>Bessent said that 95% of all job growth in the past 12 months has
been concentrated in public and government-adjacent sectors, such as
health care and education, jobs offering slower wage growth and less
productivity than private-sector jobs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he said jobs in manufacturing, metals, mining and
information technology all contracted or flatlined over the same
period.</p>
<p>“The private sector has been in recession,” Bessent said. “Our goal
is to reprivatize the economy.”</p>
<p>Consumers had appeared increasingly confident heading toward the end
of 2024 and spent generously during the holiday season. But U.S. retail
sales dropped sharply in January, with unusually cold weather throughout
much of the U.S. taking some of the blame.</p>
<p>Retail sales fell 0.9% last month from December, the Commerce
Department reported last week. The decline, the biggest in a year, came
after two months of robust gains.</p>
<p>With inflation remaining a concern for consumers and uncertainty
about President Donald Trump’s plan to impose new or stiffer tariffs on
imports from other countries, policymakers at the country’s central
bank, the Federal Reserve, have taken a cautious approach on whether to
further cut its benchmark interest rate.</p>
<p>The Fed left its key borrowing rate alone at its last meeting after
cutting it at the previous three.</p>
<p>“Consumers’ confidence has deteriorated sharply in the face of
threats to impose large tariffs and to slash federal spending and
employment,” Pantheon Macroeconomics chief Samuel Tombs wrote in a note
to clients.</p>
<p>Some information in this report came from The Associated Press,
Reuters and Agence France-Presse.</p>

expands visa restrictions on Cubans tied to labor export program</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States has expanded an existing visa
restriction policy to target Cuban officials believed to be tied to a
labor program that sends Cuban workers overseas, particularly health
care workers, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In a statement, Rubio said the expanded restrictions target
individuals and immediate family members of individuals believed to be
responsible for the program, which he described as “forced labor.” The
U.S. has already imposed restrictions on several people, including some
Venezuelans, he added.</p>
<p>The Caribbean island nation’s health service generates major export
earnings by sending health workers around the world.</p>
<p>“Cuba’s labor export programs, which include the medical missions,
enrich the Cuban regime, and in the case of Cuba’s overseas medical
missions, deprive ordinary Cubans of the medical care they desperately
need in their home country,” Rubio said.</p>
<p>The Cuban government did not immediately respond to a request for
comment.</p>
<p>The United States and Cuba have had a strained relationship since
Fidel Castro took over in a 1959 revolution, and a U.S. trade embargo
has been in place for decades.</p>

Supreme Court throws out Oklahoma man’s murder conviction, death
sentence</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday threw out the murder
conviction and death penalty for Richard Glossip, an Oklahoma man who
has steadfastly maintained his innocence and averted multiple attempts
by the state to execute him.</p>
<p>The justices found that Glossip’s trial violated his constitutional
rights.</p>
<p>The justices heard arguments in October in a case that produced a
rare alliance in which lawyers for Glossip and the state argued that the
high court should overturn Glossip’s conviction and death sentence
because he did not get a fair trial.</p>
<p>The victim’s relatives had told the high court that they want to see
Glossip executed.</p>
<p>Oklahoma’s top criminal appeals court had repeatedly upheld the
conviction and sentence, even after the state sided with Glossip.</p>
<p>Glossip was convicted and sentenced to death in the 1997 killing in
Oklahoma City of his former boss, motel owner Barry Van Treese, in what
prosecutors have alleged was a murder-for-hire scheme.</p>
<p>Glossip has always maintained his innocence. Another man, Justin
Sneed, admitted robbing Van Treese and beating him to death with a
baseball bat but testified he only did so after Glossip promised to pay
him $10,000. Sneed received a life sentence in exchange for his
testimony and was the key witness against Glossip.</p>

<p>U.S. President Donald Trump plans to send 30,000 undocumented
migrants to Guantanamo Bay, the U.S. naval base in Cuba. While it is
most well known for housing terror suspects after 9/11 — and for drawing
condemnation from human rights groups — Guantanamo has been occasionally
used as a processing center for immigrants trying to reach the U.S.,
mostly from Haiti and Cuba. Although Guantanamo’s Migrant Operations
Center is separate from the high-security jail, that doesn’t mean it has
escaped scrutiny.</p>

<h2 id="us-again-sends-high-threat-migrants-to-guantanamo-bay">US again
sends ‘high threat’ migrants to Guantanamo Bay</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The United States has started sending more migrants
deemed by officials to be “high threat” criminal aliens to the U.S.
naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, just days after emptying out the
base’s migrant facilities.</p>
<p>A U.S. defense official confirmed to VOA that a C-130 military cargo
plane carrying migrants left Fort Bliss in Texas and arrived at
Guantanamo Bay on Sunday.</p>
<p>A second defense official said all 17 migrants were assessed to be
“high threat” and are being held at the base’s detention facility.</p>
<p>Both officials spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity to discuss
the deportation operations.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which is spearheading the
U.S. deportation efforts, along with Immigration and Customs Enforcement
(ICE), has not yet responded to questions about the identities of the
latest round of detainees sent to Guantanamo Bay, their countries of
origin, or the crimes with which they are charged.</p>
<p>The latest flight carrying migrants to Guantanamo Bay comes as U.S.
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is set to visit the base Tuesday to
review the military’s efforts to support the mass deportations ordered
by U.S. President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Hegseth, according to a Pentagon statement, “will receive briefings
on all mission operations at the base, including at the Migrant
Operations Center and the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility.”</p>
<p>“The Secretary’s trip underscores the Department’s commitment to
ensuring the security and operational effectiveness of Guantanamo Bay
Naval Station,” the statement added.</p>
<p>ICE announced last Thursday that it had transported 177 migrants
being held at Guantanamo Bay to Honduras, where they were to be picked
up by the Venezuelan government.</p>
<p>U.S. officials had previously said that more than 120 of those
detainees were dangerous criminals, including members of Tren de Aragua,
a Venezuelan street gang designated by the U.S. as a foreign terrorist
organization.</p>
<p>The approximately 50 other individuals who were deported Thursday had
been held at the base’s migrant facility, designed to hold nonviolent
individuals.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the commander of U.S. Southern Command, which
oversees operations at the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, told lawmakers
that the base’s migrant facility had the capacity to hold about 2,500
nonviolent detainees. Efforts are under way to allow it to house as many
as 30,000 nonviolent migrants slated for deportation.</p>
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union, along with several immigration
rights groups, earlier this month filed a lawsuit against DHS, alleging
the detainees held at the Guantanamo Bay prison facility before being
deported had been improperly denied access to lawyers.</p>
<p>DHS dismissed the lawsuit’s allegations.</p>

id="trump-administration-proposes-steep-fees-on-chinese-cargo-ships">Trump
administration proposes steep fees on Chinese cargo ships</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Trump administration has proposed punitive new fees on
international shipping that would target vessels owned by Chinese
companies or manufactured in Chinese shipyards, promising to
dramatically alter the economics of global trade.</p>
<p>The new policy would charge Chinese-owned cargo ships, as well as
third-country flagged vessels built in China, $1 million or more per
port-of-call in the U.S.</p>
<p>Large container ships often make multiple stops when delivering goods
to the U.S., and would face new fees at each port.</p>
<p>The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) published the
proposal Friday, tying it to an investigation into allegations by
several U.S. labor unions that China has unfairly distorted the
international shipbuilding industry.</p>
<p>The investigation, conducted under Section 301 of the Trade Act of
1974, determined that the Chinese government has pursued a policy of
subsidizing its domestic shipbuilding industry with the aim of
“targeting for dominance” the global market.</p>
<p>Growing market share</p>
<p>The investigation pointed out that over the past 25 years, China’s
share of the global shipbuilding industry has exploded. China accounted
for about 5% of the total tonnage of ships manufactured in 1999. By
2023, the Chinese share of the market surpassed 50%.</p>
<p>The USTR found that Chinese policy “burdens or restricts U.S.
commerce by undercutting business opportunities for and investments in
the U.S. maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors; restricting
competition and choice; creating economic security risks from dependence
and vulnerabilities in sectors critical to the functioning of the U.S.
economy; and undermining supply chain resilience.”</p>
<p>The results of the investigation, which began during President Joe
Biden’s administration, were announced last month.</p>
<p>The proposal is open for public comment until March 24, at which
point the administration will determine whether or not to implement
it.</p>
<p>Chinese reaction</p>
<p>On Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian sharply
criticized the U.S. move.</p>
<p>“[T]o serve its political agenda at home, the U.S. has abused Section
301 investigation[s], which seriously violated WTO [World Trade
Organization] rules and further undermined the multilateral trading
system,” he said. “We call on the U.S. side to respect facts and
multilateral rules and immediately stop its wrongdoings.”</p>
<p>The China Association of the National Shipbuilding Industry (CANSI)
and China Shipowner Association had previously blasted the USTR
investigation as being “conclusions full of lies and distortion of
facts.”</p>
<p>In a statement issued when the results of the investigation were
released, CANSI said, “Development of China’s shipbuilding industry
strictly follows the international trading rules and is the result of
collaboration with global partners, as well as the tech innovation, and
the hard-wording and excellent performances of Chinese industry
players.”</p>
<p>Complex new rules</p>
<p>The USTR proposal contains a number of complicated elements that made
it unclear precisely how any new regime of port fees would be
administered.</p>
<p>Each ship owned by a Chinese entity would be charged a $1 million fee
on entering a U.S. port, though the proposal also appears to consider a
different fee calculation of $1,000 per ton of capacity, which could add
up to considerably more for large ships that carry thousands of tons of
cargo.</p>
<p>Chinese-built ships operated by non-Chinese shipowners would be
subject to a $1.5 million fee, which could be adjusted, depending on the
percentage of Chinese-built ships in that shipowner’s fleet. This would
apply even if the ship’s cargo was not manufactured in China.</p>
<p>Ships owned by companies that have existing orders for new ships
pending with Chinese shipbuilders could be hit with an additional $1
million fee per entry at U.S. ports.</p>
<p>The rule also provides for “refunds” of a similar amount each time a
shipping company sends a U.S.-built cargo ship into a U.S. port.</p>
<p>Economic justifications hazy</p>
<p>Mary Lovely, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for
International Economics, said it was difficult to find an economic
justification for the proposal.</p>
<p>“The thing that’s really disturbing is that it’s not linked to any
particular policy that would benefit American businesses or consumers,”
she said.</p>
<p>International trade will continue to flow to the United States, but
through more convoluted routes that add time and expense. For example,
Lovely predicted that many shipping firms would explore the possibility
of diverting their ships to ports in Mexico and Canada, and trucking the
cargo into the U.S.</p>
<p>“It seems to me that this is just a tremendous way to reduce volume
and employment at U.S. ports and basically force trade to take
transportation routes and transportation modes that are clearly going to
raise prices for U.S. businesses and consumers,” Lovely said. “There’s
no way around it.”</p>
<p>In an email exchange with VOA, Joe Kramek, World Shipping Council
president and CEO, echoed those concerns.</p>
<p>“USTR’s proposed draconian $1 million-plus per U.S. port visit fees
on ships that carry the large majority of the U.S. trade, if they are
Chinese-built or –operated – or on any ship operator from any country
that has even a single Chinese ship in its fleet or on order – if
carried forward, would cause broad economic harm across all sectors of
the U.S. supply chain,” wrote Kramek, whose organization represents
shipping companies.</p>
<p>“The fees would result in fewer U.S. port calls, higher prices for
U.S. consumers, and severe impacts for exporters, particularly American
farmers,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Unlikely to benefit US shipbuilders</p>
<p>Though ostensibly aimed at helping U.S. shipbuilders, the law is
unlikely to have a significant impact on that industry, said Marc
Levinson, a Washington-based economist and historian who has written two
books about container shipping.</p>
<p>“This is not likely to do much for U.S. shipbuilding,” Levinson told
VOA. “U.S. commercial shipbuilders are very far away from global scale.
They don’t produce anything that is competitive on the international
market for commercial oceangoing vessels.”</p>
<p>“The winners of this policy would be Japan, Korea, the Philippines,
other countries where commercial shipbuilding is on a larger scale today
than the United States,” Levinson said. The losers, he added, will
include U.S. consumers, as the port fees are passed on in the form of
higher prices for imported goods.</p>
<p>In an email exchange with VOA, the National Retail Federation
registered its opposition to the policy, writing, “NRF strongly opposes
a port fee remedy, which will do nothing to force China to change its
behavior and practices. It will only increase shipping costs for
retailers and further disrupt the maritime market.”</p>

<h2
id="trump-says-canada-mexico-tariffs-on-schedule-despite-border-fentanyl-efforts">Trump
says Canada, Mexico tariffs on schedule despite border, fentanyl
efforts</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said on Monday that tariffs on
Canadian and Mexican imports are “on time and on schedule” despite
efforts by the countries to beef up border security and halt the flow of
fentanyl into the U.S. ahead of a March 4 deadline.</p>
<p>“The tariffs are going forward on time, on schedule,” Trump told a
joint news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron. He had been
asked whether Canada and Mexico had done enough to avoid the punishing
25% U.S. duties.</p>
<p>Many had hoped the top two U.S. trading partners could persuade
Trump’s administration to further delay tariffs that would apply to over
$918 billion worth of U.S. imports from the two countries, from autos to
energy. This could wreak havoc on the integrated North American economy,
with the automotive sector hit particularly hard.</p>
<p>Trump did not specifically mention the March 4 deadline. He later
referred to his desire for “reciprocal” tariffs to match the duty rates
and offset the trade barriers of all countries, including France.</p>
<p>Trump and Macron did not publicly discuss another sticking point –
digital services taxes imposed by France, Canada and other countries
aimed at dominant U.S. tech giants including Google, Facebook and
Amazon.</p>
<p>On Friday, Trump ordered his administration to revive tariff
investigations into countries that levy digital service taxes on U.S.
firms.</p>
<p>Border hopes dimmed</p>
<p>Canada and Mexico have taken steps to beef up border security, which
bought them about a month’s reprieve from Trump’s earlier Feb. 1
deadline to impose the tariffs, based on a national emergency
declaration.</p>
<p>Any further delay negotiated ahead of the deadline will keep the
tariff threat in place at least until clear evidence emerges that
Canadian and Mexican measures are working, said Dan Ujczo, a lawyer
specializing in U.S.-Canada trade matters.</p>
<p>“There’s progress being made on the security front,” said Ujczo,
senior counsel with Thompson Hine in Columbus, Ohio. “But it’s overly
optimistic to think that those tariffs would be fully rescinded.”</p>
<p>The White House, U.S. Trade Representative’s office and Commerce
Department did not respond to requests for comment on negotiations
expected this week ahead of the March 4 deadline.</p>
<p>More tariff threats</p>
<p>Since Trump’s initial 25% tariff threat and imposition of a 10% duty
on all Chinese imports, he has heaped on more tariff actions that could
muddy the waters on border negotiations.</p>
<p>These include substantially raising tariffs on steel and aluminum to
a flat 25%, rescinding longstanding exemptions for Canada and Mexico,
the largest sources of U.S. imports of the metals. These steep
increases, which also extend to hundreds of downstream steel products,
are due to take effect a week after the border tariffs, on March 12.</p>
<p>Trump has also said he wants to impose 25% tariffs on imports of
autos, pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, and to match duty rates and
trade barriers of other countries.</p>
<p>The threatened tariffs could kick off an early launch of a
renegotiation of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement on trade that is due
by 2026, Ujczo added.</p>
<p>Trump signed the USMCA into law in 2020 after renegotiating the 1994
North American Free Trade Agreement but has increasingly expressed
dissatisfaction with imports of autos from Mexico and Canada.</p>
<p>Progress cited</p>
<p>On Thursday, Mexican Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Thursday
he had a “constructive dialog” during a meeting with Trump’s top trade
officials.</p>
<p>Ebrard said in a post on X that the “joint work” on U.S. trade
matters starts on Monday.</p>
<p>Mexico has begun deploying as many as 10,000 national guard troops to
its northern border, as part of the agreement that Mexican President
Claudia Sheinbaum said also called on the U.S. to work to stop the flow
of firearms into Mexico.</p>
<p>Canada this month created a new fentanyl czar to coordinate the fight
against smuggling of the deadly opioid, appointing senior intelligence
official Kevin Brosseau to the post.</p>
<p>Ottawa also has reclassified drug cartels as terrorist entities and
has deployed drones, helicopters and other surveillance technologies on
the vast northern U.S. border.</p>
<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has kept in close contact with
Trump on the border issues in recent days, including in a Saturday call
that included discussions of joint efforts to curb fentanyl trade. He
has threatened retaliatory tariffs on $107 billion of U.S. imports,
including American beer, wine and bourbon and Florida orange juice, but
said last week that Canada is “going to do the work” to ensure that
tariffs are not imposed.</p>

<h2 id="trump-hosts-french-leader-to-discuss-ukraine-endgame-1">Trump
hosts French leader to discuss Ukraine endgame</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>President Donald Trump said Monday he’s nearing a deal with Ukraine
and with Russia to end the war in Ukraine after a packed day of meetings
at the White House with French President Emmanuel Macron.</p>
<p>Trump urged Europe to take a bigger role in funding, and Paris pushed
for more assurances from Moscow.</p>
<p>The U.S. president pushed his desire for a deal to end the war, which
struck its grim third anniversary Monday. He has said this will include
an agreement with Ukraine for its critical minerals — a deal he hinted
could be signed as soon as next week by Ukraine’s president.</p>
<p>“There’s tremendous distrust on both sides,” Trump said. “That’s why
it’s good that I’m coming in now. But I think it’s to the very much
benefit of Russia to make a deal and to go on with leading Russia in a
very positive way. That’s what you have to do. But I really believe that
he wants to make a deal. I may be wrong, but I believe he wants to make
a deal.”</p>
<p>Macron was more circumspect, correcting Trump in the Oval Office when
Trump said Europe supported Ukraine with a loan. Macron then warned
against trusting Moscow.</p>
<p>“Let’s try to get something first which … can be assessed, checked
and verified,” he said in English. “And let’s be sure that we build
sufficient guarantees in the short run. And this is where we are ready
to be engaged. As for France, a lot of my European colleagues are ready
to be engaged. But we do need this American backup, because this is part
of the credibility of the security guarantees. And this is our
collective deterrence capacity. And I have the feeling that the
president has this capacity.”</p>
<p>Analysts spoke of what the two leaders accomplished in their
meetings.</p>
<p>“It looks like they agreed to have European peacekeepers enforce the
peace between Russia and Ukraine,” said William Pomeranz, a senior
scholar at the Wilson Center Kennan Institute. “There are a lot of other
side issues that I haven’t really been able to get a hold of, but yes,
there are attempts to have a peace agreement and a use of peacekeepers
to enforce the agreement between Russia and Ukraine.”</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed hope and emphasized
the importance of Washington’s role.</p>
<p>“Our teams are already working productively with the U.S. on an
economic agreement, which we hope to sign in Washington,” he said in
English. “And President Trump, we would really like to hear from you,
because all our people, all our families, are very worried: ‘Will there
be support from America? Will America be the leader of the free world?’
And I want to be very honest, very honest with you: For our people, for
life in general, it is so important that American support, American
assistance remains.”</p>
<p>But other world leaders expressed concerns that Ukraine was kept out
of high-level discussions in Saudi Arabia between Washington and Moscow.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who recently met with Zelenskyy
in Ankara, also said Russia hasn’t always been part of the process.</p>
<p>“Apart from the Istanbul process, Russia has been excluded from the
tables established so far, and therefore the desired result has not been
achieved,” Erdogan said. “If results are to be obtained from the new
process, Ukraine must definitely be included in the process, and this
war must be ended through mutual negotiations.”</p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said that so far, talks have not
been specific.</p>
<p>“During the phone conversation and at the meeting in Riyadh, we
certainly touched on issues related to the Ukrainian crisis,” he said.
“However, it was not discussed in essence. We only agreed that we would
approach it. That being said, of course, we are not rejecting the
participation of European countries.”</p>
<p>Some analysts warn that Trump’s idea of a deal is not advantageous to
Ukraine.</p>
<p>“We have to see this as a move by Donald Trump to undermine the
legitimacy of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy — and in the worst
case, as Trump advocating for Russia’s position, which has been in the
past that elections have to be part of a negotiation process in Ukraine,
although it’s an entirely Ukrainian domestic issue,” said Liana Fix, a
fellow for Europe at the Council on Foreign Relations.</p>
<p>“So, it’s not only a back and forth between Trump and Zelenskyy. We
do see a broader realignment here of U.S. policy towards a normalization
of relations with Russia, where Ukraine is perceived as a problem to
this normalization,” she said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Europe, as Ukraine somberly marked Monday as the third
anniversary of the war, Paris’ most famous icon, the Eiffel Tower,
burned brightly in the yellow and blue colors of the Ukrainian flag.</p>

<h2 id="top-us-general-in-asia-begins-2-day-visit-to-cambodia">Top US
general in Asia begins 2-day visit to Cambodia</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The top U.S. Army officer for the Asia-Pacific region began a two-day
visit to Cambodia Monday in a trip designed to expand and improve frayed
ties between the two nations.</p>
<p>General Ronald P. Clark, the commanding general of the United States
Army Pacific met with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and senior
Cambodian military officials in Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>Ties between the U.S. and Cambodia have been strained with
Washington’s criticism of Cambodia’s political repression and human
rights violations.</p>
<p>However, the U.S. and other countries are also greatly concerned with
Cambodia’s close ties with China. Of special interest is China’s access
to the Ream Naval Base near the disputed South China Sea, a waterway
China claims almost in full.</p>
<p>In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague rejected China’s
sweeping claims. The naval base is strategically located in the Gulf of
Thailand, which borders the western section of the South China Sea. The
base’s renovation was funded by China.</p>
<p>China has contributed massive amounts of money to Cambodia’s updating
of its infrastructure with the help beginning when the prime minister’s
father, Hun Sen, was leading the country.</p>
<p>That funding continues and later Monday, Manet met with Yin LI, a
member of the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party, according to a
post on the prime minister’s Telegram account.</p>
<p>The post said the Li praised the progress on “all cooperation in all
fields” between Cambodia and China.</p>
<p>During the meeting, Clark also expressed his admiration for Cambodia
for sending U.N. peacekeepers to several international locations,
according to the prime minister’s office.</p>
<p>The prime minister also thanked the U.S. for its assistance in
helping to clear explosives from Cambodia after years of war that left
Cambodia in the late 1990s with 4 million to 6 million land mines and
other unexploded ordnance, including unexploded U.S. bombs.</p>
<p>Clark also met Monday with General Mao Sophan, Cambodia’s military
chief.</p>
<p>The two military generals had “constructive discussions,” the army
said in a statement. Topics of their talks included defense, trade,
tourism, counterterrorism, peacekeeping and demining, the Cambodian army
said.</p>
<p>Their discussion also included the possible revival of the Angkor
Sentinel exercise, the joint military exercises previously held by the
U.S. and Cambodia that were abandoned nearly 10 years ago, the army
said.</p>

France-Presse.</p>

<h2 id="us-lawmakers-rush-to-avoid-march-14-government-shutdown">US
lawmakers rush to avoid March 14 government shutdown</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. lawmakers are one step closer to funding the government past a
March 14 deadline, but Congress still has serious issues to resolve as
they come back to work in the nation’s capital this week. </p>
<p>At question is how and when to enact a proposed extension of the 2017
tax cuts and how to pay down the U.S. deficit without cutting key safety
net programs that help American voters. </p>
<p>President Donald Trump has called for lawmakers to pass “one big,
beautiful bill” that will be a key part of enacting his domestic policy
agenda.  </p>
<p>Despite Trump expressing his preference for the House of
Representatives version of the budget, the Senate passed a funding
resolution Friday that provides $150 billion in military funding and
$175 billion for border security. That measure also avoids the
controversial Medicaid cuts in the House version.  </p>
<p>Senate leadership has proposed passing the tax cuts in a separate
bill later this year. </p>
<p>“Republicans are moving forward on legislation to fund continued
efforts to deport criminal aliens, as well as provide other necessary
resources to secure our border, discourage illegal immigration and
restore respect for the rule of law,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune
said Monday on the Senate floor. </p>
<p>But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer characterized the vote as a
first step toward extending the tax cuts. </p>
<p>“What are Republicans doing? They’re spending precious time trying to
cater to the wishes of the absolutely richest people in America, instead
of working to avoid a disastrous halt of services that help tens of
millions of middle-class American families,” Schumer said Monday.</p>
<p>The Senate moved forward with a vote on its version of the budget due
to uncertainty over the potential success of the vote on the House
version. The two versions will have to be compromised to be signed into
law.  </p>
<p>The House is set to hold a procedural vote on Tuesday, but Speaker of
the House Mike Johnson holds a slim Republican majority and cannot
afford to lose any members of his own to pass his version of the
budget. </p>
<p>Republican Representative Tony Gonzales led a group of seven other
House Republicans warning against potential cuts to health care program
Medicaid, food assistance funding and other social safety net
programs. </p>
<p>“Slashing Medicaid would have serious consequences, particularly in
rural and predominantly Hispanic communities where hospitals and nursing
homes are already struggling to keep their doors open,” the lawmakers
said in a letter to Johnson sent last week. </p>
<p>Republican Representative Thomas Massie, a member of the conservative
Freedom Caucus, also expressed concern about the version of the budget
up for a vote, along with several other undecided House Republicans who
have not yet announced their votes on the measure. </p>
<p>Congressional Democrats also object to the Republican tax cut
proposal, arguing it will harm lower-income and middle-class Americans
who are already concerned about the cost of living and inflation. </p>
<p>In a “Dear Colleagues” letter sent Monday morning, Democratic Leader
Hakeem Jeffries wrote, “Far-right extremists are determined to push
through $4.5 trillion of tax breaks for wealthy Republican donors and
well-connected corporations, explode the debt and saddle everyday
Americans with the bill by ending Medicaid as we know it. We must be at
full strength to enhance our opportunity to stop the GOP Tax Scam in its
tracks.” </p>
<p>Trump posted on Truth Social last week that “The House and Senate are
doing a SPECTACULAR job of working together as one unified, and
unbeatable, TEAM, however, unlike the Lindsey Graham version of the very
important Legislation currently being discussed, the House Resolution
implements my FULL America First Agenda, EVERYTHING, not just parts of
it!” </p>
<p>If lawmakers cannot reach a compromise by March 14, there will be a
partial government shutdown, leaving millions of federal employees
temporarily without pay and suspending some non-essential government
services.</p>

eyes Trump’s Ukraine strategy, strengthens ties with Russia</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>STATE DEPARTMENT — Three years into Russia’s aggression in Ukraine,
China is closely monitoring U.S. President Donald Trump’s strategy to
end the war, as Beijing calculates its moves to position itself as a
strategic partner for Ukraine while maintaining a no‐limits partnership
with Russia, according to experts and former officials. </p>
<p>This week, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President
Emmanuel Macron are set to hold in-person meetings in Washington,
following the Feb. 18 direct talks between senior U.S. and Russian
officials in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. </p>
<p>Macron met with Trump Monday morning at the White House for a meeting
that lasted nearly two hours. Both leaders participated in a
videoconference with other G7 leaders about Ukraine.  </p>
<p>Earlier on Monday, Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke with Russian
President Vladimir Putin, who updated Xi on the Riyadh talks and
reaffirmed the “comprehensive strategic partnership” between Russia and
China. A Chinese readout said, “China welcomes the positive efforts made
by Russia and relevant parties to resolve the crisis.” </p>
<p>‘Crisis’ but not war </p>
<p>For three years, Chinese officials have said Beijing will “play a
constructive role” in the “political settlement of the crisis,”
refraining from using the term “Ukraine war” to describe Russia’s
aggression since Feb. 24, 2022. </p>
<p>Beijing also commended the recent U.S.-Russia talks, during which
Ukraine was not present. </p>
<p>China and Ukraine “established a strategic partnership in 2011. … In
recent years, China has been Ukraine’s largest trading partner,” Chinese
Foreign Minister Wang Yi told Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha
on Feb. 15 on the margins of the Munich Security Conference. </p>
<p>“Regarding the Ukrainian crisis … China has always worked for peace
and promoted talks,” Wang said. Notably, the Chinese readout of the
meeting made no mention of Ukraine’s sovereignty or territorial
integrity. </p>
<p>On Feb. 20, two days after the U.S.-Russia talks, Wang held in-person
discussions with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at the G20
ministerial meeting in Johannesburg, South Africa, where Lavrov briefed
him on the Riyadh talks. Wang reaffirmed China’s “comprehensive
strategic partnership” with Russia. </p>
<p>Wang said China “supports” all efforts dedicated to peace, including
“the recent consensus reached between the United States and Russia” in
Riyadh. </p>
<p>Talks, not negotiations </p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the Riyadh talks — the first
between Washington and Moscow in years — were not negotiations aimed at
striking any deal on Ukraine, despite concerns from Ukraine and European
countries that they were being sidelined.  </p>
<p>He said the talks were intended to determine whether the Russians
were serious about ending the war.  </p>
<p>In a measured tone, Rubio characterized the talks — which lasted for
more than four hours — as steps toward establishing “lines of
communication” on bilateral issues between the United States and Russia.
Among these efforts is the goal of achieving “some normalcy in our
missions and their ability to function.” </p>
<p>Some analysts said Beijing is nervous over a reset of U.S.-Russia
ties.   </p>
<p>“While a complete rapprochement might not be in the cards, they’re
nervous because if Trump lifts sanctions on Russia, then Moscow’s
dependency on China decreases,” Dennis Wilder, who was a top White House
China adviser to former U.S. President George W. Bush, told
RFE/RL.  </p>
<p>But others warned that the U.S. risked bolstering China’s global
information campaign, which portrays Washington as an unreliable
ally. </p>
<p>Retired Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery, a defense analyst at the
Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), said, “We
immediately gave away what leverage we had” and “misattributed who the
aggressor was” while rushing into talks with the Russians. </p>
<p>China, “stumbling into this good news,” certainly gets the benefit,
Montgomery said in a recent webinar hosted by FDD.  </p>
<p>“I have no doubt that diplomats from China are whispering in ears
around the world about the unreliability of Americans, and
unfortunately, this administration is giving them some talking points,”
Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political
Power at the FDD, said during the webinar. </p>
<p>Experts skeptical </p>
<p>A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson declined to comment on
whether China would consider sending peacekeeping forces to Ukraine
after the conflict ends.</p>
<p>Xi and Putin are scheduled to exchange visits to Moscow and Beijing
later this year. The two held a virtual meeting on Jan. 21.
Additionally, Xi took a phone call from Putin on the afternoon of
Feb. 24. </p>
<p>Some former U.S. officials are skeptical about the extent to which
the Chinese government is genuinely willing to act to stop Russia’s war
on Ukraine. They believe China may use the issue as leverage in its
dealings with Trump. </p>
<p>“I think the Chinese will look at the Ukraine issue, and they will
offer some help to Trump. They probably won’t do very much, and then
they will claim success,” Evan Medeiros, director of Georgetown
University’s Asian Studies program, said during a recent podcast with
the German Marshall Fund’s Indo-Pacific program. Medeiros served on the
White House National Security Council from 2009 to 2015. </p>
<p>“Anything that is in their direct material interests, like helping to
rebuild Ukraine, they will embrace. But of course, that doesn’t have to
do with encouraging Russia to reach a peace deal. That’s about ensuring
that Chinese infrastructure companies get lots of big fat contracts,”
Medeiros added.</p>

Supreme Court rebuffs free speech challenge to abortion clinic buffer
zones</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court declined Monday to hear a
challenge to the legality of buffer zones used to protect access to
abortion clinics and limit harassment of patients in a challenge brought
by anti-abortion activists who have argued that their free speech rights
were being violated.</p>
<p>The justices turned away appeals by self-described “sidewalk
counselors” in New Jersey and Illinois of lower court decisions to throw
out their lawsuits that had claimed that the buffer zones violate free
speech protections under the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment. The
activists had been asking the Supreme Court to overturn its 2000 ruling
allowing a Colorado buffer zone law.</p>
<p>Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito said they
would have taken up the appeals.</p>
<p>The legality of so-called buffer zones that create a perimeter around
abortion facilities, or “floating” zones that put distance between
demonstrators and a clinic’s patients or staff, has been legally
contested for decades. The issue pits free speech rights against
concerns over harassment and violence by anti-abortion protesters.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has a 6-3 conservative majority. In 2022, the court
overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that had legalized abortion
nationwide, ending its recognition of a woman’s constitutional right to
terminate her pregnancy. Since that ruling, the issue of buffer zones
has regained prominence.</p>
<p>While numerous Republican-led states have banned or severely
restricted abortion, some municipalities in states where it remains
legal have adopted buffer zone ordinances to limit intimidation and
harassment, drawing legal challenges.</p>
<p>In Carbondale, Illinois, a group called Coalition Life that organizes
sidewalk counselors sued after the local city council passed such an
ordinance in 2023. The measure established a floating 8-foot (2.4
meters) buffer that prevents people from approaching people without
their permission in the vicinity of health care facilities, in response
to increased threats and disorderly acts at abortion clinics. The
ordinance has since been repealed.</p>
<p>It had been modeled after a nearly identical Colorado law that the
Supreme Court upheld in 2000 in a case called Hill v. Colorado.</p>
<p>The Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the
coalition’s case in March 2024, noting that the challengers cannot
prevail so long as the Hill ruling remains in place.</p>
<p>Thomas, in his dissent on Monday, criticized the court’s Hill
decision and expressed regret that the justices had declined “an
invitation to set the record straight on Hill’s defunct status.”</p>
<p>“I would have taken this opportunity to explicitly overrule Hill,”
Thomas added.</p>
<p>The coalition’s lawyers had asked the Supreme Court to overrule the
Hill ruling because in places where “anti-abortion views are
disfavored,” buffer zones are a “ready tool to try to silence those who
advance them — and to do so precisely when and where their speech may
matter most.”</p>
<p>In New Jersey, a sidewalk counselor named Jeryl Turco sued the city
of Englewood for adopting a 2014 ordinance that created an 8-foot buffer
zone protecting the entrances and driveways of healthcare
facilities.</p>
<p>The buffer was set after reports of people associated with an
evangelical Christian ministry engaging in aggressive and hostile
protests outside Metropolitan Medical Associates, a local abortion
clinic. Turco was not associated with the ministry, and said she
delivered only peaceful counseling.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out
Turco’s complaint in January 2024, saying a buffer zone can help protect
an individual’s health, safety and access to pregnancy-related services,
and “does not place a substantial burden on Turco’s speech.” The 3rd
Circuit said its ruling was in line with the Hill precedent.</p>
<p>Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood
Federation of America, said after the Supreme Court acted on Monday that
buffer zones “help to create a safer environment for patients, providers
and staff.”</p>
<p>“No patient should have to encounter threats, intimidation and
attacks while seeking health care — and no medical provider or health
center staff should be threatened because of their work to deliver
abortion care to patients in need,” Johnson said.</p>

<p>After devastating wildfires tore through Los Angeles, the 97th
Academy Awards are going forward. </p>
<p>Like the Grammys and other awards shows this year, the ceremony will
be transformed by the fires and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences has pledged to help its members and the broader film community
recover. </p>
<p>Here’s everything you need to know about this year’s show: </p>
<p>When are the Oscars? </p>
<p>The Academy Awards will be held March 2, at the Dolby Theater in Los
Angeles. The show, to be broadcast live by ABC, is scheduled to begin at
7 p.m. Eastern/4 p.m. Pacific. </p>
<p>Who’s hosting the Oscars? </p>
<p>Conan O’Brien is hosting the Academy Awards for the first time.
O’Brien, the late-night host turned podcaster and occasional movie star,
said upon the announcement: “America demanded it and now it’s happening:
Taco Bell’s new Cheesy Chalupa Supreme. In other news, I’m hosting the
Oscars.” </p>
<p>How have the wildfires altered the show? </p>
<p>The wildfires that consumed large parts of Los Angeles in early
January led some to call for the cancellation of the Academy Awards. The
academy twice postponed the announcement of nominations but never pushed
the March 2 date of the ceremony. Academy leaders have argued the show
must go ahead, for its economic impact on Los Angeles and as a symbol of
resilience. </p>
<p>Organizers have vowed this year’s awards will “celebrate the work
that unites us as a global film community and acknowledge those who
fought so bravely against the wildfires.” </p>
<p>Still, the fires have curtailed much of the usual frothiness of
Hollywood’s awards season. The film academy canceled its annual
nominees’ luncheon. </p>
<p>For many involved in the Oscars, the fires have been felt acutely.
O’Brien’s Pacific Palisades home survived but his family has been unable
to go back to it. O’Brien’s assistant and podcast co-host Sona Movsesian
lost her home. </p>
<p>“I know so many people who lost their homes and I’m just, was
ridiculously lucky,” O’Brien told The Associated Press. “So, we want to
make sure that that show reflects what’s happening and that we put a
light on the right people in the right way.” </p>
<p>Who’s presenting at the Oscars? </p>
<p>More stars were added to the presenter lineup last week, including
Selena Gomez, Oprah Winfrey, Joe Alwyn, Goldie Hawn, Ben Stiller, Ana de
Armas, Sterling K. Brown, Willem Dafoe, Lily-Rose Depp and Connie
Nielsen. They’ll join the likes of Halle Berry, Penelope Cruz, Elle
Fanning, Whoopi Goldberg, Scarlett Johansson, John Lithgow, Amy Poehler,
June Squibb and Bowen Yang, as well as last year’s acting winners — Emma
Stone, Robert Downey Jr., Cillian Murphy, Da’Vine Joy Randolph — on the
Oscar stage.</p>
<p>Though the academy initially said it would bring back the “fab five”
style of presenting the acting awards, with five previous winners per
category, organizers have reportedly abandoned those plans for this
year’s ceremony. Nick Offerman will also be participating as the Oscars
announcer. </p>
<p>Will there be any performances? </p>
<p>The academy has announced that, unlike previous years, the original
song nominees will not be performed this time. That doesn’t mean there
won’t be music, though. </p>
<p>Doja Cat, LISA of Blackpink, Queen Latifah and RAYE will be part of
“showstopping performances celebrating the filmmaking community and some
of its legends,” producers announced Monday, as will Wicked’s Cynthia
Erivo and Ariana Grande. (The songs from Wicked weren’t eligible for
best song since, hailing from the Broadway musical, they aren’t original
to the movie.) The Los Angeles Master Chorale will also appear. </p>
<p>What’s nominated for best picture? </p>
<p>The 10 nominees for best picture are: Anora, The Brutalist, A
Complete Unknown, Conclave, Dune: Part 2, Emilia Perez, I’m Still Here,
Nickel Boys, The Substance, and Wicked. </p>
<p>How to watch Oscar-nominated films? </p>
<p>Some of the nominees are still in theaters, but many of this year’s
Oscar nominees are streaming on various platforms.  </p>
<p>Who are the favorites? </p>
<p>More than most years, that’s a tricky question, but a front-runner
had emerged after Anora took the top awards at the Producers Guild,
Directors Guild and Independent Spirit Awards. The best picture race had
been seen as unusually wide open, with Anora, Conclave, The Brutalist, A
Complete Unknown and Emilia Perez all having legitimate hopes of winning
— the hopes of Conclave further boosted by its Screen Actors Guild
ensemble win. </p>
<p>In the acting categories, Demi Moore (The Substance) is favored for
best actress, although Mikey Madison’s BAFTA and Independent Spirit wins
for Anora makes it more of a race. Adrien Brody (The Brutalist) is most
likely in best actor — though SAG winner Timothee Chalamet could
threaten — while Zoe Saldana (Emilia Perez) is the supporting actress
front-runner and Kieran Culkin (A Real Pain) is the favorite for best
supporting actor. None of those awards, however, is considered a
definite lock. </p>
<p>What’s the deal with ‘Emilia Perez’? </p>
<p>Jacques Audiard’s Emilia Perez, a narco-musical about a Mexican drug
lord who undergoes gender-affirming surgery, comes in with a leading 13
nominations. The film, at one point, seemed like Netflix’s best chance
yet to land the streamer its first best picture win. Its star, Karla
Sofia Gascon, made history by becoming the first openly trans actor
nominated for an Oscar. </p>
<p>But no nominee has had a rockier post-nominations Oscar campaign.
After old offensive tweets by Gascon were uncovered, the actress issued
an apology. The fallout, though, has badly damaged a movie that was
already a divisive contender, and led Netflix to radically refocus its
flagging campaign.</p>

id="us-judge-allows-trumps-ap-oval-office-ban-to-stand-over-use-of-gulf-of-mexico-name">US
judge allows Trump’s AP Oval Office ban to stand over use of ‘Gulf of
Mexico’ name</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Monday denied a request by the
Associated Press to immediately restore full access for the news
agency’s journalists after President Donald Trump’s White House barred
them for continuing to refer to the Gulf of Mexico in coverage.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee, denied the
AP’s request for a temporary injunction restoring its access to the Oval
Office, Air Force One and events held at the White House.</p>
<p>McFadden said the restriction on “more private areas” used by the
president was different from prior instances in which courts have
blocked government officials from revoking access to journalists.</p>
<p>“I can’t say the AP has shown a likelihood of success here,” McFadden
said during a court hearing.</p>
<p>The judge set an expedited schedule to consider a longer-term order
in the case. McFadden said it appeared the White House had discriminated
against the AP based on its coverage choices.</p>
<p>“That does feel kind of problematic here,” he said.</p>
<p>After the ruling, the White House said in a statement that “asking
the President of the United States questions in the Oval Office and
aboard Air Force One is a privilege granted to journalists, not a legal
right.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the AP said the news agency will “continue to
stand for the right of the press and the public to speak freely without
government retaliation.”</p>
<p>The AP sued three senior Trump aides on Friday, arguing that the
decision to block its reporters from certain locations violates the U.S.
Constitution’s First Amendment protections against government abridgment
of speech by trying to dictate the language they use in reporting the
news.</p>
<p>“The Constitution prevents the president of the United States or any
other government official from coercing journalists or anyone else into
using official government vocabulary to report the news,” Charles Tobin,
a lawyer for the AP, said during a court hearing.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the Trump administration argued the AP does not have a
constitutional right to what they called “special media access to the
president.”</p>
<p>“They do not have a constitutional right to continue that access in
perpetuity,” said Brian Hudak, a Justice Department lawyer defending the
Trump officials.</p>
<p>The suit names three White House officials as defendants: Chief of
Staff Susan Wiles, Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich and White House
press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Leavitt last week said “we feel we are
in the right.” Wiles and Budowich did not respond to requests for
comment.</p>
<p>Trump signed an executive order last month directing the U.S.
Interior Department to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf
of America.</p>
<p>The AP said in January it would continue to use the gulf’s
long-established name in stories while also acknowledging Trump’s
efforts to change it.</p>
<p>The White House banned AP reporters in response. The ban prevents the
AP’s journalists from seeing and hearing Trump and other top White House
officials as they take newsworthy actions or respond in real time to
news events.</p>
<p>The White House Correspondents’ Association said in a legal brief
backing the AP in the case that the ban “will chill and distort news
coverage of the president to the public’s detriment.” Reuters released a
statement in support of the AP.</p>

id="clint-hill-agent-who-leaped-onto-jfks-car-after-president-was-shot-dies-at-93">Clint
Hill, agent who leaped onto JFK’s car after president was shot, dies at
93</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BELVEDERE, CALIFORNIA — Clint Hill, the Secret Service agent who
leaped onto the back of President John F. Kennedy’s limousine after the
president was shot, then was forced to retire early because he remained
haunted by memories of the assassination, has died. He was 93. </p>
<p>Hill died Friday at his home in Belvedere, California, according to
his publisher, Gallery Books, an imprint of Simon &amp; Schuster. A
cause of death was not given. </p>
<p>Although few may recognize his name, the footage of Hill, captured on
Abraham Zapruder’s chilling home movie of the assassination, provided
some of the most indelible images of Kennedy’s assassination in Dallas
on Nov. 22, 1963. </p>
<p>Hill received Secret Service awards and was promoted for his actions
that day, but for decades blamed himself for Kennedy’s death, saying he
didn’t react quickly enough and would gladly have given his life to save
the president. </p>
<p>“If I had reacted just a little bit quicker. And I could have, I
guess,” a weeping Hill told Mike Wallace on CBS’ 60 Minutes in 1975,
shortly after he retired at age 43 at the urging of his doctors. “And
I’ll live with that to my grave.” </p>
<p>It was only in recent years that Hill said he was able to finally
start putting the assassination behind him and accept what
happened. </p>
<p>On the day of the assassination, Hill was assigned to protect first
lady Jacqueline Kennedy and was riding on the left running board of the
follow-up car directly behind the presidential limousine as it made its
way through Dealey Plaza. </p>
<p>Hill told the Warren Commission that he reacted after hearing a shot
and seeing the president slump in his seat. The president was struck by
a fatal headshot before Hill was able to make it to the limousine. </p>
<p>Zapruder’s film captured Hill as he leaped from the Secret Service
car, grabbed a handle on the limousine’s trunk and pulled himself onto
it as the driver accelerated. He forced Mrs. Kennedy, who had crawled
onto the trunk, back into her seat as the limousine sped off. </p>
<p>Hill later became the agent in charge of the White House protective
detail and eventually an assistant director of the Secret Service,
retiring because of what he characterized as deep depression and
recurring memories of the assassination. </p>
<p>The 1993 Clint Eastwood thriller In the Line of Fire, about a former
Secret Service agent scarred by the JFK assassination, was inspired in
part by Hill. </p>
<p>Hill was born in 1932 and grew up in Washburn, North Dakota. He
attended Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, served in the Army
and worked as a railroad agent before joining the Secret Service in
1958. He worked in the agency’s Denver office for about a year, before
joining the elite group of agents assigned to protect the president and
first family. </p>
<p>Since his retirement, Hill has spoken publicly about the
assassination only a handful of times, but the most poignant was his
1975 interview with Wallace, during which Hill broke down several
times. </p>
<p>“If I had reacted about five-tenths of a second faster, maybe a
second faster, I wouldn’t be here today,” Hill said. </p>
<p>“You mean you would have gotten there, and you would have taken the
shot?” Wallace asked. </p>
<p>“The third shot, yes, sir,” Hill said. </p>
<p>“And that would have been all right with you?” </p>
<p>“That would have been fine with me,” Hill responded. </p>
<p>In his 2005 memoir, Between You and Me, Wallace recalled his
interview with Hill as one of the most moving of his career. </p>
<p>In 2006, Wallace and Hill reunited on CNN’s Larry King Live, where
Hill credited that first 60 Minutes interview with helping him finally
start the healing process. </p>
<p>“I have to thank Mike for asking me to do that interview and then
thank him more because he’s what caused me to finally come to terms with
things and bring the emotions out where they surfaced,” he said. “It was
because of his questions and the things he asked that I started to
recover.” </p>
<p>Decades after the assassination, Hill co-authored several books —
including Mrs. Kennedy and Me and Five Presidents — about his Secret
Service years with Lisa McCubbin Hill, whom he married in 2021. </p>
<p>“We had that once-in-a-lifetime love that everyone hopes for,”
McCubbin Hill said in a statement. “We were soulmates.” </p>
<p>Clint Hill also became a speaker and gave interviews about his
experience in Dallas. In 2018, he was given the state of North Dakota’s
highest civilian honor, the Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider Award. A
portrait of Hill adorns the Capitol gallery of fellow honorees. </p>
<p>A private funeral service will be held in Washington, D.C., on a
future date.</p>

id="roberta-flack-grammy-winning-singer-with-an-intimate-style-dies-at-88">Roberta
Flack, Grammy-winning singer with an intimate style, dies at 88</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Roberta Flack, the Grammy-winning singer and pianist whose
intimate vocal and musical style on Killing Me Softly with His Song, The
First Time Ever I Saw Your Face and other hits made her one of the top
recording artists of the 1970s and an influential performer long after,
died Monday. She was 88.</p>
<p>She died at home surrounded by her family, publicist Elaine Schock
said in a statement. Flack announced in 2022 she had ALS, commonly known
as Lou Gehrig’s disease, and could no longer sing,</p>
<p>Little known before her early 30s, Flack became an overnight star
after Clint Eastwood used The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face as the
soundtrack for one of cinema’s more memorable and explicit love scenes,
between the actor and Donna Mills in his 1971 film Play Misty for Me.
The hushed, hymn-like ballad, with Flack’s graceful soprano afloat on a
bed of soft strings and piano, topped the Billboard pop chart in 1972
and received a Grammy for record of the year. In 1973, she matched both
achievements with Killing Me Softly, becoming the first artist to win
consecutive Grammys for best record.</p>
<p>She was a classically trained pianist discovered in the late 1960s by
jazz musician Les McCann, who later wrote that “her voice touched,
tapped, trapped, and kicked every emotion I’ve ever known.” Versatile
enough to summon the up-tempo gospel passion of Aretha Franklin, Flack
often favored a more reflective and measured approach.</p>
<p>For Flack’s many admirers, she was a sophisticated and bold new
presence in the music world and in the social movements of the time, her
friends including the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Angela Davis, whom Flack
visited in prison while Davis faced charges — for which she was
acquitted — for murder and kidnapping. Flack sang at the funeral of
Jackie Robinson, major league baseball’s first Black player, and was
among the many guest performers on the feminist children’s entertainment
project created by Marlo Thomas, Free to Be … You and Me.</p>

<h2 id="apple-to-build-23200-square-meter-facility-in-texas">Apple to
build 23,200-square meter facility in Texas</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. tech giant Apple has announced plans to create some 20,000 jobs
and invest $500 billion over the next four years in the United
States. </p>
<p>Apple says it will expand teams and facilities in nine states across
the country and that it aims to open a 23,200-square-meter server
manufacturing facility in Texas in 2026. </p>
<p>The announcement comes just days after Apple CEO Tim Cook met with
U.S. President Donald Trump. </p>
<p>“We are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we’re proud
to build on our long-standing U.S. investments with this $500 billion
commitment to our country’s future,” Cook said on the investment. </p>
<p>“From doubling our Advanced Manufacturing Fund, to building advanced
technology in Texas, we’re thrilled to expand our support for American
manufacturing. And we’ll keep working with people and companies across
this country to help write an extraordinary new chapter in the history
of American innovation,” he added in a company statement. </p>
<p>Trump thanked Cook and Apple for the investment on Monday morning on
the social media platform Truth Social. </p>
<p>“Apple has just announced a record $500 billion investment in the
United States of America. The reason, faith in what we are doing,
without which, they wouldn’t be investing 10 cents,” Trump said. </p>
<p>Most of Apple’s consumer goods are currently assembled and produced
overseas. Many of them, assembled in China, are liable to 10% tariffs
imposed by Trump earlier in February. </p>
<p>To reduce its reliance on international supply chains, Apple
announced in January that it had begun mass producing its own chips at
an Arizona factory owned by TSMC, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Company. </p>

<h2 id="us-imposes-new-sanctions-on-irans-shadow-fleet">US imposes new
sanctions on Iran’s ‘shadow fleet’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The United States imposed sanctions on more than 30
people and vessels for their role in selling and transporting Iranian
petroleum-related products as part of Tehran’s “shadow fleet,” the
Treasury Department said. </p>
<p>The sanctions target oil brokers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
and Hong Kong, tanker operators and mangers in India and China, the head
of Iran’s National Iranian Oil Company, and the Iranian Oil Terminals
Company, Treasury said. </p>
<p>It said the vessels sanctioned ship tens of millions of barrels of
crude oil valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars, the department
said in a statement. </p>
<p>“Iran continues to rely on a shadowy network of vessels, shippers,
and brokers to facilitate its oil sales and fund its destabilizing
activities,” said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.  </p>
<p>The sanctions build on those imposed by the Biden
administration.  </p>
<p>Such sanctions target key sectors of Iran’s economy with the aim of
denying the government funds for its nuclear and missile programs. The
move generally prohibits any U.S. individuals or entities from doing any
business with the targets and freezes any U.S.-held assets.</p>

<h2 id="un-to-vote-on-russia-ukraine-war-resolutions">UN to vote on
Russia-Ukraine war resolutions</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A resolution drafted by the United States and another drafted by
Ukraine and backed by the European Union calling for an end to the war
in Ukraine are set for votes Monday at the United Nations.</p>
<p>The U.N. General Assembly is expected to vote on the Ukrainian
resolution, followed by the U.S. resolution. The U.N. Security Council
is expected to hold its own vote on the U.S. resolution later in the
day.</p>
<p>The U.S. resolution calls for “a swift end to the conflict and
further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and the Russian
Federation.”</p>
<p>The U.S.-drafted measure does not mention Russia’s full-scale
invasion of Ukraine, which began three years ago Monday.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Friday that the resolution
would “affirm that this conflict is awful, that the U.N. can help end
it, and that peace is possible.”</p>
<p>“This is our opportunity to build real momentum toward peace,” Rubio
said in a statement.</p>
<p>The more extensive Ukrainian resolution says the Russian invasion
“has persisted for three years and continues to have devastating and
long-lasting consequences not only for Ukraine, but also for other
regions and global stability.”</p>
<p>It calls for “a de-escalation, an early cessation of hostilities and
a peaceful resolution of the war against Ukraine” and highlights the
need for the war to end this year.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian draft says earlier resolutions adopted by the General
Assembly need to be fully implemented, including those calling for
Russia to fully withdraw from Ukraine’s internationally recognized
borders.</p>
<p>General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, but they do
carry the moral weight of the international community.</p>
<p>At the Security Council, a resolution needs the support of at least
nine of the 15 members, with none of the permanent members—Britain,
China, France, Russia, or United States—using their veto power. The U.S.
measure is expected to have enough support Monday.</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said during remarks Monday at
the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva that countries “must spare no
effort to bring an end to this conflict, and achieve a just and lasting
peace in line with the U.N. Charter, international law and General
Assembly resolutions.”</p>
<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia is ready to
negotiate with Ukraine and Europe, but will “stop hostilities only when
these negotiations produce a firm and sustainable result that suits the
Russian Federation.”</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron is visiting the United States for
talks Monday with President Donald Trump that are expected to include
the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Macron said last week that he planned to tell Trump the U.S. leader
“cannot be weak” in the face of Putin.</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is due to visit Washington later
this week for similar talks, and like Macron has emphasized the need for
Ukraine’s sovereignty to be at the center of any peace effort.</p>
<p>A group of leaders including European Commission President Ursula von
der Leyen, European Council President Antonio Costa, Canadian Prime
Minister Justin Trudeau, Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and
Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez visited Kyiv on Monday in a show of
support for Ukraine.</p>
<p>“We are in Kyiv today, because Ukraine is Europe,” von der Leyen said
on X. “In this fight for survival, it is not only the destiny of Ukraine
that is at stake. It’s Europe’s destiny.”</p>
<p>European Union foreign ministers on Monday approved a new round of
sanctions against Russia, which EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said
include measures against ships that work to evade restrictions on
transporting certain goods, banks that circumvent sanctions and
equipment used to pilot drones.</p>
<p>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the new sanctions “entirely
predictable,” and said the European nations seemed to want the war to
continue.</p>
<p>Fighting continued Monday with Russia saying it shot down 23
Ukrainian drones overnight, including 16 over the Oryol region.</p>
<p>Ryazan Governor Pavel Malkov said falling debris from a downed
Ukrainian drone caused a fire at an industrial enterprise.</p>
<p>Ukraine’s military said Monday it shot down 113 of the 185 drones
that Russia used in overnight attacks.</p>

<h2 id="trump-says-dan-bongino-to-be-fbi-deputy-director">Trump says Dan
Bongino to be FBI deputy director</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said in a post on social media
Sunday that Dan Bongino, a conservative talk show host, will be deputy
director of the FBI.</p>
<p>Bongino will join Kash Patel, who was recently confirmed by the
Senate as director of the FBI. Trump said Bongino was named to the role
by Patel. The position does not require Senate confirmation.</p>
<p>“Great news for Law Enforcement and American Justice!” Trump posted
on his social media network, Truth Social, calling Bongino “a man of
incredible love and passion for our Country.”</p>
<p>Bongino was previously a New York City police officer, and a member
of the U.S. Secret Service. He most recently had been known as a
conservative radio host and podcaster.</p>
<p>Trump said in his post that Bongino is “prepared to give up” his
program as he steps into the new role. “The Dan Bongino Show” was most
recently the 56th-ranked podcast in the United States, according to
Spotify.</p>

id="conclave-triumphs-at-sag-awards-timothee-chalamet-wins-best-actor-upending-oscar-predictions">‘Conclave’
triumphs at SAG Awards, Timothee Chalamet wins best actor, upending
Oscar predictions</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The papal thriller “Conclave” won best ensemble and Timothee Chalamet
took best actor at the 31st Screen Actors Guild Awards on Sunday, a pair
of twists that added a few final wrinkles to an unusually unpredictable
awards season.</p>
<p>In winning the guild’s top award, Edward Berger’s Vatican-set drama
triumphed just as the Catholic Church was praying for the health of Pope
Francis, who remained in critical condition Sunday after an asthmatic
respiratory crisis. “Conclave” dramatizes the fictional election of a
new pope. Earlier in the evening onstage, Isabella Rossellini shared the
cast’s best wishes for Pope Francis.</p>
<p>All the momentum going into the SAG Awards was with Sean Baker’s
“Anora,” which had won with the producers, directors and writers guilds.
Now, with “Conclave” winning with the actors and at the BAFTAs, what
will nab best picture in a week’s time at the Academy Awards is, again,
anyone’s guess.</p>
<p>“Wow,” said “Conclave” star Ralph Fiennes taking the stage. “I’ve not
been elected to speak. I’ve been designated to speak on behalf of our
conclave, our ensemble.”</p>
<p>That wasn’t the only surprise in the ceremony held at the Shrine
Auditorium in Los Angeles and streamed lived by Netflix. Chalamet’s best
actor win upset “The Brutalist” star Adrien Brody and put the
29-year-old on course to possibly win his first Academy Award.</p>
<p>Chalamet looked visibly surprised when his name was announced at the
ceremony. But once he reached the staged, the “A Complete Unknown” star
spoke with composure and confidence.</p>
<p>“The truth is, this was 5 ½ years of my life,” said Chalamet. “I
poured everything I had into playing this incomparable artist, Mr. Bob
Dylan, a true American hero. It was the honor of a lifetime playing
him.”</p>
<p>He then added: “The truth is, I’m really in pursuit of greatness. I
know people don’t usually talk like that, but I want to be one of the
greats.”</p>
<p>The other Oscar favorites — Demi Moore, Zoe Saldana and Kieran Culkin
— all won. The SAG Awards are closely watched as an Oscar preview. Their
picks don’t always align exactly with those of the film academy, but
they often nearly do.</p>
<p>The last three best ensemble winners — “Oppenheimer,” “Everything
Everywhere All at Once” and “CODA” — all went on to win best picture at
the Oscars. All but one of the SAG acting winners of the last three
years has also won the Oscar. (The sole exception was Lily Gladstone,
who won SAG’s award for female actor last year for “Killers of the
Flower Moon,” but the Oscar trophy went to Emma Stone for “Poor
Things”.)</p>
<p>Moore seemingly solidified her Oscar chances by following up her
Golden Globe win for her performance in “The Substance.” Moore, whose
campaign was boosted by her speech about being pigeonholed a “popcorn
actress,” has traded awards with “Anora” breakthrough Mikey Madison.</p>
<p>“What we believe is so much more powerful than what we think,” said
Moore. “The saying, ‘I’ll believe it when I see it’ — the reality is
when I believe it, I will see it.”</p>
<p>The SAG Awards unfolded against the backdrop of the aftermath of the
devastating wildfires that began in early January. Those fires forced
the guild to cancel its in-person nominations announcement and launch a
disaster relief fund for SAG-AFTRA members affected. Host Kristen Bell
introduced attending firefighters as “the most attractive tables” among
a sea of stars.</p>
<p>Jane Fonda, 87, given the guild’s Life Achievement Award, provided
the evening with its most passionately political moment. Fonda, a famed
activist, spoke indirectly about President Donald Trump’s
administration.</p>
<p>“We are in our documentary moment,” said Fonda. “This is it. And it’s
not a rehearsal.”</p>
<p>Fonda added that “woke just means you give a damn about other
people.”</p>
<p>“A whole lot of people are going to be hurt by what’s happening, by
what’s coming our way,” said Fonda. “We are going to need a big tent to
resist what’s coming at us.”</p>
<p>Jean Smart, who had advocated for canceling award shows because of
the wildfires, won best female actor in a comedy series for “Hacks.”
Smart didn’t attend, but participated in a pre-taped introduction as her
character, Deborah Vance.</p>
<p>Also not in attendance: Martin Short, though he upset Jeremy Allen
White to win best male actor in a comedy series for “Only Murders in the
Building.” The Hulu series also won for best comedy ensemble.</p>
<p>“Wait, we never win. This is so weird,” said Selena Gomez. “Marty and
Steve (Martin) aren’t here because, you know, they don’t really
care.”</p>
<p>Colin Farrell won his first SAG award, for his performance in “The
Penguin” and also became the first winner ever introduced, by Jamie Lee
Curtis, as “the man who gave me COVID at the Golden Globes.” Farrell
bounded to the stage and promptly responded, “Guilty as charged,” before
blaming Brendan Gleeson for giving it to him.</p>
<p>The night’s first televised award went to Culkin, who has won just
about every award in the category for “A Real Pain.” Gripping the SAG
trophy, he could quickly tell the difference.</p>
<p>“It is funny that the heaviest of all awards is given by actors,”
said Culkin, who characteristically riffed his way through a rambling
acceptance speech before swearing sincerity: “Believe it or not, this
actually means a lot to me.”</p>
<p>Netflix’s “Emilia Perez,” which has seen its awards hopes largely
dashed by controversy over old tweets by lead actor Karla Sofia Gascon,
took home the award for best female supporting actor, for Oscar favorite
Saldana.</p>
<p>For Netflix’s second time around streaming the awards, it inserted
ads sporadically, like a traditional broadcast. Last year, downtimes
were occupied by backstage interviews. Audio issues occasionally marred
the broadcast, including brief interruptions of Fonda’s speech.</p>
<p>After romps at the Emmys and Golden Globes, “Shogun” kept up its
dominance. The FX series won best drama series ensemble, along with
acting awards for Hiroyuki Sanada, Anna Sawai and for best stunt
ensemble. The corresponding award for film went to the stunt performer
ode “The Fall Guy.”</p>

Harris receives prestigious Chairman’s prize at NAACP Image Awards</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — Former Vice President Kamala Harris stepped on the
NAACP Image Awards stage Saturday night with a sobering message, calling
the civil rights organization a pillar of the Black community and urging
people to stay resilient and hold onto their faith during the tenure of
President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>“While we have no illusions about what we are up against in this
chapter in our American story, this chapter will be written not simply
by whoever occupies the oval office nor by the wealthiest among us,”
Harris said after receiving the NAACP’s Chairman’s Award. “The American
story will be written by you. Written by us. By we the people.”</p>
<p>The 56th annual Image Awards was held at the Pasadena Civic
Auditorium in the Los Angeles area.</p>
<p>Harris, defeated by Trump in last year’s presidential election, was
the first woman and the first person of color to serve as vice
president. She had previously been a U.S. senator from California and
the state’s attorney general.</p>
<p>In her first major public appearance since leaving office, Harris did
not reference her election loss or Trump’s actions since entering the
Oval Office, although Trump mocked her earlier in the day at the
Conservative Political Action Conference.</p>
<p>Harris spoke about eternal vigilance, the price of liberty, staying
alert, seeking the truth and America’s future.</p>
<p>“Some see the flames on our horizons, the rising waters in our
cities, the shadows gathering over our democracy and ask ‘What do we do
now?’” Harris said. “But we know exactly what to do, because we have
done it before. And we will do it again. We use our power. We organize,
mobilize. We educate. We advocate. Our power has never come from having
an easy path.”</p>
<p>Other winners of the Chairman’s prize have included former President
Barack Obama, the late Rep. John Lewis and the late actor Ruby Dee.</p>
<p>NAACP Hall of Fame</p>
<p>Harris was honored during the ceremony along with the Wayans family.
The family was inducted into the NAACP Image Awards Hall of Fame in
recognition of pioneering contributions to film, TV, sketch and stand-up
comedy that have shaped Hollywood for decades.</p>
<p>Keenen Ivory Wayans, Damon Wayans Sr., Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans,
Kim Wayans and Damon Wayans Jr. each were recognized.</p>
<p>Marlon Wayans, whose guest appearance on Peacock’s “Bel-Air” was up
for an NAACP award, shared how Keenen Ivory Wayans sparked the family’s
rise.</p>
<p>“He raised us all like Jedis,” he said. “We wouldn’t be here if it
wasn’t for our big brother.”</p>
<p>Marlon Wayans joked that when his brother told their mom he was
leaving college for comedy, she said, “Boy, I’ve known you your whole
life, and you ain’t never said nothing funny. That’s the funniest thing
you’ve said.”</p>
<p>The crowd erupted in laughter, a fitting tribute to a family that has
kept audiences laughing for more than three decades.</p>
<p>The family has a long list of credits. Keenen Ivory Wayans created
the sketch comedy series “In Living Color” in 1990 and directed the 2000
slasher spoof “Scary Movie,” which was written by Marlon Wayans and
Shawn Wayans, who also wrote and starred in “White Chicks” in 2004.
Damon Wayan’s had a starring role in the 1995 comedy “Major Payne,” and
currently co-stars with son Damon Wayans Jr. in the CBS sitcom “Poppa’s
House,” which was nominated for an NAACP Award. The pair also were
nominated for their acting on the show.</p>
<p>Damon Wayans Jr. has acted in two of the most critically acclaimed
comedies in recent years: “Happy Endings” and “New Girl.” Kim Wayans, a
comedian, actor and director, also received praise for her work in the
2011 drama “Pariah.”</p>
<p>Entertainer of the year</p>
<p>Keke Palmer expressed her surprise after her name was called as
winner of the coveted entertainment of the year.</p>
<p>“Oh my gosh. Guys, I didn’t think I was going to win,” said Palmer,
who paid homage to fellow nominee Cynthia Erivo’s Oscar-nominated
performance in “Wicked.”</p>
<p>Palmer starred in the buddy comedy “One of Them Days,” which debuted
No. 1 at the box office last month. She also won an Emmy for her hosting
efforts on NBC’s “Password.”</p>
<p>“It’s such an amazing category to be in with all these people,”
Palmer said. “It’s a beautiful night. It’s Black History Month, y’all.
It’s so important we all come here together and celebrate one another
with one another.”</p>
<p>Other nominees included Kendrick Lamar, Kevin Hart and Shannon
Sharpe.</p>
<p>Awards recognize LA residents impacted by wildfires</p>
<p>Image Awards host Deon Cole honored residents of the nearby Altadena
neighborhood who were affected by January’s devastating Los Angeles-area
wildfires.</p>
<p>A video of the fire devastation played before actor Morris Chestnut
took the stage.</p>
<p>“Homes were lost, stores destroyed, countless lives shattered and
over two dozen souls gone forever,” said Chestnut, a Los Angeles native
who referenced impacted areas such as Altadena, the Pacific Palisades
and Malibu.</p>
<p>“But what was not lost is the spirit of our community,” said
Chestnut, who noted 22 Altadena residents attended the show on Saturday.
Many in the audience stood and applauded.</p>
<p>Cole shifted tone and brightened the mood with a comedic prayer for
Kanye West’s wife to find more clothes after her barely-there Grammys
look and for Shannon Sharpe to finally size up his T-shirts.</p>
<p>The opening act was a lead-up to the evening’s first award: Queen
Latifah as best actress in a drama series for her role in “The
Equalizer.”</p>
<p>Chappelle honored</p>
<p>Dave Chappelle was honored with the President’s Award for his
“thought-provoking humor.”</p>
<p>Accepting the award, Chappelle talked about the NAACP’s push against
negative portrayals of Black people in media and the importance of
representation.</p>
<p>“Every opportunity we get, we just keep chipping away at this monster
of a machine,” he said.</p>
<p>Past recipients of the President’s Award include Jay-Z, Lauryn Hill,
Usher, Rihanna and John Legend.</p>

governor asks Congress for nearly $40 billion for Los Angeles wildfire
relief</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Sacramento, California — California Gov. Gavin Newsom has asked
Congress to approve nearly $40 billion in aid to help the Los Angeles
area recover from January’s devastating wildfires, which he said could
become the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history.</p>
<p>Newsom sent a letter Friday asking for support from lawmakers
including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Rep. Tom Cole, the House
Appropriations Committee chair.</p>
<p>“Los Angeles is one of the most economically productive places on the
globe, but it can only rebound and flourish with support from the
federal government as it recovers from this unprecedented disaster,”
Newsom wrote.</p>
<p>The total economic losses from the firestorm have been estimated to
surpass $250 billion — with real estate losses from the Palisades and
Eaton fires predicted to potentially top $30 billion, according to a Los
Angeles Times analysis. More than 16,200 structures were destroyed as
flames ripped through Pacific Palisades, Malibu, Pasadena and
Altadena.</p>
<p>Newsom vowed that the funding would be used to rebuild homes,
infrastructure, businesses, schools, churches and health care
facilities, while supporting the needs of people affected by the
devastation.</p>
<p>“Make no mistake, Los Angeles will use this money wisely,” Newsom
wrote.</p>
<p>His largest request is for an additional $16.8 billion from the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, mostly intended for the rebuilding
of property and infrastructure, with $5 billion earmarked for debris
cleanup.</p>
<p>Newsom also asked for $9.9 billion from the Department of Housing and
Urban Development for grants to fire victims, homeowners, businesses and
renters, as well as $5.29 billion from the Small Business Administration
for homeowner and business loans.</p>
<p>Newsom thanked President Donald Trump for support for fast-tracking
debris removal. The letter did not mention recent threats by the Trump
administration that federal aid could come with strings attached.</p>
<p>“We are eternally grateful,” Newsom said.</p>
<p>Trump has been a frequent critic of Newsom and California’s water
policies. Ric Grenell, a Trump ally serving as his envoy for special
missions, said Friday that “there will be conditions” to any federal aid
for the state.</p>
<p>He said one of the possible conditions being discussed was defunding
the California Coastal Commission, which regulates coastal development
and protects public beach access. Trump has criticized the agency as
overly restrictive, bureaucratic and a hindrance to timely rebuilding
efforts.</p>

administration fires 2,000 USAID workers, puts thousands of others on
leave</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The Trump administration said Sunday that it was placing
all but a fraction of staffers at the U.S. Agency for International
Development on leave worldwide and eliminating 2,000 U.S.-based staff
positions.</p>
<p>The move was the latest and one of the biggest steps yet toward what
President Donald Trump and cost-cutting ally Elon Musk say is their goal
of gutting the six-decade-old aid and development agency in a broader
campaign to slash the size of the federal government.</p>
<p>The move comes after a federal judge on Friday allowed the
administration to move forward with its plan to pull thousands of USAID
staffers off the job in the United States and around the world. U.S.
District Judge Carl Nichols rejected pleas in a lawsuit from employees
to keep temporarily blocking the government’s plan.</p>
<p>“As of 11:59 p.m. EST on Sunday, February 23, 2025, all USAID direct
hire personnel, with the exception of designated personnel responsible
for mission-critical functions, core leadership and/or specially
designated programs, will be placed on administrative leave globally,”
according to the notices sent to USAID workers that were viewed by The
Associated Press.</p>
<p>At the same time, the agency said it was beginning a reduction in
force that would eliminate 2,000 U.S.-based staffers. That means many of
the Washington-based staffers who are being placed on leave would soon
have their positions eliminated.</p>
<p>The Trump appointee running USAID, deputy administrator Pete Marocco,
has indicated he plans to keep about 600 mostly U.S.-based staffers on
the job in the meantime, in part to arrange travel for USAID staffers
and families abroad.</p>
<p>USAID and the State Department did not immediately respond to
messages seeking comment.</p>
<p>The move escalates a monthlong push to dismantle the agency, which
has included closing its headquarters in Washington and shutting down
thousands of aid and development programs worldwide following an effort
to freeze all foreign assistance. Trump and Musk contend that USAID’s
work is wasteful and furthers a liberal agenda.</p>
<p>Lawsuits by government workers’ unions, USAID contractors and others
say the administration lacks the constitutional authority to eliminate
an independent agency or congressionally funded programs without
lawmakers’ approval.</p>
<p>The Trump administration efforts upend decades of U.S. policy that
aid and development work overseas serves national security by
stabilizing regions and economies and building alliances, a critical
tool of U.S. “soft power” for winning influence abroad.</p>
<p>The notices of firings and leaves come on top of hundreds of USAID
contractors receiving no-name form letters of termination in the past
week, according to copies that AP viewed.</p>
<p>The blanket nature of the notification letters to USAID contractors,
excluding the names or positions of those receiving them, could make it
difficult for the dismissed workers to get unemployment benefits,
workers noted.</p>
<p>A different judge in a second lawsuit tied to USAID has temporarily
blocked the foreign funding freeze and said this past week that the
administration had kept withholding the aid despite his court order and
must at least temporarily restore the funding to programs worldwide.</p>

id="some-us-agencies-tell-workers-not-to-reply-to-musks-accomplishments-email">Some
US agencies tell workers not to reply to Musk’s ‘accomplishments
email’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Multiple U.S. federal agencies told employees not to
respond immediately to a demand by President Donald Trump’s adviser Elon
Musk to list their accomplishments in the last week or be fired, as a
chaotic campaign to cull the bureaucracy pushes forward.</p>
<p>Trump administration-appointed officials at the FBI and State
Department sent their staff emails telling them not to respond outside
their chains of command, in a possible sign of tension between members
of the Republican administration and the world’s richest person in his
campaign to cut down the government’s 2.3 million-member civilian
workforce.</p>
<p>“The FBI, through the office of the director, is in charge of all our
review processes,” said FBI Director Kash Patel, a Trump appointee, in
an email to staff seen by Reuters.</p>
<p>Musk leads the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE),
which in the first weeks of Trump’s administration has laid off more
than 20,000 workers and offered buyouts to another 75,000, across wide
swaths of the government from the Defense Department — long a top
Republican priority — to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, where
all staff have been ordered to halt work.</p>
<p>The frantic pace has led the federal government in some cases to rush
to rehire workers who perform critical functions like securing the
nation’s nuclear arsenal and trying to fight the worsening bird flu
outbreak, which has caused egg prices to spike higher.</p>
<p>While there is bipartisan agreement that the U.S. government, which
carries $36 trillion in debt, would benefit from reform, Musk’s
tumultuous approach has drawn widespread criticism, including from
voters in some Republican areas.</p>
<p>Federal workers Saturday evening received an email instructing them
to detail the work they did during the previous week by 11:59 p.m. ET on
Monday (0459 GMT Tuesday), shortly after Musk posted on his X social
media site that failing to respond would be taken as a resignation.</p>
<p>The subject of the email read, “What did you do last week?” and came
from a human resources address in the Office of Personnel Management,
but did not include Musk’s threat of termination.</p>
<p>Workers at the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Education
and Commerce, as well as at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,
the National Institutes of Health and the Internal Revenue Service also
were told not to respond, pending further guidance, according to sources
and emails reviewed by Reuters.</p>
<p>“To be clear — this is irregular, unexpected, and warrants further
validation,” a senior executive at the National Centers for
Environmental Information, an agency that manages environmental data and
is part of the Commerce Department, wrote.</p>
<p>Some officials welcomed the move. Ed Martin, Trump’s nominee for U.S.
Attorney in Washington, D.C., who is serving in an interim capacity,
praised Musk and DOGE in an email response.</p>
<p>But other offices within the Justice Department, including the
executive office that supports all U.S. attorneys and the department’s
civil division, told employees not to reply, pending additional
information.</p>
<p>Employees at the Drug Enforcement Administration, part of the Justice
Department, were told to respond, according to an email seen by
Reuters.</p>
<p>Union questions Musk’s authority</p>
<p>The largest federal workers’ union, the American Federation of
Government Employees, wrote on X on Sunday that it did not believe Musk
had the authority to fire employees who did not respond and would
formally request that OPM rescind the message.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the union advised members to ask their supervisors
directly whether to reply and to follow their guidance.</p>
<p>The email left some employees even more frustrated and worried after
weeks of uncertainty about their futures.</p>
<p>“I really wonder when someone is going to say enough,” one IRS
employee told Reuters.</p>
<p>Media offices at the Commerce, Justice, Education and Treasury
departments, as well as at the FDIC and NIH, did not immediately respond
to requests for comment. An FBI spokesperson declined to comment, and a
State Department spokesperson referred questions to the White House.</p>
<p>Musk on X on Sunday called the email “a very basic pulse check.”</p>
<p>Senator John Curtis, a Republican from Utah, said he supports the
Trump administration’s efforts to reduce government spending, but that
Musk should take a more humane approach.</p>
<p>“If I could say one thing to Elon Musk, it’s please put a dose of
compassion in this,” Curtis said on CBS News’ “Face the Nation.”</p>
<p>“These are real people. These are real lives. These are mortgages.
It’s a false narrative to say we have to cut, and you have to be cruel
to do it as well.”</p>
<p>Some federal judiciary employees, including judges, also received the
Saturday email from OPM, even though the court system is not part of the
executive branch, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts
confirmed.</p>
<p>The judiciary advised employees that no action should be taken in
response to the message, according to an email reviewed by Reuters.</p>
<p>In some cases, employees were left unsure how to respond even if they
chose to do so.</p>
<p>Some lawyers, for instance, expressed concern that their work is
confidential.</p>
<p>Workers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also received the
email, according to people with knowledge of the matter, even though
they were all ordered to cease working since early this month, leaving
them with little to do.</p>

id="hegseth-defends-trumps-firings-of-pentagon-leaders-says-more-may-be-to-come">Hegseth
defends Trump’s firings of Pentagon leaders, says more may be to
come</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth insists President Donald
Trump ’s abrupt firing of the nation’s senior military officer amid a
wave of dismissals at the Pentagon wasn’t unusual and he suggested more
firings could come.</p>
<p>“Nothing about this is unprecedented,” Hegseth told “Fox News Sunday”
about Air Force Gen. CQ Brown Jr. being removed Friday night as chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “The president deserves to pick his key
national security advisory team.”</p>
<p>Hegseth said “there are lots of presidents who made changes” citing
former commanders in chief, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, George H.W.
Bush and Barack Obama. Obama, Hegseth said, “fired or dismissed
hundreds” of military officials.</p>
<p>Months into his first term, Obama removed Army Gen. David McKiernan
from being commander of the U.S. forces in Afghanistan. However, Trump,
while running for his second term, vowed to eradicate “woke” ideologies
from the military and to swiftly dismiss many top leaders.</p>
<p>Hegseth and Trump have made no secret about focusing on pushing aside
military officers who have supported diversity, equity and inclusion in
the ranks. The administration says the move will better fortify a lethal
fighting force.</p>
<p>Brown was just the second Black general to serve as chairman. His 16
months in the post were consumed with the war in Ukraine and the
expanded conflict in the Middle East. Trump in 2020 nominated Brown as
Air Force’s chief of staff.</p>
<p>Trump wants to replace Brown with Air Force Lt. Gen. Dan “Razin”
Caine, who retired in December. It is unclear what recalling Caine to
active-duty service will require. The position requires Caine to be
confirmed by the Senate.</p>
<p>Hegseth said Friday’s dismissals affected six three- and four-star
generals and were “a reflection of the president wanting the right
people around him to execute the national security approach we want to
take.”</p>
<p>He called Brown “honorable” but said he is “not the right man for the
moment,” without citing specific deficiencies. After the 2020 murder of
George Floyd, Brown in a video spoke of his experience as a Black pilot,
apparently making him fodder for the Trump administration’s wars against
inclusion initiatives in the military.</p>
<p>Of Caine, Hegseth said that Trump “respects leaders who untie the
hands of war fighters in a very dangerous world.”</p>
<p>Retired Gen. George Casey called the firings “extremely
destabilizing.” Casey, who was Republican President George W. Bush’s
commander of the U.S. and multinational forces in Iraq from 2004 to
2007, also noted that the Trump administration can change Pentagon
policy without changing personnel, but added, that what happened is
“within the president’s prerogative.”</p>
<p>“That’s his prerogative,” Casey told ABC’s “This Week.” “He is the
commander in chief of the armed forces.”</p>
<p>Still, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat on the
Senate Armed Services Committee told ABC that the firings were
“completely unjustified” and that “apparently, what Trump and Hegseth
are trying to do is to politicize the Department of Defense.”</p>
<p>Hegseth was also asked on Fox News about officials potentially
compiling lists of more defense officials they plan to fire. He said
there was no list but suggested that more dismissals could indeed be
coming.</p>
<p>“We have a very keen eye towards military leadership and their
willingness to follow lawful order,” Hegseth said. “Joe Biden gave
lawful orders. A lot of them are really bad,” he said, adding that
things like COVID vaccine mandates “eroded” the military
ideologically</p>
<p>“President Trump has given another set of lawful orders and they will
be followed,” Hegseth said. “If they’re not followed then those officers
will find the door.”</p>

Airlines flight from New York to Delhi lands safely in Rome after
security concern</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Rome, Italy — An American Airlines flight from New York to New Delhi,
India, landed safely in Rome on Sunday afternoon after it was diverted
due to a security concern , which later proved to be “non-credible,” the
airline said. </p>
<p>American Airlines said Flight 292 “was inspected by law enforcement”
after landing at Leonardo da Vinci International Airport and “cleared to
re-depart.” </p>
<p>It didn’t clarify the cause of the security concern, but added an
inspection was required by protocol before the flight could land in New
Delhi. </p>
<p>“The flight will stay in Rome overnight to allow for required crew
rest before continuing to Delhi as soon as possible tomorrow,” the
airline said. </p>
<p>An Associated Press reporter filmed two fighter jets flying over the
airport shortly before the unscheduled landing. Fire trucks were visible
on the landing strip on one side of the plane after it landed. </p>
<p>The airport continued to operate normally, a spokesman with Rome’s
airport said.</p>

id="captain-america-dives-in-2nd-weekend-the-monkey-boosts-neons-successes">‘Captain
America’ dives in 2nd weekend, ‘The Monkey’ boosts Neon’s successes</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — “Captain America: Brave New World” soared on opening
weekend but crashed down in its second go-around with audiences. </p>
<p>“Brave New World,” the latest sign that the Marvel machine isn’t
quite what it used to be, remained No. 1 at the box office in its second
frame with $28.2 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates
Sunday. But after a debut of $100 million over four days and $88 million
over three days, that meant a steep drop of 68%. </p>
<p>While blockbusters often see significant slides in their second
weekends, only two previous MCU titles have fallen off so fast: 2023’s
“The Marvels,” which fell 78%, and 2023’s “Ant-Man and the Wasp:
Quantumania,” which dropped 70%. </p>
<p>The Anthony Mackie-led “Captain America” installment has been slammed
by critics, and audiences also have graded it poorly, with a “B-”
CinemaScore. “Brave New World,” which fans had hoped would right the
Marvel ship, has been largely met as another example of a once
impenetrable brand struggling to recapture its pre- “Avengers: Endgame”
aura of invincibility. </p>
<p>Still, “Brave New World” has quickly grossed $289.4 million
worldwide, with international sales nearly reaching $150 million. And
with few big-budget offerings arriving in theaters in the coming weeks,
it will have scant competition through much of March. </p>
<p>The biggest new release of the weekend was Oz Perkins’ “The Monkey,”
the director’s follow-up to his 2024 horror hit, “Longlegs.” Adapted
from a Stephen King short story, “The Monkey” opened with $14.2 million
for Neon, the second-best debut for the indie distributor. The best?
“Longlegs,” which launched with $22.4 million. </p>
<p>Neon had much to celebrate over the weekend. Its top awards
contender, “Anora,” by Sean Baker, continues to gather momentum into
next Sunday’s Academy Awards. The best-picture favorite added wins at
the Independent Spirit Awards on Saturday. </p>
<p>Perkins, Neon and Blumhouse, which partnered in the release of “The
Monkey,” have found a productive low-budget collaboration, with more on
the way. Even if “The Monkey” doesn’t reach the heights of “Longlegs”
($126.9 million globally), Perkins and Neon return with “Keeper” this
October. </p>
<p>“The Monkey,” starring Tatiana Maslany and Theo James, revolves
around an old monkey toy found in an attic. Reviews have been good (77%
fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), though audiences were less impressed, giving
it a C+ CinemaScore. Horror films, though, typically grade low. </p>
<p>As it did with “Longlegs,” Neon leaned into cryptic promotion for
“The Monkey,” along with some macabre marketing. A funeral premiere was
held at Los Angeles’ Immanuel Presbyterian Church, and fan screenings
took place at the Hollywood Cemetery. The film, produced by James Wan,
cost $10 million to make. </p>
<p>Lionsgate’s “The Unbreakable Boy” opened with a paltry $2.5 million
in 1,687 theaters. The Christian-themed Jon Gunn-directed film starring
Zachary Levi and Meghann Fahy, is about parents who learn their son is
autistic and has brittle bone disease. </p>
<p>“Paddington in Peru,” the third installment of the marmalade-mad
bear, fell to third place in its second weekend. It grossed $6.5 million
in 3,890 locations, bringing its two-week total to $25.2 million.
“Paddington in Peru” has been most popular overseas, where its collected
$150 million thus far. </p>
<p>“Ne Zha 2,” the animated Chinese juggernaut, took in $3.1 million
from 800 theaters in its second weekend. In China, the sequel has
grossed $1.7 billion this month, setting numerous box-office records.
Those totals put “Ne Zha 2” past “Inside Out 2” ($1.66 billion) as the
highest grossing animated film ever. </p>
<p>Top 10 movies by domestic box office </p>
<p>With final domestic figures releasing Monday, this list factors in
the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and
Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. </p>

<li><p>“Captain America: Brave New World,” $28.2 million. </p></li>

id="washington-kyiv-headed-toward-deal-for-ukrainian-critical-minerals-rights">Washington,
Kyiv headed toward deal for Ukrainian ‘critical minerals’ rights</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The United States and Ukraine said Sunday they are heading toward an
agreement for Kyiv to give Washington a large share of its rare earth
mineral rights as compensation for the billions of dollars in munitions
the U.S. sent to Ukraine to defend itself from Russia’s full-scale
war.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told a news conference in
Kyiv that Ukraine and the U.S. are “making progress” in reaching a deal.
He said a draft of the pact calls for Ukraine to pay the U.S. $2 for
each dollar in aid the U.S. has sent to Kyiv to fight Russia’s invasion,
although details of the would-be agreement have not been disclosed.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy called for security guarantees for Ukraine as part of any
deal and said he wants better financial terms. “I don’t want something
that 10 generations of Ukrainians will have to pay back,” he said.</p>
<p>The war hits the three-year mark on Monday.</p>
<p>Watch related report by Veronica Balderas Iglesias:</p>
<p>The U.S. has been Ukraine’s biggest benefactor, sending $128 billion
in military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, according to
Germany’s Kiel Institute for the World Economy. The U.S. share is just
ahead of the combined $124 billion figure for the 27-nation European
Union.</p>
<p>U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff told CNN’s “State of the Union” that
he expects Zelenskyy will sign the minerals deal this week.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy at first rejected the U.S. demand for half of Ukraine’s
rare earth mineral supplies, which are used in the production of
technology products. Witkoff signaled in the CNN interview that the deal
will now be completed although he did not spell out details of the
agreement.</p>
<p>Witkoff said that European countries made their contributions to
Ukraine’s war efforts after reaching agreement with Kyiv to eventually
be paid back, but the U.S. had no such understanding.</p>
<p>Witkoff said such U.S. support for Ukraine with no repayment terms
made “no sense” to President Donald Trump, a long-time New York real
estate deal maker before entering politics in 2015.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy said, “I had an agreement with [former U.S. President Joe]
Biden and American Congress, I am grateful to the Congress, to the both
parties. And it was support by providing grants. Grant is not a loan.
And we don’t have to return the loan here. Maybe someone does not like
it and thinks that it’s unjust. Maybe. I don’t know. But here is what
this deal was about. It was grant. Therefore, it’s not about the figure.
We simply don’t see it as a loan.”</p>
<p>Trump, who last week called Zelenskyy a “dictator” and accused him of
starting the war even though Russia invaded Ukraine, has demanded the
repayments and blamed his predecessor, Biden, for not securing some form
of compensation guarantee.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy said Sunday he wants Trump to “understand” his position and
come through with concrete security guarantees to help Kyiv defend
itself against the Russian invasion.</p>
<p>“I want very much from Trump understanding of each other,” Zelenskyy
said at his news conference, adding: “Security guarantees from Trump are
much needed.”</p>
<p>Zelenskyy said he was willing to give up his presidency if it meant
peace in Ukraine, quipping that he could exchange his departure for
Ukraine’s entry into NATO, which Russia is adamantly opposed to.</p>
<p>“If [it means] peace for Ukraine, if you really need me to leave my
post, I am ready,” Zelenskyy said. “I can exchange this for NATO
[membership], if that condition is there, immediately.”</p>
<p>The top U.S. and Russian diplomats, U.S. Secretary of State Marco
Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, met in Saudi Arabia
without either Ukrainian or European officials last week to lay the
groundwork for peace talks to end the war. Zelenskyy complained about
Ukraine being excluded from the talks, but Trump said he could have
negotiated with Russia beforehand to talk Moscow out of invading.</p>
<p>“I’ve had very good talks with Putin, and I’ve had not such good
talks with Ukraine,” Trump told U.S. state governors at the White
House.</p>
<p>“They don’t have any cards, but they play it tough,” Trump said of
Ukraine.</p>
<p>Russian state television said in recent days that Trump’s view of the
Russia-Ukraine conflict is “in total alignment with the way we see
things.”</p>
<p>Witkoff said the war “wouldn’t have had to happen” if Ukraine hadn’t
been pushing at the time for membership in NATO. Kyiv is still pressing
to join the 32-nation pact, but Washington says it is unrealistic for
that to happen as part of a negotiated peace settlement to end the
war.</p>
<p>Witkoff said that eventually “you’ll see concessions signed by both
sides” in a peace deal.</p>
<p>Russia now controls about one-fifth of the internationally recognized
Ukrainian territory, with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov saying
Sunday Moscow has no intention of yielding any of the land back to the
Kyiv government.</p>
<p>“The people decided to join Russia a long time ago,” he said,
referring to Moscow-staged votes in eastern Ukraine held amid the
three-year offensive that were assailed as bogus by Kyiv, the West and
international monitors.</p>
<p>“No one will ever sell off these territories,” Peskov said. “That’s
the most important thing.”</p>
<p>A Trump call with Putin two weeks ago set the stage for the
Rubio-Lavrov talks in Saudi Arabia.  </p>
<p>“This is a dialogue between two extraordinary presidents,” Peskov
told state TV.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Zelenskyy said Russia launched 267 overnight drone attacks
on Ukraine, which he condemned as “aerial terror.” Ukrainian officials
reported damage in five regions of the country.  </p>
<p>Zelenskyy said that in the past week, Russia has targeted Ukraine
with nearly 1,150 attack drones, more than 1,400 guided aerial bombs and
35 missiles of various types. </p>

<h2 id="kremlin-hails-putin-trump-dialogue-as-promising">Kremlin hails
Putin-Trump dialogue as promising</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Moscow — The Kremlin on Sunday hailed dialogue between U.S. President
Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin — two “extraordinary”
presidents — as “promising,” and vowed it would “never” give up
territory seized in eastern Ukraine.</p>
<p>Trump broke with Western policy earlier this month by phoning Putin
to discuss how to end the conflict in Ukraine — a call hailed by Moscow
as ending three years of isolation for the Kremlin leader since he
launched his full-scale offensive in February 2022.</p>
<p>Top Russian and U.S. officials then met in Saudi Arabia last week to
discuss a “restoration” of ties and start a discussion on a possible
ceasefire — all without the involvement of Kyiv or Europe.</p>
<p>“This is a dialogue between two extraordinary presidents,” Kremlin
spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state TV on Sunday.</p>
<p>“That’s promising,” he added.</p>
<p>“It is important that nothing prevents us from realizing the
political will of the two heads of state.”</p>
<p>Trump’s overtures to Moscow have triggered alarm in Kyiv and across
Europe.</p>
<p>But it is unclear whether his moves will be able to bring Moscow and
Kyiv closer to a truce.</p>
<p>Peskov on Sunday ruled out any territorial concessions as part of a
settlement.</p>
<p>“The people decided to join Russia a long time ago,” he said,
referring to Moscow-staged votes in eastern Ukraine held amid the
offensive that were slammed as bogus by Kyiv, the West and international
monitors.</p>
<p>“No one will ever sell off these territories. That’s the most
important thing.”</p>
<p>‘God willed it’</p>
<p>Putin said God and fate had entrusted him and his army with “the
mission” to defend Russia.</p>
<p>“Fate willed it so, God willed it so, if I may say so. A mission as
difficult as it is honorable — defending Russia — has been placed on our
and your shoulders together,” he told servicemen who have fought in
Ukraine.</p>
<p>Russia was on Sunday marking Defender of the Fatherland Day — a
holiday hailing soldiers and veterans — a day before the three-year
anniversary of the start of its full-scale offensive.</p>
<p>“Today, at the risk of their lives and with courage, they are
resolutely defending their homeland, national interests and Russia’s
future,” Putin said in a video released by the Kremlin.</p>
<p>Moscow’s army had overnight launched a record 267 attack drones at
Ukraine, Kyiv’s air force said.</p>
<p>Among them, 138 were intercepted by air defense and 119 were
“lost.”</p>
<p>Ukraine did not say what happened to the remaining 10 but a separate
armed forces statement on Telegram said several regions, Kyiv included,
had been “hit.”</p>
<p>AFP journalists in the Ukrainian capital heard air defense systems in
operation throughout the night.</p>
<p>‘Inappropriate remarks’</p>
<p>Amid his outreach to Moscow, Trump has also verbally attacked
Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy falsely claiming Kyiv started the
war and that Zelenskyy was hugely unpopular at home.</p>
<p>The bitter war of words has threatened to undermine Western support
for Kyiv at a critical juncture in the conflict.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy on Sunday called for the Western coalition that has been
helping Kyiv fend off the Russian offensive for the last three years to
hold strong.</p>
<p>“We must do our best to achieve a lasting and just peace for Ukraine.
This is possible with the unity of all partners: we need the strength of
the whole of Europe, the strength of America, the strength of all those
who want lasting peace,” Zelenskyy said on Telegram.</p>
<p>Moscow has reveled in the spat between Trump and Zelenskyy.</p>
<p>“Zelenskyy makes inappropriate remarks addressed to the head of
state. He does it repeatedly,” Peskov said Sunday.</p>
<p>“No president would tolerate that kind of treatment. So his [Trump’s]
reaction is completely quite understandable.”</p>
<p>Scrambling to respond to Trump’s dramatic policy reversal, French
President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will
travel to Washington next week to make the case for supporting
Ukraine.</p>

id="new-fbi-director-patel-will-also-be-named-acting-head-of-firearms-agency-official-says">New
FBI Director Patel will also be named acting head of firearms agency,
official says</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — New FBI Director Kash Patel is expected to be named the
acting head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives,
a Justice Department official said Saturday.</p>
<p>Patel could be sworn in next week, the official said, putting Patel
in charge of two of the Justice Department’s largest agencies in an
unusual arrangement that raises questions about the future of the bureau
that has long drawn the ire of conservatives.</p>
<p>The Justice Department official spoke on the condition of anonymity
to discuss the move before it’s announced publicly. White House
officials didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday
evening.</p>
<p>Patel was sworn in Friday as FBI director after winning Senate
approval despite Democrats’ concerns about the steadfast Trump ally’s
plans to radically overhaul the FBI.</p>
<p>ATF is a separate agency with about 5,500 employees and is
responsible for enforcing the nation’s laws around firearms, explosives
and arson. Among other things, it’s in charge of licensing federal
firearms dealers, tracing guns used in crimes and analyzing intelligence
in shooting investigations.</p>
<p>The move was first reported Saturday by ABC News.</p>
<p>The news comes days after Attorney General Pam Bondi fired the ATF’s
top lawyer. Bondi said in a Fox News interview Friday that she fired
chief counsel Pamela Hicks because the agency was “targeting gun
owners.” Hicks, who spent more than 20 years as a Justice Department
lawyer, said in a social media post that being ATF chief counsel was the
“highest honor” of her career.</p>
<p>Conservatives have long railed against ATF over its role in
regulating firearms and have suggested shuttering the agency. Under the
Biden administration, the ATF advanced new regulations aimed at cracking
down on ghost guns and requiring thousands more firearms dealers to run
background checks on buyers at gun shows or other places outside
brick-and-mortar stores.</p>
<p>In an executive order earlier this month, President Donald Trump
directed the attorney general to review all actions taken by the Biden
administration around firearms “to assess any ongoing infringements of
the Second Amendment rights of our citizens.”</p>
<p>Gun safety groups have raised alarm about putting Patel in charge of
the FBI, with gun control group Brady calling him a “known gun rights
extremist.” Gun Owners of America, a gun rights group, called his
confirmation as FBI director “a major victory for gun owners and
constitutional rights advocates nationwide.”</p>
<p>The last confirmed ATF director was Steve Dettelbach, a former
federal prosecutor, who led the agency from July 2022 until last month.
He was the first confirmed director since 2015 as both Republican and
Democratic administrations failed to get nominees through the
politically fraught process.</p>

id="pakistan-threatens-to-deport-afghans-if-us-relocation-timeline-isnt-met">Pakistan
threatens to deport Afghans if US relocation timeline isn’t met</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD — Pakistan has warned that thousands of Afghan nationals
awaiting relocation and resettlement in the United States will be
deported to Afghanistan if their cases are rejected or not processed on
time.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar issued the warning during a television
interview aired Saturday, noting that the U.S. has promised to relocate
the Afghan community in question from Pakistan “tentatively around
September this year.” His office in Islamabad released the interview
excerpts.</p>
<p>“If any refugee who was undertaken to be taken by another country
after due process —no matter the timeline — if it doesn’t happen and the
country refuses, then for us, that will be an illegal immigrant in
Pakistan, and we might be forced to send such refugee back to [their]
original country, which is Afghanistan,” Dar told Turkey’s TRT national
broadcaster.</p>
<p>However, the chief Pakistani diplomat expressed Islamabad’s
willingness to resolve the issue with Washington, stating that his
government is “examining the situation and will negotiate
[accordingly].”</p>
<p>Last month, U.S. President Donald Trump halted refugee applications
and travel plans until further notice to ensure that refugee entry into
the United States aligns with its national interests.</p>
<p>The decision has stranded around 45,000 Afghans prepared to fly out
of Afghanistan and at least 15,000 qualified refugees currently in
Pakistan, according to #AfghanEvac, a coalition that assists Afghans
with their relocation and resettlement in the U.S.</p>
<p>These individuals were part of Afghan families who fled their country
following the Taliban insurgents’ retaking of power in 2021, primarily
seeking refuge from potential retribution because of their affiliations
with the U.S. and NATO forces during their nearly two-decade-long
presence in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>While about 80,000 of these Afghans have since been relocated from
Pakistan, officials in Islamabad assert that around 40,000 remain in a
state of limbo including around 15,000 in Pakistan destined for the
United States.</p>
<p>Since launching a crackdown on undocumented foreign migrants in
September 2023, Pakistan has forcibly repatriated more than 825,000
undocumented Afghan refugees to their home country, according to the
United Nations.</p>
<p>The government has recently intensified its crackdown, targeting both
documented and undocumented Afghan refugees.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ordered authorities last month to
remove all Afghans from Islamabad and the adjoining city of Rawalpindi
by Feb. 28 before arranging for deporting them to Afghanistan along with
others subsequently. The targeted population encompasses over 2.5
million Afghans nationwide, comprising lawful refugees, documented
economic migrants, and those without legal authorization to remain in
Pakistan.</p>
<p>Sharif’s directive stipulates March 31 as the deadline for the United
States and other countries to process the cases of Afghans awaiting
resettlements, thereby preventing their deportation.</p>

id="macron-starmer-to-meet-trump-offer-ideas-for-ukraine-security-guarantees">Macron,
Starmer to meet Trump, offer ideas for Ukraine security guarantees</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LONDON/PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime
Minister Keir Starmer will travel to Washington next week amid alarm in
Europe over U.S. President Donald Trump’s hardening stance toward
Ukraine and overtures to Moscow on the three-year conflict.</p>
<p>The leaders of Europe’s two nuclear powers, who will be traveling
separately, are expected to try to persuade Trump not to rush into a
ceasefire deal with Vladimir Putin at any cost, keep Europe involved and
discuss military guarantees to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Macron, who is trying to capitalize on a relationship with Trump
built during their first presidential terms, has said agreeing to a bad
deal that would amount to a capitulation of Ukraine would signal
weakness to the United States’ foes, including China and Iran.</p>
<p>“I will tell him: deep down you cannot be weak in the face of
President (Putin). It’s not you, it’s not what you’re made of and it’s
not in your interests,” he said in an hourlong question and answer
session on social media ahead of Monday’s visit to the White House.</p>
<p>The visits come amid a rift between Trump and Ukrainian President
Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom Trump described as a “dictator.” That has
alarmed Kyiv’s European allies, already reeling from a more aggressive
U.S. posture on trade, diplomacy and even domestic European
politics.</p>
<p>Philip Golub, a professor in international relations at the American
University in Paris, said Trump’s rapid-fire moves in his first weeks in
office, as well as the rhetoric from other U.S. officials, had been a
major shock for the Europeans.</p>
<p>“They could not have expected that somehow within the United States
would emerge this ultra-nationalist coalition of forces that would
actually challenge Europe’s voice in world affairs in such a stark and
strong way,” he told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said Macron believed he had a “historic role to play” in going to
Washington to ensure Europe can weigh in on the ultimate negotiations on
Ukraine. “Whether he can actually achieve something, however, in this
visit is an entirely different matter,” he added.</p>
<p>Starmer, who has also warned the end of the war cannot be a
“temporary pause before Putin attacks again,” will be in Washington on
Thursday.</p>
<p>Speaking on a Fox News podcast on Friday, Trump said Macron and
Starmer had not “done anything” to end the war. “No meetings with
Russia!” he said, although he described Macron as “a friend of mine” and
Starmer as “a very nice guy.”</p>
<p>However, the two countries are keen to show Trump they are ready to
take on a bigger burden for European security.</p>
<p>Britain and France are firming up ideas with allies for military
guarantees for Ukraine and their two leaders will seek to persuade Trump
to provide U.S. assurances in any post ceasefire deal, Western officials
said.</p>
<p>Their respective militaries began initial planning last summer for
the post-war scenario, but the discussions accelerated in November after
Trump secured the U.S. presidency, a French military official and two
diplomats said.</p>
<p>They have also been supported in putting together an array of options
by countries like Denmark and the Baltic states as Europeans discuss
what they would be ready to do should there be an accord and
peacekeepers required, officials said.</p>
<p>While both Britain and France have ruled out sending troops to
Ukraine immediately, the plans, still in concept stage, center around
providing air, maritime, land and cyber support that would aim to deter
Russia from launching any future attacks, Western officials said.</p>
<p>Air and sea assets could be based in Poland or Romania, restoring
safe international air space and ensuring the Black Sea remained safe
for international shipping, the official said.</p>
<p>Part of the British and French talks center around the possibility of
sending European peacekeepers. While U.S. boots on the ground may not be
necessary, deterrence in the form of U.S. medium-range missiles and
ultimately nuclear weapons will remain crucial.</p>
<p>The options being discussed would center not on providing troops for
the frontline or the 2,000-kilometer border which would remain secured
by Ukrainian forces, but further to the West, three European diplomats
and the military official said.</p>
<p>Those troops could be tasked with protecting key Ukrainian
infrastructure such as ports or nuclear facilities to reassure the
Ukrainian population. However, Russia has made it clear it would oppose
a European presence in Ukraine.</p>
<p>A French military official said there was little sense in talking
numbers at this stage because it would depend on what was finally
agreed, what international mandate was given and whether non-European
troops would also be involved.</p>
<p>“It’s not about the numbers of troops in Ukraine. It’s the ability to
mobilize and the ability to arrange everything into a package of
interoperability units,” the French official said.</p>
<p>A Western official said that even 30,000 troops could be on the “high
side.”</p>

id="musk-orders-us-federal-workers-to-describe-what-they-did-at-work-last-week-or-get-fired">Musk
orders US federal workers to describe what they did at work last week or
get fired</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Elon Musk, the billionaire head of the Trump
administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), threatened
Saturday to fire any federal worker who fails to explain what work they
have accomplished during the previous week. </p>
<p>The threat, issued in a post on the social media site X, was made
just hours after President Donald Trump posted on his own social media
network Truth Social that DOGE should get more aggressive in its
attempts to downsize and reshape the federal workforce. </p>
<p>“All federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to
understand what they got done last week,” Musk posted on X. “Failure to
respond will be taken as a resignation.” </p>
<p>As of Saturday evening, emails were sent to employees at federal
agencies including the Securities and Exchange Commission, National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention and others with the subject line, “What did you do last
week?” </p>
<p>The email, seen by Reuters, asks employees to reply to the email they
have received with five bullet points summarizing “what you accomplished
at work last week” and copy their managers. </p>
<p>The email sent from a human resources address gives employees until
11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Monday to respond. </p>
<p>It is unclear what legal basis Musk has to terminate federal workers
if they fail to respond to his request. </p>
<p>Workers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also received the
email Saturday, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
However, most agency staff had been ordered not to perform any tasks
since early this month, creating a conundrum. The agency is also under a
temporary court order not to resume mass firings pending the outcome of
legal proceedings. </p>
<p>A spokesperson for DOGE did not immediately respond to a request for
comment. </p>
<p>The AFGE, the union representing federal employees, said in a
statement it will challenge any “unlawful terminations.”  </p>
<p>“Once again, Elon Musk and the Trump administration have shown their
utter disdain for federal employees and the critical services they
provide to the American people,” said AFGE National President Everett
Kelley.  </p>
<p>The Trump administration’s fast-paced and controversial process to
reduce government spending by shrinking the federal workforce led by
Musk and his young aides at the cost-cutting DOGE has led to haphazard
firings that resulted in numerous mistakes and forced several agencies
to quickly rehire vital employees, such as those working on nuclear
safety, defense and power generation. </p>
<p>The first wave of job cuts has targeted workers who are easier to
fire, such as employees on the job for less than two years or those who
have started new roles within an agency. </p>
<p>The indiscriminate firings have led to DOGE terminating people whose
jobs are not funded by taxpayers and have begun to anger people across
the country who are concerned about a loss of services as well as the
impact of federal job losses on local economies. </p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly talked about Musk as the functional leader of
DOGE, which is not a Cabinet-level department, but the White House said
in a court filing earlier this month that Musk had no authority over
DOGE and was not an employee of the program.</p>

id="officer-killed-after-gunman-takes-hostages-at-pennsylvania-hospital">Officer
killed after gunman takes hostages at Pennsylvania hospital</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>YORK, PENNSYLVANIA — A man armed with a pistol and carrying zip ties
entered a Pennsylvania hospital’s intensive care unit Saturday and took
staff members hostage before he was killed by police in a shootout that
also left an officer dead, authorities said.</p>
<p>Three workers at UPMC Memorial Hospital, including a doctor, a nurse
and a custodian, and two other officers were shot and wounded in the
attack, York County District Attorney Tim Barker said. A fourth staffer
was injured in a fall.</p>
<p>Gunfire erupted after officers went to engage the shooter, whom
Barker identified as Diogenes Archangel-Ortiz, 49. He said
Archangel-Ortiz was holding at gunpoint a female staff member who had
her hands bound with zip ties when police opened fire.</p>
<p>“This is a huge loss to our community,” Barker said at a news
conference following the shooting. “It is absolutely clear, and beyond
any and all doubt, that the officers were justified in taking their
action using deadly force.”</p>
<p>Barker added that while the investigation is in its early stages, it
appears Archangel-Ortiz had previous contact with the hospital’s ICU
earlier in the week for “a medical purpose involving another individual”
and he intentionally targeted the workers there.</p>
<p>No one answered the door Saturday at an address in York believed to
be that of Archangel-Ortiz.</p>
<p>The officer who died was identified as Andrew Duarte of the West York
Borough Police Department.</p>
<p>“We all have broken hearts and are grieving at his loss,” West York
Borough Manager Shawn Mauck told The Associated Press.</p>
<p>Duarte was a law enforcement veteran who joined the department in
2022 after five years with the Denver Police Department, according to
his LinkedIn profile. He described receiving a “hero award” in 2021 from
Mothers Against Drunk Driving for his work in impaired driving
enforcement for the state of Colorado.</p>
<p>“I have a type A personality and like to succeed in all that I do,”
his LinkedIn profile said.</p>
<p>Duarte also worked as a patrol officer in Denver, was highly regarded
for his work and was close friends with other officers, the department
there said in a statement.</p>
<p>At a makeshift memorial on the front steps of the West York Borough
Police Department, Linda Shields dropped off roses Saturday and dabbed
tears as she thought of her son, a police officer in Maryland.</p>
<p>“He was so young,” Shields said of Duarte. “It makes no sense at
all.”</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro called the attack on police and health
care workers “the act of a coward.”</p>
<p>“Let it not be lost on anyone the act of extraordinary bravery and
courage by the health care workers here, by the law enforcement
professionals … who ran toward danger to keep people safe,” Shapiro
said.</p>
<p>UPMC Memorial is a five-story, 104-bed hospital that opened in 2019
in York, a city of about 40,000 people known for its creation of York
Peppermint Patties in 1940.</p>
<p>The shooting is part of a wave of gun violence in recent years that
has swept through U.S. hospitals and medical centers, which have
struggled to adapt to the growing threats. Such attacks have helped make
health care one of the nation’s most violent fields, with workers
suffering more nonfatal injuries from workplace violence than workers in
any other profession, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention.</p>
<p>In 2023, a shooter killed a security guard in the lobby of New
Hampshire’s state psychiatric hospital before being fatally shot by a
state trooper. In 2022, a man killed two workers at a Dallas hospital
while there to watch his child’s birth. In May of that year, a man
opened fire in a medical center waiting room in Atlanta, killing one
woman and wounding four. And just one month later, a gunman killed his
surgeon and three other people at a Tulsa, Oklahoma, medical office
because he blamed the doctor for his continuing pain after an
operation.</p>

revels in mass federal firings, jeers at Biden before CPAC crowd</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>OXON HILL, MARYLAND — President Donald Trump said Saturday that
“nobody has ever seen anything” like his administration’s sweeping
effort to fire thousands of federal employees and shrink the size of
government. </p>
<p>Addressing an adoring crowd at the Conservative Political Action
Conference in suburban Washington, Trump said, “We’re going to forge a
new and lasting political majority that will drive American politics for
generations to come.” </p>
<p>The president has spent the opening weeks of his administration
arguing that voters in November gave him a mandate to overhaul
government while cracking down on the U.S.-Mexico border and to extend
tax cuts that were the signature policy of his first
administration. </p>
<p>In a speech that lasted more than an hour, Trump predicted that the
Republican Party would defy history, which has shown that a president’s
party typically struggles during midterm congressional elections. Of
Republicans, he said, “I don’t think we’ve been at this level, maybe
ever.” </p>
<p>“Nobody’s ever seen anything like this, and nobody’s ever seen four
weeks like we had,” Trump said, likening his new administration’s
opening month to being on a roll through the first four holes of a round
of golf, which he said gave him confidence for the fifth. </p>
<p>Trump has empowered billionaire Elon Musk to help carry out the
firings; Musk vowed Saturday that more might be coming. </p>
<p>“Consistent with President <span class="citation"
data-cites="realDonaldTrump">@realDonaldTrump</span>’s instructions, all
federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand
what they got done last week,” Musk posted on X, which he owns. “Failure
to respond will be taken as a resignation.” </p>
<p>Trump also repeatedly said Saturday that he’d carry out harder-line
immigration policies. But those efforts have largely been overshadowed
by his administration’s mass federal firings. He announced that one
agency that had been significantly reduced, the U.S. Agency for
International Development, would have its Washington office taken over
by Customs and Border Protection officials. </p>
<p>“The agency’s name has been removed from its former building,” he
said. </p>
<p>The president also repeated his previous promises that his
administration will scrutinize the country’s gold depository at Fort
Knox. </p>
<p>“Would anybody like to join us?” he said to cheers from the crowd.
“We want to see if the gold is still there.” </p>
<p>‘Donald, don’t get angry’ </p>
<p>But Trump also devoted large parts of his address to last year’s
presidential race, jeering at former President Joe Biden and
mispronouncing the first name of former Vice President Kamala Harris —
his Election Day opponent. </p>
<p>He also mentioned Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat who ran for
president in 2020. </p>
<p>The president said immigration and border policy under Biden made him
angry. </p>
<p>“I couldn’t stand it,” Trump said, before cautioning himself,
“Donald, don’t get angry.” He went on to use an expletive to describe
what he thinks of Biden’s handling of border security, despite noting
that evangelical conservatives have urged him not to use foul
language. </p>
<p>Trump had kinder words for Chinese President Xi Jinping, saying “I
happen to like” him, while adding, “we’ve been treated very unfairly by
China and many other countries.” </p>
<p>President meets with world leaders</p>
<p>On the sidelines of the conference, Trump met with conservative
Polish President Andrzej Duda amid rising tensions in Europe over
Russia’s war in Ukraine. After he took the stage, Trump saluted Duda and
Argentine President Javier Milei, who separately addressed the
conference. </p>
<p>Trump called Duda “a fantastic man and a great friend of mine.” He
noted that Milei was “a MAGA guy, too, Make Argentina Great Again.” </p>
<p>Duda is a populist who has enjoyed a close relationship with Trump in
years past. Poland is a longtime ally of Ukraine. Trump upended recent
U.S. policy by dispatching top foreign policy advisers to Saudi Arabia
for direct talks with Russian officials that were aimed at ending
fighting in Ukraine. </p>
<p>Those meetings did not include Ukrainian or European officials, which
has alarmed U.S. allies. After his face-to-face with Duda, Trump is
meeting Monday at the White House with French President Emmanuel Macron
and Thursday with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. </p>
<p>Trump also has begun a public back and forth with Ukrainian President
Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom the U.S. president called a “dictator” while
falsely suggesting that Ukraine started the war — though on Friday he
acknowledged that Russia attacked its neighbor. </p>
<p>Trump said during his speech, “I’m dealing with President Zelenskyy.
I’m dealing with President Putin” and added of fighting in Ukraine, “It
affects Europe. It doesn’t really affect us.” </p>
<p>About ending the war in Ukraine, Trump said Saturday, “I think we’re
pretty close to a deal, and we better be close to a deal.”  </p>
<p>Later, the president and first lady Melania Trump were hosting an
evening reception and dinner at the White House for the National
Governors Association, which was holding their own weekend meetings in
Washington.</p>
