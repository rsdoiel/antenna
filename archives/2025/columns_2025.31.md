## 2025-08-07 OddŒº hashtags

date: 2025-08-10, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-08-07-oddŒº-hashtags">2025-08-07 OddŒº hashtags</h1>

<p>I was recently looking at my homepage and wondered about all the hashtags I used and how not all of them had a topic page. The <a href="Odd%CE%BC">OddŒº</a> page, for example, collects all the blogposts tagged <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23OddŒº">#OddŒº</a> (including this one). So I looked at the <a href="oddmu/oddmu-hashtags.1">hashtags</a> command and figured, &ldquo;this is going to be easy.&rdquo; ü§£</p>

<p>The first problem is that there are a lot of garbage hashtags. There are over 1000 hashtags used on this site! The garbage hashtags are the result of Markdown parsing mistakes that I never fixed. Apparently the list of hashtags includes the following:</p>

<pre><code>#1)
#fennel‚Äù
#fudge](fudge)_and_the_[pdq](../wiki?action=edit;id=pdq_&quot;click_to_edit_this_page&quot;)_rules_used_in_[zorcererofzo.
ffffff;fill-opacity:1&quot;)
###ÔΩ£
</code></pre>

<p>This is not great. üòî</p>

<p>I should fix those, and many more. ü§®</p>

<p>Furthermore, the hashtags are all downcased. So given a hashtag such as <code>#advanced_squad_leader</code> the code would have to infer the page name &ldquo;Advanced Squad Leader&rdquo;. But what about the hashtag <code>#√§lter werden</code>? If at all, that should link to a page called &ldquo;√Ñlter werden&rdquo;.</p>

<p>And so I concluded that this wasn&rsquo;t easy after all. I saved the changes I made on a branch, and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be merging that into the main branch.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Wikis">#Wikis</a></p>

<p><strong>2025-08-09</strong>. Well! I think I worked on it and I worked on it, and then I ran it, and kept on fixing the topic pages it created. But I think it worked!</p>

<p><strong>2025-08-10</strong>. Yesterday I cleaned up my site (somewhat) and today I released v1.18 of OddŒº. Yay me!</p>

## What‚Äôs up with sci-fi publishing?

date: 2025-08-09, from: Tracy Durnell Blog

Earlier this week, a friend and I were discussing the sci-fi genre (in books). Despite both of us reading little sci-fi in the past five years, we recognized all the authors on the Hugo finalists list. Only three of the finalist novels were sci-fi, two from the same author. (Apparently fantasy has been winning genre [&#8230;]

There's a difference between reading a site in a web browser and it being part of the web. As it turns out what became Web 2.0, all built as silos, could more accurately be called Anti-web 2.0. Underneath all the silos, the heart of the web is still beating. Ready for us to build on it again.

## 2025-08-03 GoToSocial and the Butlerian Jihad

date: 2025-08-09, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-08-03-gotosocial-and-the-butlerian-jihad">2025-08-03 GoToSocial and the Butlerian Jihad</h1>

<p>I run a single user instance for the fediverse using GoToSocial and since I&rsquo;m blocking <a href="2025-07-23-test">thousands of IP address ranges</a> &ndash; mostly from companies renting out bandwidth and computing power to web scrapers &ndash; I&rsquo;m also blocking my instance from seeing a lot of the fediverse. That&rsquo;s not good.</p>

<p>The solution is to continue blocking the big cloud providers like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Hentzner, OVH, Alibaba and whatever else they are called. But if I&rsquo;m following somebody from a fedi instance hosted by these big cloud providers, I should put the IP numbers associated with just those domain names onto a separate allow list.</p>

<p>Instead of using the Mastodon client protocol to get the list of people I&rsquo;m following, I can just access the database directly.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the script that adds IP addresses:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish
# Redirect the output of this script into /etc/butlerian-jihad/gotosocial.sh
echo &quot;#&quot; (date --iso)
set domains (sqlite3 /home/gotosocial/sqlite.db '
select distinct b.domain from follows as f
join accounts as a on f.account_id = a.id
join accounts as b on f.target_account_id = b.id
where a.username = &quot;alex&quot;
and b.domain is not null
union
select distinct b.domain from follow_requests as f
join accounts as a on f.account_id = a.id
join accounts as b on f.target_account_id = b.id
where a.username = &quot;alex&quot;
and b.domain is not null
order by 1')
set i 1
set m (count $domains)
for domain in $domains
    set ipv6 (host -t AAAA $domain | awk '/has IPv6 address/ { print $5}')
    set ipv4 (host -t A $domain | awk '/has address/ { print $4}')
    echo &quot;$i/$m $domain:&quot; $ipv4 $ipv6 &gt;&amp;2
    set i (math 1 + $i)
    for ip in $ipv4
        echo &quot;ipset add gotosocial $ip # $domain&quot;
    end
    for ip in $ipv6
        echo &quot;ipset add gotosocial6 $ip # $domain&quot;
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This prints lines such as the following to STDERR:</p>

<pre><code>157/244 republik.ch: 172.67.74.47 104.26.5.143 104.26.4.143 2606:4700:20::681a:48f 2606:4700:20::ac43:4a2f 2606:4700:20::681a:58f
</code></pre>

<p>And it prints lines such as the following to STDOUT:</p>

<pre><code>ipset add gotosocial 172.67.74.47 # republik.ch
ipset add gotosocial 104.26.5.143 # republik.ch
ipset add gotosocial 104.26.4.143 # republik.ch
ipset add gotosocial6 2606:4700:20::681a:48f # republik.ch
ipset add gotosocial6 2606:4700:20::ac43:4a2f # republik.ch
ipset add gotosocial6 2606:4700:20::681a:58f # republik.ch
</code></pre>

<p>I redirect STDOUT to a file called <code>gotosocial.sh</code> and then I run this script, which creates to IP sets called <code>gotosocial</code> and <code>gotosocial6</code>:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish
# https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/iptables-essentials-common-firewall-rules-and-commands

ipset create gotosocial hash:ip
ipset create gotosocial6 hash:ip family inet6

# this set is inserted at the beginning
iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set gotosocial src -j ACCEPT
ip6tables -I INPUT -m set --match-set gotosocial6 src -j ACCEPT

# recreate using: gotosocial-follower-ips &gt; gotosocial.sh
source gotosocial.sh

netfilter-persistent save

# Find the number of the rule (hopefully it is number one)
#   iptables --list INPUT
#   ip6tables --list INPUT
# To delete, verify the number of the rule:
#   iptables --list INPUT 1
#   ip6tables --list INPUT 1
# Now delete it the rule:
#   iptables --delete INPUT 1
#   ip6tables --delete INPUT 1
# Now you can destroy the two ipsets, too
#   ipset destroy gotosocial
#   ipset destroy gotosocial6
# And now you can rerun this script!
</code></pre>

<p>If you run it, you&rsquo;ll get warnings about duplicate entries, I&rsquo;m sure:</p>

<pre><code>ipset v7.17: Element cannot be added to the set: it's already added
</code></pre>

<p>In my case, for example, I have both of these entries and I didn&rsquo;t bother to fix this:</p>

<pre><code>ipset add gotosocial 151.101.129.91 # mastodon.online
ipset add gotosocial 151.101.129.91 # mastodon.social
</code></pre>

<p>There are plenty more, of course.</p>

<p>In any case, you should now have an allow list that prevents these IP addresses from getting blocked by <code>fail2ban</code> because the <code>gotosocial</code> rule comes first:</p>

<pre><code># iptables --list INPUT
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         
ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere             match-set gotosocial src
ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere             match-set allowlist src
f2b-alex-apache  tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             multiport dports http,https
f2b-butlerian-jihad  tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             multiport dports 0:65535
f2b-butlerian-jihad-week  tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             multiport dports 0:65535
f2b-alex-bots  tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             multiport dports http,https
f2b-recidive  tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere            
DROP       all  --  anywhere             anywhere             match-set banlist src
</code></pre>

<p>To delete and recreate the lists, I use the following:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish
ipset flush gotosocial
ipset flush gotosocial6
source gotosocial.sh
netfilter-persistent save
</code></pre>

You get to it through the Reading Lists <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/09/feedCorpsScreenShot.png?nodialog">sub-menu</a> of the Tools menu. There are three lists in the new version. A lot were false starts, they didn't make the cut. I'm always adding feeds to my blogroll and news.scripting.com. Unfortunately I can't say the same for podcasts, which are not hooked up to my podcast app. I really want a hot connection there. We'll get there. The reading lists feature is going to play a big role going forward in the open social web we're building. BTW, I really like the name <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=feedcorps">FeedCorps</a>. I haven't talked about it very much. It's a cause, like peace or freedom. Open those suckas up.

Here's a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/325">writeup</a> with a place to comment and perhaps to collaborate on doing this for real. ChatGPT has real limits. This has to be done off on the side. It certainly could be done with their API. I'm head-down on other projects and can't do it myself but as I explain in the writeup, it would plug in beautifully to stuff I'm doing and it would all be open, so a new kind of feed reader is possible. And we could find news from other bloggers that the journalists aren't reporting on, the same way we relied on blogs in the early days to learn about what was going on on the web. It's time to do that again.

## ‚òÖ Gold, Frankincense, and Silicon

date: 2025-08-09, updated: 2025-08-09, from: Daring Fireball

It is disturbing to think that the leader of a beloved, trusted, and widely believed-to-be-ethical company like Apple has succumbed to avarice. That Tim Cook feels no qualms about‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâor perhaps even delights in‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâparticipating in a quid-pro-quo-driven corrupt administration in which flattery, fealty, gifts, and barely-concealed bribes are rewarded. That the United States devolving into kleptocracy suits Tim Cook just fine, because Apple‚Äôs pockets are deep enough to pay the vig.

But the alternative is more disturbing.

## I want the web to be like Harvard

date: 2025-08-08, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Back in the beginning I wanted the web to be like Harvard.</p>
<p>It's one of the reasons I went there as a research fellow in 2003. </p>
<p>I wasn't satisfied with the web, the density of minds wasn't up to my expectations, so I thought if I brought the web to the minds, that might work better. I wanted to work on communication systems for people trying to work together to solve big problems. </p>
<p>I chose Harvard over MIT, because the web was already strong at MIT, and they weren't friendly to my cause, they were busy trying to reinvent the web when it imho didn't need that. I hoped instead, Harvard, more a school of the liberal arts, would be more open to innovation in communication between people as opposed to between machines. I felt, in 2003, that was a solved problem on the web.</p>
<p>It didn't happen there either, some <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/01/21/141332.html?title=twentyYearsAgoInPodcasting">great</a> <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/09/30/aPodcastAboutPodcasting.html">stuff</a> did come out of that period, and some of it was lasting, but eventually the university wasn't on board with the web as a community for intellect. Instead what came out of Harvard in that period was Facebook, which is a great accomplishment. I am a FB user to this day and appreciate how well it works at keeping friends from long ago in contact. </p>
<p>I still want an intellectual community on the web. That's why I'm putting so much effort into rebuilding it as a writing environment. All this because the writing products of Silicon Valley are always will be silos. As heroic as Ghost has been in supporting ActivityPub that is not the web. The barriers are too high and the features too limited. The web is the web, it's well defined and well understood. And that's where we have to go, and I want the minds to be there or else it wasn't worth the effort.</p>

## UI in AI is the next frontier

date: 2025-08-08, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2021/08/07/rickAndMorty.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Yesterday I wrote a <a href="https://daveverse.org/2025/08/07/chatgpt-5-is-even-more-of-a-bastard-than-4/">quick review</a> of ChatGPT 5, after trying a simple programming exercise with it. It was an awful collaboration because it lied to me about its capabilities, leading me to develop a feature in my software to support the capability that it later admitted that it didn't have. I've never had a programming partner do that to me. I've had people who never showed up for work. Or people who were in so far over their heads that it would have been better if they had never shown up. It lied repeatedly, and when cornered it had the audacity to gaslight me. "I understand why you feel that way." Oh nothing pisses me off more than that. </p>
<p>I don't understand why <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/250807/p29#a250807p29">other people</a> don't review it based on its functionality, after all it isn't just a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/02/big-tech-ai-spending?utm_source=chatgpt.com">money sink</a>, or a technological breakthrough, it's software that we pay actual money for that is meant to help us in our work. I don't know if it's by design that it's such an asshole. I have a feeling that people are going to focus on this eventually. </p>
<p>ChatGPT is not human, it's like the world of <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22Rick%20and%20Morty%22">Rick and Morty</a>. And we're meant to be one of the many versions of Rick and/or Morty, but which is the real one? Before we lose sight of that, let's keep our heads on, we're still the ones discovering stuff and being creative and entertaining other humans, not the machines. It'll all work a lot better when they're programmed to behave like computers, not these vain and corrupt pseudo humans. Still a breakthrough in search. Really sticks it to Google. Yaaay. That's good enough for me. </p>
<p>I'm more worried about AIs killing us by overwhelming our nervous systems than taking our place at work. Has anyone actually used any of the software an AI has written? I know people who have never written software before are in awe, as I am about <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22wordle%20kitty%22">drawing</a> characters I make up, but how does the software it builds rate? If it lies to itself like it lies to me, the software doesn't work at all, even slightly. I'm pretty sure "garbage in garbage out" applies in the new world of software. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://scripting.com/2019/08/09.html#a191740">2019</a>: "I'd love to understand how one can be a programmer and not always be searching for the truth. Unlike just about any other profession I can think of, ours depends on telling the truth. You can't lie to a compiler is one of my programming mottos. Garbage in garbage out."</li>
</ul>
<p>The tech industry doesn't get its relationship with paying human customers. Had a problem with my cell phone service. I started getting emails saying it was shutting off my service because my credit card was being denied. Went to the account on the web and it looked fine. The messages kept coming. I reached out for help. The people couldn't understand what I was saying. I eventually gave up because I didn't understand either. I might have two accounts, I don't know, in some ways it looks like two, in other ways just one. I presume <i>they</i> have a way to find out, assuming there are actually any reasoning empathetic human beings who care about doing quality work. If we were talking to each other human to human, not as peripheral devices for a computer network, we might have figured it out in five minutes, instead of having the customer report it on their blog after weeks of <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=bullshit">bullshit</a> that did not uncover the truth. We still don't know how many accounts I have. </p>
<p>The company is Google. They're good at dealing with imaginary customers not real ones. If they ever understood how to communicate with people, they have forgotten. And of course there's a real possibility that all my conversations were with <i>their</i> ChatGPT. If that's true, no wonder we were running around in circles never getting the answer. </p>

## Google Project Zero Changes Its Disclosure Policy

## Increasing the VRAM allocation on AMD AI APUs under Linux

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Increasing the VRAM allocation on AMD AI APUs under Linux</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Since I saw some posts calling out the old (now deprecated) way to increase GTT memory allocations for the iGPU on AMD APUs (like the AI Max+ 395 / Strix Halo I am <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/i-clustered-four-framework-mainboards-test-huge-llms">testing in the Framework Mainboard AI Cluster</a>), I thought I'd document how to increase the VRAM allocation on such boards under Linux‚Äîin this case, Fedora:</p>

<pre><code># To remove an arg: `--remove-args`
# Calculation: `([size in GB] * 1024 * 1024) / 4.096`
sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args='amdttm.pages_limit=27648000'
sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args='amdttm.page_pool_size=27648000'
sudo reboot
</code></pre>

<p>The old way, <code>amdgpu.gttsize</code>, will throw the following warning in the kernel log:</p>

<pre><code>[    4.232151] amdgpu 0000:c1:00.0: amdgpu: [drm] Configuring gttsize via module parameter is deprecated, please use ttm.pages_limit

<p>After configuring the kernel parameters and rebooting, verify the AMD GPU driver is seeing the increased memory allocation:</p></div>

## 2025-08-07 Site structure: blog, wiki, digital garden?

date: 2025-08-07, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-08-07-site-structure-blog-wiki-digital-garden">2025-08-07 Site structure: blog, wiki, digital garden?</h1>

<p>Yes. <a class="account" href="https://toot.cat/@jayeless" title="@jayeless@toot.cat">@jayeless</a> recently wrote about <a href="https://www.jayeless.net/conversation">conversations</a>, <a href="https://www.jayeless.net/link-rot">link rot</a> and <a href="https://www.jayeless.net/small-web-blogging-platforms">small blogging platforms</a> and I mentioned how my use of the software I use for publishing this site has changed.</p>

<p>I started using it as a wiki, which is why the <a href="SiteMap">SiteMap</a> still uses &ldquo;camel case&rdquo;. I ended up foregoing the wiki page approach because my opinion and experience with a topic would keep changing and I didn‚Äôt want to keep rewriting my own pages. And so the site slowly morphed from garden style to blog style and now it‚Äôs explicitly a diary. And I guess the topic pages are in fact the tag pages where I collect the links to all the tagged pages. üò¨</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;m writing this, I&rsquo;m idly wondering whether a one-person wiki is automatically a digital garden, whether thinking about terminology is a waste of time &ndash; I used to make fun of Germans who wanted to focus on terminology first and foremost (&ldquo;Begrifflichkeiten!&rdquo;) &ndash; and whether a wiki with comments is still digital garden, and now that I&rsquo;ve thought about it for a bit I&rsquo;m tired and I think it&rsquo;s a waste of time.</p>

<p>In any case, Jessica noted that I like to update pages without rewriting them. I wrote this <a href="Odd%CE%BC">OddŒº</a> feature just for me! The &ldquo;Add&rdquo; link allows me to quickly add to the end of a page without editing the whole page. This is important when I&rsquo;m on a phone. It&rsquo;s basically the remnant of my old comment system since I kept commenting on my own pages. üòÖ I mean, there were people commenting in the past &ndash; and I&rsquo;d like to thank you all if you&rsquo;re still reading! -‚Äì but I mostly felt strange commenting on my own pages so often and I decided to embrace this.</p>

<p>I update pages on my blog by adding to them, on purpose. In terms of editorial style it fits with my goal of showing how everything is üöß <em>work in progress</em> üöß and how arriving someplace can be hard. There are enough places on the web where things look easy and clear and so this approach of mine reflects my lived reality of how I try things and then they don‚Äôt work and I come back again with more ideas or I report on how things went.</p>

<p>It reflects how I&rsquo;m failing forward through life. üòÇ</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-08-07, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I recorded a good podcast yesterday about how I develop new stuff like podcasting, and how it only works if there isn't a huge dominant platform vendor to FUD the project. That's why RSS worked, sort of -- we did get FUDded by the RDF folk, who had a few famous people on their list of co-authors, and it put a big scar on RSS when it was just starting to grow. We cleaned up their mess after a while, and then it boomed, thanks to the New York Times. This is what usually happens, in markets that are controlled by a big company. Google has that effect, so does Apple as does the W3C. They force everything to stop and go through a process that simply doesn't work, it doesn't yield innovation in the market, because it wasn't <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/08/10/howToBootstrapFederated140.html">bootstrapped</a>.  That's why I don't like the idea of "Podcasting 2.0" whatever it is. <a href="https://mastodon.social/@adam@podcastindex.social/114978962778121264">Adam Curry says</a> on Masto that it's all a big misunderstanding, but that's what the RDF people said too. Who cares what the name is. Everyone cares, when it comes to the name of a standard or protocol. And when you have an Apple or Google or IETF  trying to confuse people about what you're doing, well you can't make any progress on interop. They freeze everything because users and developers will wait for them. Of course that's what "Podcasting 2.0" is all about. To make all the ideas flow through <a href="https://podcasting2.org/">one place</a>. And whoever they are (ChatGPT <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/08/07/isTherePodcastingTwoPointOh.png">says</a> it's Adam Curry btw) they didn't even bring the power of an Apple or Google to the table. They have nothing other than their aspiration to own the name of an open format and protocol that made the world a little happier for a while. For that of course someone has to try to own it. That's basically what I said, in a very long-winded way, in the podcast. I also talked about ways we could move forward anyway even though there is a 800-pound would-be gorilla trying to own our playground. Maybe I'll just release the podcast as-is and ask you all to indulge me for my need to say the same thing far too many times with so much vigor. :-)

But when I asked it to make a sandbox for this app, which is in a repo on GitHub, rather than take the direct route, and run the demo.js app (which is what I asked it to do), it concocted a pointless user interface, that hid all the interesting bits. This was a demo for programmers for crying out loud. I <i>want</i> to show them the machinery in motion. I'm going to try again today.

## China Accuses Nvidia of Putting Backdoors into Their Chips

date: 2025-08-07, updated: 2025-08-06, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>The government of China has accused Nvidia of inserting a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/07/china-claims-nvidia-built-backdoor-into-h20-chip-designed-for-chinese-market/">backdoor</a> into their H20 chips:</p>
<blockquote><p>China&#8217;s cyber regulator on Thursday said it had held a meeting with Nvidia over what it called &#8220;serious security issues&#8221; with the company&#8217;s artificial intelligence chips. It said US AI experts had &#8220;revealed that Nvidia&#8217;s computing chips have location tracking and can remotely shut down the technology.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

## All the concerns that make you a boring developer

date: 2025-08-06, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>I was thinking this morning about how once you understand that your technology choices have security, performance, and accessibility considerations you become a much more boring developer. Acknowledging those obligations can sort of strips the fun out of programming, but we‚Äôre better for it.</p>
<p>I decided to pull on that thread a little more and come up with a list of all the concerns you might have as an engineer/developer that ultimately compound to make you a boring, wet blanket of a person to be in meetings with.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security</strong>  - Make sure you‚Äôre not opening the door for hackers.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong> - Don‚Äôt leak personal information. Or don‚Äôt collect it in the first place.</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>  - Can the software work on low-end devices? Can you deliver the large bundle over bad internet? Those are your problems.</li>
<li><strong>Inclusion/Accessibility</strong>  - Are you allowing people the dignity to use your product? No? Oof. You should probably do that. Ideally because you are an ethical person, but also because it‚Äôs a legal liability.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>  - If a thousand people show up in the next minute, does your software still work? You have 100 users now, but how does it work for 1000? 1 million? 1 billion?</li>
<li><strong>Maintenance</strong> - Ship a new feature? Great. Expect to spend at least 40% of cost/time to maintain a feature over its lifetime.</li>
<li><strong>Testability</strong>  - Did you write the code in a way that‚Äôs easy to test to make sure bugs don‚Äôt show up in production?</li>
<li><strong>Deliverability/Distribution</strong>  - How do people get or use your software?</li>
<li><strong>Adoption/Onboarding</strong>  - How do customers or partners use your software? How do they get familiar?</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> - Email and DMs is probably not the most efficient form on knowledge transfer.</li>
<li><strong>Ecological</strong>  - Does your app burn through GPUs in Iowa? What are you doing about that?</li>
<li><strong>Financial/Cost</strong>  - Servers and GPUs cost money, did you build this in such a way that it costs as little as possible to run?</li>
<li><strong>Monetizability</strong> - Good idea but does it make money or cost money?</li>
<li><strong>User feedback</strong>  - What are customers or partners saying about this? Does that impact how or what you write?</li>
<li><strong>Stakeholder feedback</strong> - Like user feedback but everyone freaks out like their job depends on solving the problem that day regardless if its a good idea or bad idea.</li>
<li><strong>Organizational</strong> - How to get your co-workers onboard with the plan plays an outsized part in software engineering. Welcome to the world of office politics!</li>
<li><strong>Staffability</strong> - There‚Äôs not a lot of Haskell developers out there. Or the inverse, people over-optimize on technologies that are ‚Äúeasy to hire for‚Äù and now you have a billion lines of Java in your application.</li>
<li><strong>Support matrixes</strong> - For websites, of course we support major browsers and the latest 2 versions? Do we need to go back further? Weirdo browsers? Should we make native apps? Which ones? What devices/CPU architectures do we support there? Niche Linux distros? The list goes on.</li>
<li><strong>Political</strong> - Some say ‚Äúall tech is political‚Äù, and I tend to agree, but ask yourself: Did you put a politics inside the code? You did, didn‚Äôt you?</li>
<li><strong>Geopolitical</strong> - Rare, but happens. See: <a href="https://erinkissane.com/meta-in-myanmar-full-series">Facebook Myanmar genocide</a></li>
<li><strong>Localization/Internationalization</strong>  - Uh-oh, your UI doesn‚Äôt work in German or Arabic. Also all your images and icons are offensive to a particular country‚Äôs monarch. Are you ready to cross the borders? Get ready for VAT tax tables, ughck.</li>
<li><strong>SEO/Crawlability</strong>  - Cool website you made, can robots get to it and index it? Now LLMs are coming and slurping up your content and traffic. Uh-oh!</li>
<li><strong>Adjacent competitors</strong>  - What your competitors are doing will always play a role in engineering. Looking better than them is good, being cheaper is good too, but one rule is the most important: never be slower. See: <a href="https://infrequently.org/2020/06/platform-adjacency-theory/">Platform adjacency theory</a></li>
<li><strong>Throughput/Velocity</strong> - How fast can you and (more importantly) your team ship an idea from conception to production. What about turnaround times on bug reports?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you ever ask a developer if an idea is possible and their brain lags out with a little loading spinner over their head, it might be this enormous pile of concerns they‚Äôre mulling over. That can be an issue, but I‚Äôd be more concerned about the developer that instantly says ‚ÄúYes‚Äù to everything. And if you‚Äôre tired of developers saying ‚ÄúNo‚Äù all the time, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ask-Your-Developer-Software-Developers/dp/0063018292">ask your developer</a> about ways to put them in situations where they can say ‚ÄúYes‚Äù.</p>

## 2025-08-06 Another month has passed in Gaza

date: 2025-08-06, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-08-06-another-month-has-passed-in-gaza">2025-08-06 Another month has passed in Gaza</h1>

<p>Everywhere I look, the news is telling me that atrocious crimes are being committed by Israel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Israel‚Äôs war in Gaza combines a staggeringly high death rate, shocking violence toward children, unparalleled physical destruction, and now a world-historical famine. The world has, by objective measure, never seen anything like this. ‚Ä¶ What we have watched, what we are continuing to watch, is the obliteration of a society of two million people. Every facet of modern civilization, as well as the most elementary things needed for even a state of basic subsistence for a human community, has been deliberately and almost completely destroyed by the Israeli military in Gaza. And now we are watching the gradual but accelerating mass die-off of the people who once lived there, through a combination of starvation, disease, and murder. &ndash; <a href="https://jacobin.com/2025/08/israel-gaza-worst-crimes-ever/">Israel‚Äôs Gaza War Is One of History‚Äôs Worst Crimes Ever</a>, by Branko Marcetic, for Jacobin</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The world is watching.</p>

<p>I remember speaking with a German accent on the streets of Portugal in the eighties and another kid immediately reacted with &ldquo;Heil Hitler!&rdquo; I was being reminded of what my Austrian ancestors had been part of. Even if they had not committed the crimes themselves. A responsibility falls not on only on those who commit the crime but on those who were there, who did not stop it, and a responsibility falls on their children and their grandchildren.</p>

<p>And remember, the genocide can still be stopped. There is a way to abort this all. To just stop perpetuating it. There is a way to walk back. Maybe not all the way back, but back to peace. To a just peace, even. To pay the reparations now. To rebuild now. To help.</p>

<p>And to every company making money in Israel, cooperating with Israel, benefiting from the genocide, closing their eyes and swallowing the bitter pill of genocide in order to make some sweet, sweet silver and gold, remember that aiding and abetting the dictators and war mongers of the past is partaking in their crimes. These companies are taking part in the genocide even if they don&rsquo;t kill a single individual.</p>

<p>Earlier this week,<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a13ba438-3b43-46dd-b332-4b81b3644da0"> the Trump administration</a> narrowed <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/techland/export-controls-arent-enough-to-beat-chinas-ai">export controls</a> on advanced semiconductors ahead of US-China trade negotiations. The administration is increasingly relying on export licenses to allow American semiconductor firms to sell their products to Chinese customers, while keeping the most powerful of them out of the hands of our military adversaries. These are the chips that power the artificial intelligence research fueling China&#8217;s technological rise, as well as the advanced military equipment underpinning Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine...</p>

A <a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/08/05/justAnswerTheQuestionPleaseDearChatgpt.html">podcast</a> I recorded this morning, prime time, while getting things done, and having ChatGPT getting in the way. It needs to become more invisible, there's no suspension of disbelief when you're working with it. I think we can do much better at finding a robot that can really augment human intelligence. This is awful stuff. We have to work on these dynamics.

Whenever you have to get something done with a company, get ready for lots of phone tag, waiting on hold, talking to bots, getting screened, trying to convince a computer that you have legitimate business, and no, what you're looking for isn't on their website (believe me I looked). The stupid thing about it is that ChatGPT is becoming more like those things every day. Companies have built awful systems for getting anything done that might eat into their profits. Google is the absolute worst. Even for services that cost real money, they absolutely will not help. You better hope everything goes perfectly if you buy their service.

## Theater UX

date: 2025-08-05, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>I saw this summer‚Äôs Marvel movie in the theater on Sunday. A bit of a last minute idea so we ended up going to the ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù movie theater across the highway. Before I continue, It‚Äôs important to understand my local cinema dynamics. We have two theaters here in Austin: <a href="https://drafthouse.com/">The Alamo Drafthouse</a> and All Other Cinemas.</p>
<p>The best place to see movies in Austin is at the Alamo Drafthouse. If you‚Äôve never been to an Alamo, I‚Äôm sorry. It‚Äôs a movie theater for people who love movies by people who love movies. They craft the entire art house experience from end-to-end. From the custom pre-screener of thematically topical clips, to the strict no late arrival and no texting policies, to custom food and drink options that match the latest blockbuster movie. A waiter brings you food, drinks, and refills so you don‚Äôt have to leave your seat. The trailers are a tight 15 minutes announcing new releases and special events where they bring back old movie classics (set to an era-appropriate soundtrack, of course). Every year they have an indie movie festival to showcase the weirdest films the industry has to offer. Going to the Alamo is a thoughtful experience through and through and they sell out nearly every show opening week. You pay more going to the Alamo of course but I think everyone would agree it‚Äôs worth it for most movies unless you‚Äôre looking for a quick n‚Äô dirty alternative.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1L3eeC2lJZs?si=i-jqBOufRqq5d9F3" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Contrast that to the ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù theater. I call it the legacy theater because this was the nice, brand new theater when I went to college 25 years ago; one of those big 24-screen nationwide chain movieplexes with a four-machine arcade and stadium seating. Six plexiglass teller windows tell the history of how popular this destination was in its time. It‚Äôs flagship theater is an enormous 4D IMAX. It of course (like the Alamo) has the push button recliners and swivel food trays. The nicest thing about the ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù theater is that there‚Äôs always open seats and that‚Äôs where the problems start to reveal themselves‚Ä¶</p>
<p>The first thing you notice at the ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù theater is that no one occupies the teller windows anymore. Instead you go inside to meet a greasy teenager who scans a QR code for the ticket you have to buy online. You go to the snack bar and load up on enormous free refill tubs of popcorn, drinks, and overpriced candy; it‚Äôs almost certainly a $50 stop. Then you go to the nearly empty theater and wonder if you walked into the wrong theater by accident. Before the movie starts you sit through the hokey pre-screen trivia and local ads and when the start time hits‚Ä¶ you watch 35 (!!!) more minutes of ads with a couple trailers mixed in. And after all that you‚Äôre out of snacks and the movie starts.</p>
<p>The user experience contrast between the two couldn‚Äôt be more stark. One is thoughtful and compounds the experience at every turn and the other is enshittified with ads. One keeps you wanting to come back and the other makes you wonder why you came here in the first place (or worse, it makes you want to leave). At least its clean, I guess. One sees attention as precious and not-to-be-disturbed, the other sees you as captured by sunk costs and a pair of monetizable eyeballs. One will sell you a fresh pizza, a popcorn, and a couple refillable sodas for $50 and the other will sell you day-old popcorn, an impossibly large cup of soda, and some Sour Patch Kids for $50‚Ä¶ after you do the math, the better experience isn‚Äôt any more expensive so it‚Äôs not even competing on price.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs no wonder why the ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù theater is always empty. I bet its owners would love to see all the seats full again. It all comes down to UX. One works hard creates a vibrant scene and fosters a culture<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> for people who like films, the other is real ‚Äúdeath of cinema‚Äù vibes. People (sometimes thousands!) put so much effort into these films to make the best film possible, only to have that experience ruined in the last mile. It‚Äôs tragic and I guess I‚Äôll just catch it when it comes to streaming.</p>
<p>In related news, last year Sony Entertainment acquired Alamo Drafthouse. I‚Äôm not sure if that makes it more or less probable that you‚Äôll be able to experience an Alamo in the future. We‚Äôll see where it goes from here. Hopefully they can continue their relentless focus on the user experience.</p>
<section class="footnotes">
<ol>
<li id="fn1">
<p>I‚Äôd be remiss if I didn‚Äôt call out the <a href="https://www.texasobserver.org/alamo-drafthouse-fantastic-fest/">#metoo and union busting issues</a> that were happening behind-the-scenes at Alamo and revealed in 2022. While Alamo has done a lot to create immense cultural capital here in Austin, that ascent has not been without enabled bad behavior. Similar issues plague Hollywood too. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">‚Ü©</a></p>

## Antisemitism is everywhere

date: 2025-08-04, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Academics, who speak scientific language, won't say "there's no antisemitism at UCLA" because they know that's not true. Antisemitism is everywhere. The question is how limiting and dangerous is it. And how often is it encountered. </p>
<p>I grew up in the 1960s in a Queens neighborhood where antisemitism was a real thing. We were blamed for World War II. If it weren't for Jews my uncle Pete would still be alive. That was the story. No doubt the kids heard that at home. </p>
<p>Antisemitism was bred into us at home. Because of all the abuse my parents and grandparents, uncles and cousins, suffered in Europe, before coming the US during the war, their own idea of what it meant to be Jewish was not entirely positive. You can't help but feel responsible in some ways for the abuse you suffer. And you can't help but pass that on to your kids. </p>
<p>There was and is a fair amount of pain associated with being Jewish in the United States. Fact.</p>
<p>But: At UCLA? Harvard? Columbia? Please.  </p>
<p>At the same time scientists can admit that there is antisemitism at these places we must also acknowledge that to single these institutions out among all, is complete utter total fucking bullshit.</p>
<p>That's a scientific appraisal, btw. Provable in peer-reviewed publications (though not submitted).</p>
<p>Antisemitism is complex. We should be hearing, openly, what exactly the case is against these universities. The government is theoretically representing the Constitution and the people of the United States. The old "no taxation without representation" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_taxation_without_representation">thing</a>. Let's hear the case in clear terms, and why the universities are supposedly so bad. </p>

It has nothing to do with my feelings. I don't have feelings about computers. It lied to me over and over just now. I said you're lying to me. "I understand why you feel that way." As if it were the all-knowing feeling-inferring god-like creature it is not. The real question for me is this -- Does Open AI program it to be this way. Think about the opportunities it has to introduce true feelings of insecurity and worthlessness. That's the purpose of gaslighting. It's evil.

## A modest proposal for new holidays to manage your digital life

date: 2025-08-04, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>The cost of being online is getting too damn high and I‚Äôm tired of pretending it‚Äôs possible to fit these tasks into a normal life. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôd like to share a modest proposal for a new set of holidays to manage our digital lives:</p>
<p>(Ahem.)</p>
<ul>
<li>A day to clear out your inboxes</li>
<li>A day to reset your passwords and delete old accounts</li>
<li>A day to fix your calendars</li>
<li>A day to cancel online service subscriptions</li>
<li>A day to manage the tags on your website</li>
<li>A day to switch out any critical apps</li>
<li>A day to backup your computer and phone</li>
<li>A day to organize your photos</li>
<li>A day to organize your music collection and playlists</li>
<li>A day to setup your new phone/computer</li>
<li>A day to try out a new app or major piece of software for your primary workflow</li>
<li>A day to delete old text messages</li>
</ul>
<p>All I‚Äôm asking for is 1/30th of a year that we end up cramming into other days. I‚Äôm willing to trade some of the B-tier holidays (Easter, Thanksgiving, etc) for this. If you work in the government please call me, it is URGENT.</p>

## ‚òÖ Substack Raised Another $100 Million, Which, I Bet, Is Already Being Flushed Down the Same Toilet as Their First $100 Million

date: 2025-08-03, updated: 2025-08-07, from: Daring Fireball

I firmly believe one could build a very nice business taking 10 percent of subscription revenue for a blogging/newsletter platform, if you could get as nice a roster of popular writers to build on the platform as Substack has. I do not think that‚Äôs a $1 billion business, though.

## The Why of Substack

date: 2025-08-03, from: Om Malik blog

Not for the first time, the newsletter platform Substack is coming under¬†criticism¬†for hosting and now (accidentally) promoting Nazi content.¬†Today,¬†John Gruber of Daring Fireball is leading this crusade. This seems to be a recurring¬†occurrence.¬†They have controversies. Many express outrage. Some leave the platform. And Substack keeps growing. Why?¬† I took a step back&#160;and asked&#160;some basic questions.&#160;The&#160;answers &#8230;

It's always a good idea to get a second opinion with AI stuff. ChatGPT may give you a convoluted answer where Claude.ai gives you a concise one.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-08-03, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

A basic question I had about the <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11752874-chatgpt-agent">ChatGPT agents</a> that I can answer now that I have the feature, is whether or not the code you create can run on a server, where you can give it a URL and make it an endpoint other networked software can call. Or if it could run periodically, say once every five minutes for a function that was creating an RSS feed anyone could subscribe to. The answer is no -- it can't do either of these things. I'm sure they could do it at a technical level, but they don't want to host applications. But now I may understand better why they want to make a web browser, I bet you will be able to call these agents from apps that run in the browser. And in their case, they might not even have to support JavaScript? Heh. A wholly different programming model? Maybe I'm overestimating how much they're biting off? I wonder if anyone at OpenAI reads this blog and might want to get me in a tighter loop, so I can be among the first to try new features like this, rather than, in this case, among the very last.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-08-03, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

One of the more depressing things in having so much code that I can easily search, is the number of times I've rewritten the same code without remembering I had written it before. Yesterday I did it knowingly, I wanted a function that could tell me if one of a set of categories applies to a WordLand draft. So I could say "don't list drafts with 'linkblog' as a category." It could have other categories, and there could be more than one category to exclude. I wanted to take the time to write perfect code for this one problem. Not dense, not particularly efficient. No matter how inefficient the code is, on today's hardware such a function couldn't use any time at all. It's fair to say I've solved this problem before, but there was always more to it. Here's the <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/d61110c1d74eb1162ebc726c09dd22f1">function</a>. Now you know something about what I think is readable, understandable, respectful of a human more than I am of the computer. I know the computer would come up with much more dense and tricky code, but it doesn't have a mind, and I do. At times it can be relaxing, I magine, to not have a mind. And btw, in a couple of years this layer of code will be obsolete. We already are able to tell the machine how to do this in human language, it understands what we mean. One tiny little but hugely significant breakthrough made possible by ChatGPT and its cousins.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-08-03, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

As you get older your memory gets less reliable. It makes programming more of a challenge because as your software gets more features, there's more to remember and at the same time you're getting older. I wonder if there isn't some way to use ChatGPT to augment the aging mind dealing with more software complexity. It's very much in line with the idea I've had for a long time of putting all my writing in an AI database so I could then ask it to edit it down to book length. Or get a table of contents of what I think and then be able to read chapter-length sections on, say platforms, or how important prior art is, or what interop makes possible, and why everyone should give back when they take from open ecosystems. Each one of those topics has lots of associated stories over the years, but I probably couldn't find most of them, but an AI database certainly could. How to set that up? I've not figured that out so far.

I grew up under the red star, and right now I&#8217;m just to the right of it, on the third and top floor of the smallest residential building in northern Manhattan.
