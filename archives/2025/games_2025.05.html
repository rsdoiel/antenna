Come: Deliverance 2, Rift of the NecroDancer, and more new games out
this week</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, updated: 2025-01-31, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>The new game releases this week are full of action in different
flavors. You can travel back in time and pick up a sword, strap on a
guitar and noodle away monsters, or fight literal boredom as you wait
for a bus to arrive. Or you can skip all that and be a spell-thirsty
witch. […]</p>

<p>Polygon covers anime pretty consistently all year round, from our
running list of the best shows of the year to the minutiae of the year’s
best anime openings. The reason is simple: We love the medium, and we
earnestly want to share that love with our readers while putting a

era</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-03, updated: 2025-02-03, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>For more than 30 years, the Civilization franchise has sold the
fantasy of commanding an empire on the world stage. You take control of
a leader and a people and you pursue the development of technology and
culture. You seize land, you fight wars, and you make your way through
thousands of years of simulated […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-02-03, updated: 2025-02-03, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Dynamax Moltres is the third Legendary we’re seeing in Max
Battles for Pokémon Go. It’s making its debut during Max Monday on
Feb. 3 from 6-7 p.m. and will be available until Feb. 10 when the Max
Battle rotation swaps. While Dynamax Moltres isn’t as hard as the very
tough Gigantamax battles we’ve seen in the past, […]</p>

<p>I don’t know if you’ve heard this recently, but the Marvel Cinematic
Universe is getting darker. Deadpool &amp; Wolverine was the MCU’s first
R-rated movie, it’s been trying to make a bloody and violent Blade movie
happen for going on a decade now, and everyone behind the scenes of
Disney Plus’ new Daredevil show can’t […]</p>

<p>When Polygon sat down with Dimension 20 stars Brennan Lee Mulligan
and Ally Beardsley last week, we mostly talked about the elephant in the
arena — their sold-out Madison Square Garden show, “Gauntlet at the
Garden.”  But we were curious about one more thing: What has their time
with the show’s core cast members (the […]</p>

<p>Doom: The Dark Ages is coming to Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on May 13.
The latest chapter in the Doom Slayer’s saga promises to be more
grounded than previous installments, with a decreased emphasis on
mid-air platforming and traversal, while placing a greater focus on
melee combat, thanks to a new parry system and a […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-02-02, updated: 2025-01-31, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>League of Legends is over 15 years old. The game is nearly old enough
to drive or vote, and its developers at Riot Games haven’t been shy
about applying retcons or reworks to champions or other aspects of the
game as needed. Even longtime players can find themselves surprised by
these overhauls. For instance, one […]</p>

<p>At this point, horror franchises are nearly as old as cinema itself.
By the release of 1931’s adaptation of Bram Stoker’s Dracula — the first
with sound — there was already a history of terrifying films in the
silent era, especially among the geniuses working within the German
Expressionism movement. The roots of horror films […]</p>

scene</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-02, updated: 2025-02-01, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>For Companion hero Iris (Heretic’s Sophie Thatcher), the movie begins
as a fairy-tale romance by way of rolling fruit: She and Josh (Jack
Quaid) lock eyes in a grocery store produce aisle. He tries to be
smooth, but fumbles and knocks over an entire display of oranges. They
laugh together, and the rest is history; […]</p>
