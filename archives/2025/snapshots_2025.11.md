<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/ollama-models-atom-feed">simonw/ollama-models-atom-feed</a></strong></p>
I setup a GitHub Actions + GitHub Pages Atom feed of scraped recent models data from the Ollama <a href="https://ollama.com/search?o=newest">latest models</a> page - Ollama remains one of the easiest ways to run models on a laptop so a new model release from them is worth hearing about.</p>
<p>I built the scraper by pasting example HTML <a href="https://claude.ai/share/c96d6bb9-a976-45f9-82c2-8599c2d6d492">into Claude</a> and asking for a Python script to convert it to Atom - here's <a href="https://github.com/simonw/ollama-models-atom-feed/blob/main/to_atom.py">the script</a> we wrote together.

Reading this fresh post from Ken Smith, I thought a good slogan for Bernie&#39;s new party (maybe they should call it that) is Build Back Better, stolen from Biden. That&#39;s going to be a popular message because everyone is quickly figuring out that we&#39;re getting the shit kicked out of us, and there&#39;s a lot of rebuilding in our future no matter what.

## Improved ways to operate a rude crawler

date: 2025-03-22, from: Marginallia log

This text is satirical in nature.
Tech news is abuzz with rude AI crawlers that forge their user-agent and ignore robots.txt. In my opinion, if this is all the AI startups can muster, they&rsquo;re losing their touch. wget can do this. You need to up your game, get that crawler really rolling coal. Flagrant disregard for externalities is an important signal to the investors that your AI startup is the one.

## The "think" tool: Enabling Claude to stop and think in complex tool use situations

date: 2025-03-21, updated: 2025-03-21, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-think-tool">The &quot;think&quot; tool: Enabling Claude to stop and think in complex tool use situations</a></strong></p>
Fascinating new prompt engineering trick from Anthropic. They use their standard tool calling mechanism to define a tool called "think" that looks something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-json"><pre>{
  <span class="pl-ent">"name"</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>think<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>,
  <span class="pl-ent">"description"</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>Use the tool to think about something. It will not obtain new information or change the database, but just append the thought to the log. Use it when complex reasoning or some cache memory is needed.<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>,
  <span class="pl-ent">"input_schema"</span>: {
    <span class="pl-ent">"type"</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>object<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>,
    <span class="pl-ent">"properties"</span>: {
      <span class="pl-ent">"thought"</span>: {
        <span class="pl-ent">"type"</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>string<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>,
        <span class="pl-ent">"description"</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>A thought to think about.<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>
      }
    },
    <span class="pl-ent">"required"</span>: [<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>thought<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>]
  }
}</pre></div>

<p>This tool <em>does nothing at all</em>.</p>
<p>LLM tools (like <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/21/anthropic-use-brave/">web_search</a>) usually involve some kind of implementation - the model requests a tool execution, then an external harness goes away and executes the specified tool and feeds the result back into the conversation.</p>
<p>The "think" tool is a no-op - there is no implementation, it just allows the model to use its existing training in terms of when-to-use-a-tool to stop and dump some additional thoughts into the context.</p>
<p>This works completely independently of the new "thinking" mechanism introduced <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/25/llm-anthropic-014/#extended-thinking-mode">in Claude 3.7 Sonnet</a>.</p>
<p>Anthropic's benchmarks show impressive improvements from enabling this tool. I fully anticipate that models from other providers would benefit from the same trick.

## Anthropic Trust Center: Brave Search added as a subprocessor

date: 2025-03-21, updated: 2025-03-21, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://app.vanta.com/anthropic/trust/iz673w96495gyjer8h78n/updates">Anthropic Trust Center: Brave Search added as a subprocessor</a></strong></p>
Yesterday I was <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/20/claude-can-now-search-the-web/">trying to figure out</a> if Anthropic has rolled their own search index for Claude's new web search feature or if they were working with a partner. Here's confirmation that they are using <a href="https://search.brave.com/">Brave Search</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anthropic's subprocessor list. As of March 19, 2025, we have made the following changes:</p>
<p>Subprocessors added:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brave Search (<a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/10684626-enabling-and-using-web-search">more info</a>)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That "more info" links to the help page for their new web search feature.</p>
<p>I confirmed this myself by prompting Claude to "<a href="https://claude.ai/share/e2beb581-b6ad-49b4-9d64-11e4691b8941">Search for pelican facts</a>" - it ran a search for "Interesting pelican facts" and the ten results it showed as citations were an exact match for <a href="https://search.brave.com/search?q=interesting+pelican+facts">that search on Brave</a>.</p>
<p>And further evidence: if you <a href="https://claude.ai/share/45348349-8cc7-4447-8d79-eae6f218eb53">poke at it a bit</a> Claude will reveal the definition of its <code>web_search</code> function which looks like this - note the <code>BraveSearchParams</code> property:</p>

## New audio models from OpenAI, but how much can we rely on them?

date: 2025-03-20, updated: 2025-03-20, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p>OpenAI announced <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-our-next-generation-audio-models/">several new audio-related API features</a> today, for both text-to-speech and speech-to-text. They're very promising new models, but they appear to suffer from the ever-present risk of accidental (or malicious) instruction following.</p>

<h4 id="gpt-4o-mini-tts">gpt-4o-mini-tts</h4>

<p><code>gpt-4o-mini-tts</code> is a brand new text-to-speech model with "better steerability". OpenAI released a delightful new playground interface for this at <a href="https://www.openai.fm/">OpenAI.fm</a> - you can pick from 11 base voices, apply instructions like "High-energy, eccentric, and slightly unhinged" and get it to read out a script (with optional extra stage directions in parenthesis). It can then provide the equivalent API code in Python, JavaScript or curl. You can share links to your experiments, <a href="https://www.openai.fm/#fa1e8762-ccf9-4f08-a468-7cc51632d0ed">here's an example</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/openai-fm.jpg" alt="User interface showing voice and script options. Voice options include Alloy, Ash, Ballad, Coral (selected), Echo, Fable, Onyx, Nova, Sage, Shimmer, Verse, and a shuffle button. Vibe section shows Dramatic (selected), Cheerleader, Calm, Professional, True Crime Buff, and a refresh button. Instructions read Voice Affect: Low, hushed, and suspenseful; convey tension and intrigue. Tone: Deeply serious and mysterious, maintaining an undercurrent of unease throughout. Pacing: Fast paced, deliberate, pausing slightly after suspenseful moments to heighten drama. Emotion: Restrained yet intense‚Äîvoice should subtly tremble or tighten at key suspenseful points. Emphasis: Highlight sensory descriptions (&quot;footsteps echoed,&quot; &quot;heart hammering,&quot; &quot;shadows melting into darkness&quot;) to amplify atmosphere. Pronunciation: Slightly elongated vowels and softened consonants for an eerie, haunting effect. Pauses: Insert meaningful pauses after phrases like &quot;only shadows melting into darkness,&quot; and especially before the final line, to enhance suspense dramatically. The script says: The night was thick with fog, wrapping the town in mist. Detective Evelyn Harper pulled her coat tighter, feeling the chill creep down her spine. She knew the town's buried secrets were rising again. (Whisper this bit:) Footsteps echoed behind her, slow and deliberate. She turned, heart racing but saw only shadows. (Now sound panicked) Evelyn steadied her breath‚Äîtonight felt different. Tonight, the danger felt personal. Somewhere nearby, hidden eyes watched her every move. Waiting. Planning. Knowing her next step. This was just the beginning.. Bottom shows DOWNLOAD, SHARE, and PLAY buttons." style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>

<p>Note how part of my script there looks like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>(Whisper this bit:)</p>

<p>Footsteps echoed behind her, slow and deliberate. She turned, heart racing, but saw only shadows.</p></blockquote>

<p>While fun and convenient, the fact that you can insert stage directions in the script itself feels like an anti-pattern to me - it means you can't safely use this for arbitrary text because there's a risk that some of that text may accidentally be treated as further instructions to the model.</p>

<p>In my own experiments I've already seen this happen: sometimes the model follows my "Whisper this bit" instruction correctly, other times it says the word "Whisper" out loud but doesn't speak the words "this bit". The results appear non-deterministic, and might also vary with different base voices.</p>

<p><code>gpt-4o-mini-tts</code> <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/pricing#transcription-and-speech-generation">costs</a> $0.60/million tokens, which OpenAI estimate as around 1.5 cents per minute.</p>

<h4 id="gpt-4o-transcribe">gpt-4o-transcribe and gpt-4o-mini-transcribe</h4>

<p><code>gpt-4o-transcribe</code> and <code>gpt-4o-mini-transcribe</code> are two new speech-to-text models, serving a similar purpose to <a href="https://github.com/openai/whisper">whisper</a> but built on top of GPT-4o and setting a "new state-of-the-art benchmark". These can be used via OpenAI's <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text">v1/audio/transcriptions API</a>, as alternative options to `whisper-1. The API is still restricted to a 25MB audio file (MP3, WAV or several other formats).</p>
<p>Any time an LLM-based model is used for audio transcription (or OCR) I worry about accidental instruction following - is there a risk that content that looks like an instruction in the spoken or scanned text might not be included in the resulting transcript?</p>
<p>In <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43426022#43427525">a comment on Hacker News</a> OpenAI's Jeff Harris said this, regarding how these new models differ from <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o-audio-preview">gpt-4o-audio-preview</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's a slightly better model for TTS. With extra training focusing on reading the script exactly as written.</p>
<p>e.g. the audio-preview model when given instruction to speak "What is the capital of Italy" would often speak "Rome". This model should be much better in that regard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"much better in that regard" sounds to me like there's still a risk of this occurring, so for some sensitive applications it may make sense to stick with whisper or other traditional text-to-speech approaches.</p>

<p>On Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffintime/status/1902822589300609400">Jeff added</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>yep fidelity to transcript is the big chunk of work to turn an audio model into TTS model. still possible, but should be quite rare</p></blockquote>

<p><code>gpt-4o-transcribe</code> is an estimated 0.6 cents per minute, and <code>gpt-4o-mini-transcribe</code> is 0.3 cents per minute.</p>

<h4 id="cardinal-sin">Mixing data and instructions remains the cardinal sin of LLMs</h4>

<p>If these problems look familiar to you that's because they are variants of the root cause behind <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/prompt-injection/">prompt injection</a>. LLM architectures encourage mixing instructions and data in the same stream of tokens, but that means there are always risks that tokens from data (which often comes from untrusted sources) may be misinterpreted as instructions to the model.</p>

<p>How much of an impact this has on the utility of these new models remains to be seen. Maybe the new training is so robust that these issues won't actually cause problems for real-world applications?</p>

<p>I remain skeptical. I expect we'll see demos of these flaws in action in relatively short order.</p>

## Claude can now search the web

date: 2025-03-20, updated: 2025-03-20, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/web-search">Claude can now search the web</a></strong></p>
Claude 3.7 Sonnet on the paid plan now has a web search tool that can be turned on as a global setting.</p>
<p>This was sorely needed. ChatGPT, Gemini and Grok all had this ability already, and despite Anthropic's excellent model quality it was one of the big remaining reasons to keep other models in daily rotation.</p>
<p>For the moment this is purely a product feature - it's available through their consumer applications but there's no indication of whether or not it will be coming to the Anthropic API. OpenAI launched the latest version of web search in their API <a href="https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-building-agents/">last week</a>.</p>
<p>Surprisingly there are no details on how it works under the hood. Is this a partnership with someone like Bing, or is it Anthropic's own proprietary index populated by their own crawlers?</p>
<p>I think it may be their own infrastructure, but I've been unable to confirm that.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong>: it's confirmed <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/21/anthropic-used-brave/">as Brave Search</a>.</em></p>
<p>Their support site offers some inconclusive hints.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/10023637-does-anthropic-crawl-data-from-the-web-and-how-can-site-owners-block-the-crawler">Does Anthropic crawl data from the web, and how can site owners block the crawler?</a> talks about their ClaudeBot crawler but the language indicates it's used for training data, with no mention of a web search index.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/10684638-blocking-and-removing-content-from-claude">Blocking and Removing Content from Claude</a> looks a little more relevant, and has a heading "Blocking or removing websites from Claude web search" which includes this eyebrow-raising tip:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Removing content from your site is the best way to ensure that it won't appear in Claude outputs when Claude searches the web.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then this bit, which <em>does</em> mention "our partners":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The noindex robots meta tag is a rule that tells our partners not to index your content so that they don‚Äôt send it to us in response to your web search query. Your content can still be linked to and visited through other web pages, or directly visited by users with a link, but the content will not appear in Claude outputs that use web search.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both of those documents were last updated "over a week ago", so it's not clear to me if they reflect the new state of the world given today's feature launch or not.</p>
<p>I got this delightful response trying out Claude search where it mistook my recent <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/4/squadron/">Squadron automata</a> for a software project:</p>

## Calling a wrap on my weeknotes

date: 2025-03-20, updated: 2025-03-20, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p>After <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/weeknotes/">192 posts</a> that ranged from weekly to roughly once-a-month, I've decided to call a wrap on my weeknotes habit. The <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2019/Sep/13/weeknotestwitter-sqlite-datasette-rure/">original goal</a> was to stay transparent during my 2019-2020 JSK fellowship, and I kept them up after that as an accountability mechanism and to get into a habit of writing regularly.</p>
<p>Over the past two years I've adopted new posting habits which are solving those problems in other ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>I post something here almost every day. I actually maintained a daily posting streak throughout 2024, which I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/2/ending-a-year-long-posting-streak/">ended in January</a>, but I'm still posting most days and plan to keep that up.</li>
<li>Every time I ship a new release of one of my projects I link to it from here. This replaces the "recent releases" section of my weeknotes.</li>
<li>I try to have a longer form piece of writing that's suitable for inclusion in <a href="https://simonw.substack.com/">my newsletter</a> at least once every two weeks. That's another accountability mechanism that's working well for me.</li>
</ul>
<p>One downside of weeknotes is that I'd sometimes save something to include in them, which could lead to several items getting bundled together in a way that reduced their potential impact as standalone posts.</p>
<p>I got to the point with weeknotes where I was feeling guilty about not keeping them up. Given the volume of content I'm publishing already that felt like a sign that they were no longer providing the value they once did!</p>
<p>I still think weeknotes are an excellent habit for anyone who wants to write more frequently and be more transparent about their work. It feels healthy to be able to end a habit that's finished serving its purpose.</p>

## OpenAI platform: o1-pro

date: 2025-03-19, updated: 2025-03-19, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/o1-pro">OpenAI platform: o1-pro</a></strong></p>
OpenAI have a new most-expensive model: o1-pro can now be accessed through their API at a hefty $150/million tokens for input and $600/million tokens for output. That's 10x the price of their o1 and o1-preview models and a full 1,000x times more expensive than their cheapest model, gpt-4o-mini!</p>
<p>Aside from that it has mostly the same features as o1: a 200,000 token context window, 100,000 max output tokens, Sep 30 2023 knowledge cut-off date and it supports function calling, structured outputs and image inputs.</p>
<p>o1-pro doesn't support streaming, and most significantly for developers is the first OpenAI model to <em>only</em> be available via their new <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses">Responses API</a>. This means tools that are built against their Chat Completions API (like my own <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a>) have to do a whole lot more work to support the new model - my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/839">issue for that is here</a>.</p>
<p>Since LLM doesn't support this new model yet I had to make do with <code>curl</code>:</p>
<pre><code>curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(llm keys get openai)" \
  -d '{
    "model": "o1-pro",
    "input": "Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle"
  }'
</code></pre>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/0439d0255360c68b8f621133860710b1">the full JSON</a> I got back - 81 input tokens and 1552 output tokens for a <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/llm-prices">total cost</a> of 94.335 cents.</p>
<p><img alt="Clearly a bird riding a bicycle. The pedals are in the wrong place and the bird doesn't quite have the majestic beak of a pelican." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/o1-pro-pelican.png" /></p>
<p>I took a risk and added <code>"reasoning": {"effort": "high"}</code> to see if I could get a better pelican with more reasoning:</p>
<pre><code>curl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(llm keys get openai)" \
  -d '{
    "model": "o1-pro",
    "input": "Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle",
    "reasoning": {"effort": "high"}
  }'
</code></pre>
<p>Surprisingly that used <em>less</em> output tokens - 1459 compared to 1552 earlier (cost: 88.755 cents) - <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/085d81e1160157572c9bd361b01374c4">producing this JSON</a> which rendered as a slightly better pelican:</p>
<p><img alt="A bit better - no pedals, so they cannot be in the wrong place. The bird has a slightly more majestic beak." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/o1-pro-high-pelican.png" /></p>
<p>It was cheaper because while it spent 960 reasoning tokens as opposed to 704 for the previous pelican it omitted the explanatory text around the SVG, saving on total output.

## Apple Restricts Pebble From Being Awesome With iPhones

date: 2025-03-19, from: Michael Tsai

Eric Migicovsky (via Dare Obasanjo, Hacker News): During Pebble v1, I learned how much harder it is to build a great smartwatch experience on iPhone than it is on Android. It sounds like things have actually gotten worse over the last 8 years. I want to set expectations accordingly. We will build a good app [&#8230;]

## Not all AI-assisted programming is vibe coding (but vibe coding rocks)

date: 2025-03-19, updated: 2025-03-19, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong>Vibe coding</strong> is having a moment. The term <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383">was coined by Andrej Karpathy</a> just a few weeks ago (on February 6th) and has since been featured <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/technology/personaltech/vibecoding-ai-software-programming.html">in the New York Times</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/is-vibe-coding-with-ai-gnarly-or-reckless-maybe-some-of-both/">Ars Technica</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/16/ai-software-coding-programmer-expertise-jobs-threat">the Guardian</a> and countless online discussions.</p>
<p>I'm concerned that the definition is already escaping its original intent. I'm seeing people apply the term "vibe coding" to all forms of code written with the assistance of AI. I think that both dilutes the term and gives a false impression of what's possible with responsible <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/ai-assisted-programming/">AI-assisted programming</a>.</p>
<p>Vibe coding is <em>not</em> the same thing as writing code with the help of LLMs!</p>
<p>To quote Andrej's <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383">original tweet</a> in full (with my emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's a new kind of coding I call "vibe coding", where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and <strong>forget that the code even exists</strong>. It's possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper so I barely even touch the keyboard.</p>
<p>I ask for the dumbest things like "decrease the padding on the sidebar by half" because I'm too lazy to find it. I "Accept All" always, I don't read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it. The code grows beyond my usual comprehension, I'd have to really read through it for a while. Sometimes the LLMs can't fix a bug so I just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away.</p>
<p><strong>It's not too bad for throwaway weekend projects, but still quite amusing</strong>. I'm building a project or webapp, but it's not really coding - I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <em>love</em> this definition. Andrej is an extremely talented and experienced programmer - he has no need for AI assistance at all. He's using LLMs like this because it's fun to try out wild new ideas, and the speed at which an LLM can produce code is an order of magnitude faster than even the most skilled human programmers. For low stakes projects and prototypes why not just <em>let it rip</em>?</p>

<p>When I talk about vibe coding I mean <strong>building software with an LLM without reviewing the code it writes</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="using-llms-for-code-responsibly-is-not-vibe-coding">Using LLMs for code responsibly is not vibe coding</h4>
<p>Let's contrast this "forget that the code even exists" approach to how professional software developers use LLMs.</p>
<p>The job of a software developer is not (just) to churn out code and features. We need to create code that demonstrably works, and can be understood by other humans (and machines), and that will support continued development in the future.</p>
<p>We need to consider performance, accessibility, security, maintainability, cost efficiency. Software engineering is all about trade-offs - our job is to pick from dozens of potential solutions by balancing all manner of requirements, both explicit and implied.</p>
<p>We also <em>need</em> to read the code. My golden rule for production-quality AI-assisted programming is that I won't commit any code to my repository if I couldn't explain exactly what it does to somebody else.</p>
<p>If an LLM wrote the code for you, and you then reviewed it, tested it thoroughly and made sure you could explain how it works to someone else that's not vibe coding, it's software development. The usage of an LLM to support that activity is immaterial.</p>
<p>I wrote extensively about my own process in <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/using-llms-for-code/">Here‚Äôs how I use LLMs to help me write code</a>. Vibe coding only describes a small subset of my approach.</p>
<h4 id="let-s-not-lose-track-of-what-makes-vibe-coding-special">Let's not lose track of what makes vibe coding special</h4>
<p>I don't want "vibe coding" to become a negative term that's synonymous with irresponsible AI-assisted programming either. This weird new shape of programming has so much to offer the world!</p>
<p>I believe <strong>everyone deserves the ability</strong> to automate tedious tasks in their lives with computers. You shouldn't need a computer science degree or programming bootcamp in order to get computers to do extremely specific tasks for you.</p>
<p>If vibe coding grants millions of new people the ability to build their own custom tools, I could not be happier about it.</p>
<p>Some of those people will get bitten by the programming bug and go on to become proficient software developers. One of the biggest barriers to that profession is the incredibly steep initial learning curve - vibe coding shaves that initial barrier down to almost flat.</p>
<p>Vibe coding also has a ton to offer experienced developers. I've talked before about how <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/using-llms-for-code/">using LLMs for code is difficult</a> - figuring out what does and doesn't work is a case of building intuition over time, and there are plenty of hidden sharp edges and traps along the way.</p>
<p>I think vibe coding is the best tool we have to help experienced developers build that intuition as to what LLMs can and cannot do for them. I've published more than <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon">80 experiments</a> I built with vibe coding and I've learned so much along the way. I would encourage any other developer, no matter their skill level, to try the same.</p>
<h4 id="when-is-it-ok-to-vibe-code-">When is it OK to vibe code?</h4>
<p>If you're an experienced engineer this is likely obvious to you already, so I'm writing this section for people who are just getting started building software.</p>
<ul>
<li>Projects should be <strong>low stakes</strong>. Think about how much harm the code you are writing could cause if it has bugs or security vulnerabilities. Could somebody be harmed - damaged reputation, lost money or something worse? This is particularly important if you plan to build software that will be used by other people!</li>
<li>Consider <strong>security</strong>. This is a really difficult one - security is a huge topic. Some high level notes:
<ul>
<li>Watch out for <strong>secrets</strong> - anything that looks similar in shape to a password, such as the API key used to access an online tool. If your code involves secrets you need to take care not to accidentally expose them, which means you need to understand how the code works!</li>
<li>Think about <strong>data privacy</strong>. If you are building a tool that has access to private data - anything you wouldn't want to display to the world in a screen-sharing session - approach with caution. It's possible to vibe code personal tools that you paste private information into but you need to be very sure you understand if there are ways that data might leave your machine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Be a <strong>good network citizen</strong>. Anything that makes requests out to other platforms could increase the load (and hence the cost) on those services. This is a reason I like <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude-artifacts/">Claude Artifacts</a> - their sandbox prevents accidents from causing harm elsewhere.</li>
<li>Is <strong>your money on the line</strong>? I've seen horror stories about people who vibe coded a feature against some API without a billing limit and racked up thousands of dollars in charges. Be very careful about using vibe coding against anything that's charged based on usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're going to vibe code anything that might be used by other people, I recommend checking in with someone more experienced for a vibe check (hah) before you share it with the world.</p>
<h4 id="how-do-we-make-vibe-coding-better-">How do we make vibe coding better?</h4>
<p>I think there are some fascinating software design challenges to be solved here.</p>
<p>Safe vibe coding for complete beginners starts with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)">sandbox</a>. Claude Artifacts was one of the first widely available vibe coding platforms and their approach to sandboxing is fantastic: code is restricted to running in a locked down <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, can load only approved libraries and can't make any network requests to other sites.</p>
<p>This makes it very difficult for people to mess up and cause any harm with their projects. It also greatly limits what those projects can do - you can't use a Claude Artifact project to access data from external APIs for example, or even to build software that runs your own prompts against an LLM.</p>
<p>Other popular vibe coding tools like Cursor (which was initially intended for professional developers) have far less safety rails.</p>
<p>There's plenty of room for innovation in this space. I'm hoping to see a cambrian explosion in tooling to help people build their own custom tools as productively and safely as possible.</p>
<h4 id="go-forth-and-vibe-code">Go forth and vibe code</h4>
<p>I really don't want to discourage people who are new to software from trying out vibe coding. The best way to learn anything is to build a project!</p>
<p>For experienced programmers this is an amazing way to start developing an intuition for what LLMs can and can't do. For beginners there's no better way to open your eyes to what's possible to achieve with code itself.</p>
<p>But please, don't confuse vibe coding with all other uses of LLMs for code.</p>

## My Thoughts on the Future of "AI"

date: 2025-03-19, updated: 2025-03-19, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2025/thoughts-on-future-ai.html">My Thoughts on the Future of &quot;AI&quot;</a></strong></p>
Nicholas Carlini, previously deeply skeptical about the utility of LLMs, discusses at length his thoughts on where the technology might go.</p>
<p>He presents compelling, detailed arguments for both ends of the spectrum - his key message is that it's best to maintain very wide error bars for what might happen next:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wouldn't be surprised if, in three to five years, language models are capable of performing most (all?) cognitive economically-useful tasks beyond the level of human experts. And I also wouldn't be surprised if, in five years, the best models we have are better than the ones we have today, but only in ‚Äúnormal‚Äù ways where costs continue to decrease considerably and capabilities continue to get better but there's no fundamental paradigm shift that upends the world order. To deny the <em>potential</em> for either of these possibilities seems to me to be a mistake.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If LLMs do hit a wall, it's not at all clear what that wall might be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I still believe there is something fundamental that will get in the way of our ability to build LLMs that grow exponentially in capability. But I will freely admit to you now that I have no earthly idea what that limitation will be. I have no evidence that this line exists, other than to make some form of vague argument that when you try and scale something across many orders of magnitude, you'll probably run into problems you didn't see coming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's lots of great stuff in here. I particularly liked this explanation of how you get R1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You take DeepSeek v3, and ask it to solve a bunch of hard problems, and when it gets the answers right, you train it to do more of that and less of whatever it did when it got the answers wrong. The idea here is actually really simple, and it works surprisingly well.</p>
</blockquote>

## Building and deploying a custom site using GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages

date: 2025-03-18, updated: 2025-03-18, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/github-actions/github-pages">Building and deploying a custom site using GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages</a></strong></p>
I figured out a minimal example of how to use GitHub Actions to run custom scripts to build a website and then publish that static site to GitHub Pages. I turned <a href="https://github.com/simonw/minimal-github-pages-from-actions/">the example</a> into a template repository, which should make getting started for a new project extremely quick.</p>
<p>I've needed this for various projects over the years, but today I finally put these notes together while setting up <a href="https://github.com/simonw/recent-california-brown-pelicans">a system</a> for scraping the <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/">iNaturalist</a> API for recent sightings of the California Brown Pelican and converting those into an Atom feed that I can subscribe to in <a href="https://netnewswire.com/">NetNewsWire</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of a Brown Pelican sighting Atom feed in NetNewsWire showing a list of entries on the left sidebar and detailed view of &quot;Brown Pelican at Art Museum, Isla Vista, CA 93117, USA&quot; on the right with date &quot;MAR 13, 2025 AT 10:40 AM&quot;, coordinates &quot;34.4115542997, -119.8500448&quot;, and a photo of three brown pelicans in water near a dock with copyright text &quot;(c) Ery, all rights reserved&quot;" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/pelicans-netnewswire.jpg" /></p>

<p>Sure enough, <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/pricing/">R2 pricing</a> charges "based on the total volume of data stored" - $0.015 / GB-month for standard storage, then $0.36 / million requests for "Class B" operations which include reads.

<p>In answer to a question about adding public transit times <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43392521#43393183">Dan said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the next year or so maybe. The biggest obstacles to adding public transit are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collecting all the necessary scheduling data (e.g. GTFS feeds) for every transit system in the county. Not insurmountable since there are services that do this currently.</li>
<li>Finding a routing engine that can compute nation-scale travel time matrices quickly. Currently, the two fastest open-source engines I've tried (OSRM and Valhalla) don't support public transit for matrix calculations and the engines that do support public transit (R5, OpenTripPlanner, etc.) are too slow.</li>
</ul>

## Mistral Small 3.1

date: 2025-03-17, updated: 2025-03-17, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://mistral.ai/fr/news/mistral-small-3-1">Mistral Small 3.1</a></strong></p>
Mistral Small 3 <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/30/mistral-small-3/">came out in January</a> and was a notable, genuinely excellent local model that used an Apache 2.0 license.</p>
<p>Mistral Small 3.1 offers a significant improvement: it's multi-modal (images) and has an increased 128,000 token context length, while still "fitting within a single RTX 4090 or a 32GB RAM MacBook once quantized" (according to their <a href="https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-Small-3.1-24B-Instruct-2503">model card</a>). Mistral's own benchmarks show it outperforming Gemma 3 and GPT-4o Mini, but I haven't seen confirmation from external benchmarks.</p>
<p>Despite their mention of a 32GB MacBook I haven't actually seen any quantized GGUF or MLX releases yet, which is a little surprising since they partnered with Ollama on launch day for their previous Mistral Small 3. I expect we'll see various quantized models released by the community shortly.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> 20th March 2025: I've now run the text version on my laptop using <a href="https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Mistral-Small-3.1-Text-24B-Instruct-2503-8bit">mlx-community/Mistral-Small-3.1-Text-24B-Instruct-2503-8bit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mlx">llm-mlx</a>:</p>
<pre><code>llm mlx download-model mlx-community/Mistral-Small-3.1-Text-24B-Instruct-2503-8bit -a mistral-small-3.1
llm chat -m mistral-small-3.1
</code></pre>
<p>The model can be accessed via Mistral's <a href="https://docs.mistral.ai/api/">La Plateforme API</a>, which means you can use it via my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mistral">llm-mistral</a> plugin.</p>
<p>Here's the model describing <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/two-pelicans.jpg">my photo of two pelicans in flight</a>:</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-mistral
# Run this if you have previously installed the plugin:
llm mistral refresh
llm -m mistral/mistral-small-2503 'describe' \
  -a https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/two-pelicans.jpg
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>The image depicts two brown pelicans in flight against a clear blue sky. Pelicans are large water birds known for their long bills and large throat pouches, which they use for catching fish. The birds in the image have long, pointed wings and are soaring gracefully. Their bodies are streamlined, and their heads and necks are elongated. The pelicans appear to be in mid-flight, possibly gliding or searching for food. The clear blue sky in the background provides a stark contrast, highlighting the birds' silhouettes and making them stand out prominently.</p>

## Backstory on the default styles for the HTML dialog modal

date: 2025-03-16, updated: 2025-03-16, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43378225#43380129">Backstory on the default styles for the HTML dialog modal</a></strong></p>
My TIL about <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/css/dialog-full-height">Styling an HTML dialog modal to take the full height of the viewport</a> (here's the <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/side-panel-dialog">interactive demo</a>) showed up <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43378225">on Hacker News</a> this morning, and attracted this fascinating comment from Chromium engineer Ian Kilpatrick.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's quite a bit of history here, but the abbreviated version is that the dialog element was originally added as a replacement for window.alert(), and there were a libraries polyfilling dialog and being surprisingly widely used.</p>
<p>The mechanism which dialog was originally positioned was relatively complex, and slightly hacky (magic values for the insets).</p>
<p>Changing the behaviour basically meant that we had to add "overflow:auto", and some form of "max-height"/"max-width" to ensure that the content within the dialog was actually reachable.</p>
<p>The better solution to this was to add "max-height:stretch", "max-width:stretch". You can see <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/5936#discussion_r513642207">the discussion for this here</a>.</p>
<p>The problem is that no browser had (and still has) shipped the "stretch" keyword. (Blink <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/SiZ2nDt3B9E/m/kP_rKOaDAgAJ?pli=1">likely will "soon"</a>)</p>
<p>However this was pushed back against as this had to go in a specification - and nobody implemented it ("-webit-fill-available" would have been an acceptable substitute in Blink but other browsers didn't have this working the same yet).</p>
<p>Hence the calc() variant. (Primarily because of "box-sizing:content-box" being the default, and pre-existing border/padding styles on dialog that we didn't want to touch). [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I particularly enjoyed this insight into the challenges of evolving the standards that underlie the web, even for something this small:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that any changes that changes web behaviour is under some time pressure. If you leave something too long, sites will start relying on the previous behaviour - so it would have been arguably worse not to have done anything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also from the comments I learned that Firefox DevTools <em>can</em> show you user-agent styles, but that option is turned off by default - <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/css/dialog-full-height#user-content-update-firefox-can-show-browser-styles">notes on that here</a>. Once I turned this option on I saw references to an <code>html.css</code> stylesheet, so I dug around and <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/style/res/html.css">found that in the Firefox source code</a>. Here's <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/commits/HEAD/layout/style/res/html.css">the commit history</a> for that file on the official GitHub mirror, which provides a detailed history of how Firefox default HTML styles have evolved with the standards over time.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43378225#43380255">via uallo</a> here are the same default HTML styles for other browsers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chromium: <a href="https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/main/third_party/blink/renderer/core/html/resources/html.css">third_party/blink/renderer/core/html/resources/html.css</a></li>
<li>WebKit: <a href="https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/blob/main/Source/WebCore/css/html.css">Source/WebCore/css/html.css</a></li>

There was a time, 1999 specifically, when writing for the web in a web browser was a strange and new idea. That era lasted until 2006 when Twitter emerged, removing almost all the features of writing and adding character limits. That had enormous impact on the political and creative worlds. The era of wood chipping people and ideas.

## mlx-community/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit

date: 2025-03-16, updated: 2025-03-16, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit">mlx-community/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit</a></strong></p>
OLMo 2 32B <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/13/ai2/">claims to be</a> "the first fully-open model (all data, code, weights, and details are freely available) to outperform GPT3.5-Turbo and GPT-4o mini". Thanks to the MLX project here's a recipe that worked for me to run it on my Mac, via my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mlx">llm-mlx</a> plugin.</p>
<p>To install the model:</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-mlx
llm mlx download-model mlx-community/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit
</code></pre>
<p>That downloads 17GB to <code>~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--mlx-community--OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit</code>.</p>
<p>To start an interactive chat with OLMo 2:</p>
<pre><code>llm chat -m mlx-community/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit
</code></pre>
<p>Or to run a prompt:</p>
<pre><code>llm -m mlx-community/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit 'Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle' -o unlimited 1
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-o unlimited 1</code> removes the cap on the number of output tokens - the default for <code>llm-mlx</code> is 1024 which isn't enough to attempt to draw a pelican.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/53f00731d494439d4aeca6bdd55368ca">pelican it drew</a> is refreshingly abstract:</p>
