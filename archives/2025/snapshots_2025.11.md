John Palfrey who is president of the MacArthur foundation, and a former colleague and friend from Berkman, and a legal scholar, writes about a crisis in the rule of law. It’s puzzling to me because I try to be informed, but don’t know what the crisis is? We need better info flow.

## Episode 153 - The Keypact Mystery

date: 2025-03-17, from: Advent of Computing

<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">When I was down at VCF SoCal I ran into a strange machine: the Keypact Micro-VIP. It's a terminal without a keyboard, covered in dials, with a speaker and a switch labeled "voice". This chance encounter with the unknown sent me down a wild path. It involved the creeping spread of computing, chicken feed, door to door life insurance salesmen, and at least one early hacker.</p>

## Backstory on the default styles for the HTML dialog modal

date: 2025-03-16, updated: 2025-03-16, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43378225#43380129">Backstory on the default styles for the HTML dialog modal</a></strong></p>
My TIL about <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/css/dialog-full-height">Styling an HTML dialog modal to take the full height of the viewport</a> (here's the <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/side-panel-dialog">interactive demo</a>) showed up <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43378225">on Hacker News</a> this morning, and attracted this fascinating comment from Chromium engineer Ian Kilpatrick.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's quite a bit of history here, but the abbreviated version is that the dialog element was originally added as a replacement for window.alert(), and there were a libraries polyfilling dialog and being surprisingly widely used.</p>
<p>The mechanism which dialog was originally positioned was relatively complex, and slightly hacky (magic values for the insets).</p>
<p>Changing the behaviour basically meant that we had to add "overflow:auto", and some form of "max-height"/"max-width" to ensure that the content within the dialog was actually reachable.</p>
<p>The better solution to this was to add "max-height:stretch", "max-width:stretch". You can see <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/5936#discussion_r513642207">the discussion for this here</a>.</p>
<p>The problem is that no browser had (and still has) shipped the "stretch" keyword. (Blink <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/SiZ2nDt3B9E/m/kP_rKOaDAgAJ?pli=1">likely will "soon"</a>)</p>
<p>However this was pushed back against as this had to go in a specification - and nobody implemented it ("-webit-fill-available" would have been an acceptable substitute in Blink but other browsers didn't have this working the same yet).</p>
<p>Hence the calc() variant. (Primarily because of "box-sizing:content-box" being the default, and pre-existing border/padding styles on dialog that we didn't want to touch). [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I particularly enjoyed this insight into the challenges of evolving the standards that underlie the web, even for something this small:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that any changes that changes web behaviour is under some time pressure. If you leave something too long, sites will start relying on the previous behaviour - so it would have been arguably worse not to have done anything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also from the comments I learned that Firefox DevTools <em>can</em> show you user-agent styles, but that option is turned off by default - <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/css/dialog-full-height#user-content-update-firefox-can-show-browser-styles">notes on that here</a>. Once I turned this option on I saw references to an <code>html.css</code> stylesheet, so I dug around and <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/style/res/html.css">found that in the Firefox source code</a>. Here's <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/commits/HEAD/layout/style/res/html.css">the commit history</a> for that file on the official GitHub mirror, which provides a detailed history of how Firefox default HTML styles have evolved with the standards over time.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43378225#43380255">via uallo</a> here are the same default HTML styles for other browsers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chromium: <a href="https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/main/third_party/blink/renderer/core/html/resources/html.css">third_party/blink/renderer/core/html/resources/html.css</a></li>
<li>WebKit: <a href="https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/blob/main/Source/WebCore/css/html.css">Source/WebCore/css/html.css</a></li>

There was a time, 1999 specifically, when writing for the web in a web browser was a strange and new idea. That era lasted until 2006 when Twitter emerged, removing almost all the features of writing and adding character limits. That had enormous impact on the political and creative worlds. The era of wood chipping people and ideas.

## mlx-community/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit

date: 2025-03-16, updated: 2025-03-16, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit">mlx-community/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit</a></strong></p>
OLMo 2 32B <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/13/ai2/">claims to be</a> "the first fully-open model (all data, code, weights, and details are freely available) to outperform GPT3.5-Turbo and GPT-4o mini". Thanks to the MLX project here's a recipe that worked for me to run it on my Mac, via my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mlx">llm-mlx</a> plugin.</p>
<p>To install the model:</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-mlx
llm mlx download-model mlx-community/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit
</code></pre>
<p>That downloads 17GB to <code>~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--mlx-community--OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit</code>.</p>
<p>To start an interactive chat with OLMo 2:</p>
<pre><code>llm chat -m mlx-community/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit
</code></pre>
<p>Or to run a prompt:</p>
<pre><code>llm -m mlx-community/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit 'Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle' -o unlimited 1
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-o unlimited 1</code> removes the cap on the number of output tokens - the default for <code>llm-mlx</code> is 1024 which isn't enough to attempt to draw a pelican.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/53f00731d494439d4aeca6bdd55368ca">pelican it drew</a> is refreshingly abstract:</p>
