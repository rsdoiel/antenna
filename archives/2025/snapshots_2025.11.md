i am sure Ezra Klein is wrong. The reason trump won is the Dems ran the country and campaign with the same weak approach Schumer demonstrated so well last week. If there were a supportable choice, I would’ve voted against them too. Sometimes people get left behind. That’s the leadership of the Dems, and it isn’t about age, Jeffries had the disease too.

## OpenTimes

date: 2025-03-17, updated: 2025-03-17, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://sno.ws/opentimes/">OpenTimes</a></strong></p>
Spectacular new open geospatial project by <a href="https://sno.ws/">Dan Snow</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OpenTimes is a database of pre-computed, point-to-point travel times between United States Census geographies. It lets you download bulk travel time data for free and with no limits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's <a href="https://opentimes.org/?id=060816135022&amp;mode=car#9.76/37.5566/-122.3085">what I get</a> for travel times by car from El Granada, California:</p>
<p><img alt="Isochrone map showing driving times from the El Granada census tract to other places in the San Francisco Bay Area" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/opentimes.jpg" /></p>
<p>The technical details are <em>fascinating</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The entire OpenTimes backend is just static Parquet files on <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/r2/">Cloudflare's R2</a>. There's no RDBMS or running service, just files and a CDN. The whole thing costs about $10/month to host and costs nothing to serve. In my opinion, this is a <em>great</em> way to serve infrequently updated, large public datasets at low cost (as long as you partition the files correctly).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure enough, <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/pricing/">R2 pricing</a> charges "based on the total volume of data stored" - $0.015 / GB-month for standard storage, then $0.36 / million requests for "Class B" operations which include reads. They charge nothing for outbound bandwidth.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>All travel times were calculated by pre-building the inputs (OSM, OSRM networks) and then distributing the compute over <a href="https://github.com/dfsnow/opentimes/actions/workflows/calculate-times.yaml">hundreds of GitHub Actions jobs</a>. This worked shockingly well for this specific workload (and was also completely free).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://github.com/dfsnow/opentimes/actions/runs/13094249792">GitHub Actions run</a> of the <a href="https://github.com/dfsnow/opentimes/blob/a6a5f7abcdd69559b3e29f360fe0ff0399dbb400/.github/workflows/calculate-times.yaml#L78-L80">calculate-times.yaml workflow</a> which uses a matrix to run 255 jobs!</p>
<p><img alt="GitHub Actions run: calculate-times.yaml run by workflow_dispatch taking 1h49m to execute 255 jobs with names like run-job (2020-01) " src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/opentimes-github-actions.jpg" /></p>
<p>Relevant YAML:</p>
<pre><code>  matrix:
    year: ${{ fromJSON(needs.setup-jobs.outputs.years) }}
    state: ${{ fromJSON(needs.setup-jobs.outputs.states) }}
</code></pre>
<p>Where those JSON files were created by the previous step, which reads in the year and state values from <a href="https://github.com/dfsnow/opentimes/blob/a6a5f7abcdd69559b3e29f360fe0ff0399dbb400/data/params.yaml#L72-L132">this params.yaml file</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The query layer uses a single DuckDB database file with <em>views</em> that point to static Parquet files via HTTP. This lets you query a table with hundreds of billions of records after downloading just the ~5MB pointer file.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a really creative use of DuckDB's feature that lets you run queries against large data from a laptop using HTTP range queries to avoid downloading the whole thing.</p>
<p>The README shows <a href="https://github.com/dfsnow/opentimes/blob/3439fa2c54af227e40997b4a5f55678739e0f6df/README.md#using-duckdb">how to use that from R and Python</a> - I got this working in the <code>duckdb</code> client (<code>brew install duckdb</code>):</p>
<pre><code>INSTALL httpfs;
LOAD httpfs;
ATTACH 'https://data.opentimes.org/databases/0.0.1.duckdb' AS opentimes;

SELECT origin_id, destination_id, duration_sec
  FROM opentimes.public.times
  WHERE version = '0.0.1'
      AND mode = 'car'
      AND year = '2024'
      AND geography = 'tract'
      AND state = '17'
      AND origin_id LIKE '17031%' limit 10;
</code></pre>
<p>In answer to a question about adding public transit times <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43392521#43393183">Dan said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the next year or so maybe. The biggest obstacles to adding public transit are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collecting all the necessary scheduling data (e.g. GTFS feeds) for every transit system in the county. Not insurmountable since there are services that do this currently.</li>
<li>Finding a routing engine that can compute nation-scale travel time matrices quickly. Currently, the two fastest open-source engines I've tried (OSRM and Valhalla) don't support public transit for matrix calculations and the engines that do support public transit (R5, OpenTripPlanner, etc.) are too slow.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gtfs.org/">GTFS</a> is a popular CSV-based format for sharing transit schedules - here's <a href="https://gtfs.org/resources/data/">an official list</a> of available feed directories.

## Mistral Small 3.1

date: 2025-03-17, updated: 2025-03-17, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://mistral.ai/fr/news/mistral-small-3-1">Mistral Small 3.1</a></strong></p>
Mistral Small 3 <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/30/mistral-small-3/">came out in January</a> and was a notable, genuinely excellent local model that used an Apache 2.0 license.</p>
<p>Mistral Small 3.1 offers a significant improvement: it's multi-modal (images) and has an increased 128,000 token context length, while still "fitting within a single RTX 4090 or a 32GB RAM MacBook once quantized" (according to their <a href="https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-Small-3.1-24B-Instruct-2503">model card</a>). Mistral's own benchmarks show it outperforming Gemma 3 and GPT-4o Mini, but I haven't seen confirmation from external benchmarks.</p>
<p>Despite their mention of a 32GB MacBook I haven't actually seen any quantized GGUF or MLX releases yet, which is a little surprising since they partnered with Ollama on launch day for their previous Mistral Small 3. I expect we'll see various quantized models released by the community shortly.</p>
<p>The model <em>is</em> available via their <a href="https://docs.mistral.ai/api/">La Plateforme API</a>, which means you can access it via my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mistral">llm-mistral</a> plugin.</p>
<p>Here's the model describing <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/two-pelicans.jpg">my photo of two pelicans in flight</a>:</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-mistral
# Run this if you have previously installed the plugin:
llm mistral refresh
llm -m mistral/mistral-small-2503 'describe' \
  -a https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/two-pelicans.jpg
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>The image depicts two brown pelicans in flight against a clear blue sky. Pelicans are large water birds known for their long bills and large throat pouches, which they use for catching fish. The birds in the image have long, pointed wings and are soaring gracefully. Their bodies are streamlined, and their heads and necks are elongated. The pelicans appear to be in mid-flight, possibly gliding or searching for food. The clear blue sky in the background provides a stark contrast, highlighting the birds' silhouettes and making them stand out prominently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/commit/f528e115e3fc487e3f5c5435d7cc04dd7314dd91">added Mistral's API prices</a> to my <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/llm-prices">tools.simonwillison.net/llm-prices</a> pricing calculator by pasting screenshots of <a href="https://mistral.ai/products/la-plateforme#pricing">Mistral's pricing</a> tables <a href="https://claude.ai/share/a9313f0d-274c-48d2-9d77-346fe68556a5">into Claude</a>.

## Episode 153 - The Keypact Mystery

date: 2025-03-17, from: Advent of Computing

<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">When I was down at VCF SoCal I ran into a strange machine: the Keypact Micro-VIP. It's a terminal without a keyboard, covered in dials, with a speaker and a switch labeled "voice". This chance encounter with the unknown sent me down a wild path. It involved the creeping spread of computing, chicken feed, door to door life insurance salesmen, and at least one early hacker.</p>

## Backstory on the default styles for the HTML dialog modal

date: 2025-03-16, updated: 2025-03-16, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43378225#43380129">Backstory on the default styles for the HTML dialog modal</a></strong></p>
My TIL about <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/css/dialog-full-height">Styling an HTML dialog modal to take the full height of the viewport</a> (here's the <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/side-panel-dialog">interactive demo</a>) showed up <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43378225">on Hacker News</a> this morning, and attracted this fascinating comment from Chromium engineer Ian Kilpatrick.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's quite a bit of history here, but the abbreviated version is that the dialog element was originally added as a replacement for window.alert(), and there were a libraries polyfilling dialog and being surprisingly widely used.</p>
<p>The mechanism which dialog was originally positioned was relatively complex, and slightly hacky (magic values for the insets).</p>
<p>Changing the behaviour basically meant that we had to add "overflow:auto", and some form of "max-height"/"max-width" to ensure that the content within the dialog was actually reachable.</p>
<p>The better solution to this was to add "max-height:stretch", "max-width:stretch". You can see <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/5936#discussion_r513642207">the discussion for this here</a>.</p>
<p>The problem is that no browser had (and still has) shipped the "stretch" keyword. (Blink <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/SiZ2nDt3B9E/m/kP_rKOaDAgAJ?pli=1">likely will "soon"</a>)</p>
<p>However this was pushed back against as this had to go in a specification - and nobody implemented it ("-webit-fill-available" would have been an acceptable substitute in Blink but other browsers didn't have this working the same yet).</p>
<p>Hence the calc() variant. (Primarily because of "box-sizing:content-box" being the default, and pre-existing border/padding styles on dialog that we didn't want to touch). [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I particularly enjoyed this insight into the challenges of evolving the standards that underlie the web, even for something this small:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that any changes that changes web behaviour is under some time pressure. If you leave something too long, sites will start relying on the previous behaviour - so it would have been arguably worse not to have done anything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also from the comments I learned that Firefox DevTools <em>can</em> show you user-agent styles, but that option is turned off by default - <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/css/dialog-full-height#user-content-update-firefox-can-show-browser-styles">notes on that here</a>. Once I turned this option on I saw references to an <code>html.css</code> stylesheet, so I dug around and <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/style/res/html.css">found that in the Firefox source code</a>. Here's <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/commits/HEAD/layout/style/res/html.css">the commit history</a> for that file on the official GitHub mirror, which provides a detailed history of how Firefox default HTML styles have evolved with the standards over time.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43378225#43380255">via uallo</a> here are the same default HTML styles for other browsers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chromium: <a href="https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/main/third_party/blink/renderer/core/html/resources/html.css">third_party/blink/renderer/core/html/resources/html.css</a></li>
<li>WebKit: <a href="https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/blob/main/Source/WebCore/css/html.css">Source/WebCore/css/html.css</a></li>

That era lasted until 2006 when Twitter emerged, removing almost all the features of writing and adding character limits. That had enormous impact on the political and creative worlds. The era of wood chipping people and ideas.

OLMo 2 32B <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/13/ai2/">claims to be</a> "the first fully-open model (all data, code, weights, and details are freely available) to outperform GPT3.5-Turbo and GPT-4o mini". Thanks to the MLX project here's a recipe that worked for me to run it on my Mac, via my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mlx">llm-mlx</a> plugin.</p>
<p>To install the model:</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-mlx
llm mlx download-model mlx-community/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit
</code></pre>
<p>That downloads 17GB to <code>~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--mlx-community--OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit</code>.</p>
<p>To start an interactive chat with OLMo 2:</p>
<pre><code>llm chat -m mlx-community/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit
</code></pre>
<p>Or to run a prompt:</p>
<pre><code>llm -m mlx-community/OLMo-2-0325-32B-Instruct-4bit 'Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle' -o unlimited 1
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-o unlimited 1</code> removes the cap on the number of output tokens - the default for <code>llm-mlx</code> is 1024 which isn't enough to attempt to draw a pelican.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/53f00731d494439d4aeca6bdd55368ca">pelican it drew</a> is refreshingly abstract:</p>
