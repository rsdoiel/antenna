<p>Sometimes we lose our passion — the fire burning inside that pushes us through adverse and difficult times during our screenwriting journeys.&nbsp;<br><br>It doesn’t matter if you’re a beginner learning the ins and outs of writing a screenplay, an experienced screenwriter with some major contest and fellowship wins, or a seasoned pro earning money and seeing your name on the screen. Sometimes the passion dims, the words don’t come, the cursor blinks back at you in quiet judgement on an empty page, and you begin to question if you’ve lost <em>it</em> for good — or, if you ever really had <em>it</em> at all. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>Don’t worry. Breathe. <span style="font-weight: bold;">You haven’t lost your fire</span>. It’s still there.&nbsp;<br><br>The key to any successful run at a career in screenwriting is to learn how to get the fire back — how to reignite those creative and inspirational flames to a point where the ideas, visuals, words, and story/character solutions come flowing out of you through your fingers, onto those keys, and onto the pages.&nbsp;<br><br>Here are some tested, implemented, and proven ways to reignite your screenwriting fire! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

## The Martian Contingency by Mary Robinette Kowal: Review by Adrienne Martini

<p><strong>The Martian Contingency</strong>, Mary Robinette Kowal (Tor 978-1-2502-3705-7, $18.99, 400 pp, tp) March 2025.</p>
<p>My response to a new Mary Robinette Kowal book is similar to my response to a new John Scalzi title: I resist the first few chapters (even though I know they will be well-crafted) and then find myself completely sucked in.</p>
