benchmarks trade mixed as investors continue to eye Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Tokyo — Global shares traded mixed on Monday as investors continued
to watch economic data and policy moves from U.S. President Donald
Trump, as both are likely to impact upcoming central bank moves.</p>
<p>France’s CAC 40 dipped nearly 0.1% in early trading to 8,171.59,
while Germany’s DAX added 0.4% to 22,560.00. Britain’s FTSE 100 edged up
0.1% to 8,742.97.</p>
<p>U.S. markets are closed on Monday for a holiday.</p>
<p>In Asia, Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 rose in early trading after the
Cabinet Office reported that the economy grew at a better-than-expected
annual rate of 2.8% in October-December, underlined by steady exports
and moderate consumption. But the benchmark quickly fell back and then
recovered to be little changed, finishing up less than 0.1% at
39,174.25.</p>
<p>On a quarter-to-quarter basis, the world’s fourth-largest economy
grew 0.7% for its third straight quarter of growth. Japan marked its
fourth straight year of expansion, eking out 0.1% growth last year in
seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product, which measures the
value of a nation’s products and services.</p>
<p>In other regional markets, Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 slipped 0.2%
to 8,537.10. South Korea’s Kospi surged 0.8% to 2,610.42. Hong Kong’s
Hang Seng reversed course, to slip less than 0.1% to 22,616.23, while
the Shanghai Composite added 0.3% to 3,355.83.</p>
<p>Markets around the world are nervously watching what upward pressure
may come from tariffs that Trump has announced recently. But analysts
now think Trump may ultimately avoid triggering a punishing global trade
war.</p>
<p>His most recent tariff announcement, for example, won’t take full
effect for at least several weeks. That leaves time for Washington and
other countries to negotiate.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve’s goal, as well as that of the Bank of Japan, is
to keep inflation at 2%.</p>
<p>In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude added 28 cents to $71.02 a
barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 34 cents to $75.08
a barrel.</p>
<p>In currency trading, the U.S. dollar declined to 151.90 Japanese yen
from 152.25 yen. The euro cost $1.0472, down from $1.0495.</p>

id="life-threatening-cold-expected-in-some-parts-of-us-after-deadly-weekend-flooding">‘Life-threatening
cold’ expected in some parts of US after deadly weekend flooding</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Louisville, Kentucky — Harsh weather moved west on Monday as a polar
vortex was expected to grip the Rockies and the northern Plains after
winter storms pummeled the eastern United States over the weekend,
killing at least 10 people, including nine victims in Kentucky who died
during flooding from heavy rains.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service warned of “life-threatening cold” into
Tuesday, with temperatures in northeastern Montana predicted to dip as
low as -42.7 degrees Celsius (45 degrees below zero) with wind chills
down to -51 degrees Celsius (60 below).</p>
<p>Meteorologists said several states would experience the 10th and
coldest polar vortex event this season. Weather forces in the Arctic are
combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole
into the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>In Kentucky, Gov. Andy Beshear said Sunday that the death toll rose
to nine.</p>
<p>“I am sad to share some more tough news tonight, Kentucky. We just
confirmed another weather-related death out of Pike County, bringing our
total loss to 9 people.”</p>
<p>Beshear had said earlier Sunday that at least 1,000 people stranded
by floods had to be rescued. President Donald Trump approved Kentucky’s
request for a disaster declaration, authorizing the Federal Emergency
Management Agency to coordinate relief efforts throughout the state.</p>
<p>Beshear said most of the deaths, including a mother and 7-year-old
child, were caused by cars getting stuck in high water.</p>
<p>“So folks, stay off the roads right now and stay alive,” he said.</p>
<p>Parts of Kentucky and Tennessee received up to 15 centimeters (6
inches) of rain, said Bob Oravec, a senior forecaster with the National
Weather Service.</p>
<p>“The effects will continue for a while, a lot of swollen streams and
a lot of flooding going on,” Oravec said Sunday.</p>
<p>In Alabama, the weather service in Birmingham said it had confirmed
an EF-1 tornado touched down in Hale County. Storms there and elsewhere
in the state destroyed or damaged a handful of mobile homes, downed
trees and toppled power lines, but no injuries were immediately
reported.</p>
<p>A state of emergency was declared for parts of Obion County,
Tennessee, after a levee failed on Saturday, flooding the small
community of Rives, home to around 300 people in the western part of the
state. “There will be mandatory evacuations in effect for the residents
in Rives due to the rising water, no electricity, and freezing
temperatures creating a life-threatening situation,” Mayor Steve Carr
said in a statement Sunday.</p>
<p>In Atlanta, a person was killed when a large tree fell on a home
early Sunday, according to Atlanta Fire Rescue Capt. Scott Powell.</p>
<p>Dangerously cold wind chill temperatures as low as minus 45.6 (50
degrees below zero) were expected in most of North Dakota, which
remained under an “extreme cold warning” along with large swaths of
South Dakota and Minnesota, according to the weather service.</p>
<p>Severe flooding</p>
<p>Water submerged cars and buildings in Kentucky and mudslides blocked
roads in Virginia over the weekend. Flood warnings extended throughout
Tennessee and Arkansas.</p>
<p>The mother and child were swept away Saturday night in Kentucky’s
Bonnieville community, Hart County Coroner Tony Roberts said. In
southeastern Kentucky, a 73-year-old man was found dead in floodwaters
in Clay County, county Emergency Management Deputy Director Revelle
Berry said. There was a total of four deaths in Hart County, Beshear
said.</p>
<p>The Kentucky River Medical Center in the city of Jackson said it had
closed its emergency department and transferred all patients to two
other hospitals in the region due to a nearby river flooding.</p>
<p>High winds brought down trees and power poles across Albemarle
County, Virginia. The Charlottesville Police Department said Sunday on
social media that officers’ response times could be delayed due to “an
overwhelming number of weather-related calls for service.” Police urged
residents to stay off the roads.</p>
<p>Power outages were reported along much of the eastern seaboard, from
New York south to Georgia.</p>
<p>In West Virginia, 13 southern counties were under a state of
emergency for flooding and some areas were cut off to vehicle traffic
Sunday. Several volunteer fire departments dealt with flooding in their
own buildings while answering rescue and evacuation calls.</p>
<p>Parts of US hit with snowstorms, polar vortex on the way</p>
<p>Ice and snow made road travel treacherous in large swaths of
Michigan, which remained under a winter weather advisory until Monday
afternoon. Michigan State Police reported 114 crashes Sunday around the
Detroit area since snow started falling Saturday.</p>
<p>“Fortunately, most were one-car spin outs and there were no serious
injuries,” Michigan State Police said on X.</p>
<p>Authorities in Colorado reported eight people were killed in fatal
vehicle crashes since Valentine’s Day and warned drivers to be cautious
as the weather made driving more difficult. The causes of the fatal
crashes weren’t immediately known.</p>
<p>Also in Colorado, three state patrol cruisers that had pulled over
along roadsides were struck by other vehicles, including one on Sunday
where a trooper had stopped as officials prepared to close a road
because of ice. In each case the troopers were out of their cruisers at
the time and were uninjured.</p>
<p>Avalanche warnings were issued for numerous areas of the Rocky
Mountains stretching from Colorado to Washington state, with the danger
rated highest in Utah.</p>

visits Saudi Arabia as Israel, Hamas move closer to end of first phase
of ceasefire</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was in Saudi Arabia on Monday as
part of a tour of the region that includes a focus on the ceasefire
between Israel and Hamas.</p>
<p>Rubio was expected to meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin
Salman amid objections from Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations about
U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to move Palestinians out of
Gaza.</p>
<p>Trump has suggested the Palestinians would go to neighboring
countries, with the United States taking over Gaza and redeveloping the
territory.</p>
<p>Such a plan would seemingly eliminate Trump’s hopes of getting Saudi
Arabia to normalize ties with Israel, a move Saudi officials have said
will not happen unless there is a pathway for a Palestinian state.</p>
<p>The United States fully endorsed Israel’s war aims in Gaza on Sunday,
with Rubio saying that Hamas “must be eradicated” and “cannot continue
as a military or government force.”</p>
<p>With the first phase of the ceasefire set to expire in two weeks,
Rubio told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a stop in
Jerusalem that “as long as [Hamas] stands as a force that can govern or
as a force that can administer or as a force that can threaten by use of
violence, peace becomes impossible.”</p>
<p>Echoing Trump, the Israeli leader said “the gates of hell would be
open” if Hamas does not release dozens of remaining hostages abducted in
its Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war.</p>
<p>Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, freed three hostages
Saturday in exchange for nearly 400 Palestinians who had been jailed in
Israel. But the militants continue to hold dozens of hostages they
captured in the terror attack that killed 1,200 people.</p>
<p>Israel’s counteroffensive during 15 months of fighting in Gaza has
killed more than 48,200 Palestinians, according to the territory’s
health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and
civilians. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants.</p>
<p>The tentative second phase of the ceasefire plan calls for Hamas to
release dozens of remaining hostages in exchange for more Palestinian
prisoners, drafting of a permanent truce and the withdrawal of Israeli
forces. But the detailed terms of the deal have yet to be
negotiated.</p>
<p>During his tour of the region, Rubio was not scheduled to meet with
any Palestinian officials.</p>
<p>Egypt says it is hosting an Arab summit on February 27, and is
working with other countries on a counterproposal that would allow for
Gaza to be rebuilt without removing its population. Human rights groups
say the expulsion of Palestinians would likely violate international
law.</p>
<p>Arab nations have long called for creation of an independent
Palestinian state to exist alongside Israel, which the U.S. has also
supported. But Netanyahu opposes a two-state solution and U.S. ownership
of Gaza also would likely end the possibility of a Palestinian state
encompassing Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.</p>
<p>Egypt has warned that any mass influx of Palestinians from Gaza would
undermine its nearly half-century-old peace treaty with Israel, a
cornerstone of American influence in the region.</p>
<p>Some material in this report came from The Associated Press and
Reuters.</p>

id="china-urges-us-to-correct-its-mistakes-after-state-department-removes-taiwan-web-reference">China
urges US to ‘correct its mistakes’ after State Department removes Taiwan
web reference</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BEIJING/TAIPEI — China on Monday urged the United States to “correct
its mistakes” after the U.S. State Department removed previous wording
on its website about not supporting Taiwan independence, which it said
was part of a routine update.</p>
<p>The fact sheet on Taiwan, updated last week, retains Washington’s
opposition to unilateral change from either Taiwan or from China, which
claims the democratically governed island as its own.</p>
<p>But as well as dropping the phrase “we do not support Taiwan
independence,” the page added a reference to Taiwan’s cooperation with a
Pentagon technology and semiconductor development project and says the
U.S. will support Taiwan’s membership in international organizations
“where applicable.”</p>
<p>Beijing regularly denounces any international recognition of Taiwan
or contact between Taiwanese and foreign officials, viewing it as
encouraging Taiwan’s separate status from China.</p>
<p>The update to the website came roughly three weeks after U.S.
President Donald Trump was sworn in to his second term in the White
House.</p>
<p>Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun
said the revisions for Taiwan on the U.S. State Department’s website
were a big step backwards and “sends a seriously wrong message to Taiwan
independence separatist forces.”</p>
<p>“This is yet another example of the United States’ stubborn adherence
to the erroneous policy of ‘using Taiwan to suppress China’. We urge the
United States side to immediately rectify its mistakes,” Guo said.</p>
<p>The United States, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties
with Taiwan but is its strongest international backer, bound by law to
provide the island with the means to defend itself.</p>
<p>“As is routine, the fact sheet was updated to inform the general
public about our unofficial relationship with Taiwan,” a State
Department spokesperson said in an email sent late Sunday Taiwan time
responding to questions on the updated website wording.</p>
<p>“The United States remains committed to its one China policy,” the
spokesperson said, referring to Washington officially taking no position
on Taiwan’s sovereignty and only acknowledging China’s position on the
subject.</p>
<p>“The United States is committed to preserving peace and stability in
the Taiwan Strait,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>“We oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo from either side.
We support cross-Strait dialog, and we expect cross-Strait differences
to be resolved by peaceful means, free from coercion, in a manner
acceptable to people on both sides of the Strait.”</p>
<p>On Sunday, Taiwan Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung expressed his
appreciation for what he called the “support and positive stance on
U.S.-Taiwan relations.”</p>
<p>Taiwan’s government rejects Beijing’s sovereignty claims, saying that
only the island’s people can decide their future.</p>
<p>Taiwan says it is already an independent country called the Republic
of China, its official name. The Republican government fled to Taiwan in
1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong’s communists, who set up
the People’s Republic of China.</p>

Simon, Sabrina Carpenter open ‘Saturday Night Live’ 50th anniversary
celebration</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Paul Simon and Sabrina Carpenter opened the 50th
anniversary special celebrating “Saturday Night Live” with a duet of his
song “Homeward Bound.”</p>
<p>The 83-year-old Simon has been a constant on “SNL” since its earliest
episodes in 1975 and performed on the first show after the 9/11 attack.
He was joined by the 25-year-old pop sensation of the moment,
Carpenter.</p>
<p>“I sang this song with George Harrison on ‘Saturday Night Live’ in
1976,” Simon said.</p>
<p>“I was not born then,” Carpenter said, getting a laugh. “And neither
were my parents,” she added, getting a bigger laugh.</p>
<p>Fifty seasons of “Saturday Night Live” sketches, songs and special
guests are being celebrated for the special’s landmark anniversary in a
Sunday night special.</p>
<p>The pop culture juggernaut has launched the careers of generations of
comedians, from Bill Murray to Eddie Murphy and Tina Fey to Kristen
Wiig.</p>
<p>Many of those stars were on hand for “SNL50: The Anniversary
Celebration,” airing live from New York, of course.</p>
<p>“I grew up with the show, you know, and I was born in 1971, and it’s
lived with me my whole life,” Amy Poehler, who was a cast member from
2001 to 2008,” said on Sunday ahead of the show’s start. “We have a show
to do in just under two hours, and being back is an amazing
privilege.”</p>
<p>The three-hour extravaganza comes after months of celebrations of
“Saturday Night Live,” which premiered Oct. 11, 1975, with an original
cast that included John Belushi, Chevy Chase and Gilda Radner.</p>
<p>“After the original cast, we were just going, Those guys just did it
all for us,” Adam Sandler, a cast member from 1990-1995, said before the
show. “They crushed it. We watched them at home. They made their movies.
We worshiped their movies. And that’s all. What we wanted to do is just
kind of continue that sort of stuff.”</p>
<p>It’s become appointment television over the years as the show has
skewered presidents, politics and pop culture and been a platform for
the biggest musical stars of the moment. As streaming has altered
television viewing, “SNL” sketches, host monologues and short comedy
films remain popular on social media and routinely rack up millions of
views on YouTube.</p>
<p>While NBC has revealed some of the stars expected to appear, many of
the special’s moments, cameos and music performances remain a
surprise.</p>
<p>On Sunday, NBC announced more guest appearances including Julia
Louis-Dreyfus, Leslie Jones, Billy Crystal, Cher, Mike Myers and Alec
Baldwin, who holds the title of the person who’s hosted “SNL” the most
times.</p>

id="trump-administration-turns-to-us-supreme-court-in-bid-to-fire-agency-head">Trump
administration turns to US Supreme Court in bid to fire agency head</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>President Donald Trump’s administration has asked the U.S. Supreme
Court to intervene in its bid to fire the head of an independent U.S.
agency that protects government whistleblowers, bringing its first legal
battle involving Trump’s actions to the nation’s highest judicial body
since he took office in January.</p>
<p>The Justice Department asked the court to immediately lift a federal
judge’s Feb. 12 order that temporarily blocked Trump’s removal of
Hampton Dellinger as the head of the Office of Special Counsel while
litigation continues in the dispute, according to a copy of the filing
reviewed by Reuters. The case has not yet been docketed by the
court.</p>
<p>The federal judge’s action blocking the termination is an
“unprecedented assault on the separation of powers,” Acting Solicitor
General Sarah Harris said in the filing.</p>
<p>“This court should not allow lower courts to seize executive power by
dictating to the President how long he must continue employing an agency
head against his will,” Harris wrote.</p>
<p>Appointed by former President Joe Biden, Dellinger’s five-year term
was set to expire in 2029. He sued after receiving an email on Feb. 7
informing him that Trump had fired him from the watchdog role,
“effective immediately.”</p>
<p>Dellinger’s lawsuit said Trump exceeded his power in purporting to
fire him, given that federal law permits removal only for “inefficiency,
neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”</p>
<p>The Special Counsel’s “ability to protect the civil service and
investigate alleged misconduct is needed now more than ever,”
Dellinger’s lawsuit said. “Over the preceding three weeks, an
unprecedented number of federal employees with civil service protections
have been terminated without cause.”</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington, D.C. issued a
temporary restraining order on Feb. 12, restoring Dellinger to his
position pending a further, preliminary order.</p>
<p>Jackson said Dellinger was likely to prevail in the suit given that
the effort to fire him without identifying any cause “plainly
contravenes” the Special Counsel’s job protections under federal
law.</p>
<p>“This language expresses Congress’s clear intent to ensure the
independence of the Special Counsel and insulate his work from being
buffeted by the winds of political change,” Jackson wrote in the
order.</p>
<p>The District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the
administration’s appeal in a 2-1 decision on Saturday, saying it was
premature, given that Jackson’s order was only temporary.</p>
<p>The Special Counsel Office allows whistleblowers to make disclosures
about alleged misconduct within federal agencies and investigates
complaints of retaliation. It also enforces a U.S. law known as the
Hatch Act that limits political participation by federal employees.</p>
<p>The move to fire Dellinger was the latest by the Trump administration
to expel officials who investigate wrongdoing within the federal
government. Trump last month fired 17 inspectors general who serve as
independent watchdogs within their agencies, without providing a
reason.</p>

race to discover depth of ocean damage from Los Angeles wildfires</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — On a recent Sunday, Tracy Quinn drove down the Pacific
Coast Highway to assess damage wrought upon the coastline by the
Palisades Fire.</p>
<p>The water line was darkened by ash. Burnt remnants of washing
machines and dryers and metal appliances were strewn about the
shoreline. Sludge carpeted the water’s edge. Waves during high tide
lapped onto charred homes, pulling debris and potentially toxic ash into
the ocean as they receded.</p>
<p>“It was just heartbreaking,” said Quinn, president and CEO of the
environmental group Heal the Bay, whose team has reported ash and debris
some 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of the Palisades burn area west of
Los Angeles.</p>
<p>As crews work to remove potentially hundreds of thousands of tons of
hazardous materials from the Los Angeles wildfires, researchers and
officials are trying to understand how the fires on land have impacted
the sea. The Palisades and Eaton fires scorched thousands of homes,
businesses, cars and electronics, turning everyday items into hazardous
ash made of pesticides, asbestos, plastics, lead, heavy metals and
more.</p>
<p>Since much of it could end up in the Pacific Ocean, there are
concerns and many unknowns about how the fires could affect life under
the sea.</p>
<p>“We haven’t seen a concentration of homes and buildings burned so
close to the water,” Quinn said.</p>
<p>Fire debris and potentially toxic ash could make the water unsafe for
surfers and swimmers, especially after rainfall that can transport
chemicals, trash and other hazards into the sea. Longer term, scientists
worry if and how charred urban contaminants will affect the food
supply.</p>
<p>The atmospheric river and mudslides that pummeled the Los Angeles
region last week exacerbated some of those fears.</p>
<p>When the fires broke out in January, one of Mara Dias’ first concerns
was ocean water contamination. Strong winds were carrying smoke and ash
far beyond the blazes before settling at sea, said the water quality
manager for the Surfrider Foundation, an environmental nonprofit.</p>
<p>Scientists on board a research vessel during the fires detected ash
and waste on the water as far as 100 miles (161 kilometers) offshore,
said marine ecologist Julie Dinasquet with the University of California,
San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Things like twigs and
shard. They described the smell as electronics burning, she recalled,
“not like a nice campfire.”</p>
<p>Runoff from rain also is a huge and immediate concern. Rainfall picks
up contaminants and trash while flushing toward the sea through a
network of drains and rivers. That runoff could contain “a lot of
nutrients, nitrogen and phosphate that end up in the ash of the burn
material that can get into the water,” said Dias, as well as “heavy
metals, something called PAHs, which are given off when you burn
different types of fuel.”</p>
<p>Mudslides and debris flows in the Palisades Fire burn zone also can
dump more hazardous waste into the ocean. After fires, the soil in burn
scars is less able to absorb rainfall and can develop a layer that
repels water from the remains of seared organic material. When there is
less organic material to hold the soil in place, the risks of mudslides
and debris flows increase.</p>
<p>Los Angeles County officials, with help from other agencies, have set
thousands of feet of concrete barriers, sandbags, silt socks and more to
prevent debris from reaching beaches. The LA County Board of Supervisors
also recently passed a motion seeking state and federal help to expand
beach clean ups, prepare for storm runoff and test ocean water for
potential toxins and chemicals, among other things.</p>
<p>Beyond the usual samples, state water officials and others are
testing for total and dissolved metals such as arsenic, lead and
aluminum and volatile organic compounds.</p>
<p>They also are sampling for microplastics, polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, or PAHs, that are harmful to human and aquatic life, and
polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, a group of man-made chemicals shown
to cause cancer in animals and other serious health effects. Now banned
from being manufactured, they were used in products like pigments,
paints and electrical equipment.</p>
<p>County public health officials said chemical tests of water samples
last month did not raise health concerns, so they downgraded one beach
closure to an ocean water advisory. Beachgoers were still advised to
stay out of the water.</p>
<p>Dinasquet and colleagues are working to understand how far
potentially toxic ash and debris dispersed across the ocean, how deep
and how fast they sunk and, over time, where it ends up.</p>
<p>Forest fires can deposit important nutrients like iron and nitrogen
into the ocean ecosystem, boosting the growth of phytoplankton, which
can create a positive, cascading effect across the ecosystem. But the
potentially toxic ash from urban coastal fires could have dire
consequences, Dinasquet said.</p>
<p>“Reports are already showing that there was a lot of lead and
asbestos in the ash,” she added. “This is really bad for people so it’s
probably also very bad for the marine organisms.”</p>

Presidents Day: How it evolved from reverence to retail</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Norfolk, Virginia — Like the other Founding Fathers, George
Washington was uneasy about the idea of publicly celebrating his life.
He was the first leader of a new republic, not a king.</p>
<p>And yet the United States will once again commemorate its first
president Monday, 293 years after he was born.</p>
<p>The meaning of Presidents Day has changed dramatically, from being
mostly unremarkable and filled with work for Washington in the 1700s to
the bonanza of consumerism it has become today. For some historians, the
holiday has lost all discernible meaning.</p>
<p>Historian Alexis Coe, author of “You Never Forget Your First: A
Biography of George Washington,” has said she thinks about Presidents
Day in much the same way as the towering monument in D.C. bearing his
name.</p>
<p>“It’s supposed to be about Washington, but can you really point to
anything that looks or sounds like him?” she remarked in an interview
with The Associated Press in 2024. “Jefferson and Lincoln are presented
as people with limbs and noses and words associated with their
memorials. And he’s just a giant, granite point. He has been sanded down
to have absolutely no identifiable features.”</p>
<p>Here is a look at how things have evolved:</p>
<p>Washington’s birthdays were celebrated, sometimes</p>
<p>Washington was born Feb. 22, 1732, on Popes Creek Plantation near the
Potomac River in Virginia.</p>
<p>Technically, though, he was born Feb. 11 under the ancient Julian
calendar, which was still in use for the first 20 years of his life. The
Gregorian calendar, intended to more accurately mark the solar year, was
adopted in 1752, adding 11 days.</p>
<p>Either way, Washington paid little attention to his birthday,
according to Mountvernon.org, the website of the organization that
manages his estate. Surviving records make no mention of observances at
Mount Vernon, while his diary shows he was often hard at work.</p>
<p>“If he had it his way, he would be at home with his family,” Coe
said. “Maybe some beloved nieces and nephews (and friend) Marquis de
Lafayette would be ideal. And Martha’s recipe for an indulgent cake. But
that’s about it.”</p>
<p>Washington’s birthday was celebrated by his peers in government when
he was president, mostly.</p>
<p>Congress voted during his first two terms to take a short
commemorative break each year, with one exception, his last birthday in
office, Coe said. By then, Washington was less popular, partisanship was
rampant, and many members of his original Cabinet were gone, including
Thomas Jefferson.</p>
<p>“One way to show their disdain for his Federalist policies was to
keep working through his birthday,” Coe said.</p>
<p>The Library of Congress does note a French military officer, the
Comte de Rochambeau, threw a ball celebrating Washington’s 50th birthday
in 1782.</p>
<p>After his death, a market for memorabilia is born</p>
<p>Washington was very aware of his inaugural role as president and its
distinction from the British crown. He didn’t want to be honored like a
king, Seth Bruggeman, a history professor at Temple University in
Philadelphia, told the AP last year.</p>
<p>Still, he said, a market for Washington memorabilia sprang up almost
immediately after his death in 1799 at age 67, with people snapping up
pottery and reproductions of etchings portraying him as a divine figure
going off into heaven.</p>
<p>“Even in that early moment, Americans kind of conflated consumerism
with patriotic memory,” said Bruggeman, whose books include “Here,
George Washington Was Born: Memory, Material Culture, and the Public
History of a National Monument.”</p>
<p>Making it official with parades and festivals</p>
<p>It wasn’t until 1832, the centennial of his birth, that Congress
established a committee to arrange national “parades, orations and
festivals,” according to the Congressional Research Service.</p>
<p>Only in 1879 was his birthday formally made into a legal holiday for
federal employees in the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>The official designation for the holiday is Washington’s Birthday,
although it has come to be known informally as Presidents Day. Arguments
have been made to honor President Lincoln as well because his birth date
falls nearby, on Feb. 12.</p>
<p>A small number of states, including Illinois, observe Lincoln’s
birthday as a public holiday, according to the Library of Congress. And
some commemorate both Lincoln and Washington on Presidents Day.</p>
<p>But on the federal level, the day is still officially Washington’s
Birthday.</p>
<p>A shift to consumerism</p>
<p>By the late 1960s, Washington’s Birthday was one of nine federal
holidays that fell on specific dates on different days of the week,
according to a 2004 article in the National Archives’ Prologue
magazine.</p>
<p>Congress voted to move some of those to Mondays, following concerns
that were in part about absenteeism among government workers when a
holiday fell midweek. But lawmakers also noted clear benefits to the
economy, including boosts in retail sales and travel on three-day
weekends.</p>
<p>The Uniform Monday Holiday Act took effect in 1971, moving Presidents
Day to the third Monday in February. Sales campaigns soared, historian
C. L. Arbelbide wrote in Prologue.</p>
<p>Bruggeman said Washington and the other Founding Fathers “would have
been deeply worried” by how the holiday became taken over by commercial
and private interests.</p>
<p>“They were very nervous about corporations,” Bruggeman said. “It
wasn’t that they forbade them. But they saw corporations as like little
republics that potentially threatened the power of The Republic.”</p>
<p>Coe, who is also a fellow at the Washington think tank New America,
said by now the day is devoid of recognizable traditions.</p>
<p>“There’s no moment of reflection,” Coe said. Given today’s widespread
cynicism toward the office, she added, that sort of reflection “would
probably be a good idea.”</p>

plays down immediate breakthrough on Russia-Ukraine peace</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Top U.S. officials headed Sunday to Saudi Arabia for talks with
Russian diplomats in the coming days on ending Moscow’s three-year war
on Ukraine, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio downplayed prospects for
an immediate breakthrough.</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin agreed
during an hour-long call last week to the immediate start of peace
negotiations, but Rubio told CBS’s “Face the Nation” in an interview
aired Sunday, “A process towards peace is not a one- meeting thing.”</p>
<p>“We’ll see in the coming days and weeks if Vladimir Putin is
interested in negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine in a way that is
sustainable and fair,” Rubio said.</p>
<p>Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and U.S. national security
adviser Mike Waltz said they were headed to Riyadh for the talks, while
a Ukrainian minister says that an official delegation has arrived there
in preparation for a possible visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy.</p>
<p>The shape of the talks remained uncertain.</p>
<p>Rubio said he wasn’t even sure who Moscow was sending. “Nothing’s
been finalized yet,” he said, adding that the hope was for an opening
for a broad conversation that “would include Ukraine and would involve
the end of the war.”</p>
<p>Trump’s call with Putin blindsided NATO allies as well as Kyiv, with
Zelenskyy later saying that there should be “no decisions about Ukraine
without Ukraine.”</p>
<p>Whatever occurs this week in Saudi Arabia, Rubio said that once “real
negotiations” begin, then Ukraine “will have to be involved.”</p>
<p>Hours before European leaders meet in Paris to address Washington’s
policy shift on the war in Ukraine, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer
wrote in the Daily Telegraph on Sunday that he was ready to send British
troops to Ukraine as part of any postwar peacekeeping force.</p>
<p>“I do not say that lightly,” he wrote. “I feel very deeply the
responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen
and women in harm’s way.”</p>
<p>Starmer said securing a lasting peace in Ukraine was essential to
deter Russian President Putin from further aggression.</p>
<p>His article was meant to show the U.S. that European nations should
have a role in discussions on ending the nearly 3-year-old conflict.</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron also warned that European countries
should do more for their collective security, as talks between the
United States and Russia loom.</p>
<p>The U.K. premier is due to join leaders from Germany, Italy, Poland,
Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark at the Paris meeting on Monday, just
days ahead of the anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on
Feb. 24, 2022.</p>
<p>In an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press” that aired Sunday,
Ukrainian President Zelenskyy said, “I will never accept any decisions
between the United States and Russia about Ukraine. Never. The war in
Ukraine is against us, and it is our human losses.”</p>
<p>Zelenskyy said he told Trump in a call they had last week that Putin
is only pretending to want peace.</p>
<p>“I said that he is a liar. And [Trump] said, ‘I think my feeling is
that he’s ready for these negotiations.’ And I said to him, ‘No, he’s a
liar. He doesn’t want any peace.’”</p>
<p>The United States has been Ukraine’s biggest arms supplier during the
conflict, but Trump has wavered on continued support and declined during
a political debate last year to say that he wants Ukraine to win.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy said that without continued U.S. military support,
“Probably it will be very, very, very difficult” to defeat Russia. “And
of course, in all the difficult situations, you have a chance. But we
will have low chance – low chance to survive without support of the
United States.”</p>
<p>Russia now controls about 20% of Ukraine’s internationally recognized
territory, including the Crimean Peninsula it unilaterally annexed in
2014 and the eastern portion of Ukraine pro-Moscow separatists captured
after that and since the full-scale February 2022 Russian invasion.</p>

id="captain-america-brave-new-world-soars-toward-100-million-holiday-weekend">‘Captain
America: Brave New World’ soars toward $100 million holiday weekend</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>“Captain America: Brave New World” infused some blockbuster cash into
the North American box office, bringing in $88.5 million in ticket sales
over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. The Walt Disney
Co. release is by far the biggest opener of 2025 and the company
predicts it will hit $100 million domestically and $192.4 globally by
the end of Monday’s Presidents’ Day holiday.</p>
<p>It’s Marvel’s first major release since “Deadpool &amp; Wolverine”
broke records last summer and re-energized a Marvel fanbase that some
worried was weakening after the poor showing for “The Marvels.”</p>
<p>Playing in 4,105 locations in the U.S. and Canada, “Brave New World”
is also a major transition for the “Captain America” brand: Anointing
Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson as the new Cap, officially taking over from
Chris Evans, who played the character for almost a decade. Harrison Ford
co-stars as the U.S. president who transforms into the Red Hulk.</p>
<p>But “Brave New World,” directed by Julius Onah, had a bit of a
handicap going into the weekend: Poor reviews, though superhero movies
can soar without the stamp of approval from critics. The film is
currently sitting at 51% “rotten” on Rotten Tomatoes. It’s not the worst
in the Marvel Cinematic Universe — “Eternals” has a 47% rating and
“Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania” has a 46% — but the latest film is
on the very low end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>In his review for The Associated Press, Mark Kennedy wrote that it
is, “a highly processed, empty calorie, regret-later candy of a
movie.”</p>
<p>Audiences were more generous in their opinions. The “verified
audience score” from Rotten Tomatoes was 80% and its CinemaScore was a
B-. Exit polls showed that men made up 63% of the opening weekend
audience.</p>
<p>The bar for biggest opening of the year wasn’t terribly high: “Dog
Man” held the title for two weeks with its $36 million launch.</p>
<p>And “Brave New World’s” showing is the middle range for an MCU film.
Not accounting for inflation, it sits between “Guardians of the Galaxy”
and “Thor: The Dark World.”</p>
<p>It also cost significantly less than many of the big budget Marvel
movies, with a reported production price tag of $180 million, excluding
the millions spent on marketing and promotion.</p>
<p>After only one Marvel movie in 2024, “Brave New World” is the first
of three major theatrical releases set for 2025. It is to be followed by
“Thunderbolts(asterisk)” in May and “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” in
July.</p>
<p>“The superhero genre has taken a hit over the past few years, but
audiences still have a huge interest in seeing them on the big screen,”
said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore.</p>
<p>Second place at this week’s box office went to “Paddington in Peru,”
the third installment in the beloved franchise, which finally opened in
North America this weekend. Released by Sony, it earned an estimated $13
million and should hit $16 million by Monday. The StudioCanal film
opened in the United Kingdom in early November 2024 and went into the
weekend with $104 million from its international run.</p>
<p>Dougal Wilson took over directing duties for Paul King for this film,
which also recast Emily Mortimer as Mrs. Brown, originally played by
Sally Hawkins. The other main cast, including Ben Whishaw as Paddinton’s
voice, remained intact.</p>
<p>Sony and Screen Gems’ slasher “Heart Eyes” landed in third place with
$10 million, up 20% from its opening last weekend. Fourth place went to
“Dog Man” with $9.7 million.</p>
<p>The Chinese blockbuster “Ne Zha 2” rounded out the top five. It
opened on 660 screens in North America and made $7.2 million. Overall,
the box office is up 20% from last year.</p>
<p>This weekend also saw the release of a new “Bridget Jones” movie,
subtitled “Mad About the Boy,” which went straight to Universal’s
streaming service Peacock, forgoing theaters in the U.S. In the U.K. and
Ireland, it made an estimated $14.9 million, outgrossing “Captain
America: Brave New World.” Universal Pictures International reported
$32.3 million in grosses from all 70 territories.</p>
<p>The final domestic figures will be released Tuesday. Estimated ticket
sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according
to Comscore:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>“Captain America: Brave New World,” $88.5 million.</p></li>

<h2 id="us-border-czar-unhappy-with-pace-of-migrant-arrests">US ‘border
czar’ unhappy with pace of migrant arrests</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump’s “border czar” said Sunday he is “not
happy” with the number of undocumented migrants being arrested by
immigration agents and deported to their home countries. </p>
<p>Tom Homan told CNN’s “State of the Union” show that 14,000 migrants
had been arrested since Trump was inaugurated January 20, but said,
“We’ve got to do a lot more.” </p>
<p>Many of those arrested have been flown back to their native lands or
sent to the prison on the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba,
while some have been released to live in the United States pending court
proceedings. </p>
<p>The U.S. estimates that 11 million undocumented migrants are living
in the U.S., with Trump pledging during his 2024 run for the presidency
to find and deport “millions” of them. Officials say that the first
arrests have targeted migrants convicted of crimes in the U.S. but that
anyone living in the country without proper immigration documentation
could be targeted. </p>
<p>Homan said the number being deported is “a lot higher” than under the
former administration of President Joe Biden, but added, “We’ve got to
get the targeting and production up. It’s hard work.” </p>
<p>The Trump administration has tapped law enforcement personnel from
several U.S. agencies to augment those at the U.S. Immigration and
Customs Enforcement agency, which normally controls migration
issues. </p>
<p>In the first days of the Trump administration, there were hundreds of
migrant arrests daily and there still are, but just not as many. </p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security reported about 800 arrests a day
in late January, topping out at 1,179 on Jan. 26. The figure was fewer
than 600 a day in the first two weeks of February. </p>
<p>The Trump administration had set a goal of 1,200 to 1,500 arrests a
day.</p>

<p>Editor’s note: Here is a look at immigration-related news around the
U.S. this week. Questions? Tips? Comments? Email the VOA immigration
team: ImmigrationUnit@voanews.com.</p>
<p>Trump administration moves quickly with mass deportation plans</p>
<p>Since taking office, U.S. President Donald Trump has declared illegal
immigration a national emergency. The Trump administration ramped up its
mass deportation efforts, expanding the use of expedited removal and
using Guantanamo Bay as a detention site for certain migrants. The moves
have raised concerns among immigration advocates, who argue that the
policies lack transparency and could violate due process rights. VOA’s
immigration reporter, Aline Barros, reports.</p>
<p>US fires 20 immigration judges from backlogged courts</p>
<p>The administration of President Donald Trump has fired 20 immigration
judges without explanation, a union official said Saturday amid sweeping
moves to shrink the size of the federal government. On Friday, 13 judges
who had yet to be sworn in and five assistant chief immigration judges
were dismissed without notice, said Matthew Biggs, president of the
International Federation of Professional &amp; Technical Engineers,
which represents federal workers. Two other judges were fired under
similar circumstances last week. The Associated Press reports.</p>
<p>With doors closed to US, asylum-seekers turn to a new life in
Mexico</p>
<p>When Angelica Delgado took a one-way flight to Mexico as she fled
Cuba in December, she was set on seeking asylum in the United States.
But after President Donald Trump effectively slammed the door on
asylum-seekers crossing the U.S. border when he took office last month,
the 23-year-old recalibrated her plans. She decided she would seek
protection in Mexico. The Associated Press reports.</p>
<p>US deports 119 migrants from several nations to Panama</p>
<p>Panama has received the first U.S. flight carrying deportees from
other nations as the administration of President Donald Trump takes
Panama up on its offer to act as a stopover for expelled migrants, the
Central American nation’s president said Thursday. “Yesterday, a flight
from the United States Air Force arrived with 119 people from diverse
nationalities of the world,” President Jose Raul Mulino said Thursday in
his weekly news briefing. He said migrants from China, Uzbekistan,
Pakistan, Afghanistan, and other countries were on board. The Associated
Press reports.</p>
<p>Chicago nonprofit helps undocumented migrants afraid to leave
home</p>
<p>Amid nationwide immigration raids, a community organization in
Chicago is helping undocumented migrants who say they are afraid to
leave their homes for fear of being detained. Veronica Villafane
narrates this report by Enrique Garcia Fuentes.</p>
<p>Arrests for illegal border crossings fall in Texas</p>
<p>An idled Border Patrol bus sat empty this past week, on standby for
any migrants surrendering near the southern tip of Texas. Agents in two
speedboats zipped by pockets of sandy shores, known landing spots for
people entering the U.S. illegally from Mexico on inner tubes, but saw
nothing suspicious. Once-busy river landings near the Texas border city
of Mission were barren of the migrants who previously crossed there,
although the riverbank was littered with clothes, plastic bracelets
issued by smugglers and a teddy bear on an unusually cold Thursday
morning. The Associated Press reports.</p>
<p>New York City mayor to allow ICE agents at Rikers jail</p>
<p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams says he will allow federal immigration
officials to operate at the city’s Rikers Island jail following a
meeting Thursday with President Donald Trump’s border czar. Adams said
he will issue an executive order reestablishing the U.S. Immigration and
Customs Enforcement presence at the complex — one of the nation’s
largest and most notorious lockups — as had been the case under prior
administrations. The Associated Press reports.</p>
<p>VOA60 Africa - Nigeria: Thousands of refugees return from Chad</p>
<p>Thousands of Nigerians who fled to Chad to escape jihadi violence in
Nigeria’s northeast have returned after more than a decade. Around 3,600
refugees arrived in Maiduguri, the regional capital of Borno State,
aboard trucks.</p>
<p>Immigration around the world</p>
<p>Guam a doorway to US for Chinese asylum-seekers</p>
<p>President Donald Trump’s immigration policy has mainly been focused
on migrants trying to cross into the U.S. at its border with Mexico,
some having made the perilous trek from as far as South America. Out in
the western Pacific Ocean, some Chinese are taking an equally dangerous
route to the U.S. VOA’s Yu Yao and Jiu Dao have their story, narrated by
Elizabeth Lee.</p>
<p>VOA Creole: Congressman asks Trump to renew TPS for Haitians</p>
<p>Republican Congressman Mike Lawler of New York told VOA in an
exclusive interview that he will ask President Donald Trump to renew
Temporary Protected Status for Haitians. TPS will expire for current
holders in February 2026. Lawler told VOA that gang violence, drug and

<h2 id="rubio-hamas-must-be-eradicated">Rubio: Hamas ‘must be
eradicated’</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. fully endorsed Israel’s war aims in Gaza on Sunday, with
Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying that Hamas “must be eradicated”
and “cannot continue as a military or government force.”</p>
<p>Rubio met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem
at the start of a regional tour as the first phase of a tenuous
Israel-Hamas ceasefire expires in two weeks, with the second segment yet
to be negotiated.</p>
<p>Rubio, on his first trip to the Middle East as the new top U.S.
diplomat, told Netanyahu that “as long as [Hamas] stands as a force that
can govern or as a force that can administer or as a force that can
threaten by use of violence, peace becomes impossible.”</p>
<p>Rubio is likely to face continued opposition from Arab nations about
U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to move Palestinians out of Gaza into
neighboring countries and then for Israel to hand over the narrow
territory along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea to the U.S. to own
and redevelop.</p>
<p>While U.S. allies and adversaries alike have assailed Trump’s Gaza
plan, Netanyahu has welcomed it, saying that he and Trump have a “common
strategy” for Gaza’s future.</p>
<p>Echoing Trump, the Israeli leader said “the gates of hell would be
open” if Hamas does not release dozens of remaining hostages abducted in
its Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war.</p>
<p>Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, freed three hostages
Saturday in exchange for nearly 400 Palestinians who had been jailed in
Israel. But the militants continue to hold dozens of hostages they
captured in the terror attack that killed 1,200 people.</p>
<p>Israel’s counteroffensive during 15 months of fighting in Gaza has
killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to the territory’s
health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and
civilians. Israel, without proving evidence, says it has killed over
17,000 militants.</p>
<p>Rubio and Netanyahu met as the first phase of the ceasefire nears its
end. In the second phase, the tentative plan calls for Hamas to release
dozens of remaining hostages in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners,
drafting of a permanent truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. But
the detailed terms of the deal have yet to be negotiated.</p>
<p>The tough U.S. stance aligning with Netanyahu’s position could
complicate efforts to continue talks with Hamas, which, despite
suffering heavy losses in the war, remains intact and in control of
Gaza.</p>
<p>Some of Netanyahu’s supporters in the Israeli government want to
continue the war when the first phase of the ceasefire ends but resuming
it could endanger the lives of the remaining hostages.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has offered Hamas a chance to surrender and send its top
leaders into exile, but Hamas has rejected such a scenario.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, despite the ceasefire largely holding, the Israeli
military said it carried out an airstrike early Sunday on people who
approached its forces in southern Gaza.</p>
<p>The Hamas-run Interior Ministry said the strike killed three of its
policemen while they were securing the entry of aid trucks near Rafah,
on the Egyptian border.</p>
<p>Hamas described the attack as a “serious violation” of the ceasefire
and accused Netanyahu of trying to sabotage the deal.</p>
<p>During his tour of the region, Rubio was not scheduled to meet with
any Palestinian officials.</p>
<p>Egypt says it is hosting an Arab summit on Feb. 27, and is working
with other countries on a counterproposal that would allow for Gaza to
be rebuilt without removing its population. Human rights groups say the
expulsion of Palestinians would likely violate international law.</p>
<p>Arab nations have long called for creation of an independent
Palestinian state to exist alongside Israel, which the U.S. has also
supported. But Netanyahu opposes a two-state solution and U.S. ownership
of Gaza also would likely end the possibility of a Palestinian state
encompassing Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.</p>
<p>Egypt has warned that any mass influx of Palestinians from Gaza would
undermine its nearly half-century-old peace treaty with Israel, a
cornerstone of American influence in the region.</p>
<p>Rubio is also set to visit the United Arab Emirates and Saudi
Arabia.</p>
<p>The United Arab Emirates was the leading force behind the 2020
Abraham Accords in which four Arab states normalized relations with
Israel during Trump’s first White House term. Trump hopes to expand the
accords to include Saudi Arabia, potentially offering closer U.S.
defense ties, but the kingdom has said it will not normalize relations
with Israel without a pathway to a Palestinian state.</p>

<h2 id="dead-including-8-in-kentucky-in-latest-winter-weather-blast">9
dead, including 8 in Kentucky, in latest winter weather blast</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOUISVILLE, Ky. — At least nine people have died in the most recent
round of harsh weather to pummel the U.S., including eight people in
Kentucky who died as creeks swelled from heavy rain and water covered
roads. </p>
<p>Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Sunday that hundreds of people
stranded by flooding had to be rescued. </p>
<p>Beshear said many of the deaths, including a mother and 7-year-old
child, were caused by cars getting stuck in high water. </p>
<p>“So folks, stay off the roads right now and stay alive,” he said.
“This is the search and rescue phase, and I am very proud of all the
Kentuckians that are out there responding, putting their lives on the
line.” </p>
<p>Beshear said the storms have knocked out power to about 39,000 homes,
but he warned that harsh winds in some areas could increase
outages. </p>
<p>Much of the U.S. beyond Kentucky faced another round of biting winter
weather. The Northern Plains faced life-threatening cold, and tornado
watches were issued for parts of Georgia and Florida. </p>
<p>Hart County Coroner Tony Roberts said earlier that the mother and
child were swept away Saturday night in the Bonnieville community. In
southeastern Kentucky, a 73-year-old man was found dead in floodwaters
in Clay County, County Emergency Management Deputy Director Revelle
Berry said. </p>
<p>Parts of Kentucky and Tennessee received up to 6 inches 15
centimeters (6 inches) of rain during the weekend storms, said Bob
Oravec, a senior forecaster with the National Weather Service. </p>
<p>“The effects will continue for a while, a lot of swollen streams and
a lot of flooding going on,” Oravec said Sunday. “Any time there’s
flooding, the flooding can last a lot longer than the rain lasts.” </p>
<p>In Atlanta, a person was killed when an “extremely large tree” fell
on a home early Sunday, according to Atlanta Fire Rescue Capt. Scott
Powell. He told reporters that firefighters were dispatched just before
5 a.m. after a 911 call. </p>
<p>Elsewhere, bone-chilling cold is expected for the Northern Plains
with low temperatures into the minus 30s Celsius (minus 30s Fahrenheit)
near the Canadian border. Dangerously cold wind chill temperatures in
the Dakotas and Minnesota of minus 40 Celsius (minus 40 Fahrenheit)
to minus 45.6 Celsius (minus 50 Fahrenheit) are expected. </p>
<p>Heavy snowfall amounts were expected in parts of New England and
northern New York. In some areas, wind gusts could reach about 97 kph
(60 mph) and create “hazardous whiteout conditions,” the NWS said. </p>
<p>Kentucky faces severe flooding </p>
<p>Water submerged cars and buildings in Kentucky and mudslides blocked
roads in Virginia late Saturday into Sunday. Both of the states were
under flood warnings, along with Tennessee and Arkansas. The National
Weather Service warned residents to stay off the roads. </p>
<p>Chilly temperatures replaced the heavy rains with snow early Sunday
in parts of Kentucky. </p>
<p>The Kentucky River Medical Center in the city of Jackson said closed
its emergency department and was transferring all patients to two other
hospitals in the region. The hospital said it would re-evaluate
conditions Sunday morning to determine when it can safely reopen. The
north fork of the Kentucky River was forecast to crest nearly 4.3 meters
(14 feet) above flood stage that afternoon, the weather service
said. </p>
<p>Photos posted by authorities and residents on social media showed
cars and buildings underwater in south-central and eastern Kentucky. In
Buchanan County, Virginia, the sheriff’s office said multiple roads were
blocked by mudslides. </p>
<p>The Simpson County Office of Emergency Management in Kentucky said
authorities performed several rescues from stalled-out vehicles in
floodwaters. </p>
<p>“Stay home if you can,” the office said on Facebook. </p>
<p>New England faces snow, then sleet </p>
<p>Meanwhile heavy snow was expected to blanket much of New England and
then transition to sleet. </p>
<p>Oravec said Sunday that snowfall in the region was relatively light,
due to the freezing rain and sleet mix. </p>
<p>Snow and arctic temperatures swept much of the Midwest and Upper
Plains on Saturday, covering roads in eastern Nebraska, northern Iowa
and much of Wisconsin. Winter weather advisories were issued for parts
of those states and Michigan, with up to 10.6 centimeters (4 inches) of
snow predicted throughout Iowa, southern Wisconsin and most of Michigan
by Sunday evening. </p>
<p>Frigid polar vortex </p>
<p>Meteorologists said the U.S. was about to get its 10th and coldest
polar vortex stretching event this season, with the northern Rockies and
northern Plains first in line. Weather forces in the Arctic are
combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole
into the U.S. and Europe. </p>
<p>In Denver, where temperatures were expected to dip as low as minus 10
degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit) over the weekend, the city
opened shelters for those living on the streets.</p>

id="white-south-africans-gather-in-support-of-trump-his-claims-they-are-victims-of-racism">White
South Africans gather in support of Trump, his claims they are victims
of racism</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA — Some white South Africans showed support for
President Donald Trump on Saturday and gathered at the U.S. Embassy in
Pretoria to claim they are victims of racism by their own
government.</p>
<p>Hundreds of protesters held placards that read “Thank God for
President Trump” and displayed other messages criticizing what they see
as racist laws instituted by the South African government that
discriminate against the white minority.</p>
<p>Many were from the Afrikaner community that Trump focused on in an
executive order a week ago that cut aid and assistance to the Black-led
South African government. In the order, Trump said South Africa’s
Afrikaners, who are descendants of mainly Dutch colonial settlers, were
being targeted by a new law that allows the government to expropriate
private land. </p>
<p>The South African government has denied its new law is tied to race
and says Trump’s claims over the country and the law have been full of
misinformation and distortions. </p>
<p>Trump said land was being expropriated from Afrikaners — which the
order referred to as “racially disfavored landowners” — when no land has
been taken under the law. Trump also announced a plan to offer
Afrikaners refugee status in the U.S. They are only one part of South
Africa’s white minority. </p>
<p>In a speech to Parliament this week, South African President Cyril
Ramaphosa said the forced removal of any people from their land will
never be allowed in South Africa again after millions of Blacks were
dispossessed of property under the apartheid system of white minority
rule and hundreds of years of colonialism before that. </p>
<p>“The people of this country know the pain of forced removals,”
Ramaphosa said. He said the land law does not allow any arbitrary taking
of land and only refers to land that can be redistributed for the public
good. </p>
<p>The Trump administration’s criticism and punishment of South Africa
has elevated a long-standing dilemma in the country over moves to
address the wrongs of centuries of white minority rule that oppressed
the Black majority. </p>
<p>According to the government, the land law aims to fairly address the
inequality that the majority of farmland in South Africa is owned by
whites, even though they make up just 7% of the country’s
population. </p>
<p>White protesters on Saturday held banners referencing the
expropriation law but also other affirmative action policies put in
place by the government since the end of apartheid in 1994 to advance
opportunities for Blacks. Those laws, known as Black Economic
Empowerment, have been a source of frustration for some white
people.</p>
<p>Influential Trump adviser Elon Musk — who was raised in South Africa
— has also criticized South Africa’s government and claimed it is
anti-white for years, although some have questioned his motivations. He
has recently failed to get a license for his Starlink satellite internet
service in South Africa because it doesn’t meet the country’s
affirmative action criteria.</p>
<p>While race has long framed South African politics, the country has
been largely successful in reconciling its racially diverse people in
the years after apartheid. The current government is made up of a
coalition of 10 Black-led and white-led political parties that are
working together.</p>

id="breakfast-is-booming-at-us-restaurants.-is-it-also-contributing-to-high-egg-prices">Breakfast
is booming at US restaurants. Is it also contributing to high egg
prices?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>It’s a chicken-and-egg problem: Restaurants are struggling with
record-high U.S. egg prices, but their omelets, scrambles and huevos
rancheros may be part of the problem.</p>
<p>Breakfast is booming at U.S. eateries. First Watch, a restaurant
chain that serves breakfast, brunch and lunch, nearly quadrupled its
locations over the past decade to 570. Eggs Up Grill has 90 restaurants
in nine southern states, up from 26 in 2018. Florida-based Another
Broken Egg Café celebrated its 100th restaurant last year.</p>
<p>Fast-food chains are also adding more breakfast items. Starbucks,
which launched egg bites in 2017, now has a breakfast menu with 12
separate items containing eggs. Wendy’s reintroduced breakfast in 2020
and offers 10 items with eggs.</p>
<p>Reviews website Yelp said 6,421 breakfast and brunch businesses
opened in the United States last year, 23% more than in 2019.</p>
<p>In normal times, producers could meet the demand for all those eggs.
But an ongoing bird flu outbreak, which so far has forced farms to
slaughter nearly 159 million chickens, turkeys and other birds —
including nearly 47 million since the start of December — is making
supplies scarcer and pushing up prices. In January, the average price of
eggs in the U.S. hit a record $4.95 per dozen.</p>
<p>The percentage of eggs that go to U.S. restaurants versus other
places, like grocery stores or food manufacturers, is not publicly
available. U.S. Foods, a restaurant supplier, and Cal-Maine Foods, the
largest U.S. producer of shell eggs, did not respond to The Associated
Press’ requests for comment.</p>
<p>But demand from restaurants is almost certainly growing. Foot traffic
at U.S. restaurants has grown the most since 2019 for morning meals,
2019, according to market research firm Circana. Pre-lunchtime hours
accounted for 21% of total restaurant visits in 2024.</p>
<p>Breakfast sandwiches are the most popular order during morning
visits, Circana said, and 70% of the breakfast sandwiches on U.S. menus
include eggs.</p>
<p>Eggs Up Grill CEO Ricky Richardson said breakfast restaurants took
off after the COVID pandemic because people longed for comfort and
connection. As inflation made food more expensive, customers saw
breakfast and lunch as more affordable options for eating out, he
said.</p>
<p>The growth in restaurant demand reverses a pattern that emerged
during the pandemic, when consumers tried to stock up on eggs for home
use but restaurants needed fewer of them because many of them had to
close for a time, according to Brian Earnest, a lead economist for
animal proteins at CoBank.</p>
<p>U.S. egg consumption declined for more than five decades before
reaching a low of 247 per person in 2008, according to data from the
U.S. Department of Agriculture. As nutritional research and marketing
established eggs as an inexpensive protein source instead of
heart-clogging cholesterol bombs, per capita consumption of egg products
grew to the equivalent of 292 fresh eggs in 2019, the data shows.</p>
<p>“Consumers think eggs are really fresh, so if you’re making something
with eggs, you know it’s fresh,” Earnest said.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic reduced demand and bird flu outbreaks impacted
supplies, the USDA had forecast that Americans would continue eating
more eggs. By 2023, the most recent year for which annual data is
available, they were down to 249 eggs per person.</p>
<p>Other trends have impacted the economics of eggs. To address animal
rights concerns, McDonald’s and some other companies have switched to
100% cage-free eggs, which limits the sources they will buy from. Ten
states, including California and Colorado, have passed laws restricting
egg sales to products from cage-free environments.</p>
<p>“It makes the market much more complicated than it was 20 years ago,”
Earnest said.</p>
<p>The higher prices are hitting restaurants hard. Wholesale egg prices
hit a national average of $7.34 per dozen last week, according to the
U.S. Department of Agriculture. That was 51% higher than at the
beginning of the year. Wholesale costs may be higher than retail prices
since grocers use eggs as a loss leader to get customers in the
door.</p>
<p>Some chains, like Waffle House, have added a surcharge to help offset
the cost of eggs. Others may turn to egg substitutes like tapioca starch
for some recipes or cut egg dishes from the menu, said Phil Kafarakis,
the president and CEO of the International Foodservice Manufacturers
Association.</p>
<p>First Watch President and CEO Chris Tomasso said eggs are critical
for the chain’s brand and are found in the majority of its offerings,
whether at the center of the plate or as an ingredient in batters. So
far, he said, the company has been able to obtain the eggs it needs and
isn’t charging extra for them.</p>
<p>First Watch is also increasing portion sizes for non-egg items like
meat and potatoes, Tomasso said.</p>
<p>Richardson, of Eggs Up Grill, said he recently met with franchisees
to discuss adding a surcharge but they decided against it.</p>
<p>“Eggs have always been and will continue to be an important part of
American diets,” Richardson said.</p>

id="us-man-sues-travel-company-after-hippo-kills-wife-on-zambia-trip">US
man sues travel company after hippo kills wife on Zambia trip</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A New Jersey man whose wife was killed in a horrific hippopotamus
attack last year during a safari in Africa is suing the U.S. company
that arranged the trip, alleging it failed to ensure their safety and
did not adequately screen and supervise the tour guides.</p>
<p>Craig and Lisa Manders were on a guided walk in Zambia in June when a
hippo charged out of the water, grabbed Lisa Manders by its mouth and
crushed her head and body with its bite, according to the lawsuit filed
against African Portfolio, a safari tour company based in Greenwich,
Connecticut. The company denies the lawsuit’s allegations.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed Feb. 5 in Stamford, Connecticut, alleges that as a
horrified Craig Manders watched the attack, the tour guides — including
at least one armed with a rifle — walked away without helping the
couple. Lisa Manders, 70, suffered catastrophic injuries and died
shortly after, the lawsuit says.</p>
<p>“We’re doing this because this should never have happened,” said Paul
Slager, an attorney who is representing Craig Manders with his law
partner, Nicole Coates. “There are basic safety standards that
businesses are expected to follow, and that includes people in the
safari tour industry. And those were not followed, and the consequences
here were absolutely devastating.”</p>
<p>Slager said the lawsuit seeks monetary damages that have not yet been
determined, as well as accountability for Lisa Manders’ death and
keeping others safe in the future. He said Craig Manders was not giving
interviews.</p>
<p>The Manderses, of Cranford, New Jersey, were on a special anniversary
trip and it was their first time in Africa, Slager said. Lisa Manders
had worked in the financial industry for over 40 years and loved
cooking, traveling and visiting New York City, where she was born in
Queens in 1953, according to her obituary. The couple had three children
and a granddaughter.</p>
<p>The company’s lawyer, Rodney Gould, said it was not negligent or
reckless in connection with Lisa Manders’ death. He said African
Portfolio only arranged the couple’s lodging and the owners of the
lodging, Chiawa Safaris in Zambia, provided the tour guides.</p>
<p>“It’s a horrible tragedy when somebody goes on one of these trips and
is injured or killed. It’s awful,” Gould said. “I think it’s important
to understand what African Portfolio’s role in this is. It’s a tour
operator. It arranges trips. It puts together the pieces.”</p>
<p>He added, “My client didn’t conduct the safari. It arranged it. It
booked all the components.”</p>
<p>Gould also said the company was not negligent in vetting Chiawa,
because it has an excellent reputation. He said African Portfolio will
either ask a judge to dismiss the lawsuit or request that the matter go
to arbitration, which was a condition of an agreement the Manderses
signed for the trip.</p>
<p>In a statement, African Portfolio did not directly address the
lawsuit. It said Chiawa arranged the walking safari and guests were
accompanied by an experienced and highly trained guide, a ranger and an
armed National Park scout. It said Chiawa told authorities that safety
measures were implemented before the attack and “repeated warnings” were
issued to guests to return to the safety of the vehicle “during the
incident.”</p>
<p>Asked whether the guests were warned about the hippo before the
attack, African Portfolio said in an email only that “the statement is
an accurate reflection of the events as we understand them.” Gould
declined to comment.</p>
<p>The company also said its founder flew to Zambia immediately after
the attack and joined Chiawa’s owner in ensuring that “everything
possible was being done to support the family and all those involved.
Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the family, and everyone
else involved in this tragic incident.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit, which does not mention Chiawa, says African safaris are
“inherently dangerous activities” because of the unpredictability and
sometime aggressive nature of wild animals, and they require careful
planning and execution to be completed safely. It says African Portfolio
vetted and oversaw the tour guides and vouched that they were competent,
qualified and trained to keep people safe.</p>
<p>The suit alleges that African Portfolio “encouraged and/or permitted”
the Manderses to be exposed to an “avoidable and highly dangerous
encounter with a dangerous hippopotamus in the Zambian wilderness.” It
also accuses the company of failing to provide safe conditions during
the wilderness walk and failing to ensure that the tour guides were
adequately selected, screened, supervised and trained to provide a safe
experience.</p>
<p>African Portfolio also failed to take adequate steps to protect the
Manderses before and during the attack, the suit alleges.</p>
<p>Hippos are the world’s second-largest land mammals after elephants,
measuring about 3.5 meters long and about 1.5 meters tall, according to
International Fund for Animal Welfare. The average male hippo weighs
about 3,200 kilograms.</p>
<p>Hippos are known to be territorial and aggressive at times. A year
before Lisa Manders died, seven people were killed in the southern
African nation of Malawi when a hippo charged into a canoe and capsized
it on a river. Estimates of how many people are killed by hippos each
year vary, with lower figures beginning at around 500.</p>
<p>Lisa Manders suffered “significant premorbid fear and emotional pain,
suffering and mental anguish” before her death, the suit says. Craig
Manders suffered severe and debilitating emotional and psychological
injuries that have made it difficult for him to cope with daily
routines, it says.</p>
<p>The lawsuit is seeking damages on allegations of negligence and
recklessness.</p>
<p>“He’s suing both for the loss of his wife and the impact that has on
him and his life,” Slager said. “And he also has a claim for having
witnessed what happened to her, having seen the attack, which is
unthinkable. It’s unimaginable.”</p>

lost in US disasters find way home with help from people who care</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Hollowed-out homes. Cars entombed by mud. Unpeopled
roads. Belongings reduced to dirt and debris. </p>
<p>It all took a toll on Taylor Schenker. </p>
<p>After Hurricane Helene last September, Schenker was upset by the
deluge of images of Asheville, North Carolina. “This storm has taken so
much,” she said, “and it’s so jarring to see the photos of the horrible
devastation.”</p>
<p>So less than a week after the storm, she set out to do something
about the wide-scale loss. </p>
<p>While helping a friend search for belongings cast downriver, she
stumbled on a handful of photos of strangers — mud-caked, curled up in
tree branches and stuck under river rocks. The images captured family
reunions, newborn babies, weddings, birthday parties, beloved pets and
school portraits. </p>
<p>“These tiny photos had been through so much and miraculously had
washed up and were in decent enough condition that you could see what
they were,” said Schenker, 27. “It stuck with me.” </p>
<p>To reclaim the search phrase “photos from Helene,” she created an
Instagram for “something positive, which is reuniting people with their
memories.” She set up a post-office box, linked up with a volunteer
search and rescue crew, and ultimately uncovered more than 500 photos —
or what she calls “little needles in a haystack.” </p>
<p>When Schenker made her first match, she got chills. </p>
<p>Then, sitting in her car, she cried. </p>
<p>Photos found amid muck </p>
<p>We hold onto photos to keep memories alive — of people, places and
moments that might otherwise fade. Or sometimes are ripped away
abruptly. </p>
<p>Schenker has since returned more than 70 such images. A stack of them
were hand-delivered to Mary Moss, whose car was destroyed by an uprooted
tree as she and her husband evacuated the Asheville home where they had
lived for almost 40 years. </p>
<p>“It was really kind of overwhelming at first when she handed me those
pictures. I just couldn’t even speak,” Moss said. “You don’t expect
something as fragile as photos to be retrieved.” </p>
<p>Months later, they’ve received some FEMA assistance and found a
temporary home, which they’re gradually furnishing with church
donations. But some things are irreplaceable. </p>
<p>“This is not really about losing the home and all the material stuff
in there. But what’s been devastating is that that was everything we had
of Tommy,” she said of their son who died at age 12 from a genetic
disorder. “It’s those memories and the little things, the photos, that
you can’t replace.” </p>
<p>As Schenker later understood it, “When they lost their home, they
lost virtually all proof that this child existed.” </p>
<p>“It is such a privilege to look into the intimate moments of people’s
lives,” she said. “They’ve literally lost everything and they can’t ever
recreate those childhood photos.” </p>
<p>In photos Schenker found nearly 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the Moss
family home, Tommy is seen as a 2-year-old dressed like an angel for a
Christmas pageant. In another, he is wearing a toddler-sized suit; in
yet another, he’s playing at daycare alongside his younger brother
Dallas. </p>
<p>“It is just breathtaking,” Moss said. “This is one thing that the
river didn’t get to take — or didn’t get to keep.” </p>
<p>Smoke, water, ash, soot</p>
<p>More than 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) away, in the Altadena
foothills of Los Angeles, Claire Schwartz, 31, began to collect photos
with a similar idea: Find images, post them online, try to unite them
with their owners. </p>
<p>After the Eaton fire, but before the first rain, she panicked. When
rain and ash mix, it makes lye, which destroys photos. “Someone has to
do this ASAP,” she remembers thinking to herself. “And I realized it had
to be me — because nobody else was doing it.” </p>
<p>Luca Ackerman, a New York-based photo conservator, cautions that mold
can start to develop 48 hours after water exposure. To slow the
deterioration process, he freezes such prints — and advised to not wipe
off any surfaces, which can drag toxic oils across the print, “driving
particles deeper into the material.” Some photos are so brittle, too,
that when touched they may disintegrate. </p>
<p>In the wake of disasters, conservators like Ackerman are deployed in
volunteer rotations with the National Heritage Responders. Rapidly, he
trains art handlers and museum staff how to treat sensitive materials,
whether they are damaged by smoke, water, ash or soot. </p>
<p>Wearing a respirator, nitrile gloves and booties, Schwartz swiftly
set out to salvage photos — finding them alongside pages from yearbooks,
sheet music, and children’s art in nearby parks, neighbors’ front yards
and a golf course. </p>
<p>“The wind has scattered everything, everywhere. And trash is mixed in
with precious mementos everywhere you look,” she said. “It’s just
absolutely bizarre how stuff clumps together and travels as a
unit.” </p>
<p>Finding the photographed people</p>
<p>Normally, a local library would take in found items, but the Altadena
Public Library, along with more than 9,000 homes, burned to the ground.
Librarians are redirecting residents who have found photos to
Schwartz. </p>
<p>She adopted parts of her process from what she learned as an archival
intern at the Corita Art Center — protecting photos in acid-free,
glassine envelopes and storing them in a waterproof box in a
temperature-controlled room with good air circulation. </p>
<p>Last week, she made her first match: disposable camera photos of
teenagers, smiling, in prom dresses and glittering tiaras. The image is
flecked with damage, but all four corners are intact. </p>
<p>“It’s funny — you formulate these ideas of who the person is,”
Schwartz said. “She was kind of exactly what I pictured, just really
friendly and bubbly and lovely — you could tell that just from her
photos.” </p>
<p>Schwartz’s house survived because her neighbors stayed behind to
fight the fire themselves, but the landscape around it — full of
burned-out lots, ghostly palm trees and blackened telephone poles — is
otherworldly and changed. “It looks like the moon. It looks like another
planet. It doesn’t look like home.” </p>
<p>Nearby is Joshua Simpson, a photographer who lost his Altadena home
and studio, along with decades of film negatives, silver gelatin prints
and camera equipment. But something meaningful survived. </p>
<p>“The very first thing we found was this beautiful vintage print of my
mother-in-law holding my wife when she was a newborn baby,” said
Simpson. The black-and-white photo carries an extra layer of poignancy,
as his mother-in-law died just few months ago. “We were both pretty
overjoyed in that moment. It felt a little magical finding that
one.” </p>
<p>Above all, Ackerman said, personal safety comes first. “When you’re
picking up people’s heirlooms or family photographs, that can be
traumatic — even if they’re not yours,” he said. </p>
<p>When people survive catastrophic events such as wildfires or
hurricanes, and are left to cope with loss, they may express a wide
range of emotions — from overwhelmed to outraged to numb sometimes all
at once. Tragedies, though, can also strengthen the ties in communities,
and people like Schenker and Schwartz are Exhibits A and B. </p>
<p>“Disasters like this really bring out the best in people,” Moss said.
“You know, I can laugh or I can cry about it — and I choose to laugh
about it. Fortunately, we didn’t lose the most important thing. That’s
lives.”</p>

anthem boos in stormy US-Canada ice hockey clash</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MONTREAL — Three fights in the first nine seconds and a chorus of
deafening boos for the US national anthem marked a stormy ice hockey
clash between the United States and Canada in Montreal on Saturday.</p>
<p>An emotionally charged showdown between the star-studded lineups of
the North American rivals – which comes against a backdrop of political
tension between the two neighboring countries – erupted into violence
from the opening puck drop at Montreal’s Bell Centre.</p>
<p>The U.S. squad clinched a spot in the 4 Nations Face-Off final
Thursday at Boston with a 3-1 victory, but the result was almost a
footnote to the mayhem that marked the start of a game played before a
fiercely partisan Canadian crowd.</p>
<p>With Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the crowd, home fans
booed The Star-Spangled Banner before the game, catcalls that have
become a regular feature at NHL and NBA games in Canada since U.S.
President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Canadian goods
crossing U.S. borders.</p>
<p>Then came three fights in nine seconds.</p>
<p>“I just think it’s very indicative of what this means to the
players,” U.S. coach Mike Sullivan said. “There’s two teams out there
that are very competitive, that have a ton of pride for their respective
teams and their countries.</p>
<p>“For me, when you have an investment in trying to win like the way
that it occurred – I think that’s an indication of it. What an
incredible hockey game.”</p>
<p>Canada coach Jon Cooper, the two-time Stanley Cup champion coach for
Tampa Bay who will guide the Canadian 2026 Olympic team, said the melee
in the first moments was not prearranged.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t planned,” Cooper said. “That wasn’t two coaches throwing
guys over and saying ‘This is happening’ – none of that happened. That
was as organic as it gets.”</p>
<p>At the opening puck drop, the gloves came off for real on the ice as
Canada’s Brandon Hagel and Matthew Tkachuk of the United States began
swinging punches as the crowd went wild and teammates skated back to
give the brawlers a clear stage at center ice.</p>
<p>Referees restored order, sent the combatants to the penalty box and
tried to restart the game, only for Canada’s Sam Bennett and Brady
Tkachuk of the Americans to drop their gloves and trade punches until
officials could break them apart, Tkachuk following his brother into the
penalty box.</p>
<p>The game was restarted but only got to nine seconds before American
J.T. Miller and Canada’s Colton Parayko began the third and final
fight.</p>
<p>‘Jacked up’</p>
<p>Asked about U.S. players having agreed on the fight-filled start
beforehand on a group chat, Sullivan said he was unaware of such a
move.</p>
<p>“These guys care very much about winning,” he said. “Brady and
Matthew, they play the game with so much emotion – and they’re leaders
in so many ways.</p>
<p>“It’s just an indication of how much these guys care and how bad they
want to win. I was not aware of it. Obviously, there’s a lot of energy
around this game. I knew we were going to be jacked up to play.”</p>
<p>Top NHL players from the United States and Canada had not faced off
against each other for their home nations since the 2016 World Cup of
Hockey, the league’s best traditionally skipping the world championships
and the NHL having chosen not to send its players to the 2018
PyeongChang or 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>“It was probably I guess 10 years of no international hockey exhaled
in a minute and a half,” Cooper said.</p>
<p>The intense drama continued once the game began in earnest with
Canada going ahead on Connor McDavid’s goal 5:31 into the first
period.</p>
<p>But the Americans equalized on Jake Guentzel’s goal at 10:15 of the
first period and the U.S. went ahead to stay on Dylan Larkin’s tally at
13:33 of the second period. The Americans sealed the triumph on
Guentzel’s empty-net goal with 1:19 remaining in the third period.</p>

South Korea, Japan reaffirm pledge to seek denuclearization of North
Korea</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MUNICH — The United States, Japan and South Korea renewed their
“resolute” pledge to seek the “complete denuclearization” of North
Korea, according to a joint statement from the three allies released
Saturday.</p>
<p>The statement came after new U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio held
his first meetings with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and
Japan’s top diplomat Takeshi Iwaya on the sidelines of the Munich
Security Conference on Saturday.</p>
<p>“The Secretary and Foreign Ministers reaffirmed their resolute
commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Democratic People’s
Republic of Korea (DPRK) in accordance with the United Nations Security
Council Resolutions (UNSCRs),” it said.</p>
<p>“They expressed their serious concerns over and the need to address
together the DPRK’s nuclear and missile programs, malicious cyber
activities including cryptocurrency thefts, and increasing military
cooperation with Russia,” it added.</p>
<p>The three sent a “strong warning” that they “will not tolerate any
provocations or threats to their homelands,” and vowed to maintain and
strengthen international sanctions against Pyongyang.</p>
<p>They also said they were committed to “the immediate resolution of
the issues of abductees, detainees, and unrepatriated prisoners of war
as well as the issue of separated families.”</p>
<p>Largely cut off from the world diplomatically and economically, and
under a bevy of sanctions, North Korea with its ongoing nuclear weapons
program has been a major thorn in the side of the United States for
years.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump, who had a rare series of meetings with Kim
Jong Un during his first term in office, has said he will reach out
again to the North Korean leader, calling Kim a “smart guy.”</p>
<p>Despite Trump’s diplomatic overtures, North Korea said in January
that its nuclear program would continue “indefinitely.”</p>
<p>Pyongyang also said earlier this month it would not tolerate any
“provocation” by the United States after Rubio called it a “rogue state”
in a radio interview.</p>
<p>It has also slammed a visit by a U.S. nuclear submarine to a naval
base in South Korea this month as a “hostile military act.”</p>
<p>A summit between Trump and Kim in Hanoi collapsed in 2019 over talks
on sanctions relief and what Pyongyang would be willing to give up in
return.</p>

<h2 id="us-fires-20-immigration-judges-from-backlogged-courts">US fires
20 immigration judges from backlogged courts</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA — The administration of U.S. President Donald
Trump has fired 20 immigration judges without explanation, a union
official said Saturday amid sweeping moves to shrink the size of the
federal government. </p>
<p>On Friday, 13 judges who had yet to be sworn in and five assistant
chief immigration judges were dismissed without notice, said Matthew
Biggs, president of the International Federation of Professional &amp;
Technical Engineers, which represents federal workers. Two other judges
were fired under similar circumstances in the last week. </p>
<p>It was unclear if they would be replaced. The U.S. Justice
Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review, which runs the
courts and oversees its roughly 700 judges, did not immediately respond
to a request for comment Saturday. </p>
<p>Immigration courts are backlogged with more than 3.7 million cases,
according to Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access
Clearinghouse. Applicants can wait years for their asylum case to be
decided. There is support across the political spectrum for more judges
and support staff, though the first Trump administration also pressured
some judges to decide cases more quickly. </p>
<p>The Trump administration earlier replaced five top court officials,
including Mary Cheng, the agency’s acting director. Sirce Owen, the
current leader and previously an appellate immigration judge, has issued
a slew of new instructions, many reversing policies of the Biden
administration. </p>
<p>Last month, the Justice Department halted financial support for
nongovernmental organizations to provide information and guidance to
people facing deportation but restored funding after a coalition of
nonprofit groups filed a federal lawsuit. </p>
<p>The firings touch on two top Trump priorities: mass deportations and
shrinking the size of the federal government. On Thursday, it ordered
agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who had not yet
gained civil service protection, potentially affecting hundreds of
thousands of workers. Probationary workers generally have less than a
year on the job.</p>

East faces flooding as snow forecast for Northeast, cold in Midwest</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY — Much of the Eastern U.S. endured a renewed
round of harsh, soggy weather Saturday, with snowstorms predicted in the
Northeast and heavy winds bringing the threat of tornadoes to the
Mississippi Valley.</p>
<p>The states of Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia and Arkansas were
under flood warnings, and people were warned by the National Weather
Service to stay off the roads. Parts of western Kentucky could face up
to 20.3 centimeters of rain.</p>
<p>Governor Andy Beshear preemptively declared a state of emergency in
Kentucky, where flash flooding was expected into Sunday.</p>
<p>“We want to specifically put assets in places that flood and have
flooded in the past,” Beshear said on social media.</p>
<p>Photos posted by authorities and users on social media showed cars
and buildings underwater in Warren County, Kentucky, and in Buchanan
County, Virginia, where the sheriff’s office said multiple roads were
blocked by mudslides.</p>
<p>The Simpson County Office of Emergency Management in Kentucky said
authorities performed several rescues from stalled-out vehicles in
floodwaters.</p>
<p>“Stay home if you can,” the office said on Facebook.</p>
<p>Flash flooding was possible in the Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio
valleys, the weather service said. In Tennessee, flash flood warnings
were issued for much of the middle of the state through the evening.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service called the expected rain a “major,
potentially historic, flash flood event.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile heavy snow was expected to blanket much of New England and
then transition to sleet, making travel nearly impossible. The heaviest
accumulations — possibly 30.5 centimeters or more — were expected in
upstate New York and portions of northern New England.</p>
<p>“Ice accumulations up to a quarter inch (half a centimeter) are
forecast for some areas, making driving conditions dangerous. Heavy
icing in some locations may result in downed trees and power outages,”
the weather service warned.</p>
<p>Snow and arctic temperatures swept much of the Midwest and Upper
Plains, covering roads in eastern Nebraska, northern Iowa and much of
Wisconsin. Winter weather advisories were issued for parts of those
states and Michigan, with up to 10.6 centimeters of snow predicted
throughout Iowa, southern Wisconsin and most of Michigan by Sunday
evening.</p>
<p>Frigid polar vortex</p>
<p>Meteorologists said the U.S. was about to get its 10th and coldest
polar vortex stretching event this season, with the northern Rockies and
northern Plains first in line. Weather forces in the Arctic are
combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole
into the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>In Denver, where temperatures were expected to dip as low as minus 10
degrees Celsius over the weekend, the city opened shelters for those
living on the streets.</p>
<p>Forecasters reported 2.5 centimeters of snow falling every hour just
north of Denver.</p>
<p>The weather service also warned of extreme cold in the Upper Plains
over the coming days, with wind chills ranging from minus 34 degree
Celsius to as low as minus 51 degrees Celsius in parts of western
Montana, North Dakota, northern South Dakota and western Minnesota.
People in those areas were urged to stay indoors and make provisions to
shelter livestock and other animals.</p>
<p>California struggles with mudslides</p>
<p>Dry weather returned to Southern California after the strongest storm
of the year. But the risk of rockslides and mudslides on
wildfire-scarred hillsides continued because dangerous slides can strike
even after rain stops, particularly in areas where vegetation that helps
keep soil anchored has burned away.</p>
<p>Water, debris and boulders rushed down the mountain in the city of
Sierra Madre on Thursday night, trapping at least one car in the mud and
damaging several homes with mud and debris. Bulldozers cleaned up
mud-covered streets in the city of 10,000 people.</p>
<p>A storm in the Sierra Nevada dumped 1.8 meters of snow over 36 hours.
Two Mammoth Mountain ski patrol workers were caught in an avalanche
during avalanche mitigation work Friday morning, the resort said in a
Facebook post. One was extracted and was responsive, while the other was
taken to a hospital with serious injuries.</p>

id="irs-to-lay-off-thousands-of-probationary-workers-in-tax-season">IRS
to lay off thousands of probationary workers in tax season</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will lay off
thousands of probationary workers in the middle of tax season, according
to two sources familiar with the agency’s plans, and the cuts could
happen as soon as next week.</p>
<p>The Trump administration intensified sweeping efforts to shrink the
size of the federal workforce. It is doing it by ordering agencies to
lay off nearly all probationary employees who had not yet gained civil
service protection.</p>
<p>It’s unclear how many IRS workers will be affected.</p>
<p>Previously, the administration announced a plan to offer buyouts to
almost all federal employees through a “deferred resignation program” to
quickly reduce the government workforce. The program deadline was
Feb. 6, and administration officials said employees who accept will be
able to stop working while still collecting a paycheck until
Sept. 30.</p>
<p>However, IRS employees involved in the 2025 tax season were told they
will not be allowed to accept a buyout offer from the Trump
administration until after the taxpayer filing deadline, according to a
letter sent recently to IRS employees.</p>
<p>It is unclear how many workers will be impacted by the layoff
announcement plan. Representatives from the U.S. Treasury and IRS did
not respond to Associated Press requests for comment.</p>
<p>Jan. 27 was the official start date of the 2025 tax season, and the
IRS expects more than 140 million tax returns to be filed by the April
15 deadline. The Biden administration invested heavily in the IRS
through an $80 billion infusion of funds in Democrats’ Inflation
Reduction Act, which included plans to hire tens of thousands of new
employees to help with customer service and enforcement as well as new
technology to update the tax collection agency.</p>
<p>Republicans have been successful at clawing back that money, and
billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency have
called for the U.S. to “delete entire agencies” from the federal
government as part of his plan to radically cut spending and restructure
its priorities.</p>
<p>Elected officials are trying to fight against DOGE plans. Attorneys
general from 14 states challenged the authority of DOGE to access
sensitive government data and exercise “virtually unchecked power” in a
lawsuit filed Thursday.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, says the actions
taken by Musk at the helm of DOGE can only be taken by a nominated and
Senate-confirmed official. It cites constitutional provisions that
delineate the powers of Congress and the president.</p>
