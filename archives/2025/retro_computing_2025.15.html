<p>date: 2025-04-18, from: RiscOS Story</p>
<p>Jeroen Vermeulen has turned his gaze upon another title in the Code
the Classics Volume II tome, and successfully brought it to RISC OS.
This time the game is Leading Edge, a racing game inspired by the
classic Pole Position. The objective of the game is quite simple: Race
against the other drivers, and try to achieve as good a finishing
position and time as possible. You start off the race in last position,
and you’ll have to weave away around the other cars to pass them while
trying to…</p>

Wget to provide an interface between the RISC OS desktop and a remote
site, allowing users to seek out information without having to wrestle
with a web browser. This time it’s the turn of CardInfo with the release
of version 1.02. The program can be used to look up information about
your plastic pals. If you feed it the first six digits of a bank card

<h2 id="computes-gazette-revived-for-july-2025">COMPUTE!’s Gazette
revived for July 2025</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-14, from: Old Ventage Computing Research</p>
COMPUTE!’s Gazette was for many years the leading Commodore-specific
managzine. I liked Ahoy! and RUN, and I subscribed to Loadstar too, but
Gazette had the most interesting type-ins and the most extensive
coverage. They were also the last of COMPUTE!’s machine-specific
magazines and one of the longest lived Commodore publications, period:
yours truly had some articles published in COMPUTE (no exclamation point
by then) Gazette as a youthful freelancer in the 1990s until General
Media eventually made Gazette disk-only and then halted entirely in
1995. I remember pitching Tom Netzel on a column idea and getting a
cryptic E-mail back from him saying that “things were afoot.” What was
afoot was General Media divesting the entire publication to Ziff-Davis,
who was only interested in the mailing list, and I got a wholly
inadequate subscription to PC Magazine in exchange which I mostly didn’t
read and eventually didn’t renew.
<p>
This week I saw an announcement about a rebooted Gazette — even with a
print edition, and restoring the classic ABC/Cap Cities trade dress —
slated for release
<a href="https://www.computesgazette.com/iconic-computes-gazette-magazine-returns-after-35-years-expanding-focus-to-entire-retro-computing-community/">in
July</a>. I’m guessing that “president and founder [sic]” Edwin Nagle
either bought or licensed the name from Ziff-Davis when forming the new
COMPUTE! Media; the announcement also doesn’t say if he only has rights
to the name, or if he actually has access to the back catalogue, which I
think could be more lucrative: since there appears to be print capacity,
seems like there could be some money in low-run back issue reprints or
even reissuing some of their disk products, assuming any residual or
royalty arrangements could be dealt with. I should say for the record
that I don’t have anything to do with the company myself and I don’t
know Nagle personally.
<p>
<p>By and large I naturally think this is a good thing, and I’ll
probably try to get a copy, though the stated aim of the magazine is
more COMPUTE! and less Gazette since it intends to cover the entire
retro community. Doing so may be the only way to ensure an adequate
amount of content at a monthly cadence, so I get the reasoning, but it
necessarily won’t be the Gazette you remember. Also, since most retro
enthusiasts have some means to push downloaded data to their machines,
the type-in features which were the predominant number of pages in the
1980s will almost certainly be diminished or absent. I suspect you’ll
see something more like the General Media incarnation, which was a few
type-ins slotted between various regular columns, reviews and feature
articles. The print rate strikes me as very reasonable at
<a href="https://www.computesgazette.com/subscribe-to-computes-gazette-stay-updated-on-the-latest-retro-trends/">$9.95/mo</a>
for a low-volume rag and I hope they can keep that up, though they would
need to be finishing the content for layout fairly soon and the only
proferred sample articles seem to be on
<a href="https://www.computesgazette.com/blog">their blog</a>. I’m at
most cautiously optimistic right now, but the fact they’re starting up
at all is nice to see, and I hope it goes somewhere.</p>
