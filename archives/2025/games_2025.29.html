<p>date: 2025-07-22, updated: 2025-07-22, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>What are the best games on PlayStation 5? Now that supply issues are
over, Sony’s latest console is flying off shelves, while its library of

<p>Remember Mega Evolution? The power-up was a major draw for Pokémon X
and Y, which introduced it as an ability that transformed select
monsters into enormous, more powerful versions of themselves back in
2013. The mechanic is back for the action-oriented Pokémon Legends: Z-A,

<p>It’s been a month since Netflix’s K-Pop Demon Hunters took the
internet by storm, thrusting us into a world of, well, demon-hunting
K-Pop music. The fever is not subsiding; at the time of writing, the

<p>Bramble Country is a challenge level in Donkey Kong Bananza that

<p>The big main thing you want to do in Donkey Kong Bananza is smash
everything, but even as you shatter various layers of the planet into
thousands of tiny voxels, you may realize there’s more to life than

remake, you’d probably think the hardest part of the job would be the

<p>Deadline reported this week that Netflix is working on a live-action
adaptation of the ’90s animated series Captain Planet and the
