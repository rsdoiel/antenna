Country walkthrough in Donkey Kong Bananza</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-21, updated: 2025-07-21, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Bramble Country is a challenge level in Donkey Kong Bananza that
continues one of the game’s patterns: Sticking one Banandium Gem in an
easy-to-miss but hard-to-reach spot. This one is slightly more devious
than the other challenge levels, though. You can’t use your hand slap
sonar to show where it’s hiding. In this Donkey Kong […]</p>

<p>Ancient Bananza Powers allow you to transform into different animals
in Donkey Kong Bananza and turn their abilities into your own. Whether
you want to punch through walls, fly through the skies, or run on water,
Ancient Bananza Powers can do it all. However, these transformations
aren’t available from the get-go. They can only be […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-21, updated: 2025-07-21, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>After three years of silence, Rockstar Games surprised the world with
an update for Red Dead Online, the MMO-lite spinoff of its acclaimed
open-world western. Strange Tales of the West is a humble affair
compared to previous updates, which introduced things like new classes,
but players are saddling up and joining posses all the same. […]</p>

<p>In Donkey Kong Bananza, you’ll hit The Junction after completing the
Forest or Freezer Layer. It’s another small layer, similar to The
Divide, but it still has some Banandium Gems that can be tricky to find
if you’re not paying attention. The Junction is mostly just a small
pathway forward and it’ll initially be covered […]</p>

<p>Elle Fanning is no stranger to sci-fi or aliens in general, but this
time it looks like she’s bitten off more than she can chew as the
Weyland-Yutani android Thia in the upcoming Predator: Badlands. The last

<p>The summer before NetEase released Marvel Rivals, the wildly popular
6v6 hero shooter, a Marvel editor reached out to writer Paul Allor,
asking if they might be interested in writing a little comic series to

Allor’s first time writing superheroes over their 14-year career, though

<p>If someone still believed that the incredible success of Demon
