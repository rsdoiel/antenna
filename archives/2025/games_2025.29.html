<p>date: 2025-07-27, updated: 2025-07-25, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Ten years after Bloodborne‘s release, its fans are still exploring
the game and finding new secrets, while stubbornly waiting waiting for a
sequel. I also wish for more stories about old secrets and the dreams of
hunters. The hopes for a possible sequel only make me more eager to get

<p>If someone had told me that my most recent hyperfixation, the Netflix
phenomenon known as KPop Demon Hunters, would cross with my oldest, most

skipped Hall H in favor of releasing The Fantastic Four: First Steps in
