<p>date: 2025-07-20, updated: 2025-07-20, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Who could’ve guessed that Donkey Kong Bananza would launch with a
secret game mode for players needing a break from collecting,
platforming, and smashing through levels? The DK Artist game mode allows
players to experiment with the Nintendo Switch 2’s mouse controls and,
as the name suggests, create art pieces. In this Donkey Kong Bananza

<p>The Freezer Layer is the fifth layer in Donkey Kong Bananza. The
Freezer is snowy land home to sweet treats, zebras, and, of course, lots
of Banandium Gems. As you traverse through the Freezer, you’ll need to

or receive one in a post-launch update. Donkey Kong Bananza is no
exception, featuring a solid set of virtual photography tools designed

<p>The big main thing you want to do in Donkey Kong Bananza is smash
everything, but even as you shatter various layers of the planet into
thousands of tiny voxels, you may realize there’s more to life than
smashing. On your quest to reaching the surface (and getting more
bananas), you should know there are […]</p>

<p>If you know anything about the process of shooting an effects-heavy,
big-budget movie like 2025’s live-action How to Train Your Dragon
remake, you’d probably think the hardest part of the job would be the
performance: trying to have convincing emotional relationships with
characters that’ll be added digitally later. Or maybe it’d be all the
stunts, […]</p>

<p>Deadline reported this week that Netflix is working on a live-action
adaptation of the ’90s animated series Captain Planet and the
Planeteers, a project which has been in development hell for nearly a
decade. While that’s great news for ’90s animation fans, I’m hoping it
paves the way for the revival of a different ’90s […]</p>
