In my previous life, before returning to journalism, I owned a bustling
specialist dog shop. We
<a href="https://www.familyhandyman.com/project/how-to-install-luxury-vinyl-flooring/" rel="noopener noreferrer">installed
luxury vinyl plank flooring</a> because it’s durable, stands up well to
enthusiastic claws, and is easy to clean when there are those inevitable
puppy potty puddles. When I sold the business after ten years, the
flooring was still going strong. Learning how to properly clean vinyl
plank flooring contributed to the surface’s longevity.

<p>
I spoke with two experts to get their cleaning tips for keeping your
flooring sparkling without risking discoloration or scratches.
