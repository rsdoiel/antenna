## Opinion: Is the Linux community really elitist?

date: 2025-04-28, from: Libre News

The Linux community is often portrayed as elitist or prone to gatekeeping, but, nowadays, the opposite is true: the community really wants to help you grow, so you can give back one day. You should, however, be careful about niche sub-communities where people's behaviour is not ideal.

## New dashboard: alt text for all my images

date: 2025-04-28, updated: 2025-04-28, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://simonwillison.net/dashboard/alt-text/">New dashboard: alt text for all my images</a></strong></p>
I got curious today about how I'd been using alt text for images on my blog, and realized that since I have <a href="https://django-sql-dashboard.datasette.io/">Django SQL Dashboard</a> running on this site and PostgreSQL is capable of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454#1732454">parsing HTML with regular expressions</a> I could probably find out using a SQL query.</p>
<p>I pasted <a href="https://simonwillison.net/dashboard/schema/">my PostgreSQL schema</a> into Claude and gave it a pretty long prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Give this PostgreSQL schema I want a query that returns all of my images and their alt text. Images are sometimes stored as HTML image tags and other times stored in markdown.</p>
<p><code>blog_quotation.quotation</code>, <code>blog_note.body</code> both contain markdown. <code>blog_blogmark.commentary</code> has markdown if <code>use_markdown</code> is true or HTML otherwise. <code>blog_entry.body</code> is always HTML</p>
<p>Write me a SQL query to extract all of my images and their alt tags using regular expressions. In HTML documents it should look for either <code>&lt;img .* src="..." .* alt="..."</code> or <code>&lt;img alt="..." .* src="..."</code> (images may be self-closing XHTML style in some places). In Markdown they will always be <code>![alt text](url)</code></p>
<p>I want the resulting table to have three columns: URL, alt_text, src - the URL column needs to be constructed as e.g. <code>/2025/Feb/2/slug</code> for a record where created is on 2nd feb 2025 and the <code>slug</code> column contains <code>slug</code></p>
<p>Use CTEs and unions where appropriate</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It almost got it right on the first go, and with <a href="https://claude.ai/share/e3b996d3-b480-436d-aa40-9caa7609474f">a couple of follow-up prompts</a> I had the query I wanted. I also added the option to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/dashboard/alt-text/?search=pelican">search</a> my alt text / image URLs, which has already helped me hunt down and fix a few old images on expired domain names. Here's a copy of <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/5b44a662354e124e33cc1d4704cdb91a">the finished 100 line SQL query</a>.

## Episode 156 - RPG, a Different Paradigm?

date: 2025-04-27, from: Advent of Computing

<p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">How do you make a computer act less like a computer? It sounds like some kind of riddle, but in the early 1960s it was an actual problem. As IBM customers transitioned from tabulators to computers they ran into all sorts of practical issues. Programmers became a hot commodity. But how do you find a programmer in 1959? And how can you even afford such a luxury? Wouldn't it be better if you could just use your new computer as a tabulator? Well, with RPG, all that and more was possible.</p>
