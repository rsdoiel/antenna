<h2 id="public-data-file-now-available">2025 public data file now
available</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-12, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
Every year we release metadata for the full corpus of records registered
with us, which can be downloaded for free in a single compressed file.
This is one way in which we fulfil our mission to make metadata freely
and widely available. By including the metadata of over 165 million
research outputs from over 20,000 members worldwide and making them
available in a standard format, we streamline access to metadata about
scholarly objects such as journal articles, books, conference papers,
preprints, research grants, standards, datasets, reports, blogs, and
more.
</p>
<p>
Our metadata is used by thousands of services, researchers, and other
organisations. We make it openly available
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/retrieve-metadata/">through
our APIs</a>, which can be used to obtain a subset of records. If you
want to work with our full corpus, the best way is to get a copy of the
public data file and update it via the
<a href="https://api.crossref.org" target="_blank">REST API</a> with any
new records created or changed since its release.
</p>
<p>
By providing an annual copy of the full corpus, we also expand the ways
in which the metadata can be used and interrogated. It is ideal for
groups using large samples of the scholarly record, such as
metaresearchers or research integrity experts. You can find examples of
the public data file used in
<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14766414" target="_blank">research
on journal editorial practices</a> and in
<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4734512" target="_blank">projects
investigating gaps in the scholarly record</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="how-to-access-the-public-data-file">
How to access the public data file
</h2>
<p>
The total size of the file is 197 GB and it is available in JSON-lines
format. We also provide an experimental tool to convert the file
<a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/labs/dois2sqlite" target="_blank">to
an Sqlite database</a>. Before downloading the full dataset, you may
wish to download the sample dataset containing 100 files (with 100
records in each, around 24 MB). This is a randomly sampled subset of
metadata records and can be used for prototyping and development.
</p>
<p>
To get a copy of the annual data file you can access it directly via
<a href="https://doi.org/10.13003/87bfgcee6g" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.13003/87bfgcee6g</a>,
or get the sample dataset and previous public data files from
<a href="https://academictorrents.com/browse.php?search=Crossref" target="_blank">Academic
Torrents</a>. We make a donation to Academic Torrents to support their
work, which allows the data to be accessible in this way. Some
organisations have reported policies that prevent access to torrents, so
we provide a copy that can be downloaded from AWS, which requires an AWS
account and a small payment to cover the data transfer costs. You can
find the details about access
[here](/documentation/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/tips-for-using-public-data-files-and-plus].
</p>
<p>
We have some
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/learning/public-data-file/">tips for
working with the public data file</a>. If you would like to have access
to monthly snapshots of the whole corpus, along with higher API rate
limits and other benefits, you can subscribe to
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/metadata-plus/">Metadata
Plus</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="whats-different-this-year">
What’s different this year?
</h2>
<p>
This year’s public data file contains an additional 9 million records,
and many updates to previously deposited records. The formats and method
of access are the same as last year, except that it uses JSON lines,
meaning that each metadata record is on a single line and the file
suffix is jsonl instead of json. The records have been sorted by DOI,
meaning it should be easier to navigate.
</p>
<p>
A change this year is that the file does not contain aliased DOIs, which
are DOI that are redirected to another DOI. Aliasing is necessary on
rare occasions, for example when two DOIs are registered for the same
content. Previously we haven’t indicated aliasing in the REST API and
public data files; this year only the prime DOIs (the ones to which they
are redirected) are included. This makes statistical analysis of the
metadata more accurate, but beware that it may give different results in
cases where many aliased DOIs were previously counted. See
<a href="https://community.crossref.org/t/adding-redirects-for-aliased-dois-in-the-rest-api/13138" target="_blank">this
community forum post</a> for more details.
</p>
<p>
The file also contains retractions from the Retraction Watch database,
which was
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/news-crossref-and-retraction-watch/">acquired
by Crossref in September 2023</a> and recently
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/retraction-watch-retractions-now-in-the-crossref-api/">integrated
into the REST API</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you have questions, want to let us know how you will use the
metadata, or want to discuss anything on the topic of retrieving
Crossref metadata, head to our
<a href="https://community.crossref.org/c/metadata-retrieval/27" target="_blank">community
forum</a>. From there, you can also keep updated about changes to our
schema and APIs.
