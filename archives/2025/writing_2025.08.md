## The Orb of Cairado by Katherine Addison: Review by Abigail Nussbaum

date: 2025-02-24, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>The Orb of Cairado</strong>, Katherine Addison (Subterranean 978-1-64524-213-0, 120pp, $45.00, hc) January 2025. Cover by Tom Canty.</p>
<p>A similar question arises for the protagonist of the standalone novella <strong>The Orb of Cairado</strong>. Like the Cemeteries of Amalo books, it is an offshoot of Addison’s Hugo, Nebula, and World Fantasy Award-nominated novel <strong>The Goblin Emperor </strong>(2014) – more directly, perhaps, as their actions kick off from the same event,  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/02/the-orb-of-cairado-by-katherine-addison-review-by-abigail-nussbaum/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## The Year in Review 2024 by Graham Sleight

date: 2025-02-24, from: Locus Magazine

<p>Some years, it feels like there’s a central book in SF and fantasy, one around which the conversation orbits. A few obvious ex­amples: <strong>Neuromancer </strong>in 1984, <strong>Ancillary Justice </strong>in 2013, <strong>This Is How You Lose the Time War </strong>in 2019. In my reading, 2024 was not such a year. There were plenty of good books – see below – but as a year it felt curiously decentered, as if the  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/02/the-year-in-review-2024-by-graham-sleight/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
