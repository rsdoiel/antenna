<p><strong>One Level Down</strong>, Mary G. Thompson (Tachyon 978-1-61696-430-6, $16.95, 176pp, tp) April 2025.</p>
<p>Mary G. Thompson is another middle-grade and young-adult author now venturing into adult SF with <strong>One Level Down</strong>, an efficient VR thriller with some fairly familiar elements skillfully handled and given additional punch by a memorable narrator, a megalomaniacal villain who echoes the ‘‘mad scientists’’ of yore, and a persistent undertone of psychological horror.

<p>During a recent trip to Singapore, I went book shopping. The science fic­tion and fantasy shelves of the Books Kinokuniya on Orchard Road predomi­nantly featured familiar titles, but there were also a good number of locally published books by writers unknown to me. The specific publisher that caught my eye was Penguin Random House SEA, perhaps because in the UK almost all the SF titles with a penguin on the  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/02/the-year-in-review-2024-by-niall-harrison/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

## Coup de Grâce by Sofia Ajram: Review by Gabino Iglesias

<p><strong>Coup de Grâce</strong>, Sofia Ajram (Titan Books 978-1-80336-962-4, $19.99, 144pp, hc) October 2024.</p>
<p>Sofia Ajram’s <strong>Coup de Grâce </strong>is a relentlessly dark and visceral novel about a man on his way to commit suicide who somehow becomes trapped in the endless liminal space of an empty subway station. Beautifully written and claustrophobic in the way only empty liminal spaces can be, this short novel delivers breathtaking lines along with  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/02/coup-de-grace-by-sofia-ajram-review-by-gabino-iglesias/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

<p>It is impossible for me to overstate how much I enjoy the novels of Katherine Addison set in the world of <strong>The Goblin Emperor</strong>.

## The River Has Roots by Amal El-Mohtar: Review by Gary K. Wolfe

<p><strong>The River Has Roots</strong>, Amal El-Mohtar (Tordotcom 978-1-250-34108-2, $24.99, 144pp, hc) March 2025.</p>
<p>Amal El-Mohtar’s <strong>The River Has Roots </strong>is an absolutely lovely take on classic murder ballads, with distinct echoes of the Tam Lin story and a soundtrack that might as well be wall-to-wall Steeleye Span. It might come as a bit of a surprise to readers who know El-Mohtar’s work only from the popular and multiple award-winning  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/02/the-river-has-roots-by-amal-el-mohtar-review-by-gary-k-wolfe/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>

</div> 
<p>So you’ve decided you want to be a screenwriter and write your very own screenplay for a feature film, TV show, or new media platform.&nbsp;<br><br>This is a unique skillset, because film and television are visual mediums and collaborative art forms. Because of this, a screenplay needs to be formatted in a specific way. These days, most writers invest in <a href="https://www.finaldraft.com/company/why-screenwriting-software/">screenwriting software</a> that automatically formats their scripts to industry standard formatting, so this part of the process is not nearly as daunting as it was in the past.&nbsp;<br><br>However, even with screenwriting software, if you’re a beginner writer, you might not know the best way to approach the blank page and fill it with ideas for a movie, TV series or any kind of narrative content you’re looking to create. And just like any skillset, it’s possible to learn and eventually excel at screenplay writing.<br><br>Below are <span style="font-weight: bold;">5 Easy Steps to Writing a Screenplay</span>:</p>

## The Year in Review 2024 by Graham Sleight

date: 2025-02-24, from: Locus Magazine

<p>Some years, it feels like there’s a central book in SF and fantasy, one around which the conversation orbits. A few obvious ex­amples: <strong>Neuromancer </strong>in 1984, <strong>Ancillary Justice </strong>in 2013, <strong>This Is How You Lose the Time War </strong>in 2019. In my reading, 2024 was not such a year. There were plenty of good books – see below – but as a year it felt curiously decentered, as if the  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/02/the-year-in-review-2024-by-graham-sleight/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
