## Computational biology and artificial intelligence in mRNA vaccine design for cancer immunotherapy

date: 2025-01-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines offer an adaptable and scalable platform for cancer immunotherapy, requiring optimal design to elicit a robust and targeted immune response. Recent advancements in bioinformatics and artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly enhanced the design, prediction, and optimization of mRNA vaccines. This paper reviews technologies that streamline mRNA vaccine development, from genomic sequencing to lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation. We discuss how accurate predictions of neoantigen structures guide the design of mRNA sequences that effectively target immune and cancer cells. Furthermore, we examine AI-driven approaches that optimize mRNA-LNP formulations, enhancing delivery and stability. These technological innovations not only improve vaccine design but also enhance pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, offering promising avenues for personalized cancer immunotherapy.

## Vitamin D supplementation during intensive care unit stay is associated with improved outcomes in critically Ill patients with sepsis: a cohort study

date: 2025-01-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundPatients with vitamin D deficiency are susceptible to increased microbial infection and increased risk of mortality. However, whether vitamin D supplementation would improve their prognosis remains uncertain.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from MIMIC-IV database, a publicly available database containing clinical information on patients admitted to the ICU at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) from 2008 to 2019. Adult patients with sepsis were included in the analysis. The exposure factor was vitamin D supplementation during the ICU stay. The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality. Both propensity score matching (PSM) and stepwise regression analyses were employed to adjust for potential confounders.ResultsA total of 20230 eligible patients were enrolled in the entire unmatched cohort, and 8710 patients were included in the matched cohort. In PSM analysis, the 28-day all-cause mortality rate was 14.04% (250/1780) in the vitamin D group and 22.31% (1546/6930) in the no vitamin D group. Vitamin D supplementation was associated with decreased 28-day all-cause mortality (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.49-0.64; p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses showed consistent benefits regardless of the baseline vitamin D status (deficiency: HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.33-1.50; p = 0.36; insufficiency: HR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.03-0.34; p < 0.001; sufficiency: HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.12-0.88; p = 0.03). Additionally, vitamin D supplementation was associated with decreased ICU mortality (OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.29-0.48; p < 0.001) and reduced in-hospital mortality (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.48-0.68; p < 0.001). Sensitivity analysis using the unmatched cohort confirmed these findings (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.43-0.76; p < 0.001).ConclusionsVitamin D supplementation may reduce mortality in critically ill patients with sepsis. However, further high-quality prospective studies are still needed to validate these findings.

## SERINC5 counters retroviruses and non-retroviruses

date: 2025-01-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

SERINC5 (serine incorporator 5), a member of the serine incorporator family, has been identified as a retrovirus restriction factor that inhibits the fusion of virions with the plasma membrane, thus blocking the release of the viral core into target cells and subsequently attenuating viral infectivity. Several viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), murine leukemia virus (MLV), and equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), have evolved mechanisms to antagonize the host protein SERINC5 through HIV Nef, MLV glycosylated Gag, and the EIAV S2 protein. These viral proteins degrade SERINC5 on the cell surface through the endolysosomal system. In addition to its direct antiviral ability, SERINC5 also modulates immunity to inhibit the replication of retroviruses and nonretroviruses. This review summarizes the interaction between SERINC5 and viral replication, providing a promising avenue for fighting viral diseases.

## A mouse model of immunosuppression facilitates oral Candida albicans biofilms, bacterial dysbiosis and dissemination of infection

date: 2025-01-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Opportunistic pathogens are a major threat to people, especially those with impaired immune systems. Two of the most important microbes in this category are the fungus Candida albicans and Gram-positive bacteria of the genus Enterococcus, which share overlapping niches in the oral cavity, gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. The clinical importance of oral C. albicans biofilm and its interaction with the host under immunosuppressive conditions remains largely understudied. Here, we used a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) with cortisone acetate injection on alternate days and a continuous supply of C. albicans in drinking water for three days, resulting in immunosuppression. Results showed abundant growth of resident oral bacteria and a strong C. albicans biofilm on the tongue consisting of hyphae which damaged papillae, the epidermal layer, and invaded tongue tissue with the accumulation of inflammatory cells as demonstrated by Grocott’s methenamine silver and hematoxylin and eosin staining, respectively. The dispersed microbes from the oral biofilm colonized the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and damaged its integrity, disseminating microbes to other organs. Although no visible damage was observed in the kidney and liver, except increased lipid vacuoles in the liver cells, C. albicans was found in the liver homogenate. Intriguingly, we found co-occurrence of Enterococcus faecalis in the tongue, liver, and stool of immunosuppressed control and C. albicans infected organs. Targeted 16S rRNA and ITS2 amplicon sequencing of microbes from the fecal samples of mice confirmed the above results in the stool samples and revealed an inverse correlation of beneficial microbes in the dysbiosis condition. Our study shows that mucosal-oral infection of C. albicans under immunosuppressed conditions causes tissue damage and invasion in local and distant organs; the invasion may be aided by the overgrowth of the resident endogenous Enterobacteriaceae and other members, including the opportunistic pathogen Enterococcus faecalis.

## Impact of HIV on HPV-related cancers in men who have sex with men: a review

date: 2025-01-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) significantly increases the incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and HPV-related cancers among men who have sex with men (MSM). Conversely, HPV infection can also influence HIV acquisition rates. HIV-induced immune suppression may affect chromosomal stability, gene expression, protein function and other molecular components in MSM with HPV-related cancers. Additionally, HIV infection also alters cellular mechanisms by compromising immune responses and epithelial integrity. In this review, we reviewed the influence of HIV on specific HPV-related cancers in MSM, including oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, penile cancer, and anal cancer. We integrated epidemiological data from the past five years and discussed diagnosis and treatment strategies. Overall, our review offers crucial insights into the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of these co-infection MSM patients. Our review aims to assist future research in developing effective treatment strategies for MSM with HIV/HPV co-infection.

## Population genetic analysis of clinical Mycobacterium abscessus complex strains in China

date: 2025-01-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundTo explore the genetic characteristics of the Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MABC) population in China, given its rising clinical importance among nontuberculous mycobacteria.MethodsWe conducted population genetic analyses on 360 MABC genomes from China, focusing on core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST), pan-genome characterization, population genetics, and antimicrobial resistance gene profiling.ResultsOur analysis identified 273 M. abscessus subsp. abscessus (MabA) and 87 M. abscessus subsp. massiliense (MabM) isolates, uncovering 68 sequence types (STs), with ST5 being the most common. cgMLST classified 33.3% of isolates into six dominant circulating clones (DCCs) and 49.4% into 59 genomic clusters at a threshold of 25 different alleles, including 18 international clusters linking Chinese isolates with seven other countries. The MABC pan-genome is open, with MabA exhibiting greater accessory gene diversity and higher gene turnover compared to MabM. Mobile genetic elements (MGEs), such as prophages and genomic islands, were prevalent across all genomes. 139 to 151 virulence factors (VFs) were identified per genome, with distinct accessory VFs in MabA and MabM affecting immune modulation and metabolism. Resistance gene profiling revealed ubiquitous mtrA, RbpA, and blaMAB, with MabA-specific erm(41) conferring resistance to macrolides and β-lactams. Common rrs and rrl gene mutations indicated widespread resistance to aminoglycosides and macrolides, while gyrA mutations suggested emerging fluoroquinolone resistance. An acquired erm(46) gene, likely obtained via phage-mediated horizontal gene transfer, was detected in one MabA strain.ConclusionThis study provides key genetic insights into the dynamics of MABC in China. The widespread distribution of DCCs, high genomic clustering rates, open pan-genome, and distinct resistance patterns between MabA and MabM, along with MGEs, highlight the need for targeted surveillance and tailored therapies to address emerging challenges in MABC infections.

## Identification of serotype O3b and high-risk clone ST37 of Klebsiella pneumoniae revealed by comparative genomic analysis

date: 2025-01-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

BackgroundEpidemiological risk factors such as the demography of a place, environment, food, livestock, and companion animals are known sources of Klebsiella pneumoniae infection. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has become a powerful tool to complement traditional microbiological characterization of foodborne pathogens. Moreover, K. pneumoniae has several species complexes (KpSC) and is very difficult to differentiate using routine microbiological methods. The present study aims to investigate the prevalence of K. pneumoniae in fish available in the retail market using WGS.MethodsIsolation of K. pneumoniae, identification of K. pneumoniae isolates, and determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were performed. Whole-genome sequencing of K. pneumoniae genomes and phylogenomic analysis were conducted for visual comparison of the genomes. Furthermore, genomes of non-human origin that were submitted from India to the NCBI database were downloaded and included in the comparative analysis.ResultsThe findings showed that many antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) are prominent, including acrD, BaeR, cpxA, mdtB, mdtC, CRP, H-NS, KpnE, KpnF, KpnG, KpnH, acrA, acrB, marA, ramB, oqxA, oqxB, LptD, and emrR. Four fish-sourced isolates had different blaSHV resistance gene variants. The presence of ARGs for aminoglycosides [aac(3)-IId], fluoroquinolones (oqxA, oqxB), and fosfomycin (fosA5, fosA6) in these K. pneumoniae isolates from fish sources was found. One of the CIFT-K6 isolates had the uncommon serotype of K. pneumoniae O3b with the high-risk clone “ST37.” The ST515 sequence type was present in two K. pneumoniae isolates (CIFT-K7 and CIFT-K8), but the O3b serotype and ST192 allele type were present in the CIFT-K10 isolate.ConclusionTo the best of our knowledge, this research study represents the first Indian report of K. pneumoniae linked to fish, specifically the high-risk clone ‘ST37’ and two other STs, 515 and 192. The most common plasmid type detected in all four isolates was IncFIB, and 75% of the isolates were IncFII and IncHI1B. The prevalence of ARGs linked to efflux pump resistance mechanisms is highlighted by the analysis of genome sequence data.

## The histone methyltransferase DOT1B is dispensable for stage differentiation and macrophage infection of Leishmania mexicana

date: 2025-01-20, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology

Conserved histone methyltransferases of the DOT1 family are involved in replication regulation, cell cycle progression, stage differentiation, and gene regulation in trypanosomatids. However, the specific functions of these enzymes depend on the host evasion strategies of the parasites. In this study, we investigated the role of DOT1B in Leishmania mexicana, focusing on life cycle progression and infectivity. In contrast to Trypanosoma brucei, in which DOT1B is essential for the differentiation of mammal-infective bloodstream forms to insect procyclic forms, L. mexicana DOT1B (LmxDOT1B) is not critical for the differentiation of promastigotes to amastigotes in vitro. Additionally, there are no significant differences in the ability to infect or differentiate in macrophages or sand fly vectors between the LmxDOT1B-depleted and control strains. These findings highlight the divergence of the function of DOT1B in these related parasites, suggesting genus-specific adaptations in the use of histone modifications for life cycle progression and host adaptation processes.
