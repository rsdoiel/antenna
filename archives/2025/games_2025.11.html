Half-Life 2 RTX demo is now available</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-18, updated: 2025-03-18, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>At GDC 2025, Nvidia shared a progress update on the Half-Life 2 RTX
mod, and part of that was an announcement that a free demo of the
visually-overhauled title was coming on March 18. That day has arrived,
so owners of Half-Life 2 on Steam can snag the free demo. The
in-progress mod overhauls the […]</p>

Pokémon Go?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-18, updated: 2025-03-18, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>Shellder, the water-type bivalve Pokémon from Kanto, can be found in
the wild in Pokémon Go. Yes, Shellder can be shiny in Pokémon Go!
Cloyster doesn’t see much use in raids, as there’s many ice- and
water-type Pokémon that do significantly more damage than it. However,
Cloyster does see some usage in Ultra League PvP […]</p>

<p>At Polygon, we want to introduce you to at least one thing we think
you’d love every single day. With so many games, movies, shows, and
internet-based quick bites (or “quibis”) out there to experience, we

untested, dive into the unknown. […]</p>

<p>Sunrise on the Reaping, the highly-anticipated Hunger Games prequel
book, comes out tomorrow. It’ll tell the story of the Second Quarter
Quell, the Hunger Games that Katniss’s gruff mentor Haymitch won.

<p>In the latest issue of Weekly Famitsu, a poll lists Pragmata as the
magazine readership’s third most wanted game despite its indefinite
delay almost two years ago. Pragmata received 466 votes, pushing it past
big names like Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, Pokémon Legends:

<p>Announced at The Mix + Kinda FunnySpring Game Showcase Monday, Atari
is bringing back ’80s arcade defense game Missile Command. Titled
Missile Command Delta, the new game comes from from 13AM Games and
Mighty Yell and looks to be a more elaborate reimagining than we’re used
to from Atari’s revivals. This isn’t the first time […]</p>

<p>date: 2025-03-17, updated: 2025-03-17, from: Polygon Website</p>
<p>It’s been more than eight years since we were first introduced to the
Nintendo Switch. What was once seen as a bold new concept and a
reinvention of Nintendo’s console business — a move that initially
spooked investors — now feels pretty normal. Widespread adoption
certainly helped. Since 2017, Nintendo has sold a staggering 150 million
Switch […]</p>

<p>This week the big news is, of course, the Severance finale. After
really popping off this season and giving us more intrigue than ever,
we’re finally nearing the completion of the Cold Harbor file and god,
who knows what they’re going to do to Gemma (Dichen Lachman)? I’m on the
edge of my seat, and […]</p>

<p>It’s a strange time to be reviewing an Nvidia graphics card. The
company sent me a GeForce RTX 5080 a month and a half ago, and in that
time, I’ve played a lot of games and watched a lot of GPU benchmark
comparison videos. But also in that time, Nvidia’s longtime competitor
AMD (which has […]</p>

<p>After seeing Kraven the Hunter in theaters in December 2024, I
couldn’t stop thinking about one detail of the movie. Kraven’s arrival
on Netflix this week — its debut for the streaming audience — brought it
back to the forefront of my mind. Kraven was a huge box-office flop,
scoring around $60 million worldwide on a […]</p>

<p>It’s nice to be cozy. I’m a huge fan of being wrapped up in a big
blanket, sipping hot chocolate, and leisurely walks under colorful
autumn trees. Cozy games are also great, and they’re an increasingly
popular genre. While I’ve spent hours preparing the perfect farm in
Stardew Valley or exploring Bahari Bay in Palia, […]</p>
