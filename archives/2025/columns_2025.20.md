## ★ More Insight and Not-Negativity

date: 2025-05-19, updated: 2025-05-19, from: Daring Fireball

I never linked to the viral blog post where Jobs was quoted recommending my article, I never mentioned it in a post, but I *did* acknowledge it, in what is clearly the most Daring-Fireball-ish way possible: I made it the slogan under the logo banner.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-05-19, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I was going to use <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/ffea3997c193552deb8fc8c864e8ebee">this code</a> in the UI of my search engine, when it wanted to display an image over http, reroute it to use an https proxy server. But Chrome wouldn't stay out of the way, so had to give up. Hey I was trying to route around their outage.

Apparently Chrome has changed the behavior of images served over http in web pages. It's changing the request to https, so it gives an erroneous error message about the certificate which the page never claimed to have.

## The Real Cost of Chinese Open-Source AI

date: 2025-05-19, from: Om Malik blog

Don&#8217;t believe the Chinese AI open-source hype, warns good friend, Pete Warden. Their large language models come at a price — the models are programmed to deliberately obscure historical truths, he writes on his blog. He points out that this isn&#8217;t just censorship; it&#8217;s engineered misinformation at scale, baked into the foundation of future AI. Warden compares answers to the same query using different models to support his conclusions.

And with <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/misc/database">this update</a>, we don't depend on OPML any longer to create the database, all the data is exported in a format that can be easily imported directly into an SQL database. I provide the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/misc/database#the-sql-table">schema</a> and example <a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog/misc/database#code-to-import">JavaScript code</a> that, via SQL, updates a database.

I've been working on the search function for this blog, and now we have all the DaveNet pieces between 1994 and 2004 in the database. So here's a search for <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22menu%20sharing%22">menu sharing</a> which was a technology we made on the Mac that allowed people to write menus of scripts in Frontier that appear inside other apps. Netscape supported it as did MSIE, Quark, Eudora and many others. It was kind of magical, esp when the apps themselves were scriptable (many of them were in the 90s). Next up, I'm going to import the home page of Scripting News from 1997 to 2010. It was mostly a linkblog then.

## The NSA’s “Fifty Years of Mathematical Cryptanalysis (1937–1987)”

date: 2025-05-19, updated: 2025-05-19, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>In response to a FOIA request, the NSA released &#8220;<a href="https://www.governmentattic.org/58docs/NSA50YrsMathCrypt1988.pdf">Fifty Years of Mathematical Cryptanalysis (1937-1987)</a>,&#8221; by Glenn F. Stahly, with a lot of redactions.</p>
<p>Weirdly, this is the second time the NSA has declassified the document. John Young got a <a href="https://archive.org/details/NSAFiftyYearsOfMathematicalCryptanalyisis">copy</a> in 2019. This one has a few less redactions. And nothing that was provided in 2019 was redacted here.</p>
<p>If you find anything interesting in the document, please tell us about it in the comments.</p>

## Scrape wars

date: 2025-05-19, from: Paolo Valdemarin's blog

There’s a lot of scraping going on these days. It looks like most AI applications that need to access content online are resorting to scraping web pages. Many AI agents we’ve been working on rely on having some sort of access to online content. Of course, we started with a simple RSS aggregator: it’s clean, &#8230; <a href="https://val.demar.in/2025/05/scrape-wars/" class="more-link">Continue reading<span class="screen-reader-text"> "Scrape wars"</span></a>

## How iPhone has evolved as a Camera

date: 2025-05-19, from: Om Malik blog

Given how much I have been using my iPhone as my everyday camera, I decided to put together this blog post to show how far Apple&#8217;s smartphone camera technology has come. With WWDC 2025 coming up later this summer, I am interested in how much more Apple and its chip-wizards can cram into my daily &#8230;

Tonight, late on a Sunday night, the House Budget Committee passed what Republicans are calling their &#8220;Big, Beautiful Bill&#8221; to enact Trump&#8217;s agenda although it had failed on Friday when far-right Republicans voted against it, complaining it did not make deep enough cuts to social programs.

I don't know any Celtics fans, but I imagine there are some subscribers who are. Hard to imagine how hard the last series hit you all. I don't have anything against the Celtics these days although Paul Pierce is an asshole, and I hope you all know that. Just watched the OKC win over Denver. All around an incredible group in the final four, very diverse and inclusive. And btw now that I think of it, Jaylen Brown was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSu9DYgvn1E">grabbing</a> Knicks players by the balls. I hope you all come to terms with that. We do love Kristaps in New York, a true gentleman. Maybe he and Giannis can come play for the Nets. We may have room for another great team in NY.
