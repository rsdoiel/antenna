## Pete Rose

date: 2025-05-25, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>It was so predictable. Shortly after Pete Rose died, baseball <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/article/calls-escalate-against-rob-manfred-220702792.html">rescinded his lifetime ban</a>, and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=May+13%2C+2025%2C+Manfred+instituted+a+change">now he can</a> be <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=pete+rose+hall+of+fame+induction">inducted</a> into the Hall of Fame. </p>
<p>He had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Rose#Records_and_achievements">more hits</a> than any baseball player ever. </p>
<p>A role model in so many ways, and like all heroes he had fatal flaws. You may think he set a bad example for kids, but I say the opposite. You don't give kids enough credit. What he taught was that a man with average athletic ability could will himself to achieve. </p>
<p>I grew up with a Pete Rose ethos, why shouldn't I go for it all? I feel so sad that he couldn't have gotten the acceptance he so totally deserved. How could we not forgive him? He was Charlie Hustle! <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">‚ù§Ô∏è</span></p>

## 2025-05-25 iPhone, GoPro, tears

date: 2025-05-25, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-05-25-iphone-gopro-tears">2025-05-25 iPhone, GoPro, tears</h1>

<p>I have a GoPro which I used to take a nice <a href="/wiki/2024-04-06-maledives-14.mov">6s video of a young whale</a> when we went to the <a href="2024-04-06-maledives">Maledives in 2024</a>.</p>

<p>I also took hours of not so important video. There is, of course, an iPhone app for the GoPro. It currently has 45 GB of videos on it. I can&rsquo;t access the iPhone from my wife&rsquo;s Mac without upgrading it.</p>

<p>So I use my Linux Laptop to connect to the phone. And my wife&rsquo;s Mac is mounted via wifi, and it has the external hard disk where the videos should go. Current transfer speed is 1.3 MB/sec.</p>

<p>Sometimes I do feel the bars of the golden cage. üòî</p>

<p>And there so many random errors. Or a laptop that falls asleep. Or a duplicate filename. These things always interrupt the process and wait for user input.</p>

<p>This is where the tears come in.</p>

On Thursday the Trump administration told Harvard University that because it had not handed over information on foreign students&#8217; protest activities, violent activity, and coursework, the university had &#8220;lost [the] privilege&#8221; of enrolling foreign students.

Really enjoying the NBA playoffs, even though the Knicks are still in it. Nice turnaround after the first quarter for the Minnesotas. Still hoping for a finals between them and the Knicks. It'll be interesting to see how the Knicks change their lineup. Hopefully no more isolation-ball with Brunson. It's boring and doesn't work. Melo 2.0. Might make sense if he was LeBron, but he's not and LeBron's game is boring anyway. Let's do this well, win or lose.

## 2025-05-19 Split

date: 2025-05-23, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-05-19-split">2025-05-19 Split</h1>

<p>We drove all the way to Split, visited the old town and what remains of Diocletians palace, had lunch and then we went walking through Marjan forest park. Wonderfully quiet.</p>

<p>On the way to the city center, I spotted a passion flower. So beautiful.
They look like cosmic spaceships or psychedelic temples in miniature.</p>

<p>Blaue Passionsblume<br>
Passiflora caerulea</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-1.jpg" alt="a flower with an complex, three-dimensional structure in the middle" /></p>

<p>The marina in front of the old town.
Half the old town is with the perimeter of Diocletian&rsquo;s palace.</p>

<p>The water is dirty and smells bad.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-2.jpg" alt="a marina with small boats and a boulevard with palm trees" /></p>

<p>They turned Diocletian&rsquo;s mausoleum into the cathedral.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-3.jpg" alt="Claudia near the bell tower of the cathedral, with tourists in the back" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-4.jpg" alt="looking up a the bell tower" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-5.jpg" alt="from a nearby ruin with an open cupola, the bell tower can still be seen" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-6.jpg" alt="Split&rsquo;s old town is full of narrow alleys" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-7.jpg" alt="there is an open pit where you can see into the cellar ruins of Diocletian&rsquo;s palace" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-8.jpg" alt="looking back at the bell tower" /></p>

<p>There are places where you can see two levels of cellars and three or four levels of buildings.
This how I like my dungeon ruins. üòÑ</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-9.jpg" alt="looking into another pit with access to underground levels" /></p>

<p>What impressed me the most is that people live in the midst of these fantastic ruins.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-10.jpg" alt="extremely narrow alleys" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-11.jpg" alt="and suddenly, a private garden" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-12.jpg" alt="and ruins, and tourists" /></p>

<p>We went into the cathedral.
It&rsquo;s a small octagonal building because it used to be Diocletions tomb.
I was not impressed.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-13.jpg" alt="looking up at the ceiling" /></p>

<p>Looking back over the corner with the carden (to the left) and the low walls from where one could peek into the cellars.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-14.jpg" alt="a view of Diocletian&rsquo;s palace with tourist milling about" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-15.jpg" alt="ruins of walls with niches" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-16.jpg" alt="more narrow alleys" /></p>

<p>We had enough after a while, had a small lunch and decided to head into the Marjan forest park.
The stairs up start in the old town.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-17.jpg" alt="Claudia on marble stairs" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-18.jpg" alt="looking at Split&rsquo;s old town from the stairs" /></p>

<p>Barbary fig<br>
Opuntia ficus-indica</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-19.jpg" alt="a yellow flower on a cactus" /></p>

<p>Stechendes Sternauge<br>
Pallenis spinosa</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-20.jpg" alt="yellow flowers and spiny leaves" /></p>

<p>Dry stone walls everywhere. Later there was even an info board talking about dry stone wall building.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-21.jpg" alt="some tall corniferous trees behind a dry stone wall" /></p>

<p>The trail from the end of the stairs to Sedlow is wide, flat, and beautiful.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-22.jpg" alt="Claudia on a nice walkway" /></p>

<p>Johannisbrotbaum<br>
Ceratonia siliqua</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-23.jpg" alt="thick, saussage-like beans hanging on a tree" /></p>

<p>The nice walkway turns into a trail.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-24.jpg" alt="a trail along a dry wall with trees off to the side providing no shade" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-25.jpg" alt="the trail continues and still the trees provide no shade" /></p>

<p>The trail gets narrower and we start thinking of ticks again.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-26.jpg" alt="a singletrail with grass and bushes growing nearby; some sort of info panel in the distance" /></p>

<p>Damaszener Schwarzk√ºmmel<br>
Nigella damascena</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-27.jpg" alt="a blue flower with a complex network of antenna-like protrusions" /></p>

<p>A view of a hidden sandy (?) beach.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-28.jpg" alt="trees in the foreground and the sea in the back" /></p>

<p>We walked back along the coast and looked up. Our trail was somewhere behind this cliff.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-29.jpg" alt="a forested hill and while cliffs at the top" /></p>

<p>In the evening we went for pizza and pasta.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-30.jpg" alt="a marina by night" /></p>

## What‚Äôs Half of Nothing?

date: 2025-05-23, from: Om Malik blog

Camera reviews are not only pointless, but are also kind of rigged. And there is no better testimonial for this camera hype machine than the ‚Äúreview‚Äù of Fuji X half camera by PetaPixel. Fuji X half camera is a camera that has vertical optical viewfinder and a vertical rear LCD. It has an 18-megapixel one-inch &#8230;

## Friday Squid Blogging: US Naval Ship Attacked by Squid in 1978

date: 2025-05-23, updated: 2025-05-12, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Interesting <a href="https://www.oldsaltblog.com/2025/05/when-the-frigate-uss-stein-was-attacked-by-a-colossal-squid-2/">story</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>USS Stein</em> was underway when her anti-submarine sonar gear suddenly stopped working. On returning to port and putting the ship in a drydock, engineers observed many deep scratches in the sonar dome&#8217;s rubber &#8220;NOFOUL&#8221; coating. In some areas, the coating was described as being shredded, with rips up to four feet long. Large claws were left embedded at the bottom of most of the scratches.</p></blockquote>
<p>As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven&#8217;t covered.</p>

I would pay extra for cable service to have none of my money go to Fox News.

If you're into Mastodon,  you can follow my <a href="https://daveverse.org/">daveverse</a> blog, the one I write using <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>, on Mastodon, using this address: @scripting@daveverse.org. Mastodon preserves links and styling, and doesn't seem to have a size limit. I can edit my posts and you get the updates. So Mastodon kind of informally has become a blogging system, which I totally applaud. It checks a lot of the boxes from my <a href="https://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a> manifesto. Slowly the world is starting to make sense.

A couple of little tweaks to <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=Hello World">Daytona</a>. It now has a <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/23/historyMenuDaytona.png">history menu</a> which it saves in local storage. It's useful to be able to come back to a recent search. It remembers the last 50 searches this way. Also had to add a little hack that turns off other copies of Daytona when another one launches. Use a local storage trick, save a random string to a fixed location, and every second check to see if its value has changed. If it has, another copy of Daytona has launched, so I redirect to the home page of my blog.

If the Trumps keep making demands, like demanding that they stop admitting students from outside the US, the students the US government rejects could still go to Harvard, be taught by the same teachers, collaborate and socialize with other Harvard-quality students, without interference from Trump. I imagine there are a few countries that would be willing to help. If you want to really make a point, open it in China.

If we continue treating privacy as a product to be bought rather than a right
to be protected, we risk creating an internet where only the wealthy can
afford to be free.

<h1 id="2025-05-22-postira">2025-05-22 Postira</h1>

<p>We went for a walk along the coast to Lovreƒçina. All the bars and restaurants were closed but the flowers were in bloom. It‚Äôs May! üòç</p>

## 2025-05-21 Postira, Bol

date: 2025-05-22, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-05-21-postira-bol">2025-05-21 Postira, Bol</h1>

<p>We knew it was going to rain. We went for a short walk through Postira and then we had the fantastic idea of driving to the other side of the island, hoping to find the other side sunny. And so it was! At first, though, we drove in the pouring rain. It was only the last few kilometres that we started seeing the sun. We went for a short run and managed to take a bath at the Golden Horn, purportedly the ‚Äúmost beautiful beach‚Äù of Croatia. Significantly overhyped, for sure. At least during the off season it is mostly empty. üòç</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-21-postira-bol-1.jpg" alt="Claudia taking a picture of the clouds" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-21-postira-bol-2.jpg" alt="narrow alleys" />

<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-21-postira-bol-6.jpg" alt="some houses are dry stone walls and wilderness, a roof near collapse and boarded up windows" /></p>

<p>We walked up until we could look into the Dol valley towards the center of the island. Rain clouds loomed.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-21-postira-bol-7.jpg" alt="a road leading into a valley with grey clouds overhead" /></p>

<p>We drove through the rain (no pictures) and finally arrived on the sunny side. There, we posed like the influencers we are.</p>

<p>We also went for a swim.</p>

<p>The Golden Horn is probably famouse because it is a tip of pebble beach reaching into the sea. A beach on both sides!</p>

<p>Not shown: all the empty stands and bars awaiting the main season.</p>

And the game seemed so won. When Brunson sat down in the fourth period because he was in foul trouble, the Knicks had a huge run that put them up by 17 with less than 3 minutes remaining. My numbers might be slightly off. Then they brought Brunson back, and it all flipped around. The Pacers were getting off shots where they weren't before, and their aim was deadly. So it wasn't just the Knicks folding, the Pacers were hot. The announcers were so clueless, the Knicks didn't need Brunson back. He was benched a good portion of the final blowout with Boston. I loved that. Showed he can sit down when needed, and the team will keep going. When he was injured in March, the Knicks faltered at first, but then they learned how to put it together with the remaining players which believe it or not are a full NBA team, a very competitive one. So when Brunson gets in foul trouble and the remaining Knicks are in a groove don't screw with it. That should be the lesson of last night's game. The Knicks were very good, net-net, but the Pacers were better and they won.

## The Voter Experience

date: 2025-05-22, updated: 2025-05-21, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Technology and innovation have transformed every part of society, including our electoral experiences. Campaigns are spending and doing more than at any other time in history. Ever-growing war chests fuel billions of voter contacts every cycle. Campaigns now have better ways of scaling outreach methods and offer volunteers and donors more efficient ways to contribute time and money. Campaign staff have adapted to vast changes in media and social media landscapes, and use data analytics to forecast voter turnout and behavior.</p>
<p>Yet despite these unprecedented investments in mobilizing voters, overall trust in electoral health, democratic institutions, voter satisfaction, and electoral engagement has significantly declined. What might we be missing?...</p>

## 2025-05-22 The audio stack

date: 2025-05-22, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-05-22-the-audio-stack">2025-05-22 The audio stack</h1>

<p>Whenever I think about audio on my Debian-based laptops, I feel like I‚Äôm just too old for this. I just don‚Äôt get it anymore. Then I read a blog post like this one and I shake my head because I guess I‚Äôm not too old ‚Äì the situation truly is miserable!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now the audio stack kicks in. Is it PipeWire? PulseAudio? Is ALSA enabled? Is the correct fallback sink selected? Is the audio device owned by root? Is the socket exposed to your session? Who knows. ‚Äì <a href="https://fireborn.mataroa.blog/blog/i-want-to-love-linux-it-doesnt-love-me-back-post-1-built-for-control-but-not-for-people/">I Want to Love Linux. It Doesn‚Äôt Love Me Back: Post 1 ‚Äì Built for Control, But Not for People</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Accessibility matters. The problems blind users encounter are the problems that sighted people like me will encounter later in life. And when the complaints are about complexity, brittleness, lack of testing and lack of backwards compatibility, you know that eventually you‚Äôll get hit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A stack implies layers. Order. A single interface at each point. This is not a stack.‚Ä®This is a tangled mess of everything ever built for Linux audio still being required right now because no one can kill anything off without breaking something else. You want to play sound? You need: ALSA, because it‚Äôs the actual driver. PipeWire, because it‚Äôs the new standard. Pulse emulation, because most apps still use Pulse. ALSA plugins, because some things bypass PipeWire. JACK shims, because a few pro audio tools never moved on. And config files for all of it‚Äîif they even exist. This isn‚Äôt backwards compatibility.‚Ä® This is a graveyard, and we‚Äôre all just camping in it. ‚Äì <a href="https://fireborn.mataroa.blog/blog/i-want-to-love-linux-it-doesnt-love-me-back-post-1-built-for-control-but-not-for-people/">I Want to Love Linux. It Doesn‚Äôt Love Me Back: Post 1 ‚Äì Built for Control, But Not for People</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wonder. Isn‚Äôt this stack the right thing to do? The new layer with an emulation of the old layer sitting atop the kernel layer, etc? In the long lived stacks in the commercial world, the same thing is true (Windows API, Java API ‚Äì all continue to offer compatibility layers to deprecated things). From my perspective the main problem is that the mess is necessary but it must also be either strictly encapsulated and controlled or ‚Äì if composable like in a typical Linux distribution ‚Äì supported by tools to inspect and control it across all layers. What we have right now is a composable stack where we are free to install and deinstall parts and every layer provides independent inspection and control tools that work differently from each other. And no overview so you don‚Äôt know which part is failing.</p>

<p>My audio stacks also mostly work but if the volume is wrong I always wonder: what tool do I need to run (on the command line) to change it. So many mixers! And on every new laptop: do I need Jack? And is PipeWire or PulseAudio the correct one? Or both? The uncertainty is part of my problem.</p>

## Vibe Check ‚Ññ38

date: 2025-05-22, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>It‚Äôs been an eventful three months since my last update. I nearly burnt myself out powering through a big internal release at work in February, a season of back-to-back family activities March and April, I turned 45 at the end of April and school lets out next week. Summer has begun.</p>
<p>And let‚Äôs be honest, we could blame the tardiness of this post on a lot of issues: the rise of fascist authoritarianism in America, busy home life, busy career, nights at the ball field‚Ä¶ But we all know the real reason this post is months overdue: Balatro.</p>
<h2>Internal-source work project launched</h2>
<p>I devoted a lot of my Q1 life force to getting an internal work project out the door. It‚Äôs an internal design system that‚Äôs a sibling of the open source design system I work on but has more components, smaller API surface, a different look, more expressive and robust token system, and it‚Äôs less kilobytes.</p>
<p>Our team has a lot to be proud of and built something great but I‚Äôm learning that it‚Äôs not always a straightforward process in large companies. We‚Äôre addressing feedback and iterating to make it better while more requirements trickle in. It‚Äôll jeremy-beremy around a bit until we get the five moons to align.</p>
<h2>Cheer competitions</h2>
<p>Spring is competitive cheer seasons. My daughter finished her second year of competitive cheer competitions. Not without drama. In late February her team competed at the NCA Cheerleading Competition and won the national championship for her D2 Mini Level 2 division. A minute after hearing the news <a href="https://www.kcentv.com/article/news/local/downtown-dallas-texas-nca-cheerleader-competition-incident/287-5e8610ef-5b74-425e-b02f-da3d0f8f165a">there was an active shooter situation</a> which was traumatizing even though it turned out to be two groups of parents fighting at a hotel. Wholly unnecessary. Everyone‚Äôs safe, but it‚Äôs having ripple effects through our family unit and friends‚Äô families as well.</p>
<p>Since that event we‚Äôve decided to go to competitions as a family. We went to one in Houston (technically, Rosenberg) which we parlayed into a trip to see my mom. The cheer season culminated in the Regional Finals competition in New Orleans, Louisiana (see below).</p>
<h2>Installed grass and irrigation</h2>
<p>Back-to-back heat death summers, our front lawn has been a barren disaster. In the summer the city limits days you can water, I‚Äôm inconsistent at watering, grass got too hot, curled up and died. And I don‚Äôt love spending my Wednesday and Saturday mornings and evenings moving sprinklers around, getting bit by mosquitos, and realizing I left hoses on in the middle of the night (see: ADHD). I even own a special flat shovel that I use to scrape mud back into our yard after it rains.</p>
<p>One of our lawn guys approached us with a plan to add irrigation and re-sod the front yard for an affordable price so we jumped on it. But did it work? It sure did. I‚Äôm happy to report we‚Äôre no longer the dirt bags in the neighborhood‚Ä¶ for now. At least five neighbors have mentioned our yard (and former dirt patch) to me.</p>
<h2>Spring break in Arizona</h2>
<p>While most families head to the beach, we went to the desert. Arizona offers us one amenity not available in coastal regions: cousins! For five packed days our kids went wild playing with their cousins. To be honest, being off-duty as a parent with kids fully entertained and redundant parent figures (grandparents, aunts, and uncles) is the most relaxing and restorative break for me.</p>
<p>While we spent most of our time with family, we managed to sneak out and see a pre-season baseball game which was nice. The slow pace of life at the ballpark is a worthy aspiration to strive for.</p>
<h2>The Sherwood Forest Renaissance Faire</h2>
<p>Our friends the Kentopps invited us to join them at the Renaissance Faire. They have two boys and have gone for the past couple years and our weekends aligned where we could say ‚ÄúAye,‚Äù to ye olde adventure.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/renfaire.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>There‚Äôs something magical about the Renaissance Faire, and I‚Äôm not talking strictly about all the cleavage and robed wizard cosplayers. It‚Äôs a fully immersive environment on acres of land. People in costume speaking with faux-Arthurian high fantasy accents as far as the eye can see. Shops of all different sizes and caliber selling different handmade and laser-cut wares. The illusion achieves a critical mass, and offers you a gift to suspend your disbelief and enjoy the group improvisation.</p>
<p>I did find it ironic that I‚Äôm the biggest nerd in my family, I play DnD, but I don‚Äôt have a RenFaire costume. After much discussion I think I realized that I‚Äôm not that kind of dork. I‚Äôm a different kind of dork.</p>
<h2>New Orleans</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/nola-gator.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>At the beginning of April my daughter had her Regional Finals cheer competition in New Orleans. We stayed off-French Quarter near the convention center but we dipped in and out as needed. There were a three major highlights of this trip for me:</p>
<ol>
<li>My daughter‚Äôs team finishing their season undefeated</li>
<li><a href="https://www.honeyislandswamp.com/">The Honey Island Swamp Tour</a></li>
<li>Spending lots of time in City Park</li>
</ol>
<p>We had a great guide on our swamp tour which made it that much more enjoyable. We saw lots of small swamp critters, tons of birds, and the big finale was two 12-foot female gators up close to our boat. Good memories for sure.</p>
<p>We ended up at City Park two or three times over our three day trip. The sculpture garden was phenomenal. There‚Äôs an amusement park there too. And can‚Äôt forget the Caf√© Du Monde (of course) where you can coat your entire body in powdered sugar for your beignets. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs more to the story of City Park, but I love when cities invest in enormous public spaces. It‚Äôs a great contrast and relief to the more intense (and drunk) economic zones.</p>
<p>For Texans (and all Americans?), New Orleans is the closest city you can go that feels like another country. It has a different bustle, a different energy, different food, and that was fun to show the kids.</p>
<h2>Bought another car</h2>
<p>One Wednesday night my wife said ‚ÄúI think we need to buy a new car.‚Äù Part pressure due to family visiting us with no way to haul everyone around, part tariff-induced panic; buying a car became a top family priority. A quick search showed a nearby dealership had the right color (the most important feature of a car) and trim (the one with the black grill and wheels) that my wife wanted.</p>
<p>While this seems impulsive (and believe me, yes, correct) this is how our family operates. We talk about something for years, bucket money, never act, and then full send it on a whim.</p>
<p>At 5pm, she left me with the kids to go scope it out and about an hour later she called and told me to come to the dealership because we were ready to sign papers. Car financing is something that makes me want to pay cash for every car. 6pm turned into 7pm and so on‚Ä¶ but by 10pm we were leaving with a brand new car.</p>
<h2>Turning 45</h2>
<p>I aged again this year. Did you know aging isn‚Äôt linear? This is something I learned this year. You age a lot around 44 and then again at 60. Interesting huh? I think I‚Äôve been feeling that this past year. Aches are achier, all that.</p>
<p>I generally <em>feel</em> young, youth-spirited, but on the morning of my 45th I started to see 50 on the horizon and for the first time in my life I think I started to feel old. As I was thinking that my neighbor Cleo texted me to say happy birthday and congratulated me that I was now half her age. That was great timing. A reminder that there‚Äôs still a lot of life yet to live. That said, Cleo is super-fit and can still probably outrun me in a foot race, so who knows. You‚Äôre not guaranteed much on this earth.</p>
<h2>One year at Microsoft</h2>
<p>I also celebrated one full year at Microsoft. As I said above I‚Äôve gotten to work on some cool projects; not one but two design systems, a robust design token system, a couple prototypes, and a lot of documentation. I‚Äôve learned a lot and made some good work comrades.</p>
<p>A sour note to this celebration is that last week Microsoft had a 3% reduction in force (which is about 6,000) people. I know enough about enterprise to know this happens periodically but it never seems fair, only callous. I‚Äôm a post-processor so I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be sitting with this for awhile.</p>
<h2>Quick Stats</h2>
<h3>üß† Learning</h3>
<p>I love when I get to take a weekend for myself (read: I‚Äôm on parenting duty and the kids are on iPads) to learn something new.</p>
<ul>
<li>Godot - I took a weekend and Hello World‚Äôd Godot game engine. I have video game ideas kicking around but with Unity being the game engine I know, I felt like I was experiencing skill collapse because that company has made some horrific decisions. There‚Äôs a lot to like about Godot. GDScript feels like a cross between Python and JavaScript so it‚Äôs easy to pick up. It‚Äôs simplified in a way that you‚Äôre not forced to think about Quaternions right way, that‚Äôs there but more or less abstracted out. Feels like a good fit for a casual like myself.</li>
</ul>
<h3>üìñ Reading</h3>
<p>Not my best season of book consumption but that‚Äôs countered by the fact that 1) I chopped my RSS down from 3000 to 1200 unreads and 2) I read some great, high quality books.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3YEqwTD">The Siren‚Äôs Call</a> - Probably the best book I‚Äôve consumed in awhile. Digs into the heart of the Attention Economy and how our attention is valuable, monetized, and exploited.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4jCvpon">The Twilight of the Elites</a> - Another banger. A look at the 1% and how perverse and outsized the oligarchy‚Äôs role is in our politics. Meritocracy is not based on merit, but rather wealth.</li>

<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4iU0xPs">Meditations for Mortals</a> - Listening to this as an audiobook at 2x is not how the author intended but I still enjoyed it. I‚Äôll probably buy a paper copy and do the daily reflections.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81338328">Love on the Spectrum</a> - Autistic folks finding love. It‚Äôs a sweet show with so much emotional honesty. There‚Äôs a lot of making out, but it‚Äôs been great to watch the non-make-out parts with the kids and try to field their questions best I can on what makes autistic people unique.

<li>Duel Blitz Gundam - A mobile suit that has another set armor it can wear</li>
</ul>
<h3>üëæ Gaming</h3>
<p>I rebuilt my gaming PC so I could hop on games with my friends more. Been fun.</p>
<ul>
<li>Balatro - Way too much. Still having fun tho. Best way to kill 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Warzone - Back in Verdansk with the boys.</li>
<li>Overwatch - New stadium mode is okay. Anything different is welcome.</li>
<li>Lots of mini web games: <a href="https://368chickens.com/">368 chickens</a>, <a href="https://danielben.itch.io/dragonsweeper">Dragonsweeper</a>, etc.</li>

## Filings

date: 2025-05-21, from: Doc Searls (at Harvard), New Old Blog

Throwing blogs on the fire. I was thinking about posts as files, blogs as outlines, and outlines as directories. In geek-speak, directories look like this: something/something/something/something/file. In URLs, each something is also called a folder, because that&#39;s the frame in which putting files somewhere makes sense. Anyway, I have the top level of a directory [&#8230;]

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/05/21/theBeatles.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I mentioned Chris Lydon's <a href="http://scripting.com/2025/05/19.html#a222356">weblog for the ears</a> and got an email back, and this made me think some more. We need someone to do a canvas of how intellectuals use ChatGPT-like systems to advance their research and creativity, or just for learning or fun. It's the same kind of opportunity that was in front of us in 2003 when blogs were new, and only a few people loved the idea, but they were fierce in their enthusiasm. You could tell something was happening. It happened before that with PCs, and now it's happening again with AI. I'm absolutely sure of this, as sure as I was with PCs and the web. So Chris, humor me -- this is your new assignment -- find out from the people who listen to <a href="https://radioopensource.org/">Radio Open Source</a> not what's bad about AI, they hear that all the time, let's hear their stories, why they think it's the best thing ever. I believe you'll find them. That's what's missing today in journalism, and it's something Chris is uniquely able to do. BTW, here's a <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=ChatGPT">list of things</a> I've written recently about ChatGPT.

## More AIs Are Taking  Polls and Surveys

date: 2025-05-21, updated: 2025-05-21, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>I already knew about the declining response rate for polls and surveys. The percentage of AI bots that <a href="https://laurenleek.substack.com/p/the-quiet-collapse-of-surveys-fewer">respond to surveys</a> is also increasing.</p>
<p>Solutions are hard:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. <em>Make surveys less boring.</em><br />
We need to move past bland, grid-filled surveys and start designing experiences people actually want to complete. That means mobile-first layouts, shorter runtimes, and maybe even a dash of storytelling. TikTok or dating app style surveys wouldn&#8217;t be a bad idea or is that just me being too much Gen Z?</p>
<p>2. <em>Bot detection.</em><br />
There&#8217;s a growing toolkit of ways to spot AI-generated responses&#8212;using things like response entropy, writing style patterns or even metadata like keystroke timing. Platforms should start integrating these detection tools more widely. Ideally, you introduce an element that only humans can do, e.g., you have to pick up your price somewhere in-person. Btw, note that these bots can easily be designed to find ways around the most common detection tactics such as Captcha&#8217;s, timed responses and postcode and IP recognition. Believe me, way less code than you suspect is needed to do this...</p></blockquote>

## Moving from Notion to Obsidian

date: 2025-05-20, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>As the world turns, so doth productivity apps churn. Readers of this blog will know I‚Äôve been a user of Notion for the last seven-plus years. The block-based editor, the database features, and general ‚Äúwebbiness‚Äù of Notion suited me and let my inner productivity- and systems-wonk flourish.</p>
<p>Hearing rave reviews about Obsidian from friends (who are certainly not a cult, I‚Äôm told), I‚Äôve tried to switch twice before. I spent entire weekends setting up a trial vault but never felt compelled enough to switch fully. But today ‚Äìafter a slow month-long process‚Äì I‚Äôm happy to report I‚Äôve ditched Notion and am using Obsidian now. So‚Ä¶ what changed?</p>
<h2>My problems with Notion</h2>
<p>In March, Notion notified me that my monthly cost is increasing from $8/mo to $12/mo (a +50% increase). On top of that, Notion has been pushing AI hard the last couple years culminating in sparkle emojis everywhere and an ever-present animated floating mascot in the corner<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>. I poked around at the AI features, used my free credits, but came to the conclusion that AI inside Notion is almost the antithesis of what I want in Notion. I use Notion as a thinking tool, I don‚Äôt need it to be a think-for-me tool.</p>
<p>The emphasis on AI and the price hike forced me to scrutinize and re-think my commitment. Correct or not, I associated the two chafing points and felt like I was subsidizing other user‚Äôs AI usage rather than getting more value out of the app. That was the tipping point for me. I don‚Äôt harbor any hatred or disgust for Notion; it‚Äôs truly a ‚Äúwe‚Äôre growing in two different directions‚Äù sort of divorce.</p>
<p>Economically, Obsidian takes me in the opposite direction at $4/mo for Obsidian‚Äôs vault sync feature. It also takes me into a more bare bones, hands-on setup experience. That real farm-to-table organic content that forms the bedrock of my personal brand. üòÇ</p>
<h2>My new Obsidian setup</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/obsidian-graph-view-2.jpg" alt="screenshot of my obsidian setup showing a file tree on the left sidebar and a circular graph view of interconnected nodes in the main content area" /></p>
<p>I‚Äôve watched hours of videos about the perfect Obsidian setup but what truly unlocked it for me was Tyler Sticka‚Äôs post <em><a href="https://tylersticka.com/journal/obsidian-miscellany/">Obsidian Miscellany</a></em>. Seeing Tyler‚Äôs setup and the plugins he uses to craft Obsidian‚Äôs brutalist nature into something cozy gave me the courage to try a third time. Obsidian has a great plugin system and an active community of developers, where the WordPress-style ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a plugin for that‚Äù rings true (and probably has similar performance pitfalls). Getting a handful of plugins configured to your liking moves the user experience needle from ‚ÄúSomething I use‚Äù to ‚ÄúThis is mine‚Äù.</p>
<p>Copying most of Tyler‚Äôs list, here‚Äôs the list of plugins I‚Äôm using:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tgrosinger/advanced-tables-obsidian">Advanced Tables</a> - Make markdown tables draggable</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nekoshita/obsidian-auto-card-link">Auto Card Link</a> - Add unfurl-style link preview cards</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/ozntel/file-explorer-note-count">File Explorer Note Count</a> - Show file counts in the sidebar</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kelszo/obsidian-file-explorer-plus">File Explorer++</a> - Allows you to pin and hide items or folders (e.g. I‚Äôm hiding templates)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-hider">Hider</a> - Hide parts of the UI you don‚Äôt need/like</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/chetachiezikeuzor/Highlightr-Plugin">Highlightr</a> - Allows you to add highlighter effects to notes.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/FlorianWoelki/obsidian-iconize">Iconize</a> - Add icons to files and folders</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-importer">Importer</a> - Import items from other note-taking apps</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/platers/obsidian-linter">Linter</a> - Keep files tidy</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kevboh/longform">Longform</a> - A Scrivener-like tool for managing long form content (e.g. my shitty sci-fi stories)</li>
<li><a href="https://minimal.guide/home">Minimal Theme</a> - A Notion-like theme, but more minimal. Highly customizable.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal-settings">Minimal Theme Settings</a> - A UI to manage your Minimal Theme</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gtg922r/obsidian-numerals">Numerals</a> - A micro-spreadsheet that lets you do calculations</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/marcusolsson/obsidian-projects">Projects</a> - A folder-o-files powered kanban board</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings">Style Settings</a> - Override Obsidian styles</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pjeby/tag-wrangler">Tag Wrangler</a> - Normalize, dedupe, and merge tags</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/markahesketh/write-good-obsidian">Write Good</a> - A linter to help correct weasel words and remove passive voice, a poor man‚Äôs Grammarly</li>
</ul>
<p>These breakdown into three major categories of plugins: themes, editor, and process‚Ä¶ which is a great segue to talk about the organization and processes I have for my new vault.</p>
<h2>Inputs, Outputs, and Tasks</h2>
<p>For years <a href="https://daverupert.com/2022/04/productivity-sniped-by-para/">I‚Äôve been attempting to do PARA in Notion</a>, but I never found it a perfect match. ‚ÄúProjects have an end date‚Äù was revelatory and ‚ÄúAreas‚Äù helped me take inventory of my life, but pulling it all together and putting everything in the correct bucket felt like high ceremony. Moving to Obsidian gave me a chance to rethink how I wanted to organize my second brain.</p>
<p>By default, Obsidian nudges you towards no organization, which is to say it wants you to tag and link content to build wiki-like associations in a flat‚Äôish file structure. This doesn‚Äôt work for my brain at all. I need a bit of structure to my content. I spent a long time researching different organization systems from the loose (Zettelkasten) to the strict (Johnny Decimal) and I settled on a modification of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d93SGaf82OM">August Bradley‚Äôs Pipelines, Pillars and Vaults</a> that I call ‚ÄúInputs, Outputs, and Tasks.‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>Inputs</strong> are scraps of content and ideas that influence your thinking that you want to keep to reference later. I collect these ‚ÄúInputs‚Äù in small files organized in folders by content types like books, links, quotes, and unorganized notes.</p>
<p><strong>Outputs</strong> are a big part of why I use a note-taking app; to get ideas out of my head. Whereas Inputs are inert and fine to live in cold storage indefinitely, Outputs want to live in the world and need a little process behind them to maintain momentum. I‚Äôve recruited the help of some kanban and writing plugins to add a thin layer of process to my blog posts and projects.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks</strong> are the final leg of the stool and a tool for jumping back into finishing projects or other work. The one key thing about Tasks is that they‚Äôre <em>actionable</em> and <em>achievable</em>. Tasks can‚Äôt be big abstract to-dos like ‚ÄúDo taxes‚Äù or ‚ÄúMake a video game‚Äù, they have to be actionable like ‚ÄúGet 1099-R from SEP IRA‚Äù or ‚ÄúPrototype fog-of-war system.‚Äù Descriptive enough to be <em>actionable</em>, atomic enough to be <em>achievable</em>.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I don‚Äôt need a separate Tasks plugin to manage this, I can use the <code>[ ] Task Name</code> syntax in my project note and then use Dataview to slurp up a list of Tasks that I‚Äôve created across all my active projects.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>```dataview
TASK
FROM "Outputs"
WHERE !completed 
AND file.frontmatter.status != "DEADPOOL" 
AND file.frontmatter.status != "Archived"
GROUP BY file.name
```
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>You‚Äôd need to customize your <code>WHERE</code> clause to how you have your Obsidian setup, but that query generates a view like this where I group all to-dos by project or note.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/obsidian-tasks.jpg" alt="a todo list where a list of projects have one to three to-do items listed below" /></p>
<h2>Adding process to Outputs</h2>
<p>To manage my outputs I have three plug-ins that help add a layer of process to help get the work out the door.</p>
<h3>Projects</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/obsidian-projects-view.jpg" alt="screenshot of a kanban board for side projects" /></p>
<p>One of my favorite and most used features of my Notion was <a href="https://daverupert.com/2021/09/my-notion-blogging-kanban/">my Blogging Kanban</a>. This was the heart of my content generation flywheel; keeping track of all these scraps of ideas in different states. Blogging and side projects that have a somewhat linear flow and it‚Äôs great to visualize a post or project nearing a checkpoint or a published state.</p>
<p>Of all the kanban plugins I tried, Projects felt like the best fit. I know I‚Äôm violating open source protocol by heaping requests on free software, but I wish the querying and filtering was a bit more advanced. There‚Äôs a lot to be desired on achieving parity with Notion‚Äôs rich Kanban and Table system, but it looks like <a href="https://obsidian.md/roadmap/">dynamic tables is on the Obsidian roadmap</a>, so I‚Äôm fine using the nerfed versions for now.</p>
<h3>Longform</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/obsidian-longform-view.jpg" alt="screenshot of the longform sidebar UI panel with a story in the main content area" /></p>
<p>I have six or so shitty sci-fi stories burrowing a hole in my brain as well as an entire failed book pitch on prototypes. To help add structure to this process, I‚Äôve employed a plugin called Longform. It allows me to break stories up into scenes or chapters, rearrange them, and then stitch that all together into a manuscript for review.</p>
<h3>Write Good</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/obsidian-write-good-plugin.jpg" alt="screenshot of a run of text with highlighted erros like ‚Äúthe word so adds no meaning‚Äù, ‚Äúthe phrase there is unnecessary‚Äù, ‚Äúabsolutely can weaken meaning‚Äù, and ‚Äúmany is a weasel word‚Äù" /></p>
<p>Write Good is a poor man‚Äôs Grammarly. Unfettered, I tend to default to passive voice or use weasel words as sentence filler. For example, In the previous sentence I tried to use the word ‚Äúemploy‚Äù instead of ‚Äúuse‚Äù, like I‚Äôm the damn King of England. Write Good nudges me towards simpler phrasing and an active voice. Passive voice is natural for me and I don‚Äôt hate that part about me, but there are people (grammar nazis) who do care, so why not remove that stumbling block? Over time I‚Äôve come to prefer an enforced writing style and think the active voice tightens up most sentences.</p>
<p>Write Good also helps filter out technical writing no-nos like the word ‚Äú<a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/just/">Just</a>‚Äù. That itself is worth the price of entry. I can break the rules any time, but requires me turning off the part of my brain that obeys linters.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve actually been using Write Good for years but as part of a secondary <a href="https://daverupert.com/2021/10/pre-publish-blogging-rituals/">pre-publish process</a> as a <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=travisthetechie.write-good-linter">VS Code plugin</a>. With Obsidian I‚Äôve been able to ‚Äúshift left‚Äù that part of the process to the writing phase. Keeps me honest on how much work is actually left.</p>
<h2>What I don‚Äôt like about Obsidian</h2>
<p>After a month of solid use, I only have one major gripe: the finickiness of the editor.</p>
<p>The swapping between reading mode and editing mode feels erratic and jumpy in a way that Notion never did. I use a lot of <code>CMD + E</code> to manually swap between reading and editing, but it either remembers too well or not well enough on how I want to view different files. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever be happy here because I think the core problem is that rich text editing is weird.</p>
<p>One other aspect I think Obsidian could improve is creating a component library or style guide for plugins. Not all plugins generate side panel UI, but for those that do‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a zoo. I think a little effort here and design systems work for plugins could create a cohesive look and feel.</p>
<h2>The mobile app is fast</h2>
<p>One of Notion‚Äôs biggest well-known issues is poor app performance. I don‚Äôt spent my entire days worrying about this because I tend to be on desktop and once it‚Äôs opened, it‚Äôs opened. But after firing up Obsidian‚Äôs mobile app, you can‚Äôt unsee the difference.</p>
<p>Obsidian‚Äôs mobile app is fast. Downright instant. And it somehow dodges the finickiness of the macOS app I complained about above. I know it‚Äôs not the flagship product, but the mobile app feels like a first-party experience and not an afterthought. It‚Äôs useful and has the right performance profile for jotting little notes on the go.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs also impressive that all my JavaScript-based plugins are working inside the native mobile app. I assumed most plugins wouldn‚Äôt work inside the WebView environment<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>. This made for a situation where I had low expectations but was pleasantly surprised.</p>
<h2>Nothing beats a folder full of markdown files</h2>
<p>Obsidian reinforces a lesson I‚Äôve learned from my last decade and a half of blogging; nothing beats a folder full of markdown files. A note-taking app doesn‚Äôt have to be complex machinery. A little bit of YAML frontmatter can go a long way.</p>
<p>This migration identified one subtle problem I didn‚Äôt know I had; I ‚Äúover-databased‚Äù in Notion. I created entire sections in Notion with a database to get the editable table UI. This creates a lot of click-thru flows, excess documents, and feels like building an entire CMS for a one-page website. Obsidian nudges me to think more simple.</p>
<h2>Your productivity app and my productivity app will look different</h2>
<p>It took a solid month to migrate my thousands of documents to Notion. I declared bankruptcy on my Web Clipper links, but settled on <a href="https://daverupert.com/2025/05/obsidian-link-aggregator/">a better system with a link aggregator</a>. I think what learned through this process and giant deep-dive into productivity tools is that productivity is personal. Your dream setup and my dream setup will look different.</p>
<p>We have different brains that understand the world differently. Some people are Type A controlling, some are Type B hot-messes, and some of us are chill Type O. We have different goals for our note-taking apps; some might be pure archivists, some might be on a hustle grind, and some might need to organize their DnD sessions.</p>
<p>I come back to an old quote I‚Äôve mentioned a handful of times before from Kevin Kelley, founder of the Whole Earth Review‚Ä¶</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A tool is an opportunity with a handle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Grab hold of good tools that give you good opportunities.</p>

## 2025-05-18 Krka national park, Vodice

date: 2025-05-20, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-05-18-krka-national-park-vodice">2025-05-18 Krka national park, Vodice</h1>

<p>I‚Äôm falling behind with posting pictures. üò¨</p>

<p>I expected the Krka national park to be similar to <a href="2025-05-15-plitvice">our visit to Plitvice national park</a>.
But no, it was very different.
There were wooden walkways, lots of greenery growing in the rapids, lots of tufaceous limestone.
Everything else was different. üòÑ</p>

<p>It began with a long, steep trail from the parking lot down to the river.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-18-krka-1.jpg" alt="a trail through a pine forest" /></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-18-krka-5.jpg" alt="2025-05-18-krka-5.jpg" /></p>

<p>We reached the bottom and started on our trail.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-18-krka-6.jpg" alt="Alex standing on a woode walkway a few inches above the water surface" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-18-krka-7.jpg" alt="the water flows between little islands of greenery" />

<p>And the trail continues, the cascades pick up speed.</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-18-krka-19.jpg" alt="the same waterfall without people" /></p>

<p>Time to say goodbye to the Krka national park!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-18-krka-20.jpg" alt="more waterfalls in a lush landscape bursting with plants" /></p>

<p>We still had some time and decided to stop in Vodice on our way back to ≈†ibenik.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-18-krka-16.jpg" alt="Alex in a narrow alley" /></p>

<p>We mostly walked along the water towards Tribunj and back.
It&rsquo;s so nice to hear the waves and feel the breeze.</p>

<p>Apparently these trees grow mere meters from the ocean.
How do they do it?
They don&rsquo;t look like mangroves to me.
I assume some subterranean compartment to keep their water supply separate.</p>

## I am so sick and tired of "AI"

date: 2025-05-20, from: Liam on Linux

<div>Spent much of today getting a Live AROS USB key working, which wasn't trivial... it needed a USB 3 key, which I had to go and buy specially.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>But after that... I am so tired. I want to write about new stuff in software, but there feels to be no area not contaminated with &quot;AI&quot;.<br /><br />I&nbsp;get the depressing feeling that computing is just being eaten up by bloody &quot;AI&quot;. Virtually every press release I've seen this week has been AI. Mozilla adopts new AI search engine. Red Hat releases RHEL 10 with built in AI chat bot to help clueless PFYs admin the thing. Windows bloody Notepad has AI built in. AI in Google Docs. AI boosters in my mentions telling me and my friends that AI is helping them read antique books or whatever.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Is there anywhere outside of retrocomputing that doesn't have AI in it?</div><div>&nbsp;</div>The emperor has no clothes. LLM bots are not artificial and they are not intelligent. Not at all, not even a little bit, not even if you redefine the words &quot;artificial&quot; or &quot;intelligent&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;AI&quot; is not &quot;AI&quot;. The liars and the shills redefined what people used to mean by &quot;AI&quot; as &quot;AGI&quot;, artificial _general_ intelligence, so they could market their stupid plagiarism bots as AI.&nbsp;<br /><br />AGI is not real. It doesn't exist. It will probably never exist. Hell, at the rate humanity is going, we won't be able to build new computers any more by 2050 and the survivors at the poles will be nostalgic for electricity.<br /><br />AI is a scam. It's a hoax. It's fake news. There is no AI, and what is being sold as AI is such an incredibly poor fake that it is profoundly disheartening that so many people are so stupid to be deceived into thinking it is AI.<br /><br />The blockchain is a scam. Everything to do with it is a scam.&nbsp;<br /><br />Alternative medicine is a scam. All of it. There is no such thing. If it's called &quot;alternative&quot; that means it's been proved not to work.<br /><br />All religions are scams. No exceptions.&nbsp;<br /><br />People have made billions from selling scams for my whole lifetime.<br /><br />Meanwhile, other scams, like plastics being recyclable -- they aren't, it's a lie -- or biofuels -- also a lie -- mean our civilisation is on the verge of collapse. We are killing the planetary ecosphere that keeps us alive with plastic and pollution from burning stuff. We have to stop burning everything, stop cutting down trees, and stop making all forms of single-use products. No more jet planes. No more private cars. No more foreign holidays. We can't afford it.<br /><br />And with all that we are almost certainly still doomed.<br /><br />But I kind of want to see my industry go first, if all it's got now is AI.<br /><br />Snag is, I need a job. I have Ada to pay for.<br /><br /><br type="_moz" /><br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=95531" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments

Previously I had been showing <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22wordle%20kitty%22">results</a> in reverse chronologic order. So now, a <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22matt%20mullenweg%22">search for Matt Mullenweg</a> gets the same results but prioritized by MySQL. This is the <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/2857897ffe58bcb06362f00a7a72336a">query</a>.  What's nice is that the results are focused on the early 2000s, when the standards we use now were coming up. We can do this kind of stuff again. There's more to do. For example, it would be really cool if <a href="https://pocketcasts.com/">Pocket Casts</a>, their excellent podcast client, would let users publish their subscription list so we can build applications on them. There's a whole new base of data to work with. And unlike other media, podcast content is meant to be shared. The controversies that exist for professional writing and audiobooks, for example, don't apply to podcasts. If we could open this up, we could create an <a href="https://this.how/podcasting/#1733322866000">ecosystem</a> worth of applications very quickly. OPML is an easy format to get into a database. We just need sources of interesting data.

Because <a href="htps://nvidia.com">Nvidia</a> became one of the most valuable companies in the world, there are now two books explaining its rise and extolling the genius of Jensen Huang, Tae Kim's <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/1473342305"><i>The Nvidia Way: Jensen Huang and the making of a tech giant</i></a>, and Steven Witt's <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/1431034841"><i>The Thinking Machine: Jensen Huang, Nvidia, and the World's Most Coveted Microchip</i></a>. For the later 90% of the history I wasn't there, so I won't comment on their treatment of that part. But for the pre-history at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems">Sun Microsystems</a> and the first 10% of the history I was there. Kim's account of the business side of this era is detailed and, although it was three decades ago, matches my recollections.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhbU4txCGmC-bC_dLDYkpAqMHBx8ZlCP9NqK1rpK_CsIAsyA9Pb_lspC2mMyHZdeTKLFEP9FaUCREWi6NyBFoaMZ4Z7Rzy1rwbJJ7WSwK_z60njY96JxLxh-PKjJ9UunL6Nx_0tW4j4TIH33RB9ftibjIlsThbEM-IFicosmu-1OsrL-MGZUZFHtF1rPoY9/s654/Witt.png" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="654" data-original-width="430" height="200" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhbU4txCGmC-bC_dLDYkpAqMHBx8ZlCP9NqK1rpK_CsIAsyA9Pb_lspC2mMyHZdeTKLFEP9FaUCREWi6NyBFoaMZ4Z7Rzy1rwbJJ7WSwK_z60njY96JxLxh-PKjJ9UunL6Nx_0tW4j4TIH33RB9ftibjIlsThbEM-IFicosmu-1OsrL-MGZUZFHtF1rPoY9/w131-h200/Witt.png" width="131" /></a> 
Witt's account of the business side of the early history is much less detailed and some of the details don't match what I remember.<br />
<br />
But as regards the technical aspects of this early history it appears that neither author really understood the reasons for the two kinds of innovation we made; the imaging model and the I/O architecture. Witt <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/1431034841">writes (Page 31)</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The first time I asked Priem about the architecture of the NV1, he spoke uninterrupted for twenty-seven minutes.
</blockquote>
Below the fold, I try to explain what Curtis was talking about for those 27 minutes. It will take me quite a long post.

In the "Three Decades" section of <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/07/engineering-for-long-term.html"><i>Engineering For The Long Term</i></a> I wrote:<br />
<blockquote>
The opportunity we saw when we started Nvidia was that the PC was transitioning from the PC/AT bus to version 1 of the PCI bus. The PC/AT bus' bandwidth was completely inadequate for 3D games, but the PCI bus had considerably more. Whether it was enough was an open question. We clearly needed to make the best possible use of the limited bandwidth we could get.
</blockquote>
We had two basic ways of making "the best possible use of the limited bandwidth":<br />
<ul>
<li>Reduce the amount of data we needed to ship across the bus for a given image.</li>
<li>Increase the amount of data shipped in each cycle of the bus.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Imaging Model</h3>
A triangle is the simplest possible description of a surface. Thus almost the entire history of 3D computer graphics has modeled the surfaces of 3D objects using triangles. But there is a technique, dating back at least to Robert Mahl's 1972 paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/T-C.1972.223424"><i>Visible Surface Algorithms for Quadric Patches</i></a>, for modeling curved surfaces directly. It takes a lot more data to describe a quadric patch than a triangle. But to achieve equivalent realism you need so many fewer patches that the amount of data for each frame is reduced by a significant factor.<br />

As far as I know at the time only Sega in the video game industry used quadric patches. When we launched NV1 at Comdex we were able to show Sega arcade games such as <i>Virtua Fighter</i> running on a PC at full frame rate, a first for the industry. The reason was that NV1 used quadric patches and thus made better use of the limited PCI bus bandwidth.<br />
<br />
At Sun, James Gosling and I built the extremely sophisticated and forward-looking but proprietary <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/19778314">NeWS window system</a>. At the same time, I also worked with engineers at competitors such as Digital Equipment to build the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X Window System</a>. One of my many learning experiences at Sun came early in the <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/07/x-window-system-at-40.html">long history of the X Window System</a>. It rapidly became obvious to me that there was no way NeWS could compete with the much simpler, open-source X. I argued for Sun to open-source NeWS and failed. I argued for Sun to drop NeWS and adopt X, since that was what application developers wanted. Sun wasted precious time being unable to decide what to do, finally deciding not to decide and wasting a lot of resource merging NeWS and X into a kludge that was a worse NeWS and a worse X than its predecessors. This was just one of a number of fights at Sun I lost (<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/01/it-isnt-about-technology.html">this discusses another</a>).<br />
<br />
Once Microsoft announced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX">Direct X</a> it was obvious to me that Nvidia was doomed if the next chip did quadric patches, because the developers would have to work with Direct X's triangles. But, like Sun, Nvidia seemed unable to decide to abandon its cherished technology. Time for a decision to be effective was slipping away. I quit, hoping to shake things up so as to enable a decision to do triangles. It must have worked. The books recount how close Nvidia was to bankruptcy when RIVA 128 shipped. The rest is history for which I was just an observer.
<h3>I/O Architecture</h3>
In contrast the I/O architecture was, over time, the huge success we planned. Kim <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/1473342305">writes (Page 95)</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Early on, Curtis Priem had invented a "virtualized objects" architecture that would be incorporated in all of Nvidia's chips. It became an even bigger advantage for the company once Nvidia adopted the faster cadence of chip releases. Priem's design had a software based "resource manager", essentially a miniature operating system that sat on top of the hardware itself. The resource manager allowed Nvidia's engineers to emulate certain hardware features that normally needed to be physically printed onto chip circuits. This involved a performance cost but accelerated the pace of innovation, because Nvidia's engineers could take more risks. If the new feature wasn't ready to work in the hardware, Nvidia could emulate it in software. At the same time, engineers could take hardware features out when there was enough leftover computing power, saving chip area.<br />
<br />
For most of Nvidia's rivals, if a hardware feature on a chip wasn't ready, it would mean a schedule slip. Not, though, at Nvidia, thanks to Priem's innovation. "This was the most brilliant thing on the planet," said Michael Hara. "It was our secret sauce. If we missed a feature or a feature was broken, we could put it in the resource manager and it would work." Jeff Fisher, Nvidia's head of sales, agreed: "Priem's architecture was critical in enabling Nvidia to design and make new products faster."
</blockquote>
<h4>Context</h4>
Nvidia is just one of the many, many startups that Sun Microsystems spawned. But at the time what made Nvidia unique among the competing graphics startups was&nbsp;the early engineers from the team at Sun that built the GX series of graphics chips. We went through an intensive education in the techniques needed to implement graphics effectively in Unix, a multi-process, virtual memory operating system. The competitors all came from a Windows background, at the time a single-process, non-virtual memory system. We understood that, in the foreseeable future, Windows would have to evolve multi-processing and virtual memory. Thus the pitch to the VCs was that we would design a "future-proof" architecture, and deliver a Unix graphics chip for the PC's future operating system.<br />
<br />
The GX team also learned from the difficulty of shipping peripherals at Sun, where the software and hardware schedules were inextricable because the OS driver and apps needed detailed knowledge of the physical hardware. This led to "launch pad chicken", as each side tried to blame schedule slippage on the other.<br />
<h4>Write-mostly</h4>
Here is how we explained the problem in <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US5918050A/"><b>US5918050A</b>: Apparatus accessed at a physical I/O address for address and data translation and for context switching of I/O devices in response to commands from application programs</a> (inventors David S. H. Rosenthal and Curtis Priem), using the shorthand "PDP11 architecture" for systems whose I/O registers were mapped into the same address space as system memory:<br />
<blockquote>
Not only do input/output operations have to be carried out by operating system software, the design of computers utilizing the PDP11 architecture usually requires that registers at each of the input/output devices be read by the central processing unit in order to accomplish any input/output operation. As central processing units have become faster in order to speed up PDP11 type systems, it has been necessary to buffer write operations on the input/output bus because the bus cannot keep up with the speed of the central processing unit. Thus, each write operation is transferred by the central processing unit to a buffer where it is queued until it can be handled; other buffers in the line between the central processing unit and an input/output device function similarly. Before a read operation may occur, all of these write buffers must be flushed by performing their queued operations in serial order so that the correct sequence of operations is maintained. Thus, a central processing unit wishing to read data in a register at an input/output device must wait until all of the write buffers have been flushed before it can gain access to the bus to complete the read operation. Typical systems average eight write operations in their queues when a read operation occurs, and all of these write operations must be processed before the read operation may be processed. This has made read operations much slower than write operations. Since many of the operations required of the central processing unit with respect to graphics require reading very large numbers of pixels in the frame buffer, then translating those pixels, and finally rewriting them to new positions, graphics operations have become inordinately slow. In fact, modern graphics operations were the first operations to disclose this Achilles heel of the PDP11 architecture.

We took two approaches to avoiding blocking the CPU. First, we implemented a queue in the device, a FIFO (First In First Out), that was quite long, and we allowed the CPU to read from the FIFO the number of free slots, the number of writes it could do and be guaranteed not to block. When the CPU wanted to write to NV1 it would ask the FIFO how many writes it could do. If the answer were N, it would do N writes before asking again. NV1 would acknowledge each of those writes immediately, allowing the CPU to proceed to compute the data for the next write.  This was the subject of <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US5805930A/"><b>US5805930A</b></a>: <i>System for FIFO informing the availability of stages to store commands which include data and virtual address sent directly from application programs</i> (inventors David S. H. Rosenthal and Curtis Priem), the continuation of an application we filed 15<sup>th</sup> May 1995. Note that this meant the application didn't need to know the size of the device's FIFO. If a future chip had a bigger or smaller FIFO, the unchanged application would use it correctly.<br />
<br />
Second, we tried as far as possible not to use the CPU to transfer data to and from NV1. Instead, whenever we could we used Direct Memory Access, in which the I/O device reads and writes system memory independently of the CPU. In most cases, the CPU instructed NV1 to do something with one, or a few writes, and then got on with its program. The instruction typically said "here in memory is a block of quadric patches for you to render". If the CPU needed an answer, it would tell NV1 where in system memory to put it and, at intervals, check to see if it had arrived.<br />
<br />
Remember that we were creating this architecture for a virtual memory system in which applications had direct access to the I/O device. The applications addressed system memory in virtual addresses. The system's Memory Management Unit (MMU) translated these into the physical addresses that the bus used. When an application told the device the address of the block of patches, it could only send the device one of its <i>virtual</i> addresses. To fetch the patches from system memory, the DMA engine on the device needed to translate the virtual address into a <i>physical</i> address on the bus in the same way that the CPU's MMU did.<br />
<br />
So NV1 didn't just have a DMA engine, it had an IOMMU as well. We patented this IOMMU as <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US5758182A/"><b>US5758182A</b></a>: <i>DMA controller translates virtual I/O device address received directly from application program command to physical i/o device address of I/O device on device bus</i> (inventors David S. H. Rosenthal and Curtis Priem). In 2014's <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/12/hardware-io-virtualization.html"><i>Hardware I/O Virtualization</i></a> I explained how Amazon ended up building network interfaces with IOMMUs for the servers in AWS data centers so that mutiple virtual machines could have direct access to the network hardware and thus eliminate operating system overhead.
<h4>Context switching</h4>
The fundamental problem for graphics support in a multi-process operating system such as Unix (and later Linux, Windows, MacOS, ...) is that of providing multiple processes the illusion that each has exclusive access to the single graphics device. I started fighting this problem in 1983 at Carnegie-Mellon. James Gosling and I built the Andrew Window System, which allowed multiple processes to share access to the screen, each in its own window. But they didn't have access to the real hardware. There was a single server process that accessed the real hardware. Applications made remote procedure calls (RPCs) to this server, which actually drew the requested graphics. Four decades later the X Window System still works this way.<br />
<br />
RPCs imposed a performance penalty that made 3D games unusable. To allow, for example, a game to run in one window while a mail program ran in another we needed the currently active process to have direct access to the hardware, and if the operating system context-switched to a different graphics process, give that process direct access to the hardware. The operating system would need to save the first process' state from the graphics hardware, and restore the second process' state<br />
<br />
Our work on this problem at Sun led to a patent filed in 1989, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US5127098A/"><b>US5127098A</b></a>: <i>Method and apparatus for the context switching of devices</i> (inventors David S. H. Rosenthal, Robert Rocchetti, Curtis Priem, and Chris Malachowsky). The idea was to have the device mapped into each process' memory but to use the system's memory management unit (MMU) ensure that at any one time all but one of the mappings was <i>invalid</i>. A process' access to an invalid mapping would interrupt into the system's page fault handler, which would invoke the device's driver to save the old process' context and restore the new process' context. The general problem with this idea is that, because the interrupt ends up in the page fault handler, it requires device-dependent code in the page fault handler. This is precisely the kind of connection between software and hardware that caused schedule problems at Sun.<br />
<br />
There were two specific Nvidia problems with this idea. First that Windows wasn't a virtual memory operating system so you couldn't do any of this. And second that even once Windows had evolved into a virtual memory operating system, Microsoft was unlikely to let us mess with the page fault handler.<br />

As you can see in Figure 6 of the <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US5805930A/">'930 patent</a>, the I/O architecture consisted of an interface between the PCI bus and an internal bus that could implement a number of different I/O devices. The interface provided a number of capabilities:<br />
<ul>
<li>It implemented the FIFO, sharing it among all the devices on the internal bus.</li>
<li>It implemented the DMA engine and its IOMMU, sharing it among all the devices on the internal bus.</li>
<li>Using a translation table, it allowed applications to connect to a specific device on the internal bus via the interface using a virtual name.</li>
<li>It ensured that only one application at a time could access the interface.</li>
</ul>
The difference between the PCI and PC/AT buses wasn't just that the data path grew from 16 to 32 bits, but also that the address bus grew from 24 to 32 bits. The address space was 256 times bigger, thus Nvidia's devices could occupy much more of it. We could implement many virtual FIFOs, so that each application could have a <i>valid</i> mapping to one of them. The device, <i>not the operating system</i>, would ensure that only one of the virtual FIFOs was mapped to the single physical FIFO. A process accessing a virtual FIFO that wasn't mapped to the physical FIFO would cause an interrupt, but this time the interrupt would go to the device's driver, not the page fault handler. The driver could perform the context switch, and re-assign the physical FIFO to the new virtual FIFO. It would also have to copy page table entries from the CPU's MMU into the IOMMU to reflect the placement of the new process' pages in physical memory. There would be no page fault so no knowledge of the device in the operating system's page fault handler.  As we wrote in the <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US5918050A/">'050 patent</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
the use of many identically-sized input/output device address spaces each assigned for use only by one application program allows the input/output addresses to be utilized to determine which application program has initiated any particular input/output write operation.
</blockquote>
Because applications each saw their own virtual FIFO, future chips could implement multiple physical FIFOs, allowing the virtual FIFO of more than one process to be assigned a physical FIFO, which would reduce the need for context switching.<br />

One of the great things about NeWS was that it was programmed in PostScript. We had figured out how to make PostScript <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">object-oriented</a>, homomorphic to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk">SmallTalk</a>. We organized objects in the window system in a class hierarchy with inheritance. This, for example, allowed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Hopkins">Don Hopkins</a> to implement <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/05/pie-menus.html">pie menus</a> for NeWS in such a way that any user could replace the traditional rectangular menus with pie menus. This was such fun that Owen Densmore and I used the same technique to <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US5187786A/en">implement object-oriented programming for the Unix shell</a>.<br />
<br />
At a time when PC memory maxed out at 640 megabytes, the fact that the PCI bus could address 4 gigabytes meant that quite a few of its address bits were surplus. So we decided to increase the amount of data shipped in each bus cycle by using some of them as data. IIRC NV1 used 23 address bits, occupying 1/512th of the total space. 7 of the 23 selected one of the 128 virtual FIFOs, allowing 128 different processes to share access to the hardware. We figured 128 processes was plenty.<br />
<br />

The remaining 16 address bits could be used as data. In theory the FIFO could be 48 bits wide, 32 from the data lines on the bus and 16 from the address lines, a 50% increase in bits per bus cycle. NV1 ignored the byte part of the address so the FIFO was only 46 bits wide.<br />
<br />
So we organized the objects in our I/O architecture in a class hierarchy, rooted at class CLASS. The first thing an application did was to invoke the <tt>enumerate()</tt> method on the object representing class CLASS. This returned a list of the names of all the instances of class CLASS, i.e. all the object types this instance of the architecture implemented. In this way capabilities of the device weren't wired in to the application. The application asked the device what its capabilities were. In turn, the application could invoke <tt>enumerate()</tt> on each of the instances of class CLASS in the list, which would get the application a list of the names of each of the instances of each class, perhaps <tt>LINE-DRAWER</tt>.Thus the application would find out rather than know <i>a priori</i> the names of all the resources (virtual objects) of all the different types that the device supported.<br />
<br />
The application could then create objects, instances of these classes, by invoking the <tt>instantiate()</tt> method on the class object with a 32-bit name for the newly created object. The interface was thus limited to 4B objects for each application. The application could then <tt>select()</tt> the named object, causing an interrupt if there was no entry for it in the translation table so the resource manager could create one. The 64Kbyte address space of each FIFO was divided into 8 8K "sub-areas". The application could <tt>select()</tt> an object in each, so it could operate on 8 objects at a time.  Subsequent writes to each sub-area were interpreted as method invocations on the selected object, the word offset from the base of each sub-area within the 8Kbyte space specifying the method and the data being the argument to the method. The interface thus supported 2048 different methods per object.<br />
<br />
In this way we ensured that all knowledge of the physical resources of the device was contained in the resource manager. It was the resource manager that implemented class CLASS and its instances. Thus it was that the resource manager controlled which instances of class CLASS (types of virtual object) were implemented in hardware, and which were implemented by software in the resource manager. It was possible to store the resource manager's code in read-only memory on the device's PCI card, inextricably linking the device and its resource manager. The only thing the driver for the board needed to be able to do was to route the device's interrupts to the resource manager.<br />
<br />
The importance of the fact that all an application could do was to invoke methods on virtual objects was that the application could not know whether the object was implemented in hardware or in the resource manager's software. The flexibility to make this decision at any time was a huge advantage. As Kim quotes <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/1473342305">Michael Hara as saying</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
This was the most brilliant thing on the planet. It was our secret sauce. If we missed a feature or a feature was broken, we could put it in the resource manager and it would work."
</blockquote>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
As you can see, NV1 was very far from the "<a href="https://www.editiongroup.com/us/insights/minimum-viable-product-guide-for-founders">minimal viable product</a>" beloved of today's VCs. Their idea is to get something into users' hands as soon as possible, then iterate rapidly based on their feedback. But what Nvidia's VCs did by giving us the time to develop a real chip architecture was to enable Nvidia, after the failure of the first product, to iterate rapidly based on the second. Iterating rapidly on graphics chips <i>requires</i> that applications not know the details of successive chip's hardware.<br />
<br />
I have been privileged in my career to work with extraordinarily skilled engineers. Curtis Priem was one, others included James Gosling, the late Bill Shannon, Steve Kleiman, and Jim Gettys. <a href="https://patents.google.com/?inventor=rosenthal,priem&amp;oq=inventor:+rosenthal+inventor:+priem">This search</a> returns 2 Sun patents and 19 Nvidia patents for which both Curtis Priem and I are named inventors.  Of the Nvidia patents, Curtis is the lead inventor on 9 and I am the lead inventor on the rest.  Most describe parts of the Nvidia architecture, combining Curtis' exceptional understanding of hardware with my understanding of operating systems to redefine how I/O should work.  I rate this architecture as my career best engineering. It was certainly the most impactful. Thank you, Curtis!<br />

## Andrew Hickey

date: 2025-05-19, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2tjsq6a4vn6pww2iva5qj23v">Andrew Hickey</a> whose <a href="https://500songs.com/podcast/">podcast</a> I support, also appears to be strongly against people using ChatGPT. </p>
<p>I am a programmer, so you might think I'd see it the same way because what I do is similar to what musicians and prose writers do in that I create "intellectual property" which can be easily copied.</p>
<p>But we have a different culture in software, we tend to by default share what we do and let other people use it. They're supposed to credit us, but people are selfish and greedy and they will tend to take whatever isn't bolted down, and it sucks, but you accept it.</p>
<p>What's funny is Hickey appears to have no clue how much he's benefited from this ethos. His success probably would not have been possible without some people thinking it's more important to create the medium he could use any way he saw fit, than to own one that would probably have kept him out.</p>
<p>Creating is not as linear as he appears to think, which so ironic because that's basically what his freaking podcast is about. He loves to say "no one did anything first" (paraphrasing) and that's basically the <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/09/09/onlyStealFromTheBest.html">same idea</a>.</p>
<p>And I don't doubt that the next big media invention, the next <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=podcasting">podcasting</a> perhaps, will benefit enormously from having ChatGPT available for the people developing it.</p>
<p>PS: This appeared earlier as a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lpjn22v22s2k">post</a> on Bluesky. And I wrote every freaking word, as I always do unless disclaimed.</p>

Here's a search for <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22menu%20sharing%22">menu sharing</a> which was a technology we made on the Mac that allowed people to write menus of scripts in Frontier that appear inside other apps. Netscape supported it as did MSIE, Quark, Eudora and many others. It was kind of magical, esp when the apps themselves were scriptable (many of them were in the 90s). Next up, I'm going to import the home page of Scripting News from 1997 to 2010. It was mostly a linkblog then.

I don't know any Celtics fans, but I imagine there are some subscribers who are. Hard to imagine how hard the last series hit you all. I don't have anything against the Celtics these days although Paul Pierce is an asshole, and I hope you all know that. Just watched the OKC win over Denver. All around an incredible group in the final four, very diverse and inclusive. And btw now that I think of it, Jaylen Brown was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSu9DYgvn1E">grabbing</a> Knicks players by the balls. I hope you all come to terms with that.
