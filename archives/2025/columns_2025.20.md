## 2025-05-19 Split

date: 2025-05-20, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-05-19-split">2025-05-19 Split</h1>

<p>We drove all the way to Split, visited the old town and what remains of Diocletians palace, had lunch and then we went walking through Marjan forest park. Wonderfully quiet.</p>

<p>On the way to the city center, I spotted a passion flower. So beautiful.
They look like cosmic spaceships or pschedelic temples in miniature.</p>

<p>Blaue Passionsblume<br>
Passiflora caerulea</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-1.jpg" alt="a flower with an complex, three-dimensional structure in the middle" /></p>

<p>The marina in front of the old town.
Half the old town is with the perimeter of Diocletian&rsquo;s palace.</p>

<p>The water is dirty and smells bad.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-2.jpg" alt="a marina with small boats and a boulevard with palm trees" /></p>

<p>They turned Diocletian&rsquo;s mausoleum into the cathedral.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-3.jpg" alt="Claudia near the bell tower of the cathedral, with tourists in the back" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-4.jpg" alt="looking up a the bell tower" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-5.jpg" alt="from a nearby ruin with an open cupola, the bell tower can still be seen" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-6.jpg" alt="Split&rsquo;s old town is full of narrow alleys" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-7.jpg" alt="there is an open pit where you can see into the cellar ruins of Diocletian&rsquo;s palace" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-8.jpg" alt="looking back at the bell tower" /></p>

<p>There are places where you can see two levels of cellars and three or four levels of buildings.
This how I like my dungeon ruins. 😄</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-9.jpg" alt="looking into another pit with access to underground levels" /></p>

<p>What impressed me the most is that people live in the midst of these fantastic ruins.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-10.jpg" alt="extremely narrow alleys" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-11.jpg" alt="and suddenly, a private garden" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-12.jpg" alt="and ruins, and tourists" /></p>

<p>We went into the cathedral.
It&rsquo;s a small octagonal building because it used to be Diocletions tomb.
I was not impressed.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-13.jpg" alt="looking up at the ceiling" /></p>

<p>Looking back over the corner with the carden (to the left) and the low walls from where one could peek into the cellars.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-14.jpg" alt="a view of Diocletian&rsquo;s palace with tourist milling about" />

<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-16.jpg" alt="more narrow alleys" /></p>

<p>We had enough after a while, had a small lunch and decided to head into the Marjan forest park.
The stairs up start in the old town.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-17.jpg" alt="Claudia on marble stairs" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-18.jpg" alt="looking at Split&rsquo;s old town from the stairs" /></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-19.jpg" alt="a yellow flower on a cactus" /></p>

<p>Stechendes Sternauge<br>
Pallenis spinosa</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-20.jpg" alt="yellow flowers and spiny leaves" /></p>

<p>Dry stone walls everywhere. Later there was even an info board talking about dry stone wall building.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-21.jpg" alt="some tall corniferous trees behind a dry stone wall" /></p>

<p>The trail from the end of the stairs to Sedlow is wide, flat, and beautiful.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-22.jpg" alt="Claudia on a nice walkway" /></p>

<p>Johannisbrotbaum<br>
Ceratonia siliqua</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-23.jpg" alt="thick, saussage-like beans hanging on a tree" /></p>

<p>The nice walkway turns into a trail.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-24.jpg" alt="a trail along a dry wall with trees off to the side providing no shade" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-25.jpg" alt="the trail continues and still the trees provide no shade" /></p>

<p>The trail gets narrower and we start thinking of ticks again.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-26.jpg" alt="a singletrail with grass and bushes growing nearby; some sort of info panel in the distance" /></p>

<p>A view of a hidden sandy (?) beach.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-28.jpg" alt="trees in the foreground and the sea in the back" /></p>

<p>We walked back along the coast and looked up. Our trail was somewhere behind this cliff.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-19-split-29.jpg" alt="a forested hill and while cliffs at the top" /></p>

<p>In the evening we went for pizza and pasta.</p>

## 2025-05-18 Krka national park, Vodice

date: 2025-05-20, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2025-05-18-krka-national-park-vodice">2025-05-18 Krka national park, Vodice</h1>

<p>I’m falling behind with posting pictures. 😬</p>

<p>I expected the Krka national park to be similar to <a href="2025-05-15-plitvice">our visit to Plitvice national park</a>.
But no, it was very different.
There were wooden walkways, lots of greenery growing in the rapids, lots of tufaceous limestone.
Everything else was different. 😄</p>

<p>It began with a long, steep trail from the parking lot down to the river.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-18-krka-1.jpg" alt="a trail through a pine forest" /></p>

<p>Spitzenfleck<br>
Libellula fulva</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-18-krka-2.jpg" alt="a blue dragonfly" /></p>

<p>Kretischer Ziest<br>
Stachys cretica</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-18-krka-3.jpg" alt="2025-05-18-krka-3.jpg" /></p>

<p>Knäuelköpfige Distel<br>
Carduus pycnocephalus</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-18-krka-4.jpg" alt="2025-05-18-krka-4.jpg" /></p>

<p>Tüpfel-Hartheu<br>
Hypericum perforatum</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-18-krka-5.jpg" alt="2025-05-18-krka-5.jpg" /></p>

<p>We reached the bottom and started on our trail.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-18-krka-6.jpg" alt="Alex standing on a woode walkway a few inches above the water surface" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-18-krka-7.jpg" alt="the water flows between little islands of greenery" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-18-krka-8.jpg" alt="then walkway snakes its way over the rapids; trees are everywhere" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-18-krka-9.jpg" alt="sometimes the water lies still" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-18-krka-10.jpg" alt="Alex and Claudia, both wearing hats" /></p>

<p>Calopterix virgo</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-18-krka-12.jpg" alt="another steel blue damselfly" /></p>

<p>And the trail continues, the cascades pick up speed.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-18-krka-13.jpg" alt="water flowing between grass, reeds, trees" /></p>

<p>A waterfall with and and without people:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-18-krka-14.jpg" alt="people queuing for a selfie in front of a waterfall" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-18-krka-15.jpg" alt="a beautiful watefall" /></p>

<p>Another waterfall with and and without people:</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-18-krka-18.jpg" alt="the walkway has a rail and people lean ot it, posing for selfies, with the waterfall in the back" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-18-krka-19.jpg" alt="the same waterfall without people" /></p>

<p>Time to say goodbye to the Krka national park!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-18-krka-20.jpg" alt="more waterfalls in a lush landscape bursting with plants" /></p>

<p>We still had some time and decided to stop in Vodice on our way back to Šibenik.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-18-krka-16.jpg" alt="Alex in a narrow alley" /></p>

<p>We mostly walked along the water towards Tribunj and back.
It&rsquo;s so nice to hear the waves and feel the breeze.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-18-krka-17.jpg" alt="Claudie standing on some concrete foundations near a pebble stone beach, taking a picture" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-18-krka-27.jpg" alt="a pebble stone beach" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-18-krka-23.jpg" alt="Alex and Claudia, both wearing hats and sunglasses" /></p>

<p>Weißfilziges Greiskraut<br>
Jacobaea maritima</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-18-krka-24.jpg" alt="yellow flowers, about to open" />
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-05-18-krka-25.jpg" alt="yellow flowers, fully open" /></p>

<p>Apparently these trees grow mere meters from the ocean.
How do they do it?
They don&rsquo;t look like mangroves to me.
I assume some subterranean compartment to keep their water supply separate.</p>

## I am so sick and tired of "AI"

date: 2025-05-20, from: Liam on Linux

<div>Spent much of today getting a Live AROS USB key working, which wasn't trivial... it needed a USB 3 key, which I had to go and buy specially.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>But after that... I am so tired. I want to write about new stuff in software, but there feels to be no area not contaminated with &quot;AI&quot;.<br /><br />I&nbsp;get the depressing feeling that computing is just being eaten up by bloody &quot;AI&quot;. Virtually every press release I've seen this week has been AI. Mozilla adopts new AI search engine. Red Hat releases RHEL 10 with built in AI chat bot to help clueless PFYs admin the thing. Windows bloody Notepad has AI built in. AI in Google Docs. AI boosters in my mentions telling me and my friends that AI is helping them read antique books or whatever.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Is there anywhere outside of retrocomputing that doesn't have AI in it?</div><div>&nbsp;</div>The emperor has no clothes. LLM bots are not artificial and they are not intelligent. Not at all, not even a little bit, not even if you redefine the words &quot;artificial&quot; or &quot;intelligent&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;AI&quot; is not &quot;AI&quot;. The liars and the shills redefined what people used to mean by &quot;AI&quot; as &quot;AGI&quot;, artificial _general_ intelligence, so they could market their stupid plagiarism bots as AI.&nbsp;<br /><br />AGI is not real. It doesn't exist. It will probably never exist. Hell, at the rate humanity is going, we won't be able to build new computers any more by 2050 and the survivors at the poles will be nostalgic for electricity.<br /><br />AI is a scam. It's a hoax. It's fake news. There is no AI, and what is being sold as AI is such an incredibly poor fake that it is profoundly disheartening that so many people are so stupid to be deceived into thinking it is AI.<br /><br />The blockchain is a scam. Everything to do with it is a scam.&nbsp;<br /><br />Alternative medicine is a scam. All of it. There is no such thing. If it's called &quot;alternative&quot; that means it's been proved not to work.<br /><br />All religions are scams. No exceptions.&nbsp;<br /><br />People have made billions from selling scams for my whole lifetime.<br /><br />Meanwhile, other scams, like plastics being recyclable -- they aren't, it's a lie -- or biofuels -- also a lie -- mean our civilisation is on the verge of collapse. We are killing the planetary ecosphere that keeps us alive with plastic and pollution from burning stuff. We have to stop burning everything, stop cutting down trees, and stop making all forms of single-use products. No more jet planes. No more private cars. No more foreign holidays. We can't afford it.<br /><br />And with all that we are almost certainly still doomed.<br /><br />But I kind of want to see my industry go first, if all it's got now is AI.<br /><br />Snag is, I need a job. I have Ada to pay for.<br /><br /><br type="_moz" /><br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=95531" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-05-20, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/04/01/siliconValley.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">MySQL, which I'm using for Daytona, has the idea of <a href="https://claude.ai/share/3ec3cd5e-87d8-4a78-9356-464f2b26cf0d">relevance</a> in searches. Previously I had been showing results in reverse chronologic order. So now, a <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22matt%20mullenweg%22">search for Matt Mullenweg</a> gets the same results but prioritized by MySQL. This is the <a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/2857897ffe58bcb06362f00a7a72336a">query</a>.  What's nice is that the results are focused on the early 2000s, when the standards we use now were coming up. We can do this kind of stuff again. There's more to do. For example, it would be really cool if Pocket Casts, their excellent podcast client, would let a user publish their subscription list so we can build applications on it. There's a whole new base of data to work with. And unlike other media, podcast content is meant to be shared. The controversies that exist for professional writing and audiobooks, for example, don't seem to apply to podcasts, with the caveat that I am not a lawyer. If we could open this up, we could create an ecosystem worth of applications very quickly. OPML is an easy format to ingest into a database. FeedLand for example, does some wonderful things with OPML. We just need sources of interesting data. Today it's locked up in the podcast clients.

Because <a href="htps://nvidia.com">Nvidia</a> became one of the most valuable companies in the world, there are now two books explaining its rise and extolling the genius of Jensen Huang, Tae Kim's <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/1473342305"><i>The Nvidia Way: Jensen Huang and the making of a tech giant</i></a>, and Steven Witt's <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/1431034841"><i>The Thinking Machine: Jensen Huang, Nvidia, and the World's Most Coveted Microchip</i></a>. For the later 90% of the history I wasn't there, so I won't comment on their treatment of that part. But for the pre-history at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems">Sun Microsystems</a> and the first 10% of the history I was there. Kim's account of the business side of this era is detailed and, although it was three decades ago, matches my recollections.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhbU4txCGmC-bC_dLDYkpAqMHBx8ZlCP9NqK1rpK_CsIAsyA9Pb_lspC2mMyHZdeTKLFEP9FaUCREWi6NyBFoaMZ4Z7Rzy1rwbJJ7WSwK_z60njY96JxLxh-PKjJ9UunL6Nx_0tW4j4TIH33RB9ftibjIlsThbEM-IFicosmu-1OsrL-MGZUZFHtF1rPoY9/s654/Witt.png" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="654" data-original-width="430" height="200" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhbU4txCGmC-bC_dLDYkpAqMHBx8ZlCP9NqK1rpK_CsIAsyA9Pb_lspC2mMyHZdeTKLFEP9FaUCREWi6NyBFoaMZ4Z7Rzy1rwbJJ7WSwK_z60njY96JxLxh-PKjJ9UunL6Nx_0tW4j4TIH33RB9ftibjIlsThbEM-IFicosmu-1OsrL-MGZUZFHtF1rPoY9/w131-h200/Witt.png" width="131" /></a> 
Witt's account of the business side of the early history is much less detailed and some of the details don't match what I remember.<br />
<br />
But as regards the technical aspects of this early history it appears that neither author really understood the reasons for the two kinds of innovation we made; the imaging model and the I/O architecture. Witt <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/1431034841">writes (Page 31)</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The first time I asked Priem about the architecture of the NV1, he spoke uninterrupted for twenty-seven minutes.
</blockquote>
Below the fold, I try to explain what Curtis was talking about for those 27 minutes. It will take me quite a long post.

<li>Reduce the amount of data we needed to ship across the bus for a given image.</li>
<li>Increase the amount of data shipped in each cycle of the bus.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Imaging Model</h3>
A triangle is the simplest possible description of a surface. Thus almost the entire history of 3D computer graphics has modeled the surfaces of 3D objects using triangles. But there is a technique, dating back at least to Robert Mahl's 1972 paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/T-C.1972.223424"><i>Visible Surface Algorithms for Quadric Patches</i></a>, for modeling curved surfaces directly. It takes a lot more data to describe a quadric patch than a triangle. But to achieve equivalent realism you need so many fewer patches that the amount of data for each frame is reduced by a significant factor.<br />

As far as I know at the time only Sega in the video game industry used quadric patches. When we launched NV1 at Comdex we were able to show Sega arcade games such as <i>Virtua Fighter</i> running on a PC at full frame rate, a first for the industry. The reason was that NV1 used quadric patches and thus made better use of the limited PCI bus bandwidth.<br />
<br />
At Sun, James Gosling and I built the extremely sophisticated and forward-looking but proprietary <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/19778314">NeWS window system</a>. At the same time, I also worked with engineers at competitors such as Digital Equipment to build the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X Window System</a>. One of my many learning experiences at Sun came early in the <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/07/x-window-system-at-40.html">long history of the X Window System</a>. It rapidly became obvious to me that there was no way NeWS could compete with the much simpler, open-source X. I argued for Sun to open-source NeWS and failed. I argued for Sun to drop NeWS and adopt X, since that was what application developers wanted. Sun wasted precious time being unable to decide what to do, finally deciding not to decide and wasting a lot of resource merging NeWS and X into a kludge that was a worse NeWS and a worse X than its predecessors. This was just one of a number of fights at Sun I lost (<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/01/it-isnt-about-technology.html">this discusses another</a>).<br />
<br />
Once Microsoft announced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX">Direct X</a> it was obvious to me that Nvidia was doomed if the next chip did quadric patches, because the developers would have to work with Direct X's triangles. But, like Sun, Nvidia seemed unable to decide to abandon its cherished technology. Time for a decision to be effective was slipping away. I quit, hoping to shake things up so as to enable a decision to do triangles. It must have worked. The books recount how close Nvidia was to bankruptcy when RIVA 128 shipped. The rest is history for which I was just an observer.
<h3>I/O Architecture</h3>
In contrast the I/O architecture was, over time, the huge success we planned. Kim <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/1473342305">writes (Page 95)</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Early on, Curtis Priem had invented a "virtualized objects" architecture that would be incorporated in all of Nvidia's chips. It became an even bigger advantage for the company once Nvidia adopted the faster cadence of chip releases. Priem's design had a software based "resource manager", essentially a miniature operating system that sat on top of the hardware itself. The resource manager allowed Nvidia's engineers to emulate certain hardware features that normally needed to be physically printed onto chip circuits. This involved a performance cost but accelerated the pace of innovation, because Nvidia's engineers could take more risks. If the new feature wasn't ready to work in the hardware, Nvidia could emulate it in software. At the same time, engineers could take hardware features out when there was enough leftover computing power, saving chip area.<br />
<br />
For most of Nvidia's rivals, if a hardware feature on a chip wasn't ready, it would mean a schedule slip. Not, though, at Nvidia, thanks to Priem's innovation. "This was the most brilliant thing on the planet," said Michael Hara. "It was our secret sauce. If we missed a feature or a feature was broken, we could put it in the resource manager and it would work." Jeff Fisher, Nvidia's head of sales, agreed: "Priem's architecture was critical in enabling Nvidia to design and make new products faster."

<h4>Context</h4>
Nvidia is just one of the many, many startups that Sun Microsystems spawned. But at the time what made Nvidia unique among the competing graphics startups was&nbsp;the early engineers from the team at Sun that built the GX series of graphics chips. We went through an intensive education in the techniques needed to implement graphics effectively in Unix, a multi-process, virtual memory operating system. The competitors all came from a Windows background, at the time a single-process, non-virtual memory system. We understood that, in the foreseeable future, Windows would have to evolve multi-processing and virtual memory. Thus the pitch to the VCs was that we would design a "future-proof" architecture, and deliver a Unix graphics chip for the PC's future operating system.<br />
<br />
The GX team also learned from the difficulty of shipping peripherals at Sun, where the software and hardware schedules were inextricable because the OS driver and apps needed detailed knowledge of the physical hardware. This led to "launch pad chicken", as each side tried to blame schedule slippage on the other.<br />
<h4>Write-mostly</h4>
Here is how we explained the problem in <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US5918050A/"><b>US5918050A</b>: Apparatus accessed at a physical I/O address for address and data translation and for context switching of I/O devices in response to commands from application programs</a> (inventors David S. H. Rosenthal and Curtis Priem), using the shorthand "PDP11 architecture" for systems whose I/O registers were mapped into the same address space as system memory:<br />
<blockquote>
Not only do input/output operations have to be carried out by operating system software, the design of computers utilizing the PDP11 architecture usually requires that registers at each of the input/output devices be read by the central processing unit in order to accomplish any input/output operation. As central processing units have become faster in order to speed up PDP11 type systems, it has been necessary to buffer write operations on the input/output bus because the bus cannot keep up with the speed of the central processing unit. Thus, each write operation is transferred by the central processing unit to a buffer where it is queued until it can be handled; other buffers in the line between the central processing unit and an input/output device function similarly. Before a read operation may occur, all of these write buffers must be flushed by performing their queued operations in serial order so that the correct sequence of operations is maintained. Thus, a central processing unit wishing to read data in a register at an input/output device must wait until all of the write buffers have been flushed before it can gain access to the bus to complete the read operation. Typical systems average eight write operations in their queues when a read operation occurs, and all of these write operations must be processed before the read operation may be processed. This has made read operations much slower than write operations. Since many of the operations required of the central processing unit with respect to graphics require reading very large numbers of pixels in the frame buffer, then translating those pixels, and finally rewriting them to new positions, graphics operations have become inordinately slow. In fact, modern graphics operations were the first operations to disclose this Achilles heel of the PDP11 architecture.

We took two approaches to avoiding blocking the CPU. First, we implemented a queue in the device, a FIFO (First In First Out), that was quite long, and we allowed the CPU to read from the FIFO the number of free slots, the number of writes it could do and be guaranteed not to block. When the CPU wanted to write to NV1 it would ask the FIFO how many writes it could do. If the answer were N, it would do N writes before asking again. NV1 would acknowledge each of those writes immediately, allowing the CPU to proceed to compute the data for the next write.  This was the subject of <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US5805930A/"><b>US5805930A</b></a>: <i>System for FIFO informing the availability of stages to store commands which include data and virtual address sent directly from application programs</i> (inventors David S. H. Rosenthal and Curtis Priem), the continuation of an application we filed 15<sup>th</sup> May 1995. Note that this meant the application didn't need to know the size of the device's FIFO. If a future chip had a bigger or smaller FIFO, the unchanged application would use it correctly.<br />
<br />
Second, we tried as far as possible not to use the CPU to transfer data to and from NV1. Instead, whenever we could we used Direct Memory Access, in which the I/O device reads and writes system memory independently of the CPU. In most cases, the CPU instructed NV1 to do something with one, or a few writes, and then got on with its program. The instruction typically said "here in memory is a block of quadric patches for you to render". If the CPU needed an answer, it would tell NV1 where in system memory to put it and, at intervals, check to see if it had arrived.<br />
<br />
Remember that we were creating this architecture for a virtual memory system in which applications had direct access to the I/O device. The applications addressed system memory in virtual addresses. The system's Memory Management Unit (MMU) translated these into the physical addresses that the bus used. When an application told the device the address of the block of patches, it could only send the device one of its <i>virtual</i> addresses. To fetch the patches from system memory, the DMA engine on the device needed to translate the virtual address into a <i>physical</i> address on the bus in the same way that the CPU's MMU did.<br />
<br />
So NV1 didn't just have a DMA engine, it had an IOMMU as well. We patented this IOMMU as <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US5758182A/"><b>US5758182A</b></a>: <i>DMA controller translates virtual I/O device address received directly from application program command to physical i/o device address of I/O device on device bus</i> (inventors David S. H. Rosenthal and Curtis Priem). In 2014's <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/12/hardware-io-virtualization.html"><i>Hardware I/O Virtualization</i></a> I explained how Amazon ended up building network interfaces with IOMMUs for the servers in AWS data centers so that mutiple virtual machines could have direct access to the network hardware and thus eliminate operating system overhead.
<h4>Context switching</h4>
The fundamental problem for graphics support in a multi-process operating system such as Unix (and later Linux, Windows, MacOS, ...) is that of providing multiple processes the illusion that each has exclusive access to the single graphics device. I started fighting this problem in 1983 at Carnegie-Mellon. James Gosling and I built the Andrew Window System, which allowed multiple processes to share access to the screen, each in its own window. But they didn't have access to the real hardware. There was a single server process that accessed the real hardware. Applications made remote procedure calls (RPCs) to this server, which actually drew the requested graphics. Four decades later the X Window System still works this way.<br />
<br />
RPCs imposed a performance penalty that made 3D games unusable. To allow, for example, a game to run in one window while a mail program ran in another we needed the currently active process to have direct access to the hardware, and if the operating system context-switched to a different graphics process, give that process direct access to the hardware. The operating system would need to save the first process' state from the graphics hardware, and restore the second process' state<br />
<br />
Our work on this problem at Sun led to a patent filed in 1989, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US5127098A/"><b>US5127098A</b></a>: <i>Method and apparatus for the context switching of devices</i> with (inventors David S. H. Rosenthal, Robert Rocchetti, Curtis Priem, and Chris Malachowsky). The idea was to have the device mapped into each process' memory but to use the system's memory management unit (MMU) ensure that at any one time all but one of the mappings was <i>invalid</i>. A process' access to an invalid mapping would interrupt into the system's page fault handler, which would invoke the device's driver to save the old process' context and restore the new process' context. The general problem with this idea is that, because the interrupt ends up in the page fault handler, it requires device-dependent code in the page fault handler. This is precisely the kind of connection between software and hardware that caused schedule problems at Sun.<br />
<br />
There were two specific Nvidia problems with this idea. First that Windows wasn't a virtual memory operating system so you couldn't do any of this. And second that even once Windows had evolved into a virtual memory operating system, Microsoft was unlikely to let us mess with the page fault handler.<br />

As you can see in Figure 6 of the <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US5805930A/">'930 patent</a>, the I/O architecture consisted of an interface between the PCI bus and an internal bus that could implement a number of different I/O devices. The interface provided a number of capabilities:<br />
<ul>
<li>It implemented the FIFO, sharing it among all the devices on the internal bus.</li>
<li>It implemented the DMA engine and its IOMMU, sharing it among all the devices on the internal bus.</li>
<li>Using a translation table, it allowed applications to connect to a specific device on the internal bus via the interface using a virtual name.</li>
<li>It ensured that only one application at a time could access the interface.</li>
</ul>
The difference between the PCI and PC/AT buses wasn't just that the data path grew from 16 to 32 bits, but also that the address bus grew from 24 to 32 bits. The address space was 256 times bigger, thus Nvidia's devices could occupy much more of it. We could implement many virtual FIFOs, so that each application could have a <i>valid</i> mapping to one of them. The device, <i>not the operating system</i>, would ensure that only one of the virtual FIFOs was mapped to the single physical FIFO. A process accessing a virtual FIFO that wasn't mapped to the physical FIFO would cause an interrupt, but this time the interrupt would go to the device's driver, not the page fault handler. The driver could perform the context switch, and re-assign the physical FIFO to the new virtual FIFO. It would also have to copy page table entries from the CPU's MMU into the IOMMU to reflect the placement of the new process' pages in physical memory. There would be no page fault so no knowledge of the device in the operating system's page fault handler.  As we wrote in the <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US5918050A/">'050 patent</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
the use of many identically-sized input/output device address spaces each assigned for use only by one application program allows the input/output addresses to be utilized to determine which application program has initiated any particular input/output write operation.
</blockquote>
Because applications each saw their own virtual FIFO, future chips could implement multiple physical FIFOs, allowing the virtual FIFO of more than one process to be assigned a physical FIFO, which would reduce the need for context switching.<br />

One of the great things about NeWS was that it was programmed in PostScript. We had figured out how to make PostScript <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">object-oriented</a>, homomorphic to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk">SmallTalk</a>. We organized objects in the window system in a class hierarchy with inheritance. This, for example, allowed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Hopkins">Don Hopkins</a> to implement <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/05/pie-menus.html">pie menus</a> for NeWS in such a way that any user could replace the traditional rectangular menus with pie menus. This was such fun that Owen Densmore and I used the same technique to <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US5187786A/en">implement object-oriented programming for the Unix shell</a>.<br />
<br />
At a time when PC memory maxed out at 640 megabytes, the fact that the PCI bus could address 4 gigabytes meant that quite a few of its address bits were surplus. So we decided to increase the amount of data shipped in each bus cycle by using some of them as data. IIRC NV1 used 23 address bits, occupying 1/512th of the total space. 7 of the 23 selected one of the 128 virtual FIFOs, allowing 128 different processes to share access to the hardware. We figured 128 processes was plenty.<br />

The remaining 16 address bits could be used as data. In theory the FIFO could be 48 bits wide, 32 from the data lines on the bus and 16 from the address lines, a 50% increase in bits per bus cycle. NV1 ignored the byte part of the address so the FIFO was only 46 bits wide.<br />
<br />
So we organized the objects in our I/O architecture in a class hierarchy, rooted at class CLASS. The first thing an application did was to invoke the <tt>enumerate()</tt> method on the object representing class CLASS. This returned a list of the names of all the instances of class CLASS, i.e. all the object types this instance of the architecture implemented. In this way capabilities of the device weren't wired in to the application. The application asked the device what its capabilities were. In turn, the application could invoke <tt>enumerate()</tt> on each of the instances of class CLASS in the list, which would get the application a list of the names of each of the instances of each class, perhaps <tt>LINE-DRAWER</tt>.Thus the application would find out rather than know <i>a priori</i> the names of all the resources (virtual objects) of all the different types that the device supported.<br />
<br />
The application could then create objects, instances of these classes, by invoking the <tt>instantiate()</tt> method on the class object with a 32-bit name for the newly created object. The interface was thus limited to 4B objects for each application. The application could then <tt>select()</tt> the named object, causing an interrupt if there was no entry for it in the translation table so the resource manager could create one. The 64Kbyte address space of each FIFO was divided into 8 8K "sub-areas". The application could <tt>select()</tt> an object in each, so it could operate on 8 objects at a time.  Subsequent writes to each sub-area were interpreted as method invocations on the selected object, the word offset from the base of each sub-area within the 8Kbyte space specifying the method and the data being the argument to the method. The interface thus supported 2048 different methods per object.<br />
<br />
In this way we ensured that all knowledge of the physical resources of the device was contained in the resource manager. It was the resource manager that implemented class CLASS and its instances. Thus it was that the resource manager controlled which instances of class CLASS (types of virtual object) were implemented in hardware, and which were implemented by software in the resource manager. It was possible to store the resource manager's code in read-only memory on the device's PCI card, inextricably linking the device and its resource manager. The only thing the driver for the board needed to be able to do was to route the device's interrupts to the resource manager.<br />
<br />
The importance of the fact that all an application could do was to invoke methods on virtual objects was that the application could not know whether the object was implemented in hardware or in the resource manager's software. The flexibility to make this decision at any time was a huge advantage. As Kim quotes <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/1473342305">Michael Hara as saying</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
This was the most brilliant thing on the planet. It was our secret sauce. If we missed a feature or a feature was broken, we could put it in the resource manager and it would work."
</blockquote>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
As you can see, NV1 was very far from the "<a href="https://www.editiongroup.com/us/insights/minimum-viable-product-guide-for-founders">minimal viable product</a>" beloved of today's VCs. Their idea is to get something into users' hands as soon as possible, then iterate rapidly based on their feedback. But what Nvidia's VCs did by giving us the time to develop a real chip architecture was to enable Nvidia, after the failure of the first product, to iterate rapidly based on the second. Iterating rapidly on graphics chips <i>requires</i> that applications not know the details of successive chip's hardware.<br />
<br />
I have been privileged in my career to work with extraordinarily skilled engineers. Curtis Priem was one, others included James Gosling, the late Bill Shannon, Steve Kleiman, and Jim Gettys. <a href="https://patents.google.com/?inventor=rosenthal,priem&amp;oq=inventor:+rosenthal+inventor:+priem">This search</a> returns 2 Sun patents and 19 Nvidia patents for which both Curtis Priem and I are named inventors.  Of the Nvidia patents, Curtis is the lead inventor on 9 and I am the lead inventor on the rest.  Most describe parts of the Nvidia architecture, combining Curtis' exceptional understanding of hardware with my understanding of operating systems to redefine how I/O should work.  I rate this architecture as my career best engineering. It was certainly the most impactful. Thank you, Curtis!<br />

date: 2025-05-20, from: Liam on Linux

Since I know there are some folks who read this but may not read my Register stuff.<br /><br />It's here:<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/lproven/usb-dos">https://github.com/lproven/usb-dos</a><br /><br />I added a &quot;Buy me a coffee&quot; tip jar effort. :-)<br /><br />I am considering updates. Robert Sawyer was kind enough to send a list of suggestions and I should act on them.<br /><br />I have also received requests for PC-Write. Copies are still out there.<br /><br />Any other writer-oriented apps that anyone would like to see, or other functionalty?<br /><br />I discovered the Reg editors did sneak in a mention on the end of this at the start of the year:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/23/svardos_drdos_reborn/">https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/23/svardos_drdos_reborn/</a><br /><br />I wrote up how I built it later:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/26/dos_distraction_free_writing/">https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/26/dos_distraction_free_writing/</a><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=95336" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments

## About showing the “open to work” badge

date: 2025-05-20, from: Chris Heilmann's blog

I just came across a post on X that stated &#8220;nothing makes me want to hire someone less than this&#8221;, with a picture of the &#8220;open to work&#8221; badge LinkedIn offers job seekers. This being X, I thought I answer using appropriate voice: This, albeit succinct, is not very enlightening, so let me elaborate&#8230; Like [&#8230;]

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-05-20, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/17/dewey.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I've been looking up all kinds of things now that my new Daytona search engine has access to my blogging going back to 1994. I just did a <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=mullenweg">search for Mullenweg</a>, and came up with this <a href="https://ma.tt/2006/04/feed-validator/">blog post</a> by Matt in 2006 about the Feed Validator. The clarity is remarkable, and he's of course right. The people running the validator were actually promoting Atom over RSS, and were trying to tilt the table towards Atom. The goal was <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=interop">interop</a>, not to give Google or IBM control of the syndication format of the open web. When you keep changing your mind about what to flag and what to pass you end up with a standard that's as murky as the tariff policy of the US in 2025. I think you have to assume that was the goal. They didn't like that RSS didn't fall apart when Atom came out. If there's no benefit in changing, people don't.

## DoorDash Hack

date: 2025-05-20, updated: 2025-05-20, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>A DoorDash driver <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/669140/doordash-driver-convicted-delivery-scam">stole</a> over $2.5 million over several months:</p>
<blockquote><p>The driver, Sayee Chaitainya Reddy Devagiri, placed expensive orders from a fraudulent customer account in the DoorDash app. Then, using DoorDash employee credentials, he manually assigned the orders to driver accounts he and the others involved had created. Devagiri would then mark the undelivered orders as complete and prompt DoorDash&#8217;s system to pay the driver accounts. Then he&#8217;d switch those same orders back to &#8220;in process&#8221; and do it all over again. Doing this &#8220;took less than five minutes, and was repeated hundreds of times for many of the orders,&#8221; writes the US Attorney&#8217;s Office...</p></blockquote>

## Andrew Hickey

date: 2025-05-19, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2tjsq6a4vn6pww2iva5qj23v">Andrew Hickey</a> whose <a href="https://500songs.com/podcast/">podcast</a> I support, also appears to be strongly against people using ChatGPT. </p>
<p>I am a programmer, so you might think I'd see it the same way because what I do is similar to what musicians and prose writers do in that I create "intellectual property" which can be easily copied.</p>
<p>But we have a different culture in software, we tend to by default share what we do and let other people use it. They're supposed to credit us, but people are selfish and greedy and they will tend to take whatever isn't bolted down, and it sucks, but you accept it.</p>
<p>What's funny is Hickey appears to have no clue how much he's benefited from this ethos. His success probably would not have been possible without some people thinking it's more important to create the medium he could use any way he saw fit, than to own one that would probably have kept him out.</p>
<p>Creating is not as linear as he appears to think, which so ironic because that's basically what his freaking podcast is about. He loves to say "no one did anything first" (paraphrasing) and that's basically the <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/09/09/onlyStealFromTheBest.html">same idea</a>.</p>
<p>And I don't doubt that the next big media invention, the next <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=podcasting">podcasting</a> perhaps, will benefit enormously from having ChatGPT available for the people developing it.</p>
<p>PS: This appeared earlier as a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lpjn22v22s2k">post</a> on Bluesky. And I wrote every freaking word, as I always do unless disclaimed.</p>

## The Real Cost of Chinese Open-Source AI

date: 2025-05-19, from: Om Malik blog

Don&#8217;t believe the Chinese AI open-source hype, warns good friend, Pete Warden. Their large language models come at a price — the models are programmed to deliberately obscure historical truths, he writes on his blog. He points out that this isn&#8217;t just censorship; it&#8217;s engineered misinformation at scale, baked into the foundation of future AI. Warden compares answers to the same query using different models to support his conclusions.

Here's a search for <a href="https://daytona.scripting.com/search?q=%22menu%20sharing%22">menu sharing</a> which was a technology we made on the Mac that allowed people to write menus of scripts in Frontier that appear inside other apps. Netscape supported it as did MSIE, Quark, Eudora and many others. It was kind of magical, esp when the apps themselves were scriptable (many of them were in the 90s). Next up, I'm going to import the home page of Scripting News from 1997 to 2010. It was mostly a linkblog then.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2025-05-18, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2018/10/15/knicks.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Not much to write, so impressed by the way the Knicks got past the Celtics. I don't know any Celtics fans, but I imagine there are some subscribers who are. Hard to imagine how hard the last series hit you all. I don't have anything against the Celtics these days although Paul Pierce is an asshole, and I hope you all know that. Just watched the OKC win over Denver. All around an incredible group in the final four, very diverse and inclusive. And btw now that I think of it, Jaylen Brown was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSu9DYgvn1E">grabbing</a> Knicks players by the balls. I hope you all come to terms with that. We do love Kristaps in New York, a true gentleman. Maybe he and Giannis can come play for the Nets. We may have room for another great team in NY.

## What an Unusual Week

date: 2025-05-18, from: Om Malik blog

It has been a week, that at best can be described as deliciously weird. I have neither been inspired to write, nor to indulge my passion for photography. Apart from necessary work, I have been out walking, and doing a lot of reading. And making notes for future writing projects. My brain is percolating, trying &#8230;
