## The NSA’s “Fifty Years of Mathematical Cryptanalysis (1937–1987)”

date: 2025-05-19, updated: 2025-05-19, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>In response to a FOIA request, the NSA released &#8220;<a href="https://www.governmentattic.org/58docs/NSA50YrsMathCrypt1988.pdf">Fifty Years of Mathematical Cryptanalysis (1937-1987)</a>,&#8221; by Glenn F. Stahly, with a lot of redactions.</p>
<p>Weirdly, this is the second time the NSA has declassified the document. John Young got a <a href="https://archive.org/details/NSAFiftyYearsOfMathematicalCryptanalyisis">copy</a> in 2019. This one has a few less redactions. And nothing that was provided in 2019 was redacted here.</p>
<p>If you find anything interesting in the document, please tell us about it in the comments.</p>

## Scrape wars

date: 2025-05-19, from: Paolo Valdemarin's blog

There’s a lot of scraping going on these days. It looks like most AI applications that need to access content online are resorting to scraping web pages. Many AI agents we’ve been working on rely on having some sort of access to online content. Of course, we started with a simple RSS aggregator: it’s clean, &#8230; <a href="https://val.demar.in/2025/05/scrape-wars/" class="more-link">Continue reading<span class="screen-reader-text"> "Scrape wars"</span></a>

## How iPhone has evolved as a Camera

date: 2025-05-19, from: Om Malik blog

Given how much I have been using my iPhone as my everyday camera, I decided to put together this blog post to show how far Apple&#8217;s smartphone camera technology has come. With WWDC 2025 coming up later this summer, I am interested in how much more Apple and its chip-wizards can cram into my daily &#8230;

Tonight, late on a Sunday night, the House Budget Committee passed what Republicans are calling their &#8220;Big, Beautiful Bill&#8221; to enact Trump&#8217;s agenda although it had failed on Friday when far-right Republicans voted against it, complaining it did not make deep enough cuts to social programs.

I don't know any Celtics fans, but I imagine there are some subscribers who are. Hard to imagine how hard the last series hit you all. I don't have anything against the Celtics these days although Paul Pierce is an asshole, and I hope you all know that. Just watched the OKC win over Denver. All around an incredible group in the final four, very diverse and inclusive. And btw now that I think of it, Jaylen Brown was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSu9DYgvn1E">grabbing</a> Knicks players by the balls. I hope you all come to terms with that. We do love Kristaps in New York, a true gentleman. Maybe he and Giannis can come play for the Nets. We may have room for another great team in NY.

## What an Unusual Week

date: 2025-05-18, from: Om Malik blog

It has been a week, that at best can be described as deliciously weird. I have neither been inspired to write, nor to indulge my passion for photography. Apart from necessary work, I have been out walking, and doing a lot of reading. And making notes for future writing projects. My brain is percolating, trying &#8230;
