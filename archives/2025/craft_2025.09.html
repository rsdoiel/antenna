<p>date: 2025-03-06, from: Lost Arg Press blog</p>
<p>Planning to join us for the Anthe Open House this Sunday (March 9)

<p>date: 2025-03-06, from: Lost Arg Press blog</p>
<p>If you hate oversharing, close this page now and go on your merry
way. Still here? OK – you’re about to read about what a wuss I am,
because with just one weekend’s exception (and it was probably a
mistake), my woodworking has been limited to reading, writing and

published in American Lutherie #108, 2011 I met Stan Werbin, owner of
Elderly Instruments in Lansing, Michigan, in 2009 at the Midwest Banjo

<p>Mending a Bomber by John Calkin Originally published in American
Lutherie #89, 2007 It’s probably inevitable that repairpeople develop an
affinity for certain instruments, and the reasons aren’t always
