her song-writing artistry, chiabiee turns to music to share personal
stories</h2>
<p>date: 2025-05-28, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>With each note sung and guitar chord strung, Chianie Chi’s melodic
tone echoes her love for music. The fourth-year linguistics and computer
science student said her love for music began at a young age as she grew
up watching singing competitions for fun with her family and recorded
voice memos of herself singing the songs she made.</p>
