<p>date: 2025-05-25, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>For about a week, residents of the University Cooperative Housing
Association didn’t need an alarm clock – they were roused by a rooster’s
crowing. The rooster, who was deemed “Baraaack” – after former president
Barack Obama – lived in a then-vacant lot near the co-op – a
student-led, nonprofit housing space – from April 6 to April 14.</p>
