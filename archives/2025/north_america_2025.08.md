## UN to vote on Russia-Ukraine war resolutions

date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA

A resolution drafted by the United States and another drafted by Ukraine and backed by the European Union calling for an end to the war in Ukraine are set for votes Monday at the United Nations.


The U.N. General Assembly is expected to vote on the Ukrainian resolution, followed by the U.S. resolution. The U.N. Security Council is expected to hold its own vote on the U.S. resolution later in the day.


The U.S. resolution calls for “a swift end to the conflict and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and the Russian Federation.”


The U.S.-drafted measure does not mention Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which began three years ago Monday.




U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Friday that the resolution would “affirm that this conflict is awful, that the U.N. can help end it, and that peace is possible.”


“This is our opportunity to build real momentum toward peace,” Rubio said in a statement.


The more extensive Ukrainian resolution says the Russian invasion “has persisted for three years and continues to have devastating and long-lasting consequences not only for Ukraine, but also for other regions and global stability.”


It calls for “a de-escalation, an early cessation of hostilities and a peaceful resolution of the war against Ukraine” and highlights the need for the war to end this year.


The Ukrainian draft says earlier resolutions adopted by the General Assembly need to be fully implemented, including those calling for Russia to fully withdraw from Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders.


General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, but they do carry the moral weight of the international community.


At the Security Council, a resolution needs the support of at least nine of the 15 members, with none of the permanent members—Britain, China, France, Russia, or United States—using their veto power. The U.S. measure is expected to have enough support Monday.


U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said during remarks Monday at the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva that countries “must spare no effort to bring an end to this conflict, and achieve a just and lasting peace in line with the U.N. Charter, international law and General Assembly resolutions.”


Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia is ready to negotiate with Ukraine and Europe, but will “stop hostilities only when these negotiations produce a firm and sustainable result that suits the Russian Federation.”


French President Emmanuel Macron is visiting the United States for talks Monday with President Donald Trump that are expected to include the war in Ukraine.




Macron said last week that he planned to tell Trump the U.S. leader “cannot be weak” in the face of Putin.


British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is due to visit Washington later this week for similar talks, and like Macron has emphasized the need for Ukraine’s sovereignty to be at the center of any peace effort.


A group of leaders including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, European Council President Antonio Costa, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez visited Kyiv on Monday in a show of support for Ukraine.




“We are in Kyiv today, because Ukraine is Europe,” von der Leyen said on X. “In this fight for survival, it is not only the destiny of Ukraine that is at stake. It’s Europe’s destiny.”


European Union foreign ministers on Monday approved a new round of sanctions against Russia, which EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said include measures against ships that work to evade restrictions on transporting certain goods, banks that circumvent sanctions and equipment used to pilot drones.




Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the new sanctions “entirely predictable,” and said the European nations seemed to want the war to continue.


Fighting continued Monday with Russia saying it shot down 23 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 16 over the Oryol region.


Ryazan Governor Pavel Malkov said falling debris from a downed Ukrainian drone caused a fire at an industrial enterprise.


Ukraine’s military said Monday it shot down 113 of the 185 drones that Russia used in overnight attacks.


Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.

## Trump says Dan Bongino to be FBI deputy director

date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said in a post on social media Sunday that Dan Bongino, a conservative talk show host, will be deputy director of the FBI.


Bongino will join Kash Patel, who was recently confirmed by the Senate as director of the FBI. Trump said Bongino was named to the role by Patel. The position does not require Senate confirmation.


"Great news for Law Enforcement and American Justice!" Trump posted on his social media network, Truth Social, calling Bongino "a man of incredible love and passion for our Country."


Bongino was previously a New York City police officer, and a member of the U.S. Secret Service. He most recently had been known as a conservative radio host and podcaster.


Trump said in his post that Bongino is "prepared to give up" his program as he steps into the new role. "The Dan Bongino Show" was most recently the 56th-ranked podcast in the United States, according to Spotify.

## 'Conclave' triumphs at SAG Awards, Timothee Chalamet wins best actor, upending Oscar predictions

date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA

The papal thriller "Conclave" won best ensemble and Timothee Chalamet took best actor at the 31st Screen Actors Guild Awards on Sunday, a pair of twists that added a few final wrinkles to an unusually unpredictable awards season.


In winning the guild's top award, Edward Berger's Vatican-set drama triumphed just as the Catholic Church was praying for the health of Pope Francis, who remained in critical condition Sunday after an asthmatic respiratory crisis. "Conclave" dramatizes the fictional election of a new pope. Earlier in the evening onstage, Isabella Rossellini shared the cast's best wishes for Pope Francis.


All the momentum going into the SAG Awards was with Sean Baker's "Anora," which had won with the producers, directors and writers guilds. Now, with "Conclave" winning with the actors and at the BAFTAs, what will nab best picture in a week's time at the Academy Awards is, again, anyone's guess.


"Wow," said "Conclave" star Ralph Fiennes taking the stage. "I've not been elected to speak. I've been designated to speak on behalf of our conclave, our ensemble."


That wasn't the only surprise in the ceremony held at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles and streamed lived by Netflix. Chalamet's best actor win upset "The Brutalist" star Adrien Brody and put the 29-year-old on course to possibly win his first Academy Award.


Chalamet looked visibly surprised when his name was announced at the ceremony. But once he reached the staged, the "A Complete Unknown" star spoke with composure and confidence.


"The truth is, this was 5 ½ years of my life," said Chalamet. "I poured everything I had into playing this incomparable artist, Mr. Bob Dylan, a true American hero. It was the honor of a lifetime playing him."


He then added: "The truth is, I'm really in pursuit of greatness. I know people don't usually talk like that, but I want to be one of the greats."


The other Oscar favorites — Demi Moore, Zoe Saldana and Kieran Culkin — all won. The SAG Awards are closely watched as an Oscar preview. Their picks don't always align exactly with those of the film academy, but they often nearly do.


The last three best ensemble winners — "Oppenheimer," "Everything Everywhere All at Once" and "CODA" — all went on to win best picture at the Oscars. All but one of the SAG acting winners of the last three years has also won the Oscar. (The sole exception was Lily Gladstone, who won SAG's award for female actor last year for "Killers of the Flower Moon," but the Oscar trophy went to Emma Stone for "Poor Things".)


Moore seemingly solidified her Oscar chances by following up her Golden Globe win for her performance in "The Substance." Moore, whose campaign was boosted by her speech about being pigeonholed a "popcorn actress," has traded awards with "Anora" breakthrough Mikey Madison.


"What we believe is so much more powerful than what we think," said Moore. "The saying, 'I'll believe it when I see it' — the reality is when I believe it, I will see it."


The SAG Awards unfolded against the backdrop of the aftermath of the devastating wildfires that began in early January. Those fires forced the guild to cancel its in-person nominations announcement and launch a disaster relief fund for SAG-AFTRA members affected. Host Kristen Bell introduced attending firefighters as "the most attractive tables" among a sea of stars.


Jane Fonda, 87, given the guild's Life Achievement Award, provided the evening with its most passionately political moment. Fonda, a famed activist, spoke indirectly about President Donald Trump's administration.


"We are in our documentary moment," said Fonda. "This is it. And it's not a rehearsal."


Fonda added that "woke just means you give a damn about other people."


"A whole lot of people are going to be hurt by what's happening, by what's coming our way," said Fonda. "We are going to need a big tent to resist what's coming at us."


Jean Smart, who had advocated for canceling award shows because of the wildfires, won best female actor in a comedy series for "Hacks." Smart didn't attend, but participated in a pre-taped introduction as her character, Deborah Vance.


Also not in attendance: Martin Short, though he upset Jeremy Allen White to win best male actor in a comedy series for "Only Murders in the Building." The Hulu series also won for best comedy ensemble.


"Wait, we never win. This is so weird," said Selena Gomez. "Marty and Steve (Martin) aren't here because, you know, they don't really care."


Colin Farrell won his first SAG award, for his performance in "The Penguin" and also became the first winner ever introduced, by Jamie Lee Curtis, as "the man who gave me COVID at the Golden Globes." Farrell bounded to the stage and promptly responded, "Guilty as charged," before blaming Brendan Gleeson for giving it to him.


The night's first televised award went to Culkin, who has won just about every award in the category for "A Real Pain." Gripping the SAG trophy, he could quickly tell the difference.


"It is funny that the heaviest of all awards is given by actors," said Culkin, who characteristically riffed his way through a rambling acceptance speech before swearing sincerity: "Believe it or not, this actually means a lot to me."


Netflix's "Emilia Perez," which has seen its awards hopes largely dashed by controversy over old tweets by lead actor Karla Sofia Gascon, took home the award for best female supporting actor, for Oscar favorite Saldana.


For Netflix's second time around streaming the awards, it inserted ads sporadically, like a traditional broadcast. Last year, downtimes were occupied by backstage interviews. Audio issues occasionally marred the broadcast, including brief interruptions of Fonda's speech.


After romps at the Emmys and Golden Globes, "Shogun" kept up its dominance. The FX series won best drama series ensemble, along with acting awards for Hiroyuki Sanada, Anna Sawai and for best stunt ensemble. The corresponding award for film went to the stunt performer ode "The Fall Guy."

## Kamala Harris receives prestigious Chairman's prize at NAACP Image Awards

date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA

Los Angeles — Former Vice President Kamala Harris stepped on the NAACP Image Awards stage Saturday night with a sobering message, calling the civil rights organization a pillar of the Black community and urging people to stay resilient and hold onto their faith during the tenure of President Donald Trump.


"While we have no illusions about what we are up against in this chapter in our American story, this chapter will be written not simply by whoever occupies the oval office nor by the wealthiest among us," Harris said after receiving the NAACP's Chairman's Award. "The American story will be written by you. Written by us. By we the people."


The 56th annual Image Awards was held at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in the Los Angeles area.


Harris, defeated by Trump in last year's presidential election, was the first woman and the first person of color to serve as vice president. She had previously been a U.S. senator from California and the state's attorney general.


In her first major public appearance since leaving office, Harris did not reference her election loss or Trump's actions since entering the Oval Office, although Trump mocked her earlier in the day at the Conservative Political Action Conference.


Harris spoke about eternal vigilance, the price of liberty, staying alert, seeking the truth and America's future.


"Some see the flames on our horizons, the rising waters in our cities, the shadows gathering over our democracy and ask 'What do we do now?'" Harris said. "But we know exactly what to do, because we have done it before. And we will do it again. We use our power. We organize, mobilize. We educate. We advocate. Our power has never come from having an easy path."


Other winners of the Chairman's prize have included former President Barack Obama, the late Rep. John Lewis and the late actor Ruby Dee.


NAACP Hall of Fame


Harris was honored during the ceremony along with the Wayans family. The family was inducted into the NAACP Image Awards Hall of Fame in recognition of pioneering contributions to film, TV, sketch and stand-up comedy that have shaped Hollywood for decades.


Keenen Ivory Wayans, Damon Wayans Sr., Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans, Kim Wayans and Damon Wayans Jr. each were recognized.


Marlon Wayans, whose guest appearance on Peacock's "Bel-Air" was up for an NAACP award, shared how Keenen Ivory Wayans sparked the family's rise.


"He raised us all like Jedis," he said. "We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for our big brother."


Marlon Wayans joked that when his brother told their mom he was leaving college for comedy, she said, "Boy, I've known you your whole life, and you ain't never said nothing funny. That's the funniest thing you've said."


The crowd erupted in laughter, a fitting tribute to a family that has kept audiences laughing for more than three decades.


The family has a long list of credits. Keenen Ivory Wayans created the sketch comedy series "In Living Color" in 1990 and directed the 2000 slasher spoof "Scary Movie," which was written by Marlon Wayans and Shawn Wayans, who also wrote and starred in "White Chicks" in 2004. Damon Wayan's had a starring role in the 1995 comedy "Major Payne," and currently co-stars with son Damon Wayans Jr. in the CBS sitcom "Poppa's House," which was nominated for an NAACP Award. The pair also were nominated for their acting on the show.


Damon Wayans Jr. has acted in two of the most critically acclaimed comedies in recent years: "Happy Endings" and "New Girl." Kim Wayans, a comedian, actor and director, also received praise for her work in the 2011 drama "Pariah."


Entertainer of the year


Keke Palmer expressed her surprise after her name was called as winner of the coveted entertainment of the year.


"Oh my gosh. Guys, I didn't think I was going to win," said Palmer, who paid homage to fellow nominee Cynthia Erivo's Oscar-nominated performance in "Wicked."


Palmer starred in the buddy comedy "One of Them Days," which debuted No. 1 at the box office last month. She also won an Emmy for her hosting efforts on NBC's "Password."


"It's such an amazing category to be in with all these people," Palmer said. "It's a beautiful night. It's Black History Month, y'all. It's so important we all come here together and celebrate one another with one another."


Other nominees included Kendrick Lamar, Kevin Hart and Shannon Sharpe.


Awards recognize LA residents impacted by wildfires


Image Awards host Deon Cole honored residents of the nearby Altadena neighborhood who were affected by January's devastating Los Angeles-area wildfires.


A video of the fire devastation played before actor Morris Chestnut took the stage.


"Homes were lost, stores destroyed, countless lives shattered and over two dozen souls gone forever," said Chestnut, a Los Angeles native who referenced impacted areas such as Altadena, the Pacific Palisades and Malibu.


"But what was not lost is the spirit of our community," said Chestnut, who noted 22 Altadena residents attended the show on Saturday. Many in the audience stood and applauded.


Cole shifted tone and brightened the mood with a comedic prayer for Kanye West's wife to find more clothes after her barely-there Grammys look and for Shannon Sharpe to finally size up his T-shirts.


The opening act was a lead-up to the evening's first award: Queen Latifah as best actress in a drama series for her role in "The Equalizer."


Chappelle honored


Dave Chappelle was honored with the President's Award for his "thought-provoking humor."


Accepting the award, Chappelle talked about the NAACP's push against negative portrayals of Black people in media and the importance of representation.


"Every opportunity we get, we just keep chipping away at this monster of a machine," he said.


Past recipients of the President's Award include Jay-Z, Lauryn Hill, Usher, Rihanna and John Legend.

## California governor asks Congress for nearly $40 billion for Los Angeles wildfire relief

date: 2025-02-24, from: VOA News USA

Sacramento, California — California Gov. Gavin Newsom has asked Congress to approve nearly $40 billion in aid to help the Los Angeles area recover from January's devastating wildfires, which he said could become the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history.


Newsom sent a letter Friday asking for support from lawmakers including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Rep. Tom Cole, the House Appropriations Committee chair.


"Los Angeles is one of the most economically productive places on the globe, but it can only rebound and flourish with support from the federal government as it recovers from this unprecedented disaster," Newsom wrote.


The total economic losses from the firestorm have been estimated to surpass $250 billion — with real estate losses from the Palisades and Eaton fires predicted to potentially top $30 billion, according to a Los Angeles Times analysis. More than 16,200 structures were destroyed as flames ripped through Pacific Palisades, Malibu, Pasadena and Altadena.


Newsom vowed that the funding would be used to rebuild homes, infrastructure, businesses, schools, churches and health care facilities, while supporting the needs of people affected by the devastation.


"Make no mistake, Los Angeles will use this money wisely," Newsom wrote.


His largest request is for an additional $16.8 billion from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, mostly intended for the rebuilding of property and infrastructure, with $5 billion earmarked for debris cleanup.


Newsom also asked for $9.9 billion from the Department of Housing and Urban Development for grants to fire victims, homeowners, businesses and renters, as well as $5.29 billion from the Small Business Administration for homeowner and business loans.


Newsom thanked President Donald Trump for support for fast-tracking debris removal. The letter did not mention recent threats by the Trump administration that federal aid could come with strings attached.


"We are eternally grateful," Newsom said.


Trump has been a frequent critic of Newsom and California's water policies. Ric Grenell, a Trump ally serving as his envoy for special missions, said Friday that "there will be conditions" to any federal aid for the state.


He said one of the possible conditions being discussed was defunding the California Coastal Commission, which regulates coastal development and protects public beach access. Trump has criticized the agency as overly restrictive, bureaucratic and a hindrance to timely rebuilding efforts.

## Trump administration fires 2,000 USAID workers, puts thousands of others on leave

date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The Trump administration said Sunday that it was placing all but a fraction of staffers at the U.S. Agency for International Development on leave worldwide and eliminating 2,000 U.S.-based staff positions.


The move was the latest and one of the biggest steps yet toward what President Donald Trump and cost-cutting ally Elon Musk say is their goal of gutting the six-decade-old aid and development agency in a broader campaign to slash the size of the federal government.


The move comes after a federal judge on Friday allowed the administration to move forward with its plan to pull thousands of USAID staffers off the job in the United States and around the world. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols rejected pleas in a lawsuit from employees to keep temporarily blocking the government's plan.


"As of 11:59 p.m. EST on Sunday, February 23, 2025, all USAID direct hire personnel, with the exception of designated personnel responsible for mission-critical functions, core leadership and/or specially designated programs, will be placed on administrative leave globally," according to the notices sent to USAID workers that were viewed by The Associated Press.


At the same time, the agency said it was beginning a reduction in force that would eliminate 2,000 U.S.-based staffers. That means many of the Washington-based staffers who are being placed on leave would soon have their positions eliminated.


The Trump appointee running USAID, deputy administrator Pete Marocco, has indicated he plans to keep about 600 mostly U.S.-based staffers on the job in the meantime, in part to arrange travel for USAID staffers and families abroad.


USAID and the State Department did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.


The move escalates a monthlong push to dismantle the agency, which has included closing its headquarters in Washington and shutting down thousands of aid and development programs worldwide following an effort to freeze all foreign assistance. Trump and Musk contend that USAID's work is wasteful and furthers a liberal agenda.


Lawsuits by government workers' unions, USAID contractors and others say the administration lacks the constitutional authority to eliminate an independent agency or congressionally funded programs without lawmakers' approval.


The Trump administration efforts upend decades of U.S. policy that aid and development work overseas serves national security by stabilizing regions and economies and building alliances, a critical tool of U.S. "soft power" for winning influence abroad.


The notices of firings and leaves come on top of hundreds of USAID contractors receiving no-name form letters of termination in the past week, according to copies that AP viewed.


The blanket nature of the notification letters to USAID contractors, excluding the names or positions of those receiving them, could make it difficult for the dismissed workers to get unemployment benefits, workers noted.


A different judge in a second lawsuit tied to USAID has temporarily blocked the foreign funding freeze and said this past week that the administration had kept withholding the aid despite his court order and must at least temporarily restore the funding to programs worldwide.

## Some US agencies tell workers not to reply to Musk's 'accomplishments email'

date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Multiple U.S. federal agencies told employees not to respond immediately to a demand by President Donald Trump's adviser Elon Musk to list their accomplishments in the last week or be fired, as a chaotic campaign to cull the bureaucracy pushes forward.


Trump administration-appointed officials at the FBI and State Department sent their staff emails telling them not to respond outside their chains of command, in a possible sign of tension between members of the Republican administration and the world's richest person in his campaign to cut down the government's 2.3 million-member civilian workforce.


"The FBI, through the office of the director, is in charge of all our review processes," said FBI Director Kash Patel, a Trump appointee, in an email to staff seen by Reuters.


Musk leads the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which in the first weeks of Trump's administration has laid off more than 20,000 workers and offered buyouts to another 75,000, across wide swaths of the government from the Defense Department — long a top Republican priority — to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, where all staff have been ordered to halt work.


The frantic pace has led the federal government in some cases to rush to rehire workers who perform critical functions like securing the nation's nuclear arsenal and trying to fight the worsening bird flu outbreak, which has caused egg prices to spike higher.


While there is bipartisan agreement that the U.S. government, which carries $36 trillion in debt, would benefit from reform, Musk's tumultuous approach has drawn widespread criticism, including from voters in some Republican areas.


Federal workers Saturday evening received an email instructing them to detail the work they did during the previous week by 11:59 p.m. ET on Monday (0459 GMT Tuesday), shortly after Musk posted on his X social media site that failing to respond would be taken as a resignation.


The subject of the email read, "What did you do last week?" and came from a human resources address in the Office of Personnel Management, but did not include Musk's threat of termination.


Workers at the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Education and Commerce, as well as at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Institutes of Health and the Internal Revenue Service also were told not to respond, pending further guidance, according to sources and emails reviewed by Reuters.


"To be clear — this is irregular, unexpected, and warrants further validation," a senior executive at the National Centers for Environmental Information, an agency that manages environmental data and is part of the Commerce Department, wrote.


Some officials welcomed the move. Ed Martin, Trump's nominee for U.S. Attorney in Washington, D.C., who is serving in an interim capacity, praised Musk and DOGE in an email response.


But other offices within the Justice Department, including the executive office that supports all U.S. attorneys and the department's civil division, told employees not to reply, pending additional information.


Employees at the Drug Enforcement Administration, part of the Justice Department, were told to respond, according to an email seen by Reuters.


Union questions Musk's authority


The largest federal workers' union, the American Federation of Government Employees, wrote on X on Sunday that it did not believe Musk had the authority to fire employees who did not respond and would formally request that OPM rescind the message.


Meanwhile, the union advised members to ask their supervisors directly whether to reply and to follow their guidance.


The email left some employees even more frustrated and worried after weeks of uncertainty about their futures.


"I really wonder when someone is going to say enough," one IRS employee told Reuters.


Media offices at the Commerce, Justice, Education and Treasury departments, as well as at the FDIC and NIH, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. An FBI spokesperson declined to comment, and a State Department spokesperson referred questions to the White House.


Musk on X on Sunday called the email "a very basic pulse check."


Senator John Curtis, a Republican from Utah, said he supports the Trump administration's efforts to reduce government spending, but that Musk should take a more humane approach.


"If I could say one thing to Elon Musk, it's please put a dose of compassion in this," Curtis said on CBS News' "Face the Nation."


"These are real people. These are real lives. These are mortgages. It's a false narrative to say we have to cut, and you have to be cruel to do it as well."


Some federal judiciary employees, including judges, also received the Saturday email from OPM, even though the court system is not part of the executive branch, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts confirmed.


The judiciary advised employees that no action should be taken in response to the message, according to an email reviewed by Reuters.


In some cases, employees were left unsure how to respond even if they chose to do so.


Some lawyers, for instance, expressed concern that their work is confidential.


Workers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also received the email, according to people with knowledge of the matter, even though they were all ordered to cease working since early this month, leaving them with little to do.

## Hegseth defends Trump's firings of Pentagon leaders, says more may be to come

date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth insists President Donald Trump 's abrupt firing of the nation's senior military officer amid a wave of dismissals at the Pentagon wasn't unusual and he suggested more firings could come.


"Nothing about this is unprecedented," Hegseth told "Fox News Sunday" about Air Force Gen. CQ Brown Jr. being removed Friday night as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. "The president deserves to pick his key national security advisory team."


Hegseth said "there are lots of presidents who made changes" citing former commanders in chief, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, George H.W. Bush and Barack Obama. Obama, Hegseth said, "fired or dismissed hundreds" of military officials.


Months into his first term, Obama removed Army Gen. David McKiernan from being commander of the U.S. forces in Afghanistan. However, Trump, while running for his second term, vowed to eradicate "woke" ideologies from the military and to swiftly dismiss many top leaders.


Hegseth and Trump have made no secret about focusing on pushing aside military officers who have supported diversity, equity and inclusion in the ranks. The administration says the move will better fortify a lethal fighting force.


Brown was just the second Black general to serve as chairman. His 16 months in the post were consumed with the war in Ukraine and the expanded conflict in the Middle East. Trump in 2020 nominated Brown as Air Force's chief of staff.


Trump wants to replace Brown with Air Force Lt. Gen. Dan "Razin" Caine, who retired in December. It is unclear what recalling Caine to active-duty service will require. The position requires Caine to be confirmed by the Senate.


Hegseth said Friday's dismissals affected six three- and four-star generals and were "a reflection of the president wanting the right people around him to execute the national security approach we want to take."


He called Brown "honorable" but said he is "not the right man for the moment," without citing specific deficiencies. After the 2020 murder of George Floyd, Brown in a video spoke of his experience as a Black pilot, apparently making him fodder for the Trump administration's wars against inclusion initiatives in the military.


Of Caine, Hegseth said that Trump "respects leaders who untie the hands of war fighters in a very dangerous world."


Retired Gen. George Casey called the firings "extremely destabilizing." Casey, who was Republican President George W. Bush's commander of the U.S. and multinational forces in Iraq from 2004 to 2007, also noted that the Trump administration can change Pentagon policy without changing personnel, but added, that what happened is "within the president's prerogative."


"That's his prerogative," Casey told ABC's "This Week." "He is the commander in chief of the armed forces."


Still, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee told ABC that the firings were "completely unjustified" and that "apparently, what Trump and Hegseth are trying to do is to politicize the Department of Defense."


Hegseth was also asked on Fox News about officials potentially compiling lists of more defense officials they plan to fire. He said there was no list but suggested that more dismissals could indeed be coming.


"We have a very keen eye towards military leadership and their willingness to follow lawful order," Hegseth said. "Joe Biden gave lawful orders. A lot of them are really bad," he said, adding that things like COVID vaccine mandates "eroded" the military ideologically


"President Trump has given another set of lawful orders and they will be followed," Hegseth said. "If they're not followed then those officers will find the door."

## American Airlines flight from New York to Delhi lands safely in Rome after security concern

date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA

Rome, Italy — An American Airlines flight from New York to New Delhi, India, landed safely in Rome on Sunday afternoon after it was diverted due to a security concern , which later proved to be "non-credible," the airline said. 


American Airlines said Flight 292 "was inspected by law enforcement" after landing at Leonardo da Vinci International Airport and "cleared to re-depart." 


It didn't clarify the cause of the security concern, but added an inspection was required by protocol before the flight could land in New Delhi. 


"The flight will stay in Rome overnight to allow for required crew rest before continuing to Delhi as soon as possible tomorrow," the airline said. 


An Associated Press reporter filmed two fighter jets flying over the airport shortly before the unscheduled landing. Fire trucks were visible on the landing strip on one side of the plane after it landed. 


The airport continued to operate normally, a spokesman with Rome's airport said.

## 'Captain America' dives in 2nd weekend, 'The Monkey' boosts Neon's successes

date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA

New York — “Captain America: Brave New World” soared on opening weekend but crashed down in its second go-around with audiences. 


“Brave New World,” the latest sign that the Marvel machine isn’t quite what it used to be, remained No. 1 at the box office in its second frame with $28.2 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. But after a debut of $100 million over four days and $88 million over three days, that meant a steep drop of 68%. 


While blockbusters often see significant slides in their second weekends, only two previous MCU titles have fallen off so fast: 2023’s “The Marvels,” which fell 78%, and 2023’s “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” which dropped 70%. 


The Anthony Mackie-led “Captain America” installment has been slammed by critics, and audiences also have graded it poorly, with a “B-” CinemaScore. “Brave New World,” which fans had hoped would right the Marvel ship, has been largely met as another example of a once impenetrable brand struggling to recapture its pre- “Avengers: Endgame” aura of invincibility. 


Still, “Brave New World” has quickly grossed $289.4 million worldwide, with international sales nearly reaching $150 million. And with few big-budget offerings arriving in theaters in the coming weeks, it will have scant competition through much of March. 


The biggest new release of the weekend was Oz Perkins’ “The Monkey,” the director’s follow-up to his 2024 horror hit, “Longlegs.” Adapted from a Stephen King short story, “The Monkey” opened with $14.2 million for Neon, the second-best debut for the indie distributor. The best? “Longlegs,” which launched with $22.4 million. 




Neon had much to celebrate over the weekend. Its top awards contender, “Anora,” by Sean Baker, continues to gather momentum into next Sunday's Academy Awards. The best-picture favorite added wins at the Independent Spirit Awards on Saturday. 


Perkins, Neon and Blumhouse, which partnered in the release of “The Monkey,” have found a productive low-budget collaboration, with more on the way. Even if “The Monkey” doesn’t reach the heights of “Longlegs” ($126.9 million globally), Perkins and Neon return with “Keeper” this October. 


“The Monkey,” starring Tatiana Maslany and Theo James, revolves around an old monkey toy found in an attic. Reviews have been good (77% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), though audiences were less impressed, giving it a C+ CinemaScore. Horror films, though, typically grade low. 


As it did with “Longlegs,” Neon leaned into cryptic promotion for “The Monkey,” along with some macabre marketing. A funeral premiere was held at Los Angeles’ Immanuel Presbyterian Church, and fan screenings took place at the Hollywood Cemetery. The film, produced by James Wan, cost $10 million to make. 


Lionsgate’s “The Unbreakable Boy” opened with a paltry $2.5 million in 1,687 theaters. The Christian-themed Jon Gunn-directed film starring Zachary Levi and Meghann Fahy, is about parents who learn their son is autistic and has brittle bone disease. 


“Paddington in Peru,” the third installment of the marmalade-mad bear, fell to third place in its second weekend. It grossed $6.5 million in 3,890 locations, bringing its two-week total to $25.2 million. “Paddington in Peru” has been most popular overseas, where its collected $150 million thus far. 


“Ne Zha 2,” the animated Chinese juggernaut, took in $3.1 million from 800 theaters in its second weekend. In China, the sequel has grossed $1.7 billion this month, setting numerous box-office records. Those totals put "Ne Zha 2" past “Inside Out 2” ($1.66 billion) as the highest grossing animated film ever. 


Top 10 movies by domestic box office 


With final domestic figures releasing Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. 


1. “Captain America: Brave New World," $28.2 million. 


2. “The Monkey,” $14.2 million. 


3. “Paddington in Peru,” $6.5 million. 


4. “Dog Man,” $5.9 million. 


5. “Ne Zha 2,” $3.1 million. 


6. “Heart Eyes,” $2.9 million. 


7. “Mufasa: The Lion King,” $2.5 million. 


8. “The Unbreakable Boy,” $2.5 million. 


9. “Chhaava,” $1.5 million. 


10. “One of Them Days,” $1.4 million.

## Washington, Kyiv headed toward deal for Ukrainian 'critical minerals' rights

date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA

The United States and Ukraine said Sunday they are heading toward an agreement for Kyiv to give Washington a large share of its rare earth mineral rights as compensation for the billions of dollars in munitions the U.S. sent to Ukraine to defend itself from Russia’s full-scale war.


Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told a news conference in Kyiv that Ukraine and the U.S. are “making progress” in reaching a deal. He said a draft of the pact calls for Ukraine to pay the U.S. $2 for each dollar in aid the U.S. has sent to Kyiv to fight Russia’s invasion, although details of the would-be agreement have not been disclosed.


Zelenskyy called for security guarantees for Ukraine as part of any deal and said he wants better financial terms. “I don’t want something that 10 generations of Ukrainians will have to pay back,” he said.


The war hits the three-year mark on Monday.


Watch related report by Veronica Balderas Iglesias:




The U.S. has been Ukraine’s biggest benefactor, sending $128 billion in military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, according to Germany’s Kiel Institute for the World Economy. The U.S. share is just ahead of the combined $124 billion figure for the 27-nation European Union.


U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff told CNN’s “State of the Union” that he expects Zelenskyy will sign the minerals deal this week.




Zelenskyy at first rejected the U.S. demand for half of Ukraine’s rare earth mineral supplies, which are used in the production of technology products. Witkoff signaled in the CNN interview that the deal will now be completed although he did not spell out details of the agreement.


Witkoff said that European countries made their contributions to Ukraine’s war efforts after reaching agreement with Kyiv to eventually be paid back, but the U.S. had no such understanding.


Witkoff said such U.S. support for Ukraine with no repayment terms made “no sense” to President Donald Trump, a long-time New York real estate deal maker before entering politics in 2015.


Zelenskyy said, "I had an agreement with [former U.S. President Joe] Biden and American Congress, I am grateful to the Congress, to the both parties. And it was support by providing grants. Grant is not a loan. And we don't have to return the loan here. Maybe someone does not like it and thinks that it's unjust. Maybe. I don't know. But here is what this deal was about. It was grant. Therefore, it's not about the figure. We simply don't see it as a loan."


Trump, who last week called Zelenskyy a “dictator” and accused him of starting the war even though Russia invaded Ukraine, has demanded the repayments and blamed his predecessor, Biden, for not securing some form of compensation guarantee.


Zelenskyy said Sunday he wants Trump to "understand" his position and come through with concrete security guarantees to help Kyiv defend itself against the Russian invasion.


"I want very much from Trump understanding of each other," Zelenskyy said at his news conference, adding: "Security guarantees from Trump are much needed."


Zelenskyy said he was willing to give up his presidency if it meant peace in Ukraine, quipping that he could exchange his departure for Ukraine's entry into NATO, which Russia is adamantly opposed to.


"If [it means] peace for Ukraine, if you really need me to leave my post, I am ready," Zelenskyy said. "I can exchange this for NATO [membership], if that condition is there, immediately."


The top U.S. and Russian diplomats, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, met in Saudi Arabia without either Ukrainian or European officials last week to lay the groundwork for peace talks to end the war. Zelenskyy complained about Ukraine being excluded from the talks, but Trump said he could have negotiated with Russia beforehand to talk Moscow out of invading.


“I’ve had very good talks with Putin, and I’ve had not such good talks with Ukraine,” Trump told U.S. state governors at the White House.


“They don’t have any cards, but they play it tough,” Trump said of Ukraine.


Russian state television said in recent days that Trump’s view of the Russia-Ukraine conflict is “in total alignment with the way we see things.”


Witkoff said the war “wouldn’t have had to happen” if Ukraine hadn’t been pushing at the time for membership in NATO. Kyiv is still pressing to join the 32-nation pact, but Washington says it is unrealistic for that to happen as part of a negotiated peace settlement to end the war.


Witkoff said that eventually “you’ll see concessions signed by both sides” in a peace deal.


Russia now controls about one-fifth of the internationally recognized Ukrainian territory, with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov saying Sunday Moscow has no intention of yielding any of the land back to the Kyiv government.


"The people decided to join Russia a long time ago," he said, referring to Moscow-staged votes in eastern Ukraine held amid the three-year offensive that were assailed as bogus by Kyiv, the West and international monitors.


"No one will ever sell off these territories,” Peskov said. “That's the most important thing."




A Trump call with Putin two weeks ago set the stage for the Rubio-Lavrov talks in Saudi Arabia.  


"This is a dialogue between two extraordinary presidents," Peskov told state TV.  


Meanwhile, Zelenskyy said Russia launched 267 overnight drone attacks on Ukraine, which he condemned as "aerial terror." Ukrainian officials reported damage in five regions of the country.  


Zelenskyy said that in the past week, Russia has targeted Ukraine with nearly 1,150 attack drones, more than 1,400 guided aerial bombs and 35 missiles of various types.

## Kremlin hails Putin-Trump dialogue as promising

date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA

Moscow — The Kremlin on Sunday hailed dialogue between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin — two "extraordinary" presidents — as "promising," and vowed it would "never" give up territory seized in eastern Ukraine.


Trump broke with Western policy earlier this month by phoning Putin to discuss how to end the conflict in Ukraine — a call hailed by Moscow as ending three years of isolation for the Kremlin leader since he launched his full-scale offensive in February 2022.


Top Russian and U.S. officials then met in Saudi Arabia last week to discuss a "restoration" of ties and start a discussion on a possible ceasefire — all without the involvement of Kyiv or Europe.


"This is a dialogue between two extraordinary presidents," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state TV on Sunday.


"That's promising," he added.


"It is important that nothing prevents us from realizing the political will of the two heads of state."


Trump's overtures to Moscow have triggered alarm in Kyiv and across Europe.


But it is unclear whether his moves will be able to bring Moscow and Kyiv closer to a truce.


Peskov on Sunday ruled out any territorial concessions as part of a settlement.


"The people decided to join Russia a long time ago," he said, referring to Moscow-staged votes in eastern Ukraine held amid the offensive that were slammed as bogus by Kyiv, the West and international monitors.


"No one will ever sell off these territories. That's the most important thing."




'God willed it'


Putin said God and fate had entrusted him and his army with "the mission" to defend Russia.


"Fate willed it so, God willed it so, if I may say so. A mission as difficult as it is honorable — defending Russia — has been placed on our and your shoulders together," he told servicemen who have fought in Ukraine.


Russia was on Sunday marking Defender of the Fatherland Day — a holiday hailing soldiers and veterans — a day before the three-year anniversary of the start of its full-scale offensive.


"Today, at the risk of their lives and with courage, they are resolutely defending their homeland, national interests and Russia's future," Putin said in a video released by the Kremlin.


Moscow's army had overnight launched a record 267 attack drones at Ukraine, Kyiv's air force said.


Among them, 138 were intercepted by air defense and 119 were "lost."


Ukraine did not say what happened to the remaining 10 but a separate armed forces statement on Telegram said several regions, Kyiv included, had been "hit."


AFP journalists in the Ukrainian capital heard air defense systems in operation throughout the night.


'Inappropriate remarks'


Amid his outreach to Moscow, Trump has also verbally attacked Ukraine's leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy falsely claiming Kyiv started the war and that Zelenskyy was hugely unpopular at home.


The bitter war of words has threatened to undermine Western support for Kyiv at a critical juncture in the conflict.


Zelenskyy on Sunday called for the Western coalition that has been helping Kyiv fend off the Russian offensive for the last three years to hold strong.


"We must do our best to achieve a lasting and just peace for Ukraine. This is possible with the unity of all partners: we need the strength of the whole of Europe, the strength of America, the strength of all those who want lasting peace," Zelenskyy said on Telegram.


Moscow has reveled in the spat between Trump and Zelenskyy.


"Zelenskyy makes inappropriate remarks addressed to the head of state. He does it repeatedly," Peskov said Sunday.


"No president would tolerate that kind of treatment. So his [Trump's] reaction is completely quite understandable."




Scrambling to respond to Trump's dramatic policy reversal, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will travel to Washington next week to make the case for supporting Ukraine.

## New FBI Director Patel will also be named acting head of firearms agency, official says

date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — New FBI Director Kash Patel is expected to be named the acting head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, a Justice Department official said Saturday.


Patel could be sworn in next week, the official said, putting Patel in charge of two of the Justice Department's largest agencies in an unusual arrangement that raises questions about the future of the bureau that has long drawn the ire of conservatives.


The Justice Department official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the move before it's announced publicly. White House officials didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday evening.


Patel was sworn in Friday as FBI director after winning Senate approval despite Democrats' concerns about the steadfast Trump ally's plans to radically overhaul the FBI.


ATF is a separate agency with about 5,500 employees and is responsible for enforcing the nation's laws around firearms, explosives and arson. Among other things, it's in charge of licensing federal firearms dealers, tracing guns used in crimes and analyzing intelligence in shooting investigations.


The move was first reported Saturday by ABC News.


The news comes days after Attorney General Pam Bondi fired the ATF's top lawyer. Bondi said in a Fox News interview Friday that she fired chief counsel Pamela Hicks because the agency was "targeting gun owners." Hicks, who spent more than 20 years as a Justice Department lawyer, said in a social media post that being ATF chief counsel was the "highest honor" of her career.


Conservatives have long railed against ATF over its role in regulating firearms and have suggested shuttering the agency. Under the Biden administration, the ATF advanced new regulations aimed at cracking down on ghost guns and requiring thousands more firearms dealers to run background checks on buyers at gun shows or other places outside brick-and-mortar stores.


In an executive order earlier this month, President Donald Trump directed the attorney general to review all actions taken by the Biden administration around firearms "to assess any ongoing infringements of the Second Amendment rights of our citizens."


Gun safety groups have raised alarm about putting Patel in charge of the FBI, with gun control group Brady calling him a "known gun rights extremist." Gun Owners of America, a gun rights group, called his confirmation as FBI director "a major victory for gun owners and constitutional rights advocates nationwide."


The last confirmed ATF director was Steve Dettelbach, a former federal prosecutor, who led the agency from July 2022 until last month. He was the first confirmed director since 2015 as both Republican and Democratic administrations failed to get nominees through the politically fraught process.

## Pakistan threatens to deport Afghans if US relocation timeline isn’t met

date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA

ISLAMABAD — Pakistan has warned that thousands of Afghan nationals awaiting relocation and resettlement in the United States will be deported to Afghanistan if their cases are rejected or not processed on time.


Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar issued the warning during a television interview aired Saturday, noting that the U.S. has promised to relocate the Afghan community in question from Pakistan "tentatively around September this year." His office in Islamabad released the interview excerpts.


"If any refugee who was undertaken to be taken by another country after due process —no matter the timeline — if it doesn’t happen and the country refuses, then for us, that will be an illegal immigrant in Pakistan, and we might be forced to send such refugee back to [their] original country, which is Afghanistan," Dar told Turkey’s TRT national broadcaster.


However, the chief Pakistani diplomat expressed Islamabad’s willingness to resolve the issue with Washington, stating that his government is "examining the situation and will negotiate [accordingly]."


Last month, U.S. President Donald Trump halted refugee applications and travel plans until further notice to ensure that refugee entry into the United States aligns with its national interests.


The decision has stranded around 45,000 Afghans prepared to fly out of Afghanistan and at least 15,000 qualified refugees currently in Pakistan, according to #AfghanEvac, a coalition that assists Afghans with their relocation and resettlement in the U.S.


These individuals were part of Afghan families who fled their country following the Taliban insurgents’ retaking of power in 2021, primarily seeking refuge from potential retribution because of their affiliations with the U.S. and NATO forces during their nearly two-decade-long presence in Afghanistan.


While about 80,000 of these Afghans have since been relocated from Pakistan, officials in Islamabad assert that around 40,000 remain in a state of limbo including around 15,000 in Pakistan destined for the United States.


Since launching a crackdown on undocumented foreign migrants in September 2023, Pakistan has forcibly repatriated more than 825,000 undocumented Afghan refugees to their home country, according to the United Nations.


The government has recently intensified its crackdown, targeting both documented and undocumented Afghan refugees.


Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ordered authorities last month to remove all Afghans from Islamabad and the adjoining city of Rawalpindi by Feb. 28 before arranging for deporting them to Afghanistan along with others subsequently. The targeted population encompasses over 2.5 million Afghans nationwide, comprising lawful refugees, documented economic migrants, and those without legal authorization to remain in Pakistan.


Sharif’s directive stipulates March 31 as the deadline for the United States and other countries to process the cases of Afghans awaiting resettlements, thereby preventing their deportation.

## Macron, Starmer to meet Trump, offer ideas for Ukraine security guarantees

date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA

LONDON/PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will travel to Washington next week amid alarm in Europe over U.S. President Donald Trump's hardening stance toward Ukraine and overtures to Moscow on the three-year conflict.


The leaders of Europe's two nuclear powers, who will be traveling separately, are expected to try to persuade Trump not to rush into a ceasefire deal with Vladimir Putin at any cost, keep Europe involved and discuss military guarantees to Ukraine.


Macron, who is trying to capitalize on a relationship with Trump built during their first presidential terms, has said agreeing to a bad deal that would amount to a capitulation of Ukraine would signal weakness to the United States' foes, including China and Iran.


"I will tell him: deep down you cannot be weak in the face of President (Putin). It's not you, it's not what you're made of and it's not in your interests," he said in an hourlong question and answer session on social media ahead of Monday's visit to the White House.


The visits come amid a rift between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom Trump described as a "dictator." That has alarmed Kyiv's European allies, already reeling from a more aggressive U.S. posture on trade, diplomacy and even domestic European politics.


Philip Golub, a professor in international relations at the American University in Paris, said Trump's rapid-fire moves in his first weeks in office, as well as the rhetoric from other U.S. officials, had been a major shock for the Europeans.


"They could not have expected that somehow within the United States would emerge this ultra-nationalist coalition of forces that would actually challenge Europe's voice in world affairs in such a stark and strong way," he told Reuters.


He said Macron believed he had a "historic role to play" in going to Washington to ensure Europe can weigh in on the ultimate negotiations on Ukraine. "Whether he can actually achieve something, however, in this visit is an entirely different matter," he added.




Starmer, who has also warned the end of the war cannot be a "temporary pause before Putin attacks again," will be in Washington on Thursday.


Speaking on a Fox News podcast on Friday, Trump said Macron and Starmer had not "done anything" to end the war. "No meetings with Russia!" he said, although he described Macron as "a friend of mine" and Starmer as "a very nice guy."


However, the two countries are keen to show Trump they are ready to take on a bigger burden for European security.


Britain and France are firming up ideas with allies for military guarantees for Ukraine and their two leaders will seek to persuade Trump to provide U.S. assurances in any post ceasefire deal, Western officials said.


Their respective militaries began initial planning last summer for the post-war scenario, but the discussions accelerated in November after Trump secured the U.S. presidency, a French military official and two diplomats said.


They have also been supported in putting together an array of options by countries like Denmark and the Baltic states as Europeans discuss what they would be ready to do should there be an accord and peacekeepers required, officials said.


While both Britain and France have ruled out sending troops to Ukraine immediately, the plans, still in concept stage, center around providing air, maritime, land and cyber support that would aim to deter Russia from launching any future attacks, Western officials said.


Air and sea assets could be based in Poland or Romania, restoring safe international air space and ensuring the Black Sea remained safe for international shipping, the official said.


Part of the British and French talks center around the possibility of sending European peacekeepers. While U.S. boots on the ground may not be necessary, deterrence in the form of U.S. medium-range missiles and ultimately nuclear weapons will remain crucial.


The options being discussed would center not on providing troops for the frontline or the 2,000-kilometer border which would remain secured by Ukrainian forces, but further to the West, three European diplomats and the military official said.


Those troops could be tasked with protecting key Ukrainian infrastructure such as ports or nuclear facilities to reassure the Ukrainian population. However, Russia has made it clear it would oppose a European presence in Ukraine.


A French military official said there was little sense in talking numbers at this stage because it would depend on what was finally agreed, what international mandate was given and whether non-European troops would also be involved.


"It's not about the numbers of troops in Ukraine. It's the ability to mobilize and the ability to arrange everything into a package of interoperability units," the French official said.


A Western official said that even 30,000 troops could be on the "high side."

## Musk orders US federal workers to describe what they did at work last week or get fired

date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Elon Musk, the billionaire head of the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), threatened Saturday to fire any federal worker who fails to explain what work they have accomplished during the previous week. 


The threat, issued in a post on the social media site X, was made just hours after President Donald Trump posted on his own social media network Truth Social that DOGE should get more aggressive in its attempts to downsize and reshape the federal workforce. 


"All federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week," Musk posted on X. "Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation." 


As of Saturday evening, emails were sent to employees at federal agencies including the Securities and Exchange Commission, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others with the subject line, "What did you do last week?" 


The email, seen by Reuters, asks employees to reply to the email they have received with five bullet points summarizing "what you accomplished at work last week" and copy their managers. 


The email sent from a human resources address gives employees until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on Monday to respond. 


It is unclear what legal basis Musk has to terminate federal workers if they fail to respond to his request. 


Workers at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also received the email Saturday, according to people with knowledge of the matter. However, most agency staff had been ordered not to perform any tasks since early this month, creating a conundrum. The agency is also under a temporary court order not to resume mass firings pending the outcome of legal proceedings. 


A spokesperson for DOGE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 


The AFGE, the union representing federal employees, said in a statement it will challenge any "unlawful terminations."  


"Once again, Elon Musk and the Trump administration have shown their utter disdain for federal employees and the critical services they provide to the American people," said AFGE National President Everett Kelley.  


The Trump administration's fast-paced and controversial process to reduce government spending by shrinking the federal workforce led by Musk and his young aides at the cost-cutting DOGE has led to haphazard firings that resulted in numerous mistakes and forced several agencies to quickly rehire vital employees, such as those working on nuclear safety, defense and power generation. 


The first wave of job cuts has targeted workers who are easier to fire, such as employees on the job for less than two years or those who have started new roles within an agency. 


The indiscriminate firings have led to DOGE terminating people whose jobs are not funded by taxpayers and have begun to anger people across the country who are concerned about a loss of services as well as the impact of federal job losses on local economies. 


Trump has repeatedly talked about Musk as the functional leader of DOGE, which is not a Cabinet-level department, but the White House said in a court filing earlier this month that Musk had no authority over DOGE and was not an employee of the program.

## Officer killed after gunman takes hostages at Pennsylvania hospital

date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA

YORK, PENNSYLVANIA  — A man armed with a pistol and carrying zip ties entered a Pennsylvania hospital's intensive care unit Saturday and took staff members hostage before he was killed by police in a shootout that also left an officer dead, authorities said.


Three workers at UPMC Memorial Hospital, including a doctor, a nurse and a custodian, and two other officers were shot and wounded in the attack, York County District Attorney Tim Barker said. A fourth staffer was injured in a fall.


Gunfire erupted after officers went to engage the shooter, whom Barker identified as Diogenes Archangel-Ortiz, 49. He said Archangel-Ortiz was holding at gunpoint a female staff member who had her hands bound with zip ties when police opened fire.


"This is a huge loss to our community," Barker said at a news conference following the shooting. "It is absolutely clear, and beyond any and all doubt, that the officers were justified in taking their action using deadly force."


Barker added that while the investigation is in its early stages, it appears Archangel-Ortiz had previous contact with the hospital's ICU earlier in the week for "a medical purpose involving another individual" and he intentionally targeted the workers there.


No one answered the door Saturday at an address in York believed to be that of Archangel-Ortiz.


The officer who died was identified as Andrew Duarte of the West York Borough Police Department.


"We all have broken hearts and are grieving at his loss," West York Borough Manager Shawn Mauck told The Associated Press.




Duarte was a law enforcement veteran who joined the department in 2022 after five years with the Denver Police Department, according to his LinkedIn profile. He described receiving a "hero award" in 2021 from Mothers Against Drunk Driving for his work in impaired driving enforcement for the state of Colorado.


"I have a type A personality and like to succeed in all that I do," his LinkedIn profile said.


Duarte also worked as a patrol officer in Denver, was highly regarded for his work and was close friends with other officers, the department there said in a statement.


At a makeshift memorial on the front steps of the West York Borough Police Department, Linda Shields dropped off roses Saturday and dabbed tears as she thought of her son, a police officer in Maryland.


"He was so young," Shields said of Duarte. "It makes no sense at all."


Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro called the attack on police and health care workers "the act of a coward."


"Let it not be lost on anyone the act of extraordinary bravery and courage by the health care workers here, by the law enforcement professionals … who ran toward danger to keep people safe," Shapiro said.


UPMC Memorial is a five-story, 104-bed hospital that opened in 2019 in York, a city of about 40,000 people known for its creation of York Peppermint Patties in 1940.


The shooting is part of a wave of gun violence in recent years that has swept through U.S. hospitals and medical centers, which have struggled to adapt to the growing threats. Such attacks have helped make health care one of the nation's most violent fields, with workers suffering more nonfatal injuries from workplace violence than workers in any other profession, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.


In 2023, a shooter killed a security guard in the lobby of New Hampshire’s state psychiatric hospital before being fatally shot by a state trooper. In 2022, a man killed two workers at a Dallas hospital while there to watch his child’s birth. In May of that year, a man opened fire in a medical center waiting room in Atlanta, killing one woman and wounding four. And just one month later, a gunman killed his surgeon and three other people at a Tulsa, Oklahoma, medical office because he blamed the doctor for his continuing pain after an operation.

## Trump revels in mass federal firings, jeers at Biden before CPAC crowd

date: 2025-02-23, from: VOA News USA

OXON HILL, MARYLAND — President Donald Trump said Saturday that "nobody has ever seen anything" like his administration's sweeping effort to fire thousands of federal employees and shrink the size of government. 


Addressing an adoring crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference in suburban Washington, Trump said, "We're going to forge a new and lasting political majority that will drive American politics for generations to come." 


The president has spent the opening weeks of his administration arguing that voters in November gave him a mandate to overhaul government while cracking down on the U.S.-Mexico border and to extend tax cuts that were the signature policy of his first administration. 


In a speech that lasted more than an hour, Trump predicted that the Republican Party would defy history, which has shown that a president's party typically struggles during midterm congressional elections. Of Republicans, he said, "I don't think we've been at this level, maybe ever." 


"Nobody's ever seen anything like this, and nobody's ever seen four weeks like we had," Trump said, likening his new administration's opening month to being on a roll through the first four holes of a round of golf, which he said gave him confidence for the fifth. 


Trump has empowered billionaire Elon Musk to help carry out the firings; Musk vowed Saturday that more might be coming. 


"Consistent with President @realDonaldTrump's instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week," Musk posted on X, which he owns. "Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation." 


Trump also repeatedly said Saturday that he'd carry out harder-line immigration policies. But those efforts have largely been overshadowed by his administration's mass federal firings. He announced that one agency that had been significantly reduced, the U.S. Agency for International Development, would have its Washington office taken over by Customs and Border Protection officials. 


"The agency's name has been removed from its former building," he said. 


The president also repeated his previous promises that his administration will scrutinize the country's gold depository at Fort Knox. 


"Would anybody like to join us?" he said to cheers from the crowd. "We want to see if the gold is still there." 


'Donald, don't get angry' 


But Trump also devoted large parts of his address to last year's presidential race, jeering at former President Joe Biden and mispronouncing the first name of former Vice President Kamala Harris — his Election Day opponent. 


He also mentioned Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat who ran for president in 2020. 


The president said immigration and border policy under Biden made him angry. 


"I couldn't stand it," Trump said, before cautioning himself, "Donald, don't get angry." He went on to use an expletive to describe what he thinks of Biden's handling of border security, despite noting that evangelical conservatives have urged him not to use foul language. 


Trump had kinder words for Chinese President Xi Jinping, saying "I happen to like" him, while adding, "we've been treated very unfairly by China and many other countries." 


President meets with world leaders


On the sidelines of the conference, Trump met with conservative Polish President Andrzej Duda amid rising tensions in Europe over Russia's war in Ukraine. After he took the stage, Trump saluted Duda and Argentine President Javier Milei, who separately addressed the conference. 


Trump called Duda "a fantastic man and a great friend of mine." He noted that Milei was "a MAGA guy, too, Make Argentina Great Again." 


Duda is a populist who has enjoyed a close relationship with Trump in years past. Poland is a longtime ally of Ukraine. Trump upended recent U.S. policy by dispatching top foreign policy advisers to Saudi Arabia for direct talks with Russian officials that were aimed at ending fighting in Ukraine. 


Those meetings did not include Ukrainian or European officials, which has alarmed U.S. allies. After his face-to-face with Duda, Trump is meeting Monday at the White House with French President Emmanuel Macron and Thursday with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. 


Trump also has begun a public back and forth with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom the U.S. president called a "dictator" while falsely suggesting that Ukraine started the war — though on Friday he acknowledged that Russia attacked its neighbor. 


Trump said during his speech, "I'm dealing with President Zelenskyy. I'm dealing with President Putin" and added of fighting in Ukraine, "It affects Europe. It doesn't really affect us." 


About ending the war in Ukraine, Trump said Saturday, "I think we're pretty close to a deal, and we better be close to a deal."  


Later, the president and first lady Melania Trump were hosting an evening reception and dinner at the White House for the National Governors Association, which was holding their own weekend meetings in Washington.
