<h2 id="jemm-5.85">Jemm 5.85</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: FreeDOS News</p>
<div class="markdown_content">
<p>
Jemm is an “Expanded Memory Manager” (EMM), based on FreeDOS Emm386.
Jemm comes in two versions: Jemm386: standard version which needs an
external eXtended Memory Manager, and JemmEx: extended version which has
an XMM already included. Japheth recently released a new version: v5.85
has several fixes and new features, including fixed: VDS func ax=810Ch:
set ZF if disable cnt reaches zero, fixed: VDS: added several argument
checks, fixed: ISA DMA ports 000A-000F must be handled by Jemm to detect
FD access, and linear address region 110000-3FFFFF is now only mapped as
far as needed by the monitor program. Thanks, Japheth! You can find the
new version at

<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: FreeDOS News</p>
<div class="markdown_content">
<p>
If you’re following along with the latest development tools, you may be
interested in JWasm, a MASM-compatible assembler. Version 2.19pre2 fixes
bugs like format mz: stack segment was never written, format mz,pe:
start offset for first segment may have resulted in an invalid binary,
and fastcall 32-bit (MS style): registers may have held float arguments.
Other changes include write listing reworked, option -pe: add segments
with combine type stack, and .model flat: ensure variables in 16-bit
segments can be accessed directly if segment register is assumed flat.

AMB stands for “Ancient Machine Book”. It is an extremely lightweight
file format meant to store any kind of hypertext documentation that may
be comfortably viewed even on the most ancient PCs: technical manuals,
books, etc. Think of it as a retro equivalent of a CHM help file.
Mateusz Viste recently released a new version of AMB. Version “20250110”
(that’s “January 10, 2025”) includes patches kindly contributed by Jens
Guenther: fixed screen garbling on PGUP, and added handling of HOME and
END keys. Download the new version from
