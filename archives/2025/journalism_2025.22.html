uncovers UCLA budget deficit, USAC resolution calls for
transparency</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-06, from: The Daily Bruin (UCLA Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>Nicholas Reese was trying to conduct research for a student meal
swipe donation initiative when he discovered multiple UCLA financial
deficits that have gone unpublicized. Reese, a third-year political
science student, said he learned through his research and an
administrator that UCLA’s dining budget was inflated and the
administration was going to rely on unused student swipes to fund that
deficit.</p>

academics.</p>

<p>Contrary to a certain rumor, this year’s Senior Prank did
<em>not</em> involve placing a Cybertruck on the roof of Beckman
Auditorium. Instead, we celebrated Nobel Laureate Prof. Kip Thorne’s
85th birthday following the transformation of Beckman into the wedding
cake it’s often called. Festivities included a music-synchronized light
show and Kip-themed treats: Kipcorn (popcorn), Kippy candy (cotton
candy), atomic fireballs, starburst, cosmic freeze berry star clusters,
star lollipops, Kipper snacks (sardines), and Milky Ways. It was truly
an out-of-this-world party that bent the fabric of spacetime!</p>

<p>It is well known that A.I. companies have red-teaming, RLHF, and
guardrail teams specialized in protecting against hate speech,
bomb-making, or any crazy idea that pops into a person’s destructive

bypass the blockade, creating monstrosities. If there are psychopathic

<p>date: 2025-06-03, from: California Tech (Caltech Student
Newspaper)</p>
<p>When I first set foot in California, leaving behind the sun-kissed
hills of Italy, my heart was heavy with anticipation and anxiety. As
someone raised in a profoundly Catholic family, faith was not just a
tradition—it was the very fabric of my upbringing. Church bells, Sunday
Mass, and a close-knit parish community were constants in my life. The
thought of crossing the Atlantic for my studies filled me with
excitement and a silent worry: Would I find a place where my faith could
thrive? Would I see a community that shared my values, or would I feel
lost in the vastness of a new culture?</p>

<p>Amid deadlines, data, and delayed dreams, it’s easy to overlook the
fact that life doesn’t wait for us to solve every problem. At Caltech,
where ambition surrounds us and the future feels constant, the present
can easily fade into the background. Yet beneath the weight of
equations, lab reports, and sleepless nights lies a truth waiting to be
unearthed: <em>hic et nunc</em>—“here and now.” This simple, ancient
Latin phrase serves as a profound reminder that our only true existence
is in the present.</p>

<p>When I first set foot on Caltech’s campus, I felt like a contestant
on a reality show called <em>Survivor: Genius Island</em>. I was fresh
off the plane from Milan, armed with a suitcase full of dreams, a double
major in biology and chemistry (because why not suffer twice as much?),
and a secret hope to someday heal cancer. I planned to take the world by
storm—or, at the very least, survive my first quarter without
accidentally setting something on fire in the lab.</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-03, from: California Tech (Caltech Student

<p>I had my mouth pressed into the sand. I was breathing hard—desperate,
shallow, uneven. I could feel the grains entering my nose, throat, and
lungs. Somewhere nearby, I heard the rapid thudding of hooves, the
panicked exhale of a frightened horse. For a moment, I couldn’t remember
where I was. I couldn’t piece it together. The memories didn’t come in
order; they arrived like broken glass, sharp and disjointed. My helmet.
My shoulder. The ground. Pain. Sharp pain. A blinding throb in my
knee.</p>
<p><br></p>

Is? — A Letter From the Editor</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-03, from: California Tech (Caltech Student

<p>I am obsessed with David Lynch. Maybe unhealthily so. Few directors
feel as fluent in the art of the somnambulistic; I know of no other
director who could so deftly craft phantasmagorical operas of the
manifold dream-nightmare that is the human experience.</p>

<p>The Mount Wilson Solar Observatory was founded in 1904 by George
Hale, who was also a trustee of Throop Polytechnic Institute (which
later became Caltech). The first telescope built on-site was the Snow
Solar Telescope in 1904, followed closely by the 60-foot Solar Tower and
the 60-inch telescope, both of which were completed in 1908. Hale hosted
many famous individuals during this time, including Andrew Carnegie in
1910 and Harlow Shapley in 1914. Carnegie was the main financial
supporter of the observatory from its inception in 1904, and Shapley was
an astronomer who discovered our position in the Milky Way galaxy using
the 60-inch telescope.</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-03, from: California Tech (Caltech Student
Newspaper)</p>
<p>I can’t be sure, but if I had to take a gamble, I would guess most of
you—like me—are always trying to optimize our paths around campus. There
are multiple reasons this could be true: (almost) late for class and
want to minimize how much you miss? Want to make it to Tom Mannion’s OH
before the rest of campus wipes out all the Flamin’ Hot Cheetos? Want to
get to bed when a coyote is chasing you down? Want to get the latest
sighting of Ted Danson on campus? Want to make that last 2:58 p.m. dash
to Browne on the weekend before all you have is Red Door? Want to beat
the 10:30 a.m. line explosion at Red Door? Or the weekend 3 p.m. line
explosion? Or the 10 p.m. line explosion, or… You get the idea.</p>

Rugby</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-03, from: California Tech (Caltech Student
Newspaper)</p>
<p>I read the article in <em>The California Tech</em> about the Caltech
Rugby Club with great interest because I organised a rugby team at
Caltech about 60 years ago (between 1965 and 1967). Most of the team
were foreign graduate students from rugby-playing countries, but a few
Americans joined us. We had mixed success but managed a few wins,
notably against UCLA. The games against USC and Eagle Rock were
particularly scary, as their teams consisted of very large American
Football players looking for blood and violence in the off-season. We
won a few games we didn’t deserve to because of the athletic ability of
Mick Mortell from Ireland—he could kick penalties from 50 meters and
more.</p>

<p>On May 3rd, Frautschi Hall, 7 p.m., as part of MACH 33: The Caltech
Festival of New Science-Driven Plays, was the latest version of Tom
Lavagnino’s <em>Dementia Doula</em>. Like the festival’s other show,
entitled <em>The Null Test</em> (which explores the legal hijinks of a
self-driving car company), this was a staged reading: the cast, directed
by Susan Dalian, performing from scripts on music stands. Originally
presented under the name <em>Crisis Goalie</em> at the 2024 Utah
Shakespeare Festival, then directed by Britannia Howe, this pared-down
staging celebrates the script on its own terms, privileging nuanced
acting over elaborate production.</p>

<p>At first glance, Dr. Loraine Lundquist might strike you as a
scientist with her head in the stars. After all, she holds a Ph.D. in
physics from UC Berkeley and once helped launch a satellite to study the
Sun’s magnetic field. But spend an hour with her, and that’s precisely
what we did during the recent SASS Lunch hosted by the Caltech Y—and
you’ll quickly realize that her gaze is firmly grounded on Earth, with a
heart set on building a more just and sustainable future right here in
Los Angeles.</p>
