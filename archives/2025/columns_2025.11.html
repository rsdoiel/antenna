2025-03-20 Something about the bot defence is working
</h1>
<p>
At midnight, there was a surge in activity. CPU usage went up.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-03-20-bot-defence-1.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Load went up, too. But it stayed within reasonable bounds – less than 4
instead of the more than 80 I have seen in the past.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-03-20-bot-defence-2.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
And the number of IP addresses blocked by <code>fail2ban</code> went
from 40 to 50.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-03-20-bot-defence-3.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
I’m usually sceptical of this because the big attacks are from a far
wider variety of IP numbers. In this case, however, maybe there was some
probing that resulted in blocks? I don’t know. Lucky, I guess?
</p>
<p>
In any case, the site is still up. Yay for small wins.
</p>
<p>
Also, I cannot overstate how good it feel to have some
<a href="https://munin-monitoring.org/">Munin</a> graphs available.
</p>
<p>
<code>alex-bots</code> is a setup I desribed in
<a href="2025-02-19-bots-again">2025-02-19 Bots again, cursed</a>.
Basically a request to one of my Oddmuse wikis containing the parameter
<code>rcidonly</code> is an expensive endpoint: “all changes for this
single page” or “a feed for this single page”. This is something a human
would rarely access and yet it somehow the URLs landed in some dataset
for AI training, I suspect. So what I do is I’m redirecting any request
containing “rcidonly” in the query string to <code>/nobots</code>,
warning humans not to click on these links.
</p>
<p>
In addition to that, the filter
<code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/alex-bots.conf</code> contains this:
</p>
<pre><code>[Definition]
failregex = ^(www\.emacswiki\.org|communitywiki\.org|campaignwiki\.org):[0-9]+ &lt;HOST&gt; .*rcidonly=
</code></pre>
<p>
And I added a section using this filter to my jail
<code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/alex.conf</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>[alex-bots]
enabled = true
port    = http,https
logpath = %(apache_access_log)s
findtime = 3600
maxretry = 2
</code></pre>
<p>
So if an IP number visits three URLs containing “rcidonly” in an hour,
they get banned for ten minutes.
</p>
<p>
The <code>recidive</code> filter (a standard filter you just need to
activate) then makes sure that any IP number that got blocked three
times gets blocked for a week.

every commit in every repo, and they do so using random User-Agents that
overlap with end-users and come from tens of thousands of IP addresses –
mostly residential, in unrelated subnets, each one making no more than
one HTTP request over any time period we tried to measure – actively and
maliciously adapting and blending in with end-user traffic and avoiding

Then, yesterday morning, KDE GitLab infrastructure was overwhelmed by
another AI crawler, with IPs from an Alibaba range; this caused GitLab
to be temporarily inaccessible by KDE developers. I then discovered
that, one week ago, an Anime girl started appearing on the GNOME GitLab
instance, as the page was loaded. It turns out that it’s the default
loading page for Anubis, a proof-of-work challenger that blocks AI
scrapers that are causing outages. –

<p>
What do SourceHut, GNOME’s GitLab, and KDE’s GitLab have in common,
other than all three of them being forges? Well, it turns out all three
of them have been dealing with immense amounts of traffic from “AI”
scrapers, who are effectively performing DDoS attacks with such ferocity
it’s bringing down the infrastructures of these major open source
projects. Being open source, and thus publicly accessible, means these
scrapers have unlimited access, unlike with proprietary projects. …
Everything about this “AI” bubble is gross, and I can’t wait for this
bubble to pop so a semblance of sanity can return to the technology
world. Until the next hype train rolls into the station, of course. –

Sean Conner of the The Boston Diaries: He reports on
<a href="https://boston.conman.org/2025/03/21">Friday, March 21,
2025</a> that his logs show a total of 468439 requests for February
2025. The top hitter was 4.231.104.62 with 43242 requests (9%). This was
from MICROSOFT-CORP-MSN-AS-BLOCK, US. But the ASN has more networks, of
course. Adding them all up give 78889 (17%).

He links to the <a href="https://www.team-cymru.com/ip-asn-mapping">IP

<h2 id="paving-cowpaths">Paving cowpaths</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-22, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/images/2020/04/10/cow.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">A
funny thing. A few months back someone told me that I had been gone from
the podcast world for too long for anyone to listen to me. I thought how
weird, I didn’t go anywhere at all, I stayed exactly
<a href="http://scripting.com/">where</a> I was, all the time. Virtually
every day. If people cared to know what I think they could have found
out pretty quickly because I am of course an
<a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/11/24/naturalbornBlogger.html">NBB</a>.
I talk about what I think all the time. (And besides, why do you care
where you get ideas from, I don’t.)
</p>
<p>
Anyway, the idea was about a
<a href="https://this.how/podcasting/index.opml#1733322866000">feature
for podcasting</a> that would open up doors for influencers and ad hoc
networks of podcasts, instead of a few dozen weak (imho) attempts to
build synergy, I trust that invisible hand Darwinian ecosystem builds
better networks, because they are real, not contrived.
</p>
<p>
Give the people the tools and see what happens.
</p>
<p>
Users and developers party together.
</p>
<p>
That’s the opposite of the “move fast and break things” approach to
technology, instead it’s “paving the cowpaths,” the process that has
always fascinated me and been the method to my madness. Make the tools,
give them to the people and sit back and hope something happens. When it
doesn’t try to show the way. And try out lots of these kinds of ideas.
</p>
<p>
This method really works, and it isn’t destructive, it’s totally
constructive. (Actually it does destroy what was there before, but in a
merciful way, they get a chance to jump on the train, even if they
rarely do, but NPR got on early with podcasting, and the NYT with RSS.)
</p>
<p>
PS: I did not invent “paving cowpaths” – it’s been around for a long
time, like
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1905885-the-mythical-man-month-essays-on-software-engineering">mythical
man-month</a> and the like. It’s pretty much the same thing as
<a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/11/30/bootstrapping.html">bootstrapping</a>,
which I also advocate.

If you’ve followed my <a href="Butlerian_Jihad">Butlerian Jihad</a>

got written in the middle of an attack as I’m trying to save my sites,
documenting as I go along. But if you’re looking for an overview, there
is nothing to see. It’s all over the place. Since the topic has gained
some traction in recent days, I’m going to assemble all the things I do
on this page.

<p>
I had read some similar reports before, on fedi, but this one links to
quite a few of them:
<a href="https://thelibre.news/foss-infrastructure-is-under-attack-by-ai-companies/">FOSS
infrastructure is under attack by AI companies</a>, by Niccolò
Venerandi, for LibreNews.
</p>
<p>
I’m going to skip the defences against spam as spam hasn’t been a
problem in recent months, surprisingly.
</p>
<p>
The first defence against bots is <code>robots.txt</code>. All
well-behaving bots should read it every now and then and then either
stop crawling the site or slow down.
</p>
<p>
Let’s look at the file
<a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/robots.txt">for Emacs Wiki</a>.
</p>
<p>
If I find that there are lot of requests from a particular user agent
that looks like bot, and it has a URL where I can find instructions for
how to address it in <code>robots.txt</code>, this is what I do. I tell
them to stop crawling the entire site. Most of these are search engine
optimizers, brand awareness monitors and other such creeps.
</p>
<p>
The file also tells all well-behaving crawlers to slow down to a glacial
tempo and it lists all the expensive endpoints that they should not be
crawling at all. Conversely, this means that any bot that still crawls
those URLs is a misbehaving bot and deserves to be blocked.
</p>
<p>
Worth noting, perhaps, that “an expensive endpoint” means a URL that
runs some executable to do something complicated, resulting in an answer
that’s always different. If the URL causes the web server to run a CGI
script, for example, the request loads Perl, loads a script, loads all
its libraries, compiles it all, runs it once, and answers with the
request with the output. And since the answer is dynamic, it can’t very
well be cached, or additional complexity needs to be introduced and even
more resources need to be allocated and paid for. In short, an expensive
end-point is like loading an app. It’s slow but useful, if done rarely.
So you’d do this for a human, for example. It’s a disaster if bots swarm
all over the site, clicking on every link.
</p>
<p>
It’s also worth noting that not all my sites have the same expensive
endpoints and so the second half of <code>robots.txt</code> can vary.
Which makes maintenance of the first half a chore. I have a little
script that allows me to add one bot to “all” the files, but it’s
annoying to have to do that. And I recently just copied a list from an
<a href="https://robotstxt.com/ai">AI / LLM User-Agents: Blocking
Guide</a>.
</p>
<p>
I use Apache as my web-server and I have a bunch of global configuration
files to handle misbehaving bots and crawlers.
</p>
<p>
This example blocks fediverse agents from accessing my site. That’s
because whenever anybody post a URL to one of my sites, within the next
60 seconds, all the servers with users getting a copy of the URL will
fetch a preview. That means hundreds of hits. This is particularly
obnoxious for expensive endpoints. This response here tells them that
they are forbidden from accessing the page.
</p>
<pre><code># Fediverse instances asking for previews: protect the expensive endpoints
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} /(wiki|download|food|paper|hug|helmut|input|korero|check|radicale|say|mojo|software)
RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} Mastodon|Friendica|Pleroma [nocase]
# then it's forbidden
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ - [forbidden,last]
</code></pre>
<p>
These are the evil bots that self-identify as a bot but don’t seem to
heed the <code>robots.txt</code> files. These are all told that whatever
page they were looking for, it’s now gone (410). And if there’s a human
looking at the output, it even links to an explanation. Adding new user
agents to this list is annoying because I need to connect as root and
restart the web server after making any changes.
</p>
<pre><code># SEO bots, borked feed services and other shit
RewriteCond &quot;%{HTTP_USER_AGENT}&quot; &quot;academicbotrtu|ahrefsbot|amazonbot|awariobot|bitsightbot|blexbot|bytespider|dataforseobot|discordbot|domainstatsbot|dotbot|elisabot|eyemonit|facebot|linkfluence|magpie-crawler|megaindex|mediatoolkitbot|mj12bot|newslitbot|paperlibot|pcore|petalbot|pinterestbot|seekportbot|semanticscholarbot|semrushbot|semanticbot|seokicks-robot|siteauditbot|startmebot|summalybot|synapse|trendictionbot|twitterbot|wiederfrei|yandexbot|zoominfobot|velenpublicwebcrawler|gpt|\bads|feedburner|brandwatch|openai|facebookexternalhit|yisou|docspider&quot; [nocase]
RewriteRule ^ https://alexschroeder.ch/nobots [redirect=410,last]
</code></pre>
<p>
For some of my sites, I disallow all user agents containing the words
“bot”, “crawler”, “spider”, “ggpht” or “gpt” with the exception of
“archivebot” and “wibybot” because these two bots I want to give access.
Again, these bots are all told that whatever page they were looking for,
it’s now gone (410).
</p>
<pre><code># Private sites block all bots and crawlers. This list does no include
# social.alexschroeder.ch, communitywiki.org, www.emacswiki.org,
# oddmuse.org, orientalisch.info, korero.org.

RewriteCond &quot;%{HTTP_USER_AGENT}&quot; &quot;bot|crawler|spider|ggpht|gpt&quot; [nocase]
RewriteRule ^ https://alexschroeder.ch/nobots [redirect=410,last]
</code></pre>
<p>
I also eliminate a lot of bots looking for PHP endpoints. I can do this
because I know that I don’t have any PHP application installed.
</p>
<pre><code># Deny all idiots that are looking for borked PHP applications
RewriteRule \.php$ https://alexschroeder.ch/nobots [redirect=410,last]
</code></pre>
<p>
There’s also one particular image scraper that’s using a unique string
in its user agent.
</p>
<pre><code># Deny the image scraper
# https://imho.alex-kunz.com/2024/02/25/block-this-shit/
RewriteCond &quot;%{HTTP_USER_AGENT}&quot; &quot;Firefox/72.0&quot; [nocase]
RewriteRule ^ https://alexschroeder.ch/nobots [redirect=410,last]
</code></pre>
<p>
Next, all requests get logged by Apache in the <code>access.log</code>
file. I use <code>fail2ban</code> to check this logfile. This is
somewhat interesting because <code>fail2ban</code> is usually used to
check for failed ssh login attempts. Those IP numbers that fail to login
in a few times are banned. What I’m doing is I wrote a filter that
treats every hit on the web server as a “failed login attempt”.
</p>
<p>
This is the filter:
</p>
<pre><code>[Definition]
# Most sites in the logfile count! What doesn't count is fedi.alexschroeder.ch, or chat.campaignwiki.org.
failregex = ^(www\.)?(alexschroeder\.ch|campaignwiki\.org|communitywiki\.org|emacswiki\.org|flying-carpet\.ch|korero\.org|oddmuse\.org|orientalisch\.info):[0-9]+ &lt;HOST&gt; 

# Except css files, images...
ignoreregex = ^[^&quot;]*&quot;(GET /(robots\.txt |favicon\.ico |[^/ \&quot;]+\.(css|js) |[^\&quot;]*\.(jpg|JPG|png|PNG) |css/|fonts/|pdfs/|txt/|pics/|export/|podcast/|1pdc/|static/|munin/|osr/|indie/|rpg/|face/|traveller/|hex-describe/|text-mapper/|contrib/pics/|roll/|alrik/|wiki/download/)|(OPTIONS|PROPFIND|REPORT) /radicale)
</code></pre>
<p>
And this is the jail, saying that any IP number may make 30 hits in 60
seconds. If an IP number exceeds this (2s per page!) then it gets
blocked at the firewall for 10 minutes.
</p>
<pre><code>[alex-apache]
enabled = true
port    = http,https
logpath = %(apache_access_log)s
findtime = 60
maxretry = 30
</code></pre>
<p>
I also have another filter for a particular substring in URLs that I
found the bots are requesting all the time:
</p>
<pre><code>[Definition]
failregex = ^(www\.emacswiki\.org|communitywiki\.org|campaignwiki\.org):[0-9]+ &lt;HOST&gt; .*rcidonly=
</code></pre>
<p>
The corresponding jail says that when you trigger request such a URL for
the third time in an hour, you’re blocked at the firewall for 10
minutes.
</p>
<p>
[alex-bots] enabled = true port = http,https logpath =
%(apache_access_log)s findtime = 3600 maxretry = 2
</p>
<p>
(At the same time, these URL’s redirect to
<a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/nobots">a warning</a> so that humans
know that this is a trap.)
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, <code>fail2ban</code> also comes with a
<code>recidive</code> filter that watches its own logs. If an IP has
been banned five times in a day, it gets banned for a week.
</p>
<pre><code>[recidive]
enabled = true
</code></pre>
<p>
To add to the <code>alex-bots</code> jail, here’s what my Apache
configuration says: RSS feeds for single pages are errors.
</p>
<pre><code>RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} action=rss
RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} rcidonly=.*
RewriteRule .* /error.rss [last]
</code></pre>
<p>
Note that all my sites also use the following headers, so anybody
ignoring these is also a prime candidate for blocking.
</p>
<pre><code># https://github.com/rom1504/img2dataset#opt-out-directives
Header always set X-Robots-Tag: noai
Header always set X-Robots-Tag: noimageai
</code></pre>
<p>
All of the above still doesn’t handle extremely distributed attacks. In
such situations, almost all IP numbers are unique. What I try to do in
this situation is block the entire IP range that they come from. I scan
the <code>access.log</code> for IP numbers that connected to a URL that
shouldn’t be used by bots because of <code>robots.txt</code>, containing
<code>rcidonly</code> because I know humans will very rarely click it
and it’s expensive to serve. For each such IP number, I determine the IP
range they come from, and then I block it all.
</p>
<p>
Basically, this is what I keep repeating:
</p>
<pre><code># prefix with a timestamp
date
# log some candidates without whois information, skipping my fedi instance
tail -n 2000 /var/log/apache2/access.log \
 | grep -v ^social \
 | grep &quot;rcidonly&quot; \
 | bin/admin/network-lookup-lean &gt; result.log
# count
grep ipset result.log|wc -l
# add
grep ipset result.log|sh
# document
grep ipset result.log&gt;&gt;bin/admin/ban-cidr
</code></pre>
<p>
You can find the scripts in my
<a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/admin/">admin collection</a>.
</p>

</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-03-22</strong>. The drawback of using the firewall to ban
broad swaths of the Internet is that these networks host bots (bad) but
also networked services that I’m interested in (good). Yesterday I found
that
<a class="account" href="https://come-from.mad-scientist.club/users/algernon" title="@algernon@come-from.mad-scientist.club"><span
class="citation" data-cites="algernon">@algernon</span></a> had gone
silent, had been silent for quite a while, and yet I kept seeing replies
to them by others. Something was off. We got into contact via an alt
account and indeed, I had blocked the IPv4 range his server was on.
</p>
<p>
So by my count I already had to unblock three networks on my list. It’s
not a great solution, to be honest. And it doesn’t expire, either. The
list still contains 47021 IP ranges.

<p>
It’s impossible to know exactly which parts of LibGen Meta used to train
its AI, and which parts it might have decided to exclude; this snapshot
was taken in January 2025, after Meta is known to have accessed the

Werdmuller</a> and
<a href="https://om.co/2025/03/16/my-new-daily-blog/">Om Malik</a> for
their nice writeups of WordLand on their blogs. They’re right. It is a
small piece that can be hooked into lots of places, as is WordPress a
big place that can host lots of apps many of which haven’t been written
yet. Products that look outward that can be hooked up in a million ways
to everything, and leave the door open for those who follow. Such
products are rare in our world. People always try to own their users by
locking out competitors. I found a perfect spot for me to put some
software, and I am having fun watching people use it, and coming up with
new features that build on what we have. I think the writing tools
market for WordPress will be huge, and I firmly believe that will turn
into what I call
<a href="http://scripting.com/2025/03/13/132830.html">the writer’s
web</a>, which you could also think of as just the web. Ben thinks of it
as the “indie web,” and that’s fine. It’s all just the web. Anyway, I
should have put something here a long time ago, but I didn’t look inside
WordPress until a couple of years ago and I really liked what I
found.</p>

<p>Mini-spoilers follow. I’m a Severance lover, it’s definitely one of
the best shows ever, and I feel even more so after the season 2 finale
which I watched last night on AppleTV+. I think there are two types of
Severance users. One whose focus is on the evil and the other whose
focus is on the love. If you think nothing happened in the finale then
you’re the first type, if you are the second type, this episode was
incredible rich. And we learned what the goats were about and that’s not
nothing.</p>

<a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67dd5fa5d278819192d9fca03485723f-wordland-support">something</a>
that could be useful. A ChatGPT with instructions on how to help a user
with <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>. Try clicking the
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67dd5fa5d278819192d9fca03485723f-wordland-support">link</a>
and see what happens, esp if you’re a regular WordLand user. I
discovered the feature first by asking if the bot knew what WordLand
was, and it said it did, and got it mostly right. I’ve been using
ChatGPT to develop the product, so it’s possible it has retained some of
the info. And the <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">docs</a> are on
the web. This is one of those times when you really want the AI bot to
ingest everything it can find. Worried about hallucinations. But with a
product like WordLand, which could show up problems in the browser or a
WordPress theme, a lot of the help requests are not problems with
WordLand itself. Here’s a
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/62">thread</a>
where you can report on your experience. Remember the

<ul>
<li>
Terminology: I don’t thnk we should use the term <i>social web</i> until
there actually is such a thing, so I invented a new term for these
twitter-like services.
</li>
<li>
Since Ghost is now supporting ActivityPub, I felt we needed to include
Substack because the two products compete directly.
</li>
<li>
I consider AT Proto a proprietary protocol for now, as proprietary as
Mastodon’s API.
</li>
<li>
I included WordPress because it supports ActivityPub.

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A sophisticated cascading supply chain attack has compromised multiple
GitHub Actions, exposing critical CI/CD secrets across tens of thousands
of repositories. The attack, which originally targeted the widely used
“tj-actions/changed-files” utility, is now believed to have originated
from an earlier breach of the “reviewdog/action-setup@v1” GitHub Action,
according to a report.
</p>
<p>
[…]
</p>
<p>
CISA confirmed the vulnerability has been patched in version 46.0.1.
</p>
<p>
Given that the utility is used by more than 23,000 GitHub repositories,
the scale of potential impact has raised significant alarm throughout
the developer community…

<p>
If you aren’t sure how to ask for help with software, try first asking
ChatGPT or another AI chatbot to help figure out what’s going wrong. It
has infinite time to help, and won’t mind if the problem turned out to
be a random browser plug-in that was misbehaving.
</p>
<p>
It often suggests trying things you might not have thought of.
</p>
<p>
I use it myself esp as often is the case there’s no one who can or is
willing to work for me for free. I’m already playing it $20 per month,
and for that I get as much time as it takes.
</p>
<p>
Really good for organizing your approach to a problem.

cost of transacting on a blockchain like Bitcoin’s to suffer massive
spikes at intervals. When no-one wants to transact, fees are low. When
everyone does, they are high. Below the fold I look in detail at a
typical Bitcoin fee spike.<br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span>

Bitcoin’s block time is targeted at ten seconds,

<blockquote>
Bitcoin blocks now have a theoretical maximum size of 4 megabytes and a
more realistic maximum size of 2 megabytes
</blockquote>
Thus the rate at which transactions are included in blocks is limited to
an average of around 7 per second. The chart shows the number of
transactions included in a block each day for the same period. Note that
the day of the fee spike Bitcoin processed 42% of the average of the
three days before and three days after. The variance of the transaction
rate is high. For example, on 7<sup>th</sup> September the blockchain
processed 76% more transactions than the average of the three following
days.<br /> <br />

Because the rate at which transactions arrive in the mempool is variable
but the rate at which they leave is capped, even transactions with miner
fees suffer a variable delay before being included in a block. Miners
choose the most profitable transactions to include. This chart shows the
median transaction wait time in minutes over the same period. Note that
on average they wait about one block time, but that on 6<sup>th</sup>
June they waited much less time.<br /> <br />

The distribution of wait times is highly skewed, with a long tail of
low-value transactions. This chart shows the average wait time for
transactions with fees, expressed as a multiple of the median wait time.
Note the ramp up in average wait time ratio, peaking the day after the
fee spike.<br /> <br /> The ratio between median and average wait times
implies that the spike in the average value of transactions on
6<sup>th</sup> June, coming on top of the ramp in transactions waiting
in the mempool from 1<sup>st</sup> June, caused a build-up of low-value
transactions, which suffered massive delays as the miners chose the
transactions with higher value and fees.<br /> <br /> In 2017’s

It definitely tempts people into ether. This is the biggest problem with
bitcoin, it’s not just that it’s expensive to transact, it’s
<i>uncertain</i> to transact. It’s hard to know if you’ve put enough of

guaranteed. There are a lot of people who don’t know how to set their
fees, and it takes hours to confirm transactions. It’s a bad system and
no one has any solutions.

Transactions which fail to get the attention of miners sit in limbo
until they drop out. But the suspended state leaves payers entirely
helpless. They can’t risk resending the transaction, in case the
original one does clear eventually. They can’t recall the original one
either. Our source says he’s had a significant sized transaction waiting
to be settled for two weeks.

<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lkqf4hrkc22e">on

web</a>, was overtaken by Twitter and why, which boils down to this –
the reading platforms wouldn’t work with each other. So Twitter made
subscription one click. And RSS made sites include 25 buttons to give
people one-click subscription in every popular feed reader. Twitter only
needed one button. And it worked every time. Now, 18 years later, the
twitter-like systems world, Mastodon, Threads, Substack, Ghost, Bluesky,
etc mostly can’t get together on a simple way to peer. They keep talking
about it and while they do, we’re losing everything that’s important to
us. In the open tech world we have the same problem as the Democratic
Party and the same problem RSS had. We refuse to see how the world has
changed, and our slow and steady approach leads nowhere fast. We can’t
all be masters of our own silo’d domain. We need a web for words that’s
simple and can be learned in an afternoon, but doesn’t lose the
essential features writers need. I don’t know what we need to win, but I
do know what we need to get started.</p>

Nichols’ piece</a>, but I don’t agree that
<a href="http://scripting.com/2025/03/13/132830.html">the writer’s
web</a> is blogging. I think it’s bigger. Blogging is <i>part</i> of the
writer’s web. Today’s writing network is much more powerful, the
software tools are stronger, and new UI standards have evolved. Things
like Digital Ocean, Markdown, Font-Awesome and Node.js didn’t exist last
time we took a serious look at writing on the web. The web with all its
features is still here. WordPress has created a strong foundation to
build on, at least as good as the social media platforms, but better
because it’s of the web, with <i>no limits. </i>We’ve got the beginning
of a new platform, one where developers compete to create great writing
and reading environments, and we don’t need federation because the web
takes care of that.</p>

<p>The basic thing about tech is that attracts people who take things
that don’t belong to them. There’s no policing. The richest people are
the ones who are best at grabbing control of other people’s creations.
That’s the common theme. Now they’re in DC, going for all of it. The
whole thing. But they’re like the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWeh4A600E0">dog that catches

they’re taking. How could they? It’s incomprehensibly vast.</p>

2025-03-19 Grounding myself
</h1>
<p>
The powerlessness when reading the news makes me think that perhaps I
need to read even less news, shut it all out.
</p>
<p>
I also find a new appreciation for all of my ancestors who bore children
and raised them even though their world seems like a hellscape compared
to what I’m seeing.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes I wish I could just go to church and sing and pray and it
would all be good again. Except it don’t believe in it.
</p>
<p>
So all I have is plants and animals to care for. In a somewhat unhealthy
(?) relationship with life around me I find that I put plants where they
need me to water them, and find solace in the fact that they at least
are unperturbed by everything and are just happy for me to be there and
tend them. It feels a bit like an artificial dependent relationship so I
dunno, it’s weird.
</p>
<p>
When I see happy dogs and their owners I keep thinking that a dog that’s
so happy to see me, to fetch that ball, to for that walk, this happiness
is real, and they are grounded in life and the present moment.
</p>
<p>
I want back this ignorant bliss of childhood, some days.
</p>
<p>
I have no illusions. While I grew up, Iran and Iraq were at war; the
Moçambique and Angolan wars of independence turned into civil wars;
Yugoslavia fell apart in civil war. Those are the conflicts I remember,
in any case. Life and the news wasn’t great. I just didn’t know.

an idea of the structures we’re working with. It’s basically a WordPress
post with added metadata. They have these kinds of structures in RSS,

there are too many formats to support. At any moment in time it feels
like each one is enormous and permanent. But show me where the new OS/2,
Novell, UCSD Pascal or CP/M apps are. Go back far enough, Alogol,
Smalltalk, Lisp, Simula. I am very much a less-is-more type protocol
designer, don’t try to plan for things you don’t have a working model
of, because the ideas you gain when you actually put the app together
will work much better. And only add things you’re willing to live with
forever. Slow down to hurry up. Etc. Anyway,

<h2 id="enshittification-as-a-matter-of-taste">Enshittification as a
matter of taste</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-19, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
“Enshittification” is a termed coined by Cory Doctorow in 2023 to
describe a pattern of decreasing quality observed in online services and
products. Since Doctorow’s post, there’s been no shortage of think
pieces on enshittification and its role in our society and to a large
extent I agree with them all. I think it’s an inevitable problem that
shows the splitting seams of Capitalism. If you will allow, I’d like to
add a tangential thought – one slight embellishment – to this topic.
</p>
<p>
To me, enshittification means that a person who lacks taste was put in a
position of power.
</p>
<p>
Everyone knows ads on the internet suck. But ads also pay bills and help
keep the lights on in newsrooms. When a website adds one
(privacy-preserving) ad to a website, I say “Okay”. Two, I permit it.
Three, I say “Easy now” but still scroll through unencumbered. But when
the website adds a fifth, seventh, twelfth ad… I know a person who lacks
taste is at the wheel. I can feel it in my bones when an app or website
has prioritized revenue over user experience. A person without taste or
high emotional intelligence broke the unspoken contract we had built on
mutual respect.
</p>
<p>
When you read about the development of the iPhone in books like Ken
Kocienda’s <em>Creative Selection</em> or Tony Fadell’s <em>Build</em>,
you understand Steve Jobs’ superpower wasn’t so much that he possessed a
reality distortion field, but that he was a great editor. He could find
the good ideas in a pile of prototypes and say “no” (harshly, I’ve read)
to the less-than-great ideas. You need a person with taste in the
decision making process.
<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino">When
we see giants falter</a>, it’s a lack of taste shining through.
</p>
<p>
Going forward, I think taste and style are more valuable than ever
before. In an era where we’re able to rapidly generate cheap low quality
content or software at a scale we’ve never seen before,
<a href="https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/elizabeth-goodspeed-column-taste-technology-art-280224">we
will need people with taste in the mix</a>. We’ll need aggregators to
dive in the dumpsters for the treasure. We’ll need people who know how
to zig when everyone is using the Zag-o-tron 9000. We’ll need people who
can offer critique and say “no” when the
“<a href="https://derekkedziora.com/notes/2024-12-11-an-llms-not-going-to-tell-you-no">yes
yes always more</a>” machine barrels through town and begins knocking
down institutions.

<h2 id="new-window-manager-niri">2025-03-15 New window manager:
niri</h2>

<h1 id="2025-03-15-new-window-manager-niri">
2025-03-15 New window manager: niri
</h1>
<p>
I’m giving <a href="https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri">niri</a> a go. The
idea is that a scrollable tiling window manager (“Wayland compositor”)
is a better fit than just a tiling window manager. For tiling window
managers, I just create new stuff and have it maximized. I really can’t
do the quick splitting and rearranging that it seems to afford. The
result is that I start moving stuff to other workspaces, where they’re
invisible and gone. I’m hoping that new windows popping up next to
existing windows makes it feel like a stack.
</p>
<p>
Having gone through the config file and having made a few small changes
it already feels pretty nice. Right now one of the problems I have is
that by sheer bad luck I decided to rotate my external monitor by 90°
and that doesn’t work quite as well, maybe? I’m not sure. One of the
first changes I did was change the default widths from ⅓ / ½ / ⅔ to 0.95
/ ⅔ / ½ with 0.95 being the default.

<p>
I didn’t find a solution for Gimp. And I already had no solution for
VASSAL under Sway. So for these applications, I still have Gnome
installed.
</p>
<p>
Currently my <code>~/.config/fish/conf.d/window-manager.fish</code>
says:
</p>
<pre><code># If running from tty1 start sway
set TTY (tty)
[ &quot;$TTY&quot; = &quot;/dev/tty1&quot; ] &amp;&amp; exec sway
[ &quot;$TTY&quot; = &quot;/dev/tty2&quot; ] &amp;&amp; exec startx
[ &quot;$TTY&quot; = &quot;/dev/tty3&quot; ] &amp;&amp; exec niri
</code></pre>
<p>
Oh well. 😅
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-03-19</strong>. I’m finding that there were too many
problems with apps that didn’t work or had very slow startup times. So
I’m back to <a href="2023-10-22-sway">using Sway</a>.

<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
This is like that moment, five years ago, when we realized that Covid
was going to kill a lot of us but it hadn’t happened yet. A lot of
people weren’t yet aware. My
<a href="http://scripting.com/images/2024/10/02/palfrey2003.jpeg">friend</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Palfrey">John Palfrey</a>,
who is a legal scholar, has been writing about this moment on LinkedIn
and Facebook. Things are flashing by very quickly, so I’m going to
publish his latest piece here, below, so it gets a chance to get to the
places I’m hooked into.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Lawyer friends and non-lawyer friends: has it become hard to say out
loud in public: “we believe in the rule of law in America”? That seems
not remotely controversial as a concept. The relative quiet on this
topic is what is striking me most at the moment.
</li>
<li>
It would be a good idea for our Republic to avoid sleepwalking through a
Constitutional crisis. Of course there are extremely talented lawyers
working overtime on many fronts. Those who are not directly involved in
litigation have other tools, including voice and funding and organizing,
to make plain the simple truth that we should not let the rule of law
slip away in America bit by bit. That will continue to happen if the
rulings of federal judges can simply be ignored or sidestepped with
impunity.
</li>
<li>
If the legislature has abdicated its role in checking the power of the
executive, and then the judicial branch is also out, well, that leaves
just one. This is not “fancy law stuff”. This is “4th grade civics
stuff” – separation of powers, checks and balances (I know, I know, we
don’t teach civics enough in America…).
</li>
<li>
It is actually <em>not</em> more complicated than that. It can’t be that
hard to say out loud: “we value the rule of law in America” – no matter
your politics or party.
</li>
</ul>

<p>date: 2025-03-18, updated: 2025-03-17, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Really interesting research:
“<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24/presentation/hasegawa">How
WEIRD is Usable Privacy and Security Research?</a>” by Ayako A. Hasegawa
Daisuke Inoue, and Mitsuaki Akiyama:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Abstract</b>: In human factor fields such as human-computer
interaction (HCI) and psychology, researchers have been concerned that
participants mostly come from WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized,
Rich, and Democratic) countries. This WEIRD skew may hinder
understanding of diverse populations and their cultural differences. The
usable privacy and security (UPS) field has inherited many research
methodologies from research on human factor fields. We conducted a
literature review to understand the extent to which participant samples
in UPS papers were from WEIRD countries and the characteristics of the
methodologies and research topics in each user study recruiting Western
or non-Western participants. We found that the skew toward WEIRD
countries in UPS is greater than that in HCI. Geographic and linguistic
barriers in the study methods and recruitment methods may cause
researchers to conduct user studies locally. In addition, many papers
did not report participant demographics, which could hinder the
replication of the reported studies, leading to low reproducibility. To
improve geographic diversity, we provide the suggestions including
facilitate replication studies, address geographic and linguistic issues
of study/recruitment methods, and facilitate research on the topics for
non-WEIRD populations…

Philosophers</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Jessica Smith’s blog</p>
<p>
About a month ago,
<a href="https://www.jayeless.net/2025/02/indies-first-library-trip.html" title="Blog post from 15 Feb: Indie&#39;s First Library Trip">I
mentioned</a> that we’d borrowed a book from this “Big Ideas for Little
Philosophers” series called <cite>Love with Plato</cite>. Even though I
made fun of it at the time, it actually struck me as a really nice
little book, and since I was curious about what they would say about the
other philosophers, I shelled out to order the whole series:

<p>
I’m pleased to be able to offer a <em>positive</em> baby book review.
While I don’t think the books in this series have all accurately
outlined the core theses of their respective philosophers, they
<em>are</em> all really good, thoughtful books that invite kids to
grapple with questions about how we can be good and happy people.
</p>
<p>
I mentioned last time that I wished the library had had <cite>Equality
with Simone de Beauvoir</cite>, and that <em>is</em> one of my
favourites, now that I’ve read it. It explains, in very “small
child”-friendly language, that gender stereotypes are completely
artificial, that girls and boys are really much the same (we all cry
when we’re sad, and smile when we’re happy…), and that everyone is
happier when we can be our true selves without judgement. On one page
there is also a cute cat rockin’ out with a walkman and a hula hoop in
the corner, so the book gets bonus points for that.
</p>
<p>
But then the one that really surprised me was <cite>Happiness with
Aristotle</cite>, which actually got into a deep rumination on
friendship and what it means to be a “true friend” that I think many
adults would benefit from reading. It talks about how some friends make
you laugh and feel good to spend time with, and other friends will help
you out when you need a hand, but a <em>true</em> friend is actually
someone who’ll call you out on your shit, so you can grow as a person.
(Again, in kid-friendly language.) Not only that, but the book added
that before you can be a “true friend” to others, you need to be a “true
friend” to yourself, which means “loving yourself as much as you love
your friends”. Like… damn! Where was this book when I was 18–19 and
stuck in “I can fix him!” thinking? It’s so good! Again, I’m not sure
it’s an accurate description of the very core of Aristotelian
philosophy, but it’s a great message.
</p>
<p>
The books are board books (you know, the hard cardboard ones usually
intended for real babies), but they’re full of open-ended questions to
elicit discussion with a small child. I would love to read these with
Indie when she’s, like, five and actually able to engage with the ideas
therein. I’m glad to have bought our own copies, because I think we’ll
get a lot of mileage out of them.
</p>
<p>
Having said this, the series <strong>is</strong> clearly missing a book
about one very important philosopher, one they could call something like
<cite>Communism with Marx</cite>. I guess we just can’t have it all 😔

I just discovered that there was a difference between GREEK SMALL LETTER
MU (μ) and MICRO SIGN (μ), resulting in these two hashtags on my blog to
return different results:
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Oddµ">#Oddµ</a>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Oddμ">#Oddμ</a> 😭 Ironically, I was
tricked by the compose key M U sequence into thinking that the result
was a mu but in fact it’s the micro sign. I had to go through the whole
blog, fixing this.

Salvador</a>. Who they are and what they’re accused of is unknown, as if
there’s any substance to the accusation. No indictment, trial, verdict,
appeals, etc. El Salvador wants to be the US dumping ground for
undesirables. This is where we have, as
<a href="https://snyder.substack.com/p/the-evil-at-your-door">Timothy

Security would have been the moment the light went on for most
Americans, but this should be it. Citizens like you and me being

It’s a pretty quick way to get most of the people to behave according to
the rules of the government, or off you go.</p>

Attacks</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-17, updated: 2025-03-17, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
New paper:
“<a href="https://tosc.iacr.org/index.php/ToSC/article/view/12078/11919">GPU
Assisted Brute Force Cryptanalysis of GPRS, GSM, RFID, and TETRA: Brute
Force Cryptanalysis of KASUMI, SPECK, and TEA3</a>.”
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b> Key lengths in symmetric cryptography are determined
with respect to the brute force attacks with current technology. While
nowadays at least 128-bit keys are recommended, there are many standards
and real-world applications that use shorter keys. In order to estimate
the actual threat imposed by using those short keys, precise estimates
for attacks are crucial.
</p>
<p>
In this work we provide optimized implementations of several widely used
algorithms on GPUs, leading to interesting insights on the cost of brute
force attacks on several real-word applications…

cute little app</a> that jsonifies an RSS feed. Not sure why I did it.
Postscript, it only works for one feed, mine. I replaced it with a
template in the feeder app which was a useful version of the cute little
app. Here’s a

<h2 id="blogging-is-due-for-a-refresh">Blogging is due for a
refresh</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-16, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
A lot has changed since the last time we took a serious look at
blogging. A few items, as examples.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
When RSS came along Markdown didn’t exist. The two technologies belong
together, imho.
</li>
<li>
Websockets have replaced long polling.
</li>
<li>
Servers got cheap! (and easy to deploy).
</li>
<li>
SQL is fast and the tools are much better.
</li>
<li>
The user interfaces of all the Web 2.0+ products didn’t exist last time
we created new blogging communities. We can borrow ideas from
twitter-like systems, even huge products like Facebook and Spotify have
innovations that come long after the initial wave of blogging.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
But one thing stays the same – all the components are replaceable.
Absolutely zero lock-in. We use simple standard APIs where they exist,
and create new minimal formats and protocols where they don’t.
</p>
<p>
Blogging has a simple philosophy that remains constant.
