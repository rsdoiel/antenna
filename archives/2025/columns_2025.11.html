It’s impossible to know exactly which parts of LibGen Meta used to train

Werdmuller</a> and
<a href="https://om.co/2025/03/16/my-new-daily-blog/">Om Malik</a> for
their nice writeups of WordLand on their blogs. They’re right. It is a
small piece that can be hooked into lots of places, as is WordPress a
big place that can host lots of apps many of which haven’t been written
yet. Products that look outward that can be hooked up in a million ways
to everything, and leave the door open for those who follow. Such
products are rare in our world. People always try to own their users by
locking out competitors. I found a perfect spot for me to put some
software, and I am having fun watching people use it, and coming up with
new features that build on what we have. I think the writing tools
market for WordPress will be huge, and I firmly believe that will turn
into what I call
<a href="http://scripting.com/2025/03/13/132830.html">the writer’s
web</a>, which you could also think of as just the web. Ben thinks of it
as the “indie web,” and that’s fine. It’s all just the web. Anyway, I
should have put something here a long time ago, but I didn’t look inside
WordPress until a couple of years ago and I really liked what I
found.</p>

<p>Mini-spoilers follow. I’m a Severance lover, it’s definitely one of
the best shows ever, and I feel even more so after the season 2 finale
which I watched last night on AppleTV+. I think there are two types of
Severance users. One whose focus is on the evil and the other whose
focus is on the love. If you think nothing happened in the finale then
you’re the first type, if you are the second type, this episode was
incredible rich. And we learned what the goats were about and that’s not
nothing.</p>

<p>date: 2025-03-21, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-03-20-something-about-the-bot-defence-is-working">
2025-03-20 Something about the bot defence is working
</h1>
<p>
At midnight, there was a surge in activity. CPU usage went up.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-03-20-bot-defence-1.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Load went up, too. But it stayed within reasonable bounds – less than 4
instead of the more than 80 I have seen in the past.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-03-20-bot-defence-2.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
And the number of IP addresses blocked by <code>fail2ban</code> went
from 40 to 50.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-03-20-bot-defence-3.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
I’m usually sceptical of this because the big attacks are from a far
wider variety of IP numbers. In this case, however, maybe there was some
probing that resulted in blocks? I don’t know. Lucky, I guess?
</p>
<p>
In any case, the site is still up. Yay for small wins.
</p>
<p>
Also, I cannot overstate how good it feel to have some
<a href="https://munin-monitoring.org/">Munin</a> graphs available.
</p>
<p>
<code>alex-bots</code> is a setup I desribed in
<a href="2025-02-19-bots-again">2025-02-19 Bots again, cursed</a>.
Basically a request to one of my Oddmuse wikis containing the parameter
<code>rcidonly</code> is an expensive endpoint: “all changes for this
single page” or “a feed for this single page”. This is something a human
would rarely access and yet it somehow the URLs landed in some dataset
for AI training, I suspect. So what I do is I’m redirecting any request
containing “rcidonly” in the query string to <code>/nobots</code>,
warning humans not to click on these links.
</p>
<p>
In addition to that, the filter
<code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/alex-bots.conf</code> contains this:
</p>
<pre><code>[Definition]
failregex = ^(www\.emacswiki\.org|communitywiki\.org|campaignwiki\.org):[0-9]+ &lt;HOST&gt; .*rcidonly=
</code></pre>
<p>
And I added a section using this filter to my jail
<code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/alex.conf</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>[alex-bots]
enabled = true
port    = http,https
logpath = %(apache_access_log)s
findtime = 3600
maxretry = 2
</code></pre>
<p>
So if an IP number visits three URLs containing “rcidonly” in an hour,
they get banned for ten minutes.
</p>
<p>
The <code>recidive</code> filter (a standard filter you just need to
activate) then makes sure that any IP number that got blocked three
times gets blocked for a week.

<strong>2025-03-20</strong>. Ever since Drew DeVault published his blog
post, more people seem to notice what’s going on: AI ingestion is
killing web sites and web services.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If you think these crawlers respect <code>robots.txt</code> then you are
several assumptions of good faith removed from reality. These bots crawl
everything they can find, <code>robots.txt</code> be damned, including
expensive endpoints like git blame, every page of every git log, and
every commit in every repo, and they do so using random User-Agents that
overlap with end-users and come from tens of thousands of IP addresses –
mostly residential, in unrelated subnets, each one making no more than
one HTTP request over any time period we tried to measure – actively and
maliciously adapting and blending in with end-user traffic and avoiding
attempts to characterize their behavior or block their traffic. –

Then, yesterday morning, KDE GitLab infrastructure was overwhelmed by
another AI crawler, with IPs from an Alibaba range; this caused GitLab
to be temporarily inaccessible by KDE developers. I then discovered
that, one week ago, an Anime girl started appearing on the GNOME GitLab
instance, as the page was loaded. It turns out that it’s the default

infrastructure is under attack by AI companies</a>, by Niccolò
Venerandi, for LibreNews

<p>
What do SourceHut, GNOME’s GitLab, and KDE’s GitLab have in common,
other than all three of them being forges? Well, it turns out all three
of them have been dealing with immense amounts of traffic from “AI”
scrapers, who are effectively performing DDoS attacks with such ferocity
it’s bringing down the infrastructures of these major open source
projects. Being open source, and thus publicly accessible, means these
scrapers have unlimited access, unlike with proprietary projects. …
Everything about this “AI” bubble is gross, and I can’t wait for this
bubble to pop so a semblance of sanity can return to the technology
world. Until the next hype train rolls into the station, of course. –

<a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67dd5fa5d278819192d9fca03485723f-wordland-support">something</a>
that could be useful. A ChatGPT with instructions on how to help a user
with <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>. Try clicking the
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67dd5fa5d278819192d9fca03485723f-wordland-support">link</a>
and see what happens, esp if you’re a regular WordLand user. I
discovered the feature first by asking if the bot knew what WordLand
was, and it said it did, and got it mostly right. I’ve been using
ChatGPT to develop the product, so it’s possible it has retained some of
the info. And the <a href="https://this.how/wordland/">docs</a> are on
the web. This is one of those times when you really want the AI bot to
ingest everything it can find. Worried about hallucinations. But with a
product like WordLand, which could show up problems in the browser or a
WordPress theme, a lot of the help requests are not problems with
WordLand itself. Here’s a
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/wordlandSupport/issues/62">thread</a>
where you can report on your experience. Remember the

<ul>
<li>
Terminology: I don’t thnk we should use the term <i>social web</i> until
there actually is such a thing, so I invented a new term for these
twitter-like services.
</li>
<li>
Since Ghost is now supporting ActivityPub, I felt we needed to include
Substack because the two products compete directly.
</li>
<li>
I consider AT Proto a proprietary protocol for now, as proprietary as
Mastodon’s API.

<li>
I included WordPress because it supports ActivityPub.

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A sophisticated cascading supply chain attack has compromised multiple
GitHub Actions, exposing critical CI/CD secrets across tens of thousands
of repositories. The attack, which originally targeted the widely used
“tj-actions/changed-files” utility, is now believed to have originated
from an earlier breach of the “reviewdog/action-setup@v1” GitHub Action,
according to a report.
</p>
<p>
[…]
</p>
<p>
CISA confirmed the vulnerability has been patched in version 46.0.1.
</p>
<p>
Given that the utility is used by more than 23,000 GitHub repositories,
the scale of potential impact has raised significant alarm throughout
the developer community…

<p>date: 2025-03-20, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
If you aren’t sure how to ask for help with software, try first asking
ChatGPT or another AI chatbot to help figure out what’s going wrong. It
has infinite time to help, and won’t mind if the problem turned out to
be a random browser plug-in that was misbehaving.
</p>
<p>
It often suggests trying things you might not have thought of.
</p>
<p>
I use it myself esp as often is the case there’s no one who can or is
willing to work for me for free. I’m already playing it $20 per month,
and for that I get as much time as it takes.
</p>
<p>
Really good for organizing your approach to a problem.

<blockquote>
Bitcoin blocks now have a theoretical maximum size of 4 megabytes and a
more realistic maximum size of 2 megabytes

Thus the rate at which transactions are included in blocks is limited to
an average of around 7 per second. The chart shows the number of
transactions included in a block each day for the same period. Note that
the day of the fee spike Bitcoin processed 42% of the average of the
three days before and three days after. The variance of the transaction
rate is high. For example, on 7<sup>th</sup> September the blockchain
processed 76% more transactions than the average of the three following

Because the rate at which transactions arrive in the mempool is variable
but the rate at which they leave is capped, even transactions with miner
fees suffer a variable delay before being included in a block. Miners
choose the most profitable transactions to include. This chart shows the
median transaction wait time in minutes over the same period. Note that
on average they wait about one block time, but that on 6<sup>th</sup>
June they waited much less time.<br /> <br />

The distribution of wait times is highly skewed, with a long tail of
low-value transactions. This chart shows the average wait time for
transactions with fees, expressed as a multiple of the median wait time.
Note the ramp up in average wait time ratio, peaking the day after the
fee spike.<br /> <br /> The ratio between median and average wait times
implies that the spike in the average value of transactions on
6<sup>th</sup> June, coming on top of the ramp in transactions waiting
in the mempool from 1<sup>st</sup> June, caused a build-up of low-value
transactions, which suffered massive delays as the miners chose the
transactions with higher value and fees.<br /> <br /> In 2017’s

It definitely tempts people into ether. This is the biggest problem with
bitcoin, it’s not just that it’s expensive to transact, it’s
<i>uncertain</i> to transact. It’s hard to know if you’ve put enough of
a fee. So if you significantly over pay to get in, even then it’s not
guaranteed. There are a lot of people who don’t know how to set their
fees, and it takes hours to confirm transactions. It’s a bad system and
no one has any solutions.

Transactions which fail to get the attention of miners sit in limbo
until they drop out. But the suspended state leaves payers entirely
helpless. They can’t risk resending the transaction, in case the
original one does clear eventually. They can’t recall the original one
either. Our source says he’s had a significant sized transaction waiting
to be settled for two weeks.

<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/scripting.com/post/3lkqf4hrkc22e">on

web</a>, was overtaken by Twitter and why, which boils down to this –
the reading platforms wouldn’t work with each other. So Twitter made
subscription one click. And RSS made sites include 25 buttons to give
people one-click subscription in every popular feed reader. Twitter only
needed one button. And it worked every time. Now, 18 years later, the
twitter-like systems world, Mastodon, Threads, Substack, Ghost, Bluesky,
etc mostly can’t get together on a simple way to peer. They keep talking
about it and while they do, we’re losing everything that’s important to
us. In the open tech world we have the same problem as the Democratic
Party and the same problem RSS had. We refuse to see how the world has
changed, and our slow and steady approach leads nowhere fast. We can’t
all be masters of our own silo’d domain. We need a web for words that’s
simple and can be learned in an afternoon, but doesn’t lose the
essential features writers need. I don’t know what we need to win, but I
do know what we need to get started.</p>

Nichols’ piece</a>, but I don’t agree that
<a href="http://scripting.com/2025/03/13/132830.html">the writer’s
web</a> is blogging. I think it’s bigger. Blogging is <i>part</i> of the
writer’s web. Today’s writing network is much more powerful, the
software tools are stronger, and new UI standards have evolved. Things
like Digital Ocean, Markdown, Font-Awesome and Node.js didn’t exist last
time we took a serious look at writing on the web. The web with all its
features is still here. WordPress has created a strong foundation to
build on, at least as good as the social media platforms, but better
because it’s of the web, with <i>no limits. </i>We’ve got the beginning
of a new platform, one where developers compete to create great writing
and reading environments, and we don’t need federation because the web
takes care of that.</p>

<p>The basic thing about tech is that attracts people who take things
that don’t belong to them. There’s no policing. The richest people are
the ones who are best at grabbing control of other people’s creations.
That’s the common theme. Now they’re in DC, going for all of it. The
whole thing. But they’re like the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWeh4A600E0">dog that catches

they’re taking. How could they? It’s incomprehensibly vast.</p>

2025-03-19 Grounding myself
</h1>
<p>
The powerlessness when reading the news makes me think that perhaps I
need to read even less news, shut it all out.
</p>
<p>
I also find a new appreciation for all of my ancestors who bore children
and raised them even though their world seems like a hellscape compared
to what I’m seeing.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes I wish I could just go to church and sing and pray and it
would all be good again. Except it don’t believe in it.
</p>
<p>
So all I have is plants and animals to care for. In a somewhat unhealthy
(?) relationship with life around me I find that I put plants where they
need me to water them, and find solace in the fact that they at least
are unperturbed by everything and are just happy for me to be there and
tend them. It feels a bit like an artificial dependent relationship so I
dunno, it’s weird.
</p>
<p>
When I see happy dogs and their owners I keep thinking that a dog that’s
so happy to see me, to fetch that ball, to for that walk, this happiness
is real, and they are grounded in life and the present moment.
</p>
<p>
I want back this ignorant bliss of childhood, some days.
</p>
<p>
I have no illusions. While I grew up, Iran and Iraq were at war; the
Moçambique and Angolan wars of independence turned into civil wars;
Yugoslavia fell apart in civil war. Those are the conflicts I remember,
in any case. Life and the news wasn’t great. I just didn’t know.

an idea of the structures we’re working with. It’s basically a WordPress
post with added metadata. They have these kinds of structures in RSS,
Atom, ActivityPub and AT Proto. Eventually some of these will die out,
there are too many formats to support. At any moment in time it feels
like each one is enormous and permanent. But show me where the new OS/2,
Novell, UCSD Pascal or CP/M apps are. Go back far enough, Alogol,
Smalltalk, Lisp, Simula. I am very much a less-is-more type protocol
designer, don’t try to plan for things you don’t have a working model
of, because the ideas you gain when you actually put the app together
will work much better. And only add things you’re willing to live with
forever. Slow down to hurry up. Etc. Anyway,

<h2 id="enshittification-as-a-matter-of-taste">Enshittification as a
matter of taste</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-19, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
“Enshittification” is a termed coined by Cory Doctorow in 2023 to
describe a pattern of decreasing quality observed in online services and
products. Since Doctorow’s post, there’s been no shortage of think
pieces on enshittification and its role in our society and to a large
extent I agree with them all. I think it’s an inevitable problem that
shows the splitting seams of Capitalism. If you will allow, I’d like to
add a tangential thought – one slight embellishment – to this topic.
</p>
<p>
To me, enshittification means that a person who lacks taste was put in a
position of power.
</p>
<p>
Everyone knows ads on the internet suck. But ads also pay bills and help
keep the lights on in newsrooms. When a website adds one
(privacy-preserving) ad to a website, I say “Okay”. Two, I permit it.
Three, I say “Easy now” but still scroll through unencumbered. But when
the website adds a fifth, seventh, twelfth ad… I know a person who lacks
taste is at the wheel. I can feel it in my bones when an app or website
has prioritized revenue over user experience. A person without taste or
high emotional intelligence broke the unspoken contract we had built on
mutual respect.
</p>
<p>
When you read about the development of the iPhone in books like Ken
Kocienda’s <em>Creative Selection</em> or Tony Fadell’s <em>Build</em>,
you understand Steve Jobs’ superpower wasn’t so much that he possessed a
reality distortion field, but that he was a great editor. He could find
the good ideas in a pile of prototypes and say “no” (harshly, I’ve read)
to the less-than-great ideas. You need a person with taste in the
decision making process.
<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino">When
we see giants falter</a>, it’s a lack of taste shining through.
</p>
<p>
Going forward, I think taste and style are more valuable than ever
before. In an era where we’re able to rapidly generate cheap low quality
content or software at a scale we’ve never seen before,
<a href="https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/elizabeth-goodspeed-column-taste-technology-art-280224">we
will need people with taste in the mix</a>. We’ll need aggregators to
dive in the dumpsters for the treasure. We’ll need people who know how
to zig when everyone is using the Zag-o-tron 9000. We’ll need people who
can offer critique and say “no” when the
“<a href="https://derekkedziora.com/notes/2024-12-11-an-llms-not-going-to-tell-you-no">yes
yes always more</a>” machine barrels through town and begins knocking
down institutions.

I’m giving <a href="https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri">niri</a> a go. The
idea is that a scrollable tiling window manager (“Wayland compositor”)
is a better fit than just a tiling window manager. For tiling window
managers, I just create new stuff and have it maximized. I really can’t
do the quick splitting and rearranging that it seems to afford. The
result is that I start moving stuff to other workspaces, where they’re
invisible and gone. I’m hoping that new windows popping up next to
existing windows makes it feel like a stack.
</p>
<p>
Having gone through the config file and having made a few small changes
it already feels pretty nice. Right now one of the problems I have is
that by sheer bad luck I decided to rotate my external monitor by 90°
and that doesn’t work quite as well, maybe? I’m not sure. One of the
first changes I did was change the default widths from ⅓ / ½ / ⅔ to 0.95
/ ⅔ / ½ with 0.95 being the default.

I didn’t find a solution for Gimp. And I already had no solution for
VASSAL under Sway. So for these applications, I still have Gnome
installed.
</p>
<p>
Currently my <code>~/.config/fish/conf.d/window-manager.fish</code>
says:
</p>
<pre><code># If running from tty1 start sway
set TTY (tty)
[ &quot;$TTY&quot; = &quot;/dev/tty1&quot; ] &amp;&amp; exec sway
[ &quot;$TTY&quot; = &quot;/dev/tty2&quot; ] &amp;&amp; exec startx
[ &quot;$TTY&quot; = &quot;/dev/tty3&quot; ] &amp;&amp; exec niri
</code></pre>
<p>
Oh well. 😅
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-03-19</strong>. I’m finding that there were too many
problems with apps that didn’t work or had very slow startup times. So
I’m back to <a href="2023-10-22-sway">using Sway</a>.

<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
This is like that moment, five years ago, when we realized that Covid
was going to kill a lot of us but it hadn’t happened yet. A lot of
people weren’t yet aware. My
<a href="http://scripting.com/images/2024/10/02/palfrey2003.jpeg">friend</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Palfrey">John Palfrey</a>,
who is a legal scholar, has been writing about this moment on LinkedIn
and Facebook. Things are flashing by very quickly, so I’m going to
publish his latest piece here, below, so it gets a chance to get to the
places I’m hooked into.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Lawyer friends and non-lawyer friends: has it become hard to say out
loud in public: “we believe in the rule of law in America”? That seems
not remotely controversial as a concept. The relative quiet on this
topic is what is striking me most at the moment.
</li>
<li>
It would be a good idea for our Republic to avoid sleepwalking through a
Constitutional crisis. Of course there are extremely talented lawyers
working overtime on many fronts. Those who are not directly involved in
litigation have other tools, including voice and funding and organizing,
to make plain the simple truth that we should not let the rule of law
slip away in America bit by bit. That will continue to happen if the
rulings of federal judges can simply be ignored or sidestepped with
impunity.
</li>
<li>
If the legislature has abdicated its role in checking the power of the
executive, and then the judicial branch is also out, well, that leaves
just one. This is not “fancy law stuff”. This is “4th grade civics
stuff” – separation of powers, checks and balances (I know, I know, we
don’t teach civics enough in America…).
</li>
<li>
It is actually <em>not</em> more complicated than that. It can’t be that
hard to say out loud: “we value the rule of law in America” – no matter
your politics or party.
</li>
</ul>

<p>date: 2025-03-18, updated: 2025-03-17, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Really interesting research:
“<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24/presentation/hasegawa">How
WEIRD is Usable Privacy and Security Research?</a>” by Ayako A. Hasegawa
Daisuke Inoue, and Mitsuaki Akiyama:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Abstract</b>: In human factor fields such as human-computer
interaction (HCI) and psychology, researchers have been concerned that
participants mostly come from WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized,
Rich, and Democratic) countries. This WEIRD skew may hinder
understanding of diverse populations and their cultural differences. The
usable privacy and security (UPS) field has inherited many research
methodologies from research on human factor fields. We conducted a
literature review to understand the extent to which participant samples
in UPS papers were from WEIRD countries and the characteristics of the
methodologies and research topics in each user study recruiting Western
or non-Western participants. We found that the skew toward WEIRD
countries in UPS is greater than that in HCI. Geographic and linguistic
barriers in the study methods and recruitment methods may cause
researchers to conduct user studies locally. In addition, many papers
did not report participant demographics, which could hinder the
replication of the reported studies, leading to low reproducibility. To
improve geographic diversity, we provide the suggestions including
facilitate replication studies, address geographic and linguistic issues
of study/recruitment methods, and facilitate research on the topics for
non-WEIRD populations…

Philosophers</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Jessica Smith’s blog</p>
<p>
About a month ago,
<a href="https://www.jayeless.net/2025/02/indies-first-library-trip.html" title="Blog post from 15 Feb: Indie&#39;s First Library Trip">I
mentioned</a> that we’d borrowed a book from this “Big Ideas for Little
Philosophers” series called <cite>Love with Plato</cite>. Even though I
made fun of it at the time, it actually struck me as a really nice
little book, and since I was curious about what they would say about the
other philosophers, I shelled out to order the whole series:

<p>
I’m pleased to be able to offer a <em>positive</em> baby book review.
While I don’t think the books in this series have all accurately
outlined the core theses of their respective philosophers, they
<em>are</em> all really good, thoughtful books that invite kids to
grapple with questions about how we can be good and happy people.
</p>
<p>
I mentioned last time that I wished the library had had <cite>Equality
with Simone de Beauvoir</cite>, and that <em>is</em> one of my
favourites, now that I’ve read it. It explains, in very “small
child”-friendly language, that gender stereotypes are completely
artificial, that girls and boys are really much the same (we all cry
when we’re sad, and smile when we’re happy…), and that everyone is
happier when we can be our true selves without judgement. On one page
there is also a cute cat rockin’ out with a walkman and a hula hoop in
the corner, so the book gets bonus points for that.
</p>
<p>
But then the one that really surprised me was <cite>Happiness with
Aristotle</cite>, which actually got into a deep rumination on
friendship and what it means to be a “true friend” that I think many
adults would benefit from reading. It talks about how some friends make
you laugh and feel good to spend time with, and other friends will help
you out when you need a hand, but a <em>true</em> friend is actually
someone who’ll call you out on your shit, so you can grow as a person.
(Again, in kid-friendly language.) Not only that, but the book added
that before you can be a “true friend” to others, you need to be a “true
friend” to yourself, which means “loving yourself as much as you love
your friends”. Like… damn! Where was this book when I was 18–19 and
stuck in “I can fix him!” thinking? It’s so good! Again, I’m not sure
it’s an accurate description of the very core of Aristotelian
philosophy, but it’s a great message.
</p>
<p>
The books are board books (you know, the hard cardboard ones usually
intended for real babies), but they’re full of open-ended questions to
elicit discussion with a small child. I would love to read these with
Indie when she’s, like, five and actually able to engage with the ideas
therein. I’m glad to have bought our own copies, because I think we’ll
get a lot of mileage out of them.
</p>
<p>
Having said this, the series <strong>is</strong> clearly missing a book
about one very important philosopher, one they could call something like
<cite>Communism with Marx</cite>. I guess we just can’t have it all 😔

I just discovered that there was a difference between GREEK SMALL LETTER
MU (μ) and MICRO SIGN (μ), resulting in these two hashtags on my blog to
return different results:
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Oddµ">#Oddµ</a>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Oddμ">#Oddμ</a> 😭 Ironically, I was
tricked by the compose key M U sequence into thinking that the result
was a mu but in fact it’s the micro sign. I had to go through the whole
blog, fixing this.

Attacks</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-17, updated: 2025-03-17, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
New paper:
“<a href="https://tosc.iacr.org/index.php/ToSC/article/view/12078/11919">GPU
Assisted Brute Force Cryptanalysis of GPRS, GSM, RFID, and TETRA: Brute
Force Cryptanalysis of KASUMI, SPECK, and TEA3</a>.”
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b> Key lengths in symmetric cryptography are determined
with respect to the brute force attacks with current technology. While
nowadays at least 128-bit keys are recommended, there are many standards
and real-world applications that use shorter keys. In order to estimate
the actual threat imposed by using those short keys, precise estimates
for attacks are crucial.
</p>
<p>
In this work we provide optimized implementations of several widely used
algorithms on GPUs, leading to interesting insights on the cost of brute
force attacks on several real-word applications…

<p>Poking around on old servers I found
<a href="http://jsonify.scripting.com/?url=http://scripting.com/rss.xml">this
cute little app</a> that jsonifies an RSS feed. Not sure why I did it.
Postscript, it only works for one feed, mine. I replaced it with a
template in the feeder app which was a useful version of the cute little
app. Here’s a

<h2 id="blogging-is-due-for-a-refresh">Blogging is due for a
refresh</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-16, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
A lot has changed since the last time we took a serious look at
blogging. A few items, as examples.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
When RSS came along Markdown didn’t exist. The two technologies belong
together, imho.
</li>
<li>
Websockets have replaced long polling.
</li>
<li>
Servers got cheap! (and easy to deploy).
</li>
<li>
SQL is fast and the tools are much better.
</li>
<li>
The user interfaces of all the Web 2.0+ products didn’t exist last time
we created new blogging communities. We can borrow ideas from
twitter-like systems, even huge products like Facebook and Spotify have
innovations that come long after the initial wave of blogging.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
But one thing stays the same – all the components are replaceable.
Absolutely zero lock-in. We use simple standard APIs where they exist,
and create new minimal formats and protocols where they don’t.
</p>
<p>
Blogging has a simple philosophy that remains constant.

<p>
Today I saw somebody posting a message about Trump’s threats to annex
Canada from a friend that wanted to remain anonymous. It seems pretty
important to me because that’s how every former friend of the US is
going to react. Greenland is an autonomous territory in the Kingdom of
Denmark. Denmark is part of Europe. Denmark spent a lot to support
Ukraine. The USA threatened to abandon Ukraine. Both Denmark and Canada
are part of NATO. The USA is not behaving like a friend and ally. Not at
all.
</p>
<p>
Trump is a Russian asset.
</p>
<p>
People will remember.
</p>
<p>
For reference, aid to Ukraine:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
The US has contributed $69bn, Europe has contributed $66bn, the biggest
contributors being Germany with $13.6bn, UK with $10.8bn, Denmark with
$8.1bn, and so on. Source:

</p>
<p>
Here’s the message I mentioned at the top:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
One thing I’ve learned over the past few weeks, and it’s been a bit of a
sobering lesson, is that a lot of Americans I know don’t actually know
what’s going on between the US and Canada right now, and just how
seriously Canadians are taking this. So, against my better judgement,
here’s a timeline to explain why we’re here, and why we’re angry.
</p>
<p>
Nov 30th, 2018. The United States, Canada and Mexico finalize a trade
agreement. Trump personally negotiates the terms and signs the document,
celebrating it as ‘the greatest trade agreement in history”. (This is
important.)
</p>
<p>
Nov 29th, 2024. In a face to face meeting, Trump threatens the Canadian
Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, that he will be imposing 25% tariffs and
that if Canada wants to avoid that, it should join the US as a state.
</p>
<p>
Nov 30th, 2024. Trump publicly calls our Prime Minister ‘Governor
Trudeau’ and instructs his staff to only address him as Governor going
forward. He again suggests Canada should join the USA.
</p>
<p>
Dec 3rd, 2024. Trump remarks that he would split Canada into two states
once annexed.
</p>
<p>
Dec 10th, 2024. Trump posts that the majority of Canadians support
annexation, despite public polling that only 13% of Canadians would
consider the idea.
</p>
<p>
Dec 18th, 2024. Trump again falsely states that the majority of
Canadians support annexation and that one of his lapdogs, Wayne Gretzky,
should have a leadership role in that new scenario.
</p>
<p>
Jan 7th, 2025. At a press conference, Trump says that he would use
economic force to destroy the Canadian economy to annex it.
</p>
<p>
Jan 14, 2025. Trump again claims that most Canadians want to be
American, despite new polls showing only 10% of us are open to the idea.
</p>
<p>
Jan 20th, 2025. During his inaugural address, Trump says that the U.S.
will ‘expand its territory’ during his second term.
</p>
<p>
Jan 23rd, 2025. At the World Economic Forum, Trump says that Canada can
avoid tariffs and economic collapse if it joins the US. He says this in
front of representatives from most countries in the world.
</p>
<p>
Jan 24th, 2025. Trump states publicly that Canada ‘will’ become a state
</p>
<p>
Jan 31st, 2025. Trump announces a 25% tariff on all Canadian imports to
begin the next day.
</p>
<p>
Feb 2nd, 2025. Trump refers to Canada as its ‘Cherished 51st state’ and
that it should join the US to avoid tariffs.
</p>
<p>
Feb 3rd, 2025. A one month delay is agreed upon. Trump, in a
conversation with Trudeau states that he doesn’t think existing border
treaties with Canada are valid, and need to be revised.
</p>
<p>
Feb 7th, 2025. In a closed door meeting with his cabinet, Prime Minister
Trudeau is recorded, without his knowledge, telling everyone that he
believes very strongly that Trump is serious and that he stated his
reason for annexation as Canadian resources.
</p>
<p>
Feb 9th, 2025. In a Super Bowl pre-game interview, Trump says that he’s
serious about his threats, calling it a ‘viable consideration for
expanding US territory’
</p>
<p>
Feb 10th, 2025. Trump announces an additional 25% tariffs on steel and
aluminum imports from Canada to come into effect March 12th.
</p>
<p>
Feb 24th, 2025. Trump publicly remarks that whoever signed the USMCA
agreement is an idiot. He was the one that signed it.
</p>
<p>
March 4th, 5th, and 6th 2025. Tariffs come into effect. Canada
retaliates with it’s own tariffs. Tariffs are again postponed until
April 1st after a huge market backlash.
</p>
<p>
March 4th, 2025. In an address to a joint session of congress, Trump
states that the US will own Greenland ‘one way or the other’.
</p>
<p>
March 5th, 2025. US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick told Canadian
finance minister Dominic LeBlanc that Trump “had come to realize that
the relationship between the United States and Canada was governed by a
slew of agreements and treaties that were easy to abandon.”
</p>
<p>
March 7th, 2025. Unconfirmed Memorandum and maps leaked on twitter
reveal Trump is allegedly planning to annex the entirety of the great
lakes and Southern Ontario, home to 13,491,332 Canadians. This amounts
to 35.25% of Canada’s total population and includes its largest city,
Toronto. This region accounts for 38% of the Canadian economy, and its
loss would make Canada’s independence functionally impossible.
</p>
<p>
March 8th, 2025. Canada’s foreign minister warns European allies that
their government considers Canada to be under existential threat.
</p>
<p>
March 9th, 2025. Mark Carney, the new Canadian Prime Minister, in his
acceptance speech, states that Trump is seeking to destroy Canada, and
its way of life.
</p>
<p>
March 11, 2025. President Trump threatens to “permanently shut down the
automobile manufacturing business in Canada” if Canada does not drop a
250% to 390% tariff on U.S. dairy products, which he doesn’t state only
kicks in after a certain quantity of tariff-free U.S. dairy enters
Canada, a quantity that was originally negotiated and agreed to by Trump
during the USMCA in 2018.
</p>
<p>
In Trump’s own words, “The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to
become our cherished Fifty First State. This would make all Tariffs, and
everything else, totally disappear.
</p>
<p>
Canadians’ taxes will be very substantially reduced, they will be more
secure, militarily and otherwise, than ever before, there would no
longer be a Northern Border problem, and the greatest and most powerful
nation in the World will be bigger, better and stronger than ever — And
Canada will be a big part of that. The artificial line of separation
drawn many years ago will finally disappear, and we will have the safest
and most beautiful Nation anywhere in the World — And your brilliant
anthem, “O Canada,” will continue to play, but now representing a GREAT
and POWERFUL STATE within the greatest Nation that the World has ever
seen!”
</p>
<p>
March 11th, 2025 PT. II. Peter Navarro, a Senior Advisor for Trump is
interviewed by MSNBC. When asked about the tariffs he responds with
“Just tamp it down, please, over there, ok? They’re throwing down the
hockey gloves. Stop that rhetoric…we’re not going to tolerate anything
but them stopping killing Americans”, insinuating that this situation
was caused by Canadians killing Americans.
</p>
<p>
March 11th, 2025 PT III. Trump again publicly muses that Canada,
Greenland, and the US should be one country, and questions the validity
of the Canadian and American border.
</p>
<p>
To my American friends, I know most of you are amazing and generous
people. You didn’t ask for this, and I understand that. I hold no ill
will towards you, whatsoever. But I must stress, with as much
seriousness as I can, the amount of damage this has done.
</p>
<p>
We have viewed you as our closest friend and ally for a century. We
thought of you as brothers and sisters. We answered the call, again and
again, for any support you needed from us. Most of Canadians visit the
USA so much that we’ve seen more of the US than we have the rest of
Canada.
</p>
<p>
American products have been taken off our shelves. Canadians are
cancelling travel plans to the US. Photo after photo has been shared on
social media of empty flights from Canada to the USA.
</p>
<p>
This isn’t a joke to us. We’re not overreacting. We don’t think he’s
just saying this shit to cause chaos or negotiate a deal. We
wholeheartedly believe that our closest ally and friend is about to
bring violence across our border, economically destroy us, and eliminate
our way of life.
</p>
<p>
The main driver for Canada’s creation in 1867 was SPECIFICALLY to not be
part of America, and to end America’s very public threats and plans to
annex our territory.
</p>
<p>
We’re angry. We’re really, really fucking angry. Open your eyes to
what’s happening because we’re tired of trying to make you understand
why and asking you why it seems like none of you care. **
</p>
<p>
I still hope that there is time to repair this. I still believe that
this is the result of one man’s plan to burn it all down. But time is
running out, and fast.

<p>I’d love to get a list of old school bloggers who are still at it.
How would you go about that? I decided to give it to Gemini, limiting it
at first to 100 bloggers. Here’s the
<a href="https://daveverse.wordpress.com/2025/03/15/finding-old-school-bloggers-who-are-still-at-it/">prompt</a>
I wrote. For a while I was wondering what “deep research” was for, but
as it’s starting the work, I’m thinking of resources that would fit in –
like blogtree.com – a fascinating site, gives a clear picture how blogs
emerge out of the community of an earlier blog. Anyway it’s working on
it while I write this post. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>

<p>An application ChatGPT is great it. You’re staring at some code, it’s
really straightforward, you’ve done this a thousand times, but it
doesn’t work. Stare at it some more. Try re-entering it. Change the
names of things. Still doesn’t work. Copy and paste the problem code
into ChatGPT and in an instant it tells you without you even having to
ask that your comment isn’t properly terminated, so the runtime was
never seeing the code, and nothing I did made the slightest difference.
The information was there. I had been staring at it, but humans see what
we expect to see. Machines don’t have that problem, at least not in this
way (thinking of hallucinations).</p>

<p>I asked
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67d580b2-8a68-8012-ad1a-65f2553978bb">ChatGPT</a>
when Google started making HTTPS a requirement. Then I asked when was
HTTPS first deployed, and was surprised it was in 1994 in Netscape
Navigator. But apparently it was really buggy and wasn’t codified until
much later. Then I asked when HTTPS became the norm? 2017. So there’s a
lot of web out there that isn’t being maintained by anyone, it just
works, that predates HTTPS being widely adopted, if you believe the
timelines ChatGPT produced.</p>

is scripting.com not https? I hope you can see that I have no trouble
deploying https sites here. I use
<a href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy</a> on my Linux servers, and I
don’t see why anyone uses anything else. It’s really easy and requires
none of the work people complain about. Anyway the reason scripting.com
is http and not https is that the site dates back to 1994, before there
was such a thing as https. Google didn’t start their push to get the web
to convert to https until 2014, 20 years after I started blogging. Have
a look at <a href="http://scripting.com/1999/12/31.html">any</a> of

<a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1999/05/24/editThisPage.html">posts</a>
and <a href="http://scripting.com/frontier/olddefault.html">docs</a>,
the’re pretty much all there. This is something I’m proud of. I wanted
to create a record from the start, it was very deliberate. I was already
an experienced developer when the web started up, so I had an idea what
I was doing. I also use images on my site, in the right margin of posts,
and lately as “inline” images, in their own boxes with a caption. It’s a
way for me to play with the ideas, and adds color to pages that are
almost all text. So if I were to move the site from S3 to one of my
hosted servers, which would be a fairly major undertaking on its own and
add a lot of overhead because Amazon takes care of a lot of the bullshit
you have to deal with, there would be a small matter of what about the
images? They would all break if scripting.com was hosted on https and
they were served from http. Now you might say – Dave all you have to do
is move all those images to a place with https support and remap the
domains, and take care of all the michegas that’s going to pop up. Or
suffer with broken images. I decided to instead tell Google to stop
trying to own something that belongs to no one and everyone. If they
want a more secure web, create it, and make a browser for it, and
respect the original web alone. Hopefully this clears it up.</p>

Introduction
</h2>
I’m honored to appear in what I believe is the final series of these
seminars. Most of my previous appearances have focused on debunking some
conventional wisdom, and this one is no exception. My parting gift to
you is to stop you wasting time and resources on yet another seductive
but impractical idea — that the solution to storing archival data is
quasi-immortal media. As usual, you don’t have to take notes. The full
text of my talk with the slides and links to the sources will go up on
my blog shortly after the seminar.<br />

Archival data is often confused with backup data. Everyone should back
up their data. After nearly two decades working in digital preservation,
here is how I back up my four important systems:<br />
<ul>
<li>
I run my own mail and Web server. It is on my DMZ network, exposed to
the Internet. It is backed up to a Raspberry Pi, also on the DMZ network
but not directly accessible from the Internet. Once a week there is a
full backup, and daily an incremental backup. Every week the full and
incremental backups for the week are written to two DVD-Rs.
</li>
<li>
My desktop PC creates a full backup on an external hard drive nightly.
The drive is one of a cycle of three.
</li>
<li>
I back up my iPhone to my Mac Air laptop every day.
</li>
<li>
I create a Time Machine backup of my Mac Air laptop, which includes the
most recent iPhone backup, every day on one of a cycle of
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/01/a-lesson-learned.html">three
external SSDs</a>.
</li>
</ul>
Each week the DVD-Rs, the current SSD and the current hard drive are
moved off-site. Why am I doing all this? In case of disasters such as
fire or ransomware I want to be able to recover to a state as close as
possible to that before the disaster. In my case, the worst case is not
more than one week.<br /> <br /> Note the implication that the useful
life of backup data is only the time that elapses between the last
backup before a disaster and the recovery. Media life span is irrelevant
to backup data; that is why backups and archiving are <i>completely
different problems</i>.<br /> <br /> The fact that the data encoded in
magnetic grains on the platters of the three hard drives is
<a href="https://www.abitare.org/papers/ISandT2008.pdf">good for a
quarter-century</a> is interesting but irrelevant to the backup
task.<br /> <br />

I have saved many hundreds of pairs of weekly DVD-Rs but the only ones
that are ever accessed more than a few weeks after being written are the
ones I use for my annual series of
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/08/2024-optical-media-durability-update.html"><i>Optical
Media Durability Update</i></a> posts. It is interesting that:<br />
<blockquote>
with no special storage precautions, generic low-cost media, and
consumer drives, I’m getting good data from CD-Rs more than 20 years
old, and from DVD-Rs nearly 18 years old.
</blockquote>
But the DVD-R media lifetime is not why I’m writing backups to them. The
attribute I’m interested in is that DVD-Rs are <i>write-once</i>; the
backup data could be destroyed but it can’t be modified.<br /> <br />
Note that the good data from 18-year-old DVD-Rs means that consumers
have an affordable, effective archival technology. But the market for
optical media and drives is dying, killed off by streaming, which
suggests that consumers don’t really care about archiving their data.
Cathy Marshall’s 2008 talk
<a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/fast08/tech/marshall.pdf"><i>Its
Like A Fire, You Just Have To Move On</i></a> vividly describes this
attitude. Her subtitle is “Rethinking personal digital archiving”.<br />

Archival Data

<ul>
<li>
Over time, data falls down the storage hierarchy.
</li>
<li>
Data is archived when it can’t earn its keep on near-line media.
</li>
<li>
Lower cost is purchased with longer access latency.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
What is a useful definition of archival data? It is data that can no
longer earn its keep on readily accessible storage. Thus the fundamental
design goal for archival storage systems is to reduce costs by
tolerating increased access latency. Data is archived, that is moved to
an archival storage system, to save money. Archiving is an
<i>economic</i> rather than a technical issue.<br /> <br />

How long should the archived data last? The
<a href="https://longnow.org/">Long Now Foundation</a> is building the
<a href="https://longnow.org/clock/">Clock of the Long Now</a>, intended
to keep time for 10,000 years. They would like to accompany it with a
10,000-year archive. That is at least two orders of magnitude longer
than I am talking about here. We are only just over 75 years from the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Baby">first
stored-program computer</a>, so designing a digital archive for a
century is a very ambitious goal.<br />

Six years later, this is a picture of, as far as I know, the only
write-to-read DNA storage drive ever demonstrated. It is from the
Microsoft/University of Washington team that has done much of the
research in DNA storage. They published it in 2019’s
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41228-8"><i>Demonstration of
End-to-End Automation of DNA Data Storage</i></a>. It cost about $10K
and took 21 hours to write then read 5 bytes. <br /> <br /> The
technical press is equally guilty. The canonical article about some
development in the lab starts with the famous IDC graph projecting the
amount of data that will be generated in the future. It goes on to
describe the amazing density some research team achieved by writing say
a gigabyte into their favorite medium in the lab, and how this density
could store all the world’s data in a teacup for ever. This conveys five
false impressions.<br />
<h3>
Market Size
</h3>
First, that there is some possibility the researchers could scale their
process up to a meaningful fraction of IDC’s projected demand, or even
to the microscopic fraction of the projected demand that makes sense to
archive. There is no such possibility. Archival media is a much
<i>smaller</i> market than regular media. In 2018’s

DNA storage, makes it look like the size of the market increases
downwards. But that’s very far from the case.<br />

Georg Lauhoff and Gary M Decad’s slide</a> shows that the size of the
market in dollar terms <i>decreases</i> downwards. LTO tape is less than
1% of the media market in dollar terms and less than 5% in capacity
terms. Archival media are a very small part of the storage market. It is
noteworthy that in 2023 Optical Archival (OD-3), the most recent
archive-only medium, was canceled for lack of a large enough market. It
was a 1TB optical disk, an upgrade from Blu-Ray.<br />

Timescales

Second, that the researcher’s favorite medium could make it into the
market in the timescale of IDC’s projections. Because the reliability
and performance requirements of storage media are so challenging, time
scales in the storage market are much longer than the industry’s
marketeers like to suggest.<br /> <br />

Take, for example, Seagate’s development of the next generation of hard
disk technology, HAMR, where research started
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190813175046/https://www.seagate.com/news/news-archive/seagate-swings-increase-disc-drive-densities-master-pr/">twenty-six
years ago</a>. Nine years later in 2008 they published this graph,
showing HAMR entering the market in 2009. Seventeen years later it is
only now starting to be shipped to the hyper-scalers. Research on data
in silica started
<a href="https://www.storagenewsletter.com/2014/10/31/rd-hitachi-rw-of-digital-data-in-fused-silica-glass/">fifteen
years ago</a>. Research on the DNA medium started
<a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/777811">thirty-six years ago</a>.
Neither is within five years of market entry.<br />
<h3>
Customers

Third, that even if the researcher’s favorite medium did make it into
the market it would be a product that consumers could use. As
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">Kestutis
Patiejunas figured out</a> at Facebook more than a decade ago, because
the systems that surround archival media rather than the media
themselves are the major cost, the only way to make the economics of
archival storage work is to do it at data-center scale but in warehouse
space and harvest the synergies that come from not needing data-center
power, cooling, staffing, etc.<br /> <br />

Storage has an analog of Moore’s Law called
<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/kryders-law/">Kryder’s
Law</a>, which states that over time the density of bits on a storage
medium increases exponentially. Given the need to reduce costs at
data-center scale, Kryder’s Law limits the service life of even
quasi-immortal media. As we see with tape robots, where data is
routinely migrated to newer, denser media long before its theoretical
lifespan, what matters is the economic, not the technical lifespan of a
medium.<br /> <br /> Hard disks are replaced every five years although
the magnetically encoded data on the platters is
<a href="https://www.abitare.org/papers/ISandT2008.pdf">good for a
quarter-century</a>. They are engineered to have a five-year life
because Kryder’s Law implies that they will be replaced after five years
even though they still work perfectly. Seagate actually built drives
with 25-year life but found that no-one would pay the extra for the
longer life.<br />

Fourth, that anyone either cares or even knows what medium their
archived data lives on. Only the hyper-scalers do. Consumers believe
their data is safe in the cloud. Why bother backing it up, let alone
archiving it, if it is safe anyway? If anyone really cares about
archiving they use a service such as Glacier, when they definitely have
no idea what medium is being used.<br />

Fifth, that bit rot is the only threat that matters; the idea that with
quasi-immortal media you don’t need Lots Of Copies to Keep Stuff
Safe.<br /> <br /> No medium is perfect. They all have a specified
Unrecoverable Bit Error Rate (UBER) rate. For example, typical
<a href="https://www.seagate.com/content/dam/seagate/en/content-fragments/products/datasheets/exos-x24/exos-x24-DS2080-2307US-en_US.pdf">disk
UBERs are 10<sup>-15</sup></a>. A petabyte is 8*10<sup>15</sup> bits, so
if the drive is within its specified performance you can expect up to 8
errors when reading a petabyte. The specified UBER is an upper limit,
you will normally see
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2005/12/tr-2005-166.pdf">far
fewer</a>. The
<a href="https://cdn.allbound.com/iq-ab/2022/12/LTO-9-TB00068A.pdf">UBER
for LT09 tape is 10<sup>-20</sup></a>, so unrecoverable errors on a new
tape are very unlikely. But not impossible, and the rate goes up steeply
with tape wear.<br /> <br /> The property that classifies a medium as
quasi-immortal is not that its reliability is greater than regular media
to start with, although as with tape it may be. It is rather that its
reliability decays more slowly than that of regular media. Thus archival
systems need to use erasure coding to mitigate both UBER data loss and
media failures such as disk crashes and tape wear-out.<br /> <br />
Another reason for needing erasure codes is that media errors are not
the only ones needing mitigation. What matters is the reliability the
system delivers to the end user. Research has shown that the
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2008/03/more-bad-news-on-storage-reliability.html">majority
of end user errors</a> come from layers of the system above the actual
media.<br /> <br /> The archive may contain personally identifiable or
other sensitive data. If so, the data on the medium must be encrypted.
This is a double-edged sword, because the encryption key becomes a
single point of failure; its loss or corruption renders the entire
archive inaccessible. So you need Lots Of Copies to keep the key safe.
But the more copies the greater the risk of key compromise.<br /> <br />
Media such as silica, DNA, quartz DVDs, steel tape and so on address bit
rot, which is only one of the threats to which long-lived data is
subject. Clearly a single copy on such media, even if erasure coded, is
still subject to threats including fire, flood, earthquake, ransomware,
and insider attacks. Thus even an archive needs to maintain multiple
copies. This greatly increases the cost, bringing us back to the
economic threat.<br /> <br />
<h2>
Archival Storage Systems
</h2>
At Facebook Patiejunas built rack-scale systems, each holding 10,000
100GB optical disks for a Petabyte per rack. Writable Blu-Ray disks are
about 80 cents each, so the media to fill the rack would cost about $8K.
This is clearly much less than the cost of the robotics and the
drives.<br /> <br />

Let’s drive this point home with another example. An
<a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ts4300">IBM TS4300</a> LTO tape
robot
<a href="https://www.ibm.com/flashsystem/pricing/us-en/family/TP9JK5">starts
at $20K</a>. Two 20-pack tape cartridges to fill it cost about $4K, so
the media is about 16% of the total system capex. The opex for the robot
includes power, cooling, space, staff and an IBM maintenance contract.
The opex for the tapes is essentially zero.<br /> <br /> The media is an
insignificant part of the total lifecycle cost of storing archival data
on tape. What matters for the economic viability of an archival storage
system is minimizing the total system cost, not the cost of the media.
No-one is going to spend $24K on a rack-mount tape system from IBM to
store 720TB for their home or small business. The economics only work at
data-center scale.<br /> <br /> The reason why this focus on media is a
distraction is that the fundamental problem of digital preservation is
economic, not technical. No-one wants to pay for preserving data that
isn’t earning its keep, pretty much the definition of archived data. The
cost per terabyte of the <i>medium</i> is irrelevant, what drives the
economic threat is the capital and operational cost of the
<i>system</i>. Take tape for example. The media capital cost is low, but
the much higher system capital cost includes the drives and the
robotics. Then there are the operational costs of the data center space,
power, cooling and staff. It is only by operating at data-center scale
and thus amortizing the capital and operational costs over very large
amounts of data that the system costs per terabyte can be made
competitive.<br /> <br /> Operating at data center scale, as
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">Patiejunas
discovered</a> and
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2025/01/storage-roundup.html">Microsoft
understands</a>, means that one of the parameters that determines the
system cost is <i>write bandwidth</i>. Each of Facebook’s racks wrote 12
optical disks in parallel almost continuously. It would take over 800
times the time to write an entire disk to fill the rack. At the 8x write
speed it takes
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray#Drive_speeds">22.5
minutes</a> to fill a disk, so it would take around 18,750 minutes to
fill the rack, or about two weeks. It isn’t clear how many racks
Facebook needed simultaneously doing this to keep up with the flow of
user-generated content, but it was likely enough to fill a
reasonable-size warehouse. Similarly, it would take about 8.5 days to
fill the

Project Silica
</h3>
I wrote about
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">Microsoft’s Project
Silica</a> a year ago, in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2024/03/microsofts-archival-storage-research.html"><i>Microsoft’s
Archival Storage Research</i></a>. It uses femtosecond lasers to write
data into platters of silica. Like Facebook’s, the prototype Silica
systems are

<blockquote>
A <i>Silica library</i> is a sequence of contiguous write, read, and
storage racks interconnected by a platter delivery system. Along all
racks there are parallel horizontal rails that span the entire library.
We refer to a side of the library (spanning all racks) as a
<i>panel</i>. A set of <i>free roaming</i> robots called <i>shuttles</i>
are used to move platters between locations.<br /> …<br /> A read rack
contains multiple read drives. Each read drive is independent and has
slots into which platters are inserted and removed. The number of
shuttles active on a panel is limited to twice the number of read drives
in the panel. The write drive is full-rack-sized and writes multiple
platters concurrently.

Their performance evaluation focuses on the ability to respond to read
requests within 15 hours. Their cost evaluation, like Facebook’s,
focuses on the savings from using warehouse-type space to house the
equipment, although is isn’t clear that they have actually done so. The
rest of their cost evaluation is somewhat hand-wavy, as is natural for a
system that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">isn’t yet
in production</a>:<br />
<div
style="background-color: #fff8c6; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px; padding-top: 8px; padding: 8px;">
<blockquote>
The Silica read drives use polarization microscopy, which is a
commoditized technique widely used in many applications and is low-cost.
Currently, system cost in Silica is dominated by the write drives, as
they use femtosecond lasers which are currently expensive and used in
niche applications. … As the Silica technology proliferates, it will
drive up the demand for femtosecond lasers, commoditizing the
technology.
</blockquote>
</div>
I’m skeptical of “commoditizing the technology”. Archival systems are a
niche in the IT market, and one on which companies are loath to spend
money. Realistically, there aren’t going to be a vast number of Silica
write heads. The only customers for systems like Silica are the large
cloud providers, who will be reluctant to commit their archives to
technology owned by a competitor. Unless a mass-market application for
femtosecond lasers emerges, the scope for cost reduction is
limited.<br /> <br /> But the more I think about this technology, which
is still in the lab, the more I think it probably has the best chance of
impacting the market among all the rival archival storage technologies.
Not great, but better than its competitors:<br />
<ul>
<li>
The media is very cheap and very dense, so the effect of Kryder’s Law
economics driving media replacement and thus its economic rather than
technical lifetime is minimal.
</li>
<li>
The media is quasi-immortal and survives benign neglect, so opex once
written is minimal.
</li>
<li>
The media is write-once, and the write and read heads are physically
separate, so the data cannot be encrypted or erased by malware. The long
read latency makes exfiltrating large amounts of data hard.
</li>
<li>
The robotics are simple and highly redundant. Any of the shuttles can
reach any of the platters. They should be much less troublesome than
tape library robotics because, unlike tape, a robot failure only renders
a small fraction of the library inaccessible and is easily repaired.
</li>
<li>
All the technologies needed are in the market now, the only
breakthroughs needed are economic, not technological.
</li>
<li>
The team has worked on improving the write bandwidth which is a critical
issue for archival storage at scale. They can currently write hundreds
of megabytes a second.
</li>
<li>
Like
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">Facebook’s
archival storage technologies</a>, Project Silica enjoys the synergies
of data center scale without needing full data center environmental and
power resources.
</li>
<li>
Like Facebook’s technologies, Project Silica has an in-house customer,
Azure’s archival storage, with a need for a product like this.

The Svalbard archipelago is where I spent the summer of 1969 doing a
geological survey.<br /> <br /> The most important part of an archiving
strategy is knowing how you will get stuff out of the archive. Putting
stuff in and keeping it safe are important and relatively easy, but if
you can’t get stuff out when you need it what’s the point?<br /> <br />
In some cases access is only needed to a small proportion of the
archive. At Facebook, Patiejunas expected that the major reason for
access would be to respond to a subpoena. In other cases, such as
migrating to a new archival system, bulk data retrieval is
required.<br /> <br /> But if the reason for needing access is disaster
recovery it is important to have a vision of what resources are likley
to be available after the disaster. Microsoft gained a lot of
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-11-13/microsoft-apocalypse-proofs-open-source-code-in-an-arctic-cave">valuable
PR</a> by encoding much of the world’s open source software in QR codes
on film and storing the cans of film in an abandoned coal mine in
Svalbard so it would “survive the apocalypse”. In
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2019/11/seeds-or-code.html"><i>Seeds Or
Code?</i></a> I had a lot of fun imagining how the survivors of the
apocalypse would be able to access the archive.<br /> <br />

To make a long story short, after even a mild apocalypse, they wouldn’t
be able to. Let’s just point out that the first steps after the
apocalypse are getting to Svalbard. They won’t be able to fly to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard_Airport">LYR</a>. As the
crow flies, the voyage from Tromsø is 591 miles across very stormy seas.
It takes several days, and getting to Tromsø won’t be easy either.<br />

Archival Storage Services
</h2>
Because technologies have very strong economies of scale, the economics
of most forms of IT work in favor of the hyper-scalers. These forces are
especially strong for archival data, both because it is almost pure cost
with no income, and because as I discussed earlier the economics of
archival storage only work at data-center scale. It will be the rare
institution that can avoid using cloud archival storage. I analyzed the
way these economic forces operate in 2019’s
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2019/02/cloud-for-preservation.html"><i>Cloud
For Preservation</i></a>:<br />
<div
style="background-color: #fff8c6; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px; padding-top: 8px; padding: 8px;">
<blockquote>
Much of the attraction of cloud technology for organizations, especially
public institutions funded through a government’s annual budget process,
is that they transfer costs from capital to operational expenditure. It
is easy to believe that this increases financial flexibility. As regards
ingest and dissemination, this may be true. Ingesting some items can be
delayed to the next budget cycle, or the access rate limit lowered
temporarily. But as regards preservation, it isn’t true. It is unlikely
that parts of the institution’s collection can be de-accessioned in a
budget crunch, only to be re-accessioned later when funds are adequate.
Even were the content still available to be re-ingested, the cost of
ingest is a significant fraction of the total life-cycle cost of
preserving digital content.
</blockquote>
</div>
Cloud services typically charge differently for ingest, storage and
retrieval. The service’s goal in designing their pricing structure is to
create lock-in, by analogy with the drug-dealer’s algorithm “the first
one’s free”. In 2019 I used the published rates to compute the cost of
ingesting in a month, storing for a year, and retrieving in a month a
petabyte using the archive services of the three main cloud providers.
Here is that table, with the costs adjusted for inflation to 2024 using
the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">Bureau
of Labor Statistics’ calculator</a>:<br />

The “Lock-in” column is the approximate number of months of storage cost
that getting the Petabyte out in a month represents. Note that:<br />
<ul>
<li>
In all cases getting data out is much more expensive than putting it in.
</li>
<li>
The lower cost of archival storage compared to the same service’s
near-line storage is purchased at the expense of a much stronger
lock-in.
</li>
<li>
Since the whole point of archival storage is keeping data for the long
term, the service will earn much more in storage charges over the longer
life of archival data than the shorter life of near-line data.
</li>
</ul>
There may well be reasons why retrieving data from archival storage is
expensive. Most storage technologies have unified read/write heads, so
retrieval competes with ingest which, as Patiejunas figured out, is the
critical performance parameter for archival storage. This is because, to
minimize cost, archival systems are designed assuming bulk retrieval is
rare. When it happens, whether from a user request or to migrate data to
new media, it is disruptive. For example, emptying a base model TS4300
occupies it for more than a week.<br /> <br /> Six years later, things
have changed significantly. Here is the current version of the archival
services table:<br />

Points to note:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Glacier is the only one of the three that is significantly cheaper in
real terms than it was 6 years ago.
</li>
<li>
Glacier can do this because Kryder’s Law has made their storage about a
factor of about 6 cheaper in real terms in six years, or about a 35%
Kryder rate. This is somewhat faster than the rate of areal density
increase of tape, and much faster than that of disk. The guess is that
Glacier Deep Archive is on tape.
</li>
<li>
Google’s pricing indicates they aren’t serious about the archival
market.
</li>
<li>
Archive services now have differentiated tiers of service. This table
uses S3 Deep Archive, Google Archive and Microsoft Archive.
</li>
<li>
Lock-in has increased from 13.8/12.0/8.1 to 50/175/20. It is also
increased by additional charges for data lifetimes less than a
threshold, 180/365/180 days. So my cost estimate for Google is too low,
because the data would suffer these charges. But accounting for this
would skew the comparison.
</li>
<li>
Bandwidth charges are a big factor in lock-in. For Amazon they are 77%,
for Google they are 38%, for Microsoft they are 32%. Amazon’s marketing
is smart, hoping you won’t notice the outbound bandwidth charges.
</li>
</ul>
Looking at these numbers it is hard to see how anyone can justify any
archive storage other than S3 Deep Archive. It is the only one
delivering Kryder’s Law to the customer, and as my
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2017/08/economic-model-of-long-term-storage.html">economic
model</a> shows, delivering Kryder’s Law is essential to affordable
long-term storage. A petabyte for a decade costs under $120K before
taking Kryder’s Law into account and you can get it all out for under
$50K.<br />

The fundamental idea behind LOCKSS was that, given a limited budget and
a realistic range of threats, data would survive better in many cheap,
unreliable, loosely-coupled replicas than in a single expensive, durable
one.<br /> <br />
<div
style="background-color: #fff8c6; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px; padding-top: 8px; padding: 8px;">
<blockquote>
Replacing one drive takes about 15 minutes of work. If we have 30,000
drives and 2 percent fail, it takes 150 hours to replace those. In other
words, one employee for one month of 8 hour days. Getting the failure
rate down to 1 percent means you save 2 weeks of employee salary - maybe
$5,000 total? The 30,000 drives costs you $4m.<br /> <br /> The $5k/$4m
means the Hitachis are worth 1/10th of 1 per cent higher cost to us.
ACTUALLY we pay even more than that for them, but not more than a few
dollars per drive (maybe 2 or 3 percent more).<br /> <br /> Moral of the
story: design for failure and buy the cheapest components you can. :-)
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Brian Wilson, CTO of BackBlaze
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/04/evercloud-workshop.html">pointed
out</a> eleven years ago that in their long-term storage environment
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/02/17/backblaze_how_not_to_evaluate_disk_reliability/">“Double
the reliability is only worth 1/10th of 1 percent cost increase”</a>.
And thus that the moral of the story was “design for failure and buy the
cheapest components you can”.<br /> <br /> In other words, don’t put all
your eggs in one basket.<br /></p>
