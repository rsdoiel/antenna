<p>Here’s
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67dd5fa5d278819192d9fca03485723f-wordland-support">something</a>
that could be very useful. A link to ChatGPT with instructions on how to
help a user overcome problems using
<a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>. Try clicking the link
and see what happens, esp if you’re a regular WordLand user. I
discovered the feature first by asking if the bot knew what WordLand
was, and it said it did, and got it mostly right. I’ve been using
ChatGPT to develop the product, so it’s possible it has retained some of
the info. And the docs are on the web. This is one of those times when
you really want the AI bot to ingest everything they can find. What I’m
worried most about are hallucinations. But with a product like WordLand,
which could show up problems in the browser or a WordPress theme, a lot
of the help requests we get are not problems with WordLand.</p>

Notes
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Terminology: I don’t thnk we should use the term <i>social web</i> until
there actually is such a thing, so I invented a new term for these
twitter-like services.
</li>
<li>
Since Ghost is now supporting ActivityPub, I felt we needed to include
Substack because the two products compete directly.
</li>
<li>
I consider AT Proto a proprietary protocol for now, as proprietary as
Mastodon’s API.
</li>
<li>
I included WordPress because it supports ActivityPub.

If you want to comment or ask questions I posted this table on

This is
<a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3849245/github-suffers-a-cascading-supply-chain-attack-compromising-ci-cd-secrets.html">serious</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A sophisticated cascading supply chain attack has compromised multiple
GitHub Actions, exposing critical CI/CD secrets across tens of thousands
of repositories. The attack, which originally targeted the widely used
“tj-actions/changed-files” utility, is now believed to have originated
from an earlier breach of the “reviewdog/action-setup@v1” GitHub Action,
according to a report.
</p>
<p>
[…]
</p>
<p>
CISA confirmed the vulnerability has been patched in version 46.0.1.
</p>
<p>
Given that the utility is used by more than 23,000 GitHub repositories,
the scale of potential impact has raised significant alarm throughout
the developer community…

<p>date: 2025-03-20, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
If you aren’t sure how to ask for help with software, try first asking
ChatGPT or another AI chatbot to help figure out what’s going wrong. It
has infinite time to help, and won’t mind if the problem turned out to
be a random browser plug-in that was misbehaving.
</p>
<p>
It often suggests trying things you might not have thought of.
</p>
<p>
I use it myself esp as often is the case there’s no one who can or is
willing to work for me for free. I’m already playing it $20 per month,
and for that I get as much time as it takes.
</p>
<p>
Really good for organizing your approach to a problem.

<h1 id="2025-03-20-something-about-the-bot-defence-is-working">
2025-03-20 Something about the bot defence is working
</h1>
<p>
At midnight, there was a surge in activity. CPU usage went up.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-03-20-bot-defence-1.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
Load went up, too. But it stayed within reasonable bounds – less than 4
instead of the more than 80 I have seen in the past.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-03-20-bot-defence-2.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
And the number of IP addresses blocked by <code>fail2ban</code> went
from 40 to 50.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-03-20-bot-defence-3.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
I’m usually sceptical of this because the big attacks are from a far
wider variety of IP numbers. In this case, however, maybe there was some
probing that resulted in blocks? I don’t know. Lucky, I guess?
</p>
<p>
In any case, the site is still up. Yay for small wins.
</p>
<p>

<code>alex-bots</code> is a setup I desribed in
<a href="2025-02-19-bots-again">2025-02-19 Bots again, cursed</a>.
Basically a request to one of my Oddmuse wikis containing the parameter
<code>rcidonly</code> is an expensive endpoint: “all changes for this
single page” or “a feed for this single page”. This is something a human
would rarely access and yet it somehow the URLs landed in some dataset
for AI training, I suspect. So what I do is I’m redirecting any request
containing “rcidonly” in the query string to <code>/nobots</code>,
warning humans not to click on these links.
</p>
<p>
In addition to that, the filter
<code>/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/alex-bots.conf</code> contains this:
</p>
<pre><code>[Definition]
failregex = ^(www\.emacswiki\.org|communitywiki\.org|campaignwiki\.org):[0-9]+ &lt;HOST&gt; .*rcidonly=
</code></pre>
<p>
And I added a section using this filter to my jail
<code>/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/alex.conf</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>[alex-bots]
enabled = true
port    = http,https
logpath = %(apache_access_log)s
findtime = 3600
maxretry = 2
</code></pre>
<p>
So if an IP number visits three URLs containing “rcidonly” in an hour,
they get banned for ten minutes.
</p>
<p>
The <code>recidive</code> filter (a standard filter you just need to
activate) then makes sure that any IP number that got blocked three
times gets blocked for a week.

If you think these crawlers respect <code>robots.txt</code> then you are
several assumptions of good faith removed from reality. These bots crawl
everything they can find, <code>robots.txt</code> be damned, including
expensive endpoints like git blame, every page of every git log, and
every commit in every repo, and they do so using random User-Agents that
overlap with end-users and come from tens of thousands of IP addresses –
mostly residential, in unrelated subnets, each one making no more than
one HTTP request over any time period we tried to measure – actively and
maliciously adapting and blending in with end-user traffic and avoiding
attempts to characterize their behavior or block their traffic. –

another AI crawler, with IPs from an Alibaba range; this caused GitLab

that, one week ago, an Anime girl started appearing on the GNOME GitLab

<p>date: 2025-03-20, from: David Rosenthal’s blog</p>
I’ve written several times, for example in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/05/fixed-supply-variable-demand.html"><i>Fixed
Supply, Variable Demand</i></a>, about the mechanism that causes the
cost of transacting on a blockchain like Bitcoin’s to suffer massive
spikes at intervals. When no-one wants to transact, fees are low. When
everyone does, they are high. Below the fold I look in detail at a
typical Bitcoin fee spike.<br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span>

Thus the rate at which transactions are included in blocks is limited to
an average of around 7 per second. The chart shows the number of

the day of the fee spike Bitcoin processed 42% of the average of the
three days before and three days after. The variance of the transaction
rate is high. For example, on 7<sup>th</sup> September the blockchain
processed 76% more transactions than the average of the three following

Because the rate at which transactions arrive in the mempool is variable
but the rate at which they leave is capped, even transactions with miner
fees suffer a variable delay before being included in a block. Miners
choose the most profitable transactions to include. This chart shows the
median transaction wait time in minutes over the same period. Note that
on average they wait about one block time, but that on 6<sup>th</sup>
June they waited much less time.<br /> <br />

The distribution of wait times is highly skewed, with a long tail of
low-value transactions. This chart shows the average wait time for
transactions with fees, expressed as a multiple of the median wait time.
Note the ramp up in average wait time ratio, peaking the day after the
fee spike.<br /> <br /> The ratio between median and average wait times
implies that the spike in the average value of transactions on
6<sup>th</sup> June, coming on top of the ramp in transactions waiting
in the mempool from 1<sup>st</sup> June, caused a build-up of low-value
transactions, which suffered massive delays as the miners chose the
transactions with higher value and fees.<br /> <br /> In 2017’s

Transactions which fail to get the attention of miners sit in limbo
until they drop out. But the suspended state leaves payers entirely
helpless. They can’t risk resending the transaction, in case the

the reading platforms wouldn’t work with each other. So Twitter made
subscription one click. And RSS made sites include 25 buttons to give
people one-click subscription in every popular feed reader. Twitter only
needed one button. And it worked every time. Now, 18 years later, the
twitter-like systems world, Mastodon, Threads, Substack, Ghost, Bluesky,
etc mostly can’t get together on a simple way to peer. They keep talking
about it and while they do, we’re losing everything that’s important to
us. In the open tech world we have the same problem as the Democratic
Party and the same problem RSS had. We refuse to see how the world has
changed, and our slow and steady approach leads nowhere fast. We can’t
all be masters of our own silo’d domain. We need a web for words that’s
simple and can be learned in an afternoon, but doesn’t lose the
essential features writers need. I don’t know what we need to win, but I
do know what we need to get started.</p>

writer’s web. Today’s writing network is much more powerful, the
software tools are stronger, and new UI standards have evolved. Things
like Digital Ocean, Markdown, Font-Awesome and Node.js didn’t exist last
time we took a serious look at writing on the web. The web with all its
features is still here. WordPress has created a strong foundation to
build on, at least as good as the social media platforms, but better
because it’s of the web, with <i>no limits. </i>We’ve got the beginning
of a new platform, one where developers compete to create great writing
and reading environments, and we don’t need federation because the web
takes care of that.</p>

<p>The basic thing about tech is that attracts people who take things
that don’t belong to them. There’s no policing. The richest people are
the ones who are best at grabbing control of other people’s creations.
That’s the common theme. Now they’re in DC, going for all of it. The
whole thing. But they’re like the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWeh4A600E0">dog that catches

they’re taking. How could they? It’s incomprehensibly vast.</p>

2025-03-19 Grounding myself
</h1>
<p>
The powerlessness when reading the news makes me think that perhaps I
need to read even less news, shut it all out.
</p>
<p>
I also find a new appreciation for all of my ancestors who bore children
and raised them even though their world seems like a hellscape compared
to what I’m seeing.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes I wish I could just go to church and sing and pray and it
would all be good again. Except it don’t believe in it.
</p>
<p>
So all I have is plants and animals to care for. In a somewhat unhealthy
(?) relationship with life around me I find that I put plants where they
need me to water them, and find solace in the fact that they at least
are unperturbed by everything and are just happy for me to be there and
tend them. It feels a bit like an artificial dependent relationship so I
dunno, it’s weird.
</p>
<p>
When I see happy dogs and their owners I keep thinking that a dog that’s
so happy to see me, to fetch that ball, to for that walk, this happiness
is real, and they are grounded in life and the present moment.
</p>
<p>
I want back this ignorant bliss of childhood, some days.
</p>
<p>
I have no illusions. While I grew up, Iran and Iraq were at war; the
Moçambique and Angolan wars of independence turned into civil wars;
Yugoslavia fell apart in civil war. Those are the conflicts I remember,
in any case. Life and the news wasn’t great. I just didn’t know.

an idea of the structures we’re working with. It’s basically a WordPress
post with added metadata. They have these kinds of structures in RSS,
Atom, ActivityPub and AT Proto. Eventually some of these will die out,
there are too many formats to support. At any moment in time it feels
like each one is enormous and permanent. But show me where the new OS/2,
Novell, UCSD Pascal or CP/M apps are. Go back far enough, Alogol,
Smalltalk, Lisp, Simula. I am very much a less-is-more type protocol
designer, don’t try to plan for things you don’t have a working model
of, because the ideas you gain when you actually put the app together
will work much better. And only add things you’re willing to live with
forever. Slow down to hurry up. Etc. Anyway,

<h2 id="enshittification-as-a-matter-of-taste">Enshittification as a
matter of taste</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-19, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
“Enshittification” is a termed coined by Cory Doctorow in 2023 to
describe a pattern of decreasing quality observed in online services and
products. Since Doctorow’s post, there’s been no shortage of think
pieces on enshittification and its role in our society and to a large
extent I agree with them all. I think it’s an inevitable problem that
shows the splitting seams of Capitalism. If you will allow, I’d like to
add a tangential thought – one slight embellishment – to this topic.
</p>
<p>
To me, enshittification means that a person who lacks taste was put in a
position of power.
</p>
<p>
Everyone knows ads on the internet suck. But ads also pay bills and help
keep the lights on in newsrooms. When a website adds one
(privacy-preserving) ad to a website, I say “Okay”. Two, I permit it.
Three, I say “Easy now” but still scroll through unencumbered. But when
the website adds a fifth, seventh, twelfth ad… I know a person who lacks
taste is at the wheel. I can feel it in my bones when an app or website
has prioritized revenue over user experience. A person without taste or
high emotional intelligence broke the unspoken contract we had built on
mutual respect.

When you read about the development of the iPhone in books like Ken
Kocienda’s <em>Creative Selection</em> or Tony Fadell’s <em>Build</em>,
you understand Steve Jobs’ superpower wasn’t so much that he possessed a
reality distortion field, but that he was a great editor. He could find
the good ideas in a pile of prototypes and say “no” (harshly, I’ve read)
to the less-than-great ideas. You need a person with taste in the
decision making process.
<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino">When
we see giants falter</a>, it’s a lack of taste shining through.
</p>
<p>
Going forward, I think taste and style are more valuable than ever
before. In an era where we’re able to rapidly generate cheap low quality
content or software at a scale we’ve never seen before,
<a href="https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/elizabeth-goodspeed-column-taste-technology-art-280224">we
will need people with taste in the mix</a>. We’ll need aggregators to
dive in the dumpsters for the treasure. We’ll need people who know how
to zig when everyone is using the Zag-o-tron 9000. We’ll need people who
can offer critique and say “no” when the
“<a href="https://derekkedziora.com/notes/2024-12-11-an-llms-not-going-to-tell-you-no">yes
yes always more</a>” machine barrels through town and begins knocking
down institutions.

a big car, but it drives in many ways like the

<h1 id="2025-03-15-new-window-manager-niri">
2025-03-15 New window manager: niri
</h1>
<p>
I’m giving <a href="https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri">niri</a> a go. The
idea is that a scrollable tiling window manager (“Wayland compositor”)
is a better fit than just a tiling window manager. For tiling window
managers, I just create new stuff and have it maximized. I really can’t
do the quick splitting and rearranging that it seems to afford. The
result is that I start moving stuff to other workspaces, where they’re
invisible and gone. I’m hoping that new windows popping up next to
existing windows makes it feel like a stack.
</p>
<p>
Having gone through the config file and having made a few small changes
it already feels pretty nice. Right now one of the problems I have is
that by sheer bad luck I decided to rotate my external monitor by 90°
and that doesn’t work quite as well, maybe? I’m not sure. One of the
first changes I did was change the default widths from ⅓ / ½ / ⅔ to 0.95
/ ⅔ / ½ with 0.95 being the default.

<p>
I didn’t find a solution for Gimp. And I already had no solution for
VASSAL under Sway. So for these applications, I still have Gnome
installed.
</p>
<p>
Currently my <code>~/.config/fish/conf.d/window-manager.fish</code>
says:
</p>
<pre><code># If running from tty1 start sway
set TTY (tty)
[ &quot;$TTY&quot; = &quot;/dev/tty1&quot; ] &amp;&amp; exec sway
[ &quot;$TTY&quot; = &quot;/dev/tty2&quot; ] &amp;&amp; exec startx
[ &quot;$TTY&quot; = &quot;/dev/tty3&quot; ] &amp;&amp; exec niri
</code></pre>
<p>
Oh well. 😅
</p>
<p>
<strong>2025-03-19</strong>. I’m finding that there were too many
problems with apps that didn’t work or had very slow startup times. So
I’m back to <a href="2023-10-22-sway">using Sway</a>.

<p>date: 2025-03-18, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
This is like that moment, five years ago, when we realized that Covid
was going to kill a lot of us but it hadn’t happened yet. A lot of
people weren’t yet aware. My
<a href="http://scripting.com/images/2024/10/02/palfrey2003.jpeg">friend</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Palfrey">John Palfrey</a>,
who is a legal scholar, has been writing about this moment on LinkedIn
and Facebook. Things are flashing by very quickly, so I’m going to
publish his latest piece here, below, so it gets a chance to get to the
places I’m hooked into.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Lawyer friends and non-lawyer friends: has it become hard to say out
loud in public: “we believe in the rule of law in America”? That seems
not remotely controversial as a concept. The relative quiet on this
topic is what is striking me most at the moment.
</li>
<li>
It would be a good idea for our Republic to avoid sleepwalking through a
Constitutional crisis. Of course there are extremely talented lawyers
working overtime on many fronts. Those who are not directly involved in
litigation have other tools, including voice and funding and organizing,
to make plain the simple truth that we should not let the rule of law
slip away in America bit by bit. That will continue to happen if the
rulings of federal judges can simply be ignored or sidestepped with
impunity.
</li>
<li>
If the legislature has abdicated its role in checking the power of the
executive, and then the judicial branch is also out, well, that leaves
just one. This is not “fancy law stuff”. This is “4th grade civics
stuff” – separation of powers, checks and balances (I know, I know, we
don’t teach civics enough in America…).
</li>
<li>
It is actually <em>not</em> more complicated than that. It can’t be that
hard to say out loud: “we value the rule of law in America” – no matter
your politics or party.
</li>
</ul>

domination of “electric vehicles” is going to become a nightmare, not

of computing’s conquest of the automotive industry. Industry …</p>

Security Human Factors Research Skewed Towards Western Ideas and

Really interesting research:
“<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24/presentation/hasegawa">How
WEIRD is Usable Privacy and Security Research?</a>” by Ayako A. Hasegawa
Daisuke Inoue, and Mitsuaki Akiyama:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Abstract</b>: In human factor fields such as human-computer
interaction (HCI) and psychology, researchers have been concerned that
participants mostly come from WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized,
Rich, and Democratic) countries. This WEIRD skew may hinder
understanding of diverse populations and their cultural differences. The
usable privacy and security (UPS) field has inherited many research
methodologies from research on human factor fields. We conducted a
literature review to understand the extent to which participant samples
in UPS papers were from WEIRD countries and the characteristics of the
methodologies and research topics in each user study recruiting Western
or non-Western participants. We found that the skew toward WEIRD
countries in UPS is greater than that in HCI. Geographic and linguistic
barriers in the study methods and recruitment methods may cause
researchers to conduct user studies locally. In addition, many papers
did not report participant demographics, which could hinder the
replication of the reported studies, leading to low reproducibility. To
improve geographic diversity, we provide the suggestions including
facilitate replication studies, address geographic and linguistic issues
of study/recruitment methods, and facilitate research on the topics for
non-WEIRD populations…

About a month ago,
<a href="https://www.jayeless.net/2025/02/indies-first-library-trip.html" title="Blog post from 15 Feb: Indie&#39;s First Library Trip">I
mentioned</a> that we’d borrowed a book from this “Big Ideas for Little
Philosophers” series called <cite>Love with Plato</cite>. Even though I
made fun of it at the time, it actually struck me as a really nice
little book, and since I was curious about what they would say about the
other philosophers, I shelled out to order the whole series:

<p>
I’m pleased to be able to offer a <em>positive</em> baby book review.
While I don’t think the books in this series have all accurately
outlined the core theses of their respective philosophers, they
<em>are</em> all really good, thoughtful books that invite kids to
grapple with questions about how we can be good and happy people.
</p>
<p>
I mentioned last time that I wished the library had had <cite>Equality
with Simone de Beauvoir</cite>, and that <em>is</em> one of my
favourites, now that I’ve read it. It explains, in very “small
child”-friendly language, that gender stereotypes are completely
artificial, that girls and boys are really much the same (we all cry
when we’re sad, and smile when we’re happy…), and that everyone is
happier when we can be our true selves without judgement. On one page
there is also a cute cat rockin’ out with a walkman and a hula hoop in
the corner, so the book gets bonus points for that.
</p>
<p>
But then the one that really surprised me was <cite>Happiness with
Aristotle</cite>, which actually got into a deep rumination on
friendship and what it means to be a “true friend” that I think many
adults would benefit from reading. It talks about how some friends make
you laugh and feel good to spend time with, and other friends will help
you out when you need a hand, but a <em>true</em> friend is actually
someone who’ll call you out on your shit, so you can grow as a person.
(Again, in kid-friendly language.) Not only that, but the book added
that before you can be a “true friend” to others, you need to be a “true
friend” to yourself, which means “loving yourself as much as you love
your friends”. Like… damn! Where was this book when I was 18–19 and
stuck in “I can fix him!” thinking? It’s so good! Again, I’m not sure
it’s an accurate description of the very core of Aristotelian
philosophy, but it’s a great message.
</p>
<p>
The books are board books (you know, the hard cardboard ones usually
intended for real babies), but they’re full of open-ended questions to
elicit discussion with a small child. I would love to read these with
Indie when she’s, like, five and actually able to engage with the ideas
therein. I’m glad to have bought our own copies, because I think we’ll
get a lot of mileage out of them.
</p>
<p>
Having said this, the series <strong>is</strong> clearly missing a book
about one very important philosopher, one they could call something like
<cite>Communism with Marx</cite>. I guess we just can’t have it all 😔

there’s any substance to the accusation. No indictment, trial, verdict,

New paper:
“<a href="https://tosc.iacr.org/index.php/ToSC/article/view/12078/11919">GPU
Assisted Brute Force Cryptanalysis of GPRS, GSM, RFID, and TETRA: Brute
Force Cryptanalysis of KASUMI, SPECK, and TEA3</a>.”
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b> Key lengths in symmetric cryptography are determined
with respect to the brute force attacks with current technology. While
nowadays at least 128-bit keys are recommended, there are many standards
and real-world applications that use shorter keys. In order to estimate
the actual threat imposed by using those short keys, precise estimates
for attacks are crucial.
</p>
<p>
In this work we provide optimized implementations of several widely used
algorithms on GPUs, leading to interesting insights on the cost of brute
force attacks on several real-word applications…

<h2 id="blogging-is-due-for-a-refresh">Blogging is due for a
refresh</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-16, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
A lot has changed since the last time we took a serious look at
blogging. A few items, as examples.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
When RSS came along Markdown didn’t exist. The two technologies belong
together, imho.
</li>
<li>
Websockets have replaced long polling.
</li>
<li>
Servers got cheap! (and easy to deploy).
</li>
<li>
SQL is fast and the tools are much better.
</li>
<li>
The user interfaces of all the Web 2.0+ products didn’t exist last time
we created new blogging communities. We can borrow ideas from
twitter-like systems, even huge products like Facebook and Spotify have
innovations that come long after the initial wave of blogging.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
But one thing stays the same – all the components are replaceable.
Absolutely zero lock-in. We use simple standard APIs where they exist,
and create new minimal formats and protocols where they don’t.
</p>
<p>
Blogging has a simple philosophy that remains constant.
