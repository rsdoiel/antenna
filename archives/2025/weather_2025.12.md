Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0752 AM CDT Wed Mar 26 2025

Valid 261300Z - 271200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS WESTERN
PORTIONS OF WASHINGTON/OREGON...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected across parts of the Pacific
Northwest this afternoon and evening, with supercells possible west
of the Cascades across Oregon into Washington. These storms may
produce large hail, perhaps a tornado or two, and strong wind gusts.

...Pacific Northwest...
A very active early season severe risk is expected regionally today.
A seasonally strong upper low over the coastal Pacific Northwest
will shift eastward today, highlighted by a 100+ kt mid-level speed
max that will overspread coastal areas by evening. Strong height
falls will similarly spread across this region and the associated
synoptic cold front should arc from off the Washington Coast to
southward along the Oregon Coast by evening.

Low-level mean-mixing ratios are notably high, as compared to
typical daily climatological values (highest 5-10%), this morning
based on 12z observed soundings from Salem and Medford, Oregon.
Large-scale forcing for ascent will contribute to a further
moistening of profiles and PW values may approach 1 inch prior to
convective initiation. Cold mid-level temperatures and a plume of
steepening mid-level lapse rates will also notably overspread the
region. Of particular concern are the cold mid-level temperatures,
and the steep lapse rate plume that will overspread this region.
Forecast soundings suggest convective temperatures should be
breached by 21-22z west of the Cascades, and surface-based CAPE
should reach/exceed 1000 J/kg coincident with a favorably sheared
environment for organized, rotating updrafts.

Isolated to scattered robust convection seems likely to develop by
21-22z across western Oregon, immediately ahead of the strong
forcing. This activity should grow upscale and develop
north-northeastward ahead of the approaching speed max, with
profiles favoring supercell development. Hail should be common with
this activity and the strongest updrafts may generate quite large
hailstones, possibly exceeding golf ball size, or even larger with a
few of the most intense storms. Some tornado risk will also exist,
particularly where low-level winds maintain at least a modest
easterly component. Damaging winds may also occur.

...Texas Lower Rio Grande River Valley...
Water vapor imagery depicts a substantial sub-tropical cirrus plume
from the southern Baja Peninsula, across Mexico toward the lower Rio
Grande Valley. A weak disturbance will approach the international
border through mid day, and this will draw a substantial moisture
plume across South Texas. Forecast soundings exhibit modest lapse
rates despite the moistening profiles. While forecast shear is not
particularly strong, especially with northward extent, some
organization is possible and this activity could generate gusty
winds and/or hail. Otherwise, a considerable amount of convection is
expected across this region which may tend to disrupt and limit
organizational potential.

## SPC Mar 26, 2025 Day 4-8 Severe Weather Outlook

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0404 AM CDT Wed Mar 26 2025

Valid 291200Z - 031200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Medium-range models appear to be in reasonable agreement through Day
6 (Monday March 31), with respect to synoptic-scale features. 
Divergence in solutions increases thereafter, particularly with the
strength/progression of the next trough moving across the western
CONUS and into the Plains.  As such, no risk areas will be
considered beyond Day 6/Monday.

Day 4/Saturday, a couple of small-scale vorticity maxima/short-wave
troughs are forecast to cross the central portion of the country,
ahead of the stronger system advancing across the West.  This
feature is forecast to reach the High Plains overnight, as a surface
low moves across the Kansas/Oklahoma vicinity.  Models continue to
indicate that capping will remain an issue, hindering convective
development in the warm sector ahead of the low (across the
Kansas/Oklahoma/western Missouri/western Arkansas area) at least
until after dark/overnight.  While some severe threat may evolve
with storms which should be slightly elevated for the most part,
risk does not appear sufficient to warrant inclusion of a 15% risk
area.

Day 5/Sunday, more substantial cyclogenesis is expected, though
differences exist between the models in terms of timing/location of
the developing low -- and associated cold front.  Nonetheless,
substantial warm-sector destabilization is forecast to occur from
Missouri/Arkansas/eastern Texas eastward across the Mississippi
Valley during the day, and extending eastward across the
Midwest/Ohio and Tennessee Valleys.  This will support scattered
thunderstorm development, within an increasingly sheared
environment.  By early afternoon, severe/supercell storms are
expected, accompanied by the risk for very large hail, damaging
winds, and a few tornadoes.  Storms should spread southeast of the
Ohio and Mississippi Valleys overnight, accompanied by ongoing
severe risk.

Day 6/Monday, risk will likely have shifted to near and east of the
Appalachians, and southward to the Gulf Coast area, as the surface
cold front advances.  Destabilization ahead of the front will
support continuation of severe risk given favorably strong flow
aloft, with storms reaching/moving off the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts
late in the period.

## SPC Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0215 AM CDT Tue Mar 25 2025

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...Synopsis...
Large-scale ridging will continue to amplify over the western US as
a subtle southern stream shortwave trough slides underneath the
ridge. Weak ascent will overspread parts of the Southwest as modest
moisture returns to the west. This may support isolated dry
thunderstorms atop dry fuels in parts of the Southwest.

...Parts of NM...
As the weak upper-level trough moves over the Southwest, modest
ascent and easterly upslope flow is expected to promote isolated to
widely scattered showers and thunderstorms from central NM to
western TX. At the western extent of the moist plume, PWAT values
less than 0.75 inches will overlap with sufficiently steep low and
mid-level lapse rates to support high-based storms with poor
precipitation efficiency. Dry lightning strikes appear likely over
very receptive fuels given the high-based nature of any convection
that forms. An Isolated Dry Thunder area has been added across
western and central NM where best overlap of thunderstorm potential
and dry fuels should exist for several hours Wed.

...Appalachians...
Another day of dry conditions is expected across the southern
Appalachians Wed. High pressure will gradually shift eastward with
downslope flow likely across parts of western VA and the Carolinas.
While surface winds may not be overly strong (generally less than 15
mph), isolated gusts near 20 mph are possible. In addition,
afternoon RH should fall below 25%. Model guidance shows
considerable spread regarding the spatial and temporal coverage of
any elevated fire weather conditions that may develop. A few hours
of locally elevated fire-weather conditions are possible, but
uncertain.

Mesoscale Discussion 0260
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0756 AM CDT Mon Mar 24 2025

Areas affected...southeastern Louisiana

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 64...

Valid 241256Z - 241430Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 64
continues.

SUMMARY...A damaging wind threat will continue through the morning
across southeast Louisiana.

DISCUSSION...A line of storms continues to move east across
southeast Louisiana this morning with a recent 68 knot wind gust at
KBTR at 1228 UTC near the apex of this bow. The 12Z LIX RAOB showed
around 1250 J/kg MLCAPE with a weak near-surface stable layer and 48
knots of 0-6 km shear. Extensive cloudcover should limit much
heating this morning, but continued low-level moistening ahead of
the squall line should maintain some surface based instability and a
damaging wind threat through the morning. The northern extent of
this severe weather threat is likely delineated by a southward
moving line of storms/outflow boundary (currently near the MS/LA
border). An additional watch is not currently anticipated east of
watch 64 as any residual surface based instability will likely be
limited to the immediate coastline by later this morning.
