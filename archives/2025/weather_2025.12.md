Mesoscale Discussion 0260
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0756 AM CDT Mon Mar 24 2025

Areas affected...southeastern Louisiana

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 64...

Valid 241256Z - 241430Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 64
continues.

SUMMARY...A damaging wind threat will continue through the morning
across southeast Louisiana.

DISCUSSION...A line of storms continues to move east across
southeast Louisiana this morning with a recent 68 knot wind gust at
KBTR at 1228 UTC near the apex of this bow. The 12Z LIX RAOB showed
around 1250 J/kg MLCAPE with a weak near-surface stable layer and 48
knots of 0-6 km shear. Extensive cloudcover should limit much
heating this morning, but continued low-level moistening ahead of
the squall line should maintain some surface based instability and a
damaging wind threat through the morning. The northern extent of
this severe weather threat is likely delineated by a southward
moving line of storms/outflow boundary (currently near the MS/LA
border). An additional watch is not currently anticipated east of
watch 64 as any residual surface based instability will likely be
limited to the immediate coastline by later this morning.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0754 AM CDT Mon Mar 24 2025

Valid 241300Z - 251200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE MIDDLE
GULF COAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are possible today from southern Louisiana
eastward to the Florida Panhandle and far southern Georgia.

...Gulf Coast from southeast Louisiana to Florida Panhandle...
A relatively fast-moving (45-50 kt) bowing complex continues
east-northeastward early this morning across south-central/southeast
Louisiana toward the far southern Mississippi border vicinity.
Strong rear-inflow/MCV characteristics are readily apparent in
observational data including regional WSR-88D VWP winds. A 68kt/78
mph wind gust was recently measured at Baton Rouge, LA near/north of
the apex of the bowing complex.

This cluster of storms should continue to produce potentially severe
wind gusts this morning, although its northern extent may
increasingly be hostilely influenced by southward-sagging convective
outflow/effective front that precedes it. Regardless, some
severe-wind potential may persist into the afternoon, particularly
in areas that are within roughly 50-80 miles of the Gulf coast.

...South-central Texas...
As the cold front stalls and begins to gradually return northward
later today, strong diurnal heating and deep surface moisture could
support very isolated storm development across the higher terrain of
the Edward Plateau and south-central Texas. Area RAP soundings show
steep mid-level lapse rates (~8 C/km) and 2000-2500 J/kg of MLCAPE,
which could support a conditional severe risk for hail and damaging
gusts if storms were to develop. However, this currently appears
unlikely given subtle mid-level height rises and limited ascent away
from the slow-moving front. As such, probabilities will continue to
be withheld given the relatively low/conditional nature of the risk.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 64
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
625 AM CDT Mon Mar 24 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Southern Louisiana
  Far Southeast Mississippi
  Coastal Waters

* Effective this Monday morning from 625 AM until 1100 AM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging winds likely with isolated significant gusts
    to 75 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...A well-organized bowing line of storms will continue
steadily east-northeastward this morning with wind damage as the
primary hazard.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 50
statute miles north and south of a line from 65 miles northwest of
Houma LA to 35 miles east southeast of Slidell LA. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU4).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
1 inch. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 65 knots. A few
cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
25045.

## SPC Mar 24, 2025 Day 4-8 Severe Weather Outlook

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0402 AM CDT Mon Mar 24 2025

Valid 271200Z - 011200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Medium-range/global models have come into reasonable agreement with
respect to the most recent run, signaling toward heightened severe
risk over the upcoming weekend across central portions of the
country.

Days 4-5 (Thursday/Friday), locally strong storms will be possible
across a rather broad portion of the central of the country, from
the Upper Midwest to the southern Plains Day 4/Thursday, and the
Plains into the Ohio Valley Friday.  This will occur as a
weak/slow-moving southern stream trough moves slowly
east-northeastward across this region.  Somewhat limit risk, over a
broad geographic area, precludes introduction of any 15% risk areas
either of these two days.

Meanwhile, the primary synoptic pattern -- even early in the period
-- favors a persistent lee surface low/trough over the High Plains. 
This will allow southerly low-level flow to evolve/expand across
almost all of the central and eastern portions of the country as a
warm front shifts northward into the northern CONUS.

By early Saturday/Day 6, height falls associated with a
strengthening trough moving across the Intermountain West should
begin to spread into the Plains, with the trough itself currently
expected to reach the High Plains.  This will result in an eastward
advance of a surface low front out of the High Plains and across the
central Plains states through the evening/overnight.  With a
moistening pre-frontal boundary layer ahead of the advancing system,
and increasing flow aloft, the overall setup will favor increasing
severe potential, with all-hazards possible.

Day 7/Sunday, eastward advance of the synoptic-scale features will
continue, along with some continued strengthening.  With continued
moistening of the pre-frontal warm sector supporting afternoon
destabilization, along with increasing deep-layer flow, a broad area
of severe risk seems likely to evolve -- centered over the Mid and
Lower Mississippi/Lower Ohio/Tennessee Valleys.  Again -- all severe
weather hazards would be possible.

Monday, the primary focus for convective potential will shift east
of the Appalachians.  Here, weaker low-level moisture (and thus less
robust destabilization potential) is expected at this time. 
Therefore, while severe risk may evolve, thermodynamic uncertainty
precludes initiation of a risk area for Day 8/Monday.
