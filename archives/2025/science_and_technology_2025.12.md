## NASA’s Webb Captures Neptune’s Auroras For First Time

## How NixOS and reproducible builds could have detected the xz backdoor for the benefit of all

date: 2025-03-25, from: OS News

Some more light reading: While it was already established that the open source supply chain was often the target of malicious actors, what is stunning is the amount of energy invested by Jia Tan to gain the trust of the maintainer of the xz project, acquire push access to the repository and then among other perfectly legitimate contributions insert – piece by piece – the code for a very sophisticated and obfuscated backdoor. This should be a wake up call for the OSS community. We should consider the open source supply chain a high value target for powerful threat actors, and to collectively find countermeasures against such attacks. In this article, I’ll discuss the inner workings of the xz backdoor and how I think we could have mechanically detected it thanks to build reproducibility. ↫ Julien Malka It&#8217;s a very detailed look at the situation and what Nix could to prevent it in the future.

## Playing multimedia with Dillo

date: 2025-03-24, from: OS News

What if you want to use a web browser like Dillo, which lacks JavaScript support and can&#8217;t play audio or video inside the browser? Dillo doesn&#8217;t have the capability to play audio or video directly from the browser, however it can easily offload this task to other programs. This page collects some examples of how to do watch videos and listen to audio tracks or podcasts by using an external player program. In particular we will cover mpv with yt-dlp which supports YouTube and Bandcamp among many other sites. ↫ Dillo website The way Dillo handles this feels very UNIX-y, in that it will call an external program &#8211; mpv and yt-dlp, for instance &#8211; to play a YouTube from an &#8220;Open in mpv&#8221; option in the right-click menu for a link. It&#8217;s nothing earth-shattering or revolutionary, of course, but I very much appreciate that Dillo bakes this functionality right in, allowing you to define any such actions and add them to the context menu.

This whitepaper provides an introduction to and overview of seL4. We explain what seL4 is (and is not) and explore its defining features. We explain what makes seL4 uniquely qualified as the operating-system kernel of choice for security- and safety-critical systems, and generally embedded and cyber-physical systems. In particular, we explain seL4’s assurance story, its security- and safety-relevant features, and its benchmark-setting performance. We also discuss typical usage scenarios, including incremental cyber retrofit of legacy systems. ↫ Gernot Heiser Some light reading for Monday.
