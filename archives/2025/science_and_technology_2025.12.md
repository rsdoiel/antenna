## US government’s attack on free speech, science, and research is causing a brain drain

date: 2025-03-26, from: OS News

How do you create a brain drain and lose your status as eminent destination for scientists and researchers? The United States seems to be sending out questionnaires to researchers at universities and research institutes outside of the United States, asking them about their political leanings. Dutch universities are strongly advising Dutch researches not to respond to the questionnaires, and warn that they are designed to stifle free speech and independent research through intimidation. Universities of the Netherlands (UNL) has also warned researchers about the questionnaire. The USGS questionnaire asks, for example, whether the researcher’s organisation works with ‘entities associated with communist, socialist, or totalitarian parties’, whether the research project has taken ‘appropriate measures’ to ‘defend against gender ideology’ and whether the project has ‘measurable benefits for US domestic industries, workforce, or economic sectors’. ↫ Universiteit Leiden Researchers trying to enter the United States are also facing intimidation tactics, with the United States government going so far as to refuse entry to scientists critical of the Trump regime: A French scientist was denied entry to the US this month after immigration officers at an airport searched his phone and found messages in which he had expressed criticism of the Trump administration, said a French minister. “I learned with concern that a French researcher who was traveling to a conference near Houston was denied entry to the United States before being expelled,” Philippe Baptiste, France’s minister of higher education and research, said in a statement on Monday to Agence France-Presse published by Le Monde. ↫ Robert Mackey at the Guardian Being denied entry is one thing &#8211; being arrested and sent to a string of prisons is another, like this Canadian woman: Our next stop was Arizona, the San Luis Regional Detention Center. The transfer process lasted 24 hours, a sleepless, grueling ordeal. This time, men were transported with us. Roughly 50 of us were crammed into a prison bus for the next five hours, packed together – women in the front, men in the back. We were bound in chains that wrapped tightly around our waists, with our cuffed hands secured to our bodies and shackles restraining our feet, forcing every movement into a slow, clinking struggle. ↫ Jasmine Mooney at the Guardian If you&#8217;re a scientist or researcher planning on going to a conference in the US (or, say, a developer wanting to go to a tech conference), you should reconsider. Even if your papers are in order, you could end up on a plane to a concentration camp in El Salvador before you can even call a lawyer &#8211; while being told that any judge standing up for your rights should be impeached. The United States&#8217; war on free speech, science, and research goes far beyond intimidating individual scientists and researchers. The Trump regime is actively erasing and deleting entire fields of science, most notably anything involving things like climate and gender, and openly attacking and cutting funding to universities that disagree with the Trump regime. Almost immediately after being sworn in as president on 20 January, Trump put his signature to piles of executive orders cancelling or freezing tens of billions of dollars in funding for research and international assistance, and putting the seal on thousands of lay-offs. Orwellian restrictions have been placed on research, including bans on studies that mention particular words relating to sex and gender, race, disability and other protected characteristics. ↫ Nature US President Donald Trump’s latest war on the climate includes withdrawing support for any research that mentions the word. He has also launched a purge on government websites hosting climate data, in an apparent attempt to make the evidence disappear. ↫ Corey J. A. Bradshaw at The Conversation The Trump administration has fired hundreds of workers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), the US’s pre-eminent climate research agency housed within the Department of Commerce, the Guardian has learned.  “There is no plan or thought into how to continue to deliver science or service on weather, severe storms and events, conservation and management of our coasts and ocean life and much more,” he said. “Let’s not pretend this is about efficiency, quality of work or cost savings because none of those false justifications are remotely true.” ↫ Dharna Noor and Gabrielle Canon at the Guardian Intimidating current scientists isn&#8217;t enough, either &#8211; the scientists of the future must also suffer: US President Donald Trump has signed an executive orderto dismantle the Department of Education, fulfilling a campaign pledge and a long-cherished goal of some conservatives.  In its statement, the American Federation of Teachers said: &#8220;No-one likes bureaucracy, and everyone&#8217;s in favour of more efficiency, so let&#8217;s find ways to accomplish that. &#8220;But don&#8217;t use a &#8216;war on woke&#8217; to attack the children living in poverty and the children with disabilities.&#8221; ↫ Ana Faguy at the BBC But what about intimidating university students who don&#8217;t fall in line with the regime? Well, we can&#8217;t forget about those, now, can we? After immigration agents detained Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil over his involvement in pro-Palestine protests on campus, President Donald Trump promised it was just the beginning. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has since arrested at least two more students who are in the country on visas — one of whom had recently sued the Trump administration on First Amendment grounds. ↫ Gaby Del Valle at The Verge A Cornell University PhD student earlier this month sued the Trump administration seeking to stop the president’s order aimed at foreign students accused of “antisemitism”. Days later, lawyers at the justice department emailed to request that the student “surrender” to immigration officials ↫ Maanvi Singh at the Guardian These are just a small selection of stories, and I could&#8217;ve picked a dozen more still if I wanted to. The point should be squarely (roundly?) driven home by now: the United States government seems to be doing everything in its power to scare off the very people an economy based on science,

## KDE developers show off SDDM replacement

date: 2025-03-26, from: OS News

KDE&#8217;s login manager, SDDM, has its share of problems, and as such, a number of KDE developers are working on replacement to fix many of these long-standing issues. So, what exactly is wrong with SDDM as it exists today? With SDDM, power management is reinvented from scratch with bespoke configuration. We can&#8217;t integrate with Plasma&#8217;s network management, power management, volume controls, or brightness controls without reinventing them in the desktop-agnostic backend. SDDM was already having to duplicate too much functionality we have in KDE, which was very frustrating when we&#8217;re left maintaining it. ↫ David Edmundson On top of that, theming is also a big issue with SDDM, as it doesn&#8217;t adopt any of the existing Plasma themes, wallpapers, and so on, forcing users to manually makes thse changes for SDDM, and forcing theme developers to make custom themes just for SDDM instead of it just adopting Plasma&#8217;s settings. The new login manager they&#8217;re working on will instead make use of existing Plasma components and be brought up like Plasma itself, too. For now, the SDDM replacement is roughly at feature parity with SDDM, but it&#8217;s by no means ready for widespread adoption by distributions or users. Developers interested in trying it out can do so, though, and as it mostly looks like the existing default SDDM setup, you won&#8217;t even notice anything in day-to-day use.

## Google moves all Android development behind closed doors

date: 2025-03-26, from: OS News

Up until now, Google developed several components of Android out in the open, as part of AOSP, while developing everything else behind closed doors, only releasing the source code once the final new Android version was released. This meant that Google had to merge the two branches, which lead to problems and issues, so Google decided it&#8217;s now moving all development of Android behind closed doors. What will change is the frequency of public source code releases for specific Android components. Some components like the build system, update engine, Bluetooth stack, Virtualization framework, and SELinux configuration are currently AOSP-first, meaning they’re developed fully in public. Most Android components like the core OS framework are primarily developed internally, although some features, such as the unlocked-only storage area API, are still developed within AOSP. Beginning next week, all Android development will occur within Google’s internal branches, and the source code for changes will only be released when Google publishes a new branch containing those changes. As this is already the practice for most Android component changes, Google is simply consolidating its development efforts into a single branch. ↫ Mishaal Rahman at Android Authority This brings up a very old debate: if development happens entirely behind closed doors, with only the occasional code drop, is the software in question really open source? Technically, the answer is obviously &#8216;yes&#8217; &#8211; there&#8217;s no requirement that development take place in public. However, I&#8217;m fairly sure that when most people think of open source, they think not only of occasionally throwing chunks of code over the proverbial corporate walls, but also of open development, where everybody is free to contribute, pipe in, and follow along. Clearly, this move makes Android more closed, not less so, and it follows in a long string of changes Google has made to Android that make it ever harder to consider AOSP, the Android Open Source Project, a capable, modern mobile operating system. The Android fork of the Linux kernel will always be properly open, of course, but I have my doubts Android in and of itself will remain open source in the narrow definition for much longer, and even if it does, you have to wonder how much value it will have. I mean, Darwin, the open source base underneath macOS and iOS, is technically open source, but nobody cares because Apple made it pretty much worthless in and of itself. Anything of value is stripped out and not only developed behind closed doors, but also not released as open source, ensuring Darwin is nothing but a curiosity we sometimes remember exists. Android could be heading in the same direction. My biggest worry are Android ROMs, most notably for me personally GrapheneOS. I honestly have no idea how this will impact such projects.

Long-sought auroral glow finally emerges under Webb’s powerful gaze For the first time, NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has captured bright auroral activity on Neptune.

## How NixOS and reproducible builds could have detected the xz backdoor for the benefit of all

date: 2025-03-25, from: OS News

Some more light reading: While it was already established that the open source supply chain was often the target of malicious actors, what is stunning is the amount of energy invested by Jia Tan to gain the trust of the maintainer of the xz project, acquire push access to the repository and then among other perfectly legitimate contributions insert – piece by piece – the code for a very sophisticated and obfuscated backdoor. This should be a wake up call for the OSS community. We should consider the open source supply chain a high value target for powerful threat actors, and to collectively find countermeasures against such attacks. In this article, I’ll discuss the inner workings of the xz backdoor and how I think we could have mechanically detected it thanks to build reproducibility. ↫ Julien Malka It&#8217;s a very detailed look at the situation and what Nix could to prevent it in the future.

## Playing multimedia with Dillo

date: 2025-03-24, from: OS News

What if you want to use a web browser like Dillo, which lacks JavaScript support and can&#8217;t play audio or video inside the browser? Dillo doesn&#8217;t have the capability to play audio or video directly from the browser, however it can easily offload this task to other programs. This page collects some examples of how to do watch videos and listen to audio tracks or podcasts by using an external player program. In particular we will cover mpv with yt-dlp which supports YouTube and Bandcamp among many other sites. ↫ Dillo website The way Dillo handles this feels very UNIX-y, in that it will call an external program &#8211; mpv and yt-dlp, for instance &#8211; to play a YouTube from an &#8220;Open in mpv&#8221; option in the right-click menu for a link. It&#8217;s nothing earth-shattering or revolutionary, of course, but I very much appreciate that Dillo bakes this functionality right in, allowing you to define any such actions and add them to the context menu.
