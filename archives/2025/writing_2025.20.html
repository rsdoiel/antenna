Sometimes we lose our passion — the fire burning inside that pushes us
through adverse and difficult times during our screenwriting
journeys. <br><br>It doesn’t matter if you’re a beginner learning the
ins and outs of writing a screenplay, an experienced screenwriter with
some major contest and fellowship wins, or a seasoned pro earning money
and seeing your name on the screen. Sometimes the passion dims, the
words don’t come, the cursor blinks back at you in quiet judgement on an
empty page, and you begin to question if you’ve lost <em>it</em> for
good — or, if you ever really had <em>it</em> at all.    <br><br>Don’t
worry. Breathe. <span style="font-weight: bold;">You haven’t lost your
fire</span>. It’s still there. <br><br>The key to any successful run at
a career in screenwriting is to learn how to get the fire back — how to
reignite those creative and inspirational flames to a point where the
ideas, visuals, words, and story/character solutions come flowing out of
you through your fingers, onto those keys, and onto the
pages. <br><br>Here are some tested, implemented, and proven ways to
reignite your screenwriting fire!
