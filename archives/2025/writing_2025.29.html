“Write your own anxieties. Get into your own psyche. I think if it
scares you – like, I’m terrified of guns, and that’s where <em>The
Purge</em> came from. But here, there were various generational fears
and whatnot that led to <em>The Home</em>, Adam’s fears and my fears
about getting older and our anxiety. So I would say if it’s born from
your fear, the majority of the audience probably has a similar fear. I
think we are communal in that way. Fears are not singular, so I think
you should work off your own fears, and on a practical level, if you can
keep the budget small, you’re in a much better place getting it made.
That was key to <em>The Purge</em> getting made, that it was one
location,” says James DeMonaco, director and co-writer of the new horror
film, <em>The Home</em>.<br><br>On today’s show, we talk with both James
DeMonaco and Adam Cantor, co-writers of the new horror film <em>The
Home</em>.<br><br><em>The Home</em> is about Max (Pete Davidson), a
troubled young man, who starts working at a retirement home only to
realize its residents and caretakers harbor sinister secrets. As he
investigates the building and its forbidden fourth floor, he starts to
uncover connections to his own past and upbringing as a foster
child. <br><br>DeMonaco, best known for creating <em>The Purge</em>
franchise, and Cantor, an actor-turned-writer, talk about their favorite
horror films from the 1970s, the challenge of bringing a 70s vibe to
modern horror films, and working with their Staten Island buddy,
comedian Pete Davidson and bringing out his intense dramatic
performance.<br><br>DeMonaco also talks about the impact <em>The
Purge</em> films have had on our culture. <br><br>“I grew up watching
Romero and Carpenter films and George Miller. I always thought they put
great mirrors up to society, and there was always some kind of
smuggler’s cinema idea, where they were smuggling socio-political themes
into the genre’s pieces. So sadly, <em>The Purge</em> is reflective of
the world we’re living in and becoming, I think, more reflective, which
is scary. And terrifying. I wish it wasn’t, I wish it was a complete
fantasy to purge. Unfortunately, it’s not right now, and it’s seemingly
getting worse,” says DeMonaco who weighs in on whether something like
<em>The Purge</em> could happen in real life. <br><br>“I used to say,
‘Absolutely not!’ Now, I don’t know if I would say that any longer, and
that’s even scarier to me,” says DeMonaco. <br><br>To hear more about
<em>The Home</em> and the spooky events that happened on set, listen to
the podcast.  <br><br>

Fifty years ago,
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000229/?ref_=tt_ov_1_1">Steven
Spielberg</a>’s
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073195/" style="font-style: italic;">Jaws</a>(1975)
became a cultural phenomenon. The film took the box office by storm in
the summer of 1975, becoming the highest grossing movie ever made at the
time and receiving
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073195/awards/">four Academy
Award nominations</a> including Best Picture, and three
wins. <br><br>Based on
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001940/">Peter Benchley</a>’s
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/12/books/booksupdate/jaws-peter-benchley-50.html">hit
novel</a>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Jaws</span> tells the story
of a New York City cop, played by
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001702/">Roy Scheider</a>, who
moves his family to a quiet beach community, only to be confronted by
the threat of a killer great white shark. Despite its infamously
troubled production, plagued by technical issues with the mechanical
shark and the perils of shooting on the open ocean, when the movie hit
screens it captured the global imagination, defining the summer
blockbuster and launching Spielberg into the stratosphere. <br><br>To
celebrate the 50th anniversary, Disney has released
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32743685/companycredits/?ref_=tt_dt_cmpy"><span
style="font-style: italic;">Jaws @ 50: The Definitive Inside

<a href="https://www.hulu.com/welcome">Hulu</a> and the

filmmaker and writer,
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0100522/">Laurent Bouzereau</a>,
who has made many docs on Spielberg’s films dating back to the 1990s,

One of the best ways for a screenwriter to learn their craft is to see
how the masters did it and <span style="font-weight: bold;">read the
screenplays</span> to popular and acclaimed movies. <br><br>In most
cases, if a script got produced and turned into a successful film, there
were several things working for it on the page. When a producer, studio
exec or director reads a screenplay and thinks ‘This is a movie,’ it’s
because the screenwriter <em>wrote a movie</em>. All the below <span
style="font-weight: bold;">screenplay examples</span> read like movies.
Furthermore, they read like great movies, and you can imagine the
excitement of the industry professionals reading them for the first
time. <br><br>Screenplay analysis of how legendary screenwriters crafted
compelling characters, intricate plots, and unforgettable dialogue is
the best film school you could ever attend. After the screenplay
examples, I’ll give tips on <span style="font-weight: bold;">How To
Study a Script</span> effectively and apply what you’ve learned to your
own screenwriting.<br><br>The below <span
style="font-weight: bold;">movie script examples</span> were chosen to
represent different
<a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/what-genre-is-my-screenplay">movie
genres</a> and varied approaches to the scriptwriting process. They also
range from the 1970s to present-day. They’re all scripts that not only
went on to become popular and acclaimed movies, but have also been
singled out as accomplished written works.

For younger movie-goers, there was never a world without Quentin
Tarantino. His last four genre epics,
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361748/" style="font-style: italic;">Inglourious
Basterds</a> (2009),
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1853728/" style="font-style: italic;">Django
Unchained</a> (2012),
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3460252/" style="font-style: italic;">The
Hateful Eight</a> (2015) and
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7131622/" style="font-style: italic;">Once
Upon A Time In Hollywood</a>… (2019), were all box office hit Academy
Award winners starring A-list movie stars, and in all likelihood, his
in-the-works tenth and
<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/quentin-tarantino-final-film-delay-sundance-1235248450/">self-proclaimed
final film</a> will be too.
</p>
<p>
In addition to directing, he has also written every movie he’s ever
made. But Tarantino’s 30+ long career was never guaranteed. After the
phenomenal success of <span style="font-style: italic;">Pulp
Fiction</span>, his sophomore feature, there was plenty of public
skepticism as to whether this film geek wunderkind was
<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/7165045/Quentin-Tarantino-interview-All-my-movies-are-achingly-personal.html">a
flash in the pan</a> or had what it took to be around for the long haul.
Decades later, Tarantino has proven a remarkable ability to
strategically navigate the industry in a way that’s allowed him to stay
true to his artistic vision, while carving out longevity as a
writer-director.<br><br>The story of how Tarantino broke into Hollywood
against all odds in the 90s is worthy of study for any aspiring
filmmaker. His strategic navigation of career scrutiny until he became
an industry mainstay further cements his journey as a valuable case
study for screenwriters and would-be auteurs everywhere. <br><br>Here is
how Tarantino strategically played the long game during his first decade
as a filmmaker to establish lasting relevance in the industry.

At some point in your screenwriting journey and career, you’re going to
need to write a <span style="font-weight: bold;">“Risk It”
Script</span>. The original term begins with another four-letter word
beginning with F, but we’re taking the family approach for this
discussion.<br><br>Screenwriters are bombarded with <em>musts</em>. You
read the screenwriting books, you listen to the screenwriting podcasts,
you watch interviews with successful name screenwriters, you attend
screenwriting Q/A panels and listen to industry pros tell you what you
<em>must</em> do to become a professional screenwriter. All of those
<em>musts</em> can create extreme anxiety and overwhelmingness — all of
which can crush your dreams and subdue your passion and drive. And,
oddly enough, many of those <em>musts</em>, rules, and guidelines can
contradict one another. <br><br>If you’re tired of all of that, it’s
time to write your <span style="font-weight: bold;">“Risk It”
Script</span>.
