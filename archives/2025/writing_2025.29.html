v. Anthropic: Judge Alsup Certifies Class for Rightsholders of 7 Million
Books Used by Anthropic</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-22, from: Author’s Union blog</p>
<p>Late last week Judge Alsup, presiding over the Bartz v. Anthropic
copyright AI litigation, granted a motion to certify a class
representing authors and rightsholders of nearly 7 million books. If you
are a book author (or a publisher, or an heir to an author), you should
be paying attention because there is a good chance that you could be
included in this class.</p>

Quentin Tarantino Rewrote the Rules and Made Hollywood Listen</h2>

For younger movie-goers, there was never a world without Quentin
Tarantino. His last four genre epics,
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361748/" style="font-style: italic;">Inglourious
Basterds</a> (2009),
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1853728/" style="font-style: italic;">Django
Unchained</a> (2012),
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3460252/" style="font-style: italic;">The
Hateful Eight</a> (2015) and
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7131622/" style="font-style: italic;">Once
Upon A Time In Hollywood</a>… (2019), were all box office hit Academy
Award winners starring A-list movie stars, and in all likelihood, his
in-the-works tenth and
<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/quentin-tarantino-final-film-delay-sundance-1235248450/">self-proclaimed
final film</a> will be too.
</p>
<p>
In addition to directing, he has also written every movie he’s ever
made. But Tarantino’s 30+ long career was never guaranteed. After the
phenomenal success of <span style="font-style: italic;">Pulp
Fiction</span>, his sophomore feature, there was plenty of public
skepticism as to whether this film geek wunderkind was
<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/7165045/Quentin-Tarantino-interview-All-my-movies-are-achingly-personal.html">a
flash in the pan</a> or had what it took to be around for the long haul.
Decades later, Tarantino has proven a remarkable ability to
strategically navigate the industry in a way that’s allowed him to stay
true to his artistic vision, while carving out longevity as a
writer-director.<br><br>The story of how Tarantino broke into Hollywood
against all odds in the 90s is worthy of study for any aspiring
filmmaker. His strategic navigation of career scrutiny until he became
an industry mainstay further cements his journey as a valuable case
study for screenwriters and would-be auteurs everywhere. <br><br>Here is
how Tarantino strategically played the long game during his first decade
as a filmmaker to establish lasting relevance in the industry.

Directors</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-22, from: John August blog</p>
<p>
In this compendium episode, John and Craig set their focus on directors
— and how to work with them as a screenwriter. They look at the
inner-workings of the writer-director relationship, etiquette on set,
how to communicate notes from pre-production through post, and outline
the qualities of the “perfect” director. We also offer advice to […]

“Risk It” Script, and Why Should You Write One?</h2>

At some point in your screenwriting journey and career, you’re going to
need to write a <span style="font-weight: bold;">“Risk It”
Script</span>. The original term begins with another four-letter word
beginning with F, but we’re taking the family approach for this
discussion.<br><br>Screenwriters are bombarded with <em>musts</em>. You
read the screenwriting books, you listen to the screenwriting podcasts,
you watch interviews with successful name screenwriters, you attend
screenwriting Q/A panels and listen to industry pros tell you what you
<em>must</em> do to become a professional screenwriter. All of those
<em>musts</em> can create extreme anxiety and overwhelmingness — all of
which can crush your dreams and subdue your passion and drive. And,
oddly enough, many of those <em>musts</em>, rules, and guidelines can
contradict one another. <br><br>If you’re tired of all of that, it’s
time to write your <span style="font-weight: bold;">“Risk It”
Script</span>.
