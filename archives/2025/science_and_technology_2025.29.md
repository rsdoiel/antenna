## How GNOME made its Calendar application accessible

date: 2025-07-25, from: OS News

This article will explain in details about the fundamental issues that held back accessibility in GNOME Calendar since the very beginning of its existence, the progress we have made with accessibility as well as our thought process in achieving it, and the now and future of accessibility in GNOME Calendar. ↫ Hari &#8220;TheEvilSkeleton&#8221; Rana You&#8217;d think it would be easy to make a &#8220;simple&#8221; calendar application properly accessible, but boy would you be wrong. In this article, Hari &#8220;TheEvilSkeleton&#8221; Rana details just how much work had to be done in order to turn GNOME Calendar from entirely inaccessible into an accessible application, and considering the length of the article, you can see it wasn&#8217;t a weekend effort. There were apparently two primary reasons why making GNOME Calendar accessible was so hard. First, maximising GNOME Calendar&#8217;s performance optimisations had significant negative implications for accessibility, and two, the effectively endless flexibility a calendar needs to offer makes it very difficult to create a usable accessibility tree. Both the events on a calendar as well as the zooming view of a calendar lead to a ton of complexity in creating this tree. GNOME Calendar uses a ton of custom widgets, and these all needed specific, individual solutions to be made accessible. As an example, the article mentions that while it was possible to use the keyboard to create an event, it was not possible to use the keyboard to select created events. Obviously, even this one shortcoming alone effectively makes the entire application inaccessible to anyone relying solely on keyboard navigation. The article goes into great detail how both the above widget and countless other widgets were changed to make them accessible to both the keyboard and screen reader. If you&#8217;re working on GTK applications, or even applications using other toolkits, Rana&#8217;s article is a great resource to start to understand the complexities and creative thinking needed to implement accessibility in software properly.

## It’s a DE9, not a DB9

date: 2025-07-25, from: OS News

You’ve seen them everywhere, especially on older computer equipment: the classic 9-pin serial connector. You probably know it as a DB9. It’s an iconic connector for makers, engineers, and anyone who&#8217;s ever used an RS232 serial device. Here&#8217;s a little secret, though: calling it a DB9 is technically wrong. The correct name is actually DE9. ↫ Christo-boots with the-pher at Sparkfun Electronics I honestly had no idea, and looking through the Wikipedia page, it seems this isn&#8217;t the only common misnomer when it comes to D-sub connectors.

## Facebook, Google cease political advertising in the EU because of new EU transparency and accountability law

date: 2025-07-25, from: OS News

Last year the European Union introduced legislation to greatly improve the transparency around political advertising, specifically on social media and websites. The law mandates a few very basic requirements that tend to already apply to many other forms of political advertising, like clearly labeling who paid for the ad and how much was spent, which election or referendum they&#8217;re about, and which targeting techniques were used. In addition, data used for targeting may only be collected from the person being targeted, and the person targeted has to give explicit permission specifically for political advertising. Furthermore, a whole slew of data types are not allowed to be used, such as data that may reveal ethnic or racial origin or political opinions. Lastly, an obvious one: starting three months before an election of referendum, third country sponsors are banned from advertising. It seems these rather basic, elementary requirements are too much for Facebook, as the company today announced it&#8217;s going to stop offering political advertising in the European Union altogether in October of this year. The company cries on its blog: Despite extensive engagement with policymakers to share these concerns, we have been left with an impossible choice: alter our services to offer an advertising product which doesn’t work for advertisers or users, without guarantee that our solution would be viewed as compliant, or stop allowing political, electoral and social issue ads in the EU. We’re not the only company to have been forced into this position. Once again, we’re seeing regulatory obligations effectively remove popular products and services from the market, reducing choice and competition. ↫ Sad Facebook As the link in Facebook&#8217;s above lament points out, Google has also decided to stop offering political advertising in the European Union, for the exact same reasons. Facebook and Google are clearly trying to frame this as &#8220;bad&#8221;, but the only people the removal of hyper-targeted political advertising is bad for are threat actors trying to unduly and illegally influence elections, and of course, for the bottom line of Facebook and Google. Neither of these are of any relevance to the proper execution of fair and free elections, and people all across the European Union will be better off without these two advertising giants providing an easy avenue for shady organisations and foreign entities to unduly influence our elections. Basically, cry me a river Zuck. Nobody likes you.

## You can now run graphical applications in Android’s Linux Terminal

date: 2025-07-24, from: OS News

The Linux Terminal app that Google introduced earlier this year is one of the most exciting new features in Android, not for what it currently does but for what it can potentially do. The Terminal app lets you boot up an instance of Debian in a virtual machine, allowing you to run full-fledged Linux apps that aren’t available on Android. Unfortunately, the current version of the Terminal app is limited to running command line programs, but that’s set to change in the near future. In the new Android Canary build that Google released today, the Terminal app now lets you run graphical Linux apps. ↫ Mishaal Rahman at Android Authority It comes with Weston, the reference implementation of a Wayland compositor, allowing you to run a basic graphical environment and accompanying applications. It won&#8217;t be long before you can take your Pixel, connect a display, and run KDE. Neat, but so many devils are in so many details here, and there&#8217;s so many places where this can fall apart entirely if the wrong decisions are made.

## The most Microsoft support document of all time

date: 2025-07-23, from: OS News

I have stumbled upon the most Microsoft support document of all time. Support for the Microsoft Store installation type of Microsoft 365 Apps is ending. New feature updates will stop in October 2025 and security updates will end in December 2026. If you have the Microsoft Store installation type of Microsoft 365 Apps, you must upgrade to the Click-to-Run installation type for continuing new features and security updates. The following steps show how you can upgrade the installation type of Microsoft 365 products on a PC from the Microsoft Store to Click-to-Run. ↫ End of support for the Microsoft Store installation type of Microsoft 365 Apps There is so much to unpack here. First, if you&#8217;re not neck-deep in Microsoft lore, you might not even know what Microsoft 365 Apps even are. Remember Office 365, the subscription version of Microsoft Office? It&#8217;s called Microsoft 365 now, for some inexplicable reason, but you probably haven&#8217;t noticed because it is a stupidly confusing, nondescript name that nobody out in the real world uses. Adding to the confusion, in 2022, Microsoft announced it would phase out the Office name in favour of calling both the subscription version and the regular, buy-once-run-forever version &#8220;Microsoft 365&#8221;, but then changed their mind a year later, and as such, the regular, buy-once-run-forever version is now still called Office. Oh and there&#8217;s also the &#8220;Microsoft 365 Copilot app (formerly Office)&#8221; (at Office.com?) which I think is what used to be called the mobile iOS/Android Office application, which existed alongside the individual mobile Office applications on these platforms (because that was a thing, too &#8211; maybe still is?)? I don&#8217;t know man, I merely have two university degrees, which clearly isn&#8217;t enough to understand any of this 4D office suite chess. Anyway, the Microsoft 365 Apps (so the subscription version of what was temporarily formerly known as Microsoft Office) can be installed either through the Microsoft Store, which is the application store bundled with Windows that you never use, or through something called Click-to-Run. Apparently, Microsoft is discontinuing the Microsoft Store version of the Microsoft 365 Apps, and is urging everyone to move to the Click-to-Run version of the Microsoft 365 Apps. Alright, we&#8217;re getting really, really deep into the very darkest crevices of the Microsoft Cinematic Universe lore now. The Microsoft Store version of the Microsoft 365 Apps is almost entirely identical to the Click-to-Run version of the Microsoft 365 Apps, except for one tiny part: the exact packaging method of the applications. Whereas the Microsoft Store version is packaged and delivered in Microsoft&#8217;s Appx packaging format (designed for the Universal Windows Platform or UWP), the Click-to-Run version is packaged and delivered through, well, Click-to-Run. So, what is that, exactly? Click-to-Run is an entirely custom application streaming technology specifically designed for and exclusively used by Microsoft Office. You download a very small installer, which then proceeds to download the various Microsoft 365 applications like Word, Excel, and so on, which you can then start using well before the entire download is finished. The technology is similar to Microsoft App-V. It&#8217;s actually remarkably difficult to find detailed documentation about Click-to-Run, which is odd considering Microsoft is usually quite decent at providing documentation for its technologies. So what Microsoft is announcing in this support document is that if you have Microsoft 365 Apps installed through the Microsoft Store, you&#8217;re going to have to switch to the Click-to-Run version. You can check which installation type you&#8217;re using by going to File > Account (it might be called Office Account, because everything is made up and nothing is real) &#8211; under Product information locate the About button, where it&#8217;ll list the installation type. If your installation type is Microsoft Store, you need to switch to the Click-to-Run version to keep receiving updates. To do so, download the Click-to-Run installer and run it, which will automatically remove the Microsoft Store version of the Microsoft 365 Apps and replace them with the Click-to-Run versions. The reason they&#8217;re making you do this is that the Click-to-Run version offers enterprises and corporate customers more control over deployment, update schedules, configuration options, and so on. The Microsoft Store version is more suited for normal consumers, but Microsoft doesn&#8217;t care about those, and never has, and never will. Why is Microsoft?

In April and May, researchers at NASA’s Glenn Research Center in Cleveland built two specialized radio systems to study how well fifth-generation cellular network technology, known as 5G, can handle the demands of air taxi communications.

## Wayback 0.1 released

date: 2025-07-23, from: OS News

Wayback, the recently announced tool that will allow you to run a legacy X11 desktop environment on top of Wayland, has just announced its first release, version 0.1. As the version number implies, there be dragons here, but the developers state some of them already use Wayback on a day-to-day basis. Still, there&#8217;s no multi-monitor support yet, quite a few X.org options are just stubs for now, there&#8217;s no mouse-locking, and so on. Since the initial announcement and the first progress report a few weeks ago, Wayback has become an official part of FreeDesktop.org, which indicates the wider desktop Linux community is definitely interested in what Wayback has to offer. It&#8217;s also been split into several different parts to mimic X.org&#8217;s structure, several distributions have picked it up and packaged it already, and ton more changes have been made. It definitely seems like Wayback has a good chance of becoming a simpler, more straightforward replacement for X.org, greatly reducing the maintenance burden of Linux distributions. Not having to keep the full legacy X.org stack around alongside Wayland is going to save a lot of people a lot of time.

## AROS continues centimetering closer to 64bit

date: 2025-07-22, from: OS News

The work towards making the 64bit version of AROS a viable choice is continuing, as is the work on AROS&#8217; web browser, and developer Krzysztof &#8216;deadwood&#8217; Śmiechowicz gave an update a few days ago detailing the progress that&#8217;s been made &#8211; and it&#8217;s extensive. First, the beta version of Odyssey 3.0, the web browser for AROS, can now load a whole slew of important websites, like YouTube, Google Docs, and Discord, which is a big deal for an alternative operating system like AROS. Odyssey uses Apple&#8217;s WebKit as its browser engine, and it&#8217;s obviously important to make sure it runs on the 64bit version of AROS. Speaking of 64bit, more and more applications are being recompiled to add 64bit support, with the stated goal being to have at least the best application in each category available in 64bit. A major issue is that certain pieces of hardware that work in 32bit do not yet work in 64bit. As a temporary solution, they&#8217;re going to make use of the virtualisation route AROS Portable uses to plug the gaps in 64bit hardware support until such support is realised. AROS Portable is basically a Linux distribution that runs a virtual copy of the 32bit version of AROS. It&#8217;s clear that a lot of work is happening in the 64bit space for AROS, which is crucial for the long-term viability of the project. AROS is still the easiest and most accessible way to get a taste of an Amiga-like experience since it runs on plain x86 hardware, so it&#8217;s important to keep that dream alive.

## FreeBSD 15.0’s installer to gain option to install a full KDE Plasma desktop environment

date: 2025-07-22, from: OS News

One of the things lacking from the FreeBSD installation routine is the easy installation of a full desktop experience, from X11 all the way up to a login manager, desktop environment, and its applications. It seems this might finally change for FreeBSD 15.0, as the FreeBSD Foundation&#8217;s Laptop Support and Usability Improvements project is working on adding support for this to bsdinstall, the FreeBSD installer. Based on a goal set out in this GitHub issue, the way this will work is that through a set of dialogs (which you can check out on GitLab) in the FreeBSD installer, the user can select to install KDE, which will then guide the user through installing the correct graphics driver and adding users to the video group. Once the installation is finished, the computer will reboot and load directly into SDDM, allowing you to log into the installed KDE Plasma desktop environment. For FreeBSD 15.0, our goal is to extend the FreeBSD installer to offer a minimal KDE-based desktop as an install option. The initial concept is a low-interaction installation process that, upon completion, brings the user directly to a KDE graphical login screen. ↫ FreeBSD Foundation Laptop Update &#8211; June 2025 Future plans for desktop users in the FreeBSD installers are more elaborate, and will include additional desktop environments to choose from, the ability to install sets of desktop applications during FreeBSD&#8217;s installation, and yes, even opting for Wayland instead of X11, because FreeBSD developers know which way the wind is blowing. This is excellent news, and will make installing a FreeBSD-based desktop a lot easier for a ton of people. Work isn&#8217;t fully completed just yet, but even if the developers miss their FreeBSD 15.0 target, it&#8217;ll just move on to one of the follow-up releases.

## Microsoft rolls out another set of “AI” tools to Windows 11 users

date: 2025-07-22, from: OS News

Ever wanted Windows to monitor what&#8217;s on your screen continuously and ask it to do stuff for you? Well, have I got news for you: Copilot Vision, as this feature is called, is now rolling out to users in the US. Copilot Vision on Windows, now available in the U.S., is a new way to engage with your Windows 11 PC. When you enable it, it can see what you see on your device and talk to you about it in real time. It acts as your second set of eyes, able to analyze content, help when you’re lost, provide insights and answer your questions as you go. Whether you’re browsing, working or deep in a project, Copilot Vision offers instant insights and answers. ↫ The Windows Experience Blog team Do note that Copilot Vision will not keep its data on your device, instead sending it off to Microsoft. So, if you ever wanted to give Microsoft even more insight into exactly what you&#8217;re doing with your Windows installation, now&#8217;s your chance. Well, if you&#8217;re in the US, that is, and some its capabilities are only available on Snapdragon PCs, not on Intel or AMD machines. In the same blog post, Microsoft also highlights a few actually useful features coming to Windows, like a colour picker in the screenshot tool, the ability to change the lighting in photos, or having the area selector in the screenshot tool snap to what it thinks is the important part you wish to actually take a screenshot of. However, Microsoft is also adding nonsense like sticker generators in Paint, text generators in Word, and stuff related to Teams that makes me even happier than I already am that I&#8217;m self-employed and work alone. If you&#8217;re in the US, you can get these features now if you wish through Windows Update.

## Fedora needs to embrace Flathub, and here’s how that could be done

date: 2025-07-22, from: OS News

Earlier this year, we talked about a peculiar oddity concerning Flatpaks and Fedora: unlike just about any other distribution, Fedora maintains its own Flatpak repository, while everyone else just defaults to Flathub. While there&#8217;s a few technical differences between Fedora Flatpaks and Flathub Flatpaks, the main gist is that the Fedora ones are built using Fedora&#8217;s own RPMs, while Flathub&#8217;s are built using different means. This is an odd situation, since it does not reflect what users really want &#8211; users seem to greatly prefer Flatpaks from Flathub, since they have fewer bugs, are packaged by the applications&#8217; creators, and bugs in Flathub Flatpaks can be reported to the actual developers, whereas bugs in Fedora Flatpaks generally cannot. As such, Fedora users are often surprised to learn that the Flatpak they installed came from Fedora instead of Flathub. Now, since Fedora&#8217;s long-term goal is to make their immutable, Flatpak-focused variants the default, this situation needs to be addressed. As such, Fedora and GNOME developer Michael Catanzaro has published an incredibly detailed article outlining all the issues and possible solutions and courses of action. The basic gist is that before Fedora can consider switching from its own Flatpak repository to Flathub, a number of shortcomings in Flathub must be addressed: Some of these points are fairly obvious, but let&#8217;s go over them anyway. A lot of binaries on Flathub are pre-built in that they are not built using Flathub&#8217;s infrastructure, and as such, you don&#8217;t know if anything has been done to the code between, say, the code&#8217;s release on GitHub and the Flatpak you install on your computer. This obviously needs to change, and ideally, all Flatpaks on Flathub should be reproducible. End-of-life runtimes should obviously also not be a thing, for entirely obvious reasons. Currently, a little under a third of applications on Flathub use end-of-life runtimes, meaning the runtimes they use are not receiving any security updates. The same applies to external dependencies packaged inside Flatpaks; they can be outdated too, but many Flatpaks do not use the designated tool to deal with this issue. Obviously, holes in the Flatpak sandbox should not exist either, again for entirely obvious reasons. Catanzaro proposes a number of solutions to all of these problems, which require work from both Fedora and Flathub to be implemented. On top of that, even once these issues are satisfactorily addressed, there&#8217;s a debate to be had over the exact way in which both the traditional and immutable variants of Fedora move on over to Flathub &#8211; the variant I personally like the most is where the core applications installed by default remain in control of Fedora, while everything else gets installed from Flathub. Of course, this is not of much relevance to people who prefer plain, traditional RPMs &#8211; such as myself &#8211; to whom Flatpaks are more of a &#8220;if all else fails&#8221; option than a default. While the immutable, Flatpak-based variants of Fedora are definitely on their way to become the default option, the traditional RPM variants will not be going anywhere, and will remain an option as well. I think defaulting new users to the immutable variants is the way to go, even if I personally won&#8217;t be using them.

## The Day Earth Smiled

date: 2025-07-21, from: NASA breaking news

On July 19, 2013, NASA’s Cassini spacecraft had a rare opportunity to image Saturn and, far in the background, Earth. This image spans about 404,880 miles (651,591 kilometers) across. With the Sun&#8217;s powerful and potentially damaging rays eclipsed by Saturn itself, Cassini&#8217;s onboard cameras were able to take advantage of this unique viewing geometry. They [&#8230;]

## Microsoft wants to find out why Windows 11 is so slow

date: 2025-07-21, from: OS News

Microsoft wants to know why, exactly, Windows 11 is slow, so it&#8217;s adding a feature in the latest Insider Preview to collect data when a Windows 11 machine is experiencing slowness or sluggishness. As part of our commitment to improving Windows performance, logs are now collected when your PC has experienced any slow or sluggish performance. Windows Insiders are encouraged to provide feedback when experiencing PC issues related to slow or sluggish performance, allowing Feedback Hub to automatically collect these logs, which will help us root cause issues faster. Use the Desktop > System Sluggishness category when filing feedback to allow Feedback Hub to automatically pick up these logs. These logs are stored locally (%systemRoot%\Temp\DiagOutputDir\Whesvc folder) and only sent to Microsoft via Feedback Hub when feedback is submitted. ↫ Amanda Langowski and Brandon LeBlanc In case you want to solve performance problems with Windows 11, just go here and follow the steps, and your computer will be spry as a Spring chicken in a few minutes. I am very funny.

## Mwm: an X11 window manager in 20 lines of code

date: 2025-07-21, from: OS News

Is KDE too much for you? GNOME tries to do too much? Xfce still a bit too fancy? Do you need something smaller? Even more minimalist? What about a mere 20 lines of code which provide the absolute barest possible minimum of window management functionality? You need mwm. This is the smallest, actually usable window manager I know about. Even TinyWM is twice as large. However, it doesn&#8217;t let you launch programs, or assign key bindings. mwm does. ↫ Mwm&#8217;s GitHub page It will open a window, and let you switch between windows, that are always fullscreen. No titlebars, no virtual desktops, no menus, no nothing. This is the true minimalist&#8217;s experience.

## An artificially complex XML schema as a lock-in tool

date: 2025-07-21, from: OS News

The Document Foundation, which developers LibreOffice, is mad at Microsoft for the levels of complexity in the Microsoft 365 document format. They claim Microsoft intentionally makes this format&#8217;s XML schema as complex and obtuse as possible to lock users into the Microsoft Office ecosystem. This artificial complexity is characterised by a deeply nested tag structure with excessive abstraction, dozens or even hundreds of optional or overloaded elements, non-intuitive naming conventions, the widespread use of extension points and wildcards, the multiple import of namespaces and type hierarchies, and sparse or cryptic documentation. In the case of the Microsoft 365 document format, the only characteristic not present is sparse or cryptic documentation, given that we are talking about a set of documents totalling over 8,000 pages. All the other characteristics are present to a greater or lesser extent, making life almost impossible for a developer trying to implement the schema. ↫ Italo Vignoli I feel like this was widely known already, since I distinctly remember the discussions around the standardisation process for the Office Open XML file formats. Then, too, it was claimed that Microsoft&#8217;s then-new XML file formats were far more complex and obtuse than the existing, already standardised OpenDocument file formats, and that there was no need to push Microsoft&#8217;s new file formats through the process. These days, you might wonder how relevant all of this still is, but considering vast swaths of the private, corporate, government, and academic world still run on Microsoft Office and its default file formats, it&#8217;s definitely still a hugely relevant matter. As an office suite, you are basically required to support Office Open XML, and if Microsoft is making that more complex and obtuse on purpose, that&#8217;s a form of monopoly abuse that should be addressed.
