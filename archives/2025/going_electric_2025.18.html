Professional salespeople love to talk about “the steps of the sale,” a
tried-and-true process that guides every customer from curiosity to
closed. But when it comes to electric cars, that old-school hustle can
fall flat, leaving dealers struggling with how to fit them into their
familiar playbook. But what if I told you, dear dealer, that there’s a
whole category of vehicles on existing dealer lots that need to be
approached in <em>exactly</em> the same way as an EV to score a
successful sale that you’re already familiar with?
</p>
<p>
That category: Heavy-duty tow trucks. Here’s how selling one is a lot
like selling the other.
