I’ve spent countless hours here at <em>Electrek</em> doing detailed
<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/01/11/radtrike-review-testing-rad-power-bikes-electric-trike/">hands-on
testing</a> of hundreds of electric bikes. Through thousands of miles of
riding, I’ve been fortunate to learn these e-bikes inside and out, top
to bottom and front to back. That long-term experience with real-world
e-bike testing has helped me find the best electric bicycles on the
market for just about any budget.
</p>
<p>
Below are some of the top e-bikes I’ve hand-tested for every price
range, current as of May 2025. Summer is so close we can feel it, making
this a great chance to start the riding season off with a fun and
efficient electric bicycle! So check out the awesome e-bikes below, any
one of which could become your next electric bike.

It’s not the IONIQ 4, but
<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/hyundai/">Hyundai</a> promises it
will be a game changer. After unveiling its new electric SUV, ELEXIO,
Hyundai said it’s about to “write a new chapter” in the world’s largest
EV market. With a sleek design and up to 435 miles (700 km) driving
range, this could be Hyundai’s next big hit.

<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/byd/">BYD</a> is already known for
its smaller, low-cost electric cars like the Seagull, which you can snag
for under $10,000 in China. Now, China’s EV leader is looking to go even
smaller. BYD plans to launch a new mini EV, or kei car, that could pose
“a huge threat” to Japanese automakers as a cheaper alternative.

I recently had the opportunity to test out the new Vortex plug adapter

Tesla Supercharger network. In my opinion, a NACS to CCS adapter is a
vital tool for any BEV owner, and this one from Lectron is simple and
effective to utilize.

It’s taken a while, but most Americans have finally come to realize that
the new tariffs imposed on imported goods are in fact paid by US
companies, not the countries where they are manufactured. What many
still don’t realize, though, is how those same tariffs are actually
crushing the American manufacturing they were ostensibly designed to
promote.

In true Lectric style, North America’s largest e-bike company just

Professional salespeople love to talk about “the steps of the sale,” a
tried-and-true process that guides every customer from curiosity to
closed. But when it comes to electric cars, that old-school hustle can
fall flat, leaving dealers struggling with how to fit them into their
familiar playbook. But what if I told you, dear dealer, that there’s a
whole category of vehicles on existing dealer lots that need to be
approached in <em>exactly</em> the same way as an EV to score a
successful sale that you’re already familiar with?
</p>
<p>
That category: Heavy-duty tow trucks. Here’s how selling one is a lot
like selling the other.
