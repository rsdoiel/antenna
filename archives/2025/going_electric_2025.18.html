In true Lectric style, North America’s largest e-bike company just
unveiled the latest generation of its best-selling electric bike in a
high-energy, adrenaline-fueled product launch this morning. The
<a href="https://lectricebikes.sjv.io/vnANkv">Lectric XP4</a> is the
newest generation of the ultra-popular e-bike line, and once again
brings a shocking level of upgrades at price points never before seen in
the industry.
</p>
<p>
To put it simply, Lectric has done it again; they’ve absolutely crushed
it and set a new high watermark for value in the US folding e-bike
market.

Professional salespeople love to talk about “the steps of the sale,” a
tried-and-true process that guides every customer from curiosity to
closed. But when it comes to electric cars, that old-school hustle can
fall flat, leaving dealers struggling with how to fit them into their
familiar playbook. But what if I told you, dear dealer, that there’s a
whole category of vehicles on existing dealer lots that need to be
approached in <em>exactly</em> the same way as an EV to score a
successful sale that you’re already familiar with?
</p>
<p>
That category: Heavy-duty tow trucks. Here’s how selling one is a lot
like selling the other.
