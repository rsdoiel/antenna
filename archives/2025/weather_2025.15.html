Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0742 AM CDT Wed Apr 16 2025

Valid 161300Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS LATE THIS
AFTERNOON INTO TONIGHT FROM THE TEXAS PANHANDLE TO NORTHEAST KANSAS
AND VICINITY...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated large hail and strong-severe outflow gusts are possible
this evening into tonight from parts of the southern and central
Plains into the lower to mid Missouri Valley.

...TX Panhandle to northeast KS and vicinity through tonight...
Midlevel ridging will shift slowly eastward from the Great Plains to
the MS Valley by tonight, as a midlevel trough digs southward toward
the northern Great Basin and begins to phase with a closed low off
the CA coast.  This pattern will favor west-southwesterly flow over
the Rockies and lee cyclogenesis across the central High Plains. 
Northward advection of a modifying Gulf air mass will occur from TX
to KS, beneath an elevated mixed layer.  Thunderstorm development
will become possible late this afternoon/evening from the TX
Panhandle into southwest KS, where surface heating and sufficiently
deep mixing occur along the developing dryline.  MLCAPE of 1000-1500
J/kg and long hodographs will favor high-based supercells capable of
producing isolated large hail and strong-severe outflow gusts. 
Confidence in diurnal storm development is modest, but storms that
form (especially across KS) could persist/spread eastward overnight
with a strengthening low-level jet and associated warm advection.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0351 AM CDT Wed Apr 16 2025

Valid 191200Z - 241200Z

...DISCUSSION...
Severe potential remains apparent into the weekend, but
predictability wanes substantially by D5/Sunday. 

...D4/Saturday...
The persistent longwave trough is expected to breakdown as an
embedded northern-stream shortwave impulse accelerates east across
ON/QC and the basal shortwave impulse moves more gradually east into
the southern High Plains. Through Saturday afternoon, an expansive
swath of strong mid-level flow will persist from the central
Appalachians southwestward into the southern Great Plains. The
nearly stalled baroclinic zone from TX/OK into the Lower OH Valley
will likely be modulated by ongoing convection on Saturday morning.
But with appreciable boundary-layer heating of a seasonably moist
air mass to the south-southeast, scattered severe storms are
plausible from the Upper OH Valley through central TX. 

...D5/Sunday...
The 00Z GFS and related GEFS are substantially different relative to
24 hours ago with the evolution of the compact shortwave trough
ejecting across the southern Great Plains and the attendant synoptic
cyclone. Most other guidance has remained relatively consistent to
prior days with probable cyclogenesis from OK to the Lower MO
Valley. This would result in a confined belt of strong mid-level
southwesterlies overlapping a broad warm sector with rich western
Gulf moisture. Potentially extensive convection in parts of OK/TX on
Sunday morning does complicate exactly how far north-northwest
appreciable destabilization may occur into the Ozarks/Lower MO
Valley and beyond. Overall setup outside of the GFS-based guidance
appears to support scattered severe storms across the South-Central
States on Sunday afternoon/evening.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
THE NORTHEAST AND NEW ENGLAND...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated wind damage will remain possible into the early evening
across parts of the Northeast.

...20Z Northeast...
The prior outlooks remains largely unchanged with only minor
modifications. Broad-scale ascent beneath the upper low over the
Eastern US is supporting scattered, but shallow convection across
the Northeast and New England. Low-topped thunderstorms will likely
continue to pose a risk for occasional damaging gusts this
afternoon. Limited moisture, and resulting buoyancy will continue to
be the limiting factor for more sustained/stronger storms. Have
trimmed the western extent of the Thunder area over parts of PA/OH.
Scattered non-severe storms are also possible over the Four Corners
and western US, see the previous discussion for more info.

..Lyons.. 04/15/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1114 AM CDT Tue Apr 15 2025/

...Northeast...
Within the base of an eastward-moving large-scale trough over the
eastern CONUS, a related 100+ kt midlevel jet streak will pivot
eastward across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast today. Ascent in the
left-exit region of the jet will promote widely scattered,
low-topped convection across the Northeast through the afternoon.
Despite limited post-frontal boundary-layer moisture, diurnal
heating beneath very cold midlevel temperatures will continue to
steepen low-level lapse rates amid strengthening low/mid-level
winds. This environment will support locally damaging convective
wind gusts (45-60 mph) through the afternoon -- especially with any
small clusters/lines that can evolve.  

...Four Corners into southern Colorado...
Isolated high-based thunderstorms are expected across parts of the
Four Corners and southern CO this afternoon, where midlevel moisture
atop a diurnally deepening boundary layer will yield inverted-V
profiles. As a result, a couple locally strong downbursts cannot be
entirely ruled out.

0218 PM CDT Tue Apr 15 2025

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF EASTERN ARIZONA AND
MUCH OF NEW MEXICO...

...Southwest...
An approaching upper-level trough will provide increasing  southwest
flow aloft atop a very dry boundary layer over the Desert Southwest
region. Relative humidity should drop below 10 percent across much
of the lowland areas of southeastern Arizona/Southwestern New Mexico
during peak heating along with widespread 10-15 percent RH spread
across the area by tomorrow afternoon. Expanded Critical and
Elevated highlights due to higher confidence indicated from latest
model guidance consensus.

...Central High Plains...
Elevated mid-level westerly flow will promote downslope drying and
surface wind speeds of 15-20 mph across portions of southeastern
Wyoming and western Nebraska. Minimal precipitation in the area over
the last few days has allowed finer dormant/dead fuels to remain
receptive. Added area of Elevated fire weather conditions to reflect
overall fire weather threat.

..Williams/Moore.. 04/15/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0130 AM CDT Tue Apr 15 2025/

...Synopsis...
An upper low off the southern California coast will begin to phase
with a trough within the Northwest. Strong mid-level winds will
develop over the Southwest by late afternoon. A surface low will
deepen near the Colorado/Kansas border.

...Southwest...
A broad area of elevated to critical fire weather is expected from
southern/eastern Arizona into much of New Mexico and parts of
southeast Colorado. Strong mid-level winds and the deepening surface
low will combine to promote 15-25 mph surface winds (highest in
terrain-favored areas). Critical fire weather is most likely to
occur from southeast Arizona into southwest/west-central New Mexico.
Here, strong winds will combine with areas of 5-15% RH. Elsewhere
within the region, combinations of weaker winds and slightly higher
RH (10-20%) will preclude critical highlights.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IOWA...NORTHERN
MISSOURI...EASTERN/CENTRAL NEBRASKA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered severe thunderstorms, with a primary threat of large hail,
are possible on Thursday evening/night, centered on eastern/central
Nebraska, northern Missouri, and Iowa.

...Synopsis...
Large scale troughing is progged from portions of the Canadian
Prairies into the Intermountain West and Great Basin on Thursday. A
deepening surface low will shift eastward across the northern
central/high Plains, with a dryline extending from southern Nebraska
into central Kansas and Oklahoma. A triple point formed by a
secondary surface low circulation, dryline, and a frontal
boundary/modified outflow in central Nebraska will be the focus of
additional development by the late afternoon/evening across
central/eastern Nebraska.

...Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri...
Elevated thunderstorm activity is expected to be ongoing at the
beginning of the D3 period across portions of eastern Nebraska into
western Iowa and Missouri. Some instances of severe hail will be
possible with this activity.

Moisture return will be ongoing through much of the day, with upper
50s to 60s dew points from central Nebraska into Iowa, eastern
Kansas, and western Missouri. Additional development is expected
late afternoon into the early evening across the aforementioned
triple point in central Nebraska. Daytime heating and moisture
return will yield MLCAPE around 1500-2000 J/kg amid steep low to
mid-level lapse rates and ample deep layer shear. This environment
will support supercells, some of which may be initially surface
based and capable of very large hail and damaging wind. Further east
across Iowa and northern Missouri, MLCIN will be in place behind
morning convection. Cells may become elevated with eastward
movement, but will still pose potential for large hail and damaging
wind. The Slight was expanded westward into Nebraska to support this
potential. Storms will continue into portions of western Illinois
through the end of the period.

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PORTIONS OF THE
CENTRAL GREAT PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms, with a primary threat of large hail,
are possible on Wednesday evening/night across parts of the central
Great Plains.

...Synopsis...
A progressive open wave trough will shift southward from Canada
before phasing with an upper-level low off the west coast of
California on Wednesday. The subtropical jet will spread eastward
across the central Plains, with several embedded shortwave
disturbances rippling through the flow. Westerly flow across the
central/southern Rockies will promote lee cyclogenesis late in the
period, with an increase in a southerly low-level jet across the
southern/central Plains. 

...Central Great Plains...
Southerly return flow will bring an increase of moisture into the
central Plains, with potential for isolated to scattered
thunderstorm development. A limiting factor remains increasing CIN
and low-level stability beneath a strong EML. Regardless, agreement
has increased on convective initiation occurring near the dryline
across portions of central/southern Kansas late in the period. Given
the elevated nature of this convection, the greatest risk will be
for large hail. This will continue into the lower MO Valley through
the end of the period Thursday morning.

Earlier in the period, some potential exists for development further
south near the OK/KS border toward the end of peak heating in the
early evening. A few hi-res solutions have hinted at development of
a supercell or two within this region, apparent in UH tracks from
the 12z HREF. Conditionally, an established supercell in this region
could support very large hail, given steep lapse rates aloft and
ample shear/CAPE.

...Elsewhere...
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are expected from
northern/central California into the Great Basin and northern
Rockies through the period. These are expected to be sub-severe
given weak shear profiles.

1135 AM CDT Tue Apr 15 2025

Valid 151700Z - 161200Z

...Arizona/New Mexico...
Increasing but still modest mid-level flow ahead of an upper-level
trough combined with a very dry, well-mixed boundary layer is still
expected to result in Elevated fire weather conditions across
southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico today.

...Appalachians...
Farther east, post-frontal winds from the northwest at 15-20 mph
coincident with leeward downslope drying from the Appalachians are
expected today across the Piedmont region. However, fuels are less
receptive to wildfire spread as green-up accelerates across the area
so Elevated highlights were withheld.

..Williams/Moore.. 04/15/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0128 AM CDT Tue Apr 15 2025/

...Synopsis...
A cold front will move off the East Coast, leaving a dry airmass in
its wake. A surface high will push cooler air into the Plains and
into parts of the southern Rockies. A belt of stronger mid-level
winds will be present within the Southwest. Embedded shortwave
troughs may further enhance these winds locally.

...Arizona/New Mexico...
The shortwave trough expected to impact eastern Arizona and western
New Mexico has had a slight weakening trend in guidance. Even so,
some enhancement to the mid-level winds are expected to occur during
the afternoon. West of the cold air intrusion in the southern
Rockies, temperatures will warm into the 80s to perhaps near 90 F.
This will support RH of 15-20%. Winds will not be particularly
strong, but 15 mph with localized pockets of 20 mph is possible.
Elevated fire weather is expected.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0110 PM CDT Mon Apr 14 2025

Areas affected...parts of cntrl/sern SD...swrn MN...nern IA...nern
NE

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 141810Z - 142115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Showers spreading southeastward through the mid Missouri
Valley may begin to intensify by 3-4 PM CDT, with a few weak
thunderstorms developing and posing increasing potential for strong
to severe surface gusts while spreading southeastward through the
remainder of the afternoon.

DISCUSSION...In the wake of a deep cyclone, now migrating northeast
of the Upper Great Lakes region, downward mixing of momentum is
already contributing to 30-35+ kt northwesterly surface gusts across
much of the middle Missouri Valley, as boundary-layer warming
progresses.  This is occurring just ahead of a vigorous short wave
trough now digging through the western Dakotas, and forecast to
continue rapidly southeastward through early evening.  

Models indicate that the mid-level cold core (including -30 to -35C
around 500 mb) will overspread a corridor from central South Dakota
through northeastern Iowa between 20-23Z, coincident with further
strengthening of northwesterly flow (35-40+ kt) in the 850-700 mb
layer and peak afternoon surface heating.  As this occurs, forecast
soundings indicate that profiles will become increasingly conducive
to deepening convection capable of producing lightning. 

With at least some further intensification of ongoing developing
convection, evaporative cooling and melting of precipitation within
an increasing well-mixed boundary layer (characterized by sizable
surface temperature/dew point spreads on the order of 20+ F),
coupled with the downward mixing of stronger flow aloft, seems
likely to contribute to increasing potential for surface gusts
approaching or briefly exceeding severe limits.  This may continue
into early evening, as convection spreads southeastward, before
rapidly diminishing with the onset of boundary-layer cooling.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 138
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
325 PM EDT Mon Apr 14 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central and Eastern Kentucky
  Southern Ohio
  Far Southwestern Pennsylvania
  Southwestern Virginia
  West Virginia

* Effective this Monday afternoon and evening from 325 PM until
  1100 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms coverage is expected to increase over the
next few hours along and ahead of a cold front pushing eastward
across the region. Environmental conditions support strong to severe
storms. An initially cellular mode will favor large hail and
damaging gusts before a transition to a more linear storm mode
favors primarily damaging gusts.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles north and south of a line from 30 miles west of
Lexington KY to 60 miles north northeast of White Sulphur Springs
WV. For a complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch
outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
24040.
