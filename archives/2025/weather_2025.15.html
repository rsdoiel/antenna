Mesoscale Discussion 0504
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0246 PM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

Areas affected...Northwest/north-central Arkansas into southern
Missouri

Concerning...Tornado Watch 154...

Valid 201946Z - 202115Z

The severe weather threat for Tornado Watch 154 continues.

SUMMARY...Storms moving into north-central Arkansas and southern
Missouri will pose a risk of tornadoes--some strong--and damaging
winds. There are signs of discrete storms within the line in
northwest/west-central Arkansas. These storms would bring the
greatest tornado risk.

DISCUSSION...KSRX radar imagery shows a few semi-discrete storms in
far western Arkansas. MRMS CAPPI data also shows these storms
intensifying. Mid-level ascent with southern extent will remain more
limited, but deep-layer shear vectors slightly more perpendicular to
the cold front will also favor discrete storms. VAD data from
KSGF/KLZK/KLSX all have shown an increase in low-level SRH over the
past couple of hours. This trend should continue, particularly in
Missouri. Supercell and QLCS tornadoes, some of which could be
strong, are all possible in this environment. Additionally, the more
linear convective elements will also pose a threat of wind damage.

Mesoscale Discussion 0502
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0220 PM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

Areas affected...Eastern Missouri into western Illinois and far
southeastern Iowa

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 201920Z - 202115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A tornado watch will be forthcoming for portions of
eastern Missouri into western Illinois and far southeastern Iowa, as
a warm frontal boundary continues to lift northward out of central
Missouri.

DISCUSSION...Breaks in cloud cover, along with a northward-lifting
surface warm frontal boundary, have resulted in continued
destabilization across eastern Missouri into western Illinois. With
mixed-layer CAPE forecast to exceed 1000 J/kg in the presence of
strong wind shear (and strong curvature of the low-level hodograph
in the vicinity of the front), the tornado threat is expected to
increase this afternoon into the evening hours. 

Ongoing storms along the MO/KS/OK borders are forecast to continue
north and east into the new watch area, with supercells embedded
within a largely linear complex. Any embedded supercells (especially
any within the vicinity of the warm front), as well as any
pre-frontal storms, will have access to an environment characterized
by strong low-level shear/streamwise vorticity supportive of tornado
development. Current VAD wind profiles from KLSX show 200 m^2/s^2 of
0-500m storm relative helicity -- nearly double what is shown in the
current SPC Mesoanalysis. Given the environmental support for
tornadoes, some of which may be strong, a tornado watch is
anticipated within the next hour or two.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Tornado Watch Number 154
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1200 PM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Tornado Watch for portions of 
  western and central Arkansas
  southeastern Kansas
  northwestern Louisiana
  central and southern Missouri
  eastern Oklahoma
  far northeastern Texas

* Effective this Sunday afternoon and evening from NOON until 700
  PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Several tornadoes likely with a couple intense tornadoes
    possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Scattered large hail events to 1.5 inches in diameter possible

SUMMARY...A steady increase in coverage and intensity of
thunderstorms is expected to occur over the next several hours, with
severe-weather potential evolving from eastern Oklahoma and the
Arklatex region northward into Missouri.  Along with risk for fairly
widespread damaging wind gusts and hail, several tornadoes are
expected -- including potential for a few that are
strong/longer-lived.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 75 statute miles
east and west of a line from 45 miles north of Springfield MO to 25
miles west of Texarkana AR. For a complete depiction of the watch
see the associated watch outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU4).

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

Valid 202000Z - 211200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS NORTHERN
ARKANSAS AND MISSOURI VICINITY...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected today across parts of the ArkLaTex
into the Ozarks and mid Mississippi Valley, mainly this afternoon
and evening. The best corridor for tornadoes (some of which could be
strong) and scattered to numerous damaging winds should exist from
central/northern Arkansas into Missouri.

...20z Update..
A broken line of thunderstorm activity continues near the surface
low in northeastern OK/southeastern KS and along an attendant
surface cold front extending from eastern OK southward into
northeastern Texas/southern Arkansas. This activity is expected to
continue to shift north and eastward through time as the low tracks
to the east through the afternoon and evening. 

Storm intensity has been increasing over the last couple of hours,
owing to daytime heating ahead of the front, where MLCAPE around
500-1500 J/kg is observed in surface objective analysis. VAD
profiles across eastern Arkansas northward into Missouri show strong
low-level shear in place, with large curved hodographs and rich
low-level SRH. This trend will continue with the strengthening
low-level jet lifting through the Mississippi Valley into the
Midwest this evening, supporting risk for embedded supercells and
tornadoes, a few of which may be strong. In addition to the tornado
threat, bowing structures along the front will support risk for
damaging winds. See MCD#502 and MCD#504 for more information.

Thunderstorm coverage will increase along the southern portion of
the front in central/eastern Texas into Louisiana through the
afternoon and evening. This region is somewhat removed from the area
of greater low and mid-level flow, which will keep severe potential
more limited. See previous discussion for more information.

..Thornton/Goss.. 04/20/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1129 AM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025/

...Synopsis...
A compact upper low currently moving into western Oklahoma will
shift quickly northeastward this afternoon and tonight, crossing
eastern Kansas and western Missouri this evening and then continuing
northeastward across Iowa and into Wisconsin tonight.  Fast
southwesterly flow aloft will exist in advance of this system,
within the tight height gradient between this feature and the
persistent ridge centered over the Southeast.

At the surface, a developing low analyzed over western Oklahoma at
15Z is forecast to progress northeastward across southeastern Kansas
and Missouri through the afternoon, and then should continue
northward toward -- and eventually into -- southern Wisconsin by
early Monday morning.  While a warm front lifts northward across the
Mid Mississippi Valley/Midwest, a cold front trailing from the low
will sweep eastward into/across Missouri and Arkansas this afternoon
and evening, and then across the Mid and Lower Mississippi Valleys
through the end of the period.

...Northeastern Texas northeastward to the western Illinois
vicinity...
An expansive area of multi-level cloud cover, along with ongoing
convection, is evident across western and northern portions of the
risk area late this morning, which continues to retard more
substantial heating at this point.  With that said, some breaks in
the clouds are evident per recent visible imagery as far west as
eastern Oklahoma, with thinning cloud cover with
eastward/northeastward extent into Arkansas and the Ozarks.

As the surface low over Oklahoma deepens through the day in tandem
with the advance of the upper low, northward advance of the warm
front with time will allow a moist boundary layer to likewise
overspread much of Missouri and Illinois through sunset.  This,
combined with at least modest heating across portions of the area
should yield an amply unstable environment (500 to near 1500 J/kg
mixed-layer CAPE) to gradually evolve -- supporting a steady
increase in convective coverage and intensity this afternoon.

In contrast to the rather modest thermodynamic environment, a very
favorable low-level and deep-layer wind field is evident, with
respect to development of organized/rotating storms.  An 80 kt
mid-level jet will spread northeastward across the risk area with
time, atop a 50-plus kt low-level jet.  This will support vigorous
updraft evolution, with all-hazards severe risk evolving as a
result.  At this time, it remains apparent that tornado potential --
including risk for a couple of strong tornadoes -- should maximize
across the Ozarks, and areas just north and south, as surface winds
back to southeasterly ahead of the deepening/advancing surface low. 
The primary risk should evolve with an anticipated, broken band of
storms within the cold-frontal zone, including embedded supercells.

Along with the tornado potential, fairly widespread coverage of
damaging wind gusts is also expected, as complex, LEWP/bow-type
structures are expected within the band of storms, as convection
advances eastward across Missouri and Arkansas toward the
Mississippi Valley through the afternoon and into the evening hours.
Severe risk is expected to expand as far north as southeastern Iowa
and adjacent western Illinois this evening, where weaker instability
is expected, and as far south as eastern Texas where a weaker wind
field with southward extent should limit severe potential on the
southern fringe.  Risk should very gradually diminish overnight as
convection shifts eastward across the Mid-Mississippi Valley.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0226 PM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PORTIONS OF
THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...SUMMARY...
Isolated severe thunderstorms are possible on Tuesday across
portions of the southern Plains.

...Synopsis...
Modest west-southwesterly flow is forecast from the Southwest to the
southern Plains on Tuesday with a stronger mid-level jet across the
northern Plains and a sharpening trough in the Pacific Northwest. A
weak mid-level shortwave trough (indicated by most guidance) is
forecast to cross New Mexico during the afternoon which would result
in a sharpening dryline and perhaps some lee cyclogenesis.

...Southern High Plains into southern Kansas...
Low-level moisture advection and strong heating across the southern
High Plains will lead to moderate to strong destabilization ahead of
the dryline.  As this airmass becomes uncapped by early to
mid-afternoon and ascent increases ahead of the approaching
mid-level shortwave trough, expect scattered thunderstorm
development. A deeply mixed boundary layer and 25 to 35 knots of
shear will support supercells capable of large hail and severe wind
gusts. Storms will likely congeal into an MCS by later in the
evening as the low-level jet strengthens with some severe wind
threat which could continue into the overnight hours. 

A remnant frontal boundary will likely be in place across southern
Kansas Tuesday afternoon which will likely be an additional focus
for potential severe storms Tuesday afternoon. Moisture/instability
remains more questionable across southern Kansas, and shear is not
forecast to be quite as strong amid somewhat veered low-level flow
ahead of the front. Therefore, a marginal risk (level 1 of 5) has
been maintained at this time.

...Central Iowa to southern Wisconsin and Northern Illinois... 
Moisture recovery along a warm frontal zone may lead to some weak
instability from eastern Iowa into southern Wisconsin and northern
Illinois. Sustained isentropic ascent may provide sufficient forcing
for isolated to scattered thunderstorm development through the day.
Despite the lack of moisture, cool temperatures aloft and steep
lapse rates may support the potential for isolated large hail and
damaging wind gusts.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0226 PM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...19z Update...
The prior outlook remains valid with only minor changes. Some
adjustments were made to the Elevated area over the central high
Plains to better align with surface trough and axis of stronger
winds. Some areas were also trimmed where fuel green up has
occurred. 

A few hours of breezy winds and relatively dry surface conditions
are possible across southwestern FL Monday afternoon. Dry fuels are
in place and no rainfall is expected. However, winds should be
weaker than the prior couple of days, suggesting fire-weather
concerns will be more localized. See the prior outlook for more
info.

..Lyons.. 04/20/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0208 AM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will impinge on the Northeast as a second
mid-level trough ejects into the northern Plains tomorrow (Monday).
Accompanying surface lows over the north-central and northeastern
CONUS will encourage moisture return from the central Plains to the
East Coast. However, given surface lee troughing along the central
High Plains, dry downslope flow is expected tomorrow afternoon.
Guidance consensus depicts 15-20 mph sustained southwesterly surface
winds overlapping with 15-20 percent RH for several hours tomorrow
afternoon. Elevated highlights have been added where the
aforementioned meteorological surface conditions may overspread
areas that have received minimal rainfall in the past week, allowing
fine fuels to support some wildfire-spread potential.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1204 PM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorm potential appears low on Monday.

...Synopsis...
An upper low/shortwave trough over the Upper Midwest on Monday
morning will lift northeast across the Great Lakes into southern
Ontario and western Quebec by Tuesday morning. Meanwhile, another
upper shortwave trough over the northern Rockies will develop
eastward to the northern Plains. At the surface, an area of low
pressure will move from Wisconsin to Quebec through the period with
a trailing cold front moving from the Ohio Valley to the
north-central Appalachians and into the Mid-Atlantic. This front
will be more stationary across the Mid-Mississippi Valley and may
start to move north by the end of the period across south-central
Texas.

...Ohio Valley/Lower Great Lakes to the TN/Lower MS
Valleys/Southeast TX...
A narrow corridor of mid 60s dewpoints may be present across the
Ohio Valley on Monday which could result in some weak instability
despite extensive cloud cover and poor lapse rates. Robust vertical
shear could result in a few stronger storms capable of isolated
damaging wind gusts, but the limited instability should keep the
threat minimal overall.

Better-quality boundary layer moisture, slightly better lapse rates,
and the potential for some warming may result in greater instability
farther south, perhaps up to 1000 J/kg MLCAPE. However, vertical
shear will be very weak where this better instability is forecast to
develop. A couple of strong storms will be capable of locally strong
gusts or small hail, but a lack of stronger vertical shear will
likely limit longevity of any stronger/better organized updrafts,
precluding severe probabilities.

...Northern Plains...
Cold temperatures aloft with the upper shortwave trough will support
steep midlevel lapse rates from MT into the northern Plains
vicinity. As weak instability develops across the northern Plains,
scattered thunderstorms are possible. A well-mixed air mass could
support an isolated severe wind threat, particularly across
southwest South Dakota and vicinity where mid-level flow will be
strongest.

Additional thunderstorms may develop overnight across eastern SD
into southern MN/northern IA on the nose of a developing low-level
jet. This activity may produce small hail into early Tuesday
morning.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1157 AM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

Valid 201700Z - 211200Z

...17z Update...
The prior forecast remains on track with only minor changes to the
ongoing fire-weather risk areas for the latest guidance. Across
southern New England, several hours of dry and breezy conditions are
possible behind an offshore cold front. Gusts of 15-20 mph may
overlap with RH below 20% this afternoon. While some wetting rain
has tempered fuels on a scattered basis, enough dry fuels likely
exist for some fire-weather threat.

Across parts of the Dakotas and western MN, several hours of dry
southerly winds are likely ahead of a surface trough. Gusts of 20-30
mph with RH below 30% could support some risk for fire concerns in
dry grasses and fine fuels. However, larger fuels remain less
receptive and some trimming was made on the eastern edge where
wetting rainfall has occurred in the last 72 hours.

..Lyons.. 04/20/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0157 AM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough and corresponding surface low will traverse the
Midwest as another upper trough ejects into the Atlantic from the
Northeast today, encouraging deep-layer offshore flow along the New
England coastline. While the overall synoptic pattern does not favor
widespread, significant wildfire-spread potential across the CONUS,
a few regional concerns for Elevated conditions do exist. 

Somewhat dry southerly return flow over portions of the Northern
Plains may promote 15-20 mph sustained winds amid 25-30 percent RH
this afternoon. Some wildfire-spread potential exists wherever dry
fuel beds are present. Next, dry southeasterly flow will continue
across western parts of the Florida Peninsula, with Elevated
highlights continued across this region given 15 mph wind speeds
coinciding with 25-35 percent RH atop dry fuels by afternoon.
Lastly, 15-20 mph northwesterly surface flow will overlap with 25-40
percent RH across portions of New England by afternoon peak heating.
Given an overall lack of heavy rainfall in this area in the past
week, it is not out of the question for finer fuels to respond
accordingly and support some potential for wildfire spread.

1129 AM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

Valid 201630Z - 211200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
NORTHERN ARKANSAS AND MISSOURI VICINITY...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected today across parts of the ArkLaTex
into the Ozarks and mid Mississippi Valley, mainly this afternoon
and evening. The best corridor for tornadoes (some of which could be
strong) and scattered to numerous damaging winds should exist from
central/northern Arkansas into Missouri.

...Synopsis...
A compact upper low currently moving into western Oklahoma will
shift quickly northeastward this afternoon and tonight, crossing
eastern Kansas and western Missouri this evening and then continuing
northeastward across Iowa and into Wisconsin tonight.  Fast
southwesterly flow aloft will exist in advance of this system,
within the tight height gradient between this feature and the
persistent ridge centered over the Southeast.

At the surface, a developing low analyzed over western Oklahoma at
15Z is forecast to progress northeastward across southeastern Kansas
and Missouri through the afternoon, and then should continue
northward toward -- and eventually into -- southern Wisconsin by
early Monday morning.  While a warm front lifts northward across the
Mid Mississippi Valley/Midwest, a cold front trailing from the low
will sweep eastward into/across Missouri and Arkansas this afternoon
and evening, and then across the Mid and Lower Mississippi Valleys
through the end of the period.

...Northeastern Texas northeastward to the western Illinois
vicinity...
An expansive area of multi-level cloud cover, along with ongoing
convection, is evident across western and northern portions of the
risk area late this morning, which continues to retard more
substantial heating at this point.  With that said, some breaks in
the clouds are evident per recent visible imagery as far west as
eastern Oklahoma, with thinning cloud cover with
eastward/northeastward extent into Arkansas and the Ozarks.

As the surface low over Oklahoma deepens through the day in tandem
with the advance of the upper low, northward advance of the warm
front with time will allow a moist boundary layer to likewise
overspread much of Missouri and Illinois through sunset.  This,
combined with at least modest heating across portions of the area
should yield an amply unstable environment (500 to near 1500 J/kg
mixed-layer CAPE) to gradually evolve -- supporting a steady
increase in convective coverage and intensity this afternoon.

In contrast to the rather modest thermodynamic environment, a very
favorable low-level and deep-layer wind field is evident, with
respect to development of organized/rotating storms.  An 80 kt
mid-level jet will spread northeastward across the risk area with
time, atop a 50-plus kt low-level jet.  This will support vigorous
updraft evolution, with all-hazards severe risk evolving as a
result.  At this time, it remains apparent that tornado potential --
including risk for a couple of strong tornadoes -- should maximize
across the Ozarks, and areas just north and south, as surface winds
back to southeasterly ahead of the deepening/advancing surface low. 
The primary risk should evolve with an anticipated, broken band of
storms within the cold-frontal zone, including embedded supercells.

Along with the tornado potential, fairly widespread coverage of
damaging wind gusts is also expected, as complex, LEWP/bow-type
structures are expected within the band of storms, as convection
advances eastward across Missouri and Arkansas toward the
Mississippi Valley through the afternoon and into the evening hours.
Severe risk is expected to expand as far north as southeastern Iowa
and adjacent western Illinois this evening, where weaker instability
is expected, and as far south as eastern Texas where a weaker wind
field with southward extent should limit severe potential on the
southern fringe.  Risk should very gradually diminish overnight as
convection shifts eastward across the Mid-Mississippi Valley.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PARTS OF
ARKANSAS AND MISSOURI...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are expected today across parts of the ArkLaTex
into the Ozarks and mid Mississippi Valley, mainly this afternoon
and evening. The best corridor for tornadoes (some of which could be
strong) and scattered to numerous damaging winds should exist from
central/northern Arkansas into Missouri.

...ArkLaTex into the Ozarks and Mid Mississippi Valley...
Extensive convection has occurred overnight and early this morning
across the southern Plains into the Ozarks and mid MS Valley.
Ongoing thunderstorms across south-central TX are expected to
continue weakening over the next couple of hours as they encounter a
strongly capped airmass. Activity over eastern OK into western AR
and MO may pose an isolated hail/wind threat this morning, although
instability will tend to remain weak for at least a few more hours.
Otherwise, a strong mid-level shortwave trough will continue to
eject northeastward from the southern Plains across the Ozarks and
mid MS Valley through the period. An attendant 60-90 kt mid-level
jet will likewise spread northeastward across eastern OK/KS and the
Ozarks through the day. A weak surface low over OK this morning will
also develop northeastward to northern MO by this evening, while a
cold front continues moving eastward over the southern Plains
towards the ArkLaTex.

Ongoing cloudiness and precipitation lend some uncertainty regarding
the degree of destabilization that will occur by this afternoon
across the developing warm sector. Still, most guidance shows that
at least low 60s surface dewpoints and related low-level moisture
will attempt to stream northward across eastern OK and AR/MO in
tandem with a strong southerly low-level jet today. Although daytime
heating will likely be hampered to some extent, even 500-1000 J/kg
of MLCAPE will support surface-based thunderstorms by this
afternoon. This destabilization appears likely to occur in a narrow
corridor along and just ahead of the surface low and related cold
front. Rather strong deep-layer shear will easily support organized
updrafts, including the potential for a mix of supercells and broken
line segments.

Current expectations are for robust thunderstorms to develop
along/near the front across eastern OK and vicinity by early
afternoon (17-19Z), as pronounced large-scale ascent associated with
the ejecting shortwave trough impinges on the warm sector. Given a
weakly unstable and strongly sheared environment, this convection
should intensify fairly quickly as it moves east-northeastward into
AR/MO. The linear forcing of the front suggests that a line or
cluster mode should occur, although some high-resolution guidance
does show more of a broken line of supercells given the strength of
the deep-layer shear. Regardless, the threat for scattered to
numerous severe/damaging winds and tornadoes will increase this
afternoon and evening across the Enhanced Risk and vicinity, as a
40-55 kt southerly low-level jet aids in large 0-3 km hodograph
curvature and elongation. Given the forecast strength of the
low-level shear, some of these tornadoes could be strong (EF-2+),
especially if a mixed supercell/cluster mode can be maintained
versus linear. Hail may also occur with any sustained supercells.
The overall severe threat this evening and overnight will be
tempered on the north by limited low-level moisture and instability,
and on the east by gradually increasing MLCIN.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0323 AM CDT Sun Apr 20 2025

Valid 231200Z - 281200Z

...DISCUSSION...
A low-amplitude southwesterly flow regime will prevail for much of
the Day 4-8 period across portions of the central and eastern U.S.,
with a mean upper trough persisting across the western states.
Persistent south/southeasterly low-level flow across the Gulf and
southern Plains will result in northward transport of rich
boundary-layer moisture across the southern and parts of the central
Plains through at least Day 6/Fri. Forecast guidance suggests weak
shortwave impulses may float through modest southwesterly flow Days
4-5/Wed-Thu, perhaps providing some support for isolated to
scattered thunderstorm potential across the warm sector over
TX/OK/KS. Given a moist and unstable airmass, at least some severe
potential will exist. However, where exactly severe potential may
develop Day 4-5/Wed-Thu is uncertain given a lack of stronger
large-scale ascent and absence of any substantial surface
cyclogenesis, coupled with modest deep-layer flow. This precludes 15
percent probabilities at this time, though outlook areas could
become necessary in later outlooks as smaller-scale features become
better resolved.

A period of weak upper ridging may spread across the Plains and the
eastern U.S. on Days 6-7/Fri-Sat ahead of a more substantial upper
trough developing over the western U.S. This may limit severe
potential late in the week before the western upper trough ejects
east toward the end of the forecast period.

Mesoscale Discussion 0484
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0225 PM CDT Sat Apr 19 2025

Areas affected...parts of southern Indiana...northern Kentucky...and
southwestern Ohio

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 191925Z - 192130Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A few stronger storms -- capable producing strong wind
gusts and small hail -- will be possible this afternoon.  WW
issuance is not anticipated at this time.

DISCUSSION...Latest satellite imagery shows that filtered sunshine
-- and associated afternoon heating -- has occurred over the last
couple of hours, but with an increase in cu/cb at this time --
particularly over southern Indiana.  On the western fringe of the
cumuliform cloudiness, radar indicates increasing deep convection
(over far southwestern Indiana) near the cold front, with some
lightning now indicated.

RAP-based objective analysis shows -- aided by the aforementioned
heating -- that mixed-layer CAPE has increased to near/just above
500 J/kg, and with a bit of additional heating destabilization
possible, some increase in convective intensity is expected over the
next couple of hours.

With low-level flow weakly veering, and increasing to 50 kt between
2km and 3km AGL, and in excess of 70 kt at mid levels, shear is
plenty sufficient to aid in convective organization, and associated
potential for strong wind gusts locally.  Though coverage of any
severe-weather reports would likely remain sparse, thus negating any
current consideration for WW issuance, we will continue to monitor
environmental evolution across the area.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 147
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
220 PM CDT Sat Apr 19 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Northwest and Southwest Texas

* Effective this Saturday afternoon and evening from 220 PM until
  1000 PM CDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 3
    inches in diameter likely
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorm coverage is expected to increase in the
vicinity of stationary boundary extended across the region.
Environmental conditions support discrete supercells capable of all
severe hazards, including very large hail up to 3 to 3.5". Several
strong gusts are possible as well. Any supercells that persist
within the warm sector could produce a tornado or two, but the
overall tornado potential is expected to remain low through the
afternoon.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles east and west of a line from 65 miles east of Dryden
TX to 85 miles north northwest of Mineral Wells TX. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU7).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
3 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
24035.

Mesoscale Discussion 0471
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0351 PM CDT Fri Apr 18 2025

Areas affected...parts of cntrl and srn Lower Michigan

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 182051Z - 182245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...The potential for thunderstorm initiation along and just
south of a warm frontal zone across lower Michigan is being
monitored for a possible severe weather watch issuance, as this may
be accompanied by increasing risk for severe hail and wind by 6-8 PM
EDT.

DISCUSSION...A weak perturbation, within larger-scale anticyclonic
flow on the northwestern periphery of prominent mid-level ridging,
will continue to progress across and northeast of the middle
Mississippi Valley through late afternoon.  Associated forcing for
ascent appears to have aided a flare up of convection approaching
the Greater Milwaukee vicinity, and latest Rapid Refresh suggests
that this may contribute to erosion of inhibition associated with
elevated mixed-layer air across southern Lower Michigan by the
22-00Z time frame.  

As this occurs, the moistening boundary-layer along and south of a
warm frontal zone (downstream of a weak surface low migrating across
southern Wisconsin/northern Illinois) may become characterized by
CAPE in excess of 1000 J/kg within the next couple hours, in the
presence of strong deep-layer shear.  Although calibrated HREF and
NCEP SREF guidance indicates highest probabilities for thunderstorm
development evolving above/to the north of the warm frontal zone,
initiation of storms closer to and just south of the frontal zone
will provide the highest potential for organizing and intensifying
into a severe hail and wind threat.

Mesoscale Discussion 0470
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0340 PM CDT Fri Apr 18 2025

Areas affected...north-central Texas and south-central and central
Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 182040Z - 182315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Severe threat to increase through the afternoon and
evening. All hazards possible including large hail, damaging wind,
and tornadoes.

DISCUSSION...Surface analysis indicates a cold front located from
northeastern through the Oklahoma City metro into southwestern
Oklahoma to northwest Texas as of 20z. A dryline was located from
southwestern Oklahoma into southwestern Texas. Ahead of the front, a
broad area of mid to high level cloud cover has been in place across
of southwestern/central Oklahoma, which has limited stronger daytime
heating in this area. Breaks in the clouds have allowed temperatures
to warm into the upper 70s to 80s across eastern Oklahoma. A
gradient of MLCAPE around 500-1500 J/kg extends southwest to
northeast across north-central Texas into eastern Oklahoma with
strong deep layer shear around 55-65 kts.

Recent runs of CAM guidance indicate potential for storm initiation
across north-central Texas into southwestern Oklahoma at the
intersection of the dryline and cold front. Forecast soundings
indicate elongated largely straight hodographs and steep mid-level
lapse rates, indicative of splitting supercells capable of large to
very large (2-3"+) hail. This would support some potential for a
storm or two to move northward to the cool side of the boundary,
where the tornado threat should be minimal. Where the surface based
warm sector resides, downstream  tornado threat may evolve into the
evening as additional development occurs along the cold front and
cells move eastward into more favorable instability and backed
surface winds. A watch or weather watches will be needed in the
coming hours to highlight these potential severe threats.

Mesoscale Discussion 0469
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Fri Apr 18 2025

Areas affected...swrn through much of ern MO...cntrl and nrn IL

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 181953Z - 182230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...The initiation of thunderstorms probably will begin to
increase by 5-7 PM, but this may be slow and rather widely scattered
in nature, resulting in uncertainty concerning severe weather watch
issuance.  Storms that do develop may include supercells with severe
hail, locally strong surface gusts, and at least some risk for a
tornado.

DISCUSSION...Much of the region remains beneath strong, but broadly
anticyclonic mid/upper flow, on the northwestern periphery of
prominent large-scale ridging within a stagnant to slowly
progressive regime.  However, one weak embedded mid-level
perturbation has been slowly shifting into/across the middle
Mississippi Valley vicinity, with associated lift contributing to a
gradual erosion of mid-level inhibition associated with elevated
mixed-layer air across Missouri into Illinois.

This is coinciding with diurnal destabilization of a modestly moist
boundary layer within lee surface troughing across the region. 
Although this has been slowed by broken layers of cloudiness,
mixed-layer CAPE appears on the order of 1000-1500 J/kg, with at
least some further increase through 22-00Z.  At the same time,
low-level hodographs may enlarge beneath southwesterly 850 mb flow
forecast to strengthen to 30-40+ kt.

As the environment becomes conditionally supportive of supercell
development across a sizable area, the focus for and extent of
thunderstorm initiation remains more unclear.  Guidance suggests
that inhibition will become weakest within a relatively narrow
corridor near/just ahead of the cold front now still west of the
Rockford and Quincy IL, Columbia and Joplin MO, vicinities. 
However, better mid/upper forcing for ascent continues to spread
ahead of the front across parts of northern/central Illinois and
east central into south central Missouri.  Currently, it appears
that thunderstorm initiation will be gradual and rather widely
scattered into late afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 0467
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0722 AM CDT Fri Apr 18 2025

Areas affected...Southern Wisconsin...Lake Michigan

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 142...

Valid 181222Z - 181415Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 142
continues.

SUMMARY...A severe threat will likely continue over the next couple
of hours from parts of southern Wisconsin eastward over Lake
Michigan. Significant wind gusts and large hail will be possible
with the strongest of cells.

DISCUSSION...The latest high-resolution radar imagery from KMKX
shows a cluster of strong to severe storms over southern Wisconsin,
with a severe short line segment located about 40 statute miles to
the west of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The storms are located along an
east-to-west gradient of instability, where the RAP is estimating
MUCAPE around 1000 J/kg. RAP forecast soundings to the west of
Milwaukee still have a temperature inversion from the surface to 850
mb, with strong effective shear above the inversion. This will
continue to support elevated supercell development. In addition,
forecast soundings have steep lapse rates in the 700 to 500 mb
layer, which will aid a threat for large hail with supercells.
Hailstones greater than 2 inches in diameter will be possible in the
more intense cores. The stronger and faster moving line segments
could also produce severe gusts, with 70+ mph gusts possible. The
severe threat is expected to become more isolated later this
morning. To the east of the current watch, watch issuance probably
won't be needed. Trends will be monitored.

Mesoscale Discussion 0459
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Thu Apr 17 2025

Areas affected...parts of ern NE into wrn IA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 171953Z - 172200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...The initiation of strong to severe thunderstorms,
including supercells posing a risk for large, potentially damaging,
hail may increase by 5-7 PM CDT, if not a bit earlier.  It is
possible that the potential for a tornado or two could increase
near/north and east of the Greater Omaha area later this evening.

DISCUSSION...Trailing the surface low, which is now migrating north
of the Redwood Falls MN vicinity, a surface cold front is
maintaining a southward advancement into/across the Sioux
Falls/Sioux City areas, Norfolk NE and the Grand
Island/Kearney/Hasting NE vicinities.  Substantive boundary-layer
warming and moistening (including surface dew points near 60F)
continues in a narrow corridor ahead of this feature, where
mixed-layer CAPE may continue to increase up to around 2000 J/kg
within the next few hours, beneath a warm and capping elevated
mixed-layer area.

Models continue to suggest that mid-level forcing for ascent
associated with a weak short wave perturbation may increasingly
contribute to subtle mid-level height falls and erosion of the
lower/mid-tropospheric inhibition as far south as the Lincoln and
Omaha NE vicinities by 22-00Z.  As this occurs, potential for the
initiation of thunderstorm activity will increase, both along and
ahead of the cold front.  Although there may be a tendency for
convection to become undercut by the front, convection allowing
model output suggests that forcing associated with pre-frontal warm
advection may maintain at least one or two sustained storms,
propagating to the right of the 30-40 kt west-southwesterly mean
flow.

As long as this occurs, it appears that the environment may become
conducive to supercells capable of produce swaths of large hail, at
least occasionally in excess of 2 inches in diameter.  Low-level
flow and shear are initially weak, but strengthening toward early
evening might result in an increase in potential for a tornado
near/north and east of Greater Omaha.

Mesoscale Discussion 0454
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0349 PM CDT Wed Apr 16 2025

Areas affected...parts of swrn into s cntrl KS

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 162049Z - 162315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...An isolated supercell or two may evolve from initially
high-based thunderstorm development by 6-7 PM CDT, posing primarily
a risk for severe hail and locally strong surface gusts.

DISCUSSION...As boundary-layer heating and mixing continues,
deepening high-based convective development is ongoing in a corridor
near/north of the Raton Mesa vicinity into southwestern Kansas. 
This appears focused downstream of a weak mid-level perturbation,
which is progressing toward the crest of large-scale mid-level
ridging across the southern Rockies through southern Great Plains. 
With continuing insolation, this convective development is likely to
persist and gradually spread northeastward and eastward with the
supporting large-scale forcing for ascent.  

Strongest boundary-layer heating appears focused northwest of the
Dalhart TX toward Dodge City KS vicinity, where surface dew points
remain in the upper 30s to lower 40s F.  However, more substantive
moistening is ongoing farther east, including a corridor across the
Medicine Lodge toward Great Bend KS vicinities, where dew points may
continue to increase into and through the lower mid 50s F, as
southerly low-level flow strengthens through 23-00Z.  It appears
that this may contribute mixed-layer CAPE increasing to the order of
1000 J/kg.

In the presence of lower/mid-tropospheric warm advection, the
boundary-layer destabilization may largely remain suppressed by
warming, elevated mixed-layer air.  However, the eventual
intensification of initially high-based convection overspreading the
region appears at least possible later this afternoon, particularly
near/east of the Dodge City vicinity, aided by inflow of the
potentially more unstable air.  If this becomes sustained, shear
beneath moderate to strong westerly mid/upper flow appears more than
sufficient to support the evolution an isolated boundary-layer based
supercell or two, primarily posing a risk for severe hail and
locally strong surface gusts.

Mesoscale Discussion 0447
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0110 PM CDT Mon Apr 14 2025

Areas affected...parts of cntrl/sern SD...swrn MN...nern IA...nern
NE

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 141810Z - 142115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Showers spreading southeastward through the mid Missouri
Valley may begin to intensify by 3-4 PM CDT, with a few weak
thunderstorms developing and posing increasing potential for strong
to severe surface gusts while spreading southeastward through the
remainder of the afternoon.

DISCUSSION...In the wake of a deep cyclone, now migrating northeast
of the Upper Great Lakes region, downward mixing of momentum is
already contributing to 30-35+ kt northwesterly surface gusts across
much of the middle Missouri Valley, as boundary-layer warming
progresses.  This is occurring just ahead of a vigorous short wave
trough now digging through the western Dakotas, and forecast to
continue rapidly southeastward through early evening.  

Models indicate that the mid-level cold core (including -30 to -35C
around 500 mb) will overspread a corridor from central South Dakota
through northeastern Iowa between 20-23Z, coincident with further
strengthening of northwesterly flow (35-40+ kt) in the 850-700 mb
layer and peak afternoon surface heating.  As this occurs, forecast
soundings indicate that profiles will become increasingly conducive
to deepening convection capable of producing lightning. 

With at least some further intensification of ongoing developing
convection, evaporative cooling and melting of precipitation within
an increasing well-mixed boundary layer (characterized by sizable
surface temperature/dew point spreads on the order of 20+ F),
coupled with the downward mixing of stronger flow aloft, seems
likely to contribute to increasing potential for surface gusts
approaching or briefly exceeding severe limits.  This may continue
into early evening, as convection spreads southeastward, before
rapidly diminishing with the onset of boundary-layer cooling.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 138
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
325 PM EDT Mon Apr 14 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central and Eastern Kentucky
  Southern Ohio
  Far Southwestern Pennsylvania
  Southwestern Virginia
  West Virginia

* Effective this Monday afternoon and evening from 325 PM until
  1100 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms coverage is expected to increase over the
next few hours along and ahead of a cold front pushing eastward
across the region. Environmental conditions support strong to severe
storms. An initially cellular mode will favor large hail and
damaging gusts before a transition to a more linear storm mode
favors primarily damaging gusts.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles north and south of a line from 30 miles west of
Lexington KY to 60 miles north northeast of White Sulphur Springs
WV. For a complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch
outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
24040.

...Mosier
