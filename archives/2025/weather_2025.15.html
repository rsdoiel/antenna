Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0358 AM CDT Tue Apr 15 2025

Valid 181200Z - 231200Z

...DISCUSSION...
An active severe weather pattern expected through at least this
weekend, before predictability diminishes early next week.

...D4/Friday...
Guidance remains consistent with a broad swath of strong mid-level
southwesterlies from the southern High Plains to the Great Lakes,
downstream of a longwave trough from northern ON to the Lower CO
Valley. This will overlap a similarly oriented surface front. In
response to increasing mid-level height falls, a surface cyclone
should track across the central Great Lakes portion of the
baroclinic zone during the day. Afternoon severe may be focused in
this region with stronger low-level shear. Parts of this region may
warrant higher probabilities in later outlooks.

Farther southwest, a pronounced EML may delay the bulk of storm
development along the front until evening. But given the strong
deep-layer shear and moderate buoyancy, scattered severe storms
appear possible. 

...D5/Saturday...
Amplification of an embedded northern-stream shortwave impulse over
ON/QC should sustain an expansive swath of strong mid-level flow
from the OH Valley northeastward. The northeast extent of
appreciable instability overlapping with this regime becomes
nebulous east of the Appalachians, but scattered severe storms seem
possible from the Cumberland Plateau into the Mid-South on Saturday
afternoon to evening.

Over the southern Great Plains, lingering convection Saturday
morning renders uncertainty along the largely stalling baroclinic
zone that will undoubtedly be modified by convective outflow. But
with greater consistency in guidance handling the pivot of the basal
shortwave impulse across the Southwest, multiple rounds of strong to
severe convection are plausible through Saturday night. 

...D6/Sunday...
Predictability lessens by this period with the evolution of compact
shortwave trough ejecting onto the southern Great Plains. This
yields substantial spread in the attendant synoptic cyclone. In
addition, potentially extensive ongoing convection Sunday morning
further lessens confidence in mesoscale details. But a belt of
potentially very strong mid-level southwesterlies overlapping rich
western Gulf moisture supports inclusion of a severe-area highlight
in the South-Central States.

Mesoscale Discussion 0447
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0110 PM CDT Mon Apr 14 2025

Areas affected...parts of cntrl/sern SD...swrn MN...nern IA...nern
NE

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 141810Z - 142115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Showers spreading southeastward through the mid Missouri
Valley may begin to intensify by 3-4 PM CDT, with a few weak
thunderstorms developing and posing increasing potential for strong
to severe surface gusts while spreading southeastward through the
remainder of the afternoon.

DISCUSSION...In the wake of a deep cyclone, now migrating northeast
of the Upper Great Lakes region, downward mixing of momentum is
already contributing to 30-35+ kt northwesterly surface gusts across
much of the middle Missouri Valley, as boundary-layer warming
progresses.  This is occurring just ahead of a vigorous short wave
trough now digging through the western Dakotas, and forecast to
continue rapidly southeastward through early evening.  

Models indicate that the mid-level cold core (including -30 to -35C
around 500 mb) will overspread a corridor from central South Dakota
through northeastern Iowa between 20-23Z, coincident with further
strengthening of northwesterly flow (35-40+ kt) in the 850-700 mb
layer and peak afternoon surface heating.  As this occurs, forecast
soundings indicate that profiles will become increasingly conducive
to deepening convection capable of producing lightning. 

With at least some further intensification of ongoing developing
convection, evaporative cooling and melting of precipitation within
an increasing well-mixed boundary layer (characterized by sizable
surface temperature/dew point spreads on the order of 20+ F),
coupled with the downward mixing of stronger flow aloft, seems
likely to contribute to increasing potential for surface gusts
approaching or briefly exceeding severe limits.  This may continue
into early evening, as convection spreads southeastward, before
rapidly diminishing with the onset of boundary-layer cooling.

Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0249 PM CDT Mon Apr 14 2025

Valid 142000Z - 151200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS WEST
VIRGINIA AND VIRGINIA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe storms ongoing this afternoon will
continue through early tonight from the Upper Ohio Valley eastward
to the Mid-Atlantic. Large hail, severe wind gusts, and a couple of
tornadoes are likely.

...20z Update OH Valley and Appalachians...
Afternoon satellite imagery shows several areas of convection
developing beneath a broad upper low over parts of the Midwest,
Great Lakes and Ohio Valley. Initial storms across IN/OH/KY will
continue to mature as the cold front moves east. Upper 50s to low
60s F dewpoints and steep mid-level lapse rates beneath the upper
low will support around 1000 J/kg of MLCAPE. 40-50 kt of effective
shear, but veered low-level flow will support a mix of supercells
and linear clusters. Hail and damaging winds appear likely, along
with a risk for a couple tornadoes. Storms will spread east into the
Mid Atlantic this evening, mainly with a risk for damaging gusts.
Minimal changes were made to the outlook area on the western edge to
capture storm development farther west along the front.

...Midwest...
Near the core of a secondary vort max over the northern Plains,
broad-scale ascent was supporting scattered low-topped convection
across parts of SD, NE, and northwestern IA. Strong mid-level flow
will continue to move south as a mid-level jet intensifies. Despite
the limited surface moisture, the relatively cold mid-level
temperatures and strong ascent will favor some threat for small hail
and damaging gusts with shallow storms. Have adjusted the Marginal
southward across central IA where weak buoyancy (MUCAPE 200-300
J/kg) may allow storms with damaging gust potential to persist
farther south this evening.

..Lyons.. 04/14/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1130 AM CDT Mon Apr 14 2025/

...Upper OH Valley this afternoon into VA early tonight...
Recent satellite imagery depicts a maturing mid-latitude cyclone
moving eastward across Lake Superior towards northeastern Ontario
with an upstream shortwave trough moving through the northern
Plains. Expectation is for the cyclone to continue
deepening/maturing as it moves into and through northeastern Ontario
today, while the upstream shortwave progresses quickly southeastward
through the Mid MO Valley and into the Mid MS Valley. As this
occurs, strong mid-level flow will spread eastward across the OH
Valley and over the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic States. 

At the same time, a cold front will spread eastward across the OH
Valley this afternoon and evening, and across the central
Appalachians tonight. Current surface analysis reveals upper 40s to
low 50s dewpoints ahead of the front in the Middle OH Valley, with
the upper 50s/low 60s dewpoints farther southwest over western KY.
This greater low-level moisture is expected to surge northeastward
amid the moderate southwesterly low-level flow, combining with
evapotranspiration to bring upper 50s dewpoints into upper OH Valley
ahead of the front. 

This increase in low-level moisture combined with daytime heating
should be enough to destabilize the airmass ahead of the front
across the Upper OH Valley. Forcing for ascent (from a combination
of increasing large-scale ascent and forcing along the front) will
increase across this destabilized area, supporting thunderstorm
development during the afternoon. An initially cellular mode is
anticipated, with steep mid-level lapse rates and long hodographs
potentially resulting in a few supercells. Primary severe risk with
these supercells is large hail of 1-2 inches in diameter. Some
damaging gusts and a tornado or two are possible, although the lack
of higher low-level moisture will mitigate the overall tornado
potential. Strong outflow and increasing mid-level flow suggest a
transition to a more linear mode is likely, with several bowing
segments possible. There is also some potential for the development
of a singular, more coherent convective line. In either case, a
transition from hail to damaging gusts as the primary severe risk is
anticipated as this activity spreads eastward. Clusters/line
segments will likely persist east of the Appalachians into VA
through early tonight, though the severe threat will diminish with
eastward extent and after 03z. 

...SD to IA this afternoon/evening...
Low-level moisture will be limited, but surface heating beneath
cooling midlevel temperatures will support weak surface-based
buoyancy and the potential for low-topped showers and a few
thunderstorms from SD into IA (in advance of a digging shortwave
trough now over western ND/eastern MT). Relatively cold temperature
profiles will favor some threat for small hail, while steep
low-level lapse rates and 30+ kt flow through the mixed layer favor
gusty outflow winds of 40-50 mph.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0233 PM CDT Mon Apr 14 2025

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

Latest model guidance consensus reveals a higher confidence in
eastern extent of Elevated fire weather concerns over portions of
the Desert Southwest as an upper-level short wave pushes through the
region tomorrow. Expected southwest winds of 15-20 mph combined with
a dry boundary layer to promote Elevated fire weather conditions
across southeastern Arizona into southwestern and central New
Mexico. Isolated showers and a few thunderstorms with limited
surface precipitation are expected across the Four Corners area. A
very dry sub-cloud layer could result in gusty surface winds from
virga, but a significant dry lightning event is not expected in the
marginal convective environment.

..Williams/Moore.. 04/14/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0138 AM CDT Mon Apr 14 2025/

...Synopsis...
A surface high will push into the southern Rockies on Tuesday. A
weakening shortwave trough will move through parts of the Southwest.
Farther east, a strong upper trough will move through the East Coast
through the day. A cold front will move offshore early afternoon
with gusty northwest wind filling in behind it.

...Southwest...
How far the cooler air pushes westward will determine the exact
extent of fire weather risk in the vicinity of the Arizona/New
Mexico border. Current guidance would suggest a primarily upslope
regime into central Mexico with cooler temperatures and higher RH.
West of this cooler air, the upper shortwave trough will be
favorably timed during the afternoon. Dry and breezy conditions will
lead to elevated fire weather. Surface winds of 15-20 mph and RH of
15-20% will be possible.

...Piedmont/Blue Ridge...
RH of 20-25% is possible in the wake of the cold front where modest
downslope winds off of the Appalachians will occur. Winds will
potentially reach 15-20 mph. Despite these conditions, recent
rainfall has likely tempered fuel receptiveness. No highlights will
be added at this time.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 138
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
325 PM EDT Mon Apr 14 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central and Eastern Kentucky
  Southern Ohio
  Far Southwestern Pennsylvania
  Southwestern Virginia
  West Virginia

* Effective this Monday afternoon and evening from 325 PM until
  1100 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms coverage is expected to increase over the
next few hours along and ahead of a cold front pushing eastward
across the region. Environmental conditions support strong to severe
storms. An initially cellular mode will favor large hail and
damaging gusts before a transition to a more linear storm mode
favors primarily damaging gusts.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles north and south of a line from 30 miles west of
Lexington KY to 60 miles north northeast of White Sulphur Springs
WV. For a complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch
outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
24040.

Day 3 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0220 PM CDT Mon Apr 14 2025

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not forecast through Wednesday night.

...Synopsis...
A broad area of isolated to scattered thunderstorms are expected
across portions of the West into the northern Rockies and central
Plains. This is in response to forcing for ascent increasing with a
broad area of enhanced mid-level flow rounding the western US
trough. Largely, thunderstorms will be disorganized and sub-severe,
owing to poor moisture and weak shear profiles. 

...Central Plains...
Large scale ascent will lead to potential for initial isolated to
scattered thunderstorm development across portions of the central
Plains Wednesday afternoon. This will remain sub-severe given
marginal moisture profiles and presence of a strong EML. 

As west to southwesterly mid-level flow overspreads the Rockies, lee
cyclogenesis is expected to occur Wednesday evening. This will
result in mass response with an increase in the southerly low-level
jet across the southern/central Plains by late evening into the
early morning Thursday. Return of more appreciable moisture will
spread into portions of eastern Kansas. Convective potential will be
tempered by a strong EML and better forcing remaining to the north
of this region. However, should elevated thunderstorm development
occur, some conditional risk for large hail would be possible. Given
uncertainty in convective initiation, no areas were included with
this outlook.

...NO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AREAS FORECAST...

...SUMMARY...
Severe thunderstorms are not expected on Tuesday or Tuesday night.

...Northeast...
A post-frontal regime will be in place across the Northeast Tuesday.
Flow aloft will remain modest with mid-level cooling through the
day. This will support potential for redevelopment of scattered
thunderstorm activity by the afternoon. Given post-frontal drying
conditions and weak buoyancy, this should yield primarily sub-severe
low-topped convection, though occasional gusty winds will be
possible. 

...Southwest...
A mid-level low will approach the West Coast, with a belt of
mid-level flow overspreading southern California into southern
Nevada. Ahead of this feature, a weak shortwave trough will move
across the Lower Colorado Valley towards the southern Rockies.
Enough mid-level moisture in place with large-scale ascent will
allow for isolated to scattered thunderstorm activity across the
northern Sierra and across the Four Corners region. As shear
profiles will be weak, storms are not expected to be severe.

Valid 141700Z - 151200Z

Ongoing elevated surface winds from the northwest of 15-25 mph
within a dry post-frontal air mass will still result in Elevated
fire weather conditions for parts of Central Plains today. Localized
Critical fire weather conditions could develop where cloud cover
remains minimal across central Nebraska as relative humidity drops
into the 15-20% range this afternoon. However, a widespread Critical
fire weather threat is not expected.

..Williams/Moore.. 04/14/2025

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0137 AM CDT Mon Apr 14 2025/

...Synopsis...
Strong surface winds are expected in the wake of a cold front across
the northern/central Plains today. These strong winds will persist
into at least early afternoon. Thereafter, winds will steadily
diminish. Despite a tendency for cooler temperatures to filter into
the region, modest downslope flow and surface heating should allow
temperatures to remain in the 50s/low 60s F. RH values of 20-30% are
probable. Winds of 15-25 mph are expected. The most favorable
overlap of these conditions are expected in parts of far southwest
South Dakota, Nebraska, and far northern Kansas. Elevated to locally
critical fire weather conditions will occur for a few hours this
afternoon. Models have quite a bit variance in the location and
duration of sustained critical conditions. This is likely due to
uncertainties in low/mid-level clouds that will eventually move into
Nebraska. This precludes the addition of the critical highlight at
this time.

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS WEST
VIRGINIA AND NORTHWEST VIRGINIA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe storms are expected this afternoon
through early tonight from the Upper Ohio Valley eastward to the
Mid-Atlantic. Large hail, severe wind gusts, and a couple of
tornadoes will be possible.

...Upper OH Valley this afternoon into VA early tonight...
Recent satellite imagery depicts a maturing mid-latitude cyclone
moving eastward across Lake Superior towards northeastern Ontario
with an upstream shortwave trough moving through the northern
Plains. Expectation is for the cyclone to continue
deepening/maturing as it moves into and through northeastern Ontario
today, while the upstream shortwave progresses quickly southeastward
through the Mid MO Valley and into the Mid MS Valley. As this
occurs, strong mid-level flow will spread eastward across the OH
Valley and over the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic States. 

At the same time, a cold front will spread eastward across the OH
Valley this afternoon and evening, and across the central
Appalachians tonight. Current surface analysis reveals upper 40s to
low 50s dewpoints ahead of the front in the Middle OH Valley, with
the upper 50s/low 60s dewpoints farther southwest over western KY.
This greater low-level moisture is expected to surge northeastward
amid the moderate southwesterly low-level flow, combining with
evapotranspiration to bring upper 50s dewpoints into upper OH Valley
ahead of the front. 

This increase in low-level moisture combined with daytime heating
should be enough to destabilize the airmass ahead of the front
across the Upper OH Valley. Forcing for ascent (from a combination
of increasing large-scale ascent and forcing along the front) will
increase across this destabilized area, supporting thunderstorm
development during the afternoon. An initially cellular mode is
anticipated, with steep mid-level lapse rates and long hodographs
potentially resulting in a few supercells. Primary severe risk with
these supercells is large hail of 1-2 inches in diameter. Some
damaging gusts and a tornado or two are possible, although the lack
of higher low-level moisture will mitigate the overall tornado
potential. Strong outflow and increasing mid-level flow suggest a
transition to a more linear mode is likely, with several bowing
segments possible. There is also some potential for the development
of a singular, more coherent convective line. In either case, a
transition from hail to damaging gusts as the primary severe risk is
anticipated as this activity spreads eastward. Clusters/line
segments will likely persist east of the Appalachians into VA
through early tonight, though the severe threat will diminish with
eastward extent and after 03z. 

...SD to IA this afternoon/evening...
Low-level moisture will be limited, but surface heating beneath
cooling midlevel temperatures will support weak surface-based
buoyancy and the potential for low-topped showers and a few
thunderstorms from SD into IA (in advance of a digging shortwave
trough now over western ND/eastern MT). Relatively cold temperature
profiles will favor some threat for small hail, while steep
low-level lapse rates and 30+ kt flow through the mixed layer favor
gusty outflow winds of 40-50 mph.

...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON
INTO EARLY TONIGHT FROM EASTERN KENTUCKY ACROSS WEST VIRGINIA INTO
CENTRAL VIRGINIA...

...SUMMARY...
Scattered strong to severe storms are expected this afternoon
through early tonight from the Upper Ohio Valley eastward to the
Mid-Atlantic. Large hail, severe wind gusts, and a couple of
tornadoes will be possible.

...Upper OH Valley this afternoon into VA early tonight...
An initial shortwave trough and surface cyclone will occlude by
tonight between Lake Superior and James Bay, as an upstream
shortwave trough digs southeastward from the northern Plains toward
the OH Valley.  An associated surface cold front will move
southeastward across the OH Valley today, while a corridor of
moisture return occurs ahead of the front from the Mid-South to WV. 
Surface heating in cloud breaks will drive temperatures into the 70s
by early-mid afternoon, coincident with northeastward advection of
55-60 F boundary-layer dewpoints beneath the northeastward extent of
an elevated mixed layer.  Though the upstream moisture source is
rather modest by mid April standards, recent green up and unusually
moist ground across the OH Valley will augment evapotranspiration. 
These processes will result in MLCAPE of 1000-1500 J/kg with minimal
convective inhibition as low-level ascent focuses along the front.

Thunderstorm development is expected by mid afternoon in a broken
band along the cold front from northern KY into southern OH, and
storms subsequently expand in coverage while spreading
east-southeastward across WV into VA through early tonight.  The
moderate buoyancy and long hodographs will support supercells
capable of producing large hail of 1-2 inches in diameter, and
damaging winds of 60-75 mph are also expected, especially with any
upscale growth into bowing segments.  Low-level shear/hodograph
curvature will be sufficient for some tornado threat, though this
will be modulated by the degree of low-level moistening. 
Clusters/line segments will persist east of the Appalachians into VA
through early tonight, though the severe threat will diminish with
eastward extent and after 03z. 

...SD to IA this afternoon/evening...
Despite limited low-level moisture, surface heating beneath cooling
midlevel temperatures will support weak surface-based buoyancy and
the potential for low-topped thunderstorms from SD into IA (in
advance of the digging shortwave trough now over western ND/eastern
MT).  Relatively cold temperature profiles will favor some threat
for small hail, while steep low-level lapse rates and 30+ kt flow
through the mixed layer favor gusty outflow winds of 40-50 mph.
