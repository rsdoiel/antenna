Mesoscale Discussion 0471
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0351 PM CDT Fri Apr 18 2025

Areas affected...parts of cntrl and srn Lower Michigan

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 182051Z - 182245Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...The potential for thunderstorm initiation along and just
south of a warm frontal zone across lower Michigan is being
monitored for a possible severe weather watch issuance, as this may
be accompanied by increasing risk for severe hail and wind by 6-8 PM
EDT.

DISCUSSION...A weak perturbation, within larger-scale anticyclonic
flow on the northwestern periphery of prominent mid-level ridging,
will continue to progress across and northeast of the middle
Mississippi Valley through late afternoon.  Associated forcing for
ascent appears to have aided a flare up of convection approaching
the Greater Milwaukee vicinity, and latest Rapid Refresh suggests
that this may contribute to erosion of inhibition associated with
elevated mixed-layer air across southern Lower Michigan by the
22-00Z time frame.  

As this occurs, the moistening boundary-layer along and south of a
warm frontal zone (downstream of a weak surface low migrating across
southern Wisconsin/northern Illinois) may become characterized by
CAPE in excess of 1000 J/kg within the next couple hours, in the
presence of strong deep-layer shear.  Although calibrated HREF and
NCEP SREF guidance indicates highest probabilities for thunderstorm
development evolving above/to the north of the warm frontal zone,
initiation of storms closer to and just south of the frontal zone
will provide the highest potential for organizing and intensifying
into a severe hail and wind threat.

Mesoscale Discussion 0470
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0340 PM CDT Fri Apr 18 2025

Areas affected...north-central Texas and south-central and central
Oklahoma

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 182040Z - 182315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...Severe threat to increase through the afternoon and
evening. All hazards possible including large hail, damaging wind,
and tornadoes.

DISCUSSION...Surface analysis indicates a cold front located from
northeastern through the Oklahoma City metro into southwestern
Oklahoma to northwest Texas as of 20z. A dryline was located from
southwestern Oklahoma into southwestern Texas. Ahead of the front, a
broad area of mid to high level cloud cover has been in place across
of southwestern/central Oklahoma, which has limited stronger daytime
heating in this area. Breaks in the clouds have allowed temperatures
to warm into the upper 70s to 80s across eastern Oklahoma. A
gradient of MLCAPE around 500-1500 J/kg extends southwest to
northeast across north-central Texas into eastern Oklahoma with
strong deep layer shear around 55-65 kts.

Recent runs of CAM guidance indicate potential for storm initiation
across north-central Texas into southwestern Oklahoma at the
intersection of the dryline and cold front. Forecast soundings
indicate elongated largely straight hodographs and steep mid-level
lapse rates, indicative of splitting supercells capable of large to
very large (2-3"+) hail. This would support some potential for a
storm or two to move northward to the cool side of the boundary,
where the tornado threat should be minimal. Where the surface based
warm sector resides, downstream  tornado threat may evolve into the
evening as additional development occurs along the cold front and
cells move eastward into more favorable instability and backed
surface winds. A watch or weather watches will be needed in the
coming hours to highlight these potential severe threats.

Mesoscale Discussion 0469
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Fri Apr 18 2025

Areas affected...swrn through much of ern MO...cntrl and nrn IL

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch possible 

Valid 181953Z - 182230Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...40 percent

SUMMARY...The initiation of thunderstorms probably will begin to
increase by 5-7 PM, but this may be slow and rather widely scattered
in nature, resulting in uncertainty concerning severe weather watch
issuance.  Storms that do develop may include supercells with severe
hail, locally strong surface gusts, and at least some risk for a
tornado.

DISCUSSION...Much of the region remains beneath strong, but broadly
anticyclonic mid/upper flow, on the northwestern periphery of
prominent large-scale ridging within a stagnant to slowly
progressive regime.  However, one weak embedded mid-level
perturbation has been slowly shifting into/across the middle
Mississippi Valley vicinity, with associated lift contributing to a
gradual erosion of mid-level inhibition associated with elevated
mixed-layer air across Missouri into Illinois.

This is coinciding with diurnal destabilization of a modestly moist
boundary layer within lee surface troughing across the region. 
Although this has been slowed by broken layers of cloudiness,
mixed-layer CAPE appears on the order of 1000-1500 J/kg, with at
least some further increase through 22-00Z.  At the same time,
low-level hodographs may enlarge beneath southwesterly 850 mb flow
forecast to strengthen to 30-40+ kt.

As the environment becomes conditionally supportive of supercell
development across a sizable area, the focus for and extent of
thunderstorm initiation remains more unclear.  Guidance suggests
that inhibition will become weakest within a relatively narrow
corridor near/just ahead of the cold front now still west of the
Rockford and Quincy IL, Columbia and Joplin MO, vicinities. 
However, better mid/upper forcing for ascent continues to spread
ahead of the front across parts of northern/central Illinois and
east central into south central Missouri.  Currently, it appears
that thunderstorm initiation will be gradual and rather widely
scattered into late afternoon.

Mesoscale Discussion 0467
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0722 AM CDT Fri Apr 18 2025

Areas affected...Southern Wisconsin...Lake Michigan

Concerning...Severe Thunderstorm Watch 142...

Valid 181222Z - 181415Z

The severe weather threat for Severe Thunderstorm Watch 142
continues.

SUMMARY...A severe threat will likely continue over the next couple
of hours from parts of southern Wisconsin eastward over Lake
Michigan. Significant wind gusts and large hail will be possible
with the strongest of cells.

DISCUSSION...The latest high-resolution radar imagery from KMKX
shows a cluster of strong to severe storms over southern Wisconsin,
with a severe short line segment located about 40 statute miles to
the west of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The storms are located along an
east-to-west gradient of instability, where the RAP is estimating
MUCAPE around 1000 J/kg. RAP forecast soundings to the west of
Milwaukee still have a temperature inversion from the surface to 850
mb, with strong effective shear above the inversion. This will
continue to support elevated supercell development. In addition,
forecast soundings have steep lapse rates in the 700 to 500 mb
layer, which will aid a threat for large hail with supercells.
Hailstones greater than 2 inches in diameter will be possible in the
more intense cores. The stronger and faster moving line segments
could also produce severe gusts, with 70+ mph gusts possible. The
severe threat is expected to become more isolated later this
morning. To the east of the current watch, watch issuance probably
won't be needed. Trends will be monitored.

Mesoscale Discussion 0459
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Thu Apr 17 2025

Areas affected...parts of ern NE into wrn IA

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 171953Z - 172200Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...The initiation of strong to severe thunderstorms,
including supercells posing a risk for large, potentially damaging,
hail may increase by 5-7 PM CDT, if not a bit earlier.  It is
possible that the potential for a tornado or two could increase
near/north and east of the Greater Omaha area later this evening.

DISCUSSION...Trailing the surface low, which is now migrating north
of the Redwood Falls MN vicinity, a surface cold front is
maintaining a southward advancement into/across the Sioux
Falls/Sioux City areas, Norfolk NE and the Grand
Island/Kearney/Hasting NE vicinities.  Substantive boundary-layer
warming and moistening (including surface dew points near 60F)
continues in a narrow corridor ahead of this feature, where
mixed-layer CAPE may continue to increase up to around 2000 J/kg
within the next few hours, beneath a warm and capping elevated
mixed-layer area.

Models continue to suggest that mid-level forcing for ascent
associated with a weak short wave perturbation may increasingly
contribute to subtle mid-level height falls and erosion of the
lower/mid-tropospheric inhibition as far south as the Lincoln and
Omaha NE vicinities by 22-00Z.  As this occurs, potential for the
initiation of thunderstorm activity will increase, both along and
ahead of the cold front.  Although there may be a tendency for
convection to become undercut by the front, convection allowing
model output suggests that forcing associated with pre-frontal warm
advection may maintain at least one or two sustained storms,
propagating to the right of the 30-40 kt west-southwesterly mean
flow.

As long as this occurs, it appears that the environment may become
conducive to supercells capable of produce swaths of large hail, at
least occasionally in excess of 2 inches in diameter.  Low-level
flow and shear are initially weak, but strengthening toward early
evening might result in an increase in potential for a tornado
near/north and east of Greater Omaha.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0330 AM CDT Thu Apr 17 2025

Valid 201200Z - 251200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Day 4/Sun - ArkLaTex to the Mid-MS Valley...

A compact upper shortwave trough is forecast to move from the
southern High Plains to the Midwest on Sunday. While some forecast
uncertainty continues with regard to exact position of this feature,
the overall pattern suggests isolated to scattered severe
thunderstorm potential will exist across portions of east TX into
the Mid/Lower MS Valley. 

Strong southwesterly flow aloft will overspread a moist warm sector
as a surface low lifts north/northeast from OK into the Lower MO
Valley through early evening. A trailing cold front will spread east
as this occurs, while a warm front extends eastward from the Mid-MS
Valley into the OH Valley. Evolution of prior days convection is
resulting in some uncertainty regarding the western/northern extent
of severe potential. Nevertheless, a favorable environment
supporting at least isolated severe storms should extend from east
TX into parts of southern MO/IL ahead of the cold front.

...Days 5-8/Mon-Thu...

Forecast ensemble guidance from both the GEFS and EPS suggest
low-amplitude west/southwesterly flow will overspread the southern
tier of the U.S. next week. Southerly low-level flow on Day 5/Mon
across the western Gulf into the southern Plains in the wake of the
cold frontal passage on Day 4/Sun will allow for northward transport
of modified moisture. This should continue into Day 6/Tue across the
Plains. Some localized severe risk could develop across parts of the
southern Plains as an upper shortwave trough moves across the
north-central U.S. on Day 6/Tue, but poor juxtaposition between
higher quality moisture across OK/TX and stronger forcing across the
northern Plains/Upper Midwest may limit overall potential. This
low-amplitude pattern will continue through Day 8, resulting in low
predictability.

Mesoscale Discussion 0454
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0349 PM CDT Wed Apr 16 2025

Areas affected...parts of swrn into s cntrl KS

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 162049Z - 162315Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...An isolated supercell or two may evolve from initially
high-based thunderstorm development by 6-7 PM CDT, posing primarily
a risk for severe hail and locally strong surface gusts.

DISCUSSION...As boundary-layer heating and mixing continues,
deepening high-based convective development is ongoing in a corridor
near/north of the Raton Mesa vicinity into southwestern Kansas. 
This appears focused downstream of a weak mid-level perturbation,
which is progressing toward the crest of large-scale mid-level
ridging across the southern Rockies through southern Great Plains. 
With continuing insolation, this convective development is likely to
persist and gradually spread northeastward and eastward with the
supporting large-scale forcing for ascent.  

Strongest boundary-layer heating appears focused northwest of the
Dalhart TX toward Dodge City KS vicinity, where surface dew points
remain in the upper 30s to lower 40s F.  However, more substantive
moistening is ongoing farther east, including a corridor across the
Medicine Lodge toward Great Bend KS vicinities, where dew points may
continue to increase into and through the lower mid 50s F, as
southerly low-level flow strengthens through 23-00Z.  It appears
that this may contribute mixed-layer CAPE increasing to the order of
1000 J/kg.

In the presence of lower/mid-tropospheric warm advection, the
boundary-layer destabilization may largely remain suppressed by
warming, elevated mixed-layer air.  However, the eventual
intensification of initially high-based convection overspreading the
region appears at least possible later this afternoon, particularly
near/east of the Dodge City vicinity, aided by inflow of the
potentially more unstable air.  If this becomes sustained, shear
beneath moderate to strong westerly mid/upper flow appears more than
sufficient to support the evolution an isolated boundary-layer based
supercell or two, primarily posing a risk for severe hail and
locally strong surface gusts.

Mesoscale Discussion 0447
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0110 PM CDT Mon Apr 14 2025

Areas affected...parts of cntrl/sern SD...swrn MN...nern IA...nern
NE

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 141810Z - 142115Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...5 percent

SUMMARY...Showers spreading southeastward through the mid Missouri
Valley may begin to intensify by 3-4 PM CDT, with a few weak
thunderstorms developing and posing increasing potential for strong
to severe surface gusts while spreading southeastward through the
remainder of the afternoon.

DISCUSSION...In the wake of a deep cyclone, now migrating northeast
of the Upper Great Lakes region, downward mixing of momentum is
already contributing to 30-35+ kt northwesterly surface gusts across
much of the middle Missouri Valley, as boundary-layer warming
progresses.  This is occurring just ahead of a vigorous short wave
trough now digging through the western Dakotas, and forecast to
continue rapidly southeastward through early evening.  

Models indicate that the mid-level cold core (including -30 to -35C
around 500 mb) will overspread a corridor from central South Dakota
through northeastern Iowa between 20-23Z, coincident with further
strengthening of northwesterly flow (35-40+ kt) in the 850-700 mb
layer and peak afternoon surface heating.  As this occurs, forecast
soundings indicate that profiles will become increasingly conducive
to deepening convection capable of producing lightning. 

With at least some further intensification of ongoing developing
convection, evaporative cooling and melting of precipitation within
an increasing well-mixed boundary layer (characterized by sizable
surface temperature/dew point spreads on the order of 20+ F),
coupled with the downward mixing of stronger flow aloft, seems
likely to contribute to increasing potential for surface gusts
approaching or briefly exceeding severe limits.  This may continue
into early evening, as convection spreads southeastward, before
rapidly diminishing with the onset of boundary-layer cooling.

URGENT - IMMEDIATE BROADCAST REQUESTED
Severe Thunderstorm Watch Number 138
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
325 PM EDT Mon Apr 14 2025

The NWS Storm Prediction Center has issued a

* Severe Thunderstorm Watch for portions of 
  Central and Eastern Kentucky
  Southern Ohio
  Far Southwestern Pennsylvania
  Southwestern Virginia
  West Virginia

* Effective this Monday afternoon and evening from 325 PM until
  1100 PM EDT.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2
    inches in diameter possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms coverage is expected to increase over the
next few hours along and ahead of a cold front pushing eastward
across the region. Environmental conditions support strong to severe
storms. An initially cellular mode will favor large hail and
damaging gusts before a transition to a more linear storm mode
favors primarily damaging gusts.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 80
statute miles north and south of a line from 30 miles west of
Lexington KY to 60 miles north northeast of White Sulphur Springs
WV. For a complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch
outline update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU8).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
24040.

Day 3-8 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0333 PM CDT Sat Apr 12 2025

Valid 141200Z - 201200Z

A dry and breezy post-frontal airmass across the Central Plains,
associated with an eastward moving mid-level shortwave trough, will
result in some elevated fire-weather concerns on D3/Monday from
southwest South Dakota/northwest Nebraska into northeastern Kansas.
By D4/Tuesday, generally west-southwesterly flow will overspread the
Southwestern U.S., where deep mixing will transport momentum
downward into a warm, dry boundary layer. The ECMWF also indicates
some potential for an embedded shortwave trough to move from Baja
into the Four Corners, which could provide some enhancement to the
surface winds and associated fire-weather concerns. On D5/Wednesday,
a surface cyclone is forecast to develop in the lee of the Rockies
beneath generally zonal mid-level flow. Deep boundary layer mixing
on the west side of a dryline will result in some heightened
fire-weather concerns across portions of the western Texas Panhandle
into eastern New Mexico. Heading into D6/Thursday, a mid-level
trough is forecast to move from the Pacific Northwest into the Great
Basin, with fairly good agreement from both the ECMWF and GFS
deterministic and ensemble forecasts. This will result in an
intensifying 500mb height gradient across the southern Rockies,
along with a deepening of the forecast surface low over the
Central/Northern plains. The response in surface winds will result
in widespread 20-25 MPH winds across portions of West Texas, eastern
New Mexico, and southern Colorado with relative humidity values at
or below 10%. Future outlooks for D6/Thursday may need an upgrade to
70% Critical pending continued forecast consistency and agreement
between ensembles. While some fire-weather threat may persist into
D7/Friday and D8/Saturday across the Southern Plains, predictability
is too low for any highlight areas at this time.
