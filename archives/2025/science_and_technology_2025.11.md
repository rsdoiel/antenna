## GIMP 3.0 released

date: 2025-03-17, from: OS News

It&#8217;s taken a Herculean seven-year effort, but GIMP 3.0 has finally been released. There are so many new features, changes, and improvements in this release that it&#8217;s impossible to highlight all of them. First and foremost, GIMP 3.0 marks the shift to GTK3 &#8211; this may be surprising considering GTK4 has been out for a while, but major applications such as GIMP tend to stick to more tried and true toolkit versions. GTK4 also brings with it the prickly discussion concerning a possible adoption of libadwaita, the GNOME-specific augmentations on top of GTK4. The other major change is full support for Wayland, but users of the legacy X11 windowing system don&#8217;t have to worry just yet, since GIMP 3.0 supports that, too. As far as actual features go, there&#8217;s a ton here. Non-destructive layer effects is one of the biggest improvements. Another big change introduced in GIMP 3.0 is non-destructive (NDE) filters. In GIMP 2.10, filters were automatically merged onto the layer, which prevented you from making further edits without repeatedly undoing your changes. Now by default, filters stay active once committed. This means you can re-edit most GEGL filters in the menu on the layer dockable without having to revert your work. You can also toggle them on or off, selectively delete them, or even merge them all down destructively. If you prefer the original GIMP 2.10 workflow, you can select the “Merge Filters” option when applying a filter instead. ↫ GIMP 3.0 release notes There&#8217;s also much better color space management, better layer management and control, the user interface has been improved across the board, and support for a ton of file formats have been added, from macOS icons to Amiga ILBM/IFF formats, and much more. GIMP 3.0 also improves compatibility with Photoshop files, and it can import more palette formats, including proprietary ones like Adobe Color Book (ACB) and Adobe Swatch Exchange (ASE). This is just a small selection, as GIMP 3.0 truly is a massive update. It&#8217;s available for Linux, Windows, and macOS, and if you wait for a few days it&#8217;ll probably show up in your distribution&#8217;s package repositories.

## More pro for the DEC Professional 380 (featuring PRO/VENIX)

date: 2025-03-17, from: OS News

Settle down children, it&#8217;s time for another great article by Cameron Kaiser. This time, they&#8217;re going to tell us about the DEC Professional 380 running PRO/VENIX. The Pro 380 upgraded to the beefier J-11 (&#8220;Jaws&#8221;) CPU from the PDP-11/73, running two to three times faster than the 325 and 350. It had faster RAM and came with more of it, and boasted quicker graphics with double the vertical resolution built right into the logic board. The 380 still has its faults, notably being two-thirds the speed of the 11/73 and having no cache, plus all of the 325/350&#8217;s incompatibilities. Taken on its merits, though, it&#8217;s a tank of a machine, a reasonably powerful workstation, and the most practical PDP-adjacent thing you can actually slap on a (large) desk. This particular unit is one of the few artifacts I have left from a massive DEC haul almost twelve years ago. It runs PRO/VENIX, the only official DEC Unix option for the Pros, but in its less common final release (we&#8217;ll talk about versions of Venix). I don&#8217;t trust the clanky ST-506 hard drive anymore, so today we&#8217;ll convert it to solid state and double its base RAM to make it even more professional, and then play around in VENIX some for a taste of old-school classic Unix — after, of course, some history. ↫ Cameron Kaiser Detailed, interesting, fascinating, and full of photos as always.

## Apple’s long-lost hidden recovery partition from 1994 has been found

date: 2025-03-17, from: OS News

In 1994, a single Macintosh Performa model, the 550, came from the factory with a dedicated, hidden recovery partition that contained a System 7 system folder and a small application that would be set as bootable if the main operating system failed to boot. This application would then run, allowing you to recover your Mac using the system folder inside the recovery partition. This feature was apparently so obscure, few people knew it existed, and nobody had access to the original contents of the recovery partition anymore. It took Doug Brown a lot of searching to find a copy of this recovery partition. The issue is that nobody really knows how this partition is populated with the recovery data, so the only way to explore its contents was to somehow find a Performa 550 hard drive with a specific version of Mac OS that had never been reformatted after leaving the factory. The thing is, this whole functionality was super obscure. It’s understandable that people weren’t familiar with it. Apple publicly stated it was only included with this one specific Performa model. Their own documentation also said that it would be lost if you reformatted the hard drive. It was hiding in the background, so nobody really knew it was there, let alone thought about saving it. Also, I can say that the first thing a lot of people do when they obtain a classic computer is erase it in order to restore it to the factory state. Little did anyone know, if they reformatted the hard drive on a Performa 550, they could have been wiping out rare data that hadn’t been preserved! ↫ Doug Brown Brown found a copy, and managed to get the whole original functionality working again. It&#8217;s a fairly basic way of doing this, but we shouldn&#8217;t forget we&#8217;re talking 1994 here, and I don&#8217;t think any other operating system at the time had the ability to recover from an unbootable state like this. Like Brown, I wonder why it was abandoned so quickly. Perhaps Apple was unwilling to sacrifice the hard drive space? Groundbreaking or not, it&#8217;s still great to have this recovered and preserved for the ages.

## Microsoft accidentally cares about its users, releases update that unintentionally deletes Copilot from Windows

date: 2025-03-17, from: OS News

It&#8217;s rare in this day and age that proprietary operating system vendors like Microsoft and Apple release updates you&#8217;re more than happy to install, but considering even a broken clock is right twice a day, we&#8217;ve got one for you today. Microsoft released KB5053598 (OS Build 26100.3476) which &#8220;addresses security issues for your Windows operating system&#8221;. One of the &#8220;security issues&#8221; this update addresses, is Microsoft&#8217;s &#8220;AI&#8221; text generator, Copilot. To address this glaring security issue, this update removes Copilot from your Windows installation altogether. Sadly, it&#8217;s only by mistake, and not by design. We&#8217;re aware of an issue with the Microsoft Copilot app affecting some devices. The app is unintentionally uninstalled and unpinned from the taskbar.  Microsoft is working on a resolution to address this issue. In the meantime, affected users can reinstall the app from the Microsoft Store and manually pin it to the taskbar. ↫ Microsoft Support Well, at least until Microsoft &#8220;fixes&#8221; this &#8220;issue&#8221; with KB5053598, consider this update a simple way to get rid of Copilot. Microsoft accidentally cared about its users for once, so cherish this moment &#8211; it won&#8217;t happen again.
