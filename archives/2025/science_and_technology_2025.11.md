## GNOME 48 released

date: 2025-03-19, from: OS News

One of the two major open source desktop environments, GNOME, just released version 48, and it&#8217;s got some very big and welcome improvements. First and foremost there&#8217;s dynamic triple-buffering, a feature that took over five years of extensive testing to get ready. It will improve the smoothness and fluidity of animations and other movements on the screen, as it did for KDE when it landed there in the middle of last year. GNOME 48 also brings notification stacking, combining notifications from the same source, improvements to the new default image viewer such as image editing features, a number of digital well-being options, as well as the introduction of a new, basic audio player designed explicitly for quickly playing individual audio files. There&#8217;s also a few changes to GNOME&#8217;s text editor, and following in KDE&#8217;s recent footsteps, GNOME 48 also brings HDR support. Another major change are the new default fonts. Finally, Cantarell is gone, replaced by slightly modified versions of Inter and Iosevka. Considering I absolutely adore Inter and installing and setting it as my main font is literally the first thing I do on any system that allows me to, I&#8217;m fully behind this change. Inter is exceptional in that it renders great in both high and low DPI environments, and its readability is outstanding. GNOME 48 will make its way to your distribution&#8217;s repositories soon enough.

## Java 24 released

date: 2025-03-19, from: OS News

Oracle, the company owned by a guy who purchased a huge chunk of the Kingdom of Hawaii from the Americans, has released Java 24. I&#8217;ll be honest and upfront: I just don&#8217;t care very much at all about this, as the only interaction I&#8217;ve had with Java over the past, I don&#8217;t know, 15 years or so, is either because of Minecraft, or because of my obsession with ancient UNIX workstations where Java programs pop up in the weirdest of places. I know Java is massive and used everywhere, but going through the list of changes and improvements does not spark any joy in me at all, and just makes me want to stick my pinky in an electrical socket to make something interesting happen. If you work with Java, you know all of this stuff already anyway, as you&#8217;ve been excitedly trying to impress Nick from accounting with your knowledge of Flexible Constructor Bodies and Quantum-Resistant Module-Lattice-Based Key Encapsulation Mechanisms because he&#8217;s just so dreamy and you desperately want to ask him out for a hot cup of coffee, but you&#8217;re not sure if he&#8217;s married or has a boy or girlfriend so you&#8217;re just kind of scoping things out a bit too excitedly and now you&#8217;re worried you might be coming off as too desperate for his attention. Anyway, that&#8217;s how offices work, right? I&#8217;ve never worked for anyone but myself and office settings induce a deep sense of existential dread in me, so my knowledge of office work, and Java if we&#8217;re honest, may be based a bit too much on &#8217;90s sitcoms and dramas. Whatever, Java 24 is here. Do a happy dance.

## After 47 years, OpenVMS gets a package manager

date: 2025-03-18, from: OS News

As of the 18th of February, OpenVMS, known for its stability and high-availability, 47 years old and ported to 4 different CPU architecture, has a package manager! This article shows you how to use the package manager and talks about a few of its quirks. It&#8217;s an early beta version, and you do notice that when using it. A small list of things I noticed, coming from a Linux (apt/yum/dnf) background: There seems to be no automatic dependency resolution and the dependencies it does list are incomplete. No update management yet, no removal of packages and no support for your own package repository, only the VSI official one. Service startup or login script changes are not done automatically. Packages with multiple installer files fail and require manual intervention. It does correctly identify the architectures, has search support and makes it way easier to install software. The time saved by downloading, manually copying and starting installation is huge, so even this early beta is a very welcome addition to OpenVMS. ↫ Remy van Elst Obviously, a way to install software packages without having to manually download them is a huge step forward for OpenVMS. The listed shortcomings might raise some eyebrows considering most of us are used to package management on Linux/BSD, which is far more advanced. Bear in mind, however, that this is a beta product, and it&#8217;s quite obvious these missing essential features will be added over time. Luckily it at least lists dependencies, so let&#8217;s hope actually automating installing them is in the works and will be available soon. I actually have an OpenVMS virtual machine set up and running, but I find using it incredibly difficult &#8211; but only because of my own lack of experience with and knowledge about OpenVMS, of course. Any experience of knowledge rooted in UNIX-based and Windows operating systems is useless here, even for the most basic of CLI tasks. If I find the time, I&#8217;d love to spend more time with it and get more acquainted with the way it works, including this new package manager.

## Pebble unveils new devices, and strongly suggests you dump iOS for Android

date: 2025-03-18, from: OS News

It&#8217;s barely been two months after the announcement that Pebble would return with new watches, and they&#8217;re already here &#8211; well, sort of. Pebble has announced two new watches for preorder, the Core 2 Duo and the Core Time 2. The former is effectively a Pebble 2, upgraded with new internals, while the Core Time 2 is very similar, but comes with a colour e-ink display and a metal case. They&#8217;re up for preorder now at $149 and $225, respectively, with the Core 2 Duo shipping in July, and the Core Time 2 shipping in December. Alongside this unveil, Eric Migicovsky, the creator of Pebble, also published a blog post detailing the trouble Pebble is and will have with making smartwatches for iOS users. Apple effectively makes it impossible for third parties to make a proper smartwatch for iOS, since access to basic functionality you&#8217;d come to expect from such a device are locked by Apple, reserved only for its own Apple Watch. As such, Migicovsky makes it explicitly clear that iOS users who want to buy one of these new Pebbles will are going to have a very degraded experience compared to Android users. Not only will Android users with Pebble have access to a ton more functionality, any Pebble features that could exist for both Android and iOS users will always come to Android first, and possibly iOS later. In fact, Migicovksy goes as far as suggesting that if you want a Pebble, you should buy an Android phone. I don’t want to see any tweets or blog posts or complaints or whatever later on about this. I’m publishing this now so you can make an informed decision about whether to buy a new watch or not. If you’re worried about this, the easiest solution is to buy an Android phone. ↫ Eric Migicovsky I have to hand it to Migicovksy &#8211; I love the openness about this, and the fact he&#8217;s making this explicitly clear to any prospective buyers. There&#8217;s no sugarcoating or PR speak to try and please Tim Cook &#8211; he&#8217;s putting the blame squarely where it belongs: on Apple. It&#8217;s kind of unreal to see such directness about a new product, but as a Dutch person, it feels quite natural. We need more of this style of communication in the technology world, as it makes it much clearer that you&#8217;re getting &#8211; and not getting. I do hope that Pebble&#8217;s Android support functions without the need for Google Play Services or other proprietary Google code, since it would be great to have a proper, open source smartwatch fully supported by de-Googled Android.

## GIMP 3.0 released

date: 2025-03-17, from: OS News

It&#8217;s taken a Herculean seven-year effort, but GIMP 3.0 has finally been released. There are so many new features, changes, and improvements in this release that it&#8217;s impossible to highlight all of them. First and foremost, GIMP 3.0 marks the shift to GTK3 &#8211; this may be surprising considering GTK4 has been out for a while, but major applications such as GIMP tend to stick to more tried and true toolkit versions. GTK4 also brings with it the prickly discussion concerning a possible adoption of libadwaita, the GNOME-specific augmentations on top of GTK4. The other major change is full support for Wayland, but users of the legacy X11 windowing system don&#8217;t have to worry just yet, since GIMP 3.0 supports that, too. As far as actual features go, there&#8217;s a ton here. Non-destructive layer effects is one of the biggest improvements. Another big change introduced in GIMP 3.0 is non-destructive (NDE) filters. In GIMP 2.10, filters were automatically merged onto the layer, which prevented you from making further edits without repeatedly undoing your changes. Now by default, filters stay active once committed. This means you can re-edit most GEGL filters in the menu on the layer dockable without having to revert your work. You can also toggle them on or off, selectively delete them, or even merge them all down destructively. If you prefer the original GIMP 2.10 workflow, you can select the “Merge Filters” option when applying a filter instead. ↫ GIMP 3.0 release notes There&#8217;s also much better color space management, better layer management and control, the user interface has been improved across the board, and support for a ton of file formats have been added, from macOS icons to Amiga ILBM/IFF formats, and much more. GIMP 3.0 also improves compatibility with Photoshop files, and it can import more palette formats, including proprietary ones like Adobe Color Book (ACB) and Adobe Swatch Exchange (ASE). This is just a small selection, as GIMP 3.0 truly is a massive update. It&#8217;s available for Linux, Windows, and macOS, and if you wait for a few days it&#8217;ll probably show up in your distribution&#8217;s package repositories.

## More pro for the DEC Professional 380 (featuring PRO/VENIX)

date: 2025-03-17, from: OS News

Settle down children, it&#8217;s time for another great article by Cameron Kaiser. This time, they&#8217;re going to tell us about the DEC Professional 380 running PRO/VENIX. The Pro 380 upgraded to the beefier J-11 (&#8220;Jaws&#8221;) CPU from the PDP-11/73, running two to three times faster than the 325 and 350. It had faster RAM and came with more of it, and boasted quicker graphics with double the vertical resolution built right into the logic board. The 380 still has its faults, notably being two-thirds the speed of the 11/73 and having no cache, plus all of the 325/350&#8217;s incompatibilities. Taken on its merits, though, it&#8217;s a tank of a machine, a reasonably powerful workstation, and the most practical PDP-adjacent thing you can actually slap on a (large) desk. This particular unit is one of the few artifacts I have left from a massive DEC haul almost twelve years ago. It runs PRO/VENIX, the only official DEC Unix option for the Pros, but in its less common final release (we&#8217;ll talk about versions of Venix). I don&#8217;t trust the clanky ST-506 hard drive anymore, so today we&#8217;ll convert it to solid state and double its base RAM to make it even more professional, and then play around in VENIX some for a taste of old-school classic Unix — after, of course, some history. ↫ Cameron Kaiser Detailed, interesting, fascinating, and full of photos as always.

## Apple’s long-lost hidden recovery partition from 1994 has been found

date: 2025-03-17, from: OS News

In 1994, a single Macintosh Performa model, the 550, came from the factory with a dedicated, hidden recovery partition that contained a System 7 system folder and a small application that would be set as bootable if the main operating system failed to boot. This application would then run, allowing you to recover your Mac using the system folder inside the recovery partition. This feature was apparently so obscure, few people knew it existed, and nobody had access to the original contents of the recovery partition anymore. It took Doug Brown a lot of searching to find a copy of this recovery partition. The issue is that nobody really knows how this partition is populated with the recovery data, so the only way to explore its contents was to somehow find a Performa 550 hard drive with a specific version of Mac OS that had never been reformatted after leaving the factory. The thing is, this whole functionality was super obscure. It’s understandable that people weren’t familiar with it. Apple publicly stated it was only included with this one specific Performa model. Their own documentation also said that it would be lost if you reformatted the hard drive. It was hiding in the background, so nobody really knew it was there, let alone thought about saving it. Also, I can say that the first thing a lot of people do when they obtain a classic computer is erase it in order to restore it to the factory state. Little did anyone know, if they reformatted the hard drive on a Performa 550, they could have been wiping out rare data that hadn’t been preserved! ↫ Doug Brown Brown found a copy, and managed to get the whole original functionality working again. It&#8217;s a fairly basic way of doing this, but we shouldn&#8217;t forget we&#8217;re talking 1994 here, and I don&#8217;t think any other operating system at the time had the ability to recover from an unbootable state like this. Like Brown, I wonder why it was abandoned so quickly. Perhaps Apple was unwilling to sacrifice the hard drive space? Groundbreaking or not, it&#8217;s still great to have this recovered and preserved for the ages.

## Microsoft accidentally cares about its users, releases update that unintentionally deletes Copilot from Windows

date: 2025-03-17, from: OS News

It&#8217;s rare in this day and age that proprietary operating system vendors like Microsoft and Apple release updates you&#8217;re more than happy to install, but considering even a broken clock is right twice a day, we&#8217;ve got one for you today. Microsoft released KB5053598 (OS Build 26100.3476) which &#8220;addresses security issues for your Windows operating system&#8221;. One of the &#8220;security issues&#8221; this update addresses, is Microsoft&#8217;s &#8220;AI&#8221; text generator, Copilot. To address this glaring security issue, this update removes Copilot from your Windows installation altogether. Sadly, it&#8217;s only by mistake, and not by design. We&#8217;re aware of an issue with the Microsoft Copilot app affecting some devices. The app is unintentionally uninstalled and unpinned from the taskbar.  Microsoft is working on a resolution to address this issue. In the meantime, affected users can reinstall the app from the Microsoft Store and manually pin it to the taskbar. ↫ Microsoft Support Well, at least until Microsoft &#8220;fixes&#8221; this &#8220;issue&#8221; with KB5053598, consider this update a simple way to get rid of Copilot. Microsoft accidentally cared about its users for once, so cherish this moment &#8211; it won&#8217;t happen again.
