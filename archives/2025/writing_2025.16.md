## Seven Writing Tips from Ramy Youssef

date: 2025-04-23, from: Final Draft blog

<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3858973/?ref_=ttfc_wr_10">Ramy Youssef</a> is an actor, writer, and producer who got his start in stand-up comedy, giving him an ease and confidence in front of audiences (and a place to test jokes that later make it into his TV shows).<br>&nbsp;<br>These skills were evident at this year’s SXSW, where he premiered the first few episodes of his new Prime Video series, <span style="font-style: italic;">#1 Happy Family USA</span>. He spoke candidly to the audience about his intent with the show and the process of bringing it to fruition. He pitched it way back in 2020. During Donald Trump’s first impeachment trial.<br>&nbsp;<br>“Remember the happy Trump?” he riffed on stage. “He’s sad now, by the way. I don’t know if you guys noticed.”<br>&nbsp;<br>This, delivered during his intro of the series, with a charming approachability and the sense that he was giving us a look into how his brain works.<br>&nbsp;<br>His new animated show is a portrait of a Muslim American family living in New Jersey in 2001. (And if you think you might know where that’s going, you’re right.) But beyond that, it’s a story about identity and fitting in within a society stacked against these characters. Youssef called it a “show about capitalism.”<br>&nbsp;<br>It’s also just, you know, really funny. Each scene is crammed with sharp humor and blink-and-you’ll-miss-it visual gags.<br>&nbsp;<br>Weeks later, Final Draft hopped on a Zoom call with him to learn even more from Youssef. How does he outline? How does he balance tone? What’s different about animation? Settle in for his lessons.</p>

## 5 Fast Ways to Be a Better Screenwriter

<p>Your screenwriting journey is all about evolving as a screenwriter. Everyone generally starts at the same place. As we progress by educating ourselves (screenwriting books, screenwriting blogs, reading produced screenplays, etc.), we begin to add to our knowledge base. We build a go-to tool belt. Then, as we begin to write scripts, we learn through trial by fire and trial by error. We slowly get better and better with each script.&nbsp;<br><br>But there comes a time, even after those first two or three scripts, when you begin to hit a ceiling of sorts.&nbsp;<br><br>Becoming a better screenwriter is all about leveling-up. You get to stages that teach you valuable lessons. You advance to the next stage after applying what you’ve learned. This evolution is great, but there are a few ways that can help you jumpstart your evolution even more, catapulting you past many of those sometimes mundane stages.&nbsp;<br><br>With that in mind, here are five fast ways you can be a better screenwriter.&nbsp;</p>

## Harmattan Season by Tochi Onyebuchi: Review by Gary K. Wolfe

date: 2025-04-22, from: Locus Magazine

<p><strong>Harmattan Season</strong>, Tochi Onyebuchi (Tor 978-1250782977, 240pp, $27.99, hc) May 2025.</p>
<p>I think it’s safe to say, on the basis of <strong>Riot Baby </strong>and <strong>Goliath </strong>alone, that we didn’t have any idea what to expect next from the adventurous Tochi Onyebuchi. But I doubt that even his most assidu­ous readers were anticipating a hardboiled his­torical/political private-eye postcolonialist noir fantasy mystery (and even at that, I’ve probably left some stuff  <a href="https://locusmag.com/2025/04/harmattan-season-by-tochi-onyebuchi-review-by-gary-k-wolfe/" class="read-more">...Read More </a></p>
