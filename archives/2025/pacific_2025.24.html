<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;When Pope Leo XIV was selected in May as the next leader of the Catholic Church, his hometown, Chicago, erupted in shocked delight. There were joyful newspaper headlines (&amp;#8220;DA POPE!&amp;#8221;), impromptu gatherings at parishes across the city, and a &amp;#8220;Pope-A-Roni&amp;#8221; pie marketed by a local pizza joint.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>date: 2025-06-15, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Small, difficult to detect and able to pack a powerful punch, attack drones have become a formidable weapon in modern warfare. But when launched from deep inside enemy territory &amp;#8212; as in Iran and in Russia this month &amp;#8212; their impact is all the more devastating.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>date: 2025-06-15, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;There is much to appreciate about the ongoing Kilauea summit eruption as it approaches its six-month anniversary on June 23. The stunning episodic lava fountains and lava flows erupting within Halema&amp;#8216;uma&amp;#8216;u crater in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park have provided island residents and visitors with safe and accessible viewing opportunities. However, volcanic hazards are always present.&lt;/p&gt;
