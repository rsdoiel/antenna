Tesla (TSLA) sales declined quarter-over-quarter in China despite the
Model Y refresh being available and offering record discounts. It goes
directly against what the automaker claimed after the first quarter.

pull the trigger on a new EV this month, you’re in luck! There are
plenty of great options with zero interest financing to choose from …
and one with zero interest in general.

id="lectric-xp-trike2-launched-as-the-affordable-new-electric-trike-every-senior-needs">Lectric
XP Trike2 launched as the affordable new electric trike every senior
needs!</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-08, from: Electrek Feed</p>
<div class="feat-image">
<img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/07/lectric-xp-trike2-header-1.jpg?quality=82&#038;strip=all&#038;w=1600" />

<p>
The new <a href="https://lectricebikes.sjv.io/Z6e6zR">Lectric XP
Trike2</a>, just unveiled today, is the hands-down winner in the
best-bang-for-your-buck category of electric trikes. And as perhaps the
longest-running electric bike reviewer in the industry, I can say that
with confidence. I’ve seen a lot of electric bikes in my time. I’ve
spent a lot of butt-in-saddle hours on e-trikes. But I’ve never before
seen a value like this roll by on three wheels.
</p>
<p>
As an able-bodied, mid-30s electric bike rider (and writer), I’ll be the
first to say that electric trikes aren’t just for older folks. They’re
fun e-bikes in their own right. But let’s face it – the vast majority of
the market for electric three-wheelers are those who just aren’t as
comfortable on two wheels due to age, accessibility, or other reasons.
And so if you’re a senior or otherwise on the hunt for a fun and
affordable electric trike, the Lectric XP Trike2 is probably the one
you’re going to end up getting, and deservingly so!

Hyundai flew us out to Savannah, Georgia, a few weeks ago to get our
first impressions of the much-anticipated Ioniq 9 three-row SUV.
Incidentally, Hyundai’s new factory, located just outside Savannah
(pictured below), has begun assembling the Ioniq 9 and offering a $
7,500 tax credit, available for a limited time.
</p>
<p>
The Ioniq 9 uses the same E-GMP platform as the Kia EV9 and some smaller
HMG EVs but the real question is: how is the Ioniq 9 different? Let’s
take a look…

Paris’ bike-share system,
<a href="https://www.velib-metropole.fr/en">Vélib</a> has long been
considered one of the shining success stories of urban micromobility.
With a massive fleet of over 20,000 pedal and electric-assist bicycles
around Paris, the service has helped millions of residents and tourists
get around the City of Light without needing a car or scooter. But
lately, a growing problem is threatening to knock the wheels off this
urban mobility marvel: theft and joyriding.

<p>
The Honda Ruckus has earned cult status thanks to its minimalist
styling, exposed frame, and seemingly endless customizability. The
scooter, also known in international markets as the Honda Zoomer, has
spent years being seen as a blank canvas for scooter tuners, urban
commuters, and anyone who just wanted something simple, small, and kind
of weird to zip around town. A few years ago, Honda finally answered the
call for an updated version by announcing and producing the “Zoomer e:”,
which was an electric version of the Honda Ruckus. So where is it?
