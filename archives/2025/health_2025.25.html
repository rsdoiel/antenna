evaluation of a novel H. pylori fecal molecular diagnosis kit (multiplex
RT-PCR method) for detecting clarithromycin and fluoroquinolones
resistance using stool samples</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundHelicobacter pylori infection poses a significant global
health challenge, exacerbated by rising antibiotic resistance. This
study aimed to evaluate a novel multiplex RT-PCR-based fecal diagnostic
kit (Cowin Biosciences, Jiangsu, China) for detecting mutations in the
23S rRNA and gyrA genes associated with clarithromycin and
fluoroquinolone resistance in H. pylori.MethodsA total of 1,176
participants from four clinical centers in China were enrolled between
August 2022 and October 2023. Phenotypic resistance was assessed on H.
pylori isolated from gastric samples using the minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) method (E-test), while fecal samples were analyzed
molecularly via the diagnostic kit and Sanger sequencing. Positive
(PPA), negative (NPA), and overall percentage agreement (OPA) with 95%
confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.ResultsThere was a high level
of consistency between phenotypic testing and novel diagnostic kit. The
PPA, NPA, and OPA of the fecal diagnostic kit for detecting
clarithromycin susceptibility were 92.97% (CI: 90.6%-95.3%), 87.89% (CI:
85.0%-90.8%), and 90.36% (CI: 88.5%-92.3%), respectively. And likewise,
the PPA, NPA, and OPA in diagnosing H. pylori resistance to
fluoroquinolones were 86.85% (CI:83.6%- 90.1%), 91.12% (CI:
88.6%-93.7%), and 89.12% (CI: 87.1%-91.1%), respectively. Beyond that,
the diagnostic kit also exhibited a high degree of concordance with the
outcomes of Sanger sequencing. Specifically, when assessing
clarithromycin resistance, the PPA, NPA, and OPA of the diagnostic kit
were 97.13% (CI: 95.7%-98.6%), 94.62% (CI: 92.6%-96.6%), and 95.90% (CI:
94.7%-97.1%), respectively. Similarly, application of the diagnostic kit
to detect fluoroquinolone resistance achieved a PPA of 96.92% (CI:
94.9%-98.4%), an NPA of 93.18% (CI: 91.0%-95.3%), and an OPA of 94.69%
(CI: 93.3%-96.1%). The concordance rate between the fecal kit and
phenotypic susceptibility testing varied with MIC values. For
clarithromycin resistance, the positive percentage agreement (PPA) was
lowest (89.74%) when MIC exceeded 256 µg/mL but peaked at 96.47% for MIC
values between 32 and 256 µg/mL. The highest overall concordance (Kappa
= 0.774) was observed at intermediate MIC levels (4–32 µg/mL),
suggesting optimal detection accuracy in this range.ConclusionsThe fecal
diagnostic kit provides a rapid, non-invasive, and reliable method to
predict clarithromycin and fluoroquinolone resistance, supporting
personalized therapy.Clinical Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov,

of human respiratory tract infection in Chongqing, China after
COVID-19–based on surveillance data encompassing 17 respiratory
pathogens</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundRespiratory tract infections (RTIs) are an important public
health concern, and SARS-CoV-2 affects the epidemic pattern of RTIs
globally. National multipathogenic surveillance for RTIs was conducted
in mid-October 2023. However, baseline data on the pathogen spectrum of
RTIs in Chongqing, China, before mid-October 2023 are limited.MethodsA
descriptive analysis was conducted to determine the epidemiology of RTIs
in Chongqing, China, in 2023.Results A total of 1,894 individuals were
included in 2023, with an overall positivity rate of 28.7%. The highest
overall positivity rate was observed in May 2023 (53.0%). Different
predominant respiratory pathogens were observed among different age
groups. Among all single-infected individuals, SARS-CoV-2 accounted for
32.1%, followed by IFV, which accounted for 28.2%. In the children
group, RSV ranked first, accounting for 15.7%. Among school-aged
children, IFV ranked the top, accounting for 46.7%. SARS-CoV-2 ranked
the top among adults and the elderly, accounting for 45.5% and 47.0%,
respectively.ConclusionsThe local pathogen spectrum of RTIs one year
after the onset of COVID-19 showed that SARS-CoV-2 was steady, and viral
infection might be the main cause of RTIs. Both upper respiratory tract
infections and lower respiratory tract infections (LRIs) showed high RTI
positivity rates. The pathogen spectra of upper respiratory tract
infections (URIs) and LRIs differ in adults. Holistic surveillance of
RTIs is necessary to estimate the local disease burden. Vaccination
against respiratory infections remains an important strategy to prevent
and control RTIs.</p>

and placental microbiome and immune crosstalk in pregnancies with
small-for-gestational-age fetuses – a pilot case-control study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionPregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction are
associated with specific bacterial abundances and elevation of
proinflammatory cytokines. The aim of the study was to simultaneously
analyze the relation between the gut and placenta microbiome and
cytokine profile in pregnant women with fetuses appropriate (AGA) and
small for gestational age (SGA).Material and methodsWomen with singleton
pregnancies at or beyond 32 weeks of gestation were recruited. 11
delivered SGA newborns (study group) and 11 AGA newborns (control
group). Samples of maternal venous blood, stool and placenta were
collected perinatally.ResultsIn SGA group lower Chao index in placental
samples collected from maternal side, while higher Chao index in
placental samples collected from fetal side were observed. Taxonomic
analysis identified four significantly less abundant genera in samples
collected from maternal side. No taxa remained significant after
correction in samples from fetal side, but several taxa showed trends of
differing abundance. Veillonella showed a trend toward higher abundance
in stool samples in SGA group, while other taxa were significant only at
a lower threshold. Metabolite analysis revealed that hexanoic acid was
significantly elevated compound in the stool of women from the SGA
group. Proteobacteria unclassified and Halomonadaceae correlated with
stool metabolites, while IL-6 and TNF-α correlated with specific
bacterial groups.ConclusionsSpecific changes in the gut microbiome and
metabolome as well as placenta microbiome of women with SGA have been
observed, with additional associations with inflammatory cytokine
levels, suggesting a potential role of these factors in SGA development
and highlighting the need for further research.</p>

periodontitis microbiome research: integrating design, analysis, and
technology</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease affecting 20%-50% of
adults worldwide, is driven by polymicrobial synergy and dysbiosis.
Despite numerous studies on the oral microbiota in periodontitis,
significant heterogeneity exists between findings, posing challenges for
treatment strategies. To understand the sources of this variability and
establish standardized protocols, we reviewed the literature to identify
potential factors contributing to these discrepancies. We found most
studies focus on microbial communities in periodontal pockets, with
fewer investigating microbial composition within gingival tissue.
Research indicates that bacterial communities in gingival tissue exist
as biofilms, potentially serving as reservoirs for persistent infection.
Therefore, further exploration of the microbiome within periodontal
tissues is needed, which may offer new insights for treatment
strategies. Metatranscriptomics provides valuable insights into gene
expression patterns of the oral microbiota, enabling the exploration of
microbial activity at a functional level. Previous studies revealed that
most upregulated virulence factors in periodontitis originate from
species not traditionally considered major periodontal pathogens.
However, current studies have not fully identified or revealed the
functional changes in key symbiotic microbes in periodontitis. We
reviewed the analytical paradigms of metatranscriptomics and found that
current analysis is largely limited to assessing functional changes in
known periodontal pathogens, highlighting the need for a
functional-driven approach. Beyond the limitations of current analytical
paradigms, the metatranscriptomics also has inherent constraints. We
suggested integrating emerging high-throughput microbial sequencing
technologies with functional-driven analytical strategies to provide a
more comprehensive and higher-resolution insight for microbiome
reconstruction in periodontitis.</p>

<h2 id="a-rare-wohlfahrtiimonas-strain-linked-to-human-infection">A rare
Wohlfahrtiimonas strain linked to human infection</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Wohlfahrtiimonas is an infrequently encountered Gram-negative
bacterium capable of infecting humans and, in severe instances,
precipitating sepsis. Presently, three species within the
Wohlfahrtiimonas genus have been identified, with Wohlfahrtiimonas
chitiniclastica being the sole species implicated in human infections.
To date, there has been only one documented case of human infection with
W. chitiniclastica in China. In this study, we present an additional
case of human infection with a Wohlfahrtiimonas species. Notably,
through 16S rRNA gene sequencing and whole-genome sequencing, the strain
was identified as an unclassified species closely related to W.
chitiniclastica DSM 18708T.</p>

impact of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid metagenomics next-generation
sequencing on the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected
pulmonary infection</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectivesThis study aimed to enhance the comprehension of the
practical utility of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) metagenomic
next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in the clinical management of patients
with suspected pneumonia.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 296
individuals who underwent BALF mNGS and conventional microbial tests
(CMTs) for suspected pneumonia. We compared the clinical characteristics
between patients with pulmonary infection (PI) and those without
pulmonary infection (NPI). The detection rate of mNGS and CMTs in
different groups of patients were compared. The Sankey diagram was used
to present the results of the influence of mNGS on diagnosis and
treatment.ResultsComparison between PI and NPI showed that individuals
with fever, concurrent malignant tumors, consolidation or ground-glass
opacity on chest CT(Computed tomography) images, and elevated
inflammatory markers on blood tests were more likely to develop lung
infections. Analysis of the rate of positive detection between CMTs and
mNGS in various subgroups revealed that mNGS had a significantly higher
positive detection rate in patients with pulmonary infections (87.95%
vs. 71.06%, p&lt;0.001), in immunocompetent patients (86.91% vs. 68.08%,
p&lt;0.001), and in patients with malignant tumors (92.31% vs. 69.23%,
p=0.035). Furthermore, mNGS helped initiate appropriate antibiotic
treatment and confirmed the effectiveness of empirical treatment.
Compared to immunocompetent patients, BALF mNGS in immunocompromised
individuals with suspected lung infections yielded higher rates of
accurate diagnosis (62.86% vs. 42.79%, p = 0.027) and more effective
treatment (71.43% vs. 58.56%, p = 0.148).ConclusionsBALF mNGS identified
a greater variety of pathogens than CMTs. Immunocompromised patients
with suspected pneumonia may benefit more from BALF mNGS.</p>

<p>date: 2025-06-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Ischemic stroke (IS) is a severe central nervous system disorder
characterized by high incidence, disability, mortality, and recurrence
rates, along with numerous complications. The microbiota-gut-brain axis
(MGBA) represents a bidirectional communication pathway between the
brain and the gut, which can influence the onset and progression of IS
through neural, immunoregulatory, and gut metabolite pathways. Recent
preclinical and clinical evidence supports the use of fecal microbiota
transplantation (FMT), probiotics and prebiotics, dietary interventions,
and antibiotics as strategies to suppress neuroinflammation in IS,
protect the blood-brain barrier, modulate immune responses, and improve
stroke outcomes. In this review, we summarize the manifestations of
innate inflammation and adaptive immunity following the onset of IS,
highlight the interactions between the MGBA and post-stroke
neuroinflammation, and discuss current therapeutic measures, thus
providing insights for the development of novel treatment strategies in
the future.</p>

Hainan: a prospective study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveTinea capitis, a chronic inflammatory disease of the scalp
and hair shafts caused by dermatophyte infections, ​manifests clinically​
as erythematous lesions, scaling, alopecia, and pustule formation.
Hainan, a tropical island province in China, exhibits distinctive
climatic conditions and demographic contact patterns that ​could shape​
its pathogen spectrum. However, comprehensive epidemiological data
​remain scarce. This study ​analyzes​ the epidemiological characteristics
and pathogen spectrum of tinea capitis in Hainan, China.MethodsThis
study ​was undertaken​ across 11 coastal and inland dermatological centers
in Hainan Province (January 2023 to December 2024). A total of 76 tinea
capitis patients ​diagnosed​ via mycological examination (fungal
fluorescence microscopy, fungal culture with species identification) ​and
corroborated​ by dermatoscopic evaluation ​were consecutively enrolled.
Data on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and clinical
manifestations ​were systematically collated​ using standardized case
report forms. Pathogen subtyping ​was performed via​ integrated
morphological identification ​supplemented by​ molecular biological
analysis of the ITS region.ResultsAmong 76 enrolled patients, minors
(≤15 years) ​accounted for​ 80.26% (61/76), with ≤10-year-olds
​representing​ 91.8% (56/61) of pediatric cases. The overall
male-to-female ratio ​was recorded as​ 1:1.05 (37 males vs. 39 females),
while pediatric patients (≤15 years) ​exhibited​ a 1.07:1 ratio (31 males
vs. 29 females). Animal contact history ​was reported in​ 31 cases
(40.79%), scalp trauma in 3 cases (3.95%), and co-occurring superficial
fungal infections in 12 cases (15.79%). ​Fungal elements were detected​
via direct microscopic examination in 64 cases (84.21%). Fungal cultures
​obtained​ 45 positive isolates (19 strains in 2023, 26 in 2024), with
kerion (inflammatory tinea capitis) ​exhibiting​ the highest culture
positivity rate, followed by tinea alba. ​The primary pathogens
identified​ were zoophilic Microsporum canis (M. canis) (20 cases,
43.79%) and anthropophilic Trichophyton rubrum (T. rubrum) (9 strains,
19.57%). Clinical manifestations ​comprised​ kerion (44 cases, 57.89%),
tinea alba (27 cases, 35.53%), and black dot tinea (5 cases, 6.58%).
Kerion cases ​were predominantly linked to​ M. canis and T. mentagrophytes
(interdigital subtype), whereas tinea alba ​demonstrated​ infections by M.
canis and T. rubrum. Black dot lesions ​were additionally observed​ in M.
canis infections.ConclusionThe primary affected group is children ≤10
years old, with the most common pathogenic fungus being zoophilic M.
canis, and clinical classification is predominantly kerion.
Dermatologists should pay attention to different transmission routes and
pathogen spectra.</p>

bacterial and fungal communities associated with Fusarium-wilt
symptomatic and non-symptomatic ‘Gros Michel’ banana plants in
Ecuador</h2>
<p>date: 2025-06-23, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Fusarium wilt of banana (FWB), caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp.
cubense (Foc), remains a critical threat to banana production worldwide.
Despite the persistence of the disease in fields planted with
susceptible cultivars such as ‘Gros Michel’, little is known about the
microbial interactions influencing symptom development. In this study,
we assessed the bacterial and fungal communities associated to
symptomatic and non-symptomatic ‘Gros Michel’ bananas plants sampled in
Ecuador banana fields affected by Foc race 1. We aimed to compare their
diversity, composition, and to identify potential microbial taxa that
could be active in disease suppression. Samples were collected from the
pseudostem, rhizome, and rhizosphere, and analyzed through
high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA and ITS2 regions to
characterize bacterial and fungal communities, respectively. Results
revealed that non-symptomatic plants harbored significantly higher
bacterial diversity, particularly in pseudostem and rhizome tissues,
compared to symptomatic plants. Genera including, Bacillus,
Enterobacter, Paenibacillus, Pectobacterium, Herbaspirillum and
Pseudomonas were enriched in non-symptomatic tissues, suggesting a
potential role in disease suppression. In contrast, symptomatic plants
showed an increased abundance of genera such as Klebsiella and
Kosakonia. Fungal community shifts were less pronounced, indicating that
bacterial dynamics may play a more critical role in disease development.
These findings shed light on the key microbial taxa associated with
FWB-affected banana plants and the potential role of their microbiome to
plant health and disease suppression.</p>
