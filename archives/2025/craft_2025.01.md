## A Video Tour of the Work at our HQ

date: 2025-01-09, from: Lost Arg Press blog

## Bringing ‘The Woodworker’ Books Back

date: 2025-01-07, from: Lost Arg Press blog

This week I’ve signed off on a new press run of our four-volume set of “The Woodworker: The Charles H. Hayward Years.” We ran out of stock last year, and reprinting the books became prohibitively expensive (thanks, inflation!). I didn’t want to charge people more than $200 for these foundational texts on handwork. So we...

date: 2025-01-07, from: Lost Arg Press blog

The following is a portion of the introduction to Karvsnitt: Carving, Pattern and Color in the Slöjd Tradition.

## The Archivist’s Tool Chest: Thinking Inside the Box

date: 2025-01-05, from: Lost Arg Press blog

The below was written by our good friend Mattias Hallin, who lives in Belgium (though he would, I think, want me to let you know he is Swedish). You might recall that he is our non-resident expert in linseed oil paint, from this 2024 post (and he wrote for us about overseas ordering, for those...
