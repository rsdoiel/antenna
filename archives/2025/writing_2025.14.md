<p>It’s hard to escape Minecraft. Over 200 million people play the game each month with about 43% consisting of players between the ages of 15-21. If you have kids, they’ve probably asked to play Minecraft (and you probably have the game in some capacity in your home).</p>

## The Dark, Apex, and Nightmare: Short Fiction Reviews by Paula Guran

date: 2025-04-11, from: Locus Magazine

<p>The Dark 1/25
Apex #148
Nightmare 1/25</p>
<p>The first of two originals in The Dark #116 might fit well in The Deadlands. “<strong>Four Ques­tions with Something Like God</strong>” by <strong>Carlie St. George </strong>is a listicle story dealing with a dead person who wishes to persist. At first, it seems the issue’s second tale, “<strong>Lost You Again</strong>” by <strong>Ian Rogers</strong>, could fit as well.

## Paul Thomas Anderson’s Filmmaking Journey

date: 2025-04-10, from: Final Draft blog

</div> 
<p>With the trailer for Paul Thomas Anderson’s new film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap-j8e9J5U0"><em>One Battle After Another</em></a> hitting the internet, the veteran filmmaker shows he can still create a buzz. This is partially due to the film being his first collaboration with movie star Leonardo DiCaprio, but PTA’s films have also always generated excitement, especially from cinephiles who view him as a master of the craft and a true “auteur” (a filmmaker who both writes <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> directs his films).&nbsp;<br><br>PTA is a writer-director with a distinct and unique <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/finding-your-voice">voice</a> and he has always followed his creative instincts throughout his filmmaking career. Even if your focus is on being <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/how-to-be-a-screenwriter-in-5-basic-steps">a screenwriter</a> and you don’t have directorial aspirations, there’s plenty to learn from PTA’s films — all of which are based on screenplays he has written — and from his integrity as an artist who never compromised. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>PTA’s entire life has revolved around the love of movies and telling compelling stories. Like his peer <a href="https://blog.finaldraft.com/how-watching-movies-taught-quentin-tarantino-and-can-teach-screenwriters">Quentin Tarantino</a>, not only does he epitomize Gen X postmodernism, PTA’s enthusiasm for his vocation is evident in every meticulous frame and line of dialogue of his work. Not surprisingly, PTA never considered doing anything else but filmmaking, and he started making movies at an age when most kids are still playing with toys. &nbsp;</p>

## Wake Up and Open Your Eyes by Clay McLeod Chapman: Review by Gabino Iglesias

<p>Being a fan of an author and reading every­thing they publish is a lot of fun, and it’s even more fun when the author in question constantly changes what they do.

So, I did use contests. I use them judiciously. I did a lot of research on what contests were worthwhile. Both their prize packages as well as their reputation.

## How to Handle Screenwriting Rejection Like a Pro

<p>Nobody likes rejection. It doesn’t feel good. It creates an immediate negative emotional and physical response. A study from the University of Amsterdam found that unexpected social rejection triggers the parasympathetic nervous system, which governs our body’s “rest and digest” functions. Unlike the “fight or flight” response, which heightens alertness, rejection causes our heart rate to slow, leading to feelings of disorientation, sadness, and even physical lethargy.<br><br>Rejection is not fun and never will be, no matter what the situation.&nbsp;<br><br>However, rejection is also a powerful tool that you can use to become a better you — <span style="font-weight: bold;">and</span> a better screenwriter. A not-so-famous and moderately successful pro screenwriter (yours truly) once said, <em>“You have to fail before you can prevail.”</em> It’s a quote that I live by in my career.&nbsp;<br><br>I’ve learned to thrive through rejection. It still sucks, but you can turn it into the necessary motivation to help you become not just a better and stronger screenwriter, but also a better and stronger person. Here we’ll cover how you can handle screenwriting rejection like a pro. But before we do…&nbsp;</p>

</div> 
<p>On today’s episode of Write On, we chat with Kim Rosenstock, co-creator and co-showrunner for the new limited series, <em>Dying For Sex</em>, starring Michelle Williams, Jenny Slate and Sissy Spacek.&nbsp;<br><br>Based on a true story, <em>Dying for Sex</em> is about a woman diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer who abandons her husband of 15 years to begin a journey of sexual discovery.<br><br>Rosenstock talks about her background as a playwright, nearly missing out on the opportunity to write for the hit show <em>New Girl</em>, and navigating the complicated tone of <em>Dying For Sex</em> that balances a woman having unconventional, often hilarious sexual escapades with facing her own mortality.&nbsp;<br><br>“We need humor the most as human beings, so don’t be afraid of injecting humor and joy and levity into these sort of subject matters… If you have the impulse to make it funny or to make it feel joyful or hopeful, lean into that and don’t be afraid of it. I also think that is what makes it feel real, actually. To me, that makes it feel more honest, not the other way around… I think what’s exciting is that audiences are embracing these kinds of stories that can kind of go into darker and lighter places at the same time,” says Rosenstock about mixing joy and sadness in <em>Dying For Sex</em>.&nbsp;<br><br>To hear more, listen to the podcast. Please be advised the interview includes discussion of sexual abuse.&nbsp;<br><br><em>Dying for Sex</em> is currently streaming on Hulu.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since 2011, <a href="https://cinemacon.com/">CinemaCon</a> has transformed Las Vegas into the movie industry’s ultimate insider gathering each year, drawing studios, stars, and distributors for a glimpse at Hollywood’s coming attractions.&nbsp;<br><br>The event is the official convention of the <a href="https://cinemaunited.org/">Cinema United</a>, formerly The National Association of Theatre Owners. Obviously, the organization is focused on getting people into theaters to watch movies on the big screen. Hey, that’s my preference, too.<br><br>Think of it as a massive trade show where industry players reveal their cards for the months ahead. While there are plenty of <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/tom-cruise-mission-impossible-cinemacon-1236358190/">celebrities plugging their latest</a> and big trailer premieres, screenwriters should pay attention to what’s happening amidst the glitz. There’s value in understanding which genres and stories are actually (hopefully) selling tickets. Smart writers can take these insights to position their work in Hollywood.&nbsp;<br><br>So here are some of the key lessons we noticed this year.</p>

## New Florida, an Alien RPG scenario

Over the weekend, friends and I played our first game of Free League’s Alien The Roleplaying Game. We had a blast. The game mechanics are fun, built around a Stress mechanic that basically ensures characters will freak out at some point. Alien RPG can be played in campaign mode, where characters progress over many sessions [&#8230;]
