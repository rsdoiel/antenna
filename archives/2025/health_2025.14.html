microbiota transplantation alleviates lipopolysaccharide-induced
osteoporosis by modulating gut microbiota and long non-coding RNA TUG1
expression</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-11, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>PurposeTo study whether fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) can
alleviate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced osteoporosis (OP) by
regulating the composition and abundance of gut microbiota and the
expression level of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) TUG1.MethodsTwenty
C57BL/6 mice were selected. Two mice were randomly designated as fecal
donors, while the remaining mice were randomly divided into control
group, LPS group, and LPS + FMT group. Each group consisted of 6 mice.
The mice in the LPS and LPS + FMT groups were intraperitoneally injected
with LPS to establish the OP model, and the mice in the LPS + FMT group
were treated with donor feces by gavage. Micro-CT was used to scan the
femur specimens of mice, and the bone structural parameters of the
control and LPS groups were compared to verify the effectiveness of the
OP model. HE staining was used to compare the microstructure of femurs
in the 3 groups. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to analyze the
composition and abundance of gut microbiota in mice. Immunofluorescence
staining was used to compare the expression levels of Runt-related
transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) in the femur of the 3 groups. Real-time
quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to compare the
expression levels of lncRNA TUG1 in the intestines and serum of mice in
the 3 groups.ResultsMicro-CT showed that compared with the control
group, the mice in the LPS group had more bone loss. The bone mineral
density, trabecular number, and trabecular thickness of the control
group was higher, and the trabecular separation was smaller. The models
were validated effectively. HE staining showed that compared with the
control group, the bone trabeculae in the LPS group were thinner and
sparse, while that in the LPS + FMT group were dense and clear. The 16s
rRNA sequencing showed that the abundance of Bacteroides and
Lactobacillus in LPS+FMT group was significantly higher than that in LPS
group. Immunofluorescence staining showed that the RUNX2 level in the
control group and LPS + FMT group was similar, and both were higher than
that in the LPS group. The qRT-PCR results showed that the TUG1 mRNA
level in the control group and LPS + FMT group was similar and
significantly higher than that in the LPS group.ConclusionFMT can
enhance osteoblast levels and improve bone structure by modulating the
abundance of gut microbiota in OP mice (such as increasing Bacteroides
and Lactobacillus populations) and promoting the expression of lncRNA
TUG1, thereby alleviating LPS-induced OP.</p>

Microbiology</p>
<p>Bone marrow is vital for hematopoiesis, producing blood cells
essential for oxygen transport, immune defense, and clotting. However,
disorders like leukemia, lymphoma, aplastic anemia, and myelodysplastic
syndromes can severely disrupt its function, leading to life-threatening
complications. Traditional treatments, including chemotherapy and stem
cell transplants, have significantly improved patient outcomes but are
often associated with severe side effects and limitations, necessitating
the exploration of safer, more targeted therapeutic strategies.
Nanotechnology has emerged as a promising approach for addressing these
challenges, particularly in the delivery of nutraceuticals—bioactive
compounds derived from food sources with potential therapeutic benefits.
Despite their promise, nutraceuticals often face clinical limitations
due to poor bioavailability, instability, and inefficient delivery to
target sites. Nanoparticles offer a viable solution by enhancing the
stability, absorption, and targeted transport of nutraceuticals to bone
marrow while minimizing systemic side effects. This study explores a
range of bone marrow disorders, conventional treatment modalities, and
the potential of nanoparticles to enhance nutraceutical-based therapies.
By improving targeted delivery and therapeutic efficacy, nanoparticles
could revolutionize bone marrow disease management, providing patients
with more effective and less invasive treatment options. These
advancements represent a significant step toward safer and more
efficient therapeutic approaches, ultimately improving patient prognosis
and overall health.</p>

gondii, endothelial cells and schizophrenia: is it just a barrier
matter?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Toxoplasma gondii is an obligatory intracellular parasite responsible
for causing toxoplasmosis. It is estimated that approximately one-third
of the world’s population has positive serology for toxoplasmosis. Acute
T. gondii infection often results in subtle symptoms because of its
nonspecific nature. Owing to immune pressure, parasites tend to encyst
and persist in different tissues and organs, such as the brain,
chronicling the infection. While most chronically infected individuals
do not develop significant symptoms, the parasite can affect the central
nervous system (CNS), leading to symptoms that range from dizziness to
behavioral changes. To reach the CNS, parasites must overcome the
blood–brain barrier, which is composed primarily of endothelial cells.
While these cells are typically efficient at separating blood elements
from the CNS, in T. gondii infection, they not only permit parasitic
colonization of the CNS but also contribute to an inflammatory profile
that may exacerbate previously established conditions at both the local
CNS and systemic levels. An increasing body of research has demonstrated
a potential link between the CNS, infection by T. gondii and the
cellular or humoral response to infection, with the worsening of
psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia. Therefore, continually
advancing research aimed at understanding and mitigating the
relationship between parasitic infection and schizophrenia is
imperative.</p>

of Escherichia coli pathotypes with fecal markers of enteropathy and
nutritional status among underweight adults in Bangladesh</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionEnvironmental enteric dysfunction (EED), a subclinical
intestinal disorder, is characterized by chronic fecal-oral exposure to
entero-pathogens and could be diagnosed by measuring non-invasive
biomarkers. Escherichia coli is the one of the key bacterial enteric
pathogens that drives EED, but there is a lack of information on the E.
coli pathotypes in relation to the biomarkers of EED in malnourished
adults. Here, we intended to measure the possible association of these
pathotypes with EED biomarkers and nutritional status of adults residing
in a slum in Bangladesh.MethodFecal samples were collected from 524
malnourished adults (BMI ≤18.5 kg/m2) living in a slum-setting in Dhaka
from March 2016 to September 2019 and analyzed by TaqMan Array Card
assays to evaluate the presence of E. coli pathotypes and other
entero-pathogens. The multivariable linear regression model was used to
assess the association.ResultsIn these malnourished adults, the most
prevalent pathotype of E. coli was EAEC (61.7%) and the least prevalent
was STEC (6.7%). The prevalence of atypical EPEC, ETEC and Shigella/EIEC
were 52%, 48.9% and 45.1% respectively. The infection with atypical EPEC
had significant positive association with levels of Myeloperoxidase (b =
0.38; 95% CI = 0.11, 0.65; p-value = 0.006). Similarly, a significantly
higher concentration of alpha-1-antitrypsin (b = 0.13; 95% CI = 0.03,
0.22; p-value = 0.011) was found in the STEC-infected adults. However,
no notable association was found between the E. coli pathotypes and
nutritional status of these adult participants. Moreover, Plesiomonas
infected adults were more likely to be infected with EAEC (p-value =
0.017), ETEC (p-value &lt;0.001) and STEC (pvalue = 0.002). Significant
coinfection was also detected among the pathotypes and other
entero-pathogens such as Giardia, Ascaris, Campylobacter, Salmonella,
Enterocytozoon bieneusi, and Adenovirus.DiscussionThe study results
imply that there is an influence of particular E. coli pathotypes (EPEC
and STEC) on intestinal inflammation and gut permeability of the
malnourished Bangladeshi adults, but no association with nutritional
status is found. Potential pathogenicity of the E. coli pathotypes is
also observed when co-infection with other pathogens exists in these
adults.</p>

pan-genomic analysis reveals pathogenic mechanisms and genomic
plasticity in Vibrio parahaemolyticus clinical and environmental
isolates</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionVibrio parahaemolyticus is a human pathogen capable of
inducing bacterial gastroenteritis. Clinical strains of V.
parahaemolyticus are considered pathogenic due to their possession of
hemolysin and a type III secretion system (T3SS). Some environmental
isolates are also acquiring corresponding virulence genes.MethodsThis
study initially examines the infection characteristics of V.
parahaemolyticus, and subsequently employs pan-genomic analysis to
identify genes that exhibit significant differences in distribution
between environmental and clinical isolates, thereby revealing their
potential impact on virulence.Results and discussionThe epidemiological
analysis of clinical isolates suggests that infections of V.
parahaemolyticus are more prevalent in warm seasons, with O4:KUT
serotype presenting more severe symptoms. OrthoFinder analysis revealed
that environmental isolates possess a higher number of core genes.
PEPPAN and KEGG analysis revealed that the 10 genes exclusively found in
clinical isolates were predominantly associated with virulence.
Additionally, the functions of genes differentially distributed in the
environment were significantly more diverse compared to those in
clinical settings. Analysis of mobile genetic elements suggested that
environmental isolates harbor more mobile genetic elements, implying a
potential for an increased number of resistance genes. The pathogenic
characteristics of the strains examined in this study, genomic diversity
and variation in mobile genetic elements are highly significant for
deepening our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of V.
parahaemolyticus and for the development of strategies to prevent its
infections.</p>

inhibits IL-1β release during Salmonella Typhimurium infection of
macrophages</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Macrophages are critical for the innate immune defense against the
facultative intracellular Gram-negative bacterium Salmoenterica serovar
Typhimurium. Following phagocytosis by macrophages, S. Typhimurium
activates cytoplasmic NLRC3 and NLRP4 inflammasomes, which share the
adaptor ASC, resulting in the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine
IL-1β. To prevent excessive inflammation and tissue damage, inflammatory
signaling pathways are tightly controlled. Recently, autophagy has been
suggested to limit inflammation by targeting activated inflammasomes for
autophagic degradation. However, the importance of the autophagic
adaptor Sequestome-1 (hereafter, p62) for regulating inflammasome
activation remains poorly understood. We report here that p62 restricts
inflammasome availability and subsequent IL-1β secretion in macrophages
infected with S. Typhimurium by targeting the inflammasome adaptor ASC
for autophagic degradation. Importantly, loss of p62 resulted in
impaired autophagy and increased IL-1β secretion, as well as IL-10 and
IFN-β release. In summary, our results demonstrate a novel role for p62
in inducing autophagy and balancing major pro- and anti-inflammatory
signaling pathways to prevent excessive inflammation during S.
Typhimurium infection of macrophages.</p>

mini review of the pathogenesis of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic
heart disease</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is an autoimmune disease caused by group
A streptococcal infection. Recurrent episodes of ARF can lead to
rheumatic heart disease (RHD), which is the leading cause of
cardiovascular mortality in children worldwide, especially in low- and
middle-income countries. Investigations into the etiology of ARF and RHD
constitute a crucial milestone in the advancement of both preventive
measures and therapeutic interventions. The purpose of this mini review
is to delineate the etiology and pathophysiological mechanisms
underlying ARF and RHD. Selective searches were conducted in PubMed to
retrieve literature published between 1968 and 2024, employing key terms
such as “acute rheumatic fever”, “rheumatic heart disease”, “group A
Streptococcus”, “streptococcal pharyngitis”, “pathogenesis”, and
“pathophysiology”. The pathogenesis of infections caused by group A
streptococci, and their effects on ARF and RHD, have been thoroughly
examined. A central hypothesis is that autoimmune responses are
triggered by molecular mimicry, but alternate pathogenic mechanisms are
continuously being explored. There is an urgent need for high-quality
research that can inform efforts aimed at decreasing the occurrence of
ARF and halting the advancement of RHD, which requires researchers to
understand its causes and to develop appropriate preventive and
therapeutic programs.</p>

detection of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical
isolates for first-line antitubercular drugs by using a novel reporter
mycobacteriophage</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The emergence of drug resistance presents a major challenge for the
treatment of tuberculosis (TB). Reporter phage can provide an effective
method for drug susceptibility testing (DST) of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb), but limited for parts of antitubercular drugs and
the process of operation is usually time-consuming. Herein, we developed
a new, sensitive, reporter phage with optimized method to detect drug
susceptibility of Mtb clinical isolates for all first-line
antitubercular drugs. The PfurAma promoter and nanoluciferase (Nluc)
reporter sequences were integrated into the genome of the TM4
mycobacteriophage to generate a reporter phage, designated φFN. By
optimizing concentration of Mtb, Tween 80 and drugs, we have established
an efficient workflow for φFN-based DST of Mtb that provides results for
four first-line antitubercular drugs within 72 hours. A total of 71
clinical isolates were tested and yielded significant relative
luminescent units (RLUs), and their resistance to rifampin (RIF),
isoniazid (INH), streptomycin (STR), and EMB were compared to the
conventional DST by MGIT 960. The comparative sensitivities of φFN DST
detection were 100%, 93.9%, 97.2%, and 81.3%, respectively; and the
relative specificities were 98.1%, 97.4%, 97.1%, and 96.4%,
respectively. The remaining luminescence rate (RLR) in the φFN DST assay
showed correlation with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The φFN
DST assay provides an efficient phage-based workflow to detect
drug-resistant Mtb for four first-line antitubercular drugs within 3
days.</p>

of mycoparasitic Trichoderma atroviride and entomopathogenic Aspergillus
niger as potential bioinsecticides against the dengue vector, Aedes
aegypti</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionOver the past three decades, dengue disease incidence has
significantly increased worldwide, creating serious public health
concerns. The principal mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, exhibits
resistance to commonly used insecticides, reducing the efficacy of
vector control measures. Thus, the necessity for alternate strategies is
critical. Using bioinsecticides such as entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) is
one such strategy. This study details the evaluation of mycoparasitic
Trichoderma atroviride and entomopathogenic Aspergillus niger against
pyrethroid-resistant and pyrethroid-susceptible Ae. aegypti
populations.Materials and methodsMolecular identification of the
isolated entomopathogenic fungal strains was done using ITS-rDNA
sequence data. Larvicidal and adulticidal assays were performed using
different spore concentrations of fungal species. Pupal emergence was
assessed from the survived larvae of larvicidal assays.ResultsLarvicidal
assays revealed the highest mortality of 60% for T. atroviride after 9
days of exposure when compared with the highest mortality of 52% for A.
niger after 6 days of exposure. No significant difference was observed
between the pyrethroid-resistant and pyrethroid-susceptible mosquito
colonies, suggesting a lack of connection between prior resistance
status and EPF pathogenicity. No pupal mortality was observed, although
pupal duration was prolonged. Both EPF strains exhibited 100% mortality
in adulticidal assays, signifying the potential use of the two fungal
species as adulticides.ConclusionHowever, further studies are needed to
understand the biology of EPF, its mechanism of action, the mosquito
immune pathways activated, and the effect on non-target organisms. The
findings have implications for the possible use of A. niger and T.
atroviride as potential bioinsecticides against the control of Ae.
aegypti.</p>

acetate mitigates later enhanced allergic airway inflammation in a
menopausal mouse model</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionAsthma, an inflammatory lung disease, disproportionately
affects women in adulthood and is associated with a decline in estrogen
levels during the menstrual cycle and menopause. To study asthma
symptoms during menopause, we used a mouse model of postmenopausal
asthma via ovariectomy (OVx). Similar to human menopause, we previously
discovered that re-exposure of allergic OVx mice to allergen exacerbates
lung inflammation. Surprisingly, we found that probiotic treatment
alleviates this inflammatory exacerbation and produces acetate as one of
its metabolites. Here, we investigate whether exogenous acetate alone
can inhibit the exacerbation of experimental asthma in
menopause.MethodsMice received acetate administration before and during
sensitization. After challenge and OVx the mice were subjected to a
second challenge to test whether acetate protected against airway
inflammation after menopause induction. ResultsAcetate administration
reduced all lung T2 inflammatory responses, as well as the serum
immunoglobulin (IgE) level. Early acetate treatment led to an increase
in regulatory T cells, even 3 weeks after cessation of the treatment,
suggesting that the increase in Treg percentage is associated with the
reduction of type 2 inflammation in the airways after menopause
induction, indicating its potential role in this process. Given the
significant role of the lung-gut axis in asthma and the association of
asthma and menopause with intestinal dysfunctions, this finding is
particularly relevant; we also analyzed several markers of intestinal
integrity. Compared with sham-operated mice, rechallenged allergic
menopausal mice had a reduction in the intestinal epithelial genes, MUC2
and OCLN, and preventive supplementation with acetate returned their
expression to normal. No change was found in menopausal mice without
allergic inflammation.ConclusionIn conclusion, treatment with acetate
prior to estrogen level decline protects sensitized and challenged mice
against later airway T2 inflammation and may restore gut
homeostasis.</p>

<p>date: 2025-04-10, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundHIV remains a major public health issue in spite of
antiretroviral therapy (ART). An innovative vaccine that can induce
long-lasting and effective immunity is required to curb the persistently
high numbers of new infections worldwide.MethodsA novel DNA vaccine was
generated using a Simian-Human Immunodeficiency Virus (SHIV) backbone
with a Zambian T/F clade C envelope and under the control of the caprine
arthritis encephalitis virus long terminal repeats (LTRs) for
constitutive expression. Due to the deleted integrase, this DNA vaccine
“CSH-DIN-T/F Z331” performs only a single replication cycle. To increase
immunogenicity, the co-expression of apoptotic genes (BAX, BAK, or
caspase 8) incorporated at the end of Pol was tested to promote the
release of apoptotic bodies taken up by dendritic cells leading to
cross-presentation of antigen. The three vaccines (CSH-DIN-T/F Z331-BAX,
CSH-DIN-T/F Z331-BAK, and CSH-DIN-T/F Z331-Cas8) were tested in vitro
for expression and in vivo in BALB/cJ mice for
immunogenicity.ResultsTransduced HEK293 cells co-cultured with CEMx174
confirmed the single replication cycle of the DNA vaccine and the
induction of apoptosis by CSH-DIN-T/F Z331-Cas8 based on Annexin V
expression. BALB/cJ mice were immunized with a combined intramuscular +
intradermal/electroporation approach. Intracellular cytokine staining
(ICS) from splenocytes collected 12 weeks post-prime/6 weeks post-boost
demonstrated a clear superiority of caspase 8 expressing construct over
the others, with higher proportions of IFN-γ-, IL-2-, and
IL-21-producing CD8 T cells specific to Env, Gag, and Nef. The kinetics
of immune response after various immunization schedules were also
investigated.ConclusionThis novel single-cycle DNA vaccine with
apoptotic genes demonstrated an enhanced immunogenicity primarily for
antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell responses.</p>

2 inhibitor AGK2 exerts antiviral effects by inducing epigenetic
suppression of hepatitis B virus covalently closed circular DNA through
recruitment of repressive histone lysine methyltransferases and
reduction of cccDNA</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection continues to be a global
health concern because current treatments such as interferon-α and
nucleos(t)ide analogs cannot fully eliminate the virus due to
persistence of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) and integrated
HBV DNA. Earlier research suggests that AGK2, a selective SIRT2
inhibitor, suppresses HBV replication by modifying key signaling
pathways. This study aimed to further explore the anti-HBV effects of
AKG2, particularly its effects on the epigenetic landscape of cccDNA.
HBV-transfected and -infected cells were used to assess the impact of
AGK2 on viral replication. Changes in SIRT2 expression and α-tubulin
acetylation (SDS-PAGE-immunoblotting), core particle formation (native
agarose gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting), HBV RNA (northern
blotting) and DNA (Southern blotting) synthesis, and cccDNA levels
(Southern blotting) were measured. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays
were performed to examine deposition of transcriptionally repressive
epigenetic markers on cccDNA. AGK2 reduced expression of SIRT2,
increased acetylated α-tubulin levels, and reduced synthesis of HBV RNA
and DNA. Importantly, AGK2 also reduced cccDNA levels and increased
deposition of repressive histone markers H4K20me1, H3K27me3, and H3K9me3
on cccDNA, mediated by histone lysine methyltransferases such as
PR-Set7, EZH2, SETDB1, and SUV39H1. Additionally, there was a reduction
in recruitment of RNA polymerase II and acetylated H3 to cccDNA,
indicating that AGK2 enhances transcriptional repression. AGK2
suppresses HBV replication through direct antiviral actions, and by
epigenetic modulation of cccDNA, indicating that using AGK2 to target
SIRT2 and associated epigenetic regulators shows promise as a functional
cure for chronic hepatitis B.</p>

epitope-based nanoparticles targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
enhanced the immune response and induced potential broad neutralizing
activity</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe ongoing COVID-19 has caused a global pandemic,
resulting in millions of infections and deaths. While current vaccines
target the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, its high mutation rate
significantly compromises vaccine efficacy. We aimed to evaluate the
potential of epitope-based nanoparticles (NPs) to induce broad
cross-protection and durable immune responses against
SARS-CoV-2.MethodsFour conserved epitopes derived from the
receptor-binding domain (RBD) and S2 subunit of the spike protein were
integrated into Helicobacter pylori ferritin to create epitope-based NPs
named S18-F, RBM-F, UH-F, and HR2-F. The immunogenicity of the
epitope-based NPs was evaluated through animal experiments to measure
epitope-specific antibody titers and assess neutralizing activity
against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. To characterize cellular immune
responses, splenic lymphocyte proliferation following epitope
stimulation was measured, and cytokine secretion profiles including
IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10 were analyzed to determine Th1/Th2 immune
polarization. Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assays
were performed to evaluate NP-enhanced recognition and elimination of
infected target cells.ResultsThese NPs induced high titers of
epitope-specific antibodies lasting three months post-immunization. Sera
from the RBM-F, UH-F, and HR2-F groups exhibited neutralizing activity
against the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus WH-1 in vitro. Splenic lymphocytes
from the S18-F, RBM-F, and UH-F groups showed significantly increased
proliferation. Lymphocytes from the RBM-F group demonstrated increased
secretion of IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10 cytokines, indicating a
balanced Th1 and Th2 immune response. Immune sera from the S18-F and
mixed-immunized groups exhibited antibody-dependent cellular
cytotoxicity.DiscussionThe results indicate that these NPs induce robust
humoral and cellular immune responses, potentially offering a promising
strategy for effective vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2.</p>

microbiota and intestinal immunity interaction in ulcerative colitis and
its application in treatment</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-09, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, non-specific inflammatory bowel
disease characterized by inflammation and injury of the colonic mucosa,
exhibiting an increasing global incidence. Although research into UC
pathogenesis is ongoing, the precise mechanisms remain to be fully
elucidated. Studies indicate that UC development results from a complex
interplay of factors, including genetic predisposition, environmental
exposures, gut microbial dysbiosis, and immune dysregulation.
Specifically, UC pathogenesis involves aberrant immune responses
triggered by interactions between the host and gut microbiota. A
complex, dynamic relationship exists between the microbial community and
the host immune system throughout UC pathogenesis. Accumulating evidence
suggests that changes in microbiota composition significantly impact gut
immunity. This review will examine the intricate balance between the gut
microbiota and mucosal immunity in UC progression and discuss potential
therapeutic applications, providing a reference for further clinical
treatment of this patient population.</p>

retrospective analysis comparing metagenomic next-generation sequencing
with conventional microbiology testing for the identification of
pathogens in patients with severe infections</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-08, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionThe application value of metagenomic next-generation
sequencing (mNGS) in detecting pathogenic bacteria was evaluated to
promote the rational and accurate use of antibiotics. A total of 180
patients with severe infections were included in this study.MethodsBased
on their different symptoms, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) or
blood samples were collected for conventional microbiological testing
(CMT) and mNGS.ResultsThe results indicated that the etiological
diagnosis rate of mNGS (78.89%) was significantly higher than that of
CMT (20%) (p&lt;0.001). Notably, mNGS exhibited greater sensitivity
towards rare pathogens such as Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycobacterium
tuberculosis complex, and Legionella pneumophila, which were
undetectable by CMT. Additionally, 64 cases underwent blood culture,
BALF culture, and mNGS testing. Analysis revealed that the positive rate
of blood culture (3.1%) was lower than that of BALF (25%), and the
positive rate of CMT from both types was significantly lower than that
of mNGS (89.1%) (p&lt;0.001). In this study, 168 mNGS results were
accepted, and 116 patients had their antibiotic therapy adjustment based
on mNGS. Paired analysis indicated that white blood cell count (WBC),
procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), and neutrophil (NEU)
percentage provided valuable therapeutic guidance. The survival rate of
patients was 55.36%, influenced by patient physical condition and
age.DiscussionOur data indicated that mNGS had significant auxiliary
value in the clinical diagnosis and treatment for critically ill
patients, especially for those with negative CMT results and clinically
undefined infections. mNGS could broaden the detection scope, especially
for special pathogens, and improve the detection rate, providing
powerful assistance for early clinical diagnosis and treatment.</p>

in children respiratory infections pre and post COVID-19 pandemic</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundNon-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) implemented during
the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the prevalence of
various acute respiratory infections (ARIs) pathogens.MethodsWe
collected 337,310 real-time PCR results for 13 pathogens from clinical
samples between January 2018 and January 2024 to assess the changes of
ARIs among children before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.ResultsA
variety of ARIs pathogens, including Influenza A (Flu A), Influenza B
(Flu B), Adenovirus (ADV), Rhinovirus (RhV), and Respiratory Syncytial
Virus (RSV), as well as co-infecting bacterial such as Klebsiella
pneumoniae (KPN), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAE), Streptococcus pneumoniae
(SP), Haemophilus influenzae (HI), and Listeria monocytogenes (LP),
reached a peak positive rate at the age of 3. The susceptible age of
Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) was from 3 to 7 years old. Compared to the
pre-COVID pandemic period, the positive rates of Flu A, MP, ADV, SP, HI,
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and KPN decreased during the COVID-19
pandemic. And the positive rates of Flu B and PAE increased. Compared to
the period during the COVID-19 pandemic, the positive rates of Flu A,
ADV, RSV, RhV, SP, HI, KPN, PAE and SA were increased after the
pandemic. Conversely, the positive rates of MP, Flu B, and Parainfluenza
virus (PIV) decreased.ConclusionsThe implementation of NPIs interrupted
the circulation of ARIs pathogens. However, release of NPIs and the
reduced baseline of population immunity, may contribute to a resurgence
of ARIs pathogens among children.</p>

Fusobacterium nucleatum exacerbates ulcerative colitis via the oral-gut
axis: mechanisms and therapeutic implications</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundFusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) is an anaerobic
bacterium known for its association with periodontal disease and oral
infections. It has been implicated in the development of
gastrointestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and
colorectal cancer. Ulcerative colitis (UC), which is characterized by
chronic inflammation of the colon, is a condition of unknown etiology
with a rising incidence rate, significantly affecting the quality of
life for patients. The increased intestinal permeability during UC may
facilitate the adherence or invasion of F. nucleatum into the damaged
intestinal barrier, leading to exacerbated inflammation.MethodsThis
article introduces the concept of the oral-gut axis, reviewing existing
literature to analyze the role of F. nucleatum in the pathogenesis of UC
and exploring its potential pathogenic mechanisms. It also summarizes
the latest advances in treating patients with UC who have F. nucleatum
and looks forward to prospective therapeutic strategies and the
translational prospects of F. nucleatum within the oral-gut
axis.ResultsF. nucleatum may be a key player in the pathogenesis of UC,
likely due to its invasiveness during periods of increased intestinal
permeability. The paper also discusses innovative approaches for the
prevention and management of UC exacerbated by F. nucleatum, paving the
way for more effective treatment of UC.ConclusionThe review offers new
insights into the complex relationship between the oral microbiome and
intestinal diseases, enhancing our understanding of their dynamic
interactions. There is a paucity of literature on therapeutic
approaches, indicating a need for further clinical research.</p>

exposure alters the diversity and composition of oral microbiome</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionAlcohol exposure has been shown to have complex, and
sometimes paradoxical, associations with various serious diseases.
Currently, there is no knowledge about the effects of alcohol exposure
on the dynamics of oral microbial communities.ObjectiveThe study aims to
investigate the effects of chronic alcohol consumption on the diversity
and composition dynamics of the rat oral microbiota using 16S rRNA gene
amplicon sequencing.MethodsIn our study, there were 2 groups, including
a control group (C group) and an alcohol group (A group), with 10 rats
in every group. For ten weeks, rats in the A group were treated with
alcohol intragastrically every day, whereas rats in the C group got
water. After 10 weeks, serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were measured. Oral swabs were
taken from both groups, and total DNA was extracted for high-throughput
sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene.ResultsAccording to the results obtained
from our study, significant differences were observed in the relative
abundances of microbial communities. Alpha diversity measures were
statistically significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) in the A group compared
to the C group. At the genus level, alcohol exposure altered the
relative abundance of several microbes, including increased relative
abundance of unidentified_Chloroplast, Acinetobacter, Vibrio,
Romboutsia, Pseudoalteromonas, Aeromonas, Ralstonia, Turicibacter,
Shewanella, and Bacteroides. Conversely, Haemophilus and Streptococcus
were significantly less abundant in the A group.ConclusionAlcohol
exposure was associated with the diversity and composition of the oral
microbiome. These findings contribute to our understanding of the
potential role of oral bacteria in alcohol-related oral and systemic
diseases, providing foundational work for future prevention and
intervention studies.</p>

Granule on patients with persistent HPV infection</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Jiawei Ermiao Granule (JWEMG) is a traditional Chinese herbal
formulation widely used in China for the treatment of human papilloma
virus (HPV) infections. However, the mechanisms underlying their
efficacy in clearing HPV infections remain unclear. This study aimed to
elucidate the mechanisms by which JWEMG clears persistent HPV infections
from a metabolomics perspective using modern analytical techniques.
Untargeted and targeted metabolomics analyses were performed on vaginal
lavage samples from 33 patients using liquid chromatograph mass
spectrometer (LC-MS) and hydrophilic interaction liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS). Untargeted metabolomics
identified 47 potential biomarkers through volcano plot analysis, among
which 30 exhibited a reversal trend following JWEMG intervention. Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis suggested that
JWEMG may exert therapeutic effects on patients with persistent HPV
infections via pathways related to starch and sucrose metabolism,
galactose metabolism, fructose and mannose metabolism, and amino sugar
and nucleotide sugar metabolism. Targeted metabolomics revealed a
significant increase in tyrosine levels in the vaginal/cervical
microenvironment following JWEMG treatment. By integrating targeted and
untargeted metabolomics, this study provides a comprehensive exploration
of the holistic effects of JWEMG on HPV-infected patients, addressing
the challenges of scientifically explaining the pharmacological
mechanisms of multi-component, multi-target traditional Chinese
medicines.</p>

phenotypes and genomic features of Mycobacterium seoulense isolates</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundMycobacterium seoulense (M. seoulense) is an emerging
pathogen increasingly associated with infections; however, its
resistance phenotypes and genomic characteristics remain largely
unknown.MethodsSeven M. seoulense isolates were collected from clinical
samples. Drug susceptibility testing was conducted using Sensititre™
SLOMYCO2 susceptibility plates. Whole genome sequencing and supporting
bioinformatics analyses were performed to analyze the genomic
features.ResultsAll M. seoulense isolates (n=7) exhibited growth on 7H10
agar medium containing thiophenecarboxylic acid hydrazide or
p-Nitrobenzoic acid, with marked diversity in growth rates in liquid
culture. All strains exhibited high minimum inhibitor concentrations
(MICs) for minocycline (&gt;8 μg/mL), doxycycline (&gt;8 μg/mL), and
amikacin (16-32 μg/mL). The MICs for linezolid, rifabutin, moxifloxacin,
ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, clarithromycin, and rifampicin varied among
the isolates. High levels of genomic diversity were noted among these
strains concerning genome-called single nucleotide polymorphisms and
average nucleotide identity. In total, 4,282 genes were shared across
all genomes, while 315 unique genes were restricted to one strain.
Comparative genomic analysis identified two unique virulence genes
encoding a catalase enzyme and a protein involved in capsule
biosynthesis and transport. Additionally, all M. seoulense strains
demonstrated the ability to survive within macrophages.ConclusionThe
clinical M. seoulense isolates analyzed in this study exhibited varying
levels of antibiotic susceptibility, suggesting the potential need for
susceptibility testing to guide clinical treatment. Genomic features of
these isolates indicated that they are likely pathogenic non-tuberculous
mycobacterium, highlighting a need for closer epidemiological
monitoring.</p>

and characterization of bile microbiota in patients with biliary
obstructive diseases using next-generation sequencing of 16S rRNA and
ITS</h2>
<p>date: 2025-04-07, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundComparative studies of the bile microbiota in different
biliary obstructive infections remain limited. This study aims to
characterize bile microbiota and investigate differences in microbial
profiles across various biliary obstructive diseases.MethodsThis study
included patients with biliary obstructive diseases admitted to Jinling
Hospital and Suqian First Hospital. The cohort consisted of individuals
with benign biliary disorders, malignant biliary obstruction, and
biliary obstruction secondary to severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) or
intestinal fistulas. A total of 133 bile samples were collected from 118
patients and analyzed using next-generation sequencing (NGS) targeting
the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and the fungal internal transcribed spacer
(ITS) gene. Clinical data, including routine culture results, were
extracted from electronic medical records.ResultsNGS targeting the 16S
rRNA and ITS revealed a positive rate of 68.42% for bile samples, which
was higher than the culture positivity rate of 60.15%, indicating a
significant difference (Chi-square test, p &lt; 0.05). The predominant
bacteria identified in the bile samples through NGS were Klebsiella
pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Escherichia coli. Bacterial
species varied among benign biliary diseases, malignant obstructive
diseases, and biliary obstruction caused by SAP or intestinal fistulas.
Fungi were detected in 7.52% (10/133) of the samples, with 4 samples
obtained from patients with biliary obstructive diseases due to SAP.
Microbial diversity and clustering analysis showed no significant
differences among various biliary disorders. Based on the culture
results, the sensitivity and specificity of NGS were 81.82% and 69.64%,
respectively.ConclusionThe composition of bile microbes may be related
to the etiology of biliary obstruction. Klebsiella pneumoniae,
Acinetobacter baumannii, and Escherichia coli are the predominant
bacteria found in bile. NGS can be effectively applied for the
identification and characterization of bile microbes associated with
various biliary obstruction diseases.</p>
