Mesoscale Discussion 0222
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0628 AM CDT Sun Mar 16 2025

Areas affected...North Florida and southeast Georgia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch likely 

Valid 161128Z - 161300Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...80 percent

SUMMARY...A broken band of storms will spread eastward into
southeast Georgia and north Florida through late morning.  A new
tornado watch appears likely.

DISCUSSION...A broken band of storms has persisted overnight from
south central GA into the eastern FL Panhandle, with
occasional/embedded supercell structures.  Low-level moistening over
the next few hours and the onset of diurnal heating will drive
destabilization across north FL/southeast GA later this morning. 
Though the low-level jet core will develop northeastward toward the
Carolinas through the day, low-level flow/shear will remain
sufficiently strong to support additional supercells through the
morning across north FL/southeast GA.  The storms will remain
capable of producing occasional damaging winds and possibly a couple
of tornadoes, and a new tornado watch will likely be needed from
12-13z.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook CORR 1
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0748 AM CDT Sun Mar 16 2025

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

CORRECTED FOR CRITICAL HEADLINE

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR MUCH OF THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS
INTO PARTS OF SOUTHEAST COLORADO AND SOUTHWEST KANSAS...

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will return to the southern and central Plains
on Monday as a dry return flow regime becomes established across the
central CONUS. A surface low is forecast to deepen along the
northern High Plains before migrating into the northern Plains
through the day Monday. As this occurs, a strong low-level mass
response will induce breezy southerly winds from TX into the central
Plains. A recent frontal passage into the northern Gulf has degraded
moisture quality along the TX coast with persistent offshore flow
expected for the next 24 hours. Consequently, moisture return into
the Plains on Monday is expected to be limited and will allow for RH
reductions into the teens to mid 20s as temperatures climb into the
60s and 70s. A surface high shifting into the Southeast by Monday
afternoon will support strong pressure gradient winds across NM and
western TX/OK with a high probability for a large swath of sustained
winds over 20 mph. Fire weather concerns are expected to be greatest
across this region given recent fire activity and expected RH
reductions into the low teens and single digits. Further north into
the central High Plains, closer proximity to the surface trough/low
will likely result in sustained winds closer to 15-20 mph. While
weaker, these will still be sufficient to pose a widespread fire
weather risk given receptive fine fuels over the region. 

Both the Critical and Elevated fire weather risk areas were expanded
east compared to the previous forecast to take into account the
typical bias in guidance to under-mix the boundary layer in these
regimes (which typically results in drier/windier conditions than
otherwise expected). Additional uncertainties include the
east/northeast extent of the fire weather risk given recent
precipitation across parts of the MO River Valley. Fuel trends will
be monitored and further expansions may be needed depending on fuel
trends.

Valid 161300Z - 171200Z

...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR WESTERN
INTO CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA...

...SUMMARY...
Sporadic damaging wind swaths and a few tornadoes will be the
primary threats this morning through dusk across a broad portion of
the East.

...OH Valley/northern Middle Atlantic...
Water-vapor imagery this morning shows an upper trough over the MS
Valley with an embedded mid-level vorticity maximum rotating
northeastward over the lower OH Valley.  This mid-level feature will
be accompanied by an intense belt of flow (110+ kt at 500 mb)
shifting eastward across the upper OH Valley/central Appalachians
through the day.  In the low levels, a surface low over southeast
Lower MI will develop northward reaching the Quebec/Ontario border
by late afternoon.  A moist/weakly unstable warm sector to the
southeast of the low will only slightly destabilize through peak
heating.  Yet, short-term model guidance indicates 200-500 J/kg
MLCAPE will develop later this morning across the central
Appalachians into the eastern OH/western PA border region.  A
strongly forced band of convection is forecast to gradually evolve
over the upper OH Valley.  Largely unidirectional southerly flow and
elongated hodographs will support a risk for scattered damaging
gusts (55-70 mph) and perhaps a couple of brief tornadoes with this
activity.  The area of greatest model agreement for a convective
line posing a risk for severe appears most likely/concentrated
across western into central parts of PA.  Farther south, gradual
intensification of convection within a weakly unstable airmass will
support a risk for damaging gusts and perhaps a tornado or two
through early evening.  

...Southeast...
The southern portion of a mid-level trough will continue east
through the lower MS Valley into the Southeast today, as a low-level
jet steadily shifts east across north FL through much of SC by
mid-late afternoon while gradually weakening south of North
Carolina.  An ongoing broken band of pre-frontal strong to severe
thunderstorms will move east into a weakly unstable airmass
(reference the 12 UTC Charleston, SC raob).  Prior to a gradual
weakening of 850-mb flow by early to mid afternoon, adequately
enlarged hodographs within a destabilizing airmass (1000-1500 J/kg
MLCAPE across north-central FL with considerably weaker instability
over the coastal Carolinas) will support organized storms, including
line segments (mainly north) and some supercells (south).  Scattered
damaging gusts (55-70 mph) and a couple of tornadoes are possible as
the severe threat shifts east through the period.

Day 4-8 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0356 AM CDT Sun Mar 16 2025

Valid 191200Z - 241200Z

...DISCUSSION...
...Wednesday/Day 4 to Friday/Day 6...
A mid-level trough is forecast to move northeastward into the upper
Mississippi Valley on Wednesday. Ahead of the trough, a narrow axis
of moisture and weak instability is forecast from the western Great
Lakes into the lower Ohio Valley. This corridor of low-level
moisture will be the favored location for convective development
Wednesday afternoon. Surface dewpoints along the moist axis are only
expected to be in the 40s to lower 50s F. In spite of this, the exit
region of the mid-level jet is forecast to overspread the region
during the mid to late afternoon. This will provide strong lift and
deep-layer shear, sufficient for an isolated severe threat. Any
severe threat should remain marginal.

On Thursday, the trough is forecast move eastward through the Ohio
and Tennessee Valleys, as a cold front advances to near the Atlantic
Seaboard, from the eastern Carolinas into the Mid-Atlantic. Isolated
severe storms will again be possible along or ahead of the front
during the mid to late afternoon, but any threat is expected to be
marginal.

On Friday, a mid-level trough is forecast to move eastward into the
central states, where isolated convection will be possible. However,
moisture return is expected to be confined to the Texas Coastal
Plain, which will be a severe threat limiting factor.

...Saturday/Day 7 and Sunday/Day 8...
On Saturday, the trough is forecast to de-amplify and move into the
northeastern U.S. as a broad low-amplitude cyclonic flow pattern
develops over much of the U.S. Moisture return is expected to take
place over the western Gulf Coast on Saturday and across the
southern Plains on Sunday. Some models suggest that a trough will
take shape in the Great Plains on Sunday, with a cluster of storms
forming ahead of the system Sunday afternoon. These storms would
develop along the northern edge of the stronger instability from
Oklahoma into Arkansas, expanding Sunday evening across the lower to
mid Mississippi Valley. If this scenario where to verify, then a
severe threat would be possible with the stronger storms within the
MCS. However, at this extended range, the magnitude and spatial
extent of any severe threat remains considerably uncertain.

Mesoscale Discussion 0196
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0747 AM CDT Sat Mar 15 2025

Areas affected...portions of western Minnesota

Concerning...Heavy snow 

Valid 151247Z - 151645Z

SUMMARY...Periods of heavy snow (perhaps exceeding 1 inch/hr at
times), along with blizzard conditions are possible this morning.
Winds may sustain over 35 mph (with higher gusts), with reduced
visibility possible in spots.

DISCUSSION...A stacked cyclone continues to occlude while drifting
toward Ontario. As this cyclone continues to track northward,
continued CAA will keep the column below freezing while 850-700 mb
frontogenesis will continue to support adequate convergence/lift for
efficient dendrite production over central MN, which will pivot
around the northwestern quadrant of the cyclone and support moderate
to heavy snowfall over western MN this morning. Strong surface
isallobaric flow across the northwestern cyclone quadrant may
coincide with heavier snowfall rates (perhaps exceeding 1 inch/hr at
times), resulting in periodic blizzard conditions. Visibility may
reduce to or less than a quarter mile in the heavier snow bands.

Mesoscale Discussion 0195
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0719 AM CDT Sat Mar 15 2025

Areas affected...portions of northeastern Kentucky...southern and
central Ohio...and extreme western West Virginia

Concerning...Severe potential...Watch unlikely 

Valid 151219Z - 151345Z

Probability of Watch Issuance...20 percent

SUMMARY...A few instances of severe hail or damaging gusts may
continue for a few more hours. The overall severe threat appears
isolated and a downstream WW issuance is not currently anticipated.

DISCUSSION...A line of thunderstorms with a history of severe hail
and damaging gusts (some of which have exceeded severe limits)
continues to progress eastward as a stacked cyclone over the Great
Lakes continues to track toward Ontario. This line of storms
(especially the southern portion) continues to effectively transport
stronger flow aloft to the surface, with 7-8 C/km mid-level lapse
rates likely supporting continuing severe hail production. However,
this line of storms is approaching the eastern bounds of what is
already scant buoyancy (characterized by 200 J/kg MUCAPE per the 12Z
ILN observed sounding), and this line should gradually outpace this
marginal instability with time. As such, the severe threat should
generally remain limited, though a focused severe threat may
continue with the more robust storms (southern portion of the line
in KY) for at least a few more hours.

* Primary threats include...
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter possible
  Scattered damaging wind gusts to 70 mph possible
  A tornado or two possible

SUMMARY...Widely scattered to scattered storms are forecast to
continue to develop and intensify overnight into the morning across
the Watch area.  The stronger storms will be supercells capable of a
large-hail and damaging-wind risk.  A tornado cannot be ruled out as
storms approach the Sabine River during the morning.

The severe thunderstorm watch area is approximately along and 75
statute miles north and south of a line from 55 miles west southwest
of College Station TX to 50 miles east southeast of Longview TX. For
a complete depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline
update (WOUS64 KWNS WOU3).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Severe Thunderstorm Watch means conditions are
favorable for severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.
Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for threatening
weather conditions and listen for later statements and possible
warnings. Severe thunderstorms can and occasionally do produce
tornadoes.

&&

OTHER WATCH INFORMATION...CONTINUE...WW 36...WW 37...WW 38...WW
40...WW 41...WW 42...

AVIATION...A few severe thunderstorms with hail surface and aloft to
2.5 inches. Extreme turbulence and surface wind gusts to 60 knots. A
few cumulonimbi with maximum tops to 500. Mean storm motion vector
24040.

  A few tornadoes and a couple intense tornadoes likely
  Scattered damaging winds and isolated significant gusts to 75
    mph likely
  Scattered large hail and isolated very large hail events to 2.5
    inches in diameter likely

SUMMARY...Thunderstorms will increase in coverage and intensity in
an extensive band from northern Louisiana to southeast Arkansas,
northern Mississippi and southwest Tennessee through the morning. 
The storm environment will become more favorable for tornadic
supercells with time, including the potential for a few strong
(EF2-EF3) tornadoes later this morning.  Otherwise, large hail of
1.5-2.5 inches in diameter and thunderstorm gusts of 60-75 mph will
also be possible.

The tornado watch area is approximately along and 65 statute miles
north and south of a line from 45 miles west northwest of
Natchitoches LA to 35 miles northeast of Tupelo MS. For a complete
depiction of the watch see the associated watch outline update
(WOUS64 KWNS WOU4).

PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS...

REMEMBER...A Tornado Watch means conditions are favorable for
tornadoes and severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch
area. Persons in these areas should be on the lookout for
threatening weather conditions and listen for later statements
and possible warnings.
