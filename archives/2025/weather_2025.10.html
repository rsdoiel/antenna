Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0743 AM CDT Thu Mar 13 2025

Valid 131300Z - 141200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM NORTHEAST
MISSISSIPPI SOUTHEAST ACROSS ALABAMA AND INTO THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE
AND WESTERN GEORGIA...

...SUMMARY...
A few severe thunderstorms producing hail and locally damaging gusts
are possible from eastern Mississippi into Alabama, western Georgia,
and parts of the Florida Panhandle today.

...Synopsis...
Water-vapor imagery this morning shows a convectively enhanced
mid-level vorticity max near the AR/TN/MS border and located within
a larger mid-level trough centered over the lower MS Valley.  The
mid-level trough will move southeast over the FL Peninsula by mid
evening with the strongest accompanying belt of mid-level flow
shifting into the northern and eastern parts of the Gulf.  Farther
west, a mid-level ridge will move east across the Great Plains into
the MS Valley as an intensifying trough quickly moves east across
southern CA to the southern High Plains during the period.  A cold
front will push east across the lower CO Valley and Sonoran Desert.

...Northwest Mississippi, Central/Southern Alabama, western Georgia
and the western Florida Panhandle...
South-southwesterly low-level flow this morning is acting to advect
modestly more moisture (950-925 mb layer) into the region this
morning (reference 12 UTC Jackson, Birmingham, and Slidell, LA
raobs).  This moisture is beneath the eastern fringe of an elevated
mixed layer that features steep 700-500 mb lapse rates (7.5 to 8.5
deg C/km per raob data).  Ongoing cluster of showers/storms over
northern MS will probably slowly develop southeast through midday. 
Ample heating to the south/southwest of northwest to
southeast-oriented surface trough will contribute to MLCAPE around
500-1000 J/kg.  As the zone of ascent overspreads the destabilizing
airmass across AL into GA/FL, additional storms are forecast this
afternoon.  Isolated to scattered storm coverage is forecast and a
few of the stronger storms will potentially yield an isolated threat
for severe.  This activity will likely weaken by evening owing to
the loss of heating and departing large-scale ascent.

...Southern Arizona...
As a cold front progresses across southern Arizona, shower and
thunderstorm activity is expected to spread across the region. Flow
aloft will be quite strong, as a 100 kt jet max digs southward
across the Mexico border.  It is possible some higher momentum flow
may mix down to the surface at times for a gust to approach severe
limits within convection.  Overall, the weak thermal profile would
suggest the severe threat will remain low.

...DISCUSSION...
...Day 4/Sun - Eastern U.S....

A large-scale upper trough near the MS Valley Sunday morning will
develop east to the Appalachians by early Monday. Strong deep-layer
south/southwesterly flow on the eastern side of the upper trough
will overspread much of the eastern U.S. Convection will likely be
ongoing Sunday morning from the Upper OH Valley into GA and northern
FL. This activity will move into a moist airmass, characterized by
60s F dewpoints from north FL toward the Chesapeake Bay vicinity
(50s F dewpoints further north into PA/NJ). Instability will be
greatest where deeper boundary layer moisture is forecast, but given
intense deep-layer flow, organized convection is expected with even
very modest instability. While linear convection producing damaging
gusts will be the main hazard for much of the region, tornado
potential will exist where sufficient boundary layer moisture
exists, most likely from the Carolinas southward. 

...Days 6-7/Tue-Wed - OK/KS into the MS/OH/TN Valleys...

Another large-scale upper trough is forecast to move across the West
and into the Plains on Tuesday into early Wednesday, and then into
the Midwest by Thursday. This will bring some potential for severe
storms. However, a prior cold frontal intrusion deep into the Gulf
and surface high pressure east of the MS River in the wake of the
Day 4/Sun upper trough will limit moisture return into the
southern/central Plains on Tuesday. Modest moisture return is
possible further southeast on Wednesday, but forecast guidance
currently is unremarkable. Trends will be monitored, but the
probability for any more an isolated/marginal severe appears low at
this time.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0200 AM CDT Thu Mar 13 2025

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHWEST
TEXAS THROUGH MUCH OF OKLAHOMA INTO EXTREME SOUTHEASTERN KANSAS...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR MUCH OF THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS
INTO THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
---Significant, dangerous wildfire-spread conditions expected, with
a wildfire outbreak possible across parts of the Southern Plains
tomorrow (Friday)---

A powerful mid-level trough and associated 100+ kt 500 mb jet streak
will overspread the southern Plains tomorrow (Friday) afternoon,
supporting rapid deepening of an intense surface cyclone over
Kansas. Diurnal heating and associated deepening/mixing of the
boundary layer will support the downward momentum transport of very
strong winds aloft. This stronger channeled flow aloft, in tandem
with a strong isallobaric-driven component of surface flow, will
support an intense, damaging surface wind field across the southern
High Plains. The overlapping of this intense wind field with a very
dry low-level airmass across the southern Plains, overspreading dry
fuels, will encourage dangerous wildfire-spread conditions for
several hours Friday afternoon.

...Southern Plains...
By 18Z, the 100+ kt mid-level jet streak will overspread central
Oklahoma as the surface low strengthens to around 980 mb. As the
dryline surges eastward across the Southern Plains, 20-30 mph
sustained westerly surface winds and 10-20 percent RH will become
common across eastern New Mexico into much of Texas, nearly all of
Oklahoma, and central into eastern Kansas, where broad Critical
highlights have been introduced.

Of particular concern is that a belt of 35-45 mph sustained westerly
surface winds should develop across a sizeable region of northern
Texas into Oklahoma and far southern Kansas beneath the 500 mb jet
max. RH may lower to 10 percent within this belt of intense surface
winds, and gusts may reach 60 mph in spots. With fuels being at
least modestly to highly receptive to fire spread, the volatile
combination of surface winds/RH overspreading these fuels may
promote rapid wildfire spread/extreme fire behavior, and a wildfire
outbreak is possible. Much of this region has experienced meaningful
rainfall over the past week or so, and some guidance hints at RH
only dipping to around 25-30 percent in spots. Even so, the
anomalously strong wind field should compensate to support dangerous
wildfire-spread conditions, warranting the introduction of Extremely
Critical highlights.
