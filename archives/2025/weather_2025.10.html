Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0725 AM CDT Mon Mar 10 2025

Valid 101300Z - 111200Z

...THERE IS A MARGINAL RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR NORTHERN AND
CENTRAL PORTIONS OF THE FLORIDA PENINSULA...

...SUMMARY...
Thunderstorms associated with an isolated risk for severe gusts, and
potentially a tornado, will be possible through early afternoon in
parts of north and central Florida.

...FL Peninsula...
Morning satellite/radar analysis shows a mid-level trough over AL/MS
moving east-southeast towards FL, while a broken band of pre-frontal
showers/storms extends from parts of north FL south-southwestward
into the eastern Gulf west of Fort Myers.  The mid-level trough will
move over the Peninsula by early evening.  A cold front is forecast
to push southeast across the northern and central portions of the
Peninsula through mid afternoon and coincide with thunderstorm
development pushing east of the FL east coast.  In the meantime,
moist/southerly low-level flow will maintain a reservoir of moderate
buoyancy (1200 J/kg MLCAPE per the 12 UTC Tampa Bay raob).  Strong
mid- to high-level flow will aid in storm organization contingent on
adequately strong/sustained updraft development.  An isolated threat
for locally strong to severe thunderstorms will seemingly exist
prior to storms exiting the east coast later this afternoon.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0151 AM CDT Mon Mar 10 2025

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EXTREME SOUTHEAST ARIZONA INTO
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough over the eastern Pacific will rapidly approach
the CONUS and impinge on the Desert Southwest tomorrow (Tuesday),
encouraging surface low development across the southern Plains. As
this occurs, dry downslope flow from the southern Rockies will
overspread portions of the southern High Plains, promoting
wildfire-spread potential. By afternoon peak heating,
west-southwesterly surface winds in the 15-25 mph range will become
common, along with RH dipping to 5-15 percent. Critical fire weather
highlights have been introduced where guidance consensus shows 20+
mph sustained surface winds overlapping with 10 percent RH for at
least a few hours Tuesday afternoon.
