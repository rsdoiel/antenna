Day 1 Convective Outlook  
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0720 AM CDT Fri Mar 14 2025

Valid 141300Z - 151200Z

...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
MID-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND PORTIONS OF THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY AND MID
SOUTH...

...SUMMARY...
A regional outbreak of severe storms is likely across the
Mid-Mississippi Valley to the Lower-Mississippi Valley, including
portions of the Lower Ohio Valley and Mid South.  Tornadoes, several
of which could be strong, widespread severe gusts ranging from 60 to
100 mph, and scattered large hail up to baseball size will be
possible.

...Synopsis...
Water-vapor satellite imagery shows a powerful negatively tilted mid
to upper-level shortwave trough over the Four Corners into the
southern High Plains.  A very intense 500-mb speed max in excess of
100+ kt will round the base of the trough and quickly move
northeastward across OK this afternoon and near Lake Michigan late
tonight.  The associated 12hr mid-level height falls (on the order
of 240-270m) will overspread portions of the central U.S. as a deep
cyclone develops northeast from the central High Plains into the
Upper Midwest.  In the low levels, a dryline will surge across the
central Plains eventually arcing from the low southeastward into the
Ozarks.  

Strong boundary-layer heating is forecast ahead of the cyclone and
initial storms will likely develop by early afternoon (18-20z) from
eastern NE southward into eastern KS/western MO.  Storms will
quickly grow upscale into a fast northeastward-moving band of storms
posing a risk for all hazards as this activity moves into IA and
towards the MO/IA/IL border region.  Intense thunderstorm
straight-line gusts peaking locally in the 80-100 mph range are
possible with the stronger cores/inflections in the band as it
matures and moves across the Mid MS Valley and eventually into the
southwestern Great Lakes tonight.  Have made some adjustments for
higher wind/tornado probabilities over northern IL eastward into the
Michiana region late tonight.  

Additional severe storms will develop southeast along the wind shift
into MO and within the northern periphery of richer low-level
moisture from southeast MO southward into eastern AR and into
northern MS/western TN.  Stronger high-level flow over the Mid South
will promote more discrete supercell structures.  Recent model
guidance indicates at least widely scattered storms developing
towards the evening as far south as the MS/AR/TN border region. 
Forecast soundings strongly favor intense supercells capable of
large to very large hail and potentially a few strong tornadoes this
evening and perhaps continuing into the late evening.  Forcing for
ascent will be more nebulous farther south into the Gulf coastal
plain late.  However, model guidance continues to suggest at least
isolated supercell development may occur within an increasingly rich
and weakly capped boundary layer overnight.  Have likewise extended
10-percent significant tornado probabilities farther south into
southern MS to account for this forecast scenario.  Moderate
buoyancy and enlarged hodographs will support a supercell tornado
risk with this activity with it perhaps continuing into early
Saturday morning.

...DISCUSSION...
...Monday/Day 4 to Wednesday/Day 6...
A broad anti-cyclonic flow pattern is forecast to develop across the
continental U.S. on Monday, as surface high pressure moves across
the southern and eastern U.S. On Tuesday into Wednesday, a mid-level
trough is forecast to move eastward across the western and central
U.S. Weak low-level moisture return is expected to take place across
the south-central U.S. ahead of the system. On Tuesday, thunderstorm
development appears most likely across eastern parts of the southern
and central Plains. By Wednesday, model forecasts have surface
dewpoints reaching the 50s F in parts of the lower Mississippi
Valley and Ark-La-Tex. Thunderstorms will be possible on Wednesday
along this corridor. As the system moves across the south-central
U.S. from Tuesday into Wednesday, a severe threat may develop.
However, medium-range model forecasts suggest that instability will
remain relatively weak, suggesting that any severe threat should be
isolated and marginal.

...Thursday/Day 7 and Friday/Day 8...
From Thursday into Friday, a mid-level trough is forecast to move
from the mid Mississippi Valley quickly eastward to the western
Atlantic. During the day on Thursday, thunderstorm development will
be possible ahead of the trough in parts of the eastern U.S. The
return of low-level moisture ahead of the system, and the resultant
instability, is forecast to remain relatively weak. For this reason,
any severe threat that develops on Thursday is expected to be
marginal.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN TEXAS INTO THE EDWARDS
PLATEAU...

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will continue across the central and southern
Plains for Saturday as gradient winds linger across KS, OK, and TX.
Early-morning water-vapor imagery depicts an upper trough digging
southward along the West Coast in the wake of a leading shortwave
trough. This wave is expected overspread the southern Plains early
Saturday with secondary cyclogenesis expected across the lower to
mid MS River Valley by late afternoon. Although the surface low will
be moving eastward away from the Plains, gradient winds behind and
ahead of a trailing cold front are expected to increase to 15-25 mph
by mid-afternoon from KS to southern TX.

...Southern TX into the Edwards Plateau...
15-25 mph westerly winds are expected across the southern half of TX
ahead of a diffuse, southward-moving cold front. Dry and
exceptionally windy conditions today (Friday) will lead to
widespread drying of fine fuels across much of central and southern
TX, which will support fire concerns for Saturday. Nearly 24 hours
of westerly downslope flow off the southern Rockies will also
promote RH reductions into the teens along the Rio Grande and across
middle and lower TX coasts. Widespread elevated conditions are
expected with a swath of critical 20-25 mph winds and 15-20% RH
likely from the San Angelo area southeastward into the south TX
Brush Country.

...Nebraska to Kansas, Oklahoma, and the TX Panhandle...
Dry conditions are expected within the post-frontal regime Saturday
afternoon as northerly winds increase to 15-20 mph. Despite an
influx of cooler temperatures, dewpoints in the single digits
coupled with limited cloud cover should promote RH reductions into
the teens to low 20s. Confidence is fairly high in the development
of elevated to critical fire weather conditions across southern NE
into KS and OK/adjacent portions of the TX Panhandle where fuels are
currently dry and supportive of fire spread. Consideration was given
to introducing a Critical risk area across western KS into northwest
OK, but rain chances over the next 24 hours may limit fuel status to
some degree. Critical risk delineations may be needed if rainfall
amounts are less than anticipated and/or if holdover fires from
lightning strikes on Friday pose a heightened fire weather concern
on Saturday given the expected dry/windy conditions.
