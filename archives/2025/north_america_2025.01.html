Microgrids for Data Centers? Not as Crazy as It Sounds!</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-07, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTQ1NzgwMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MTE4NTQwNn0.quUwjw4AsRcGh2WfeyPCzzwJIgEjyaO6RWCPYC2NwEY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
After a year of concerted hand-wringing about the growing energy needs
of data centers, a report that dropped just before the holidays proposed
a solution that had been strangely absent from the discussion.
</p>
<p>
AI companies have seemingly grasped for every imaginable source of clean
energy to quench their thirst for power, including pricey, left-field
ideas like
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/microsoft-three-mile-island-nuclear-constellation" target="_self"><u>restarting
shuttered nuclear plants</u></a>. Some are foregoing climate concerns
altogether and ordering up
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/coreweave-natural-gas" target="_self"><u>off-grid
natural gas turbines</u></a>. In a pithily named new analysis — “Fast,
scalable, clean, and cheap enough” — the report’s authors make a
compelling case for an alternative: off-grid solar microgrids.
</p>
<p>
An off-grid solar microgrid is a system with solar panels, batteries,
and small gas generators that can work together to power a data center
directly without connecting to the wider electricity system. It can have
infinite possible configurations, such as greater or smaller numbers of
solar panels, and more or less gas-generated capacity. The
<a href="https://www.offgridai.us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>report</u></a>
models the full range of possibilities to illustrate the trade-offs in
terms of emission reductions and cost.
</p>
<p>
An eclectic group of experts got together to do the research, including
staffers from the payment company Stripe, a developer called Scale
Microgrids, and Paces, which builds software to help renewable energy
developers identify viable sites for projects. They found that an
off-grid microgrid that supplied 44% of a data center’s demand from
solar panels and used a natural gas generator the rest of the time would
cost roughly $93 per megawatt-hour compared to about $86 for large,
off-grid natural gas turbines — and it would emit nearly one million
tons of CO2 less than the gas turbines. A cleaner system that produced
90% of its power from solar and batteries would cost closer to $109 per
megawatt-hour, the authors found. While that’s more expensive than gas
turbines, it’s significantly cheaper than repowering Three Mile Island,
the fabled nuclear plant that Microsoft is bringing back online for an
estimated $130 per megawatt-hour.
</p>
<p>
One challenge with solar microgrids is that they require a lot of land
for solar panels. But a geospatial analysis showed that there’s more
than enough available land in the U.S. southwest — primarily in West
Texas — to cover estimated energy demand growth from data centers
through 2030. This shouldn’t be taken as a recommendation, per se. The
paper doesn’t interrogate the need for data centers or the trade-offs of
building renewable power for AI training facilities versus to serve
manufacturing or households. The report is just an exercise in asking
whether, <em><em>if</em></em> these data centers are going to be
developed, could they at least add as few emissions as possible? Not all
hyperscalers care about climate, and those that do might still
prioritize speed and scale over their net-zero commitments. But the
authors argue that it’s possible to build these systems more quickly
than it would be to install big gas turbines, which currently have at
least three-year lead times to procure and fall under more complicated
permitting regimes.
</p>
<p>
Before the New Year, I spoke with two of the authors — Zeke Hausfather
from Stripe and Duncan Campbell from Scale Microgrids — about the
report. Stripe doesn’t build data centers and has no plans to, but
Hausfather works for a unit within the company called Stripe Climate,
which has a “remit to work on impactful things,” he told me. He and his
colleagues got interested in the climate dilemma of data centers, and
enlisted Scale Microgrids and Paces to help investigate. Our
conversation has been lightly edited for clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Why weren’t off-grid solar microgrids really being considered
before?</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Zeke Hausfather: </strong>As AI has grown dramatically, there’s
been much more demand for data centers specifically focused on training.
Those data centers have a lot more relaxed requirements. Instead of
serving millions of customer requests in real time, they’re running
these incredibly energy intensive training models. Those don’t need to
necessarily be located near where people live, and that unlocks a lot
more potential for solar, because you need about 50 times more land to
build a data center with off-grid solar and storage than you would to
build a data center that had a grid connection.
</p>
<p>
The other change is that we’re simply running out of good grid
connections. And so a lot of the conversation among data center
developers has been focused on, is there a way to do this with off-grid
natural gas? We think that it makes a lot more sense, particularly given
the relaxed constraints of where you can build these, to go with solar
and storage, gas back-up, and substantially reduce the emissions impact.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Duncan Campbell:</strong> It was funny, when Nan [Ransohoff,
head of climate at Stripe] and Zeke first reached out to me, I feel like
they convinced me that microgrids were a good idea, which was the first
time this ever happened in my life. They were like, what do you think
about off-grid solar and storage? <em><em>Oh, the energy density is way
off, you need a ton of land.</em></em> They’re like, yeah, but you know,
for training, you could put it out in the desert, it’s fine, and
hyperscalers are doing crazy things right now to access this power. We
just went through all these things, and by the end of the call, I was
like, yeah, we should do this study. I wasn’t thinking about it this way
until me, the microgrids guy, spoke to the payments company.
</p>
<p>
<strong>So it’s just kind of against conventional logic?</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Campbell: </strong>Going off-grid at all is wild for a data
center operator to consider, given the historical impulse was, let’s
have 3x more backup generators than we need. Even the off-grid gas
turbine proposals out there feel a little nuts. Then, to say solar,
1,000 acres of land, a million batteries — it’s just so unconventional,
it’s almost heretical. But when you soberly assess the performance
criteria and how the landscape has shifted, particularly access to the
grid being problematic right now, but also different requirements for AI
training and a very high willingness to pay — as we demonstrate in our
reference case with the Three Mile Island restart — it makes sense.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Hausfather: </strong>We should be clear, when we talk about
reliability, a data center with what we model, which is solar,
batteries, and 125% capacity backup gas generators, is still probably
going to achieve upwards of 99% reliability. It’s just not gonna be the
99.999% that’s traditionally been needed for serving customers with data
centers. You can relax some of the requirements around that.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Can you explain how you went about investigating what it would
mean for data centers to use off-grid solar microgrids?</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Campbell:</strong> First we just built a pretty simple power
flow model that says, if you’re in a given location, the solar panel is
going to make this much power every hour of the year. And if you have a
certain amount of demand and a certain amount of battery, the battery is
going to charge and discharge these times to make the demand and supply
match. And then when it can’t, your generators will kick on. So that
model is just for a given solar-battery-generator combo in a given
location. Then what we did is made a huge scenario suite in 50-megawatt
increments. Now you can see, for any level of renewable-ness you want,
here’s what the [levelized cost of energy] is.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Hausfather: </strong>As you approach 100%, the costs start
increasing exponentially, which isn’t a new finding, but you’re
essentially having to overbuild more and more solar and batteries in
order to deal with those few hours of the year where you have extended
periods of cloudiness. Which is why it makes a lot more sense,
financially, to have a system with some gas generator use — unless you
happen to be in a situation where you can actually only run your data
center 90% of the time. I think that’s probably a little too heretical
for anyone today, but we did include that as one of the cases.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Did you consider water use? Because when you zoom in on the
Southwest, that seems like it could be a constraint. </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Hausfather: </strong>We talked about water use a little bit, but
it wasn’t a primary consideration. One of the reasons is that how data
centers are designed has a big effect on net water use. There are a lot
of designs now that are pretty low — close to zero — water use, because
you’re cycling water through the system rather than using evaporative
cooling as the primary approach.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What do you want the takeaway from this report to be? Should all
data centers be doing this? To what extent do you think this can replace
other options out there?</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Hausfather:</strong> There is a land rush right now for building
data centers quickly. While there’s a lot of exciting investment
happening in clean, firm generation like the enhanced geothermal that
Fervo is doing, none of those are going to be available at very large
scales until after 2030. So if you’re building data centers right now
and you don’t want to cause a ton of emissions and threaten your
company’s net-zero targets or the social license for AI more broadly,
this makes a lot of sense as an option. The cost premium above building
a gas system is not that big.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Campbell:</strong> For me, it’s two things. I see one purpose of
this white paper being to reset rules of thumb. There’s this vestigial
knowledge we have that this is impossible, and no, this is totally
possible. And it seems actually pretty reasonable.
</p>
<p>
The second part that I think is really radical is the gigantic scale
implied by this solution. Every other solution being proposed is kind of
like finding a needle in a haystack — if we find this old steel mill, we
could use that interconnection to build a data center, or, you know,
maybe we can get Exxon to make carbon capture work finally. If a
hyperscaler just wanted to build 10 gigawatts of data centers, and
wanted one plan to do it, I think this is the most compelling option.
The scalability implied by this solution is a huge factor that should be
considered.

shelves fact-checking program in US, adopts X-like ‘Community Notes’
model</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Meta is ending its fact-checking program in the U.S. and replacing it
with a “Community Notes” system similar to that on Elon Musk-owned X,
the Facebook parent said on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>The Community Notes model will allow users on Meta’s social media
sites Facebook, Instagram and Threads to call out posts that are
potentially misleading and need more context, rather than placing the
responsibility on independent fact checking organizations and
experts.  </p>
<p>“Experts, like everyone else, have their own biases and perspectives.
This showed up in the choices some made about what to fact check and how
… A program intended to inform too often became a tool to censor,” Meta
said.  </p>
<p>Meta added that its efforts over the years to manage content across
its platforms have expanded “to the point where we are making too many
mistakes, frustrating our users and too often getting in the way of the
free expression we set out to enable.” </p>
<p>The company said it would begin phasing in Community Notes in the
United States over the next couple of months and would improve the model
over the course of the year. </p>
<p>It will also stop demoting fact-checked content and use a label
notifying users there is additional information related to the post,
instead of the company’s current method of displaying full-screen
warnings that users have to click through before even viewing the
post.</p>

id="biden-to-announce-creation-of-2-new-national-monuments-to-protect-tribal-lands-in-california">Biden
to announce creation of 2 new national monuments to protect tribal lands
in California</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — President Joe Biden is establishing two new national
monuments in California that will honor Native American tribes, the
White House confirmed Tuesday, as Biden seeks to conserve at least 30%
of U.S. lands and waters by 2030 through his “America the Beautiful”
initiative.</p>
<p>Proclamations set to be signed Tuesday will create the Chuckwalla
National Monument in Southern California near Joshua Tree National Park
and the Sáttítla National Monument in Northern California. The
declarations bar drilling and mining and other development on the
624,000-acre (2,400-square-kilometer) Chuckwalla site and roughly
225,000 acres (800 square kilometers) near the Oregon border in Northern
California.</p>
<p>The new monuments will protect clean water for communities, honor
areas of cultural significance to tribal nations and Indigenous peoples,
and enhance access to nature, the White House said.</p>
<p>Biden, who has two weeks left in office, is set to visit Los Angeles
and the Eastern Coachella Valley on Tuesday after meeting Monday with
the families of the victims in the New Year’s attack in New Orleans.</p>
<p>Biden announced Monday he will ban new offshore oil and gas drilling
in most U.S. coastal waters, including in California and other West
Coast states. The plan is intended to block possible efforts by the
incoming Trump administration to expand offshore drilling.</p>
<p>The flurry of activity has been in line with the Democratic
president’s “America the Beautiful” initiative launched in 2021, aimed
at honoring tribal heritage, meeting federal goals to conserve 30% of
public lands and waters by 2030 and addressing climate change.</p>
<p>The Pit River Tribe has worked to get the federal government to
designate the Sáttítla National Monument. The area is a spiritual center
for the Pit River and Modoc Tribes and encompasses mountain woodlands
and meadows that are home to rare flowers and wildlife.</p>
<p>A number of Native American tribes and environmental groups began
pushing Biden to designate the Chuckwalla National Monument, named after
the large desert lizard, in early 2023. The monument would protect
public lands south of Joshua Tree National Park, spanning the Coachella
Valley region in the west to near the Colorado River.</p>
<p>Advocates say the monument will protect a tribal cultural landscape,
ensure access to nature for local residents and preserve military
history sites.</p>
<p>“The designation of the Chuckwalla and Sáttítla National Monuments in
California marks an historic step toward protecting lands of profound
cultural, ecological and historical significance for all Americans,”
said Carrie Besnette Hauser, president and CEO of the nonprofit Trust
for Public Land.</p>
<p>The new monuments “honor the enduring stewardship of Tribal Nations
and the tireless efforts of local communities and conservation advocates
who fought to safeguard these irreplaceable landscapes for future
generations,’’ Hauser said.</p>
<p>National monuments like Chuckwalla and Sáttítla play a key role in
addressing historical injustices and ensuring a more inclusive telling
of America’s history, she said.</p>
<p>The Chuckwalla monument is intended to honor tribal sovereignty by
including local tribes as co-stewards, following in the footsteps of a
recent wave of monuments such as the Bears Ears National Monument in
Utah, which is overseen in conjunction with five tribal nations.</p>
<p>“The protection of the Chuckwalla National Monument brings the
Quechan people an overwhelming sense of peace and joy,” the Fort Yuma
Quechan Tribe said in a statement. “Tribes being reunited as stewards of
this landscape is only the beginning of much-needed healing and
restoration, and we are eager to fully rebuild our relationship to this
place.”</p>
<p>In May, the Biden administration expanded two national monuments in
California — the San Gabriel Mountains in the south and Berryessa Snow
Mountain in the north. In October, Biden designated the Chumash Heritage
National Marine Sanctuary along the coast of central California, which
will include input from the local Chumash tribes in how the area is
preserved.</p>
<p>Last year, the Yurok Tribe in Northern California also became the
first Native people to manage tribal land with the National Park Service
under a historic memorandum of understanding signed by the tribe,
Redwood National and State Parks and the nonprofit Save the Redwoods
League, which is conveying the land to the tribe.</p>

provide enough clean energy to power 180,000 homes. The project will
cover nearly 3,500 acres, but BLM has approved a construction plan that
“avoids construction within the desert wash that crosses the project,
preserves the channel floodplain, maintains wildlife habitat
connectivity, and avoids areas of environmental sensitivity.” In its
announcement, the agency said it has approved 46 renewable energy
projects on public lands since January 2021, with total capacity
exceeding 34 gigawatts – well beyond the Biden administration’s goal of
permitting 25 gigawatts worth of renewable energy by 2025 (the
administration announced it had surpassed that goal last April).

visits Japan as Nippon Steel decision weighs on relations</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON/TOKYO — U.S. President Joe Biden’s decision to block
Nippon Steel’s $14.9 billion bid for U.S. Steel cast a shadow over
Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s visit to Japan on Tuesday for
farewell meetings with Washington’s most important ally in Asia.</p>
<p>The rejection, announced on Friday, has jolted U.S. efforts to boost
ties with Asian allies just as South Korea’s political crisis
potentially complicates a revived relationship between Washington, Seoul
and Tokyo. The trilateral alliance is a key plank in the countries’
efforts to counter China’s military buildup.</p>
<p>Investment into the U.S. could also be chilled, but analysts say any
damage to the wider U.S.-Japan relationship will likely be limited given
shared security concerns about China.</p>
<p>On Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba described Biden’s
decision to block the sale of U.S. Steel to Nippon Steel as
“perplexing.”</p>
<p>Accompanied by White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan,
Blinken met Japan’s Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya in Tokyo and will
hold talks later in the day with Ishiba and other senior Japanese
officials</p>
<p>Numerous trips to Japan over the last four years “is evidence, not
just of the importance, but of the centrality the United States attaches
to our partnership. President Biden asked me to come on this last trip
to underscore that,” Blinken told Iwaya.</p>
<p>“We have, between our two countries, a partnership that started out
focusing on bilateral issues, that worked on regional issues and that
now is genuinely global,” he added.</p>
<p>Ahead of his trip, the State Department said that Blinken wanted to
build on the momentum of U.S.-Japan-South Korea trilateral
cooperation.</p>
<p>In Seoul on Monday, Blinken reaffirmed confidence in South Korea’s
handling of its political turmoil as investigators there sought an
extension of a warrant to arrest impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol.</p>
<p>Allies of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump have also reassured Seoul
and Tokyo that he will support continuing to improve ties and advance
military, economic and diplomatic cooperation to counter China and North
Korea, Reuters reported ahead of Trump’s Nov. 5 re-election.</p>
<p>Tension, limited damage from Nippon Steel decision</p>
<p>Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel filed a lawsuit on Monday charging that
Biden violated the U.S. Constitution by blocking their $14.9 billion
merger through what they termed a sham national security review. They
called for the U.S. federal court to overturn the decision.</p>
<p>Nicholas Szechenyi, a Japan expert at Washington’s Center for
Strategic and International Studies, said Biden’s decision would make
Blinken’s Tokyo visit “awkward.”</p>

next round of bitter cold and snow will hit the southern US</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Annapolis, Maryland — The next round of bitter cold was set to
envelop the southern U.S. on Tuesday, after the first significant winter
storm of the year blasted a huge swath of the country with ice, snow and
wind.</p>
<p>The immense storm system brought disruption even to areas of the
country that usually escape winter’s wrath, downing trees in some
Southern states, threatening a freeze in Florida and causing people in
Dallas to dip deep into their wardrobes for hats and gloves.</p>
<p>By early Tuesday, wind chill temperatures could dip as low as minus
10.5 C from Texas across the Gulf Coast, according to the National
Weather Service. A low-pressure system is then expected to form as soon
as Wednesday near south Texas, bringing the potential of snow to parts
of the state that include Dallas, as well as to Oklahoma, Arkansas and
Louisiana.</p>
<p>The polar vortex that dipped south over the weekend kept much of the
country east of the Rockies in its frigid grip Monday, making many roads
treacherous, forcing school closures, and causing widespread power
outages and flight cancellations.</p>
<p>Ice and snow blanketed major roads in Kansas, western Nebraska and
parts of Indiana, where the National Guard was activated to help
stranded motorists. The National Weather Service issued winter storm
warnings for Kansas and Missouri, where blizzard conditions brought wind
gusts of up to 72 kph. The warnings extended to New Jersey into early
Tuesday.</p>
<p>A Kentucky truck stop was jammed with big rigs forced off an icy and
snow-covered Interstate 75 on Monday just outside Cincinnati. A
long-haul driver from Los Angeles carrying a load of rugs to Georgia,
Michael Taylor said he saw numerous cars and trucks stuck in ditches and
was dealing with icy windshield wipers before he pulled off the
interstate.</p>
<p>“It was too dangerous. I didn’t want to kill myself or anyone else,”
he said.</p>
<p>The polar vortex of ultra-cold air usually spins around the North
Pole, but it sometimes plunges south into the U.S., Europe and Asia.
Studies show that a fast-warming Arctic is partly to blame for the
increasing frequency of the polar vortex extending its grip.</p>
<p>Temperatures plunge across the country</p>
<p>The eastern two-thirds of the U.S. dealt with bone-chilling cold and
wind chills Monday, with temperatures in some areas far below
normal.</p>
<p>A cold weather advisory will take effect early Tuesday across the
Gulf Coast. In Texas’ capital of Austin and surrounding cities, wind
chills could drop as low as minus 9.4 C.</p>
<p>The Northeast was expected to get several cold days.</p>
<p>Transportation has been tricky</p>
<p>Hundreds of car accidents were reported in Virginia, Indiana, Kansas
and Kentucky, where a state trooper was treated for non-life-threatening
injuries after his patrol car was hit.</p>
<p>Virginia State Police responded to at least 430 crashes Sunday and
Monday, including one that was fatal. Police said other weather-related
fatal accidents occurred Sunday near Charleston, West Virginia, and
Monday in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Kansas saw two deadly crashes
over the weekend.</p>
<p>More than 2,300 flights were canceled and at least 9,100 more were
delayed nationwide as of Monday night, according to tracking platform
FlightAware. Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport reported that
about 58% of arrivals and 70% of departures had been canceled.</p>
<p>A record of more than 20 centimeters of snow fell Sunday at the
Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, leading to dozens of
flight cancellations that lingered into Monday. About 10 centimeters
fell Monday across the Cincinnati area, where car and truck crashes shut
at least two major routes leading into downtown.</p>
<p>More snow and ice are expected</p>
<p>In Indiana, snow covered stretches of Interstate 64, Interstate 69
and U.S. Route 41, leading authorities to plead with people to stay
home.</p>
<p>“It’s snowing so hard, the snow plows go through and then within a
half hour the roadways are completely covered again,” State Police
Sgt. Todd Ringle said.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands are without power</p>
<p>Many were in the dark as temperatures plunged. More than 218,000
customers were without power Monday night across Kentucky, Indiana,
Virginia, West Virginia, Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina,
according to electric utility tracking website PowerOutage.us.</p>
<p>In Virginia’s capital city, a power outage caused a temporary
malfunction in the water system, officials said Monday afternoon.
Richmond officials asked those in the city of more than 200,000 people
to refrain from drinking tap water or washing dishes without boiling the
water first. The city also asked people to conserve their water, such as
by taking shorter showers.</p>
<p>City officials said they were working nonstop to bring the system
back online.</p>

id="how-carters-covert-aid-to-afghan-rebels-redefined-his-foreign-policy-record">How
Carter’s covert aid to Afghan rebels redefined his foreign policy
record</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>President Ronald Reagan is often credited with defeating the Soviet
Union, in part by helping Afghan rebels, but it was the administration
of President Jimmy Carter that laid the groundwork.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Considered a foreign policy novice by many when he entered the White
House, Carter made the early decision to provide covert aid to Afghan
insurgents months before the Soviet invasion. The move offers a window
into one of the defining issues of his presidency, showing a president
unafraid to confront the Soviets while pursuing a policy of détente.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I think people’s image of Carter as a deeply religious man, a deeply
moral man, is very much influenced by the activities he’s done after he
left office. [But] he definitely had a ruthless side to him, and he had
a side that was very willing to use force, including nuclear weapons,”
said David Gibbs, a history professor at the University of Arizona. </p>
<p>The covert aid program initiated under Carter became the backbone of
the Afghan insurgency, setting the stage for the Soviet Union’s eventual
withdrawal in 1989.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In a bold move six months before the Soviets’ December 1979 invasion,
Carter signed a secret directive known as a “presidential finding” that
authorized the CIA to provide nonlethal aid to rebels fighting
Afghanistan’s Soviet-backed communist government.</p>
<p>That finding stayed under wraps for nearly two decades, coming to
light only when several Carter administration officials, including
former CIA Director Robert Gates and national security adviser Zbigniew
Brzezinski, disclosed its existence in the 1990s, suggesting the Carter
administration aimed to lure the Soviets into a Vietnam-style
quagmire.</p>
<p>‘Afghan trap’</p>
<p>Brzezinski’s revelations were the most striking. In a 1998 interview
with a French magazine, Carter’s Polish-born, ardently anti-communist
adviser denied provoking the Soviets but claimed the administration had
“knowingly increased the probability” of a Soviet invasion. Calling the
program “an excellent idea,” he said it had the “effect of drawing the
Russians into the Afghan trap.”</p>
<p>Although Brzezinski later disputed the accuracy of the interview and
never repeated the claim, the so-called “Afghan trap” thesis gained
traction, with critics excoriating the Carter administration for
instigating the Soviet invasion and causing decades of conflict in
Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Among scholars who see the aid program as a deliberate provocation,
Gibbs said he was initially loath to read too much into the Brzezinski
interview before becoming convinced of its veracity.</p>
<p>As Gibbs described it to VOA, a military aide once told historian
Jonathan Haslam that Brzezinski, upon learning of the Soviet invasion,
“pumped his first in the air in triumph and said, ‘They’ve taken the
bait!’”</p>
<p>“The implication was that the decision to supply aid to the
mujahideen was bait,” Gibbs said. “That, to me, is a strong indication
that what he said is true, because it was said twice over a period of
time, and it’s from the horse’s mouth.”</p>
<p>The Afghan trap thesis has permeated the works of other prominent
experts, although most now dismiss it as baseless, according to
historian Conor Tobin of the University College Dublin, who has
researched it.</p>
<p>The problem with the theory, Tobin argues, is that it views the
Carter administration’s involvement in Afghanistan through a 21st
century lens, “working backwards from the events of 9/11.”</p>
<p>“They rely almost exclusively on Gates’ memoirs, the controversial
French interview and other circumstantial and limited anecdotal evidence
without exploring the subject in detail, and without using any other
sources to corroborate the statements made,” Tobin told VOA via
email.</p>
<p>A close look at recently declassified Carter-era documents tells a
different story, Tobin said.</p>
<p>“It reveals that there was no attempt to ensnare the Soviet Union in
the Afghan trap, and U.S. policies were in fact marginal in leading to
the Soviet military intervention,” he said.</p>
<p>Nonlethal aid</p>
<p>What is not up for debate, however, is that the aid program was
launched in response to rising Soviet influence in Afghanistan. A
communist coup in April 1978 toppled the government of President
Mohammad Daoud. The new regime then initiated radical reforms, sparking
public opposition and eventually a full-blown insurgency.</p>
<p>According to Tobin, the Carter administration initially took a
“wait-and-see” approach. That policy ended with the kidnapping and
murder of U.S. Ambassador Adolph Dubs the following February. Brzezinski
then ordered a new plan for Afghanistan.</p>
<p>“Should we help any insurgents?” he asked an aide to investigate,
according to Tobin. “With whom would we have to work?”</p>
<p>A popular revolt in the western Afghan city of Herat, however, “led
to a shift in attitude in Washington and the consensus began to slide
towards a more active role,” Tobin wrote in his analysis, “The Myth of
the ‘Afghan Trap’.” </p>
<p>CIA operatives sprang into action, developing a plan of action while
reaching out to U.S. allies Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Several options
were formulated, ranging from small-scale propaganda campaigns and
nonlethal support to lethal arms supplies and military training via a
third country.</p>
<p>After determining that military assistance may “provoke vigorous
Soviet countermeasures,” the administration settled on nonlethal
aid.</p>
<p>“The decision-making process demonstrated caution, rather than an
effort to induce an invasion,” Tobin wrote.</p>
<p>On July 3, 1979, Carter authorized the CIA to provide up to $695,000
in aid to the insurgents. By mid-August, $575,000 of the funds had been
allocated for cash, medical equipment and radio transmitters to
Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence, who then delivered them to the
mujahideen, according to Tobin’s account.</p>
<p>The aid program, says Tobin, was modest but significant in two key
respects. It helped establish links with the mujahideen through
Pakistani intelligence that would prove invaluable after the Soviet
invasion. It also underscored American resolve to allies Pakistan and
Saudi Arabia, reassuring them at a time when concerns about diminishing
U.S. influence in the region were mounting.</p>
<p>The aid program came against a backdrop of escalating Cold War
tensions. The Iranian Revolution of February 1979 had robbed the U.S. of
a key strategic ally in the region. Rather than seeking to provoke the
Soviets, Brzezinski worried about a “creeping intervention” in
Afghanistan, fearing ‘’Moscow would continue to expand its influence
until a de factor invasion had taken place,’’ Tobin wrote. </p>
<p>“The objectives in mid-1979 were essentially to do something,
anything, to counter the Soviet advance in Afghanistan,” Tobin said.</p>
<p>Historian Scott Kaufman of Francis Marion University and author of a
book on Carter’s foreign policy, said the late president also had to
consider his bid for re-election the following year.</p>
<p>“He was already under attack for having ‘lost’ Nicaragua to
communists and for being ‘soft’ on the Soviet Union,” Kaufman told VOA
via email. “How would it look to voters if Carter, who wanted to get
SALT II [Strategic Arms Limitations Talks] approved, made moves that
encouraged what would be seen by them as further Soviet aggression.”</p>
<p>‘Carter Doctrine’</p>
<p>Kaufman took issue with the popular perception of Carter as a foreign
policy novice. Though he lacked the foreign policy experience of a
Richard Nixon or even Gerald Ford, Carter sat on the Trilateral
Commission and had traveled overseas as governor of Georgia, Kaufman
noted.</p>
<p>“That said, his support for the mujahideen reflected a foreign policy
that since at least 1978 reflected a hardening insofar as U.S. policy
toward the Soviet Union,” he said.</p>
<p>Carter’s tougher stance, Kaufman said, was driven by growing
anti-Soviet sentiment in Congress, Brzezinski’s influence, and his
personal disdain for Soviet repression and machinations.</p>
<p>“This does not mean that he had given up on seeking detente with the
Soviets, as reflected by his desire to get SALT II ratified,” he said.
“But his foreign policy vis-a-vis the U.S.S.R. [Soviet Union]
demonstrated a preparedness to take a harder line.”</p>
<p>Nothing demonstrated Carter’s resolve more forcefully than the
“Carter Doctrine,” his bold Persian Gulf policy adopted in response to
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Unveiling the new policy during his 1980 State of the Union address,
Carter warned that the U.S. was prepared to use “any means necessary” to
prevent a Soviet takeover of the Persian Gulf region.</p>
<p>With the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the Carter administration
upped the ante. On December 28, 1979, the day after Soviet commandos
assassinated Afghan President Hafizullah Amin in Kabul, Carter signed a
new finding that authorized the supply of weapons and training for the
mujahideen. The first batch of weapons arrived in Pakistan in less than
two weeks.</p>
<p>Carter went on to lose the 1980 election to Reagan, whose
administration largely continued Carter’s Afghan policy for several
years before dramatically building up the covert aid program to the tune
of several hundred million dollars a year. Instead of merely harassing
the Soviets, the Reagan administration sought its defeat, according to
Tobin.</p>
<p>“The criticism of the Carter administration as weak on defense,
therefore, is unjustified, with Carter largely laying the groundwork for
the renewed global containment of the 1980s,” Tobin said.</p>
<p>“So, despite enduring orthodox assessments of Carter as a foreign
policy failure, he departed office in January 1981 leaving a clear
foreign policy direction for the incoming Reagan administration that
arguably contributed to the end of the Cold War a decade later — an
outcome that was almost incomprehensible as the Carter administration
took office in January 1977.”</p>

playing both sides of the conflict to advance its political
objectives.</p>
<p>The war erupted in April 2023 amid a power struggle between the
Sudanese Armed Forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF)
ahead of a planned transition to civilian rule, triggering the world’s
largest displacement and hunger crisis.</p>
<p>In November Russia vetoed a U.N. Security Council draft resolution
that called on the warring parties to immediately cease hostilities and
ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid. The remaining 14 council
members voted in favor of the text.</p>
<p>“Russia chose obstruction: standing alone as it voted to imperil
civilians, while funding both sides of the conflict – yes, that’s what I
said: both sides,” the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Linda
Thomas-Greenfield, told the council on Monday, without giving further
details.</p>
<p>When asked to elaborate, a spokesperson for the U.S. mission to the
U.N. said Washington was aware of Russia’s “ongoing interest in Sudan’s
gold trade” and condemns any material support for the warring parties –
“whether it be through illicit gold trading or the provision of military
equipment.”</p>
<p>“We believe Sudanese authorities’ gold mining cooperation with
sanctioned Russian entities and individuals could prove inimical to
Sudan’s long-term interests and the aspirations of the Sudanese people
for an end to the war,” the U.S. mission to the U.N. spokesperson
said.</p>
<p>In response, Russia’s deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy said:
“We regret that the U.S. tries to judge other world powers by its own
yardstick.”</p>
<p>“It’s obvious that in the Pax Americana which our American colleagues
try to preserve at any price, relations with other countries are built
only on their exploitation and criminal schemes aimed at U.S.
enrichment,” he said.</p>
<p>Reuters was unable to immediately contact Sudan’s warring parties for
comment.</p>
<p>In December, Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia rejected what
he called “fabrications spread by Western countries and their media”
that Moscow was trying to play both sides to gain an advantage from the
war.</p>
<p>At what she said would likely be her last council meeting,
Thomas-Greenfield became visibly emotional while addressing her
counterparts on Sudan, a crisis that has been a focus for her during her
four years at the world body.</p>
<p>“For all the disappointment that I couldn’t do more, that we – all of
us – didn’t do more – I still remain hopeful,” she said. “Hopeful that
the representatives sitting around this table – the colleagues who have
become friends – will continue this sacred mission, this ultimate
responsibility.”</p>
<p>Thomas-Greenfield was appointed by President Joe Biden. Donald Trump
will succeed Biden on Jan. 20.</p>

id="us-adds-tencent-catl-to-list-of-chinese-firms-allegedly-aiding-beijings-military">US
adds Tencent, CATL to list of Chinese firms allegedly aiding Beijing’s
military</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON/NEW YORK — The U.S. Defense Department said on Monday it
has added Chinese tech giants including gaming and social media leader
Tencent Holdings and battery maker CATL to a list of firms it says work
with China’s military.</p>
<p>The list also included chip maker Changxin Memory Technologies,
Quectel Wireless and drone maker Autel Robotics, according to a document
published on Monday.</p>
<p>The annually updated list of Chinese military companies, formally
mandated under U.S. law as the “Section 1260H list,” designated 134
companies, according to a notice posted to the Federal Register.</p>
<p>U.S.-traded shares of Tencent, which is also the parent of Chinese
instant messaging app WeChat, fell 8% in over-the-counter trading.
Tencent said in a statement that its inclusion on the list was “clearly
a mistake.” It added: “We are not a military company or supplier. Unlike
sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our
business.”</p>
<p>CATL called the designation a mistake, saying it “is not engaged in
any military related activities.”</p>
<p>A Quectel spokesperson said the company “does not work with the
military in any country and will ask the Pentagon to reconsider its
designation, which clearly has been made in error.”</p>
<p>The other companies and the Chinese embassy in Washington did not
respond to requests or did not immediately comment.</p>
<p>Amid strained relations between the world’s two biggest economies,
the updated list is one of numerous actions taken by Washington in
recent years to highlight and restrict Chinese companies it says pose
security risks.</p>
<p>Craig Singleton, a China expert at the Foundation for Defense of
Democracies, said the additions showed that it was “reckless” for
American firms to conduct business with a growing swath of Chinese
corporations.</p>
<p>“The U.S. isn’t just safeguarding a handful of technologies anymore,”
he said. “The garden of sensitive technologies is growing, and the fence
protecting them is being fortified. Today’s list lays bare that these
aren’t just commercial companies. They’re critical enablers of China’s
military modernization, directly fueling Beijing’s strategic
ambitions.”</p>
<p>Other companies added include MGI Tech, which makes genomic
sequencing instruments, and Origincell Technology, which lawmakers have
alleged operates a cell bank network and bio-storage technologies.
Neither firm immediately responded to requests for comments.</p>
<p>U.S. lawmakers had pushed the Pentagon throughout 2024 to add some of
the companies, including CATL, to the list. Ford Motor is building a
battery plant in Michigan and plans to license CATL technology to
produce low-cost lithium-iron batteries at the facility – a move that
has sparked concerns by some lawmakers. Ford did not immediately comment
on Monday.</p>
<p>While the designation does not involve immediate bans, it can be a
blow to the reputations of affected companies and represents a stark
warning to U.S. entities and firms about the risks of conducting
business with them. It could also add pressure on the Treasury
Department to sanction the companies.</p>
<p>Two previously listed companies, drone maker DJI and Lidar-maker
Hesai Technologies, both sued the Pentagon last year over their previous
designations but remain on the updated list.</p>
<p>The Pentagon also removed six companies it said no longer met the
requirements for the designation, including AI firm Beijing Megvii
Technology, China Railway Construction Corporation Limited, China State
Construction Group Co. and China Telecommunications Corporation.</p>

talk and tables walk at AI-dominated Consumer Electronics Show</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LAS VEGAS — Home appliances that do chores, cars that know your
favorite cafe, and robot pets aiming to please are among artificial
intelligence-infused offerings at the Consumer Electronics Show opening
Tuesday.</p>
<p>All these will compete for attention at the annual CES extravaganza
in Las Vegas, as vendors behind the scenes seek ways to deal with
tariffs threatened by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.</p>
<p>AI is once again a major theme of the show, along with autonomous
vehicles ranging from tractors and boats to lawn mowers and golf club
trollies.</p>
<p>South Korean consumer electronics giant LG kicked off a media day
Monday by outlining a vision for “Affectionate Intelligence” in which
home appliances watch over people — from tracking how well they sleep to
making sure they remember umbrellas when rain is in the forecast.</p>
<p>“At LG, we’re seamlessly integrating AI into physical living spaces
around us,” said CEO William Cho.</p>
<p>“We see space not merely as a physical location but as an environment
where holistic experiences come to life — across the Home, Mobility,
Commercial and even Virtual spaces.”</p>
<p>Before the show floor even opened, vendors enticed visitors with
electric roller skates, hologram booths for life-size remote
collaboration, and even a robot that looked like a lamp affixed to the
top of a walking table.</p>
<p>Most offerings boasted being enhanced with AI.</p>
<p>“Everybody is going to be talking about AI … whether it is there or
not,” Creative Strategies analyst Carolina Milanesi told AFP.</p>
<p>AI on the move</p>
<p>CES will also be a gigantic auto show, with carmakers and those
supplying software and parts showing off self-driving and automated
safety capabilities.</p>
<p>“CES has been an auto show for a while now, and if anything, it is
more so this year,” said Techsponential analyst Avi Greengart.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s close relationship with Trump is expected to
reduce regulatory speed bumps regarding autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>And while still far from being a part of everyday life, flying cars
will be part of the CES scene, according to independent tech analyst Rob
Enderle.</p>
<p>“You should start seeing flying vehicles you can buy,” Enderle said.
“Getting approval to fly them is a whole other matter.”</p>
<p>Robots designed to handle work tasks or be comforting companions —
and even adorable pets — are among CES’ exhibits.</p>
<p>Gadgets for calming the mind, beautifying the body, or helping get a
sound night’s sleep are on display as tech continues to seep into every
aspect of existence.</p>
<p>“Digital health is going to be huge,” said Greengart.</p>
<p>“We are seeing a lot more tech being worn or used to track your
health markers.”</p>
<p>AI-enhanced tech will also be infusing homes, from a spice dispenser
that “learns” a cook’s taste and robot swimming pool cleaners.</p>
<p>Tariff anxiety?</p>
<p>Tariffs talked about by Trump would raise costs for imported items,
and that will likely be on the minds of CES attendees targeting the U.S.
market, according to analysts.</p>
<p>A lot of the products at the show have imported components, and if
Trump hits Canada, China and Mexico with tariffs, it will mean a spike
in prices, analyst Enderle said.</p>
<p>“There will be a lot of concerned vendors at CES,” Enderle said of
the tariff trepidation.</p>
<p>Talk at CES will include how to navigate supply chain constraints
that could be caused by tariffs, according to Greengart.</p>
<p>“But a lot of the talk will happen behind closed doors to not anger
the coming administration,” he added.</p>
<p>Chinese companies with significant U.S. presence, like smart
television rivals TCL and Hisense, are at CES.</p>
<p>But Greengart warns of a “growing bifurcation of market between China
and the rest of the world” as trade frictions play out.</p>

dramatically shrinks Guantanamo prisoner population to 15 men</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration slashed the
prisoner population at Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba by nearly
half on Monday, sending 11 detainees to Oman.</p>
<p>The U.S. military said only 15 detainees remained there after the
transfer, following a major push toward closing the facility by Biden’s
administration in its final days in office.</p>
<p>The detention center was first opened on Jan. 11, 2002, by President
George W. Bush to hold terrorism suspects and “illegal enemy combatants”
during the U.S. “War on Terror” following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on
New York and Washington.</p>
<p>Guantanamo Bay housed roughly 680 prisoners at the detention center’s
peak in 2003, according to Pentagon data.</p>
<p>The latest transfer of the 11 men, all of whom are from Yemen, leaves
the U.S. naval base in Cuba with fewer detainees than when it opened
with the arrival of prisoners from Afghanistan.</p>
<p>“The United States appreciates the willingness of the government of
Oman and other partners to support ongoing U.S. efforts focused on
responsibly reducing the detainee population and ultimately closing the
Guantanamo Bay facility,” the U.S. military said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Pentagon named the 11 men transferred as: Uthman Abd al-Rahim
Muhammad Uthman, Moath Hamza Ahmed al-Alwi, Khalid Ahmed Qassim, Suhayl
Abdul Anam al Sharabi, Hani Saleh Rashid Abdullah, Tawfiq Nasir Awad
Al-Bihani, Omar Mohammed Ali al-Rammah, Sanad Ali Yislam Al Kazimi,
Hassan Muhammad Ali Bib Attash, Sharqawi Abdu Ali Al Hajj and Abd
Al-Salam Al-Hilah.</p>
<p>Of the remaining 15 detainees, the Pentagon said three are eligible
for transfer and an equal number are eligible for a periodic review
board to examine their cases. The remainder have been charged or
convicted of war crimes.</p>
<p>The facility has long been criticized by human rights groups and
legal advocates over potential breaches of international human rights
laws and conditions at the camp.</p>

id="minneapolis-to-revamp-police-training-force-policies-after-george-floyds-murder">Minneapolis
to revamp police training, force policies after George Floyd’s
murder</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MINNEAPOLIS — The Minneapolis City Council on Monday approved an
agreement with the federal government to overhaul the city’s police
training and use-of-force policies in the wake of the murder of George
Floyd. </p>
<p>The deal incorporates and builds on changes the Minneapolis Police
Department has made since Floyd, a Black man, was killed by a white
officer in 2020, prompting a national reckoning with police brutality
and racism. </p>
<p>The 171-page agreement, filed in federal court shortly after the
council’s 12-0 vote, says the department will require its officers to
“promote the sanctity of human life as the highest priority in their
activities.” It says officers must “carry out their law enforcement
duties with professionalism and respect for the dignity of every
person.” And it says they must not allow race, gender or ethnicity “to
influence any decision to use force, including the amount or type of
force used.” </p>
<p>The agreement, known as a consent decree, means the department will
be under long-term court supervision. It had been under negotiation
since the Department of Justice issued a scathing critique of the city’s
police in June 2023. </p>
<p>The report alleged that police systematically discriminated against
racial minorities, violated constitutional rights and disregarded the
safety of people in custody for years before Floyd’s killing. </p>
<p>The Justice Department report was the result of a sweeping two-year
investigation that confirmed many citizen complaints about police
conduct. The investigation found that Minneapolis officers used
excessive force, including “unjustified deadly force,” and violated the
rights of people engaged in constitutionally protected speech. </p>
<p>An independent monitor will oversee the changes, and a judge must
approve them. </p>
<p>During his first administration, President-elect Donald Trump was
critical of consent decrees as anti-police. Finalizing the Minneapolis
agreement before he returns to office Jan. 20 would make it harder for
him to undercut the deal, because changes would require court
approval. </p>
<p>The council approved the deal 12-0 Monday during a brief public vote
that followed an hours-long, closed-door discussion. </p>
<p>“I’d like to thank our community for standing together, united in
this, and for having patience with us as we have traveled a very, very
long and challenging journey,” Council President Elliott Payne said
after the vote. “We’re just beginning, and we know we have a long way to
go. Our success will only be realized when we all work together on what
is arguably one of the most important issues in the life of our
city.” </p>
<p>Council Member Robin Wonsley said in a statement before the vote that
she has “no faith that the Trump administration will be a serious
partner” in implementing the agreement. </p>
<p>“Having a federal consent decree signed and in place is valuable to
police reform efforts, but we need to be sober about the fact that it
will take local political will to hold the city and the (Mayor Jacob)
Frey administration accountable to implementing and enforcing the terms
of the consent decree,” she said. </p>
<p>A state court judge in 2023 approved a similar agreement between
Minneapolis and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights after the state
agency issued its own blistering report in 2022. The state investigation
found that the city’s police had engaged in a pattern of race
discrimination for at least a decade. </p>
<p>The Justice Department has opened 12 similar investigations of state
and local law enforcement agencies since April 2021, many in response to
high-profile deaths at the hands of police. </p>
<p>It has reached agreements with Seattle, New Orleans, Baltimore,
Chicago and Ferguson, Missouri. A consent decree with Louisville,
Kentucky, after an investigation prompted by the fatal police shooting
of Breonna Taylor is awaiting court approval. In Memphis, Tennessee, the
mayor last month pushed back against pressure for a consent decree
there, saying his city has made hundreds of positive changes since the
beating death of Tyre Nichols. </p>
<p>Consent decrees require law enforcement to meet specific goals before
federal oversight is removed, a process that often takes years and
millions of dollars. A major reason Minneapolis hired Brian O’Hara as
police chief in 2022 was his experience implementing a consent decree in
Newark, New Jersey. </p>
<p>If the Minneapolis federal agreement gets court approval, the city
would be in the unusual position of operating under both federal and
state consent decrees.</p>

id="two-indian-companies-indicted-in-us-for-importing-ingredients-used-in-opioid-fentanyl">Two
Indian companies indicted in US for importing ingredients used in opioid
fentanyl</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Two Indian chemical companies have been indicted for
allegedly importing ingredients for the highly addictive opioid fentanyl
into the United States and Mexico, the U.S. Department of Justice said
Monday. </p>
<p>Athos Chemicals and Raxuter Chemicals, both based in Gujarat, were
each charged in Brooklyn with distributing the ingredients and
conspiring to distribute them. </p>
<p>Raxuter and senior executive Bhavesh Lathiya, 36, were also charged
with smuggling, and introducing misbranded drugs into interstate
commerce. </p>
<p>Lathiya was arrested on Saturday in New York and ordered detained
pending trial, after prosecutors called him a flight risk and a
substantial danger to the community. </p>
<p>“The Justice Department is targeting every link in fentanyl
trafficking supply chains that span countries and continents and too
often end in tragedy in the United States,” U.S. Attorney General
Merrick Garland said in a statement.</p>
<p>A federal public defender representing Lathiya declined to comment.
Athos and Raxuter did not immediately respond to similar requests
outside business hours. </p>
<p>Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid about 50 times more powerful than
heroin and 100 times more powerful than morphine. </p>
<p>Opioids accounted for about 82,000 U.S. deaths in 2022, 10 times the
number in 1999, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. </p>
<p>Prosecutors said that since February 2024, the defendants supplied
“precursor” chemicals they knew would be used to make fentanyl, and hid
their efforts by mislabeling packages, falsifying customs forms, and
making false declarations at border crossings. </p>
<p>One indictment said that in October 2024 video calls with an
undercover agent posing as a fentanyl manufacturer, Lathiya agreed to
sell 20 kilograms of the precursor chemical 1-boc-4-piperidone, and
suggested mislabeling them as an antacid. </p>
<p>Lathiya did this after the agent told him his Mexico clients were
“very happy with the quality of what you sent me,” and with the “yield”
from the resulting fentanyl, the indictment said. </p>
<p>The other indictment said Athos agreed last February to sell 100
kilograms of the same chemical to a known drug trafficker in Mexico who
was making fentanyl in connection with a drug trafficking
organization. </p>
<p>Lathiya faces up to 53 years in prison if convicted, the Justice
Department said.</p>

<p>U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman in Manhattan said Giuliani had not
complied with requests from the election workers, Ruby Freeman and her
daughter Wandrea Moss, for information that could help them determine
which of his assets may be turned over to pay off the defamation
judgment.</p>
<p>“The fact that he is a busy person who in the past relied on others
is not an excuse for noncompliance,” Liman said.</p>
<p>The contempt citation in the district where Giuliani had been the top
federal prosecutor marks a further fall from grace for Giuliani, once
known as “America’s Mayor” for his response to the September 11, 2001,
attacks.</p>
<p>The ruling stems from a lawsuit Freeman and Moss brought against
Giuliani in 2021. They accused the former personal lawyer to Republican
President-elect Donald Trump of destroying their reputations by lying
that they tried to help steal the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Giuliani made repeated false claims that a surveillance video showed
the pair concealing and counting suitcases filled with illegal ballots
at a basketball arena in Atlanta that was used to process votes.</p>
<p>Giuliani has been disbarred for making false claims about the 2020
election, and pleaded not guilty to criminal charges in Georgia and
Arizona that he aided Trump’s failed attempt to overturn his loss.</p>
<p>In July 2023, Giuliani conceded he made defamatory statements about
Freeman and Moss, and a judge that August ruled he was liable for
defamation as a sanction against him for failing to turn over electronic
records to the two election workers.</p>
<p>A Washington, D.C., jury later ordered he pay Freeman and Moss
roughly $73 million in compensation and $75 million as punishment.</p>
<p>Liman said on Monday he had not yet determined the punishment
Giuliani would face for contempt.</p>
<p>But the judge also ruled that Giuliani had not responded to questions
from Moss and Freeman about a Palm Beach, Florida, condominium he
owns.</p>
<p>Liman said he would presume Giuliani’s lack of response suggested the
answers would be unfavorable to him at an upcoming Jan. 16 trial over
whether he treated the condominium as his permanent residence. Freeman
and Moss contend Giuliani did not live there full time, meaning it could
be turned over.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Freeman and Moss have also urged Liman to hold Giuliani
in contempt for ignoring his orders to give up his Manhattan apartment,
the title to a 1980 Mercedes and sports memorabilia. That request is
still pending.</p>
<p>Giuliani, 80, has claimed that his day-to-day life has been upended
by the two election workers, making it difficult to obtain necessary
paperwork, and that he has not “willfully disobeyed” any court
orders.</p>
<p>Giuliani’s lawyer, Joseph Cammarata, said on Monday that the time
frame for Giuliani to respond to the election workers’ demands was tight
but that he sought to comply.</p>
<p>“There’s been substantial compliance,” Cammarata said. “There is no
defiance to the court.”</p>

reports 1st bird flu-related death in US, state agency says</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Louisiana Department of Health said Monday that a
U.S. patient hospitalized with H5N1 bird flu had died, the country’s
first death from an outbreak of the virus that has sickened dozens of
people and millions of poultry and cattle. </p>
<p>Nearly 70 people in the U.S. have contracted bird flu since April,
according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most
of them livestock workers exposed to sick chickens or dairy cattle. </p>
<p>The patient in Louisiana, the first person in the country to be
hospitalized with the virus, contracted bird flu after exposure to a
combination of backyard chickens and wild birds, said Louisiana health
officials. The patient was hospitalized on Dec. 18, state health
officials said. </p>
<p>The patient was over 65 and had underlying medical conditions, the
officials said. </p>
<p>“While the current public health risk for the general public remains
low, people who work with birds, poultry or cows, or have recreational
exposure to them, are at higher risk,” the department said in a
statement.  </p>
<p>The CDC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

eases restrictions on Syria while keeping sanctions in place</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. on Monday eased some restrictions on Syria’s
transitional government to allow the entry of humanitarian aid after
Islamist insurgents ousted Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad last month.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury Department issued a general license lasting six
months that authorizes certain transactions with the Syrian government,
including some energy sales and incidental transactions.</p>
<p>The move does not lift sanctions on the nation that has been battered
by more than a decade of war but indicates a limited show of U.S.
support for the new transitional government.</p>
<p>The general license underscores America’s commitment to ensuring its
sanctions “do not impede activities to meet basic human needs, including
the provision of public services or humanitarian assistance,” a Treasury
Department statement said.</p>
<p>Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo said his agency “will
continue to support humanitarian assistance and responsible governance
in Syria.”</p>
<p>Since Assad’s ouster, representatives from the nation’s new de facto
authorities have said the new Syria will be inclusive and open to the
world.</p>
<p>The U.S. has gradually lifted some penalties since Assad departed
Syria for protection in Russia. The Biden administration in December
decided to drop a $10 million bounty it had offered for the capture of a
Syrian rebel leader whose forces led the ouster of Assad last month.</p>
<p>The announcement followed a meeting in Damascus between the leader of
Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS; Ahmad al-Sharaa, who was once aligned with
al-Qaida; and the top U.S. diplomat for the Middle East, Barbara Leaf,
who led the first U.S. diplomatic delegation into Syria since Assad’s
ouster. The U.S. and U.N. have long designated HTS as a terrorist
organization.</p>
<p>HTS led a lightning insurgency that ousted Assad on Dec. 8 and ended
his family’s decades-long rule. From 2011 until Assad’s downfall,
Syria’s uprising and civil war killed an estimated 500,000 people.</p>
<p>Much of the world ended diplomatic relations with Assad because of
his crackdown on protesters and sanctioned him and his Russian and
Iranian associates.</p>
<p>Most of the Western-led sanctions targeted Assad and his associates
for the brutal crackdown on protesters and their manufacturing of the
amphetamine-like stimulant Captagon, which reportedly generated billions
of dollars as packages of the little white pills were smuggled across
Syria’s porous borders.</p>
<p>With Assad out of the picture, Syria’s new authorities hope the
international community will pour money into the country to rebuild its
battered infrastructure and make its economy viable again.</p>
<p>Syria’s infrastructure has been battered, with power cuts rampant in
the country and some 90% of its population living in poverty. About half
the population won’t know where its next meal will come from as
inflation surges.</p>
<p>The pressure to lift sanctions has mounted in recent years as aid
agencies continue to cut programs due to donor fatigue and a massive
2023 earthquake that rocked Syria and Turkey. The tremor killed over
59,000 people and destroyed critical infrastructure that couldn’t be
fixed due to sanctions and overcompliance, despite the U.S. announcing
some humanitarian exemptions.</p>
<p>Qutaiba Idlbi, a research fellow at the Atlantic Council who leads
work on Syria, said ahead of the general license issuance:</p>
<p>“There is a general agreement,” among regional and international
governments, “that we need to avoid driving Syria back into chaos.”</p>
<p>“The only path forward is to engage positively,” he said.</p>

cyber watchdog: No signs Treasury breach hit other federal agencies</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. cyber watchdog agency CISA said Monday there
was “no indication” the recently reported breach at the U.S. Treasury
Department had affected any other federal agency. </p>
<p>Late last month the U.S. Treasury reported that an unspecified number
of computers had been compromised by Chinese hackers following a breach
at contractor BeyondTrust, which provides cybersecurity services.  </p>
<p>BeyondTrust said last month that a limited number of clients were
affected but has not elaborated. </p>
<p>“As the forensic investigation is ongoing, BeyondTrust is unable to
confirm the other customers who may or may not have been impacted,” the
company said Monday in an email. </p>
<p>The Washington Post has reported that the hackers breached the U.S.
Treasury office that administers economic sanctions, aiming to steal
information about Chinese entities that the U.S. government might be
considering designating for financial sanctions. </p>
<p>Republican lawmakers have demanded a briefing about the breach, which
is the latest in a series of intrusions blamed on Beijing. </p>
<p>Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, has
previously described the Treasury hack reports as “irrational” and
represented “smear attacks” against China.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
It’s a bad sign when they won’t tell you the exact numbers.
</p>
<p>
On Thursday, Tesla released final production
<a href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-fourth-quarter-2024-production-deliveries-and-deployments" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>figures</u></a>
for 2024, which saw the EV maker post a rare year-over-year decline in
sales growth. It’s likely that a slow start for the Cybertruck, Tesla’s
only new model in recent memory, was a big cause of the slowdown. But we
can’t tell you <em><em>exactly</em></em> how well or poorly the big
truck is doing because the company won’t tell us.
</p>
<p>
Tesla delivered
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/tesla-sales-2024" target="_self"><u>1,789,226
total vehicles</u></a> to customers last year. The popular, reasonably
affordable Model 3 or Model Y EVs made up more than 95% of those sales.
The remainder were lumped into a group called “other models,” meaning
Cybertruck and the long-in-the-tooth, expensive Model X and Model S, a
move that has the same flavor as a Friday afternoon news dump. The
“other models” accounted for just 85,133 deliveries, or 4.8% of Tesla’s
total.
</p>
<p>
If you’ve been following Heatmap’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-sales-q3-2024" target="_self"><u>coverage</u></a>
then this comes as no surprise. Elon Musk &amp; Co. sold just shy of
17,000 Cybertrucks during the third quarter of last year (July to
September). That made the shiny metal beast the third-best-selling EV in
America after Tesla’s two volume sellers. But Cybertruck was a distant
third behind those two EVs. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Tesla
delivered 23,640 “other models,” meaning that’s the maximum number of
Cybertrucks it could have sold.
</p>
<p>
The writing for Tesla’s sales slump has been on the wall for years. A
recent design refresh helped bump Model 3 sales, and the company is
still working on a rumored update to the Model Y, the world’s
best-selling EV, that might give Tesla a shot in the arm. But with
Tesla’s future prospects
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/cheap-tesla" target="_self"><u>resting
with the Cybercab</u></a> and other autonomous aspirations, the
Cybertruck is the brand’s only current opportunity to boost its bottom
line with a new vehicle.
</p>
<p>
Except that the stainless steel war rig was never a good candidate for
high-volume sales. Cybertruck starts at $80,000. It has suffered
embarrassing viral moments where the vehicle failed at basic truck tasks
such as getting out of snow or sand. It comes with some cool amenities,
such as the ability to
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/10/hurricane-helene-electric-vehicle-power-outage/680106/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>back
up one’s home power supply</u></a> via bidirectional charging. It also
serves as the avatar of everything Elon, making the car a polarizing
hard pass for anyone who
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/anti-elon-bumper-sticker-tesla" target="_self"><u>doesn’t
want to be publicly profiled</u></a> as a Musk fan.

Cybertruck endured a slow start dogged by production delays and nagging,
frequent recalls. Soon it became evident that demand for the vehicle
wasn’t exactly red-hot. Musk at one point has claimed that a million
people put their names down for a Cybertruck, but doing so cost only
$100, so the length of that list doesn’t mean much. More telling was the
report that Tesla was scrubbing the badging off the limited-edition
Foundation series, which wasn’t selling, so it could offer the vehicles
as ordinary Cybertrucks.
</p>
<p>
As
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/3/24334954/tesla-cybertruck-sales-demand-expectation-elon-musk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>The
Verge</em></em></u></a> notes, how you’d grade the Cybertruck depends
entirely on what you believe its potential to be. As a competitor to EV
pickup trucks like the Rivian R1T, Ford F-150 Lightning, and Chevy
Silverado EV, the Tesla is the king — Cybertruck is outselling all those
models. But electric truck sales have been sluggish all along, making
the Cybertruck the big fish in a pretty small pond.
</p>
<p>
If the Cybertruck’s raison d’etre was simply to bring Musk’s Mad Max
daydream to life, then it has succeeded. But if the goal of the
Cybertruck was to sell lots of cars, then it’s hard to argue it has been
anything but a boondoggle.
</p>
<p>
The automakers nipping at Tesla’s heels in the EV market, including
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1hsr449/gm_us_2024_ev_sales_114432_up_50/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>GM</u></a>
and
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/746147/kia-ev-sales-record-2024-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Hyundai/Kia</u></a>,
have every reason to see a path to more growth, even with the lingering
uncertainty of an
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-kill-ev-tax-credit" target="_self"><u>unfriendly
new era</u></a> of American government. They’re rolling out new models
and posting record sales. If they can continue to bring down the
starting price of their electric models, lots of their customers could
be ready to ditch fossil fuel engines.
</p>
<p>
But, at least for today, Tesla’s status it tethered to the Cybertruck,
which doesn’t have a lot of room to grow. Once upon a time, Tesla teased
a high-end version of the vehicle that would have
<a href="https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/you-ordered-the-500-miles-cybertruck-and-they-launch-with-the-350-miles-what-do-you-do.8946/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>500
miles of range</u></a>, as well as an entry-level Cybertruck that could
start in the neighborhood of $50,000. Realizing either of those goals
could make many drivers — at least those not immediately turned off at
the thought of owning this thing — take a long look at the Cybertruck.
Neither appears imminent.
</p>
<p>
Musk’s reaction to all this might be a shrug. Rather than rounding out
his stable of cars with an affordable EV with the potential to sell in
huge numbers, he has bet the farm on Tesla winning the autonomous
vehicle race and tossed out the Cybertruck as a treat to his hardcore
devotees. Now he must hope enough of them buy it to keep Tesla’s
cratering stock price afloat while he chases the future.

id="us-adds-tencent-catl-to-list-of-chinese-firms-allegedly-aiding-beijings-military-1">US
adds Tencent, CATL to list of Chinese firms allegedly aiding Beijing’s
military</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington/New York — The U.S. Defense Department said on Monday it
has added Chinese tech giants including gaming and social media leader
Tencent Holdings and battery maker CATL to a list of firms it says work
with China’s military.  </p>
<p>The list also included chip maker Changxin Memory Technologies,
Quectel Wireless and drone maker Autel Robotics, according to a document
published on Monday.</p>
<p>The annually updated list of Chinese military companies, formally
mandated under U.S. law as the “Section 1260H list,” designated 134
companies, according to a notice posted to the Federal Register.</p>
<p>U.S.-traded shares of Tencent, which is also the parent of Chinese
instant messaging app WeChat, fell 8% in over-the-counter trading.
Tencent said in a statement that its inclusion on the list was “clearly
a mistake.” It added: “We are not a military company or supplier. Unlike
sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our
business.”</p>
<p>CATL called the designation a mistake, saying it “is not engaged in
any military related activities.”</p>
<p>A Quectel spokesperson said the company “does not work with the
military in any country and will ask the Pentagon to reconsider its
designation, which clearly has been made in error.”</p>
<p>The other companies and the Chinese embassy in Washington did not
respond to requests or did not immediately comment.</p>
<p>Amid strained relations between the world’s two biggest economies,
the updated list is one of numerous actions taken by Washington in
recent years to highlight and restrict Chinese companies it says pose
security risks.</p>
<p>Craig Singleton, a China expert at the Foundation for Defense of
Democracies, said the additions showed that it was “reckless” for
American firms to conduct business with a growing swath of Chinese
corporations.</p>
<p>“The U.S. isn’t just safeguarding a handful of technologies anymore,”
he said. “The garden of sensitive technologies is growing, and the fence
protecting them is being fortified. Today’s list lays bare that these
aren’t just commercial companies. They’re critical enablers of China’s
military modernization, directly fueling Beijing’s strategic
ambitions.”</p>
<p>Other companies added include MGI Tech, which makes genomic
sequencing instruments, and Origincell Technology, which lawmakers have
alleged operates a cell bank network and bio-storage technologies.

for a Somewhat Sustainable Aviation Fuel</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
There’s no quick fix for decarbonizing medium- and long-distance
flights. Batteries are typically too heavy, and hydrogen fuel takes up
too much space to offer a practical solution, leaving sustainable
aviation fuels made from plants and other biomass, recycled carbon, or
captured carbon as the primary options. Traditionally, this fuel is much
more expensive — and the feedstocks for it much more scarce — than
conventional petroleum-based jet fuel. But companies are now racing to
overcome these barriers, as recent months have seen backers throw
hundreds of millions behind a series of emergent, but promising
solutions.
</p>
<p>
Today, most SAF is made of feedstocks such as used cooking oil and
animal fats, from companies such as
<a href="https://www.airport-technology.com/news/air-canada-sustainable-aviation-fuel-neste/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Neste</u></a>
and
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/lpo-announces-conditional-commitment-montana-renewables-significantly-expand-us" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Montana
Renewables</u></a>. But this supply is limited by, well, the amount of
cooking oil or fats restaurants and food processing facilities generate,
and is thus projected to meet only about 10% of total SAF demand by
2050, according to a
<a href="https://3stepsolutions.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/assets/custom/010856/downloads/Making-Net-Zero-Aviation-possible.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2022
report</u></a> by the Mission Possible Partnership. Beyond that,
companies would have to start growing new crops just to make into fuel.
</p>
<p>
That creates an opportunity for developers of second-generation SAF
technologies, which involve making jet fuel out of captured carbon or
alternate biomass sources, such as forest waste. These methods are not
yet mature enough to make a significant dent in 2030 targets, such as
the EU’s mandate to use 6% SAF and the U.S. government’s goal of
producing
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/bioenergy/sustainable-aviation-fuel-grand-challenge" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>3
billion gallons of SAF</u></a> per year domestically. But this tech will
<em><em>need</em></em> to be a big part of the equation in order to meet
the aviation sector’s overall goal of net zero emissions by 2050, as
well as the EU’s sustainable fuels mandate, which increases to 20% by
2035 and 70% by 2050 for all flights originating in the bloc.
</p>
<p>
“That’s going to be a massive jump because currently, SAF uptake is
about 0.2% of fuel,” Nicole Cerulli, a research associate for
transportation and logistics at the market research firm Cleantech
Group, told me. The head of the
<a href="https://www.iata.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>airline
industry’s trade association</u></a>, Willie Walsh,
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/global-airlines-could-miss-sustainable-fuel-targets-iatas-walsh-says-2024-12-10/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said
in December</u></a> at a media day event, “We’re not making as much
progress as we’d hoped for, and we’re certainly not making as much
progress as we need.” While global SAF production doubled to 1 million
metric tons in 2024, that fell far below the trade group’s projection of
1.5 million metric tons,
<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodity-insights/en/news-research/latest-news/crude-oil/120623-saf-production-to-triple-to-15-mil-mt-in-2024-but-progress-slow-iata" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>made
at the end of 2023</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Producing SAF requires making hydrocarbons that mirror those used in
traditional jet fuel. We know how to do that, but the processes required
— electrolysis, gasification, and the series of chemical reactions known
as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis — are energy intensive. So finding a way to
power all of this sustainably while simultaneously scaling to meet
demand is a challenging and expensive task.
</p>
<p>
Aamir Shams, a senior associate at the energy think tank RMI whose work
focuses on driving demand for SAF, told me that while sustainable fuel
is undeniably more expensive than traditional fuel, airlines and
corporations have so far been willing to pay the premium. “We feel that
the lag is happening because we just don’t have the fuel today,” Shams
said. “Whatever fuel shows up, it just flies off the shelves.”
</p>
<p>
Twelve, a Washington-based SAF producer, thinks its e-fuels can help
make a dent. The company is looking to produce jet fuel initially by
recycling the CO2 emitted from the ethanol, pulp, and paper industries.
In September,
<a href="https://www.twelve.co/post/twelve-announces-645-million-in-funding-led-by-tpg-to-transform-co2-in-jet-fuel-and-e-chemicals-a-s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
company raised $645 million</u></a> to complete the buildout of its
inaugural SAF facility in Washington state, support the development of
future plants, and pursue further R&amp;D. The funding includes $400
million in project equity from the impact fund TPG Rise Climate, $200
million in Series C financing led by TPG, Capricorn Investment Group,
and Pulse Fund, and $45 million in loans. The company has also
previously
<a href="https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2819999/the-air-force-partners-with-twelve-proves-its-possible-to-make-jet-fuel-out-of/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>partnered
with the Air Force</u></a> to explore producing fuel on demand in hard
to reach areas.
</p>
<p>
Nicholas Flanders, Twelve’s CEO, told me that the company is starting
with ethanol, pulp, and paper because the CO2 emissions from these
facilities are relatively concentrated and thus cheaper to capture. And
unlike, say, coal power plants, these industries aren’t going anywhere
fast, making them a steady source of carbon. To turn the captured CO2
into sustainable fuel, the company needs just one more input — water.
Renewable-powered electrolyzers then break apart the CO2 and H2O into
their constituent parts, and the resulting carbon monoxide and hydrogen
are combined to create a syngas. That then gets put through a chemical
reaction known as “Fischer-Tropsch synthesis,” where the syngas reacts
with catalysts to form hydrocarbons, which are then processed into
sustainable jet fuel and ultimately blended with conventional fuel.
</p>
<p>
Twelve says its proprietary CO2 electrolyzer can break apart CO2 at much
lower temperatures than would typically be required for this molecule,
which simplifies the whole process, making it easier to ramp the
electrolyzers up and down to match the output of intermittent
renewables. (How does it do this? The company didn’t respond when I
asked.) Twelve’s first plant, which sources carbon from a nearby ethanol
facility, is set to come online next year, producing 50,000 gallons of
SAF annually once it’s fully scaled, with electrolyzers that will run on
hydropower.
</p>
<p>
While Europe may have stricter, actually enforceable SAF requirements
than the U.S., Flanders told me there’s a lot of promise in domestic
production. “I think the U.S. has an exciting combination of relatively
low-cost green electricity, lots of biogenic CO2 sources, a lot of
demand for the product we’re making, and then the inflation Reduction
Act and state level incentives can further enhance the economics.”
Currently, the IRA provides SAF producers with a baseline $1.25 tax
credit per gallon produced, which gradually increases the greener the
fuel gets. Of course, whether or not the next Congress will rescind this
is anybody’s guess.
</p>
<p>
Down the line, incentives and mandates will end up mattering a whole
lot. Making SAF simply costs a whole lot more than producing jet fuel
the standard way, by refining crude oil. But in the meantime, Twelve is
setting up cost-sharing partnerships between airlines that want to
reduce their direct emissions (scope 1) and large corporations that want
to reduce their indirect emissions (scope 3), which include employee
business travel.
</p>
<p>
For example, Twelve has offtake agreements with Seattle-based Alaska
Airlines and Microsoft for the fuel produced at its initial Washington
plant. Microsoft, which aims to reduce emissions from its employees’
flights, will essentially cover the cost premium associated with
Twelve’s more expensive SAF fuel, making it cost-effective for Alaska to
use in its fleet. Twelve has a similar agreement with Boston Consulting
Group and an unnamed airline
</p>
<p>
Eventually, Flanders told me, the company expects to source carbon via
direct air capture, but doing so today would be prohibitively expensive.
“If there were a customer who wanted to pay the additional amount to use
DAC today, we’d be very happy to do that,” Flanders said. “But our
perspective is it will maybe be another decade before that cost starts
to converge.”
</p>
<p>
No sustainable fuel is even close to cost parity yet — Cerulli told me
that it generally comes with a “roughly 250% to over 800%” cost premium
over conventional jet fuel. So while voluntary uptake by companies such
as Microsoft and BCG are helping drive the emergent market today, that
won’t be near enough to decarbonize the industry. “At the simplest
level, the cost of not using SAF has to be higher than using it,”
Cerulli told me.
</p>
<p>
Pathway Energy thinks that by incorporating carbon sequestration into
its process, it can help the world get there. The sustainable fuels
company, which
<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/carbon-negative-fuels-pioneer-pathway-energy-debuts-with-ultra-negative-sustainable-aviation-fuel-and-plans-for-new-saf-facility-on-us-gulf-coast-302329556.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>emerged
from stealth</u></a> just last month, is pursuing what CEO Steve Roberts
told me is “probably the most cost-efficient long-term pathway from a
decarbonization perspective.” The company is building a $2 billion SAF
plant in Port Arthur, Texas designed to produce about 30 million gallons
of jet fuel annually — enough to power about 5,000 carbon-neutral
10-hour flights — while also permanently sequestering more than 1.9
million tons of CO2.
</p>
<p>
Pathway, a subsidiary of the investment and advisory firm Nexus
Holdings, has partnered with the UK-based renewable energy company Drax,
which will supply the company with 1 million metric tons of wood
pellets, to be turned into fuel using a series of well-established
technologies. The first step is to gasify the biomass by heating the
pellets to high temperatures in the absence of oxygen to produce a
syngas. Then, just as Twelve does, it puts the syngas through the
Fischer-Tropsch process to form the hydrocarbons that become SAF.
</p>
<p>
The competitive advantage here is capturing the emissions from the fuel
production process itself and storing them permanently underground.
Since Pathway is burying CO2 that’s already been captured by the trees
from which the wood pellets come, that would make Pathway’s SAF
carbon-negative, in theory, while the best Twelve and similar companies
can hope for is carbon neutrality, assuming all of their captured carbon
is used to produce fuel.
</p>
<p>
The choice of Drax as a feedstock partner is not without controversy,
however, as the BBC revealed that the company sources much of its wood
from
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-68381160" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rare
old-growth forests</u></a>. Though this is technically legal, it’s also
ecologically disruptive. Roberts told me Drax’s sourcing methodologies
have been verified by third parties, and Pathway isn’t concerned. “I
don’t think any of that controversy has yielded any actually significant
changes to their sourcing program at all, because we believe that
they’re compliant,” Roberts told me. “We are 100% certain that they’re
meeting all the standards and expectations.”
</p>
<p>
Pathway has big growth plans, which depend on the legitimacy of its
sustainability cred. Beyond the Port Arthur facility, which Roberts told
me will begin production by the end of 2029 or early 2030, the company
has a pipeline of additional facilities along the Gulf Coast in the
works. It also has global ambitions. “When you have a fuel that is this
negative, it really opens up a global market, because you can transport
fuel out of Texas, whether that be into the EU, Africa, Asia, wherever
it may be,” Roberts said, explaining that even substantial
transportation-related emissions would be offset by the
carbon-negativity of the fuel.
</p>
<p>
But alternative feedstocks such as forestry biomass are finite
resources, too. That’s why many experts think that within the SAF
sector, e-fuels such as Twelve’s that could one day source carbon via
direct air capture and then electrolyze it have the greatest potential
for growth. “It’s extremely dependent on getting sustainable CO2 and
cheap electricity prices so that you can make cheap green hydrogen,”
Shams told me. “But theoretically, it is unlimited in terms of what your
total cap on production would be.”
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, airlines are focused on making their planes and engines
more aerodynamic and efficient so that they don’t consume as much fuel
in the first place. They’re also exploring other technical pathways to
decarbonization — because after all, SAF will only be a portion of the
solution, as many short and medium-length flights could likely be
powered by batteries or hydrogen fuel.
<a href="https://saf.rmi.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>RMI
forecasts</u></a> that by 2050, 45% of global emissions reduction in the
aviation sector will come from improvements in fuel efficiency, 37% will
be due to SAF deployment, 7% will come from hydrogen, and 3.5% will come
from electrification.
</p>
<p>
If you did the mental math, you’ll notice these numbers add up to 92.5%
— not 100%. “What we have done is, let’s look at what we are actually
doing today and for the past three, four, five years, and let’s see if
we get to net zero or not. And the answer is, no. We don’t get to net
zero by 2050,” Shams told me. And while getting to 92.5% is nothing to
scoff at, that means that the aviation sector would still be emitting
about 700 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent by that time.
</p>
<p>
So what’s to be done? “The financing sector needs to step up its game
and take a little bit more of a risk than they are used to,” Shams told
me, noting that one of RMI’s partners, the
<a href="https://www.missionpossiblepartnership.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Mission
Possible Partnership</u></a>, estimates that getting the aviation sector
to net zero will require an investment of around $170 billion per year,
a total of about $4.5 trillion by 2050. These numbers take a variety of
factors into account beyond strictly SAF production, such as airport
infrastructure for new fuels, building out direct air capture plants,
etc.
</p>
<p>
But any way you cut it, it’s a boatload of money that certainly puts
Pathway’s $2 billion SAF facility and Twelve’s $645 million funding
round in perspective. And it’s far from certain that we can get there.
“Increasingly, that goal of the 2050 net-zero target looks really
difficult to achieve,” Shams put it simply. “Commitments are always
going up, but more can be done.”

Americans love their public lands — particularly
<a href="https://www.coloradocollege.edu/other/stateoftherockies/_documents/2024-poll-data/2024%20Topic%20Report%20on%20Conservation%20and%20Public%20Lands%20in%20the%20West.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Americans
living in the West</u></a>, where easy access to the region’s
undeveloped forests, mountains, rivers, deserts, and lakes is a point of
identity and pride. But on Friday, in its first action as a voting body,
the House of Representatives for the 119th Congress approved
<a href="https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20241230/119PACKAGE3_xml.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
rules package</u></a> that
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/01/03/house-gop-rules-change-would-make-it-easier-to-sell-off-federal-land/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reintroduces
a provision</u></a> making it easier for lawmakers to cede control of
federal lands to local authorities. That, in turn, could result in vast
swaths of the West being
<a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/culture/opinion/utah-lawsuit-public-land/#:~:text=those%20protections%20would%20vanish" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>opened
up to drilling</u></a> or auctioned off to private owners,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/utah-seven-county-blm" target="_self"><u>according
to critics</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
“It’s an obscure provision that [Congress] is using to essentially
obfuscate the paving of the way towards selling off federal public
lands,” Michael Carroll, the BLM Campaign Director at the Wilderness
Society, told me of the rulemaking maneuver.
</p>
<p>
Republicans have tried this before. In 2017, during the party’s
trifecta, the House approved a rules package with a near-identical
provision that essentially declared that public lands do not have a
budgetary value that needs to be accounted for when they’re sold,
streamlining potential handovers. New Mexico Democratic Representative
Raúl Grijalva
<a href="https://democrats-naturalresources.house.gov/media/press-releases/grijalva-pushes-back-on-gop-proposal-to-make-it-even-easier-to-give-away-americas-public-lands" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>described
the provision at the time</u></a> as allowing Congress to “give away
every single piece of property we own, for free, and pretend we have
lost nothing of any value.”
</p>
<p>
Utah Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz subsequently attempted to
take advantage of the provision by introducing legislation that would
have transferred 3 million acres of Western federal land to state
control — a bill that was met by so much opposition from hunters,
anglers, and
<a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2017/02/12/utahns-drown-out-chaffetz-with-demand-to-explain-yourself-at-tense-town-hall/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>his
own furious constituents</u></a> that he ultimately

it</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
The provision briefly disappeared from the rules packages of the 116th
and 117th Congresses, when the House was controlled by Democrats, then
<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-resolution/5/text" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reappeared
again</u></a> in 2023, when Congress was split but the House was in
Republican control. But to advocates for public lands, the provision’s
inclusion in the 119th Congress’ rules seems like a mere extension and
more like a tactical teeing-up for the incoming Republican trifecta.
“Utah politicians aren’t stupid. They learn from their mistakes,”
Carroll said.
</p>
<p>
He described an anticipated three-pronged approach to land privatization
headed into 2024: the judiciary route, with the Supreme Court poised to
decide whether or not to hear a Utah lawsuit over
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/utah-seven-county-blm#:~:text=Utah%20v.%20the%20United%20States" target="_self"><u>the
constitutionality of federal control of BLM lands</u></a> later
thisweek; the legislative route, which began with Friday’s rule package;
and the administrative route, with Trump’s nominee for Secretary of the
Interior
<a href="https://heatmap.news/tag/doug-burgum" target="_self"><u>Doug
Burgum</u></a>, who
<a href="https://coloradosun.com/2024/12/16/trump-public-lands-opinion-zornio/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>supports
Utah’s lawsuit</u></a>, under a directive to increase drilling. “It’s
all backed up by the amount of money that the state of Utah appropriated
to support their lawsuit — $20 million that they didn’t have that last
time,” Carroll added.
</p>
<p>
He doesn’t expect Republicans to sit around twiddling their thumbs,
either. In 2017, the “Trump administration was pretty new to governing
and the levers of power.” He expects in 2024 “we’re going to see, in the
next two weeks, legislation that moves to privatize public lands.”
</p>
<p>
“We need to hear Republicans when they say, ‘Drill, baby drill,’”
Carroll went on. “That has real consequences for federal public lands.”

to visit New Orleans, relatives of victims of terrorist attack</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden will
visit New Orleans on Monday to grieve with relatives of the 14 people
who were killed and 35 injured there when a man drove a rented pickup
truck at high speed through a group of pedestrians in the early hours of
New Year’s Day.</p>
<p>The Bidens plan to meet with family members of the victims who were
run over when the suspect, identified by authorities as Shamsud-Din
Jabbar, a 42-year-old military veteran from Houston, sped down bustling
Bourbon Street, a prime tourist, restaurant and bar locale. Police
fatally shot Jabbar after he opened fire on officers.</p>
<p>“I’ve been there,” Biden told reporters Sunday ahead of his visit,
reflecting on the loss of his own family members through his years in
public life. “There’s nothing you can really say to somebody that’s just
had such a tragic loss. My message is going to be personal if I get to
get them alone.”</p>
<p>Watch related report by Arash Arabasadi:</p>
<p>Biden, with two weeks remaining in office before President-elect
Donald Trump is inaugurated, is also meeting with investigators who say
that Jabbar acted alone in the attack but was inspired by the Islamic
State to carry out the terror attack.</p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation said that Jabbar posted five
videos on social media expressing support for the Islamic State
terrorist group, or IS, over roughly an hour and a half before the
attack as New Orleans revelers celebrated the first hours of 2025. An IS
flag was found in the back of the truck.</p>
<p>An official with the country’s top criminal investigative agency said
Sunday that Jabbar, wearing specialized hands-free glasses, last October
twice visited the French Quarter neighborhood where the attack
occurred.</p>
<p>Lyonel Myrthil, FBI special agent in charge of the New Orleans Field
Office, Myrthil said video shows the suspect riding through the French

<p>Myrthil also said officials are also investigating two foreign trips
Jabbar took, one to Cairo in the summer of 2023 and then to Canada a few
days later.</p>
<p>“Our agents are getting answers to where he went, who he went with
and how those trips may or may not tie into his actions here,” Myrthil
said.</p>
<p>FBI Deputy Assistant Director Christopher Raia told reporters at a
news conference Saturday, “All investigative details and evidence that
we have now still support that Jabbar acted alone here in New Orleans.
We have not seen any indications of an accomplice in the United States,
but we are still looking into potential associates in the U.S. and
outside of our borders.”</p>
<p>Biden said investigators told him the suspect had a remote detonator
in his truck that was meant to set off two explosive devices placed
inside ice coolers along Bourbon Street. But police killed Jabbar before
he could detonate the explosives.</p>
<p>Representative Mike Turner, chairman of the House of Representatives
Intelligence Committee, on Sunday reiterated to CBS’s “Face the Nation”
show a previously disclosed U.S. claim, that there are Islamic State
members and other terrorist organizations that are inside the United
States “working in conjunction with ISIS with the intention of harming
Americans.”</p>
<p>“We don’t know where they are,” Turner said.</p>
<p>Outgoing Homeland Security chief Alejandro Mayorkas told ABC’s “This
Week” show that there has been a “significant increase” over the last 10
years in “homegrown violent extremism.”</p>
<p>“It is a very difficult threat landscape,” Mayorkas said. He pledged
a smooth transition to Trump’s appointment as the incoming Homeland
Security secretary, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem.</p>
<p>“I have spoken with Governor Noem a number of times, including on New
Year’s Day and immediately thereafter, with respect to the horrific
terrorist attack,” Mayorkas said.</p>
<p>“We have spoken substantively about the measures that we take, and I
am incredibly devoted to a smooth and successful transition to the
success of Governor Noem, should she be confirmed as the secretary of
Homeland Security,” Mayorkas said.</p>
<p>Biden’s Monday visit to New Orleans is occurring with heightened
security concerns in Washington as Congress meets to certify that Trump
defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in the November election.</p>
<p>It is four years to the day after Trump supporters rampaged through
the U.S. Capitol, ransacking congressional offices and attacking law
enforcement officers to block certification of Biden’s victory over
Trump in the 2020 election. Trump has vowed, within hours of taking
office on January 20, to pardon many of those arrested and imprisoned in
the January 6, 2021, attack.</p>

US Steel file suit after Biden administration blocks $15 billion
deal</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Japan’s Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel are filing a federal
lawsuit challenging the Biden administration’s decision to block a
proposed nearly $15 billion deal for Nippon to acquire Pittsburgh-based
U.S. Steel.</p>
<p>The suit, filed Monday in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia, alleges that it was a political decision and violated the
companies’ due process.</p>
<p>Nippon Steel had promised to invest $2.7 billion in U.S. Steel’s
aging blast furnace operations in Gary, Indiana, and Pennsylvania’s Mon
Valley. It also vowed not to reduce production capacity in the United
States over the next decade without first getting U.S. government
approval.</p>
<p>Biden on Friday decided to stop the Nippon takeover — after federal
regulators deadlocked on whether to approve it — because “a strong
domestically owned and operated steel industry represents an essential
national security priority. … Without domestic steel production and
domestic steel workers, our nation is less strong and less secure,” he
said in a statement.</p>
<p>While administration officials have said the move is unrelated to
Japan’s relationship with the U.S. — this is the first time a U.S.
president has blocked a merger between a U.S. and Japanese firm.</p>
<p>Biden departs the White House in just a few weeks.</p>
<p>The president’s decision to block the deal comes after the Committee
on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, failed to
reach consensus on the possible national security risks of the deal last
month, and sent a long-awaited report on the merger to Biden. He had 15
days to reach a final decision.</p>

in 11th hour action, bans new offshore oil and gas drilling in most
federal waters</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President Joe Biden is moving to ban new offshore oil
and gas drilling in most U.S. coastal waters, a last-minute effort to
block possible action by the incoming Trump administration to expand
offshore drilling.</p>
<p>Biden, whose term expires in two weeks, said he is using authority
under the federal Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to protect offshore
areas along the East and West coasts, the eastern Gulf of Mexico and
portions of Alaska’s Northern Bering Sea from future oil and natural gas
leasing.</p>
<p>“My decision reflects what coastal communities, businesses and
beachgoers have known for a long time: that drilling off these coasts
could cause irreversible damage to places we hold dear and is
unnecessary to meet our nation’s energy needs,” Biden said in a
statement.</p>
<p>“As the climate crisis continues to threaten communities across the
country and we are transitioning to a clean energy economy, now is the
time to protect these coasts for our children and grandchildren,” he
said.</p>
<p>Biden’s orders would not affect large swaths of the Gulf of Mexico,
where most U.S. offshore drilling occurs, but it would protect
coastlines along California, Florida and other states from future
drilling.</p>
<p>Biden’s actions, which protect more than 625 million acres of federal
waters, could be difficult for President-elect Donald Trump to unwind,
since they would likely require an act of Congress to repeal. Trump
himself has a complicated history on offshore drilling. He signed a
memorandum in 2020 directing the Interior secretary to prohibit drilling
in the waters off both Florida coasts, and off the coasts of Georgia and
South Carolina until 2032.</p>
<p>The action came after Trump initially moved to vastly expand offshore
drilling, before retreating amid widespread opposition in Florida and
other coastal states.</p>
<p>Trump has vowed to establish what he calls American “energy
dominance” around the world as he seeks to boost U.S. oil and gas
drilling and move away from Biden’s focus on climate change.</p>
<p>Environmental advocates hailed Biden’s action, saying new oil and gas
drilling must be sharply curtailed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
that contribute to global warming. 2024 was the hottest year in recorded
history.</p>
<p>“This is an epic ocean victory!” said Joseph Gordon, campaign
director for the environmental group Oceana.</p>
<p>Gordon thanked Biden “for listening to the voices from coastal
communities” that oppose drilling and “contributing to the bipartisan
tradition of protecting our coasts.”</p>
<p>Biden’s actions build on the legacy of Democratic and Republican
presidents to protect coastal water from offshore drilling, Gordon said,
adding that U.S. coastlines are home to tens of millions of Americans
and support billions of dollars of economic activity that depend on a
clean environment, abundant wildlife and thriving fisheries.</p>
<p>In balancing multiple uses of America’s oceans, Biden said it was
clear that the areas he is withdrawing from fossil fuel use show
“relatively minimal potential” that does not justify possible
environmental, public health and economic risks that would come from new
leasing and drilling.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Trump mocked Biden, saying, “Joe Biden clearly
wants high gas prices to be his legacy.”</p>
<p>The spokeswoman, Karoline Leavitt, called Biden’s action “a
disgraceful decision designed to exact political revenge on the American
people who gave President Trump a mandate to increase drilling and lower
gas prices. Rest assured, Joe Biden will fail, and we will drill, baby,
drill.”</p>
<p>Biden has proposed up to three oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of
Mexico, but none in Alaska, as he tries to navigate between energy
companies seeking greater oil and gas production and environmental
activists who want him to shut down new offshore drilling in the fight
against climate change.</p>
<p>A five-year drilling plan approved in 2023 includes proposed offshore
sales in 2025, 2027 and 2029. The three lease sales are the minimum
number the Democratic administration could legally offer if it wants to
continue expanding offshore wind development.</p>
<p>Under the terms of a 2022 climate law, the government must offer at
least 60 million acres (24.2 million hectares) of offshore oil and gas
leases in any one-year period before it can offer offshore wind
leases.</p>
<p>Biden, whose decision to approve the huge Willow oil project in
Alaska drew strong condemnation from environmental groups, has
previously limited offshore drilling in other areas of Alaska and the
Arctic Ocean.</p>

determined that the environmental and economic risks and harms that

eastern Gulf of Mexico, the Pacific off the coasts of Washington,
Oregon, and California, as well as parts of the Northern Bering Sea in
Alaska. As <em><em>Politico</em></em>

most of those areas are of little interest to the oil and gas industry,
but “the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico is believed to hold large
untapped reservoirs of oil.” It will be difficult for the incoming Trump
administration to dismantle Biden’s ban, but the fossil fuel industry is
likely to challenge it. With this decision, Biden will have conserved
more lands and waters than any other U.S. president, the White House
added. “President Biden has been a steadfast champion for climate
progress from Day One of his administration,” Margie Alt, director of
the Climate Action Campaign, said in a statement. “His legacy of
conservation and advocacy to protect our climate will leave an indelible

blast of snow, ice and bitter cold grips US from Midwest to East
Coast</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A major winter blast of snow, ice, wind and plunging temperatures in
the U.S. stirred dangerous travel conditions from central and southern
states all the way to the East Coast early Monday, prompting schools and
government offices in several states to close.</p>
<p>Snow and ice blanketed major roads across Kansas, western Nebraska
and parts of Indiana, where the state’s National Guard was activated to
help stranded motorists. At least 20 centimeters of snow was expected,
along with gusting winds up to 72 kph.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings from Kansas
and Missouri all the way to New Jersey.</p>
<p>“For locations in this region that receive the highest snow totals,
it may be the heaviest snowfall in at least a decade,” the weather
service said.</p>
<p>Gary Wright wore a parka as he and his husband chipped away at thick
ice coating his SUV in a slippery apartment parking lot in Missouri.
Wright said he will work remotely Monday, but wanted to scrape off his
vehicle as an excuse to spend a little time in the snow. He also is
seeking boots for their two older dogs that “won’t budge at all” when
their paws hit the cold ground.</p>
<p>The polar vortex of ultra-cold air usually spins around the North
Pole. People in the U.S., Europe and Asia experience its intense cold
when the vortex escapes and plunges southward.</p>
<p>Studies show a fast-warming Arctic is partly to blame for the
increasing frequency of the polar vortex extending its icy grip.</p>
<p>Classes canceled</p>
<p>School closings are expected to be widespread Monday. Districts in
Indiana, Virginia and Kentucky began announcing cancellations and delays
on Sunday afternoon. Kentucky’s Jefferson County Public Schools canceled
classes, extracurricular activities and athletics for its nearly 100,000
students.</p>
<p>Classes also have been cancelled in Maryland, where Gov. Wes Moore
declared a state of emergency Sunday and announced the state government
would be closed Monday.</p>
<p>“Keeping Marylanders safe is our top priority. Please stay off the
roads during this storm. Prepare your home and family and charge your
communications devices in case you lose power,” Moore said in a
statement.</p>

<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NTQ1NjI2Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5MDQxODEyN30.JLIDH2jGYv1z0KrJExRDpglkBvjpQvaRnAwV9BmuEZo/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
When Donald Trump won the 2024 U.S. presidential election, the risk to
recent progress on climate policy was immediately obvious: He ran on a
promise to increase fossil fuel production, has a long history of
denigrating renewable energy, and is hostile to anything with Joe
Biden’s name on it, including a raft of policies enacted over the past
four years to reduce emissions.
</p>
<p>
But as unique a character as Trump is, his victory was just one part of
an international surge in right-wing populism that has occurred over the
past few years, especially in Europe. Right-wing populists focus their
appeals on a supposed conflict between ordinary people and what they
claim is a corrupt elite; the philosophy is also usually characterized
by nativism and a suspicion of international cooperation and
integration. All of that comfortably translates into antagonism toward
climate action. So if right-wing populists are on the march globally,
what are the risks for global climate policy?
</p>
<p>
The picture is complex — not every populist party puts environmental
issues near the center of its agenda. The Alternative for Germany party
(also known as AfD) recently gained a high-profile supporter when Elon
Musk
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/germany-election-musk-far-right-afd-welt-915cc6821cd48c3168a7895b1d1c1a35" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wrote
an op-ed</u></a> calling it “the last spark of hope” for Germany, citing
“cultural integrity” as one of the reasons he supports it. But it was
already gaining, even if most Germans find it repellent: In September,
it
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/02/europe/afd-germany-election-thuringia-saxony-intl/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>became</u></a>
the first far-right party to win a state election since World War II.
</p>
<p>
The AfD’s platform (which it has helpfully
<a href="https://www.afd.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2017-04-12_afd-grundsatzprogramm-englisch_web.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>translated
into English</u></a>) is as full-on denialist as you can find from any
major political party; it rejects the idea of anthropogenic climate
change and demands an end to German efforts to reduce emissions. “We
want to end the perception of CO2 as an exclusively harmful substance
and set a stop to Germany’s maverick policy in the reduction of CO2
emissions,” it says.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile in the Netherlands, Geert Wilders’ PVV is now the
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1r0xvn0z5o" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>largest
party</u></a> in the governing coalition (though after six months of
negotiations following the PVV’s showing in the last election, Wilders
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2qvqwq0gxlo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>agreed</u></a>
to let another coalition partner become prime minister). Its platform
<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/why-the-dutch-election-result-spells-trouble-for-europes-climate-efforts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>promised</u></a>
that the Dutch “Climate Act, the [Paris] climate accord and all other
climate measures go straight into the shredder.” Austria’s far-right FPO
party
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/austria-election-results-far-right-fpo-wins-rcna173160" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>placed
first</u></a> in elections in September; it opposes most efforts to
combat climate change. (Austria’s Chancellor Karl Nehammer, from the
center-right OVP or “People’s Party,”
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/austrian-coalition-talks-collapse-chancellor-step-down-2025-01-04/" target="_blank">resigned
Saturday</a> after coalition talks with FPO broke down.)
</p>
<p>
In last summer’s parliamentary elections in France, the far-right
National Rally pledged a rollback of environmental laws,
<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/far-right-france-risks-paralyzing-eu-green-deal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>including</u></a>
“slashing the value-added tax on gas, power and fuel from 20 percent to
5.5 percent; freezing all new wind projects; and easing energy
efficiency requirements for homeowners looking to sell their
properties,” according to <em><em>Politico</em></em>. The party
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/france-election-runoff-results-07-07-24-intl/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>failed</u></a>
to win a plurality in the second round of voting, but it displayed a
strength that
<a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/environment/article/2024/06/15/french-environmentalists-alarmed-by-the-potential-rise-of-far-right-to-power_6674876_114.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>alarmed</u></a>
many environmentalists. And after last year’s European Parliament
elections, far-right parties
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/european-parliament-election-far-right-b9339cf1a7d2067bf6fa1941c166936d#" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>now
control</u></a> a quarter of the seats in the body, more than ever
before.
</p>
<p>
For these parties, the single most important issue is immigration; their
appeal is driven by backlash to influxes of newcomers from Syria and
northern African countries, which has contributed to a changing
demographic picture. But while environmental policies may be secondary,
the issues are hardly unrelated. Versions of “Great Replacement” theory
are visible everywhere, the idea that liberal elites are importing
non-white immigrants to displace native-born whites and transform the
nation. In this telling, green policy is one more way the conspiracy of
cultural elites tries to control the lives of the nation’s truest
citizens.
</p>
<p>
Far-right parties often get their strongest support in rural areas,
<a href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/2024/02/28/how-to-end-republican-exploitation-of-rural-america/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>just
as Republicans do</u></a> in the U.S., where farmers
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/french-farmers-protests-paris-tractors-67c34b632b6a868e2c1b6cebe02b3cbd" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>protest</u></a>
environmental policies imposed from urban capitals and which they see as
the brainchildren of cosmopolitan elites who are either indifferent or
actively hostile to their needs. Last spring, farmers
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/03/europe/europe-farmers-protests-explainer-intl/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>staged</u></a>
dramatic protests in France, Germany, Belgium, and other countries,
protesting environmental policies they said made it difficult for them
to earn a living.
</p>
<p>
In that way, opposition to climate action
<a href="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article?id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000443" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>fits</u></a>
neatly within the rest of the right-wing populist philosophy and agenda,
which usually reject international accords like the Paris Agreement and
even the existence of the European Union itself. Repealing climate laws
can be a way of striking back at experts and cosmopolitan urbanites,
whether it’s Trump rolling back EV subsidies or European rightists
attacking the EU’s
<a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Green
Deal</u></a>, which among other things
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/28/europe/eu-climate-change-law-net-zero-intl/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>obligates</u></a>
the continent to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.
</p>
<p>
The far-right populist parties aren’t the only ones pushing back certain
kinds of climate action; center-right parties are also playing a part,
even if historically they have been far more progressive on climate than
the GOP. Consider the European Union’s law requiring that no
internal-combustion cars be produced after 2035, which
<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/how-the-eu-ditched-the-combustion-engine-zero-emissions-green-deal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>passed</u></a>
in 2022. That law is now under attack from the center-right, especially
the European People’s Party, the largest bloc in the European
Parliament. The EPP (which includes EU president Ursula von der Leyen
among its members) is
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eus-largest-political-group-pushes-weaken-combustion-engine-ban-2024-12-10/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>seeking</u></a>
to have the ban repealed, or at least modified to allow for continued
production of plug-in hybrids and ICE cars that run on biofuels.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, far-right parties that want to maximize their power to the
point where they can lead governing coalitions have an incentive to
moderate their rhetoric on climate. One can see that dynamic in Italian
prime minister Georgia Meloni, whose rhetoric on the international stage
sounds much more progressive than her party does
<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/bgiorgia-meloni-italy-heat-summer-wildfires-climate-change-climate-denial/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>at
home</u></a>, where it still traffics in climate denial. She has even
<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/italy-giorgia-meloni-climate-change-right-wing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>presented</u></a>
climate as a right-wing issue, saying “The right loves the environment
because it loves the land, the identity, the homeland.”
<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-right-wing-show-donald-trump-climate-maga-style-cop29-azerbaijan-giorgia-meloni-viktor-orban-nuclear-power/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>This
version</u></a> of environmentalism seeks to combat climate change in
order to minimize the numbers of future climate migrants from the Global
South, many of whom will wind up seeking refuge in Europe.
</p>
<p>
However you feel about that motivation, it points to a vicious cycle
that could emerge in the future: As global temperatures increase and
natural disasters become more frequent, more places become uninhabitable
and millions of people become climate refugees. They head north into
developed countries, where their presence spurs a right-wing backlash
that puts far-right populist parties into power. Those parties then
reverse progressive climate policies, making it more difficult to reduce
emissions and continuing the cycle.
</p>
<p>
That might not be our future, and the changes to climate policy
advocated by the resurgent populist parties haven’t yet been
implemented. It’s also possible that the far right’s political moment
could be fleeting. But the next few years will offer plenty of reasons
to worry.

id="jimmy-carter-raised-climate-change-concerns-35-years-before-the-paris-accords">Jimmy
Carter raised climate change concerns 35 years before the Paris
Accords</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PLAINS, GEORGIA — When Jimmy Carter chose branding designs for his
presidential campaign, he passed on the usual red, white and blue. He
wanted green.</p>
<p>Emphasizing how much the Georgia Democrat enjoyed nature and
prioritized environmental policy, the color became ubiquitous. On
buttons, bumper stickers, brochures, the sign rechristening the old
Plains train depot as his campaign headquarters. Even the hometown
Election Night party.</p>
<p>“The minute it was announced, we all had the shirts to put on — and
they were green, too,” said LeAnne Smith, Carter’s niece, recalling the
1976 victory celebration.</p>
<p>Nearly a half-century later, environmental advocates are remembering
Carter, who died on Dec. 29 at the age of 100, as a president who
elevated environmental stewardship, energy conservation and discussions
about the global threat of rising carbon dioxide levels.</p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to abandon the renewable
energy investments that President Joe Biden included in the Inflation
Reduction Act of 2022, echoing how President Ronald Reagan dismantled
the solar panels Carter installed on the White House roof. But politics
aside, the scientific consensus has settled where Carter stood two
generations earlier.</p>
<p>“President Carter was four decades ahead of his time,” said Manish
Bapna, who leads the Natural Resources Defense Council. Carter called
for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions well before “climate change” was
part of the American lexicon, he said.</p>
<p>Wearing cardigans and setting standards</p>
<p>Former Vice President Al Gore, whose climate advocacy earned him the
2007 Nobel Peace Prize, called Carter “a lifelong role model for the
entire environmental movement.”</p>
<p>As president, Carter implemented the first U.S. efficiency standards
for passenger vehicles and household appliances. He created the U.S.
Department of Energy, which streamlined energy research, and more than
doubled the wilderness area under National Park Service protection.</p>
<p>Inviting ridicule, Carter asked Americans to conserve energy through
personal sacrifice, including driving less and turning down thermostats
in winter amid global fuel shortages. He pushed renewable energy to
lessen dependence on fossil fuels, calling for 20% of U.S. energy to
come from alternative sources by 2000.</p>
<p>But laments linger about what 39th president could not get done or
did not try before his landslide defeat to Ronald Reagan.</p>
<p>Addressing climate change</p>
<p>Carter left office in 1981 shortly after receiving a West Wing report
linking fossil fuels to rising carbon dioxide levels in Earth’s
atmosphere. Carter’s top environmental advisers urged “immediate”
cutbacks on the burning of fossil fuels to reduce what scientists at the
time called “carbon dioxide pollution.”</p>
<p>“Nobody anywhere in the world in a high government position was
talking about this problem” before Carter, biographer Jonathan Alter
said.</p>
<p>The White House released the findings, which drew forgettable news
coverage: The New York Times published its story on the 13th page of its
front section. And with scant time left in office, there were no
tangible moves Carter could make, beyond the energy legislation he had
already signed.</p>
<p>The report recommended limiting global average temperatures to 2
degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels.
Thirty-five years later, in the 2015 Paris climate accords,
participating nations set a similar goal.</p>
<p>“If he had been reelected, it’s fair to say that we would have been
beginning to address climate change in the early 1980s,” Alter told the
AP. “When you think about that, it adds a kind of a tragic dimension,
almost, to his political defeat.”</p>
<p>Reagan ended high-level conversations about carbon emissions. He
opposed efficiency standards as government overreach and rolled back
some regulations. His chief of staff, Don Regan, called the solar panels
“a joke.”</p>
<p>Pursuing energy independence</p>
<p>Despite Carter’s emphasis on renewable sources, the fossil fuel
industry benefited from his push toward U.S. energy independence.</p>
<p>Collin O’Mara, CEO of the National Wildlife Foundation, pointed to
coal-fired power plants built during and shortly thereafter Carter’s
term, and his deregulation of natural gas production, a move O’Mara
called “a precursor” to widespread fracking. Bapna noted Carter backed
drilling off the coasts of Long Island in New York and New England.</p>
<p>Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an
Energy-Efficient Economy, pointed to Carter’s Synthetic Fuels
Corporation, a short-lived effort to produce fossil fuel alternatives
that “would have meant much higher carbon emissions.”</p>
<p>But Carter had the right priorities, especially on research and
development coordinated through the Energy Department, Nadel said. “He
allowed us to have a national approach rather than one agency here and
another there.”</p>
<p>Stewarding God’s creation</p>
<p>Carter’s environmental interests had deep roots going back to a a
rural boyhood filled with hunting and fishing and working his father’s
farmland.</p>
<p>“Jimmy Carter was an environmentalist before it was a real part of
the political discussion — and I’m not talking about solar panels on the
White House,” said Dubose Porter, a longtime Georgia Democratic Party
leader. “Just focusing on that, misses how early and how committed he
was.”</p>
<p>His early years as a youth, influenced Carter as governor, Porter
said, when he boosted Georgia’s state parks system and opposed Georgia
congressmen who wanted to dam a river. Carter paddled the waterway
himself and decided its natural state trumped the lucrative federal
construction proposal.</p>
<p>In Washington, Carter continued sometimes unwinnable fights against
funding for projects he deemed damaging and unnecessary. He found more
success extending federal protection for more than 60.7 million
hectares, including redwood forests in California and vast swaths of
Alaska.</p>
<p>Randall Balmer, a Dartmouth College professor who has written on
Carter’s faith, said he saw himself as a custodian of divinely granted
natural resources.</p>
<p>“That’s a real connection that young evangelicals still have with him
today,” Balmer said.</p>
<p>Condemning consumerism</p>
<p>Carter won the presidency amid energy shortages rooted in global
strife, especially in the oil-rich Middle East, so national security and
economic interests dovetailed with Carter’s religious beliefs and
affinity for nature, Nadel noted.</p>
<p>Carter compared the energy crisis to “the moral equivalent of war,”
and as inflation and gas lines grew, he called for individual sacrifice
and sweeping action on renewable energy.</p>
<p>“Human identity is no longer defined by what one does, but by what
one owns,” Carter warned in 1979. “But we’ve discovered that owning
things and consuming things does not satisfy our longing for
meaning.”</p>
<p>That “malaise” speech — dubbed so by the media despite Carter not
using the word — was unique in presidential politics for its
condemnation of unchecked American consumerism. Carter celebrated that
more than 100 million Americans watched. By 2010, Carter acknowledged in
his annotated “White House Diary” that his speech was a flop, but said
it proved to be prescient for advocating bold and direct action on
energy.</p>
<p>“You can say the Carter presidency is still producing results today,”
said Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, whose 2020 presidential run focused on
climate action. “I’ve learned in politics that timing is everything and
serendipity is everything.”</p>

arrive in the Philippines to complete visa processing for resettlement
in US</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MANILA, Philippines — A group of Afghan nationals arrived in the
Philippines on Monday to process special immigrant visas for their
resettlement in the United States, as part of an agreement between
Manila and Washington.</p>
<p>The Philippines agreed last July to temporarily host a U.S. immigrant
visa processing center for a limited number of Afghan nationals aspiring
to resettle in America.</p>
<p>Department of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Teresita Daza said the
Afghan nationals who landed in the Philippines on Monday were provided
entry visas. She said they had completed extensive security vetting and
undergone full medical screenings prior to their arrival.</p>
<p>The U.S. government will cover the costs for the Afghan nationals’
stay in the Philippines, including their food, housing, security,
medical and transportation expenses, she said.</p>
<p>She didn’t specify how many Afghans arrived or how long the visa
processing will take. Under the Philippines’ rules, visa applicants can
stay for no longer than 59 days.</p>
<p>A senior Philippine official told The Associated Press last year that
only 150 to 300 applicants would be accommodated in the Philippines
under the “one-time” deal. The official who had knowledge of the
negotiations agreed to speak on condition of anonymity because of a lack
of authority to speak publicly.</p>
<p>The Afghan nationals seeking resettlement primarily worked for the
U.S. government in Afghanistan or were deemed eligible for U.S. special
immigrant visas but were left behind when Washington withdrew from the
country and Taliban militants took back power in a chaotic period in
2021.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken first relayed the request to
his Philippines counterpart in 2022, and President Joe Biden discussed
the request with Philippines leader Ferdinand Marcos Jr. when he visited
the U.S. last year, Philippine officials said.</p>
<p>Marcos has rekindled relations with the U.S. since winning the
presidency by a landslide margin two years ago. In February last year,
he allowed an expansion of the American military presence under a 2014
defense agreement in a decision that upset China.</p>

<h2 id="us-congress-to-certify-trumps-election-win">US Congress to
certify Trump’s election win</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. Congress is set to meet Monday to certify Donald Trump’s
presidential election victory over Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>The vice president is in charge of presiding over the count of
results from each of the country’s 50 states, putting Harris in the
position of certifying her own loss.</p>
<p>The procedure was long a formality in the election process, but four
years ago turned to chaos as Trump supporters stormed the Capitol,
injuring about 140 police officers, vandalizing the building and sending
lawmakers rushing for safety.</p>
<p>Similar scenes are not expected Monday, with Harris having conceded
defeat and President Joe Biden highlighting the need for a peaceful
process.</p>
<p>Authorities have prepared just in case, erecting tall metal barriers
around the Capitol complex.</p>
<p>Speaking Sunday at the White House, Biden called what happened on
Jan. 6, 2021 “one of the toughest days in American history.”</p>
<p>“We’ve got to get back to the basic, normal transfer of power,” Biden
said. </p>
<p>He added that Trump’s conduct four years ago, which included repeated
false claims that he won the election, “was a genuine threat to
democracy.”</p>
<p>“I’m hopeful we’re beyond that now,” Biden said.</p>
<p>More than 1,500 people have been charged in connection with storming
the Capitol.  Trump has pledged to quickly issue pardons after he takes
office on Jan. 20.</p>

<h2 id="the-brutalist-emilia-perez-triumph-at-golden-globes">‘The
Brutalist,’ ‘Emilia Perez’ triumph at Golden Globes</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Two wildly audacious films — Brady Corbet’s 215-minute postwar epic
“The Brutalist” and Jacques Audiard’s Spanish language, genre-shifting
trans musical “Emilia Perez” — won top honors at the 82nd Golden Globes
on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Globes, which are still finding their footing after years of
scandal and makeover, scattered awards around to a number of films. But
the awards group put its strongest support behind a pair of movies that
sought to be unlike anything else.</p>
<p>“The Brutalist” was crowned best film, drama, putting one of 2024’s
most ambitious films on course to be a major contender at the Academy
Awards. The film, shot in VistaVision and released with an intermission,
also won best director for Corbet and best actor for Adrien Brody.</p>
<p>“I was told that this film was un-distributable,” said Corbet. “No
one was asking for a three-and-half-hour film about a mid-century
designer in 70mm. But it works.”</p>
<p>“Emilia Perez” won best film, comedy or musical, elevating the Oscar
chances of Netflix’s top Oscar contender. It also won best supporting
actress for Zoe Saldaña, best song (“El Mal”) and best non-English
language film. Karla Sofia Gascon, the film’s transgender star who plays
a Mexican drug lord who undergoes gender-affirming surgery, spoke for
the film.</p>
<p>“The light always wins over darkness,” said Gascon, gesturing to her
brightly orange dress. “You can maybe put us in jail. You can beat us
up. But you never can take away our soul or existence or identity.”</p>
<p>“I am who I am. Not who you want.”</p>
<p>The night’s big actor winners included some surprises. One shocker
was Moore’s win for best actress in a comedy or musical. Her comeback
performance in “The Substance,” about a Hollywood star who resorts to an
experimental process to regain her youth, landed the 62-year-old Moore
her first Globe — a victory that came over the heavily favored Mikey
Madison of “Anora.”</p>
<p>“I’m just in shock right now. I’ve been doing this a long time, like
over 45 years, and this is the first thing I’ve ever won as an actor,”
said Moore, who was last nominated by the Globes for a film role in 1991
for “Ghost.” “Thirty years ago, I had a producer tell me that I was a
popcorn actress.”</p>
<p>Best actress, in a drama film, was a surprise, too. The Brazilian
actress Fernanda Torres won for her performance in “I’m Still Here,” a
based-on-a-true-story drama about a family living through the
disappearance of political dissident Rubens Paiva in 1970s Rio de
Janeiro.</p>
<p>Best supporting actor in a musical or comedy went to Sebastian Stan
for another movie about physical transformation: “A Different Man,” in
which Stan plays a man with a deformed face who’s healed. Stan, who was
also nominated for playing Donald Trump in “The Apprentice,” noted that
both films were hard to get made.</p>
<p>“These are tough subject matters but these films are real and they’re
necessary,” said Stan. “But we can’t be afraid and look away.”</p>
<p>Glaser lightly roasts the Globes</p>
<p>Comedian Nikki Glaser kicked off the Globes, with a promise: “I’m not
here to roast you.”</p>
<p>But Glaser, a stand-up whose breakthrough came in a withering roast
of Tom Brady, made her way around the ballroom of the Beverly Hilton in
Beverly Hills, California, on Sunday picking out plenty of targets in an
opening monologue she had worked out extensively in comedy clubs
beforehand.</p>
<p>While Glaser might not have reached Tina Fey and Amy Poehler levels
of laughs, the monologue was mostly a winner, and a dramatic improvement
over last year’s host, Jo Koy. Last year’s Globes, following a diversity
and ethics scandal that led to the dissolution of the Hollywood Foreign
Press Association, were widely panned, but delivered where it counted.
Ratings rebounded to about 10 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
CBS, who waded in after NBC dumped the Globes, signed up for five more
years.</p>
<p>Hosting the Globes two weeks before the inauguration of Donald Trump,
Glaser reserved perhaps her most cutting line for the whole room of
Hollywood stars.</p>
<p>“You could really do anything … except tell the country who to vote
for,” said Glaser. “But it’s OK, you’ll get ’em next time … if there is
one. I’m scared.”</p>
<p>The Globes are now owned by Todd Boehly’s Eldridge Industries and
Dick Clark Productions, which acquired the award show from the now
defunct Hollywood Foreign Press Association. After diversity and ethics
scandals, the HFPA sold off the Globes and dissolved. However, more than
a dozen former HFPA members are seeking to have the sale to Eldridge
Industries and Dick Clark Productions rescinded.</p>
<p>A win for ‘Wicked’</p>
<p>The Globes’ award for cinematic and box-office achievement went to
Jon M. Chu’s “Wicked,” which has nearly collected $700 million in
theaters. In a heavily arthouse Oscar field, “Wicked” is easily the
biggest hit seen as having a chance to win best picture. Accepting the
award, Chu argued for “a radical act of optimism” in art.</p>
<p>Though few film awards have been predictable this season, Kieran
Culkin is emerging as the clear favorite for best supporting actor.
Culkin won Sunday for his performance in Jesse Eisenberg’s “A Real
Pain,” his second Globe in the past year following a win for the HBO
series “Succession.” He called the Globes “basically the best date night
that my wife and I ever have,” and then thanked her for “putting up what
you call my mania.”</p>
<p>The papal thriller “Conclave” took best screenplay, for Peter
Straughan’s script. “Flow,” the wordless Latvian animated parable about
a cat in a flooded world, took best animated film, winning over studio
blockbusters like “Inside Out 2” and “The Wild Robot.” Trent Reznor and
Atticus Ross won best score for their thumping music for
“Challengers.”</p>
<p>TV prizes</p>
<p>Most of the TV winners were oft-awarded series, including the Emmy
champ “Shogun.” It won four awards, including best drama series and
acting wins for Hiroyuki Sanada, Anna Sawai and Tadanobu Asano. Other
repeat winners were: “Hacks” (best comedy series, actress for Jean
Smart), “The Bear” (Jeremy Allen White for best actor) and “Baby
Reindeer” (best limited series).</p>
<p>Ali Wong won for best stand-up performance, Jodie Foster for “True
Detective” and Colin Farrell for his physical transformation in “The
Penguin.”</p>
<p>“I guess it’s prosthetics from here on out,” said Farrell.</p>

<h2 id="sunday-school-class-with-jimmy-carter-what-it-was-like">Sunday
school class with Jimmy Carter: What it was like</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Plains, Georgia — It never got old. </p>
<p>No matter how many times one crammed into the modest sanctuary at
Maranatha Baptist Church, there was always some wisdom to be gleaned
from the measured, Bible-inspired words of Jimmy Carter. </p>
<p>This was another side of the 39th president, a down-to-earth man of
steadfast faith who somehow found time to teach Sunday school classes
when he wasn’t building homes for the needy, or advocating for fair
elections, or helping eradicate awful diseases. </p>
<p>For young and old, straight and gay, believers and nonbelievers,
Black and white and brown, Maranatha was a far-off-the-beaten path
destination in southwest Georgia where Carter, well into his 90s, stayed
connected with his fellow citizens of the world. </p>
<p>Anyone willing to make the trek to his hometown of Plains, with its
one blinking caution light and residents numbering in the hundreds, was
rewarded with access to a white-haired man who once occupied the highest
office in the land. </p>
<p>Carter taught his Sunday school class roughly twice a month to
accommodate crowds that sometimes swelled to more than 500. (On the
other Sundays, no more than a couple dozen regulars and a handful of
visitors usually attended services). </p>
<p>Here, the former commander-in-chief and the onetime first lady, his
wife of more than seven decades, were simply Mr. Jimmy and Ms. Rosalynn.
And when it came to worshipping with them, all were welcome. </p>
<p>Sundays with Mr. Jimmy </p>
<p>Before the former president entered the sanctuary, with a
bomb-sniffing dog outside and Secret Service agents scattered around, a
strict set of rules would be laid out by Ms. Jan — Jan Williams, a
longtime church member and friend of the Carters. She would have made
quite a drill sergeant. </p>
<p>It felt like a good-cop, bad-cop routine. Ms. Jan barking out rules
you knew had come straight from Mr. Jimmy, who studied nuclear physics
and approached all things with an engineer’s orderly mind. </p>
<p>Most important for those wanting a photo with the Carters — and
nearly everyone did — you had to stay for the main 11 a.m. church
service. Picture-taking began around noon. </p>
<p>If you left the church grounds before that, there was no coming back.
If you stayed, you followed rules. No autographs. No handshakes. No
attempts at conversation beyond a brief “good morning” or “thank
you.” </p>
<p>Carter, consistently in sports jacket, slacks and bolo tie, would
start his lesson by moving around the sanctuary, asking with a straight
face if there were any visitors — that always got a laugh — and where
they were from. In my many trips to Maranatha, I’m sure I heard all 50
states, not to mention an array of far-flung countries. </p>
<p>If anyone answered Washington, D.C., the answer was predictable. “I
used to live there,” the one-term president would say, breaking into
that toothy grin. </p>
<p>Carter’s Bible lessons focused on central themes: God gives life,
loves unconditionally and provides the freedom to live a completely
successful life. But the lesson usually began with an anecdote about
what he’d been up to or his perspective on world affairs. </p>
<p>Carter could talk about building homes with Habitat for Humanity or
bemoan U.S. conflicts since World War II. He could talk about his work
with The Elders, a group of former world leaders, or a trip out West to
go trout fishing with Ted Turner. He could talk about The Carter
Center’s successes in eliminating the guinea worm, or his long
friendships with Willie Nelson and Bob Dylan. </p>
<p>“Willie Nelson is an old friend. He used to come visit me in the
White House,” Carter related once, touching ever so gently on Nelson’s
affection for weed. </p>
<p>“I don’t know what Willie and my children did after I went to bed.
I’ve heard rumors,” the former president said, with a sly grin and a
wink that suggested he believed every word. </p>
<p>My favorite: Carter telling of his latest book project and how he had
long used encyclopedias for research. </p>
<p>Carter decided the collection was taking up too much space, so he
boxed it up and headed out to local schools and libraries, figuring
someone would eagerly take a donation from an ex-president. Instead, he
got a standard refrain: Sorry, no one uses encyclopedias anymore. </p>
<p>I recall the punchline. “How do I look up things now?” asked the man
born five years after World War I ended. Pause. Then: “Google.” </p>
<p>Memories of visits </p>
<p>During most of my visits to Maranatha, Carter spoke for 45 minutes
without sitting down. His mind remained sharp, with only an occasional
glance at the notes tucked inside his Bible, but his body became more
and more feeble as he moved deeper into his 90s. He talked openly about
the ravages of aging. </p>
<p>He resisted church members’ pleadings to take a seat while teaching.
I was there the first time he tried it, in August 2018. </p>
<p>“I’m uncomfortable sitting down,” he said, “but I guess I’ll get used
to it.” </p>
<p>Not that time. Carter sat for less than 10 minutes before rising. He
stood at the table for the rest of class. </p>
<p>Returning the following year, Carter had relented to using a white,
remote-controlled chair. After climbing aboard — voilà — a flick of a
switch would slowly lift him above the lectern, visible even to those
sitting in the back. </p>
<p>If there wasn’t enough room in the sanctuary, rows of folding chairs
were set up in the fellowship hall and a handful of tiny classrooms.
Carter’s lesson would be shown on TVs linked to a feed from the main
room. </p>
<p>A letdown for visitors? Perhaps. But relegation to a back room had
its benefits. </p>
<p>Carter, who usually arrived about 15 minutes before the start of his
10 a.m. lesson, would swing by these rooms before heading to the
sanctuary. He would even take a few questions, which didn’t happen in
front of the big crowd. </p>
<p>After a 2018 profile by The Washington Post told of the Carters
having regular Saturday night dinners at friend Jill Stuckey’s house,
which included one glass each of “bargain-brand Chardonnay,” I asked
Carter how many glasses of wine he’d had the night before. </p>
<p>“I’ll say one,” Carter replied with a sly grin. Stuckey, standing
behind him, shook her head and held up two fingers. </p>
<p>No matter where you sat — main sanctuary or back room — everyone got
their picture taken with Mr. Jimmy and Ms. Rosalynn. For many, this
seemed the biggest reward. </p>
<p>When we first started attending, those pictures were taken under a
tree just outside the church. After being diagnosed with cancer in 2015,
Carter and his wife would pose with visitors inside the sanctuary.
Carter liked to joke about what a burden it was to sit for all those
pictures, which surely numbered in the hundreds of thousands. </p>
<p>“I’ll be delighted to have photographs made with all of you,” he
quipped after one of his final lessons. “Actually, since I’m in church,
I better say I’ll be willing to have photographs made with all of
you.” </p>
<p>For my family, those pictures show a son growing from boy to man with
Mr. Jimmy and Ms. Rosalynn filling out the frames. What a treasure they
are. </p>
<p>The final lesson </p>
<p>Turnout for Carter’s Sunday school lessons dipped during the Great
Recession. But the crowds returned after his cancer announcement, with
some folks lining up outside the church the night before. </p>
<p>Carter declared himself cancer-free, but other health challenges
began to catch up with him. After an October 2019 fall at his home left
him with a slightly fractured pelvis, the church announced Carter would
not teach his next class on Nov. 3, a lesson we had planned to attend.
Disappointed, we canceled our hotel reservation. </p>
<p>But Mr. Jimmy wasn’t done just yet. </p>
<p>The church had canceled without checking with him. He made it clear
that he was NOT cancelling. We quickly rebooked. Carter’s lesson that
day, based on the Book of Job, was especially poignant in
retrospect. </p>
<p>“I’m going to start by asking you a very profound question,” he said.
“How many of you believe in life after death?” </p>
<p>Carter conceded to having doubts for most of his life, right up to
being stricken by cancer, which finally erased any skepticism. When the
end on this world came, he would be ready. </p>
<p>“We don’t have anything to dread after death,” Carter said with a
reassuring smile. </p>
<p>At the end of his lesson, he challenged everyone to do one good deed
for a stranger. “I’m going to hold you to it,” Carter promised. </p>
<p>He never got the chance. </p>
<p>His health continued to decline, sidelining him through the Christmas
season. Then, the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the world in 2020. </p>
<p>By that summer, it was clear that Mr. Jimmy’s treasured role as
spreader of the gospel, which he began at 18 and resumed after his
presidency, was over.</p>

id="tiktok-creators-in-us-left-in-limbo-while-awaiting-decision-on-potential-platform-ban">TikTok
creators in US left in limbo while awaiting decision on potential
platform ban</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Will TikTok in the U.S. be banned this month?</p>
<p>That’s the pressing question keeping creators and small business
owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision that could upend their
livelihoods. The fate of the popular app will be decided by the U.S.
Supreme Court, which will hear arguments on Jan. 10 over a law requiring
TikTok to break ties with its Chinese-based parent company, ByteDance,
or face a U.S. ban.</p>
<p>At the heart of the case is whether the law violates the First
Amendment with TikTok and its creator allies arguing that it does. The
U.S. government, which sees the platform as a national security risk,
says it does not.</p>
<p>For creators, the TikTok doomsday scenarios are nothing new since
President-elect Donald Trump first tried to ban the platform through
executive order during his first term. But despite Trump’s recent
statements indicating he now wants TikTok to stick around, the prospect
of a ban has never been as immediate as it is now with the Supreme Court
serving as the final arbiter.</p>
<p>If the government prevails as it did in a lower court, TikTok says it
would shut down its U.S. platform by Jan. 19, leaving creators
scrambling to redefine their futures.</p>
<p>“A lot of my other creative friends, we’re all like freaking out. But
I’m staying calm,” said Gillian Johnson, who benefited financially from
TikTok’s live feature and rewards program, which helped creators
generate higher revenue potential by posting high-quality original
content. The 22-year-old filmmaker and recent college graduate uses her
TikTok earnings to help fund her equipment for projects such as camera
lens and editing software for her short films “Gambit” and “Awaken! My
Neighbor.”</p>
<p>Johnson said the idea of TikTok going away is “hard to accept.”</p>
<p>Many creators have taken to TikTok to voice their frustrations,
grappling with the possibility that the platform they’ve invested so
much in could soon disappear. Online communities risk being disrupted,
and the economic fallout could especially be devastating for those who
mainly depend on TikTok and have left full-time jobs to build careers
and incomes around their content.</p>
<p>For some, the uncertainty has led them to question whether to
continue creating content at all, according to Johnson, who says she
knows creators who have been thinking about quitting. But Nicla Bartoli,
the vice president of sales at The Influencer Marketing Factory, said
the creators she has interreacted with have not been too worried since
news about a potential TikTok ban has come up repeatedly over the years,
and then died down.</p>
<p>“I believe a good chunk think it is not going to happen,” said
Bartoli, whose agency works to pair influencers and brands.</p>
<p>It’s unclear how quickly the Supreme Court will issue a decision. But
the court could act swiftly to block the law from going into effect if
at least five of the nine justices deem it unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Trump, for his part, has already asked the justices to put a pause on
the ban so he could weigh in after he takes office. In a brief — written
by his pick for solicitor general — Trump called the First Amendment
implications of a TikTok ban “sweeping and troubling” and said he wants
a “negotiated resolution” to the issue, something the Biden
administration had pursued to no avail.</p>
<p>While waiting for the dust to settle in Washington, some creators are
exploring alternatives ways to promote themselves or their business,
encouraging users to follow them on other social media platforms or are
investing more time producing non-TikTok content.</p>
<p>Johnson says she is already strategizing her next move and exploring
alternative opportunities. While she hasn’t found a place quite like
TikTok, she’s begun to spend more of her time on other platforms, such
as Instagram and YouTube, both of whom are expected to benefit
financially if TikTok vanishes.</p>
<p>According to a report by Goldman Sachs, the so-called creator
economy, which has been fueled in part by TikTok, could be worth $480
billion by 2027.</p>
<p>Because the opportunity to monetize content exists across a range of
platforms, a vast amount of creators have already diversified their
social media presence. However, many TikTok creators have credited the
platform — and its algorithm — with giving them a type of exposure they
did not receive on other platforms. Some say it has also boosted and
provided opportunities for creators of color and those from other
marginalized groups.</p>
<p>Despite fears about the fate of TikTok, industry analysts note
creators are generally avoiding making any big changes, like abandoning
platform, until something actually happens.</p>
<p>“I’m anxious but also trying to be hopeful in a weird way,” said
Brandon Hurst, who credits TikTok with rescuing his business from
obscurity and propelling it into rapid growth.</p>
<p>A year after joining TikTok, the 30-year-old Hurst, who sells plants,
said his sales doubled, outpacing the traction he’d struggled to gain on
Instagram. He built his clientele through the live feature on TikTok,
which has helped him sell more than 77,000 plants. The business has
thrived so much that he says he now employs five people, including his
husband and mom.</p>
<p>“For me, this has been my sole way of doing business,” Hurst
said.</p>
<p>Billion Dollar Boy, a New York-based influencer marketing agency, has
advised creators to download all of their TikTok content into a personal
portfolio, which is especially important for those who post primarily on
the platform, said Edward East, the agency’s founder and group CEO. This
can help them quickly build their audiences elsewhere. Plus, it can
serve as a resume for brands who might want to partner with them for
product advertisements, East said.</p>
<p>But until the deadline of Jan. 19 comes around, East said creators
should continue to post regularly on TikTok, which has 170 million
monthly U.S. users and remains highly effective in reaching
audiences.</p>
<p>If the Supreme Court does not delay the ban, as Trump is asking them
to do, app stores and internet service providers would be required to
stop providing service to TikTok by Jan. 19. That means anyone who
doesn’t have TikTok on their phone would be unable to download it.
TikTok users would continue to have access, but the prohibitions — which
will prevent them from updating the app — will eventually make the app
“unworkable,” the Justice Department has said.</p>
<p>TikTok said in court documents that it estimates a one-month shutdown
would cause the platform to lose approximately a third of its daily
users in the U.S. The company argues a shutdown, even if temporary, will
cause it irreparable harm, a legal bar used by judges to determine
whether to put the brakes on a law facing a challenge. In under three
weeks, Americans will know if the Supreme Court agrees.</p>

id="central-us-pummeled-by-snow-ice-as-major-storm-heads-east">Central
US pummeled by snow, ice as major storm heads east</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Dangerous wintry conditions descended Sunday on a large
swath of the central United States as a severe storm system tracked
eastward, prompting travel and work disruptions from Kansas City to
Washington.</p>
<p>Around a dozen states from Kansas to New Jersey were under winter
storm warnings Sunday afternoon, according to the National Weather
Service (NWS), while areas across the U.S. South faced possible tornado
and cold weather threats.</p>
<p>Nationwide, over 60 million people were under some sort of weather
alert, according to broadcaster CNN, while air traffic monitoring site
FlightAware showed almost 2,200 flight cancellations and over 25,000
delays.</p>
<p>Gusty winds from the storm system, the first of the year, brought
blizzard conditions to Kansas and Missouri, while states farther east
were blanketed in multiple inches of snow.</p>
<p>Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear implored residents to “please stay
home” after reporting multiple vehicle crashes had closed a major
highway.</p>
<p>The NWS also warned that accumulations of up to a half inch of ice in
some areas — as well as widespread tree damage from powerful wind gusts
— could lead to “prolonged power outages.”</p>
<p>A mix of freezing rain, sleet and snow began hitting Kansas early
Sunday morning. Storm chaser Brian Emfinger said on X that roads around
Kansas City were “a skating rink.”</p>
<p>Video posted by the Weather Channel showed cars skidding off
ice-coated highways and tractor trailers jack-knifing in Kansas, where
some areas were expecting more than 30 centimeters of snow.</p>
<p>“Areas of heavy snow will spread eastward through the Ohio Valley and
central Appalachians tonight, reaching the northern Mid-Atlantic by
Monday morning,” the NWS said in an update.</p>
<p>Areas around Washington could see up to 25 centimeters overnight from
Sunday into Monday, making “hazardous travel and closings” likely, The
Washington Post reported.</p>
<p>That could complicate the task of U.S. lawmakers, who by
constitutional mandate must meet on Capitol Hill on Jan. 6 to certify
the winner of last year’s presidential election.</p>
<p>“Whether we’re in a blizzard or not,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said
on Fox News Sunday, “we cannot delay that certification… I hope we have
full attendance.”</p>
<p>A joint session is to convene at 1:00 pm (1800 GMT) on Monday.</p>
<p>Bitter cold</p>
<p>With the jet stream diving southward, temperatures are expected to
plunge, in some places to minus 18 degrees Celsius, while strong wind
gusts compound the dangers.</p>
<p>The mercury could sink tens of degrees below seasonal norms down to
the U.S. Gulf Coast. Before then, severe thunderstorms are expected
across the lower Mississippi Valley, the NWS forecast.</p>
<p>Another major concern is freezing rain and sleet. A thick coating of
ice could make travel hazardous, bring down trees and topple electricity
lines.</p>
<p>The NWS predicted more than 1 centimeter of freezing rain over parts
of the Middle Mississippi and Ohio Valley area, and warned that
“long-lasting power outages” could leave millions of customers without
power from Kansas to the central Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>Conditions could prove especially perilous in Appalachia, where a
deadly hurricane in late September devastated communities and ravaged
multiple southeastern states including Kentucky.</p>
<p>The new storm “will likely cause significant disruption and dangerous
conditions on our roads and could cause significant power outages just
24 hours or so before it’s going to get really cold in Kentucky,”
Governor Andy Beshear told an emergency meeting.</p>
<p>The governors of Kentucky, Missouri and Virginia have declared a
state of emergency in their states, and have taken to social media to
warn residents to stay home.</p>

Davis, Ted Danson celebrated in film and TV at Golden Globes event</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Beverly Hills, California — Viola Davis’ journey to becoming one of
Hollywood’s most revered actors was driven by a straightforward mantra:
Embrace every role, using each as a paycheck and a chance to explore new
characters while honing her skills.</p>
<p>Davis delivered a moving, 16-minute speech while accepting the
prestigious Cecil B. DeMille Award at the Golden Gala: An Evening of
Excellence on Friday night. She reflected on how her turbulent
upbringing fueled her passion for acting as an escape and how financial
necessity often influenced her choice of roles.</p>
<p>“If I waited for a role that was written for me, well crafted, then I
wouldn’t be standing up here,” said Davis, who along with Ted Danson,
recipient of the Carol Burnett Award, were celebrated for their career
achievements in film and television during a star-studded, black-tie
gala dinner in Beverly Hills, California, just two nights before the
82nd annual Golden Globes on Sunday.</p>
<p>Some of the popular names in attendance included Carol Burnett, Jane
Fonda, Anthony Anderson, Steve Guttenberg and singer-songwriter Kenneth
“Babyface” Edmonds. It’s the first time the Globes hosted a separate
event dedicated to both awards.</p>
<p>Davis said she couldn’t afford to wait for the perfect role,
especially as a “dark-skinned Black woman with a wide nose and big
lips.”</p>
<p>“So I took it for the money,” said Davis, who won praise for a string
of compelling characters in films such as “Fences,” “The Woman King,”
“The Help” and “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” while captivating TV audiences
through the legal thriller drama “How to Get Away with Murder.”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe that poverty is really the answer to craft,” she
said. “I don’t think there’s any nobility in poverty.”</p>
<p>Meryl Streep presented the award to Davis, who she called a pure
artist who “delivers the truth every time.” Both actors worked together
in the 2008 film “Doubt,” where Streep first became in awe of Davis, who
she called her “favorite actor in the world.”</p>
<p>The DeMille Award has been bestowed on Hollywood’s greatest talents.
Past recipients include Tom Hanks, Jeff Bridges, Oprah Winfrey, Morgan
Freeman, Streep, Barbra Streisand and Sidney Poitier.</p>
<p>When Danson accepted his award, he congratulated Davis, calling her
an “amazing actor.”</p>
<p>“It’s such a pleasure to be in the same room with you,” said Danson,
a three-time Globes winner, who has been a fixture on TV since he broke
out as Boston bartender Sam Malone on NBC’s comedy “Cheers.” His other
credits include “The Good Place,” “Mr. Mayor,” “Fargo,” “CSI” and “CSI:
Cyber,” “Damages” and “Becker.”</p>
<p>Danson currently stars in Netflix’s “A Man on the Inside,” which
earned his first nomination since 2008 and 13th overall.</p>
<p>“Bia Iftikhar, who does his hair on set, said it best: ‘Ted sets the
tone,’” said his wife, actor Mary Steenburgen, who presented Danson with
the Carol Burnett Award, which was inaugurated in 2019. Past recipients
include Norman Lear, Ryan Murphy and Ellen DeGeneres. The first was
Burnett herself.</p>
<p>Danson and Steenburgen appeared in a few projects together including
“Pontiac Moon,” “Gulliver’s Travels” and “It Must Be Love.”</p>
<p>“He’s so loving and takes such joy in acting that all of us who are
hard at work away from our families for long hours get to work on a set
that is dictated by his kindness,” Steenburgen said. “As his wife,
watching the respect and love … for Ted, it made me very proud.”</p>
<p>Danson traded “I love you” with Burnett, showing admiration for each
other. He thanked a number of writers, producers and actors along with
the “Cheers” co-creators Glen and Les Charles, who surprised him by
showing up to the event.</p>
<p>“I feel so grateful,” he said. “I’m truly the luckiest… on
Earth.”</p>
<p>Davis quipped, “Little Viola is squealing,” referring to how her
younger self would be overjoyed at the actor’s journey from an
impoverished childhood to Hollywood stardom.</p>
<p>“She’s standing behind me and she’s pulling on my dress,” said Davis,
who achieved EGOT status after winning a Grammy last year for best audio
book, narration, and storytelling for the recording for her memoir
“Finding Me.”</p>
<p>“She’s wearing the same red rubber boots that she wore rain or shine
because they her feel ‘purty’” she continued. “What she’s whispering is:
‘I told you I was a magician.’”</p>
<p><br></p>

id="driving-into-manhattan-itll-cost-you-new-congestion-toll-starts-sunday">Driving
into Manhattan? It’ll cost you; new congestion toll starts Sunday</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — New York’s new toll for drivers entering the center of
Manhattan debuted Sunday, meaning many people will pay $9 to access the
busiest part of the Big Apple during peak hours. </p>
<p>The toll, known as congestion pricing, is meant to reduce traffic
gridlock in the densely packed city while also raising money to help fix
its ailing public transit infrastructure. </p>
<p>Drivers of most passenger cars will pay $9 to enter Manhattan south
of Central Park on weekdays between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. and on weekends
between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. During off hours, the toll will be $2.25 for
most vehicles. </p>
<p>After years of studies, delays and a last-ditch bid by New Jersey to
halt the toll, the program launched without major hiccups early Sunday.
But transit officials cautioned the first-in-the-nation scheme could
require adjustments — and likely would not get its first true test until
the workweek. </p>
<p>“This is a toll system that has never been tried before in terms of
complexity,” Metropolitan Transportation Authority Chair and CEO Janno
Lieber said at a news conference held at Grand Central Terminal Sunday.
“We don’t expect New Yorkers to overnight change their behavior.
Everybody’s going to have to adjust to this.” </p>
<p>The fee — which varies for motorcyclists, truck drivers and
ride-share apps — will be collected by electronic toll collection
systems at over 100 detection sites now scattered across the lower half
of Manhattan. </p>
<p>It comes on top of tolls drivers pay for crossing various bridges and
tunnels to get to the city in the first place, although there will be a
credit of up to $3 for those who have already paid to enter Manhattan
via certain tunnels during peak hours. </p>
<p>On Sunday morning, hours after the toll went live, traffic moved
briskly along the northern edge of the congestion zone at 60th Street
and 2nd Avenue. Many motorists appeared unaware that the newly activated
cameras, set along the arm of a steel gantry above the street, would
soon send a new charge to their E-Z Passes. </p>
<p>“Are you kidding me?” said Chris Smith, a realtor from Somerville,
New Jersey, as he drove against traffic beneath the cameras,
circumventing the charge. “Whose idea was this? Kathy Hochul? She should
be arrested for being ignorant.” </p>
<p>Some residents and transit riders, meanwhile, said they were hopeful
the program would lessen the bottlenecks and frequent honking in their
neighborhoods, while helping to modernize the subway system. </p>
<p>“I think the idea would be good to try to minimize the amount of
traffic down and try to promote people to use public transportation,”
said Phil Bauer, a surgeon who lives in midtown Manhattan, describing
the constant din of traffic in his neighborhood as “pretty brutal.” </p>
<p>President-elect Donald Trump, a Republican, has vowed to kill the
program when he takes office, but it’s unclear if he will follow
through. The plan had stalled during his first term while it waited on a
federal environmental review. </p>
<p>In November, Trump, whose namesake Trump Tower is in the toll zone,
said congestion pricing “will put New York City at a disadvantage over
competing cities and states, and businesses will flee.” </p>
<p>Lieber, the MTA head, said he was not overly concerned that the
president-elect would succeed in unwinding the program, even if he did
follow through. “I think he understands living on 59th and 5th Avenue
what traffic is doing to our city,” Lieber said Sunday. </p>
<p>Other big cities around the world, including London and Stockholm,
have similar congestion pricing schemes, but it is the first in the U.S.
Proponents of the idea note the programs were largely unpopular when
first implemented, gaining approval as the public felt benefits like
faster bus speeds and less traffic. </p>
<p>In New York City, even some transit riders voiced skepticism of a
plan intended to raise much-needed funds for the subway system. </p>
<p>“With my experience of the MTA and where they’ve allocated their
funds in the past, they’ve done a pretty poor job with that,” said
Christakis Charalambides, a supervisor in the fashion industry, as he
waited for a subway Sunday morning in Lower Manhattan. “I don’t know if
I necessarily believe it until I really see something.” </p>
<p>The toll was supposed to go into effect last year with a $15 charge,
but Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul abruptly paused the program before the
2024 election, when congressional races in suburban areas around the
city — the epicenter of opposition to the program — were considered to
be vital to her party’s effort to retake control of Congress. </p>
<p>Not long after the election, Hochul rebooted the plan at the lower $9
toll. She denies politics were at play and said she thought the original
$15 charge was too much, though she had been a vocal supporter of the
program before halting it. </p>
<p>Congestion pricing also survived several lawsuits seeking to block
the program, including a last-ditch effort from the state of New Jersey
to have a judge put up a temporary roadblock against it. New Jersey
Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, has vowed to continue fighting against the
scheme. </p>
<p>In response, Lieber described the New Jersey governor’s views as the
“definition of hypocrisy,” adding that he expected the state to adjust
its strategy after “losing again and again and again” in court.</p>

and ‘Sonic 3’ rule first box office weekend of 2025</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The Walt Disney Co.’s “Mufasa” claimed the No. 1 spot on the North
American box office charts over the first weekend of 2025.</p>
<p>The photorealistic “Lion King” prequel earned $23.8 million in its
third weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. Paramount’s “Sonic
the Hedgehog 3,” which has dominated the past two weekends, wasn’t far
behind.</p>
<p>“Sonic 3” stayed close with a 3-day estimate of $21.2 million,
bringing its total domestic earnings to $187.5 million and helping the
overall franchise cross $1 billion worldwide. “Mufasa’s” running total
is slightly less, with $169.2 million.</p>
<p>In third place, Focus Features’ “Nosferatu” remake defied the fate of
so many of its genre predecessors and fell only 39% in its second
weekend. Horror films typically fall sharply after the first weekend and
anything less than a 50% decline is notable.</p>
<p>“Nosferatu,” which added 140 screens, claimed $13.2 million in ticket
sales, bringing its running total to $69.4 million since its Christmas
debut. The film, directed by Robert Eggers, already surpassed its
reported production budget of $50 million, though that figure does not
account for marketing and promotion expenses.</p>
<p>No new wide releases opened this weekend, leaving the box office top
10 once again to holdovers from previous weeks. Several have been in
theaters since Thanksgiving. One of those, “Moana 2,” claimed the No. 4
spot for Disney in its sixth weekend in theaters. The animated sequel
earned another $12.4 million, bumping its global total to $960.5
million.</p>
<p>The Bob Dylan biopic “A Complete Unknown,” dipped only slightly in
its second weekend, bringing in $8.1 million. With $41.7 million total,
it’s Searchlight’s highest grossing film since Disney acquired the
company in 2019.</p>
<p>A24’s erotic drama “Babygirl,” which added 49 locations, held steady
at $4.5 million.</p>
<p>Another Thanksgiving leftover, “Wicked,” rounded out the top five.
Universal’s movie musical was made available to purchase on VOD on
Jan. 31, but still earned another $10.2 million from theaters. The movie
is up for several awards at Sunday’s Golden Globes, including
nominations for Cynthia Erivo, Ariana Grande, best motion picture
musical or comedy and “cinematic and box office achievement,” which last
year went to “Barbie.”</p>
<p>Also in theaters this weekend was the IMAX re-release of David
Fincher’s 4K restoration of “Seven,” which earned just over $1 million
from 200 locations.</p>
<p>The 2025 box office year is already off to a better start than 2024,
up around 20% from the same weekend last year.</p>
<p>Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket
sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according
to Comscore:</p>

storm will not delay Trump election certification in Congress, House
leader says</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — A massive winter storm moving across the United States
will not keep the U.S. Congress from meeting on Monday to formally
certify Republican Donald Trump’s election as president, Republican
House Speaker Mike Johnson said on Sunday. </p>
<p>“The Electoral Count Act requires this on January 6 at 1 p.m. - so,
whether we’re in a blizzard or not we’re going to be in that chamber
making sure this is done,” Johnson told Fox News’ “Sunday Morning
Futures” in an interview.</p>
<p>Johnson said he hoped there would be full attendance despite the
storm and that he had encouraged lawmakers to stay in the city.  </p>
<p>Forecasts called for heavy snow and high winds from the Central
Plains to the mid-Atlantic states, the National Weather Service said.
Severe weather advisories were issued across the eastern half of the
country, including blizzard warnings in parts of Kansas. </p>
<p>In Washington, mixed snow and sleet accumulations were expected to be
between 7 to 18 cm, promising a difficult commute and possible closings
of schools, government and businesses.  </p>
<p>Bad winter weather can wreak havoc in the Washington metropolitan
area, which has seen mild winters in recent decades and has at times
been unprepared for accumulations of snow or ice. </p>
<p>Members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives returned to
Washington on Friday after the winter break and Republicans gathered on
Saturday with Johnson to discuss legislative priorities. Republicans won
control of both the chambers in November’s election. </p>
<p>Other leaders stressed they were not contemplating a weather
delay. </p>
<p>“No change to the schedule,” said Lauren Fine, communications
director for Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. </p>
<p>The certification process, usually a formality, was upended four
years ago when supporters of Trump violently stormed the U.S. Capitol in
a bid to halt the transfer of power to Democrat Joe Biden, who won the
2020 election. </p>
<p>Trump has continued to falsely claim his 2020 defeat was the result
of widespread fraud. Biden and the Democrats say they will honor the
2024 election results and proceed with certification.</p>

id="new-orleans-attack-vegas-explosion-highlight-extremist-violence-by-active-military-and-veterans">New
Orleans attack, Vegas explosion highlight extremist violence by active
military and veterans</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>While much remains unknown about the man who carried out an attack in
New Orleans on New Year’s and another who died in an explosion in Las
Vegas the same day, the violence highlights the increased role of people
with military experience in ideologically driven attacks, especially
those that seek mass casualties.</p>
<p>In New Orleans, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a veteran of the U.S. Army, was
killed by police after a deadly rampage in a pickup truck that left 14
others dead and injured dozens more. It’s being investigated as an act
of terrorism inspired by the Islamic State group.</p>
<p>In Las Vegas, officials say Matthew Livelsberger, an active duty
member of the U.S. Army Special Forces, shot himself in the head in a
Tesla Cybertruck packed with firework mortars and camp fuel canisters,
shortly before it exploded outside the entrance of the Trump
International Hotel, injuring seven people. On Friday, investigators
said Livelsberger wrote that the explosion was meant to serve as a
“wakeup call” and that the country was “terminally ill and headed toward
collapse.”</p>
<p>Service members and veterans who radicalize make up a tiny fraction
of a percentage point of the millions who have honorably served their
country. But an Associated Press investigation published last year found
that radicalization among both veterans and active duty service members
was on the rise and that hundreds of people with military backgrounds
had been arrested for extremist crimes since 2017. The AP found that
extremist plots they were involved in during that period had killed or
injured nearly 100 people.</p>
<p>The AP also found multiple issues with the Pentagon’s efforts to
address extremism in the ranks, including that there is still no
force-wide system to track it, and that a cornerstone report on the
issue contained old data, misleading analyses and ignored evidence of
the problem.</p>
<p>Since 2017, both veterans and active duty service members radicalized
at a faster rate than people without military backgrounds, according to
data from terrorism researchers at the National Consortium for the Study
of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, or START, at the University of
Maryland. Less than 1% of the adult population is currently serving in
the U.S. military, but active duty military members make up a
disproportionate 3.2% of the extremist cases START researchers found
between 2017 and 2022.</p>
<p>While the number of people with military backgrounds involved in
violent extremist plots remains small, the participation of active
military and veterans gave extremist plots more potential for mass
injury or death, according to data collected and analyzed by the AP and
START.</p>
<p>More than 480 people with a military background were accused of
ideologically driven extremist crimes from 2017 through 2023, including
the more than 230 arrested in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021,
insurrection — 18% of those arrested for the attack as of late last
year, according to START. The data tracked individuals with military
backgrounds, most of whom were veterans, involved in plans to kill,
injure or inflict damage for political, social, economic or religious
goals.</p>
<p>The AP’s analysis found that plots involving people with military
backgrounds were more likely to involve mass casualties, weapons
training or firearms than plots that didn’t include someone with a
military background. This held true whether or not the plots were
carried out.</p>
<p>The jihadist ideology of the Islamic State group apparently connected
to the New Orleans attack would make it an outlier in the motivations of
previous attacks involving people with military backgrounds. Only around
9% of such extremists with military backgrounds subscribed to jihadist
ideologies, START researchers found. More than 80% identified with
far-right, anti-government or white supremacist ideologies, with the
rest split among far-left or other motivations.</p>
<p>Still, there have been a number of significant attacks motivated by
the Islamic State and jihadist ideology in which the attackers had U.S.
military backgrounds. In 2017, a U.S. Army National Guard veteran who’d
served in Iraq killed five people in a mass shooting at the Fort
Lauderdale airport in Florida after radicalizing via jihadist message
boards and vowing support for the Islamic State. In 2009, an Army
psychiatrist and officer opened fire at Fort Hood, Texas, and killed 13
people, wounding dozens more. The shooter had been in contact with a
known al-Qaida operative prior to the shooting.</p>
<p>In the shadow of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol — led in part by
veterans — law enforcement officials said the threat from domestic
violent extremists was one of the most persistent and pressing terror
threats to the United States. The Pentagon has said it is “committed to
understanding the root causes of extremism and ensuring such behavior is
promptly and appropriately addressed and reported to the proper
authorities.”</p>
<p>Kristofer Goldsmith, an Army veteran and CEO of Task Force Butler
Institute, which trains veterans to research and counter extremism, said
the problem of violent extremism in the military cuts across ideological
lines. Still, he said, while the Biden administration tried to put in
place efforts to address it, Republicans in Congress opposed them for
political reasons.</p>
<p>“They threw, you know, every roadblock that they could in saying that
all veterans are being called extremists by the Biden administration,”
Goldsmith said. “And now we’re in a situation where we’re four years
behind where we could have been.”</p>
<p>During their long military careers, both Jabbar and Livelsberger
served time at the U.S. Army base formerly known as Fort Bragg in North
Carolina, one of the nation’s largest military bases. One of the
officials who spoke to the AP said there is no overlap in their
assignments at the base, now called Fort Liberty.</p>
<p>Goldsmith said he is concerned that the incoming Trump administration
will focus on the New Orleans attack and ISIS and ignore that most
deadly attacks in the United States in recent history have come from the
far right, particularly if Trump’s nominee for defense secretary, Pete
Hegseth, is confirmed.</p>
<p>Hegseth has justified the medieval Crusades that pitted Christians
against Muslims, criticized the Pentagon’s efforts to address extremism
in the ranks and ahead of Joe Biden’s inauguration in the weeks after
the Jan. 6 attack was himself flagged by a fellow National Guard member
as a possible “insider threat.”</p>

<h2 id="fraud-allegations-rock-south-korean-adoptees-and-families">Fraud
allegations rock South Korean adoptees and families</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Her greatest fear, dormant for decades, came rushing back in an
instant: had she adopted and raised a kidnapped child?</p>
<p>Peg Reif’s daughter, adopted from South Korea in the 1980s, had sent
her a link to a documentary detailing how the system that made their
family was rife with fraud: documents falsified, babies switched,
children snatched off the street and sent abroad.</p>
<p>Reif wept.</p>
<p>She was among more than 120 who contacted The Associated Press this
fall, after a series of stories and a documentary made with Frontline
exposed how Korea created a baby pipeline, designed to ship children
abroad as quickly as possible to meet Western demand. The reporting
shook adoption communities around the world with details about how
agencies competed for babies — pressuring mothers, bribing hospitals,
fabricating documents. Most who wrote were adoptees, but some were
adoptive parents like Reif, horrified to learn they had supported this
system.</p>
<p>“I can’t stand the thought that somebody lost their child,” Reif
said. “I can’t stop thinking about it. I don’t know how to make it
right. I don’t know if I can.”</p>
<p>Forty years ago, she was struggling with infertility. She and her
husband pinned their dreams for a family on adopting a baby from Mexico,
paid an agency thousands of dollars and waited for months. Then the
agency’s directors were arrested, and they learned that those Mexican
babies had been taken from their families against their will. Reif was
heartbroken but recalls even now looking at her husband and saying,
“Thank God we don’t have a child who was stolen.”</p>
<p>But now she isn’t sure of that. Because then they adopted two Korean
children, and brought them to their home in rural Wisconsin, first a son
and then a daughter. The two were not biological siblings, but both
arrived with strangely similar stories in their files: their young
unmarried mothers worked in factories with fathers who disappeared after
they got pregnant.</p>
<p>Back then, Reif still believed the common narrative about foreign
adoption: it saved children who might otherwise live the rest of their
lives in an orphanage, die or be damned to poverty.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe that anymore,” Reif said. “I don’t know what to
believe.”</p>
<p>Cameron Lee Small, a therapist in Minneapolis whose practice caters
to adoptees and their families, said many are feeling an intense sense
of betrayal. Individual adoptees had long shared stories of falsified
identities. But the revelations this year pointed to systemwide
practices that routinely changed babies’ origin stories to process
adoptions quickly, including listing them as “abandoned” even when they
had known parents.</p>
<p>Small, who was also adopted from Korea in the 1980s, summarized what
he’s been hearing from adoptees: “I’m kind of back to nothing. What do I
believe now? Who can I believe?”</p>
<p>Reif’s daughter, Jenn Hamilton, spent her life thinking she was
unwanted, often quipping, “That’s what happens when you’re found in a
dumpster as a baby.”</p>
<p>It has taken a toll on her all her life: She’s been happily married
for nine years, she said, but she has this insatiable insecurity: “I
constantly find myself asking my husband, ‘Are you mad at me? Did I do
something wrong?’ Do you want to leave me?’”</p>
<p>She has no idea anymore if abandonment was ever really her story,
with revelations of abuses so systemic that even the Korean government
likened it to “trafficking.”</p>
<p>“You can’t make that many mistakes. It has to be intentional. It was
this huge tree of deception,” she said. “I feel disgusted.”</p>
<p>Holt International, the U.S.-based agency that pioneered adoptions
from Korea, did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this
story.</p>
<p>Reform is sweeping across Europe — countries have launched
investigations, halted foreign adoptions and apologized to adoptees for
failing to protect them. But the United States, which has taken in the
most adopted children by far, has not done a review of its own history
or culpability.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department told AP this summer that it would work with
its historian to piece together its history, and detailed initial
findings that some documents might have been falsified. But it said
there was no evidence that U.S. officials were aware of it. The State
Department has since said that it has “been unable to identify any
records that could provide insight into the U.S. government role in
adoptions from South Korea in the 1970s and 1980s.”</p>
<p>Korea’s National Police Agency confirmed an increase in adoptees
registering their DNA for family searches — both at domestic police
stations and diplomatic offices across North America and Europe — in the
weeks following the release of the AP stories and documentary in
September. More than 120 adoptees registered their DNA in October and
November, compared to an average of fewer than 30 a month from January
to August.</p>
<p>Korea’s government has maintained that adoptions were a necessary
tool to care for needy children, including babies of unwed mothers or
other children deemed as abandoned. However, Korea’s Ministry of Health
and Welfare acknowledged to AP that the adoption boom in the 1970s and
80s was possibly fueled by a desire to reduce welfare costs.</p>
<p>Korea’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission has been investigating
government accountability over foreign adoption problems since 2022,
prompted by complaints filed by hundreds of adoptees, and is expected to
release an interim report in February. The Commission has posted the AP
stories on its website.</p>
<p>A law passed in 2023 mandates that all adoption records be
transferred from private agencies to a government department called the
National Center for the Rights of the Child by July, to centralize the
handling of family search requests. The center has confirmed that
private agencies hold about 170,000 adoption files, but director Chung
Ick-Joong doubts it will acquire a space to store and manage all these
records in time, due to financial constraints and other challenges. The
agency expects family search requests to increase dramatically –
“possibly by tenfold,” according to Chung — yet has funding to add only
five staff members to its team of six searchers.</p>
<p>Chung acknowledged that flaws in adoption laws had persisted for
decades, and Korea only required adoptions to go through courts and
birth records to be preserved after 2012.</p>
<p>“It’s difficult to determine who was responsible for the inaccuracies
in records before then,” he said. “The adoption agency might have been
at fault, the biological parents may have lied, or something might have
gone wrong at the orphanage … no one truly knows what the truth is.”</p>
<p>Korean adoption agencies have mostly declined AP’s requests for
comment in recent months, often citing privacy concerns.</p>
<p>Advocates insist that most adoptive families thrive, with both the
parents and children happily living their lives without questioning the
industry as Reif and Hamilton have.</p>
<p>Hamilton grew up in a rural, almost exclusively white community in
Wisconsin, and back then all she wanted was to be accepted. But having
children of her own changed that. When her first child was born, she
looked at him, and it took her breath away.</p>
<p>“It can’t explain it, like this is the first person I know in my life
that I’m biologically related to,” she said.</p>
<p>She wanted to learn her own history, so her children could know
theirs. She wrote a letter to her adoption agency, which within weeks
connected her with a woman they said was her mother. It was emotional,
shocking.</p>
<p>But soon she felt like she had more questions than answers. The
woman’s name didn’t match the one listed on paperwork, and the name she
gave for the father was also different. Birthdates didn’t match, the
birthplace didn’t either. They had not met in a factory, she said, they
had been pen pals.</p>
<p>Hamilton asked the woman to take a DNA test, but she said she didn’t
know how to access one. Hamilton came to believe this woman was not her
birth mother.</p>
<p>The AP’s reporting found numerous cases where agencies connected
adoptees with supposed birth families, only for them to later discover
after emotional meetings that they weren’t related at all.</p>
<p>Hamilton has been trying to untangle the DNA results on her father’s
side, contacting people distantly related, cousins once removed, half
great aunts.</p>
<p>“It becomes an obsession,” Hamilton said. “It’s like a puzzle that
you start, and you have to find the missing pieces.”</p>
<p>Lynelle Long, the founder of InterCountry Adoptee Voices, the largest
organization of adoptees in the world, said governments at the very
least need to legally mandate that agencies provide adoptees with their
full and redacted documents, without the payment now often required.</p>
<p>Long said parents like Reif have an important role, because in
Western countries, laws always favored the desires of adoptive parents —
designed to make adoptions quicker and easier. Many clung to the
narrative that they saved needy orphans who should be grateful, she
said, especially in the U.S., where the reckoning rocking Europe has not
taken hold.</p>
<p>“We really need adoptive parents in the United States, if they have
any inkling of guilt or shame or loss, to step up, take responsibility
and demand that legislation be put in place to criminalize these
practices and prevent it from ever happening again,” Long said.</p>
<p>Hamilton is close to her parents; she just renovated the basement to
accommodate their visits. She’s sad for herself, she said, but she’s
sadder for her mother, who is desperate to learn if her children
actually had parents somewhere, searching for them.</p>
<p>“And I’m like, ’Why, so you can send us back?” Hamilton said. “I
don’t want to be a victim.”</p>
<p>She said she’s glad she was adopted, and does not long for that
different, alternative life in Korea.</p>
<p>Reif loves her children profoundly, she said. But she doesn’t think
she would adopt from abroad again, if she’d known then what she knows
now.</p>
<p>“I’d rather be childless than think I have somebody else’s child that
didn’t want to give them up,” she said. “I think of somebody taking my
child. Those poor families, I just can’t imagine it.”</p>

<h2 id="our-county-ignored-africa-jimmy-carter-said.-he-didnt">‘Our
county ignored Africa,’ Jimmy Carter said. He didn’t</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NAIROBI, KENYA — Jimmy Carter was the first U.S. president to make a
state visit to sub-Saharan Africa. He once called helping with
Zimbabwe’s transition from white rule to independence “our greatest
single success.” And when he died at 100, his foundation’s work in rural
Africa had nearly fulfilled his quest to eliminate a disease that
afflicted millions, for the first time since the eradication of
smallpox.</p>
<p>The African continent, a booming region with a population rivaling
China’s that is set to double by 2050, is where Carter’s legacy remains
most evident. Until his presidency, U.S. leaders had shown little
interest in Africa, even as independence movements swept the region in
the 1960s and ’70s.</p>
<p>“I think the day of the so-called ugly American is over,” Carter said
during his warm 1978 reception in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous
country. He said the official state visit swept aside “past aloofness by
the United States,” and he joked that he and Nigerian President Olesegun
Obasanjo would go into peanut farming together.</p>
<p>Cold War tensions drew Carter’s attention to the continent as the
U.S. and Soviet Union competed for influence. But Carter also drew on
the missionary traditions of his Baptist faith and the racial injustice
he witnessed in his homeland in the U.S. South.</p>
<p>“For too long our country ignored Africa,” Carter told the Democratic
National Committee in his first year as president.</p>
<p>African leaders soon received invitations to the White House,
intrigued by the abrupt interest from the world’s most powerful nation
and what it could mean for them.</p>
<p>“There is an air of freshness which is invigorating,” visiting
Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda said.</p>
<p>Carter observed after his first Africa trip, “There is a common theme
that runs through the advice to me of leaders of African nations: ‘We
want to manage our own affairs. We want to be friends with both of the
great superpowers and also with the nations of Europe. We don’t want to
choose up sides.’”</p>
<p>The theme echoes today as China also jostles with Russia and the U.S.
for influence, and access to Africa’s raw materials. But neither
superpower has had an emissary like Carter, who made human rights
central to U.S. foreign policy and made 43 more trips to the continent
after his presidency, promoting Carter Center projects that sought to
empower Africans to determine their own futures.</p>
<p>As president, Carter focused on civil and political rights. He later
broadened his efforts to include social and economic rights as the key
to public health.</p>
<p>“They are the rights of the human by virtue of their humanity. And
Carter is the single person in the world that has done the most for
advancing this idea,” said Abdullahi Ahmed An-Naim, a Sudanese legal
scholar.</p>
<p>Even as a candidate, Carter mused about what he might accomplish,
telling Playboy magazine, “it might be that now I should drop my
campaign for president and start a crusade for black-majority rule in
South Africa or Rhodesia [now Zimbabwe]. It might be that later on,
we’ll discover there were opportunities in our lives to do wonderful
things and we didn’t take advantage of them.”</p>
<p>Carter welcomed Zimbabwe’s independence just four years later,
hosting new Prime Minister Robert Mugabe at the White House and quoting
the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.: “Injustice anywhere is a threat to
justice everywhere.”</p>
<p>“Carter told me that he spent more time on Rhodesia than he did on
the entire Middle East. And when you go into the archives and look at
the administration, there is indeed more on southern Africa than the
Middle East,” historian and author Nancy Mitchell said.</p>
<p>Relations with Mugabe’s government soon soured amid deadly repression
and by 1986 Carter led a walkout of diplomats in the capital. In 2008,
Carter was barred from Zimbabwe, a first in his travels. He called the
country “a basket case, an embarrassment to the region.”</p>
<p>“Whatever the Zimbabwean leadership may think of him now,
Zimbabweans, at least those who were around in the 1970s and ’80s, will
always regard him as an icon and a tenacious promoter of democracy,”
said Eldred Masunungure, a Harare-based political analyst.</p>
<p>Carter also criticized South Africa’s government for its treatment of
Black citizens under apartheid, at a time when South Africa was “trying
to ingratiate itself with influential economies around the world,”
current President Cyril Ramaphosa said on X after Carter’s death.</p>
<p>The think tank Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter founded in 1982 played a key
role in monitoring African elections and brokering ceasefires between
warring forces, but fighting disease was the third pillar of The Carter
Center’s work.</p>
<p>“The first time I came here to Cape Town, I almost got in a fight
with the president of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, because he was refusing
to let AIDS be treated,” Carter told a local newspaper. “That’s the
closest I’ve come to getting into a fist fight with a head of
state.”</p>
<p>Carter often said he was determined to outlive the last guinea worm
infecting the human race. Once affecting millions of people, the
parasitic disease has nearly been eliminated, with just 14 cases
documented in 2023 in a handful of African countries.</p>
<p>Carter’s quest included arranging a four-month “guinea worm
cease-fire” in Sudan in 1995 so that The Carter Center could reach
almost 2,000 endemic villages.</p>
<p>“He taught us a lot about having faith,” said Makoy Samuel Yibi, who
leads the guinea worm eradication program for South Sudan’s health
ministry and grew up with people who believed the disease was simply
their fate. “Even the poor people call these people poor, you see. To
have the leader of the free world pay attention and try to uplift them
is a touching virtue.”</p>
<p>Such dedication impressed health officials in Africa over the
years.</p>
<p>“President Carter worked for all humankind irrespective of race,
religion, or status,” Ethiopia’s former health minister, Lia Tadesse,
said in a statement shared with the AP. Ethiopia, the continent’s second
most populous country with over 110 million people, had zero guinea worm
cases in 2023.</p>

id="italys-meloni-boosts-ties-with-trump-in-surprise-florida-visit">Italy’s
Meloni boosts ties with Trump in surprise Florida visit</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni made
a surprise trip to Florida to meet with Donald Trump late on Saturday,
as the key European leader sought to buttress ties with the
president-elect before his inauguration on January 20. </p>
<p>Members of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort welcomed Meloni with applause
after an introduction by the president-elect, according to videos shared
on social media by reporters and others. </p>
<p>“This is very exciting. I’m here with a fantastic woman, the prime
minister of Italy,” Trump told the Mar-a-Lago crowd, according to a
media pool report. “She’s really taken Europe by storm.” </p>
<p>Meloni is seen as a potentially strong partner for Trump given her
conservative credentials and the stability of the right-wing coalition
she has led in Italy since late 2022. </p>
<p>She has also forged a close relationship with billionaire tech CEO
Elon Musk, a close Trump ally who spent more than a quarter of a billion
dollars to help him win the election. </p>
<p>Tommaso Foti, Italy’s EU and regional affairs minister, said on
Sunday that the meeting, which had not been announced in advance, showed
that Italy could act as “a diplomatic bridge between two worlds: the
European Union and the USA.” </p>
<p>Meloni’s trip comes days before she is to meet U.S. President Joe
Biden during a visit to Rome from Thursday to Jan. 12. Trump defeated
Biden in the November election and is preparing to return to the White
House. </p>
<p>While no details of their meeting have been disclosed, Meloni had
planned to talk with Trump about Russia’s war in Ukraine, trade issues,
the Middle East and the plight of an Italian journalist detained in
Tehran, according to Italian media reports. </p>
<p>Trump and Meloni watched a screening of a documentary questioning the
criminal investigations and legal scrutiny faced by John Eastman, a
former Trump lawyer who was central to Trump’s unsuccessful efforts to
overturn his 2020 election loss. </p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges facing Meloni is the arrest of Italian
journalist Cecilia Sala in Iran on Dec. 19. </p>
<p>Sala was detained three days after Mohammad Abedini, an Iranian
businessman, was arrested at Milan’s Malpensa airport on a U.S. warrant
for allegedly supplying drone parts that Washington says were used in a
2023 attack that killed three U.S. service members in Jordan. Iran has
denied involvement in the attack. </p>
<p>Meloni became the latest in the handful of foreign leaders who have
visited Trump in Florida since the Nov. 5 election. He has met with
Argentinian President Javier Milei, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of
Hungary, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.</p>

<h2
id="jimmy-carters-state-funeral-has-started.-heres-what-to-know">Jimmy
Carter’s state funeral has started. Here’s what to know</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ATLANTA, GEORGIA — Six days of funeral observances for former
President Jimmy Carter began Saturday in Georgia, where he died on
Dec. 29 at the age of 100.</p>
<p>The first events reflected Carter’s climb up the political ladder,
from the tiny town of Plains, Georgia, to decades on the global stage as
a humanitarian and advocate for democracy.</p>
<p>Here is what to know about the initial ceremonies and what happens
next:</p>
<p>The start honors Carter’s deep roots in rural south Georgia</p>
<p>The proceedings began at 10:15 a.m. local time Saturday with the
Carter family arriving at Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in Americus.</p>
<p>Former Secret Service agents who protected Carter served as
pallbearers, walking alongside the hearse as it exited the campus on its
way to Plains.</p>
<p>James Earl Carter Jr. lived more than 80 of his 100 years in and
around the town, which still has fewer than 700 people, not much more
than when he was born on Oct. 1, 1924. Some other modern presidents —
Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton — also grew up in
small-town settings but Carter stands out for returning and remaining in
his birthplace for his long post-presidency.</p>
<p>The motorcade moved through downtown Plains, which spans just a few
blocks, passing near the girlhood home of former first lady Rosalynn
Smith Carter, who died in November 2023 at the age of 96, and near where
the couple operated the family peanut warehouses. The route also
included the old train depot that served as Jimmy Carter’s 1976
presidential campaign headquarters and the gas station once run by
Carter’s younger brother, Billy.</p>
<p>The motorcade passed by the Methodist church where the Carters
married in 1946, and the home where they lived and died. The former
president will be buried there alongside Rosalynn.</p>
<p>The Carters built the one-story house, now surrounded by Secret
Service fencing, before his first state Senate campaign in 1962 and
lived out their lives there with the exception of four years in the
Governor’s Mansion and four more in the White House.</p>
<p>A stop at Carter’s boyhood home — a blend of privilege, hard work</p>
<p>After going through Plains, the procession stopped in front of
Carter’s family farm and boyhood home in Archery, just outside the town,
after passing the cemetery where the former president’s parents, James
Earl Carter Sr. and Lillian Carter, are buried.</p>
<p>The farm now is part of the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park.
The National Park Service rang the old farm bell 39 times to honor the
39th president.</p>
<p>Carter was the first president born in a hospital. But the home had
no electricity or running water when he was born, and he worked his
father’s land during the Great Depression. Still, the Carters had
relative privilege and status. Earl employed Black tenant farming
families. The elder Carter also owned a store in Plains and was a local
civic and political leader. Lillian was a nurse and she delivered
Rosalynn. The property still includes a tennis court Earl had built for
the family.</p>
<p>It was Earl’s death in 1953 that set Jimmy on course toward the Oval
Office. The younger Carters had left Plains after he graduated from the
U.S. Naval Academy. But Jimmy abandoned a promising career as a
submarine officer and early participant in the Pentagon’s nuclear
program to take over the family’s peanut business after his father’s
death. Within a decade, he was elected to the Georgia state Senate.</p>
<p>Lying in repose in Atlanta, where Carter was a politician and global
figure</p>
<p>From Archery, the motorcade headed north to Atlanta. The military-run
motorcade stopped outside the Georgia Capitol, where Carter served as a
state senator from 1963-67 and governor from 1971-75. Georgia Gov. Brian
Kemp and Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens led a moment of silence. While
former governors are honored with state-run funerals, presidents — even
if they served as governors — are memorialized with national rites run
by the federal government.</p>
<p>The motorcade then proceeded to the Carter Presidential Center, which
includes Carter’s presidential library and The Carter Center,
established by the former president and first lady in 1982. Carter’s
son, James Earl “Chip” Carter III, and his grandson, Jason Carter, spoke
to an assembly that included many Carter Center employees whose work
concentrating on international diplomacy and mediation, election
monitoring, and fighting disease in the developing world continues to
set a standard for what former presidents can accomplish.</p>
<p>Jimmy Carter, who delivered the center’s annual reports until 2019,
won the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize in part for this post-presidential
work.</p>
<p>Carter was scheduled to lie in repose from 7 p.m. Saturday to 6 a.m.
Tuesday, with the public able to pay respects around the clock.</p>
<p>What’s next: A return to Washington</p>
<p>Carter’s remains will travel next to Washington, where he will lie in
state in the Capitol Rotunda until his funeral at 10 a.m. Thursday at
the Washington National Cathedral. All the living presidents have been
invited, and Joe Biden, a Carter ally, will deliver a eulogy. Biden also
signed a bill to name a U.S. Postal Service facility in Plains after
Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter.</p>
<p>The Carter family then will return to bury its patriarch in Plains
after a private hometown funeral at 3:45 p.m. at Maranatha Baptist
Church, where Carter, a devout evangelical, taught Sunday School for
decades.</p>
<p>Carter will be buried afterward in a private graveside service, in a
plot visible from the front porch of his home.</p>

<h2 id="feds-kugler-daly-say-job-not-done-on-inflation">Fed’s Kugler,
Daly say job not done on inflation</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Two Federal Reserve policymakers said Saturday they feel the U.S.
central bank’s job on taming inflation is not yet done, but also
signaled they do not want to risk damaging the labor market as they try
to finish that job. </p>
<p>The remarks, from Governor Adriana Kugler and San Francisco Fed
President Mary Daly, highlight the delicate balancing act facing U.S.
central bankers this year as they look to slow their pace of rate
cutting. The Fed lowered short-term rates by a full percentage point
last year, to a current range of 4.25%-4.50%. </p>
<p>Inflation by the Fed’s preferred measure is well down from its
mid-2022 peak of around 7%, registering 2.4% in November. Still, that’s
above the Fed’s 2% goal, and in December policymakers projected slower
progress toward that goal than they had earlier anticipated. </p>
<p>“We are fully aware that we are not there yet — no one is popping
champagne anywhere,” Kugler said at the annual American Economic
Association conference in San Francisco, California. “And at the same
time … we want the unemployment rate to stay where it is” and not
increase rapidly. </p>
<p>In November, unemployment was 4.2%, consistent in both her and
colleague Daly’s view with maximum employment, the Fed’s second goal
alongside its price stability goal. </p>
<p>“At this point, I would not want to see further slowing in the labor
market — maybe gradually moving around in bumps and chunks on a given
month, but certainly not additional slowing in the labor market,” said
Daly, who was speaking on the same panel. </p>
<p>The policymakers were not asked, nor did they volunteer their views,
about the potential impact of incoming President-elect Donald Trump’s
economic policies, including tariffs and tax cuts, which some have
speculated could fuel growth and reignite inflation.</p>

id="jill-biden-gets-priciest-gift-from-foreign-leader-in-2023-a-20000-diamond">Jill
Biden gets priciest gift from foreign leader in 2023 — a $20,000
diamond</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden and his family were given tens of
thousands of dollars in gifts from foreign leaders in 2023, according to
an annual accounting published by the State Department on Thursday, with
first lady Jill Biden receiving the single most expensive present: a
$20,000 diamond from India’s leader.</p>
<p>The 7.5-carat diamond from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was
easily the most costly gift presented to any member of the first family
in 2023, although she also received a brooch valued at $14,063 from the
Ukrainian ambassador to the United States and a bracelet, brooch and
photograph album worth $4,510 from the president and first lady of
Egypt.</p>
<p>The U.S. president himself received a number of expensive presents,
including a commemorative photo album valued at $7,100 from South
Korea’s recently impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol , a $3,495 statue of
Mongolian warriors from the Mongolian prime minister, a $3,300 silver
bowl from the sultan of Brunei, a $3,160 sterling silver tray from the
president of Israel, and a collage worth $2,400 from Ukrainian President
Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>
<p>Federal law requires executive branch officials to declare gifts they
receive from foreign leaders and counterparts that have an estimated
value of more than $480. Many of the gifts that meet that threshold are
relatively modest, and the more expensive ones are typically — but not
always — transferred to the National Archives or put on official
displays.</p>
<p>The $20,000 diamond was retained for official use in the White House
East Wing, according to a State Department document, while the other
gifts to the president and first lady were sent to the archives.</p>
<p>Vanessa Valdivia, a spokesperson for Jill Biden, said the diamond
will be turned over to the archives after they leave office. She did not
say what it was being used for.</p>
<p>Ukraine’s ambassador, Oksana Markarova, said Friday on Facebook that
a Ukrainian designer fashioned the brooch from the remains of a Russian
rocket and that the piece was made from inexpensive materials, so its
“true value … lies in its symbolism.” The embassy’s spokesperson, Halyna
Yusypiuk, said U.S. officials provided the assessed value.</p>
<p>Recipients have the option to purchase the gift from the U.S.
government at its market value, although that is rare, particularly with
high-end items.</p>
<p>According to the State Department’s Office of Protocol, which
compiles the list that will be published in Friday’s edition of the
Federal Register, several employees of the CIA reported receiving lavish
gifts of watches, perfume and jewelry, nearly all of which were
destroyed. Of the gifts destroyed, they were worth more than $132,000
combined.</p>
<p>CIA Director William Burns received a $18,000 astrograph, which is a
telescope and astrological camera, from a foreign source whose identity
is classified. That is being transferred to the General Services
Administration. But Burns reported receiving and destroying an $11,000
Omega watch, while numerous others did the same with luxury
timepieces.</p>
<p>Below the rank of director, the CIA employees who reported gifts are
not identified, but one of them logged an Omega Seamaster Aqua Terra
watch, a ladies Omega Constellation watch, a diamond necklace, earring
bracelet set, and a ring that were valued together at $65,100.</p>
<p>All of those were destroyed, according to the report, as was a
$30,000 women’s jewelry set from the Libyan jeweler Al Grew consisting
of a necklace, bracelet, ring and earrings received by another CIA
employee.</p>
<p>Another CIA employee reported receiving a men’s Yacht Master II Rolex
Oyster Perpetual watch worth $18,700, another reported getting a lady’s
Rolex Oyster Datejust watch valued at $12,500, and one other got a
$7,450 Rolex Air King watch. All three of the watches were destroyed,
according to the list.</p>
<p>Another employee reported receiving a collection of pricey Amouage
Perfume worth $10,670, the destruction of which is pending, the report
says.</p>

finds more records found linking Credit Suisse, Nazi accounts</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — An investigation by a U.S. Senate panel has found that
troubled investment bank Credit Suisse concealed information during
previous inquiries into Nazi-controlled bank accounts during World War
II.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of documents discovered during an ongoing
examination have provided new proof of the existence of account holders
linked to the Nazis, the Senate Budget Committee said in a statement
released Saturday.</p>
<p>The bank did not reveal the existence of these accounts during
previous investigations, notably in the 1990s, the committee said.</p>
<p>Credit Suisse, now a subsidiary of investment bank UBS, agreed in
1998 to take part in a $1.25 billion settlement of lawsuits brought by
Holocaust survivors, but it has been accused of not being completely
open about its past dealings with Nazis.</p>
<p>The Senate committee said Saturday that one set of newly discovered
files, including 3,600 physical documents and 40,000 microfilms, was
found to have a “high relevance rate” of Nazi connections.</p>
<p>It said the revelations stem from an interim report by former
prosecutor Neil Barofsky, who was fired as an “independent ombudsperson”
by the bank in 2022 after being pressed to limit his investigative
work.</p>
<p>Barofsky was reinstated in the role in 2023 “as a result of the
committee’s investigation,” and after UBS’s takeover of Credit
Suisse.</p>
<p>In a letter to the panel released Saturday, Barofsky noted the
“extraordinary level of cooperation that Credit Suisse, under the
leadership of UBS, has provided” since he rejoined the company.</p>
<p>But he said Credit Suisse had yet to share all the information it
held.</p>
<p>The Barofsky team has discovered, among other things, accounts
controlled by high-ranking SS officers, The Wall Street Journal
reported.</p>
<p>In his letter, Barofsky highlighted “especially noteworthy”
discoveries from a Credit Suisse research department.</p>
<p>“Numerous client files in the sample are marked with a stamp stating
‘Amerikanische schwarze Liste’ — meaning ‘American Black List’ — a list
maintained by the Allies of individuals and companies that were directly
financed by, or were known to regularly trade with, Axis powers,” he
wrote.</p>
<p>“One file bearing this stamp relates to an entity that was involved
in selling looted Jewish assets,” he added.</p>
<p>Contacted by AFP, UBS said it was committed to providing a complete
record of the former Nazi-linked accounts in Credit Suisse’s predecessor
banks.</p>
<p>It said it would provide Barofsky with all necessary assistance in
his work to shed light “on this tragic period.”</p>
<p>The Senate panel’s investigation is continuing.</p>

id="tesla-data-helped-police-after-truck-explosion-experts-have-privacy-concerns">Tesla
data helped police after truck explosion; experts have privacy
concerns</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Your car is spying on you. </p>
<p>That is one takeaway from the fast, detailed data that Tesla
collected on the driver of one of its Cybertrucks that exploded in Las
Vegas, Nevada, earlier this week. Privacy data experts say the deep dive
by Elon Musk’s company was impressive but also shines a spotlight on a
difficult question as vehicles become less like cars and more like
computers on wheels. </p>
<p>“You might want law enforcement to have the data to crack down on
criminals but can anyone have access to it?” said Jodi Daniels, CEO of
privacy consulting firm Red Clover Advisors.  </p>
<p>Many of the latest cars not only know where you’ve been and where you
are going, but also often have access to your contacts, your call logs,
your texts and other sensitive information thanks to cell phone
syncing. </p>
<p>The data collected by Musk’s electric car company after the
Cybertruck packed with fireworks burst into flames in front of the Trump
International Hotel Wednesday proved valuable to police in helping track
the driver’s movements. </p>
<p>Within hours of the New Year’s Day explosion that burned the driver
beyond recognition and injured seven, Tesla was able to track Matthew
Livelsberger’s movements in detail from Denver to Las Vegas — and
confirm that the problem was explosives in the truck, not the truck
itself. Tesla used data collected from charging stations and from
onboard software. </p>
<p>“I have to thank Elon Musk, specifically,” said Las Vegas
Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Kevin McMahill to reporters.
 </p>
<p>Some privacy experts were less enthusiastic. </p>
<p>“It reveals the kind of sweeping surveillance going on,” said David
Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute
at Northeastern University in Boston. “When something bad happens, it’s
helpful, but it’s a double-edged sword. Companies that collect this data
can abuse it.” </p>
<p>General Motors, for instance, was sued in August by the Texas
attorney general for allegedly selling data from 1.8 million drivers to
insurance companies without their consent. </p>
<p>Cars equipped with cameras to enable self-driving features have added
a new security risk. Tesla itself came under fire after Reuters reported
how employees from 2019 through 2022 shared drivers’ sensitive videos
and recordings with each other, including videos of road rage incidents
and, in one case, nudity. </p>
<p>Tesla did not respond to emailed questions about its privacy policy.
On its website, Tesla says it follows strict rules for keeping names and
information private. </p>
<p>“No one but you would have knowledge of your activities, location, or
a history of where you’ve been,” according to a statement. “Your
information is kept private and secure.” </p>
<p>Auto analyst Sam Abuelsamid at Telemetry Insight, said he doesn’t
think Tesla is “especially worse” than other auto companies in handling
customer data, but he is still concerned. </p>
<p>“This is one of the biggest ethical issues we have around modern
vehicles. They’re connected,” he said. “Consumers need to have control
over their data.” </p>
<p>Tensions were high when the Cybertruck parked at the front doors of
Trump’s hotel began smoking, then burst into flames. Just hours earlier,
a driver in another vehicle using the same peer-to-peer car rental
service, Turo, had killed 15 people after slamming into a crowd in New
Orleans, Louisiana, in what law enforcement is calling a terrorist
attack. </p>
<p>Shortly before 1 p.m., the Las Vegas police announced they were
investigating a second incident. </p>
<p>“The whole Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now,”
Musk wrote on X. “Will post more information as soon as we learn
anything.” </p>
<p>Over the next few hours, Tesla was able to piece together
Livelsberger’s journey over five days and four states by tracking, among
other things, his recharging stops in various locations, including
Monument, Colorado, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Flagstaff, Arizona.</p>

<h2 id="drivers-skid-crash-as-winter-storm-grips-central-us">Drivers
skid, crash as winter storm grips central US</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MISSION, KANSAS — Road conditions were deteriorating Saturday in the
central U.S. as a winter storm brought a mix of snow, ice and plunging
temperatures, with forecasts calling for the dreaded combo to spread
eastward in the coming days.</p>
<p>“Winter returned,” said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster at the National
Weather Service in College Park, Maryland.</p>
<p>The polar vortex of ultra-cold air usually stays penned up around the
North Pole, spinning like a top. But sometimes it escapes or stretches
down to the U.S., Europe or Asia — and that’s when large numbers of
people experience intense doses of cold.</p>
<p>Studies show a fast-warming Arctic gets some of the blame for the
increase in polar vortex stretching or wandering.</p>
<p>Snow and ice in forecast</p>
<p>By Saturday evening, widespread heavy snow was likely between central
Kansas and Indiana, especially along and north of Interstate 70, where
there was a high chance of at least 20 centimeters of snow. Part of the
interstate was closed in central Kansas by the afternoon.</p>
<p>The storm was forecast to move then into the Ohio Valley, with severe
travel disruptions expected. It will reach the Mid-Atlantic states
Sunday into Monday, with a hard freeze expected as far south as
Florida.</p>
<p>Severe thunderstorms, with the possibility of tornadoes and hail,
were also possible ahead of the storm system’s cold front as it crosses
the Lower Mississippi Valley, the National Weather Service warned.</p>
<p>Car wrecks</p>
<p>A fire truck, several tractor-trailers and passenger vehicles
overturned west of Salina, Kansas. Rigs also jackknifed and went into
ditches, state Highway Patrol Trooper Ben Gardner said.</p>
<p>He posted a video showing his boots sliding across the highway
blacktop like an ice-skating rink.</p>
<p>“We are in it now,” Gardner said as he drove to the scene of an
accident. Online, he begged for prayers and warned that some roadways
were nearly impassable.</p>
<p>Freezing rain in Wichita, Kansas, sent authorities to multiple
crashes in the morning, and police urged drivers to stay home if
possible and watch out for emergency vehicles.</p>
<p>Governors in neighboring Missouri and nearby Arkansas declared states
of emergency. Whiteout conditions threatened to make driving dangerous
to impossible and heighten the risk of becoming stranded, forecasters
warned.</p>
<p>Getting ready</p>
<p>Stores in Wichita were filled with shoppers stocking up on groceries
in advance of the storm, and warming centers opened in churches and
libraries.</p>
<p>Several businesses closed across the Kansas City area, and the school
district in suburban Independence, Missouri, said it might need to
cancel classes for one or more days.</p>
<p>“Get where you’re going now &amp; stay put. If you must travel,
consider packing a bag &amp; staying where you’re headed,” the Missouri
Department of Transportation said in a message on the social platform
X.</p>
<p>The agency warned Friday that a shortage of workers could hamper the
ability to clear roads.</p>
<p>In Columbus, Ohio, crews treated major roadways with anti-icing
liquids.</p>
<p>“It will be a major headache,” said Tom Kines, a senior meteorologist
with AccuWeather. “The storm not only has the snow threat to it but the
ice threat.”</p>
<p>Power outages could be significant particularly south of the Kansas
City area, Kines said.</p>
<p>Temperatures dip</p>
<p>Starting Monday, the eastern two-thirds of the country will
experience dangerous, bone-chilling cold and wind chills, forecasters
said. Temperatures could be 7 to 14 degrees Celsius below normal as the
polar vortex stretches down from the high Arctic.</p>
<p>In Chicago on Saturday, temperatures hovered near minus 7-10 Celsius
and around minus 18 C in Minneapolis, while dropping to minus 25 C at
International Falls, Minnesota, on the Canadian border.</p>
<p>Disruptions extend southward</p>
<p>Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency Friday
evening ahead of the storm and noted it could impact people’s ability to
vote in the state’s special elections Tuesday. In a statement on X, he
encouraged residents to vote Saturday before the bad weather
arrives.</p>
<p>A similar declaration was issued in Maryland, where officials in the
historic state capital near Chesapeake Bay asked residents to remove
vehicles from emergency snow routes. Annapolis also announced plans to
open several garages on Sunday for free parking.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service predicted about 20 to 30 centimeters of
snow for the Annapolis area, with temperatures remaining below freezing
throughout the weekend.</p>
<p>In Baltimore, an extreme weather alert was issued instructing
agencies to provide shelter and assistance for those in need. City
officials said wind chills were expected to dip to minus 10.56 degrees
Celsius overnight Saturday and remain in the teens through Tuesday.</p>

<h2 id="blinken-heads-to-south-korea-japan-france">Blinken heads to
South Korea, Japan, France</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Antony Blinken will embark on what is
expected to be his final overseas trip in office this weekend, traveling
to South Korea, Japan and France. </p>
<p>The State Department announced Friday that Blinken would visit Seoul,
South Korean, Tokyo and Paris beginning Sunday. </p>
<p>In South Korea, which is in the midst of political turmoil following
the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol, and Japan, Blinken intends
to highlight the expansion of U.S. cooperation with both nations as part
of the Biden administration’s Indo-Pacific strategy. </p>
<p>That strategy is primarily intended to blunt Chinese ambitions in the
region but also to deter the nuclear threat from North Korea. Political
developments in South Korea, however, after Yoon declared martial law
and was later impeached, have raised questions about the stability of
Washington-Seoul relations. </p>
<p>The U.S. has taken a cautious approach to the uncertainty, insisting
that the U.S.-South Korea alliance remains intact and iron-clad. Blinken
will speak with South Korean officials about how “to build on our
critical cooperation on challenges around the world based on our shared
values,” the State Department said in a statement. </p>
<p>In Tokyo, Blinken will “review the tremendous progress the U.S.-Japan
alliance has made over the past few years,” the statement said. That
includes a major arms sales approval announced on Friday under which the
U.S. will deliver some $3.64 billion in medium-range missiles, related
equipment and training to Japan. </p>
<p>China has repeatedly complained about the potential sale, saying it
will affect stability and security in the region, allegations that both
Japan and the U.S. reject. </p>
<p>Blinken will wrap up his trip in Paris in meetings with French
officials to discuss developments in the Middle East and European
security, particularly in Ukraine.</p>

id="exiled-venezuelan-opposition-leader-to-visit-us-speak-with-biden">Exiled
Venezuelan opposition leader to visit US, speak with Biden</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA — Venezuelan opposition politician Edmundo
Gonzalez Urrutia, who fled the country after a tumultuous election and
subsequent police crackdown, said Saturday he plans to speak with U.S.
President Joe Biden. </p>
<p>Speaking in Argentina, where he met with President Javier Milei,
Gonzalez added that he was traveling to the United States on Sunday,
though it was unclear when the conversation with Biden would take
place. </p>
<p>“We are planning a conversation with President Biden, and we are
waiting for definitions regarding the new authorities,” Gonzalez said in
the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, referring to incoming
President-elect Donald Trump, who is set to take over on January
20. </p>
<p>Gonzalez’s meeting with Milei came at the start of a regional tour
aimed at building international support for the man Venezuela’s
opposition considers the rightful president-elect. </p>
<p>The 75-year-old appeared alongside Milei on a balcony of the Casa
Rosada, the Argentine president’s official workplace, as hundreds of
Venezuelans gathered below on the Plaza de Mayo chanted “Venezuela, you
are not alone!” </p>
<p>The appearance came just days before Gonzalez’s rival, Nicolas
Maduro, is set to be sworn in for a third presidential term in
Caracas. </p>
<p>The United States, the European Union and dozens of other countries
say Venezuelan election officials manipulated the vote results, which
they have yet to publish in detail, of the July 28 elections.  </p>
<p>Some countries instead have recognized Gonzalez as the  winner. </p>
<p>Gonzalez arrived in Buenos Aires quietly from Madrid, where he has
lived in exile since fleeing Venezuela in September. Authorities in
Caracas have offered a reward of $100,000 for information leading to his
capture. </p>
<p>Street protests erupted after the election and degenerated into
clashes with police, with 28 people dead, 200 injured and more than
2,400 arrested. </p>
<p>Gonzalez’s schedule calls for him to visit Uruguay late Saturday,
Panama on Wednesday and the Dominican Republic the day after. </p>
<p>He has said he will be in Caracas on January 10 to be sworn in as
president. It remains unclear how the Maduro government will
respond. </p>
<p>Gonzalez’s visit to Argentina came amid heightened bilateral tensions
following the arrest in Venezuela of an Argentine policeman on what
Buenos Aires says are trumped up charges of terrorism. </p>
<p>The relationship was already strained following an exchange of
insults and, ultimately, Argentina’s refusal to recognize Maduro’s
victory claim. </p>
<p>The Argentine Embassy in Caracas has also been sheltering six
opposition figures accused of “terrorism,” a matter Gonzalez had said he
would take up with Milei.</p>
