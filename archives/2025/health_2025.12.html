and validation of an automated and high-throughput quadruplex RT–ddPCR
assay for the detection of influenza A, influenza B, respiratory
syncytial virus, and SARS-CoV-2</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-28, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>The main detection method for viral respiratory infections is reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR), but it is susceptible
to sample inhibitors and relies on a standard curve and subjective
thresholds to quantify nucleic acid targets. However, droplet digital
PCR (ddPCR), the third generation of PCR with higher sensitivity and
accuracy, is an effective tool for the detection and absolute
quantification of respiratory viruses. In this study, we introduced
AHQR–ddPCR, which is an automated and high-throughput quadruplex reverse
transcription ddPCR assay based on the QX ONE platform for the detection
of influenza A, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, and SARS-CoV-2
in a single reaction. The AHQR–ddPCR assay had analytical sensitivity as
low as 0.65–0.78 copies/μL for four respiratory viruses, and exhibited
excellent analytical specificity, intraassay and interassay precision,
and a wide linear range for each viral target. The results in clinical
samples showed that the assay had good concordance and better diagnostic
sensitivity compared to RT-PCR. In short, the highly sensitive and
absolutely quantitative AHQR–ddPCR assay has excellent analytical and
clinical performance, and the advantage of detecting weakly positive
samples, which can effectively reduce false-negative results and is a
powerful complement to RT–PCR. In addition, it has great value for
virology research and the development of automated molecular assays.</p>

assessment of gut microbiota in circadian rhythm disorders: a
cross-sectional clinical study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe interaction between the host and microbiota is
influenced by host circadian rhythm. However, it is unknown what the
changes of gut microbiota and metabolites.MethodsWe conducted a
cross-sectional study (n=72) in which participants’ fecal DNA was
detected by macrogenomic sequencing analysis. The feces, urine and blood
were analyzed by widely targeted metabolomics analysis.ResultsPearson
correlation analysis showed that most of the clinical symptoms of people
with circadian rhythm disorders were moderately positively correlated
with gastrointestinal symptoms. By distilling the results of multinomic
analysis, we reported a variety of different species (19 species in the
gut) and metabolites. In our results, the correlation of multiomics is
mostly concentrated in Lachnospiraceae bacterium and Streptococcus mitis
oralis pneumoniae. Bile acid-related metabolites are the most
significant metabolites associated with these species.DiscussionOur
study demonstrates the severity of clinical manifestations caused by
circadian rhythm disorder is closely related to microbiota and
metabolism. In the future, personalized interventions targeting specific
microbial species or metabolites may help alleviate the physical and
psychological discomfort induced by circadian rhythm disturbances.</p>

infection is an important factor associated with pin loosening during
external fixation: a prospective analysis of 47 consecutive
patients</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-27, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe occurrence of pin loosening represents a common issue
in the context of external fixation methodologies; nevertheless, a
comprehensive investigation into the multifaceted causes of pin
loosening, incorporating a multivariate analysis among pin infection,
bone quality, and pin insertion angle, is notably absent in current
literature. The present study endeavors to pinpoint factors associated
with pin loosening through such a multivariate analysis.MethodologyThe
study encompassed patients who underwent the removal of external
fixators from March 2023 to July 2023. The assessment of pin loosening
was executed through the utilization of the pin track score, the pin
removal torque value (PRTV), and the radiolucent zone around the pin
(RZAP) as depicted in digital radiography (DR) images. Culturing of the
pin-bone interfaces was performed, and measurements of the grayscale
intensity of cortical bone (GSCB) and pin verticality within DR images
were taken. Multivariate analyses were conducted employing a Generalized
Linear Mixed-Effects Model (GLMM), Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by exponentiating the model
coefficients (Exp(β)).ResultsAltogether 47 patients with a total of 220
pins were included for analysis. The mean PRTV was 1.9 ± 2.1 N·m. The
correlation analysis between PRTV and RZAP yielded a P-value of less
than 0.001, signifying a substantial correlation between pin loosening
and RZAP. For pins with a PRTV of 0, the RZAP measured 1.9 ± 0.8 mm. The
positive rate of bacterial culture was 20%, and the loosening rate was
26.8%. Pin loosening was significantly associated with bacterial
infection (aOR = 2.24, 95% CI: 1.03-4.90, P = 0.04) and GSCB (aOR =
0.50, 95% CI: 0.38-0.66, P &lt; 0.01), but not with pin verticality (aOR
= 1.00, 95% CI: 0.93-1.08, P = 0.99). Non-HA-coated pins remained
significantly associated with bacterial infection (aOR = 8.20, 95% CI:
2.18-30.85, P = 0.002), whereas HA-coated pins were not (aOR = 3.44, 95%
CI: 0.24-48.76, P = 0.36).ConclusionsPin loosening was significantly
associated with bacterial infection at the pin-bone interface and lower
GSCB, but not with pin verticality. Notably, infection strongly
predicted loosening in non-HA-coated pins, while HA-coated pins
demonstrated higher raw infection rates.</p>

of the gut microbiota and endocannabinoidome: a molecular and functional
perspective</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>This review examines the impact of interactions between the gut
microbiota and the endocannabinoidome (eCBome) on health and disease,
highlighting their significance for physiological and pathological
processes. We identify key research gaps and challenges to advance the
field. The review discusses the role of dietary patterns and physical
activity in regulating these interactions. It also explores the complex
nature of these interactions in conditions such as inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD), depression, anxiety, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and
metabolic disorders. This analysis evaluates their contributions to
disease onset and progression, and examines the molecular mechanisms and
signaling pathways involved. From this, we provide forward-looking
perspectives on future research directions, advocating for a more
nuanced understanding of the gut microbiota–eCBome axis. We anticipate
that future research will integrate gut microbiota–endocannabinoidome
interactions into therapeutic strategies for a broad range of
diseases.</p>

id="tick-borne-encephalitis-virus-subtypes-mono--and-mixed-infection-in-specific-and-non-specific-ticks">Tick-borne
encephalitis virus subtypes: mono- and mixed infection in specific and
non-specific ticks</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is traditionally divided into
three main subtypes – European (Eu), Siberian (Sib) and Far Eastern
(FE), the distribution of which is confined to the areas of the main
vectors, Ixodes ricinus (TBEV-Eu) and Ixodes persulcatus (TBEV-Sib,
TBEV-FE). Dermacentor reticulatus also can act as competent vector and
participate in TBEV circulation together with the main vectors. It is
suggested that there is a specific adaptation not only between TBEV
variant and certain tick species, but also between virus variant and
local populations of one tick species. In our study, we percoxally
infected two populations of I. ricinus, I. persulcatus and D.
reticulatus collected in remote areas with three TBEV strains of the
main subtypes. Dynamics of the number of TBEV RNA copies and of the
number of infectious for mammalian cells virus particles during mono-
and mixed infection of ticks were estimated by real-time PCR and plaque
assay in PEK cell culture, respectively. Data was obtained that I.
ricinus, I. persulcatus and D. reticulatus effectively support the
reproduction of TBEV regardless of the strain. Interpopulation
differences of local populations of one tick species in the maintenance
of TBEV reproduction were revealed in I. persulcatus during mono- and
mixed infection and in I. ricinus during mixed infection. Despite minor
differences in the level of virus reproduction in ticks, we observed
changes in the infectivity of TBEV strains for mammalian cell culture
during persistence in different species of ticks. Notably, the TBEV-Eu
increased infectivity during adaptation to a non-specific tick species.
Thus, we demonstrated that the level of virus reproduction is not the
primary factor that determines the adaptation of TBEV to a new tick
species. The nature of changes in TBEV infectivity depends on the virus
strain and the species of ticks.</p>

Klebsiella pneumoniae infections in Chinese children: in vitro
activities of ceftazidime-avibactam and aztreonam-avibactam against
carbapenemase-producing strains in a two-center study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>ObjectiveThis study assessed epidemiology characteristics,
carbapenem-resistance genes, and drug resistance to
ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA) and aztreonam-avibactam (AZA) in children
with carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella Pneumoniae (CRKP)
infections.MethodsA total of 363 non-repetitive CRKP strains were
collected from children who underwent two tertiary children’s hospital
between 1 January 2021 and 30 June 2024 in Chongqing and Kunming in
Southwest China. Carbapenem resistance genes and antimicrobial
susceptibility were analyzed. Basic clinical characteristics of the
patients were obtained from medical records.ResultsblaNDM-5, blaNDM-1,
and blaKPC-2 were the predominant carbapenemase genes; their detection
rates were 35.8%, 30.3%, and 25.3%, respectively. Patients in the
KPC-2-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-KP) (median age, 90 days)
were older than those producing NDM-1 and NDM-5 Klebsiella pneumoniae
(NDM-KP) (median age, 37 days) (P &lt; 0.05). The detection rate of
NDM-KP in the neonatal unit was higher compared with KPC-KP (62.5%
vs. 9.8%, P &lt; 0.05), while the detection rate of NDM-KP in the
intensive care unit (ICU) was decreased compared with KPC-KP (9.6%
vs. 40.2%, P &lt; 0.05). NDM-KP had lower resistance rates to
aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones than KPC-KP; the resistance rate of
aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones among NDM-KP and KPC-KP in
Chongqing was increased compared with Kunming. The sensitivity rates of
KPC-KP to CZA and NDM-KP to AZA were 100%, and the MIC50 of the CRKP to
CZA and AZA were 2 μg/mL and 0.125μg/mL, respectively.ConclusionsThe
epidemiological characteristics of Chinese children with CRKP
infections, including the resistance genes and the antibiotic resistance
of CRKP, exhibited significant variation between the two regions.KPC-KP
strains had higher antimicrobial resistance in patients and thus should
be given more attention in clinics and infection control.</p>

models as a tool to study asymptomatic DENV infections</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Asymptomatic outcome accounts for most dengue virus infections and is
likely to play an important role in maintaining virus circulation,
contributing to its dissemination and shortening inter-epidemic periods.
While dengue immunopathogenesis, investigation of potential
therapeutics, and vaccine efficacy have been widely studied, only
recently have inapparent infections begun to be comprehensively
addressed as an integral and important part of the puzzle that is dengue
infection. Animal models are one of the tools utilized to study dengue
and, among these, mouse models have played an important role in
understanding both dengue pathogenesis and the hosts’ initial immune
response. However, these models have mostly focused on untangling the
drivers of disease severity ignoring asymptomatic dengue virus
infections. In this mini-review, the authors propose to provide a
concise overview of the current state-of-the-art of existing mouse
models with potential use for studying asymptomatic dengue virus
infections, elaborating on the pros and cons of the several models.
Variations in experimental conditions, such as altering the viral load
of the inoculum or employing different virus entry routes, especially in
mice with partial or transient blockade of the type I interferon
response, might be sufficient to obtain both symptomatic and
asymptomatic viremic mice. This would enable the study of factors
involved in asymptomatic dengue virus infections.</p>

id="hpv-and-co-infections-impacts-on-semen-inflammation-oxidative-stress-and-sperm-quality">HPV
and co-infections: impacts on semen inflammation, oxidative stress, and
sperm quality</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-26, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionHuman papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually
transmitted viral infection worldwide, which has been suggested to
induce male urogenital inflammation and affect fertility. However,
reported evidence is scarce and inconclusive. Moreover, the putative
effects of coinfections remain largely unexplored. This study aimed to
analyze HPV male urogenital infection, both as a single infection and in
conjunction with other common uropathogens, along with its impact on
inflammatory biomarkers in semen, oxidative stress and sperm
quality.MethodsThe prevalence of HPV urogenital infection and its
coinfection with several other uropathogens was analyzed in a cohort of
205 men attending a urology clinic. Furthermore, levels of sperm
leukocyte subsets and inflammatory cytokines, semen analysis, sperm
apoptosis and necrosis, and sperm ROS production were assessed.ResultsA
considerable prevalence (19%) of HPV male urogenital infection was
found. Interestingly, HPV was detected coinfecting with at least one
other uropathogen in most cases (74.4%). Notably, the most frequently
detected coinfection was C. trachomatis (CT, 52% of cases). Remarkably,
patients solely infected with HPV showed no significant alterations in
conventional sperm quality parameters as well as reduced concentrations
of IL-6 and leukocytes in semen. However, patients coinfected with HPV
and CT showed significantly impaired sperm concentration and motility
and increased levels of IL-6 in semen.ConclusionThese results indicate
that HPV infection alone does not associate with semen inflammation or
major changes in sperm quality. However, co-infection with CT is
associated with both semen inflammation and reduced sperm quality. This
indicates that, besides being prevalent, concurrent HPV and CT
infections in semen may represent a unique clinical entity with
particular characteristics.</p>

and genetic mutations of pyrethroid resistance in Aedes albopictus in
the context of urbanization: a case study of Hangzhou, China</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) serves as a
globally significant vector for arboviruses such as dengue, chikungunya,
and Zika. The extensive application of pyrethroid insecticides has led
to a growing resistance in Ae. albopictus populations, thereby
compromising mosquito control initiatives. This study examines the
mechanisms underlying pyrethroid resistance and the related genetic
mutations in Ae. albopictus within the framework of urbanization, with
the objective of informing the development of effective control
strategies.MethodsAe. albopictus larvae were sampled from five districts
in Hangzhou, China, each characterized by different levels of
urbanization. Resistance to beta-cypermethrin and permethrin were
evaluated utilizing the World Health Organization (WHO) tube test
methodology. Molecular analyses were conducted to identify mutations in
the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene, with a specific focus on
the F1534S mutation. The data were subjected to statistical analysis
using Fisher’s exact test, chi-square test, and Pearson correlation to
assess the relationship between resistance levels and
urbanization.ResultsPopulations of Ae. albopictus in Hangzhou
demonstrated substantial resistance to pyrethroids, with mortality rates
falling below 90%. Notably, the Binjiang District exhibited the lowest
mortality rates, with 20.55% for beta-cypermethrin and 21.21% for
permethrin, whereas Chun’an County displayed relatively higher mortality
rates of 32.00% and 47.28%, respectively. The F1534S mutation was
predominantly observed, with homozygous (S/S) mutations constituting
87.78% and 83.29% of the populations exposed to beta-cypermethrin and
permethrin, respectively. Chi-square analyses confirmed a significant
association between the F1534S mutation and resistance (P &lt; 0.01).
Furthermore, no significant correlation was identified between
resistance levels and urbanization rates (P &gt; 0.05), indicating that
urbanization is not a primary factor contributing to
resistance.ConclusionThe F1534S mutation is pivotal in conferring
pyrethroid resistance in Ae. albopictus. To enhance the effectiveness of
mosquito control strategies, it is imperative to incorporate resistance
monitoring, insecticide rotation, and non-chemical approaches.
Additionally, further research is warranted to investigate alternative
resistance mechanisms and the influence of urbanization on mosquito
ecology.</p>

gallate and its analogues interact with sortase A and β-lactamase to
suppress Staphylococcus aureus virulence</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-25, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Staphylococcus aureus sortase A can anchor virulence proteins, which
are responsible for bacterial adhesion, biofilm formation, and
inflammation, to the cell membrane surface. The ability of β-lactam
antibiotics to combat S. aureus infections is limited by the presence of
β-lactamases in this pathogen. In this study, we determined that
epicatechin gallate (ECG) and its analogues inhibited the transpeptidase
activity of sortase A by interacting with it directly, and the biofilm
formation and adhesion abilities of the bacterium decreased after
treatment with ECG and its analogues. Additionally, ECG bound to
β-lactamase and reduced its ability to hydrolyze nitrocefin.
Furthermore, ECG synergized with ampicillin (Amp), enhancing its
bactericidal effects and inhibiting the formation of persisters. ECG did
not affect the expression of sortase A or β-lactamase but significantly
alleviated the cytotoxicity of S. aureus USA300. ECG alone or combined
with Amp in vivo improved the survival of mice infected with S. aureus
USA300, alleviated pathological tissue damage and pulmonary edema, and
reduced the extent of inflammation and level of colonization. The
results of this study indicate that the active ingredients of green tea,
especially ECG, have the potential to be developed as anti-S. aureus
infection agents.</p>

the relationship between cycle threshold of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, clinical
features, and laboratory data in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in
Semnan, Iran</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionCOVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has emerged as
a global public health crisis. Understanding the factors associated with
disease severity and outcomes is crucial for effective patient
management. This study aimed to investigate the association between
cycle threshold (CT) values, demographic data, medical history, clinical
manifestations, and laboratory findings in hospitalized COVID-19
patients in Semnan, Iran.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted on
86 patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to two hospitals in Semnan,
Iran, between December 2022 and March 2023. Respiratory swab samples
were collected RT-PCR was performed, CT values were obtained, and data
were collected from medical records, including demographic information,
medical history, clinical manifestations, and laboratory results.
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software.ResultsThe study
included 86 COVID-19 patients, with a slightly higher representation of
females (55.8%) and a mean age of 67.43 years. Pre-existing conditions
like hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and ischemic heart disease were
prevalent among hospitalized patients. A majority of patients (59.3%)
had severe COVID-19, as indicated by lower CT values, while 31.4%
exhibited oxygen saturation levels below 90%. Significant differences
were observed in FBS, CRP, WBC, Hb, Cr, and SPo2 levels between severe
and non-severe patients. Correlation analysis revealed associations
between age, CRP, Cr, BUN, FBS, Vitamin D, TG, LDL, HDL, AST, ALP, and
SPo2. Reflecting complex interactions between inflammatory markers,
organ function, and lipid metabolism in COVID-19 patients.ConclusionThis
study provides valuable insights into the association between CT values,
clinical characteristics, and laboratory findings in hospitalized
COVID-19 patients. The findings underscore the importance of CT values
in assessing disease severity and potential prognostication. Further
research is warranted to validate these findings in larger and more
diverse patient populations.</p>

microbiome differences and disease risk in colorectal cancer relatives
and healthy individuals</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Given the heightened focus on high-risk populations, this study aimed
to provide insights into early susceptibility and preventive strategies
for colorectal cancer (CRC) by focusing on high-risk populations. In
this research, fecal samples from 1,647 individuals across three
discovery cohorts and nine external validation cohorts were sequenced
using whole-genome metagenomic sequencing. A prediction model based on
random forest was constructed using the nine external cohorts and
independently validated with the three discovery cohorts. A disease
probability (POD) model based on microbial biomarkers was developed to
assess CRC risk. We found that the gut microbiome composition of CRC
relatives differed from that of controls, with enrichment of species
such as Fusobacterium and Bacteroides and a reduction in beneficial
genera like Coprococcus and Roseburia. Additionally, dietary red meat
intake emerged as a risk factor. The POD model indicated an elevated
risk of CRC in unaffected relatives. The findings suggest that the POD
for CRC may be increased in unaffected relatives or individuals living
in shared environments, although this difference did not reach
statistical significance. Our study introduces a novel framework for
assessing the risk of colorectal cancer in ostensibly healthy
individuals.</p>

affecting dysbiosis of the gut microbiota in the elderly and the
progress of interventions in traditional Chinese and Western
medicine</h2>
<p>date: 2025-03-24, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>As the population ages, intestinal health in the elderly has become a
key area of concern, with gut microbiota dysbiosis emerging as a
significant issue. This review summarizes the factors influencing
dysbiosis and interventions from both traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)
and Western medicine, offering a reference for future research. A
comprehensive search of global databases up to March 2024 identified 617
original studies on gut microbiota dysbiosis in individuals aged 65 and
older. After applying strict PRISMA guidelines, 20 articles met the
inclusion criteria. Key findings are summarized in four areas: 1) the
definition and mechanisms of dysbiosis, 2) evaluation tools for gut
microbiota imbalance, 3) factors contributing to dysbiosis in the
elderly, and 4) pharmacological treatments. Both TCM and Western
medicine offer unique advantages in managing gut microbiota dysbiosis,
and the choice of intervention should be tailored to the individual’s
condition. Future research should focus on optimizing integrated TCM and
Western medicine approaches to improve outcomes for elderly patients
with gut microbiota dysbiosis.</p>
