<h2 id="the-economy-he-died-five-years-ago.">The Economy? He died five
years ago.</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-01, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
I hold a conspiracy theory
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Rb3Wh6YDeAU">the global economy
died five years ago during Covid</a>. It’s been on life support through
stimulus checks and flash tech hype cycles ever since trying to keep the
dormant heart beating. You sense it too. There’s no beating heart.
There’s no thumping energy. No vein of excitement. Tech and knowledge
work seems to be suffering the most.
</p>
<p>
The death of the Economy started long before Covid if I’m honest. Since
the iPhone it feels like everyone has been waiting for the next big hit,
the next new shiny, the next money-maker. It’s like an endless
distracted boyfriend meme looping year over year. And I regret to inform
you that the investors are at it again. Today it’s LLMs, before that
crypto and the Web3 Metaverse, before that VR, before that the gig
economy, before that smartwatches, before that smart-homes, before that
3D televisions, before that…
</p>
<p>
The phalanx of tech billionaires behind Trump at the inauguration is an
image seared into my memory and it’s taught me a lot. It taught me that
these companies are desperate. Desperate to win favor. Desperate to
avoid regulation. Desperate to keep their government contracts. Because
without the preferential treatment, the lawlessness, and the humongous
contracts, they’re financially and morally bankrupt.
</p>
<p>
(To be fair –why do I feel the need to be fair to tech billionaires!?–
from a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedman_doctrine">Friedman
doctrine</a> perspective their job is to create value for stakeholders.
Kissing the ring of the petty, easily-aggrieved, fascist, man-baby
tyrant is probably the most surefire way to avoid unwanted scrutiny in
uncertain fiscal times. I understand that part of their job. But I’d
wager the long-term outcome will be that they set themselves up for
future embarrassment, exploitation, and extortion while simultaneously
selling out all the immigrants, queer people, and furries who keep their
empires running on a daily basis.)
</p>
<p>
That scene in the rotunda reinforced my belief the economy was already
dead. If Big Tech is clinging to government contracts and quid pro quo
perks, then we must be out of ideas. Every time the winds of fortune
change, everyone points their boats in the same direction. In a healthy,
living economy shouldn’t there be more than one lake to fish in? Instead
of asking “What doesn’t exist and would be useful?” and investing in
that, it’s about “How can I extract the most money from hot new tech?”
Instead of “What’s quality?” and chasing that, it’s “How can we move
fast and make breakable things?”
</p>
<p>
An aside: What if there are no new ideas? What if the internet
accelerated knowledge sharing to the point we’ve made all the software
and we’re literally out of ideas!? There are no more worlds left to
conquer, Alexander! Help!
</p>
<p>
I doubt that though. I bet there’s good ideas out there. I bet they’re
not on Mars. I bet they’re inside people you already know. Impractical
ideas that don’t scale well to billions of users but could have an
incredible impact on a local economy and community (RIP Gowalla). Ideas
that solve actual problems and create actual utility or connection.
Small-scale ideas that when combined can breathe new life into a dead
economy.
</p>
<p>
The definition of a healthy economy is actually one problem I had with
the Biden administration. Liberals do a terrible job communicating
economic accomplishments even though they outperform Conservative
administrations by a large margin. When they do communicate it’s always
in lagging indicators like GDP, the stock market, non-farm jobs,
consumer price indexes, or low-unemployment numbers. Those are all well
and good, but to me it all comes down to a single question: If I lost or
quit my job today how easy would it be to find another similar job? To
me economic mobility is the true sign of a healthy economy, the ability
to have options. To be free.
</p>
<p>
I’m trying to stay optimistic, but the realist in me knows it’ll be some
time until the economy comes back again. At a minimum, we’ll have to
restart investments in science. Especially weird science. Even more
weird than what you’re thinking right now. I’m talking super weird. And
then that weird science takes 20 years to become practical applications.
Through that public good is how we get the foundations like the
Internet, WiFi, and GPS that have built the society we know and are
dependent on today. It’s how we build the pipeline for tomorrow’s
economy. But those innovations are on a decades timescale and
–math-wise– I’m not sure I have that in me.

on People Through Airportr Luggage Delivery Service</h2>
<p>date: 2025-08-01, updated: 2025-07-30, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Airportr is a service that allows passengers to have their luggage
picked up, checked, and delivered to their destinations. As you might
expect, it’s used by wealthy or important people. So if the company’s
website is
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/luggage-service-web-bugs-exposed-travel-plans-users-diplomats-airportr/">insecure</a>,
you’d be able to spy on lots of wealthy or important people. And maybe
even steal their luggage.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Researchers at the firm CyberX9 found that simple bugs in Airportr’s
website allowed them to access virtually all of those users’ personal
information, including travel plans, or even gain administrator
privileges that would have allowed a hacker to redirect or steal luggage
in transit. Among even the small sample of user data that the
researchers reviewed and shared with WIRED they found what appear to be
the personal information and travel records of multiple government
officials and diplomats from the UK, Switzerland, and the US…

<p>An hour after I posted my piece about Meta’s Super Intelligence memo,
a friend pinged me and pointed out that once again, Mark Zuckerberg has
subsumed someone’s idea and phrase and presented it as his own: personal
super intelligence. Not surprising, given that “copy” and “subsume” are
on-brand for Zuck, who historically has not been shy …</p>

<h2 id="easy-sci-fi-rectangles-with-corner-shape">Easy sci-fi rectangles
with corner-shape</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-31, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
In Chromium 139, CSS gets a new <code>corner-shape</code> property which
unlocks some cool new CSS tricks. Most notably it gives us “squircles”,
the mathematical superellipse shape introduced by Apple in iOS 7.
Designers have been in love with them ever since and include them in
every design comp using Figma’s “corner-smoothing” slider even tho CSS
has no similar correlation… until now!
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://frontendmasters.com/blog/understanding-css-corner-shape-and-the-power-of-the-superellipse/">Frontend
Masters has a beautiful writeup on <code>corner-shape</code> and
superellipses</a> showing that it goes way beyond squircles to make some
real complex shapes. One capability they didn’t cover in that post is
probably the most important of all: CSS <code>corner-shape</code>
enables easy sci-fi rectangles.
</p>
<p>
By “sci-fi rectangles” I am of course referring to the sci-fi film and
television trope where all rectangles (doors, windows, furniture,
user-interfaces) have one to three angular corners instead of all
corners being the old, boring, un-futuristic 90º rectangle corners. They
are the cooler version of rectangles by all accounts.
</p>
<figure>
<img id="toasters" src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/frakkin-toasters.jpg" height="338" width="600" alt="Screengrab from Battlestar Galactica showing the diagram of a cylon, the main antagonist robot from the series. The diagram is on a piece of 8-inch by 11-inch paper with 45-degree angular corners on the page. There's a black manilla folder behind the piece of paper that also has its corners cut to the same angle.">
<figcaption>
<p>
<em>Even the physical paper documents in Battlestar Galactica were
sci-fi rectangles, how frakking cool is that!?</em>
</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
There were ways to <code>image-mask</code> or <code>clip-path</code>
yourself into a sci-fi rectangle with CSS, but those have some downsides
and mathematical complexities. It couldn’t be easier with
<code>corner-shape</code>, in fact it’s a two-liner:
</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>.sci-fi {
    border-start-end-radius: 50px;
    corner-shape: bevel;
}
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
My favorite version is probably when there’s two opposing corners
notched out:
</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>.even-more-sci-fi {
    border-start-start-radius: 50px;
    border-end-end-radius: 50px;
    corner-shape: bevel;
}
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<style>
#toasters {
    @supports (corner-shape: bevel) {
      border-start-end-radius: 50px;
      corner-shape: bevel;
    }
}

#demo {
  --space: 50px; 
  padding: var(--space); 
  corner-shape: bevel; 
  background: var(--overlay, #fff); 
  border: 2px solid var(--accent, #09f);
  transition: border-radius 0.2s;

  @supports (corner-shape: bevel) {
    border-start-start-radius: var(--space); 
    border-end-end-radius: var(--space); 

    &:hover,
    &:focus {
      --hover-border: calc(var(--space) *1.5);
      border-start-start-radius: var(--hover-border); 
      border-end-end-radius: var(--hover-border);
    }
  }
}

 #demo-fallback {
  margin-inline: auto;
 }

@supports (corner-shape: bevel) {
  #demo-fallback { display: none; }
}
</style>
<div id="demo" tabindex="0">
<p>If you’re in a browser that supports <code>corner-shape</code> or
have the experimental feature flag turned on, this paragraph will be a
sci-fi rectangle. If you see a normal rectangle, then I’ve included a
screenshot below for you.</p>
</div>
<img id="demo-fallback" src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2025/scifi-rectangle.png" alt="The same paragraph above but the borders are angular sci-fi rectangles" height="287" width="1000">
<p>
As demonstrated above <code>corner-shape</code> is a wonderful
progressive enhancement. A browser doesn’t support squircles? They get
rounded corners and the brand doesn’t fall over. You can also put
corner-shapes in <code><span class="citation"
data-cites="supports">@supports</span> (corner-shape: bevel)</code> for
even more graceful degradation. That’s what I did because a rounded
corner is totes un-sci-fi, so I only enable the corner-shape if
supported. Because <code>corner-shape</code> is not an
<code>image-mask</code> or a <code>clip-path</code>, they’re
automatically responsive and squeeze without any percentage-based
tomfoolery. They’re animatable too! You can transition them on hover or
focus if you want. The full power of CSS, baby!
</p>
<p>
One quirk I’ve discovered while playing with <code>corner-shape</code>
is that the default browser <code>:focus-visible</code> outline won’t
hug the corner-shape unless you re-define a custom
<code>:focus-visible</code> outline style. That strikes me as weird, so
<a href="https://codepen.io/davatron5000/pen/OPyWpxR">I made a little
reduced test case of this quirk</a> you can debug and tell me what
obvious tidbit I missed.
</p>
<p>
Wrapping this up, I’m excited about <code>corner-shape</code> because it
has real world implications. A product I work adjacent to is currently
shipping 215kb of squircle <code>clip-path</code> masks in production
right now. Yikes. That’s a lot for fancy rectangles.
<code>corner-shape</code> will be a sizable web performance improvement
for their users and reduce maintenance burdens over time. Wins all
around.
</p>
<p>
So remember, kids: Friends don’t let friends ship 200+ KB of squircles
in production. Talk to your friends about progressively enhanceable CSS
features today!

<h2 id="testing-a-reset-of-the-one-week-jail">2025-07-23 Testing a reset
of the one week jail</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-31, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2025-07-23-testing-a-reset-of-the-one-week-jail">
2025-07-23 Testing a reset of the one week jail
</h1>
<p>
I’ve had a number of people complaining about being banned and I’ve been
wondering whether I should reduce the ban-time for the escalation jail.
Right now, if you’ve been banned for 1h five times in a 24h period,
you’re banned for one week. What I f I reduced this one week to three
days (“one long weekend”), for example?
</p>
<p>
As a test, I wanted to reset all the one week bans and see whether load
explodes or not. If most of the scraping has ceased, then perhaps there
would be no problem?
</p>
<p>
So around 10:30 local time, I made a backup of the weekly jail:
</p>
<pre><code># fail2ban-client get butlerian-jihad-week banned &gt; butlerian-jihad-week.json
# sed s/\'/\&quot;/g &lt; butlerian-jihad-week.json | jq length
2862
# fail2ban-client get butlerian-jihad-week banned
[]
</code></pre>
<p>
The backup has 2862 entries, the jail is now empty.
</p>
<p>
Let’s watch Munin!
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-1.jpg" alt="The graph shows the one week jail pretty constant at nearly 3000 entries dropping to zero moments ago." />
</p>
<p>
40 minutes later. What are you dooooing‽
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-2.jpg" alt="10 minutes after the reset, the 1h jail already has over 700 entries and in another 10 minutes, it has 850 entries." />
</p>
<p>
And who’s doing it?
</p>
<pre><code># asn-find (grep &quot;^2025-07-23 1.* \[butlerian-jihad\] Ban &quot; /var/log/fail2ban.log|cut -c 89-)\

<p>
The only obvious thing I can see is that Semrush and Microsoft are
trying to crawl the site using their bots, one for their marketing and
search engine optimisation and the other for their search engine itself.
But remember: <a href="2023-10-04-search">2023-10-04 Search engines, the
deal is off!</a>. I am no longer convinced that being listed by search
engines is in my best interest.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-3.jpg" alt="A few hours later, the scene appears unchanged. There are four waves of blocks, going up to between 1000 and 1500 banned entries and coming back down again." />
</p>
<p>
If that’s the image, then perhaps the long term punitive ban doesn’t
have to be that long.
</p>
<p>
And what’s the situation 24h later?
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-4.jpg" alt="The fifth wave generates entries in the one-week ban. But the cycles for the one-hour ban continues and so more entries keep getting added to the one-week ban." />
</p>
<p>
And another day later:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-5.jpg" alt="The situation has stabilised around 1400 blocked entries." />
</p>
<p>
And another day later:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-6.jpg" alt="The bots were back and now we&rsquo;re at 2900 entries blocked for a week." />
</p>
<p>
Every day is worse. If you look at the graph below, you’ll notice that
Saturday morning just after 2:00 there was a huge wave of about 6000
entries that got blocked for an hour. The same wave repeats around 9:00,
13:00, 18:00. And then, nearly 24h later, just before 2:00, the fifth
such wave rolls in. At at that point, the bans are added to both the
one-hour and the one-week jail.
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2025-07-23-test-7.jpg" alt="The one-week ban now has 9000 entries after a surge at 1:50 in the morning adding about 6000 new entries" />

<p>
<strong>2025-07-25</strong>. So now, two days after a reset, I’d like to
see who’s hovering just below those limits I’ve set. If they seem to be
innocents, that would be an argument to raise the limits. If they seem
to be bots, that would be an argument to lower the limits or, given that
the system load is OK at the moment, to leave the limit as it is.
</p>
<p>
Let’s go through the various test.
</p>
<p>
First, “active autonomous systems”. On a good day, the limit is 500
requests per autonomous system.
</p>
<pre><code># show-active-autonomous-systems --top 3
count   percent ASN AS
234 4.54    45102   ALIBABA-CN-NET Alibaba US Technology Co., Ltd., CN
172 3.33    208258  ACCESS2IT Access2.IT Network, NL
158 3.06    12880   DCI-AS, IR
total: 5158
</code></pre>
<p>
Clearly, Alibaba is a bot hoster in China. What about Access2.IT in the
Netherlands?
</p>
<pre><code># 2h-access-log | asn-access-log 208258 | log-request | rank-lines 
    176 /
</code></pre>
<p>
Clearly, that is also a bot. 2h is 120 minutes. This company is checking
more than once per minute whether my sites are up. That angers me. They
probably sell uptime data to other companies.
</p>
<p>
What about the autonomous system from Iraq?
</p>
<pre><code># 2h-access-log | asn-access-log 12880 | log-request | rank-lines 
    164 /
</code></pre>
<p>
The same bullshit! 😲
</p>
<p>
So my conclusion is that the limit could be lower! 😠
</p>
<p>
Next, let’s look at “expensive end-points”. These are the endpoints I’m
planning to <a href="https://oddmuse.org/wiki/2025-07-13_AI_Scrapers">do
away with</a>, eventually.
</p>
<pre><code># 2h-access-log \
    | egrep '\baction=(rss|rc)\&amp;|\bsearch=' \
    | awk '{print $2}' \
    | asncounter --top 3 --no-prefixes 2&gt;/dev/null
count   percent ASN AS
27  4.42    7922    COMCAST-7922, US
11  1.8 6939    HURRICANE, US
8   1.31    7713    TELKOMNET-AS-AP PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia, ID
total: 611
</code></pre>
<p>
Comcast in the United States seems to request all sorts of things:
</p>
<pre><code># 2h-access-log | asn-access-log 7922 | log-request | rank-lines

</code></pre>
<p>
Note how only one of these requests is one of the “forbidden” URLs. But
apparently it’s also attempting to upload images! Looks like spiders, if
you ask me.
</p>
<p>
What about Hurricane in the United States?
</p>
<pre><code># 2h-access-log !^social | asn-access-log 6939 | log-user-agent | rank-lines

      4 Feedbin feed-id:1821891 - 1 subscribers
</code></pre>
<p>
What the hell is wrong with these people? Do I really have these many
interesting feeds?
</p>
<pre><code># 2h-access-log !^social | asn-access-log 6939 | log-request | rank-lines
      9 /view/index.rss

      3 /wiki/feed/full/RPG

</code></pre>
<p>
Maybe. 😬
</p>
<p>
Four requests means one request every half hour, for every feed. I guess
it makes sense.
</p>
<p>
In any case, I seems that maybe these autonomous systems are hitting a
lot of expensive end-points but in general, they are all focused on feed
processing.
</p>
<p>
The autonomous system from Indonesia looks even more like a bot but in
addition to that it also goes through all the archives, for every single
page:

Computing Benchmarks</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-31, updated: 2025-07-30, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Peter Gutmann and Stephan Neuhaus have a
<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1237.pdf">new paper</a>—I think
it’s new, even though it has a March 2025 date—that makes the argument
that we shouldn’t trust any of the quantum factorization benchmarks,
because everyone has been cooking the books:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Similarly, quantum factorisation is performed using sleight-of-hand
numbers that have been selected to make them very easy to factorise
using a physics experiment and, by extension, a VIC-20, an abacus, and a
dog. A standard technique is to ensure that the factors differ by only a
few bits that can then be found using a simple search-based approach
that has nothing to do with factorisation…. Note that such a value would
never be encountered in the real world since the RSA key generation
process typically requires that |p-q| &gt; 100 or more bits [9]. As one
analysis puts it, “Instead of waiting for the hardware to improve by yet
further orders of magnitude, researchers began inventing better and
better tricks for factoring numbers by exploiting their hidden
structure” [10]…

with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor-in-chief">EIC</a>
at Wired, saying the hype was bullshit. You hear this from journalists a
lot. The only way you can conclude this, imho, is if you aren’t using
the stuff. It’s as if you were a journalist in the 60s and said the
story of the Beatles is that their hair must be fake. OK, whatever you
say, but have you listened to the freaking music?? I’m sure a lot of
journalists in the 60s said bullshit like that but the Beatles did turn
the world upside down, and it stayed that way. It marked the beginning
of something very new. And, as with AI, <i>journalism missed the

approach. But that doesn’t mean they’re wrong about the value of the
tech. Develop sources the old fashioned way, and if you think money
biases the CEOs in favor of the hype, listen to experts who don’t have
any stock in the companies.</p>

<h2 id="before-i-go-always-buy-the-200-yamaha">Before I go: Always buy
the $200 Yamaha</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-30, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
I don’t have much life advice but I do know one thing: Always buy the
$200 Yamaha guitar.
</p>
<p>
If you’re thinking about it, do it. Talk to any guitarist you know who
has been playing awhile and they’ll have a story about a $200 Yamaha and
how good it sounds relative to the price. It’s with uncanny regularity I
encounter fellow travelers with a similar story about this particular
cheap guitar.
</p>
<p>
My $200 Yamaha story growing up was my step-dad’s acoustic. He had two
acoustic guitars actually; the Yamaha which stayed out propped against
his bedroom wall and another one (I don’t remember the brand) with fancy
jade inlays that stayed clasped in the green felt case under his bed. I
wasn’t supposed to touch any of his guitars but I would sneak in and
noodle on that Yamaha every chance I got. The Yamaha had a notable cheap
lacquer “clack” to it when tapping the dreadnaught body and the sound it
made when bumping into furniture was always harrowing, but the fretboard
was smooth and it produced a sound that was both bright and deep; a
surprise given the lightweight materials.
</p>
<p>
I stole some licks on the fancy under-the-bed acoustic a couple times,
but the luxury materials produced a tinny sound with no body or
resonance and despite its extra forbidden-ness it wasn’t even worth the
trouble digging out of its case. The Yamaha with its casual
out-of-the-case-because-I-only-cost-200-dollars vibes was not only
easier to access, it was better on all accounts.
</p>
<p>
Is the $200 Yamaha the best guitar? No, probably not. Is it a great
guitar? Emphatically, yes. An impeccable piece of Japanese engineering.
I’ve owned $2,000 guitars, played friends’ $4,000 guitars, and the $200
Yamaha gives them all a run for their money every time. Good entry-level
acoustic guitars from Martin and Taylor exist in the $500 range and
they’re great purchases you won’t regret, but it’s not until the $1500
range that you start getting the material quality bumps those guitars
deserve. But once you have a $1500 guitar, you start to baby it and hide
it away in the case to protect it from scratches and bumps, from air of
the wrong humidity, and from snoopy kids with clumsy hands. This is not
a problem with the $200 Yamaha.
</p>
<p>
We bought a $200 Yamaha last month: a 3/4ths scale travel guitar. We
went on a family beach vacation in July and my brother-in-law’s family
notified us the day before that the cousins were having a no-device
week. Worried our 12yo son would die –kidding, but he appreciates prior
warnings about adjustments like this and we weren’t prepared for a fully
offline week– we bought the $200 Yamaha to be an offline activity and
have zero regrets. He noodled all week long and got noticeably better.
Cousins and uncles even got into the mix trading riffs. It sounds
phenomenal for a mini-acoustic (like a big acoustic!) but more
importantly if it takes a tumble, gets stepped on by a toddler cousin,
or filled with sand; we’re not even upset. A perfect travel guitar if
there ever was.
</p>
<p>
Instruments are an intimate and personal item and choosing one can have
an Ollivander’s Wand Shop element to it; you must find the one that
speaks to you. And it’s up to you to treat yourself accordingly based on
your budget. But what I will say is, from a dollar-per-quality or a
cost-per-song perspective, you can’t go wrong with the $200 Yamaha.

“Who’s winning on the internet, the attackers or the defenders?”
</p>
<p>
I’m asked this all the time, and I can only ever give a qualitative
hand-wavy answer. But Jason Healey and Tarang Jain’s latest Lawfare
piece has
<a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/are-cyber-defenders-winning">amassed
data</a>.
</p>
<p>
The essay provides the first framework for metrics about how we are all
doing collectively—and not just how an individual network is doing.
Healey wrote to me in email:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The work rests on three key insights: (1) defenders need a framework
(based in threat, vulnerability, and consequence) to categorize the
flood of potentially relevant security metrics; (2) trends are what
matter, not specifics; and (3) to start, we should avoid getting bogged
down in collecting data and just use what’s already being reported by
amazing teams at Verizon, Cyentia, Mandiant, IBM, FBI, and so many
others…

Amen. Google sent an email saying my Google Fi account was going to be
cancelled if i didn’t do something, so I clicked the link, everything
looked fine. They sent more emails like this, again everything seemed in
order. I contacted them via support (hard to find) and they said
everything looked fine. They also said I should be sure there was enough
credit in the account. I wrote back saying that was insulting, I’ve been
a customer for a long time, and have never missed a payment, and they
should apologize for the threats and wasted time. I got back a
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/29/googleFiLotsOfWords.png">long
email</a> that did everything but apologize. They also threw in a little
gaslighting, talking about my emotional state (frustrated, unsettled).
Companies aren’t allowed to have opinions about customers’ emotions, esp
over email.

Just setting your camera’s shutter speed to match the refresh rate
<em>somewhat</em> closely is usually enough to make it at least bearable
(I start at 1/60th and see what looks least annoying).

But I recently discovered, while recording an old Macintosh Classic’s

actually amazing.

<p>But what about Substack and Ghost? A lot of people do their writing
there too? What about those people. Here’s the cool part for all people
who write on the web. The API we use in WordLand to hook up to WordPress
is
<a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/tree/trunk/packages/wpcom.js">open
and documented</a>. They don’t break their APIs in WordPressLand. At
least so far. You could say that API is a standard. And I bet it would
be a lot easier for Ghost, for example, to support a limited subset of
that API than it has been to get ActivityPub support implemented.
Because the WordPress API is what I would call “really simple,” and
that’s the thing I value most about a good API.</p>

<p>Now here’s the real reason I need
<a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a> and if you write for
WordPress sites, I think you’ll want it too. It’s because WordPress is
like the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word">Microsoft
Word</a> of web writing. If you ask someone how they do their site, in
2025, it’s probably going to be WordPress. So if someone invites you to
write a guest post on their blog, chances are pretty good I can write it
in WordLand, and it’ll be archived in my collection of writing, and easy
for me to find, because that’s what WordLand does for writers. So I was
able to create the new post on the WordCamp site in less than a minute,
and it was completely painless. And that’s the point. Here’s the screen
shot:</p>

<p>Listened to a segment on today’s
<a href="https://www.wnyc.org/shows/bl">Brian Lehrer podcast</a> about
how to keep the good feelings from a vacation when you get back home.
Here’s my idea. Before you leave make a list of the things you like
about being on vacation. Take it home, put it somewhere you can find it
when you’re feeling down and want that feeling back. Pick one of the
things on the list and do it. Your subconscious will tune into it as an
act of self-love and give you some of the body
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxytocin">chemistry</a> that you
felt when you were hanging out at the beach or hiking the Applachian
Trail. A similar idea in a

<p>Everything in ChatGPT is <i>so</i> nice. I just asked it about a
random plant I got as a gift, and it gave me a beautiful
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/28/deltaDawn.png">one
pager</a> with everything I would have had to spend time searching for
all right there, beautifully laid out, and all the fine UI touches you
might think of already in. It’s studying us and learning, and picking
out the good stuff, at least so far. The web was like this too in the
beginning, mind-exploding inventions every day. We called them
<a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2000/08/26/mindBombsForY2k.html">mind
bombs</a>. The journalists and social media influencers all just
complain, while there is a revolution happening, progress that had
slowed to a snail pace, or very often went in reverse, is now coming at
breakneck speed. This is as transformative innovation as there has ever
been, not that I have much perspective on those that happened before I
was invented, but it’s as big as the Beatles, the PC, web, mobile.</p>

I need <a href="https://wordland.social/">WordLand</a>. I’m primarily a
writer, my podcasts reflect that, so most of the work I do on each
podcast is in writing the show notes. I have a
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scripting/69436e223b212315846f5944e0957504">template</a>
the writing and audio flow through. Fairly standard stuff, the same
approach used by Tumblr and many other blogging systems, including
UserLand’s Manila and Radio UserLand. Here’s an
<a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/06/23/wordpressAndMe.html">example</a>
of a page rendered through that template. We’re doing similar things
with WordPress using themes. The idea of WordLand is to do all the
block-oriented work once, outside of the writing environment, then flow
my writing through it, far away from the heavy lifting. It’s always how
I’ve done my blogging tools. I understand WordPress so far has a steady
workflow thru the block editor, but these are workflows for designers
and programmers. WordLand is the flow for writers.</p>

<h1 id="2025-07-27-my-one-page-dungeon-contest-submission">
2025-07-27 My One Page Dungeon Contest submission
</h1>
<p>
It all started with agroschim proposing a game on the
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/MontagInZ%c3%bcrich/Discord_Server">Grenzland
Discord</a>: A pulp cover gets posted and we propose the title and
elevator pitch for the module we’d write for it.
</p>
<p>
The first cover was
<a href="https://www.perrypedia.de/wiki/Datei:PR0780.jpg">issue 780</a>
of the longest running Science Fiction series, Perry Rhodan. It shows
some dinosaurs, a river, canyon walls, and a flying golf-ball with
antennas like some sort of spy-satellite.
</p>
<p>
I wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Ugh Nugh and the bleeping Invasion: Gather your stoner friends, pick up
those spears and travel through the subterranean dinosaur refuge to find
the source of the flying drones that keep pestering your tribe.
Infiltrate the lair of the rocket men and wrest the eye of eyes from
their cold gauntlets and return your land to peace and quiet. A 16 page
module for Wolf Packs &amp; Winter Snow and other old school
role-playing games.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Once the words stood there, I liked it. The premise seemed to be
somewhat non-violent. This was a mission to stop some activity, not to
kill anything. It was about privacy and drones, which makes it relevant
to today. It’s about tech level differences and power differences. It
was intriguing.
</p>
<p>
And then I wrote up a One Page Dungeon based on that. 😍 There are
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/1pdc/2025/bleeping-bots/">two
versions</a> for the entry: the one-page PDF for submission to the
contest and
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/1pdc/2025/bleeping-bots/bleeping-bots.html">a
web page</a> with some old school D&amp;D stats.
</p>
<p>
It’s no way close to <a href="https://themetalearth.blogspot.com/">Metal
Earth</a>’s
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/1pdc/2011/Michael%20Gibbons%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Forgotten%20Depths.pdf">The
Forgotten Depths</a>, but clearly inspired by that 2012 entry, of
course. Back then I wrote up
<a href="2012-05-15_The_Forgotten_Depths">some stats</a> to go along
with the stat-less submission.
</p>
<p>
I feel that a first level group could conceivably beat it: get a suit at
the volcano or enlist the dragonodon, approach the tower undetected and
enter from above, then trick the only guard. Something like that. And I
feel the entry provides enough opportunities for a careless party to
mess up. 😆
</p>
<p>
Sadly, there’s no treasure to be found except blasters, rocket suits and
a charging station. But perhaps that is enough.

<p>On July 23 the X account of the Department of Homeland Security
posted an image of an 1872 oil painting by John Gast, titled American
Progress. Gast represented the American East on the right side of the
painting with light skies, a rising sun, and the bustling port of New
York City, full of ships. He painted the American West in darkness,
through which bison and Indigenous Americans flee the people in the
middle of the painting: white hunters, farmers, settlers, and stagecoach
riders. Over the scene floats a giant, blonde Lady Liberty, evidently
moving west, carrying a schoolbook and a telegraph wire being laced on
poles along a train track behind her.</p>

<p>date: 2025-07-27, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I wasn’t planning on this, but there was a
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/bingeworthySupport/issues/5">report</a>
that there was a problem with
<a href="https://tv.bingeworthy.org/">BingeWorthy</a>, looked into it
and was able to fix it.
</p>
<p>
Source of problem: When I added a feature that lets you ask ChatGPT to
review the program you’re looking at, I broke the ability to add a new
program to the database. It took about 15 minutes to track down and
verify and another few minutes to fix – and now that important function
works again.
</p>
<p>
As long as I was in there working around, I updated the
<a href="https://tv.bingeworthy.org/rss.xml">Bingeworthy RSS feed</a> to
only report program additions. The other events it was reporting just
weren’t as interesting.
</p>
<p>
I also added that feed to my
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2025/07/27/blogrolledBingeworthy.png">blogroll</a>
on <a href="http://scripting.com/">scripting.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
I’d say it works a lot better now.

<h2 id="a-social-media-ethos">A social media ethos</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-26, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
I’m trying to come up with an ethos of how I want to use social media.
What rules and constraints do I put around it. This is a living
document.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Rules for posting/reposting content:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Repost/Share cool links from the internet
</li>
<li>
Repost/Share cool art (and credit whenever possible)
</li>
<li>
Repost/Share people looking for work
</li>
<li>
Doubly-so if the people above are in tech and from an underrepresented
group
</li>
<li>
Repost/Share job listing from reputable companies
</li>
<li>
Then… if you’ve done all that, promote your own thing
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>General principles for me and my brain:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I have a bad habit of starting the day off with a goof, avoid this
</li>
<li>
I like riffing and puns but it can have reply-guy vibes, limit this
</li>
<li>
In any conversation you have 3 options: Be rude, Be nice, Say nothing –
the latter is usually the most correct answer
</li>
<li>
It’s okay to let people be wrong
</li>
<li>
Write down the issues you allow yourself to get outraged over
</li>
<li>
Read the room before posting
</li>
<li>
You can block/mute any person or channel for any reason, it’s fun
</li>
<li>
Research suggests it takes 23m15s to resume a task after a distraction!
</li>
<li>
Raycast Focus is your friend
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>On specific social-media apps:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
X is for Nazis and Russian bot nets, avoid.
</li>
<li>
FB/Instgram are for family and friends, use on occasion.
</li>
<li>
TikTok is a dopamine trap, avoid.
</li>
<li>
YouTube is a dopamine trap, but useful.
</li>
<li>
Bluesky is fine.
</li>
<li>
Mastodon is for quality conversations.
</li>
<li>
Discord is for like-minded communities, prioritize intimate ones.
</li>
<li>
Log into LinkedIn once a month and give some thumbs-ups. It supports
your friends and colleagues in the algorithmic trash fire and that
<em>handshakefullness</em> and relationship building might be helpful in
the future if you need a job.
</li>
</ul>

Memo</h2>
<p>date: 2025-07-26, from: Om Malik blog</p>
<p>To paraphrase Sigmund Freud, sometimes a memo is not just a
memo. That’s why we have to read between the lines of Satya Nadella’s
1,150-word memo. Microsoft’s chairman and CEO, in his message, tried to
rationalize the 9,000-employee layoff. I was interested in how he was
positioning the AI-based disruption in the software industry. This memo
is not just about Microsoft. In a way, it’s a weather forecast for the
rest of …</p>

<p>Here is my answer to the question Does SiriusXM know what station you
are listening to? The SiriusXM streaming app logs what you listen to,
when, and how you interact with programs and channels across your
devices (phone, pad, smart speaker, website through your browser,
whatever). This data is used to personalize your “experience” (as

<p>Colbert’s cancellation looks political, but it’s not. The show was a
ratings winner, but a money loser. And the ratings for all of late
night, like all of live TV, have been in decline for decades, along with
the question, “What’s on?” We live in the Age of Optionality now. Watch

It has been a busy few weeks!
<a href="https://shadycharacters.co.uk/books/face-with-tears-of-joy/"><cite>Face
with Tears of Joy</cite></a> was published back on the 1<sup>st</sup> of
July in the <abbr class="initialism">US</abbr> and on the
17<sup>th</sup> everywhere else. I’ve been lucky enough to talk and
write about the book in a number of different venues, and for the book
itself to be reviewed in a variety of places. Here’s a quick round-up of
it all.
