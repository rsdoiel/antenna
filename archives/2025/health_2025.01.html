milk oligosaccharides: bridging the gap in intestinal microbiota between
mothers and infants</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>Breast milk is an essential source of infant nutrition. It is also a
vital determinant of the structure and function of the infant intestinal
microbial community, and it connects the mother and infant intestinal
microbiota. Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are a critical component
in breast milk. HMOs can reach the baby’s colon entirely from milk and
become a fermentable substrate for some intestinal microorganisms. HMOs
can enhance intestinal mucosal barrier function and affect the
intestinal function of the host through immune function, which has a
therapeutic effect on specific infant intestinal diseases, such as
necrotizing enterocolitis. In addition, changes in infant intestinal
microbiota can reflect the maternal intestinal microbiota. HMOs are a
link between the maternal intestinal microbiota and infant intestinal
microbiota. HMOs affect the intestinal microbiota of infants and are
related to the maternal milk microbiota. Through breastfeeding, maternal
microbiota and HMOs jointly affect infant intestinal bacteria.
Therefore, HMOs positively influence the establishment and balance of
the infant microbial community, which is vital to ensure infant
intestinal function. Therefore, HMOs can be used as a supplement and
alternative therapy for infant intestinal diseases.</p>

falciparum transcription factor AP2-06B is mutated at high frequency in
Southeast Asia but does not associate with drug resistance</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionA continuing challenge for malaria control is the ability
of Plasmodium falciparum to develop resistance to antimalarial drugs.
Members within the Plasmodium transcription factor family AP2 regulate
the growth and development of the parasite, and are also thought to be
involved in unclear aspects of drug resistance. Here we screened for
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the AP2 family and
identified 6 non-synonymous mutations within AP2-06B (PF3D7_0613800),
with allele frequencies greater than 0.05. One mutation, K3124R, was
located in a PfAP2-06B AP2 domain.MethodsTo investigate transcriptional
regulation by PfAP2-06B, ChIP-seq assays were performed on
3D7/PfAP2-06B-GFP schizonts using antibodies against GFP. The DNA
sequences of the artemisinin-resistant CWX and the quinoline-resistant
strains PfDd2 and Pf7G8 were analyzed for the genetic diversity of
AP2-06B, compared with the Pf3D7 strain as a reference sequence. To
determine whether AP2-06B can alter the expression of pfk13 and pfcrt,
as well as cause artemisinin and quinoline resistance in Plasmodium, we
generated both a K3124R mutation and conditional knockdown of AP2-06B in
Pf3D7 using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing.ResultsChIP-Seq analysis
showed that AP2-06B can bind to the loci of the Plasmodium genes pfk13
and pfcrt. The AP2-06B K3124R mutation was also found in the
artemisinin-resistant parasite strain CWX and the chloroquine-resistant
strains Dd2 and 7G8. Contrary to expectation, Pf3D7 Plasmodium lines
modified by either K3124R mutation of AP2-06B or conditional knockdown
of AP2-06B did not have altered sensitivity to artemisinin or quinolines
by modulating pfk13 or pfcrt expression.DiscussionAP2-06B was predicted
to be associated with artemisinin and quinoline resistance, but no
change in resistance was observed after mutation or conditional
knockdown. Given the multigenic nature of resistance, it might be
difficult to recreate a resistance phenotype. In conclusion, whether
AP2-06B regulates the development of artemisinin or quinoline resistance
remains to be studied.</p>

the production and efficacy of antimicrobial bioactive compounds from
Streptomyces kanamyceticus in combating multi-drug-resistant
pathogens</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundThe rise of antibiotic-resistant pathogens has intensified
the search for novel antimicrobial agents. This study aimed to isolate
Streptomyces kanamyceticus from local soil samples and evaluate its
antimicrobial properties, along with optimizing the production of
bioactive compounds.MethodsSoil samples were collected from local
regions, processed, and analysed for Streptomyces strains isolation
using morphological characteristics and molecular identification through
16S rRNA gene PCR assay. Antimicrobial activity was assessed against
Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Candida
albicans using the double-layer method, while Minimum Inhibitory
Concentration (MIC) values were determined. The extracted compounds
underwent Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis for
functional group identification. Optimization of bioactive compound
production was performed using a Central Composite Design (CCD) coupled
with Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR).ResultsA total of 25
distinct Streptomyces strains were isolated, with seven confirmed as S.
kanamyceticus. These strains exhibited antimicrobial activity, with
inhibition zones reaching 30 mm and MIC values between 20 and 70 µg/mL.
The extraction yielded 150-200 mL of bioactive compounds. Optimization
studies revealed that a medium containing 10 g/L glucose and 10 g/L
glycine max meal maximized antibiotic production.ConclusionThis study
confirmed that S. kanamyceticus is a promising source of novel
antibiotics. The combination of microbial isolation, antimicrobial
testing, and statistical optimization successfully enhanced the
production of bioactive compounds, contributing to the search for
effective antimicrobial agents against resistant pathogens.</p>

and hydrogen sulfide - new insights into gut microbiota and male
infertility through meta-analysis</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>BackgroundAmmonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are produced
during digestion in the human gut, yet the impact of these internally
generated gases on male reproduction have received limited attention in
scientific research.MethodsWe systematically reviewed 935 scientific
publications, spanning from 1947 to 2023, focusing on external or
internal NH3 and/or H2S, male infertility, and gut microbiota.
Meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the summary relative risk (RR)
and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of combined studies.ResultsOur
findings revealed that the internal NH3 and/or H2S were negatively
related to the Lactobacillus, which is beneficial to male fertility,
whereas NH3 and H2S were positively related to Bacteroides, which showed
negative effects on male fertility. The meta-analysis comparing
Lactobacillus and Bacteroides levels with NH3 showed statistically
significant results (p&lt;0.001).ConclusionsThe meta-analysis is the
first to confirm these facts and explored the potential existence of a
gut microbiota-inner gases-male fertility axis in the human gut.</p>

rate of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections in
hospitalized immunocompromised pediatric patients</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, from: Frontiers in Cellular and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>IntroductionMultidrug resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections
are considered a major public health threat. Immunocompromised pediatric
patients are at a great risk of severe or overwhelming infections. The
aim of this study was to describe the frequency of infections with
multidrug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) in
immunocompromised pediatric patients and to determine the risk factors.
In addition, we aimed to identify the antimicrobial resistance patterns
of these isolates.Materials and methodsThis was a retrospective
observational study conducted at the American University of Beirut
Medical Center (AUBMC) from 2009 to 2017. The study included
immunocompromised patients 18 years of age or younger with infections
caused by Gram-negative bacteria isolated from a sterile site, or
nonsterile site in the setting of clinical infection.ResultsA total of
381 episodes of infection with GNB in 242 immunocompromised pediatric
patients were identified. The mean age was 7.7 years. The most common
pathogens were Enterobacterales followed by Pseudomonas and
Acinetobacter spp. MDR GNB infections predominated causing 72% of the
episodes, with alarming MDR rates among Escherichia coli (95.7%) and
Klebsiella pneumoniae (82.7%). The overall rate of MDR GNB isolated
increased from 62.7% in 2015 to 90% in 2017. Thrombocytopenia,
chemotherapy and previous colonization or infection with the same
organism during the past 12 months were found to be independent risk
factors for infection with MDR GNB.ConclusionThis study provides data on
the epidemiology of infections with MDR GNB in immunocompromised
pediatric patients and illustrates the alarmingly high prevalence of
these infections. This necessitates the frequent revisiting of treatment
guidelines in these high-risk patients and the implementation of
judicious antimicrobial stewardship programs and infection control
policies to stabilize or decrease the prevalence of these
infections.</p>
