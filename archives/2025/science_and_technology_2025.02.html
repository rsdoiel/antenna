<h2 id="the-history-and-use-of-etcglob-in-early-unixes">The history and
use of /etc/glob in early Unixes</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>One of the innovations that the V7 Bourne shell introduced was built
in shell wildcard globbing, which is to say expanding things like *, ?,
and so on. Of course Unix had shell wildcards well before V7, but in V6
and earlier, the shell didn’t implement globbing itself; instead this
was delegated to an external program, /etc/glob (this affects things
like looking into the history of Unix shell wildcards, because you have
to know to look at the glob source, not the shell). ↫ Chris Siebenmann I
never knew expanding wildcars in UNIX shells was once done by a separate
program, but if you stop and think about the original UNIX philosophy,
it kind of makes sense. On a slightly related note, I’m currently very
deep into setting up, playing with, and actively using HP-UX 11i v1 on
the HP c8000 I was able to buy thanks to countless donations from you
all, OSNews readers, and one of the things I want to get working is
email in dtmail, the CDE email program. However, dtmail is old, and
wants you to do email the UNIX way: instead of dtmail retrieving and
sending email itself, it expects other programs to those tasks for you.
In other words, to setup and use dtmail (instead of relying on a 2010
port of Thunderbird), I’ll have to learn how to set up things like
sendmail, fetchmail, or alternatives to those tools. Those programs will
in turn dump the emails in the maildir format for dtmail to work with.
Configuring these tools could very well be above my paygrade, but I’ll
do my best to try and get it working – I think it’s more authentic to
use something like dtmail than a random Thunderbird port. In any event,
this, too, feels very UNIX-y, much like delegating wildcard expansion to
a separate program. What this also shows is that the “UNIX philosophy”
was subject to erosion from the very beginning, and really isn’t a
modern phenomenon like many people seem to imply. I doubt many of the
people complaining about the demise of the UNIX philosophy today even
knew wildcard expansion used to be done by a separate program.</p>
