id="google-announces-its-going-to-intentionally-violate-eu-law">Google
announces it’s going to intentionally violate EU law</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>Google has told the EU it will not add fact checks to search results
and YouTube videos or use them in ranking or removing content, despite
the requirements of a new EU law, according to a copy of a letter
obtained by Axios. In a letter written to Renate Nikolay, the deputy
director general under the content and technology arm at the European
Commission, Google’s global affairs president Kent Walker said the
fact-checking integration required by the Commission’s new
Disinformation Code of Practice “simply isn’t appropriate or effective
for our services” and said Google won’t commit to it. ↫ Sara Fischer at
Axios Imagine if any one of us, ordinary folk told the authorities we
were just not going to follow the law. We’re not going to pay our taxes
because tax law “simply isn’t appropriate or effective for our
services”. We’re not going to follow traffic laws and regulations
because doing so “simply isn’t appropriate or effective for our
services”. We’re not going to respect property laws because doing so
“simply isn’t appropriate or effective for our services”. We’d be in
trouble within a heartbeat. We’d be buried in fines, court cases, and
eventually, crippling debt, bankruptcy, and most likely end up in
prison. The arrogance with which these American tech giants willfully
declare themselves to be above EU laws and regulations is appalling, and
really should have far more consequences than it does right now.
Executives should be charged and arrested, products and services banned
and taken off the shelves, and eventually, the companies themselves
should be banned from operating within the EU altogether. Especially
with the incoming regime in the US, which will most likely grant the
tech giants even more freedom to do as they please, the EU needs to
start standing up against this sort of gross disrespect. The
consequences for a corporation knowingly breaking the law should be just
as grave as for an individual citizen knowingly breaking the law.</p>

id="microsoft-will-also-stop-supporting-office-applications-on-windows-10-after-october-14">Microsoft
will also stop supporting Office applications on Windows 10 after
October 14</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>It seems we’re getting a glimpse at the next stick Microsoft will be
using to push people to buy new PCs (we’re all rich, according to
Microsoft) or upgrade to Windows 11. In a blog post extolling the
virtues of a free upgrade from Windows 10 to 11, the company announced
that with the end of support for Windows 10, Microsoft will also stop
supporting Office applications on Windows 10, otherwise known as Office
365. Lastly, Microsoft 365 Apps will no longer be supported after
October 14, 2025, on Windows 10 devices. To use Microsoft 365
Applications on your device, you will need to upgrade to Windows 11. ↫
Microsoft’s Margaret Farmer Of course, the applications won’t stop
working on Windows 10 right away after that date, but Microsoft won’t be
fixing any security issues, bugs, or other issues that might (will) come
up. It reads like a threat to Windows users – upgrade by buying a new PC
you probably can’t afford, or not only use an insecure version of
Windows, but also insecure Office applications. I doubt it’ll have much
of an impact on the staggering number of people still using Windows 10 –
more than 60% of Windows users – so I’m sure Microsoft has more
draconian plans up its sleeve to push people to upgrade.</p>

<h2 id="nepenthes-a-dangerous-tarpit-to-trap-llm-crawlers">Nepenthes: a
dangerous tarpit to trap LLM crawlers</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>If you don’t want OpenAI’s, Apple’s, Google’s, or other companies’
crawlers sucking up the content on your website, there isn’t much you
can do. They generally don’t care about the venerable robots.txt, and
while people like Aaron Schwartz were legally bullied into suicide for
downloading scientific articles using a guest account, corporations are
free to take whatever they want, permission or no. If corporations don’t
respect us, why should we respect them? There are ways to fight back
against these scrapers, and the latest is especially nasty in all the
right ways. This is a tarpit intended to catch web crawlers.
Specifically, it’s targeting crawlers that scrape data for LLM’s – but
really, like the plants it is named after, it’ll eat just about anything
that finds its way inside. It works by generating an endless sequences
of pages, each of which with dozens of links, that simply go back into
the tarpit. Pages are randomly generated, but in a deterministic way,
causing them to appear to be flat files that never change. Intentional
delay is added to prevent crawlers from bogging down your server, in
addition to wasting their time. Lastly, optional Markov-babble can be
added to the pages, to give the crawlers something to scrape up and
train their LLMs on, hopefully accelerating model collapse. ↫ ZADZMO.org
You really have to know what you’re doing when you set up this tool. It
is intentionally designed to cause harm to LLM web crawlers, but it
makes no distinction between LLM crawlers and, say, search engine
crawlers, so it will definitely get you removed from search results. On
top of that, because Nepenthes is designed to feed LLM crawlers what
they’re looking for, they’re going to love your servers and thus spike
your CPU load constantly. I can’t reiterate enough that you should not
be using this if you don’t know what you’re doing. Setting it all up is
fairly straightforward, but of note is that if you want to use the
Markov generation feature, you’ll need to provide your own corpus for it
to feed from. None is included to make sure every installation of
Nepenthes will be different and unique because users will choose their
own corpus to set up. You can use whatever texts you want, like
Wikipedia articles, royalty-free books, open research corpuses, and so
on. Nepenthes will also provide you with statistics to see what cats
you’ve dragged in. You can use Nepenthes defensively to prevent LLM
crawlers from reaching your real content, while also collecting the IP
ranges of the crawlers so you can start blocking them. If you’ve got
enough bandwith and horsepower, you can also opt to use Nepenthes
offensively, and you can have some real fun with this. Let’s say you’ve
got horsepower and bandwidth to burn, and just want to see these AI
models burn. Nepenthes has what you need: Don’t make any attempt to
block crawlers with the IP stats. Put the delay times as low as you are
comfortable with. Train a big Markov corpus and leave the Markov module
enabled, set the maximum babble size to something big. In short, let
them suck down as much bullshit as they have diskspace for and choke on
it. ↫ ZADZMO.org In a world where we can’t fight back against LLM
crawlers in a sensible and respectful way, tools like these are exactly
what we need. After all, the imbalance of power between us normal people
and corporations is growing so insanely out of any and all proportions,
that we don’t have much choice but to attempt to burn it all down with
more… Destructive methods. I doubt this will do much to stop LLM
crawlers from taking whatever they want without consent – as I’ve
repeatedly said, Silicon Valley does not understand consent – but at
least it’s joyfully cathartic.</p>

id="a-microsoft-change-to-the-linux-kernel-caused-major-breakage-but-was-caught-in-time">A
Microsoft change to the Linux kernel caused major breakage, but was
caught in time</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>A change to the Linux 6.13 kernel contributed by a Microsoft engineer
ended up changing Linux x86_64 code without proper authorization and in
turn causing troubles for users and now set to be disabled ahead of the
Linux 6.13 stable release expected next Sunday. ↫ Michael Larabel What I
like about this story is that it seems to underline that the processes,
checks, and balances in place in Linux kernel development seem to be
working – at least, this time. A breaking change was caught during the
prerelease phase, and a fix has been merged to make sure this issue will
be fixed before the stable version of Linux 6.13 is released to the
wider public. This all sounds great, but there is an element of this
story that raises some serious questions. The change itself was related
to EXECMEM_ROX, and was intended to improve performance of 64bit AMD and
Intel processors, but in turn, this new code broke Control Flow
Integrity on some setups, causing some devices not to wake from
hibernation while also breaking other features. What makes this spicy is
that the code was merged without acknowledgement from any of the x86
kernel maintainers, which made a lot of people very unhappy – and
understandably so. So while the processes and checks and balances worked
here, something still went horribly wrong, as such changes should not be
able to be merged without acknowledgement from maintainers. This now
makes me wonder how many more times this has happened without causing
any instantly discoverable issues. For now, some code has been added to
revert the offending changes, and Linux 6.13 will ship with Microsoft’s
bad code disabled.</p>

allows advertisers to fingerprint you for even better tracking</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>They tried to keep it from prying eyes, but several people did notice
it: Google made a pretty significant policy change regarding the use of
fingerprinting by advertisers. While Google did not allow advertisers to
use digital fingerprinting, the company has now changed its mind on this
one. Google really tried to hide this change. The main support article
talking about the reasoning behind the change is intentionally obtuse
and nebulous, and doesn’t even link to the actual policy changes being
implemented – which are found in a separate document. Google doesn’t
highlight its changes there, so you have to compare the two versions of
the policy yourself. Google claims this change has to be implemented
because of “advances in privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) such as
on-device processing, trusted execution environments, and secure
multi-party computation” and “the rise of new ad-supported devices and
platforms”. What I think this word salad means is that users are
regaining a modicum of privacy with some specific privacy-preserving
features in certain operating systems and on certain devices, and that
the use of dedicated, siloed streaming services is increasing, which is
harder for Google and advertisers to track. In other words, Google is
relaxing its rules on fingerprinting because we’re all getting more
conscious about privacy. In any event, the advice remains the same: use
ad-blockers, preferably at your network level. Install adblocking
software and extensions, set up a Pi-Hole, or turn on any adblocking
features in your router (my Ubiquiti router has it built-in, and it
works like a charm). Remember: your device, your rules. If you don’t
want to see ads, you don’t have to.</p>

<h2 id="fm-towns-technical-databook-partially-translated-to-english">FM
TOWNS Technical Databook partially translated to English</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>In recent months, we’ve talked twice about FM Towns, Fujitsu’s PC
platform aimed solely at the Japanese market. It was almost entirely
only available in Japanese, so it’s difficult to explore for those of us
who don’t speak Japanese. There’s an effort underway to recreate it as
open source, which will most likely take a while, but in the meantime, a
part of the FM TOWNS Technical Databook, written by Noriaki Chiba, has
been translated from Japanese into English by Joe Groff. From the book’s
preface: That is why the author wrote this book, to serve as an
essential manual for enthusiasts, systems developers, and software
developers. Typical computer manuals do not adequately cover technical
specifications, so users tend to have a hard time understanding the
hardware. We have an opportunity to thoroughly break through this
barrier, and with this new hardware architecture being a milestone in
the FM series, it feels like the perfect time to try. Hardware manuals
up to this point have typically only explained the consequences of the
hardware design without explaining its fundamentals. By contrast, this
book describes the hardware design of the TOWNS from its foundations.
Since even expert systems developers can feel like amateurs when working
with devices outside of their repertoire, this book focuses on
explaining those foundations. This is especially necessary for the FM
TOWNS, since it features so many new devices, including a 80386 CPU and
a CD-ROM drive. ↫ Noriaki Chiba This handbook goes into great detail
about the inner workings of the hardware, and chapter II, which hasn’t
been translated yet, also dives deep into the BIOS of the hardware, from
its first revisions to all the additional features added on top as time
progressed. This book, as well as its translation, will be invaluable to
people trying to use Towns OS today, to developers working on emulators
for the platform, and anyone who fits somewhere in between. It seems
this translation was done entirely in Groff’s free time as a side
project, which is commendable. We’re looking at about 65000 words in the
target language, of a highly technical nature, all translated for free
because someone decided it was worth it. Sending this over to a
translation agency would most likely cost well over €10000. Of course,
that would include additional editing and proofreading by parties other
than the initial translator(s), but that’s definitely not needed for a
passion project like this. Excellent, valuable work.</p>

<p>When someone says you’re biased against them because you object to
their stated goal of removing you from society, they’re not actually
asking for fairness — they’re demanding complicity. It’s the political
equivalent of asking why the gazelle seems to have such a negative view
of lions. Think about the underlying logic here: I’m biased because I
don’t give equal weight to both sides of a debate about my fundamental
rights. I’m biased because I notice patterns in political movements that
explicitly state their intentions regarding people like me. I’m biased
because I take them at their word when they tell me what they plan to
do. ↫ Joan Westenberg OSNews and I will always stand for the right of

Haitzler That’s it. That’s the release notes. Digging into the commit

updated translations, some RandR work, and a ton of other small changes.
Does any one of us use Enlightenment on a daily basis? I’m actually

you complete the Oregon Trail if you wait at a river for 14272 years: a
study</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>Two years ago, Twitch streamer albrot discovered a bug in the code
for crossing rivers. One of the options is to “wait to see if conditions
improve”; waiting a day will consume food but not recalculate any health
conditions, granting your party immortality. From this conceit the
Oregon Trail Time Machine was born; a multiday livestream of the game as
the party waits for conditions to improve at the final Snake River
crossing until the year 10000, to see if the withered travellers can
make it to the ruins of ancient Oregon. The first attempt ended in
tragedy; no matter what albrot tried, the party would succumb to disease
and die almost immediately. A couple of days before New Years Eve 2025,
albrot reached out and asked if I knew anything about Apple II hacking.
↫ Scott Percival It may have required some reverse engineering and
hackery, but yes, you can reach the ruins of Oregon in the year
16120.</p>

<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>Mastodon, the only remaining social network that isn’t a fascist
hellhole like Twitter or Facebook, is changing its legal and operational
foundation to a proper European non-profit. Simply, we are going to
transfer ownership of key Mastodon ecosystem and platform components
(including name and copyrights, among other assets) to a new non-profit
organization, affirming the intent that Mastodon should not be owned or
controlled by a single individual. It also means a different role for
Eugen, Mastodon’s current CEO. Handing off the overall Mastodon
management will free him up to focus on product strategy where his
original passion lies and he gains the most satisfaction. ↫ Official
Mastodon blog Eugen Rochko has always been clear and steadfast about
Mastodon not being for sale and not accepting any outside investments
despite countless offers, and after eight years of both creating and
running Mastodon, it makes perfect sense to move the network and its
assets to a proper European non-profit. Mastodon’s actual control over
the entire federated ActivityPub network – the Fediverse – is actually
limited, so it’s not like the network is dependent on Mastodon, but
there’s no denying it’s the most well-known part of the Fediverse. The
Fediverse is the only social network on which OSNews is actively present
(and myself, too, for that matter). By “actively present” I only mean
I’m keeping an eye on any possible replies; the feed itself consists
exclusively of links to our stories as soon as they’re published, and
that’s it. Everything else you might encounter on social media is either
legacy cruft we haven’t deleted yet, or something a third-party set up
that we don’t control. RSS means it’s easy for people to set up
third-party, unaffiliated accounts on any social medium posting links to
our stories, and that’s entirely fine, of course. However, corporate
social media controlled by the irrational whims of delusional
billionaires with totalitarian tendencies is not something we want to be
a part of, so aside from visiting OSNews.com and using our RSS feeds,
the only other official way to follow OSNews is on Mastodon.</p>

<h2 id="wordpress-is-in-trouble">WordPress is in trouble</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s hard to see how to move forward from here. I think the best bet
would be for people to rally around a new community-driven
infrastructure. This would likely require a fork of WordPress, though,
and that’s going to be a messy. The current open source version of
WordPress relies on the sites and services Mullenweg controls. Joost de
Valk, the original creator of an extremely popular SEO plugin, wrote a
blog post with some thoughts on the matter. I’m hoping that more
prominent people in the community step up like this, and that some way
forward can be found. Update: Moments after posting this, I was pointed
to a story on TechCrunch about Mullenweg deactivating the WordPress.org
accounts of users planning a “fork”. This after he previously promoted
(though in a slightly mocking way) the idea of forking open source
software. In both cases, the people he mentioned weren’t actually
planning forks, but musing about future ways forward for WordPress.
Mullenweg framed the account deactivations as giving people the push
they need to get started. Remember that WordPress.org accounts are
required to submit themes, plugins, or core code to the WordPress
project. These recent events really make it seem like you’re no longer
welcome to contribute to WordPress if you question Matt Mullenweg. ↫
Gavin Anderegg I haven’t wasted a single word on the ongoing WordPress
drama yet, but the longer Matt Mullenweg, Automattic’s CEO and thus
owner of WordPress, keeps losing his mind, I can’t really ignore the
matter any more. OSNews runs, after all, on WordPress – self-hosted, at
least, so not on Mullenweg’s WordPress.com – and if things keep going
the way they are, I simply don’t know if WordPress remains a viable,
safe, and future-proof CMS for OSNews. I haven’t discussed this
particular situation with OSNews owner, David Adams, yet, mostly since
he’s quite hands-off in the day-to-day operations and has more than
enough other matters to take care of, but I think the time has come to
start planning for a potential worst-case scenario in which Mullenweg
takes even more of whatever he’s taking and WordPress implodes entirely.
Remember – even if you self-host WordPress outside of Automattic,
several core infrastructure parts of WordPress still run through
Automattic, so we’re still dependent on what Mullenweg does or doesn’t
do. I have no answers, announcements, or even plans at this point, but
if you or your company depend on WordPress, you might want to start
thinking about where to go from here.</p>

<h2 id="the-history-and-use-of-etcglob-in-early-unixes">The history and
use of /etc/glob in early Unixes</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>One of the innovations that the V7 Bourne shell introduced was built
in shell wildcard globbing, which is to say expanding things like *, ?,
and so on. Of course Unix had shell wildcards well before V7, but in V6
and earlier, the shell didn’t implement globbing itself; instead this
was delegated to an external program, /etc/glob (this affects things
like looking into the history of Unix shell wildcards, because you have
to know to look at the glob source, not the shell). ↫ Chris Siebenmann I
never knew expanding wildcars in UNIX shells was once done by a separate
program, but if you stop and think about the original UNIX philosophy,
it kind of makes sense. On a slightly related note, I’m currently very
deep into setting up, playing with, and actively using HP-UX 11i v1 on
the HP c8000 I was able to buy thanks to countless donations from you
all, OSNews readers, and one of the things I want to get working is
email in dtmail, the CDE email program. However, dtmail is old, and
wants you to do email the UNIX way: instead of dtmail retrieving and
sending email itself, it expects other programs to those tasks for you.
In other words, to setup and use dtmail (instead of relying on a 2010
port of Thunderbird), I’ll have to learn how to set up things like
sendmail, fetchmail, or alternatives to those tools. Those programs will
in turn dump the emails in the maildir format for dtmail to work with.
Configuring these tools could very well be above my paygrade, but I’ll
do my best to try and get it working – I think it’s more authentic to
use something like dtmail than a random Thunderbird port. In any event,
this, too, feels very UNIX-y, much like delegating wildcard expansion to
a separate program. What this also shows is that the “UNIX philosophy”
was subject to erosion from the very beginning, and really isn’t a
modern phenomenon like many people seem to imply. I doubt many of the
people complaining about the demise of the UNIX philosophy today even
knew wildcard expansion used to be done by a separate program.</p>

It’s a meandering story of complexity, but eventually, a corrupted
graphical session appeared. Now the real work starts.</p>

launches Chromium development fund to ward off antitrust concerns</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>Don’t you just love it when companies get together under the thin
guise of open source to promote their own interests? Today Google is
pleased to announce our partnership with The Linux Foundation and the
launch of the Supporters of Chromium-based Browsers. The goal of this
initiative is to foster a sustainable environment of open-source
contributions towards the health of the Chromium ecosystem and
financially support a community of developers who want to contribute to
the project, encouraging widespread support and continued technological
progress for Chromium embedders. The Supporters of Chromium-based
Browsers fund will be managed by the Linux Foundation, following their
long established practices for open governance, prioritizing
transparency, inclusivity, and community-driven development. We’re
thrilled to have Meta, Microsoft, and Opera on-board as the initial
members to pledge their support. ↫ Shruthi Sreekanta on the Chromium
blog First, there’s absolutely no way around the fact that this entire
effort is designed to counter some of the antitrust actions against
Google, including a possible forced divestment of Chrome. By setting up
an additional fund atop the Chromium organisation, placed under the
management of the Linux Foundation, Google creates the veneer of more
independence for Chromium than their really is. In reality, however,
Chromium is very much a Google-led project, with 94% of code
contributions coming from Google, and with the Linux Foundation being
very much a corporate affair, of which Google itself is a member, one
has to wonder just how much it means that the Linux Foundation is
managing this new fund. Second, the initial members of this fund don’t
exactly instill confidence in the fund’s morals and values. We’ve got
Google, the largest online advertising company in the world. Then
there’s Facebook, another major online advertising company, followed by
Microsoft, which, among other business ventures, is also a major online
advertising company. Lastly we have Opera, an NFT and cryptoscammer
making money through predatory loans in poor countries. It’s a veritable
who’s who of some of the companies you least want near anything related
to your browsing experience. I highly doubt a transparent effort like
this is going to dissuade any judge or antritrust regulator from backing
down. It’s clear this fund is entirely self-serving and designed almost
exclusively for optics, with an obvious bias towards online advertising
companies who want to make the internet worse than towards companies and
people trying to make the internet better.</p>

<h4>
Even better use for the Technic range than the Mars Rover – with one big
caveat
</h4>
<p>
The original Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle had the look of something that
had been strung together from an oversized Meccano set. It should,
therefore, not come as a surprise to find a LEGO variant built from the
company's Technic pieces.…
