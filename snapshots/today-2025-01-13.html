<p>date: 2025-01-12, from: Liliputing</p>
<p>
Nokia was one of the biggest names in the cellphone business until
smartphones came along and the company struggled to compete. Microsoft
acquired Nokia’s smartphone division in 2014 in an effort to make
Windows phones a thing. After failed spectacularly, Nokia made a
licensing deal in 2016 that would allow HMD to release Nokia-branded
smartphones. […]

<h2 id="generative-ai-the-power-and-the-glory">Generative AI – The Power
and the Glory</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, updated: 2025-01-12, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/liebreich-generative-ai-the-power-and-the-glory/">Generative
AI – The Power and the Glory</a></strong>
</p>
Michael Liebreich’s epic report for BloombergNEF on the current state of
play with regards to generative AI, energy usage and data center growth.
</p>
<p>
I learned <em>so much</em> from reading this. If you’re at all
interested in the energy impact of the latest wave of AI tools I
recommend spending some time with this article.
</p>
<p>
Just a few of the points that stood out to me:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
This isn’t the first time a leap in data center power use has been
predicted. In 2007 the EPA predicted data center energy usage would
double: it didn’t, thanks to efficiency gains from better servers and
the shift from in-house to cloud hosting. In 2017 the WEF predicted
cryptocurrency could consume <em>al</em> the world’s electric power by
2020, which was cut short by the first crypto bubble burst. Is this time
different? <em>Maybe</em>.
</li>
<li>
Michael re-iterates (Sequoia) David Cahn’s
<a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ais-600b-question/">$600B
question</a>, pointing out that if the anticipated infrastructure spend
on AI requires $600bn in annual revenue that means 1 billion people will
need to spend $600/year or 100 million intensive users will need to
spend $6,000/year.
</li>
<li>
Existing data centers often have a power capacity of less than 10MW, but
new AI-training focused data centers tend to be in the 75-150MW range,
due to the need to colocate vast numbers of GPUs for efficient
communication between them - these can at least be located anywhere in
the world. Inference is a lot less demanding as the GPUs don’t need to
collaborate in the same way, but it needs to be close to human
population centers to provide low latency responses.
</li>
<li>
NVIDIA are claiming huge efficiency gains. “Nvidia claims to have
delivered a 45,000 improvement in energy efficiency per token (a unit of
data processed by AI models) over the past eight years” - and that
“training a 1.8 trillion-parameter model using Blackwell GPUs, which
only required 4MW, versus 15MW using the previous Hopper architecture”.
</li>
<li>
Michael’s own global estimate is “45GW of additional demand by 2030”,
which he points out is “equivalent to one third of the power demand from
the world’s aluminum smelters”. But much of this demand needs to be
local, which makes things a lot more challenging, especially given the
need to integrate with the existing grid.
</li>
<li>
Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon all have net-zero emission targets
which they take very seriously, making them “some of the most
significant corporate purchasers of renewable energy in the world”. This
helps explain why they’re taking very real interest in nuclear power.
</li>
<li>
<p>
Elon’s 100,000-GPU data center in Memphis currently runs on gas:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
When Elon Musk rushed to get x.AI’s Memphis Supercluster up and running
in record time, he brought in 14 mobile
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/11/nx-s1-5088134/elon-musk-ai-xai-supercomputer-memphis-pollution">natural
gas-powered generators</a>, each of them generating 2.5MW. It seems they
do not require an air quality permit, as long as they do not remain in
the same location for more than 364 days.
</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Here’s a reassuring statistic: “91% of all new power capacity added
worldwide in 2023 was wind and solar”.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There’s so much more in there, I feel like I’m doing the article a
disservice by attempting to extract just the points above.
</p>
<p>
Michael’s conclusion is somewhat optimistic:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In the end, the tech titans will find out that the best way to power AI
data centers is in the traditional way, by building the same generating
technologies as are proving most cost effective for other users,
connecting them to a robust and resilient grid, and working with local
communities. […]
</p>
<p>
When it comes to new technologies – be it SMRs, fusion, novel renewables
or superconducting transmission lines – it is a blessing to have some
cash-rich, technologically advanced, risk-tolerant players creating
demand, which has for decades been missing in low-growth developed world
power markets.
</p>
