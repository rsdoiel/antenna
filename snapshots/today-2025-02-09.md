I now have turned Bluesky into a feed reader. This is new. Pretty sure it wasn&#39;t ever done on Twitter either. Here&#39;s the first one. It might be fun if this post turned up over there. It could (that part is somewhat random).

I subscribed to Wired yesterday. Their coverage of the Musk coup is unparalleled, and I am a Wired alum, having written for them in the early days of the web. It was only $10 for a year.

Recommend listening to the segment of this week&#39;s On The Media about what&#39;s going on at the DoJ. I know you don&#39;t need more to be depressed about, but something big is changing there, and you should know. Begins at 12:51.

## Minimizing the runtime of a SQL DAG

date: 2025-02-08, from: Max Halford Blog

<p>I recently looked into reducing the runtime of <a href="https://www.carbonfact.com/">Carbonfact</a>&rsquo;s SQL DAG. Our DAG is made up of roughly 160 SQL queries. It takes roughly 10 minutes to run, using BigQuery &ndash; with on-demand pricing. This is quite decent. However, the results of our DAG feed customer dashboards, and we have the (bad) habit of refreshing the DAG several times a day. Reducing the runtime by a few minutes can thus be a nice quality-of-life improvement.</p>
