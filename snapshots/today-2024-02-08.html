It’s not a bug in your RSS reader if recent articles in this feed all
suddenly appeared as unread. You may even have seeming duplicates.
</p>
<p>
Sorry about that! It’s due to my changing settings in my blog generator.
Pages now have a .html suffix where before they had none. This change
impacts permalinks, which also changes the <code>guid</code>s in my RSS
feed — and NetNewsWire and other RSS readers use the <code>guid</code>
property to identify articles, which means these will show up as new
articles.

<h2 id="jury-duty-is-self-government">Jury duty is self-government</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Jury duty is an intensive bootcamp for American democracy.
</p>
<p>
The great thing about jury duty is you get a very clear sense of what
self-government is about. It makes you feel empowered which can be even
more uncomfortable than feeling powerless.
</p>
<p>
So much of the frenetic activity online is about that sense of
powerlessness. So we give money to causes or we join in boycotts, but
these aren’t as powerful as participating in governing. Jury duty is a
very quick way to do that.
</p>
<p>
We have to act more like citizens and less like subjects. I think that’s
the real message of the election of 2016. Subjects elect someone like
Trump. People who think like citizens would elect someone very
different.

Go Up: Inside Crypto’s Wild Rise and Staggering Fall</i></a> is entitled
“Pig Butchering”. It starts when he receives a supposed wrong-number
text from a “Vicky”:<br />
<blockquote>
I showed my phone to my friend and explained that I was stringing Vicky
along because I’d heard about a new kind of investment fraud that often
started with a random text message. I had a hunch that this was why
“Vicky” was texting me. The scam was called “pig butchering” because the
scammers liked to build up the victim’s confidence with a pretend
romantic relationship and made-up investment gains before stealing all
their money in one fell swoop—like how hogs are fattened up before their
slaughter.
</blockquote>
This is a romance- and cryptocurrency-enabled version of the “Wee Forest

Faux strung “Vicky” along
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Number-Go-Up-Cryptos-Staggering-ebook/dp/B0BYV2Y3XT/ref=sr_1_1">and</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
My short-lived texting flirtation with Vicky confirmed something that I
had suspected: The scammers were using Tether to move the money. I spoke
with several other pig-butchering victims, and they said they’d been
asked to send Tether too.<br /> …<br /> From the scammer’s perspective,
Tether was a clear improvement on bribing bankers or money mules. It was
instant, there was no recourse for refunds, and it didn’t ask for
anyone’s name or address. And unlike other cryptocurrencies, its value
didn’t fluctuate from hour to hour, making it less scary for potential
victims and easier to manage for criminals.
</blockquote>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Number-Go-Up-Cryptos-Staggering-ebook/dp/B0BYV2Y3XT/ref=sr_1_1">How
much Tether are we talking?</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
News stories revealed that people were losing huge amounts of money. A
project finance lawyer in Boston with terminal cancer handed over $2.5
million. A divorced mother of three in St. Louis was defrauded of $5
million. A twenty-four-year-old social media producer in Tennessee lost
$300,000 she inherited from the sale of her childhood home.<br />
…<br /> I came across a group that claimed to be raising money dedicated
to helping victims. It was called the Global Anti-Scam Organization. The
group said it had helped a huge number of pig-butchering victims: 1,483
worldwide, who’d lost more than $250 million combined.
</blockquote>
Despite Tether’s ability to
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/what-happens-when-tether-freezes-your-tether-5a8ece2bd508">freeze
wallets</a>,
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Number-Go-Up-Cryptos-Staggering-ebook/dp/B0BYV2Y3XT/ref=sr_1_1">Faux
writes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Icetoad and other volunteers from the Global Anti-Scam group told me
that Tether refused to help them by freezing accounts or seizing stolen
money, even when presented with evidence that an account held the
proceeds of fraud.<br /> …<br /> In another exchange provided by Global
Anti-Scam, Tether told a Hong Kong police official that it did have the
ability to intervene. But the company still refused, saying the case was
too small. “We must sometimes decline fraud cases involving relatively
small amounts of stolen USDT,” the Tether representative wrote, using
the ticker symbol for the cryptocurrency. It said they would only
intervene if the case was “directly connected to acts of violence.”
</blockquote>
Faux got Rich Sanders of CipherBlade to trace his
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Number-Go-Up-Cryptos-Staggering-ebook/dp/B0BYV2Y3XT/ref=sr_1_1">payment
to “Vicky”</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
a small dark circle represented Vicky Ho’s wallet. This was where I’d
sent the eighty-one Tethers. Sanders explained that the wallet was
active for about two months and received many deposits from addresses
that were known to be associated with U.S. and Canadian Canadian crypto
exchanges. There were transfers of $3,600, $180, $400, $500, and $9,774,
always in Tether. These were other people who’d been scammed by the same
operation, Sanders said. In other words, I wasn’t Vicky’s only love
interest. Once Vicky Ho had collected the money, they sent it to another
numbered address, represented on the screen by a larger white circle.
This one was likely controlled by the scammers too, Sanders said, and it
held $9.4 million in Tethers. From there, many of the Tethers were sent
to addresses associated with the crypto exchange Binance, and to others
that belonged to Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX.
</blockquote>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Number-Go-Up-Cryptos-Staggering-ebook/dp/B0BYV2Y3XT/ref=sr_1_1">Global
Anti-Scam told Faux that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
most butchering scams were orchestrated by gangsters based in Cambodia
or Myanmar. These bosses would lure young men and women from across
Southeast Asia to move abroad with the promise of well-paying jobs in
customer service or online gambling. Then, when the workers arrived,
they’d be held captive and forced to work on online scams. Icetoad and
his colleagues told me there were thousands of people who’d been tricked
this way. Entire office towers were filled with floor after floor of
people forced to send spam messages around the clock, under threat of
torture or death. These were the people using Tether to move their
money.
</blockquote>
His next chapter recounts his trip to Cambodia to see the pig-butchering
campuses. Like the rest of the book, it is well worth reading.
Conditions in these campuses were
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-08-17/crypto-text-message-scams-lead-back-to-cambodia-slave-labor">horrific</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Workers who missed quotas were beaten, starved, made to hit one another.
One said he’d seen people forcibly injected with methamphetamine to
increase productivity. Two others said they’d seen workers murdered,
with the deaths passed off as suicides. They said the bosses would buy
and sell captive laborers like livestock.<br /> …<br /> Local news
reports described a string of suspicious deaths near Chinatown—one body
was found hanging at a construction site, and another corpse was dug up
handcuffed from a shallow grave in a field nearby. A local vendor told a
Cambodian outlet that there had been many suicides at the complex. “If
an ambulance doesn’t go inside at least twice a week, it is a wonder,”
he said.

Faux wasn’t alone in reporting on the pig-butchers. Poppy McPherson and
Tom Wilson of Reuters published a special report entitled
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/fintech-crypto-fraud-thailand/"><i>Crypto
scam: Inside the billion-dollar ’’pig-butchering‘‘ industry</i></a>.
They traced funds flowing to Wang Yicheng in Bangkok:<br />
<blockquote>
At a Thai police headquarters in October 2022, Chinese businessman Wang
Yicheng congratulated one of Bangkok’s most senior cybercrime
investigators on his recent promotion, presenting the official with a
large bouquet of flowers wrapped in red paper and a bow.<br /> <br />
Wang, the vice president of a local Chinese trade group, wished the new
cybercrime investigator “smooth work and new achievements,” according to
the group’s website, which displays photographs of the event.<br />
<br /> Over the past two years, Wang has forged relationships with
members of Thailand’s law-enforcement and political elite, the trade
group’s online posts show. During that time, a cryptocurrency account
registered in Wang’s name was receiving millions of dollars linked to a
type of cryptocurrency investment scam known as pig butchering, a
Reuters investigation has found.<br /> <br /> In total, crypto worth
more than $90 million flowed into the account between January 2021 and
November 2022, according to registration documents and transaction logs
reviewed by Reuters. Of that, at least $9.1 million came from a crypto
wallet that U.S. blockchain analysis firm TRM Labs said was linked to
pig-butchering scams. Two other major crypto-tracking firms also said
the account received funds linked to such scams.<br /> …<br /> Lisa
Wolk, a blockchain intelligence analyst at TRM, said the crypto account
in Wang’s name “is a node in a money laundering network and not
necessarily the ultimate recipient of funds.” Reuters was unable to
determine whether anyone else benefited from the account or used Wang’s
identity to open it.<br />
</blockquote>
Where was
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/fintech-crypto-fraud-thailand/">Wang’s
account?</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The crypto account registered to Wang was held at Binance, the world’s
largest crypto exchange, according to three blockchain analysis firms.
Asked about the account, Binance spokesperson Jessica Jung declined to
comment on individual users or Reuters’ findings. In an August post on
its website, the company said the number of reports of pig-butchering
scams it had received this year was double that of 2022, an increase it
attributed to an influx of inexperienced crypto investors and scammers
looking to exploit them.<br /> …<br /> In April, the U.S. Department of
Justice said it seized about $112 million worth of crypto linked to
pig-butchering scams, without identifying suspects. A warrant that
resulted in the seizure of more than half that amount specified a
Binance account registered in Thailand.<br />
</blockquote>
Wang’s account moved a
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/fintech-crypto-fraud-thailand/">lot
of Tether</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The crypto account in Wang’s name was registered in November 2020,
according to the financial records Reuters reviewed. The three
blockchain-analysis firms determined the account was with Binance. The
documents, which relate to the Binance account, span two years to
November 2022. They show that the account was accessed mostly from
Bangkok.<br /> <br /> Deposits started arriving in the account in early
2021 and quickly increased in size to include sums of more than
$100,000, the financial records show.<br /> …<br /> In 2022, the volume
of crypto reaching the account in Wang’s name mushroomed to almost $79
million, a near six-fold increase on the previous year, the account
records seen by Reuters show.<br /> <br /> Coinfirm, the blockchain
analysis firm that reviewed the transaction records for Reuters, said
deposits from funds linked to pig-butchering scams it previously
investigated began entering the account as early as February 2022.
Stolen crypto was moved to the account via a “complex layering scheme,”
involving multiple different wallets, Coinfirm’s then-head of fraud
investigations Roman Bieda told Reuters in May. The crypto moved between
“dozens” of wallets and was mixed with funds from other sources, he
said.<br /> <br /> More than $102,000 originating from fraudsters’
wallets that the California man identified were deposited into the
account in Wang’s name between June 26 and Oct. 23, 2022, according to
Coinfirm.<br /> <br /> Nearly all of the crypto deposited in the
Wang-registered account was moved to other wallets, the transaction
records reviewed by Reuters show. Between January 2021 and October 2022,
about $87.5 million was transferred to almost 50 other crypto wallets,
including at least five registered at regionally based crypto exchanges,
Coinfirm said.
</blockquote>
The pigs weren’t
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/fintech-crypto-fraud-thailand/">butchered
in Bangkok</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Several scams connected to deposits made into the account in Wang’s name
were run from an industrial park on the Myanmar-Thai border, one of the
blockchain analysis firms told Reuters. Workers are trafficked to the
area, known as KK Park, by gangs that force them to con people online,
according to two former workers and groups that support workers or scam
victims.<br />
</blockquote>
This was clearly a different pig abattoir from the Cambodia-based one
Faux investigated.<br /> <br /> A more detailed account of tracing the
money flows of the pig butchers can be found in
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4687064"><i>Connecting Chinese
and American Scam Victims</i></a>, a collaboration betwween Jonathan
Reiter’s company ChainArgos and BitTrace, a Chinese blockchain tracing
company. The abstract reads:
<blockquote>
The world is experiencing an epidemic of online scams with at least tens
of billions of dollars lost across dozens of countries. One particular
class of scam known as “pig butchering” has grown dramatically and often
involves the use of cryptocurrency both to collect funds from victims
and to launder the proceeds. Here we are going to explore the use of
cryptocurrency in pig butchering scams beginning with victims in both
the People’s Republic of China and United States of America, and
demonstrating the remarkable degree of similarity for cases that have no
reason <i>a priori</i> to be similar at all.<br /> <br /> Specifically
we will show that scammers with victims in both these countries share
cryptocur- rency addresses, use overlapping sets of money-laundering
services, and are therefore likely parts of the same group or syndicate.
Our analysis begins with reports from victims in both countries where we
find source victim and scam wallet addresses. From there we are able to
trace scam proceeds through the cryptocurrency ecosystem to prove these
connections. Finally, a range of exchanges and other service providers
are identified through a combination of on-chain and documentary
research, to demonstrate the cross-border nature of modern scams
leveraging cryptocurrencies, and highlight the challenges facing law
enforcement agencies globally when it comes to such scams.
</blockquote>
The two teams use press accounts of two cases with victims in China and
legal filings from two cases with victims in Florida and California.
They provide detailed traces, including wallet addresses, of flows from
the victims to exchanges including Binance, Bitkub, FTX, OKX, Coinbase,
Huboi, Maskex, Paribu and Peatio amounting to $635M. In particular, one
of the Binance wallets was one of those identified in Reuters’
reporting. The paper
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4687064">concludes</a>:
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
Similar simultaneously-run scams have victims in both China and the
United States.
</li>
<li>
Funds taken from both jurisdictions flow through common service
providers.
</li>
<li>
The sums involved range from the tens to possibly hundreds of millions
of dollars.
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
The ChainArgos team followed up with
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/laundering-the-proceeds-of-crime-cryptos-killer-app-02686113ff66"><i>Laundering
the Proceeds of Crime: Crypto’s Killer App?</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Now we are going to connect a few more dots to argue that scamming and
the laundering of scam proceeds was not just a use case for
cryptocurrencies in Asia, but likely a major driver of flows through
several well-known industry players.<br /> <br /> This may well even be,
empirically, crypto’s killer app.
</blockquote>
They note that
<a href="https://protos.com/genesis-block-ftx-had-more-than-prostitutes-in-thailand/">Genesis
Block</a>, whose
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKeMfxLV8K8">Charles Yang
admitted</a> maintaining bank accounts in South-East Asia under false
pretences, appears to have been the
<a href="https://www.dirtybubblemedia.com/p/blockchain-evidence-suggests-genesis">on-
and off-ramp for FTX</a> in the region. The
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4687064">earlier paper</a>
showed
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/laundering-the-proceeds-of-crime-cryptos-killer-app-02686113ff66">that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
FTX was involved in processing over US$250 million in flows downstream
from scams and Bitkub, Thailand’s largest crypto exchange, was involved
in over US$100 million.
</blockquote>
Could this be
“<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/laundering-the-proceeds-of-crime-cryptos-killer-app-02686113ff66">banking
Cambodia’s unbanked</a>”?:<br />
<blockquote>
Cambodia’s population is only 16 million, with a per capita GDP of about
US$1,600 — it’s hard to imagine Cambodia driving hundreds of millions of
dollars worth of stablecoin flows.
</blockquote>
They refer to the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKeMfxLV8K8">interview with
Charles Yang</a> and
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/laundering-the-proceeds-of-crime-cryptos-killer-app-02686113ff66">note
that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Genesis Block’s head trader explicitly talks about scam proceeds leading
to bank account freezes and how they actively manage this problem.<br />
<br /> So Genesis Block were clearly a downstream service provider and
knew that at least some of their clients were, or at least were dealing
with, criminals.<br /> <br /> With regards to Genesis Block’s Chinese
client base, in a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l86eSpiUbKw">different
interview</a> the same person says:<br />
<blockquote>
<i> We’ve been seeing a lot of our partners pretty much disappear…a lot
of our friends over there are kind of in big trouble…it’s not really
about crypto it’s more about the source of the RMB… [which was] a lot of
pyramid schemes, a lot of scams. </i>
</blockquote>
Genesis Block were clearly dealing with people who were either criminals
themselves, or service providers to criminals, and Genesis Block
appeared comfortable talking about such activities on camera.
</blockquote>
Genesis Block was
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/laundering-the-proceeds-of-crime-cryptos-killer-app-02686113ff66">plugged
in to the top level of cryptocurrency infrastructure</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Genesis Block OTC was on the
<a href="https://www.dirtybubblemedia.com/p/a-walled-garden-full-of-snakes-the">Signet
client list</a>, as were many of the other exchanges referenced in our
earlier work.<br /> <br /> A service provider that talked openly about
dealing with criminals was active on a platform another commentator
described as
“<a href="https://www.dirtybubblemedia.com/p/a-walled-garden-full-of-snakes-the">a
walled garden filled with snakes</a>.”<br /> <br /> That service
provider (Genesis Block) was integrated with FTX/Alameda Research),
which was both the
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/usdt-on-tron-ftx-wtf-is-really-happening-ef0cb807019a">largest
recipient of new USDT</a> and a major exchange operator with
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/02/technology/sam-bankman-fried-fraud-trial-ftx.html">myriad,
sometimes-remarkably-creative, schemes to access fiat currency</a>.
</blockquote>
This leads ChainArgos to
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/laundering-the-proceeds-of-crime-cryptos-killer-app-02686113ff66">argue
that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
it is entirely plausible that:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Genesis Block’s client base included many of these scammers and/or
crimionals;
</li>
<li>
the outsized involvement of FTX was this flow; and/or
</li>
<li>
so was the Bitkub flow, via Genesis Block or otherwise;
</li>
</ul>
and this isn’t just plausible, it’s provable, because the illicit flows
documented in our prior work were laundered by someone.<br /> <br /> If
it wasn’t this route it means there is at least one more
multi-billion-dollar laundering pipeline connected to this activity we
know nothing about.<br /> <br /> That is possible of course, but seems
unlikely.<br /> <br /> Certainly the simplest explanation is that no
second as-yet-undiscovered group of scammers or criminals exists and
it’s all the same organization.<br /> <br /> Now remember these actors
specifically mentioned that the traditional financial system was
blocking them and freezing their accounts.
</blockquote>
Thus ChainArgos
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/laundering-the-proceeds-of-crime-cryptos-killer-app-02686113ff66">concludes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
We are looking at a gigantic amount of bad flow that was caught by banks
and how cryptocurrencies were used to circumvent those controls.<br />
<br /> The contents of those frozen accounts could have been, and at
least partially would have been, sent back to the victims instead of
being irreversibly exfiltrated.<br /> <br /> So this may well be
crypto’s real killer app — irreversible cross-border transfers for
criminals.
</blockquote>
Taken together, what these documents show is lives being wrecked, both
by the scams themselves leading to suicides, and by the human trafficing
that provides the scammers workforce, leading to beatings, imprisonment
and suicides. Pillars of the cryptocurrency community are enabling
this:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Tether, which refused to freeze wallets despite detailed blockchain
evidence of pig-butchering even from law enforcement. Contrast this with
Tether’s behavior in the case of
<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/what-happens-when-tether-freezes-your-tether-5a8ece2bd508">The
Victim</a> documented by Patrick Tan, where a simple request from law
enforcement with only suspicion froze a wallet.
</li>
<li>
Major exchanges, including Binance, FTX, Huboi and many others, were on
notice that they were handling funds from the pig butchers. Take Binance
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/fintech-crypto-fraud-thailand/">for
example</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Binance publicly said it assisted Thai police with a probe into “a
significant pig butchering scam,” and that about $277 million of assets
were confiscated.
</blockquote>
and they
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/fintech-crypto-fraud-thailand/">blamed
the victims</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
the number of reports of pig-butchering scams it had received this year
was double that of 2022, an increase it attributed to an influx of
inexperienced crypto investors and scammers looking to exploit them.
</blockquote>
and they responded to a
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/fintech-crypto-fraud-thailand/">Dept.
of Justice warrant</a> about these funds.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus these businesses cannnot claim ignorance of the flow of
pig-butchering funds, or of their scale. But they are clearly motivated
to turn a blind eye to them whenever possible.<br /> <br /></p>

It was more of a speed hike. 😅

its video game era</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
Disney announced it will take a $1.5 billion stake in Epic Games — the
creator of popular game platform Fortnite — in an effort to diversify
while its linear media struggles. The partnership means we can expect
Epic-created games featuring Disney characters in the not-too-distant
future. Plus, Federal Reserve higher-ups signal they will take their
time on rate cuts and U.S. imports of Chinese goods fell last year.

from February 2023 through January 2024, the average global temperature

nations adopted the legally binding Paris Agreement with the long-term
goal of limiting the global temperature increase to well below 2 degrees
Celsius, and ideally below 1.5 degrees. A one-year breach doesn’t mean
the target is bust, because it “refers to long-term warming – the IPCC

short-term influence of natural fluctuations in the climate, such as El

air pollution rules</a> yesterday, cracking down on dangerous

concentrations of particulate matter was 12 micrograms per cubic meter
(µg/m3). Based on epidemiological research showing that this standard
did not adequately protect public health, the agency has now lowered the
standard to 9 µg/m3. The rules are expected to prevent 4,500 premature
deaths per year by 2032. The EPA also updated its Air Quality Index in
conjunction with the new rules, which could mean that even as the air
gets cleaner, you might get more air quality alerts,

<li>Monarch butterfly numbers drop sharply
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>Heat, drought, and pesticides and herbicides are taking
a toll on the monarch butterfly population. Numbers of the iconic orange
butterflies in Mexico, where they spend the winter, fell by 59% this
year to their second lowest level ever recorded, <em>The Associated
Press
</em><a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=5f40c1dc34&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.
Extreme weather, logging, and chemical treatments are all hurting the
insects’ natural habitat and killing the milkweed plant on which they
lay their eggs. “It has a lot to do with climate change,” said Gloria
Tavera, director of Mexico’s Commission for National Protected Areas.
The monarchs’ migration path is the longest of any insect species known
to science: They winter in Mexico and then head north to Canada. No
single butterfly survives the entire trek; instead their offspring
finish it for them, before turning around and heading back to Mexico to
start the process over again.

Matthew Zeitlin reported</a>: Orsted had 9.6 billion Danish kroner worth
of fees (about $1.4 billion) related to one New Jersey project, Ocean
Wind 1, and had booked $4 billion of losses, most of which were due to
Ocean Wind 1’s cancellation. Overall, it reported a loss of almost $3
billion in 2023. Orsted also said it was pulling out of Norway, Spain,
and Portugal. In a call with analysts, the company’s chief executive
Mads Nipper said that Orsted will spend far less money on projects

<strong></strong>Convincing people to change their habits and beliefs is
very hard, but when it comes to the climate crisis, widespread
behavioral shifts are essential. A new “global megastudy” of more than
59,000 participants across 63 countries attempted to figure out which
“interventions” can be most effective at shifting beliefs and getting
people to support climate policy. The results,

in <em>Science Advances</em></a>, show that the act of writing a letter
to future generations was “one of the top interventions tested.”
Participants had to pen a note to a hypothetical child who will be
turning 30 in the year 2055, detailing what they’re doing now to help
keep the planet healthy. This exercise was the most effective
intervention at nudging people toward supporting climate mitigation
policies.

<h2 id="on-software-liabilities">On Software Liabilities</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, updated: 2024-02-07, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Over on Lawfare, Jim Dempsey published a really interesting
<a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/standards-for-software-liability-focus-on-the-product-for-liability-focus-on-the-process-for-safe-harbor">proposal</a>
for software liability: “Standard for Software Liability: Focus on the
Product for Liability, Focus on the Process for Safe Harbor.”
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Section 1 of this paper sets the stage by briefly describing the problem
to be solved. Section 2 canvasses the different fields of law (warranty,
negligence, products liability, and certification) that could provide a
starting point for what would have to be legislative action establishing
a system of software liability. The conclusion is that all of these
fields would face the same question: How buggy is too buggy? Section 3
explains why existing software development frameworks do not provide a
sufficiently definitive basis for legal liability. They focus on
process, while a liability regime should begin with a focus on the
product—­that is, on outcomes. Expanding on the idea of building codes
for building code, Section 4 shows some examples of product-focused
standards from other fields. Section 5 notes that already there have
been definitive expressions of software defects that can be drawn
together to form the minimum legal standard of security. It specifically
calls out the list of common software weaknesses tracked by the MITRE
Corporation under a government contract. Section 6 considers how to
define flaws above the minimum floor and how to limit that liability
with a safe harbor…

<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
For the past few days, Southern Californians have found themselves
living with a kind of weather one doesn’t typically associate with the
region: rain. Days of rain. The kind of rain that, in the worst cases,
causes flooding and landslides, and in the best cases enforces a kind of
unwilling solitude. (A friend in the Los Angeles area recently sent me a
video of her German Shepherd, yowling discontentedly at the falling
water.) One gauge at the University of California, Los Angeles recorded
<a href="https://twitter.com/MatthewCappucci/status/1754756623816687989" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more
than a foot</a> of rain in 24 hours, making it what the National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration calls a “thousand-year”
rainfall event.
</p>
<p>
The cause is a slow-moving atmospheric river that has essentially parked
itself over the region. And yet, even with all that rain, California
<a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2023/1/6/23542194/california-atmospheric-river-flood-drought" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">still
won’t</a> be able to escape the drought that’s gripped the West for
years. California, it turns out, might be a bit <em>too </em>good at
flood control.
</p>
<p>
Undeveloped floodplains act like natural speed bumps for fast-moving
floods — the water spreads out over the plain, slows down, and
eventually seeps into the dirt to become groundwater. But land is at a
premium in Southern California, especially in the L.A. area, and for
decades the prevailing wisdom was to contain rivers with concrete so
they wouldn’t flood, opening the floodplains to housing development.
What we still call the L.A. River is now, essentially, a concrete drain.
</p>
<p>
This creates two problems. First, there’s no natural barrier that can
slow down flood waters during events like this week’s storms. And
second, there’s nowhere for that water to go other than into the rivers
and out to sea.
</p>
<p>
“Most of the rivers in Southern California are channelized, or
concrete-lined, and most of the floodplains are developed,”
<a href="https://search.asu.edu/profile/4522298" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jay
Famiglietti</a>, a hydrologist at Arizona State University’s Global
Futures Lab and a former member of the California State Water Board in
Santa Ana and Los Angeles, told me. “When we built all that
infrastructure, we really were thinking more about flooding and not
thinking about saving that water.”
</p>
<p>
That’s because California has historically been pretty well-supplied
with water from the Colorado River and Sierra Nevada snowpack that would
melt in the spring and summer, delivering water through mountain
streams. But as Ian James wrote in the <em>Los Angeles Times </em>last
week, California is in
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-01-31/amid-storms-california-snowpack-remains-far-below-average" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
“snow drought,”</a> with about only about half the historical average
snowpack for this point in the season. While the storms might help shore
up the Sierra Nevada snowpack a bit, it still won’t be enough.
</p>
<p>
Warmer air carries more water, but it also means that less snow falls at
lower elevations than before — where once we might have seen a few
inches of snow, we now see a few inches of rain. During an atmospheric
river in particular, so much water is dumped over such a short time
period that protecting people from flooding becomes the primary concern.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a difficult balance between protecting people against flooding,
which I think we do a really good job at, and replenishing groundwater,”
Famiglietti said. But, he told me, Californians need to start having
some difficult conversations about the possibility of moving people off
the floodplains — what planners called “managed retreat” — and returning
riverbanks to their natural state so that floodwaters can spread out
into the plains, slow down, and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/so-how-do-you-actually-refill-an-aquifer" target="_self">refill
aquifers</a> that the state can rely on throughout the year.
</p>
<p>
Managed retreat is a difficult topic — nobody ever wants to leave their
home. And then there’s the problem of money; local, state, and federal
government agencies would probably have to fund all those moves and the
subsequent restoration of the rivers and floodplains. “We need to be
spending a lot more money,” Famiglietti told me. “We’re talking
trillions of dollars. And who pays for it, the federal government or the
state? I don’t have the answer.”
</p>
<p>
There <em>are</em> some plans to reshape the L.A. River,
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2021-01-11/frank-gehry-plan-los-angeles-river" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spearheaded
by none other than Frank Gehry</a> — but Famiglietti says that instead
of restoring the river’s banks and opening up floodplains, the plans
call for even more development. A coalition of environmental groups
opposes the plan, saying Gehry’s idea, which includes the construction
of “platform parks” that would span over the canal, saying that it
“stands to do particular ecological harm, create real estate
speculation, and precludes future opportunities for climate resilience.”
</p>
<p>
Going in the opposite direction — less development and less concrete —
is sort of antithetical to our ideas of progress. But the atmospheric
rivers will keep coming, Famiglietti stressed, and it’s difficult to
plan a city around unpredictable rain events.
</p>
<p>
“We did the right thing at the time [when we built flood
infrastructure],” Famiglietti told me. “But now, in a sense, we have to
be thinking about moving backwards.”

id="iraq-criticizes-us-strikes-after-baghdad-attack-killed-iran-backed-militant-group-commander">Iraq
Criticizes US Strikes After Baghdad Attack Killed Iran-Backed Militant
Group Commander</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Pentagon — Iraq Thursday sharply criticized a U.S. drone strike that
the U.S. military said killed a leader of an Iranian-backed militant
group, with an Iraqi spokesman calling the attack “a blatant
assassination” that showed “no regard for civilian lives or
international laws.”</p>
<p>Yehia Rasool, a spokesman for the Iraqi prime minister, said the
U.S.-led coalition that has operated in Iraq to counter the Islamic
State group “consistently deviates from the reasons and objectives for
its presence on our territory.”</p>
<p>“The trajectory compels the Iraqi government more than ever to
terminate the mission of this coalition, which has become a factor for
instability and threatens to entangle Iraq in the cycle of conflict,”
Rasool said in a statement.</p>
<p>U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in the
Middle East, said the strike on Tuesday killed a commander of the
militant group Kataib Hezbollah who was “responsible for directly
planning and participating in attacks on U.S. forces in the region.”</p>
<p>Two U.S. officials confirmed to VOA that the commander was operations
officer Wisam Mohammad al-Saedi. Photos on social media allegedly showed
his Iraqi identification card that was pulled from his body.</p>
<p>VOA had earlier reported the U.S. military was involved in an
airstrike against a high-value target in the Middle East but had not
identified al-Saedi by name.</p>
<p>Video shared on social media shows a vehicle engulfed in flames on a
Baghdad highway.</p>
<p>The U.S. strike was in response to the almost 170 drone, rocket and
missile attacks against U.S. forces in the Middle East since
mid-October, one of which killed three U.S. service members and wounded
dozens more in northern Jordan last week.</p>
<p>A wave of U.S. airstrikes in Iraq and Syria on Friday pounded targets
associated with Iranian-backed militias responsible for the attacks. The
strikes targeted three locations in Iraq, as well as another four in
Syria, and they destroyed more than 80 individual targets, ranging from
command-and-control centers and intelligence hubs to missile and drone
storage facilities, according to the latest U.S. assessments.</p>
<p>But while U.S. officials have defended the strikes as necessary
following a drone attack that killed three U.S. soldiers at a base in
Jordan last month, Iraqi officials have voiced increased anger,
summoning the U.S. chargé d’affaires in Baghdad to protest. They have
charged that some of the U.S. strikes hit elements of Iraq’s own
security forces.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department said Monday that Iraq was not given any
warning but added the U.S. strikes should not have come as a
surprise.</p>
<p>Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder said Monday the U.S.
had no plans for a long-term military campaign against the militias in
Iraq and Syria, but he noted the U.S. response to the killing of its
service members was “not complete.”</p>
<p>The U.S. has about 2,500 troops in Iraq tasked with advising and
assisting Iraqi security forces as they pursue the remnants of the
Islamic State terror group, also known as ISIS or Daesh.</p>
<p>And while talks between the U.S. and Iraq are under way to eventually
reduce the U.S. military footprint and transition from the counter-IS
mission to what officials describe as more traditional
military-to-military relationship with Baghdad, the process has been
complicated by the attacks.</p>
<p>The United States has also been carrying out strikes in response to
attacks by Iran-backed Houthi militants in Yemen who have threatened key
Red Sea shipping lanes.</p>
<p>U.S. Central Command, which overseas U.S. forces in the region, said
Thursday it conducted two separate strikes late Wednesday against Houthi
cruise missiles that were prepared to launch.</p>
<p>A CENTCOM statement said the missiles “presented an imminent threat
to U.S. Navy ships and merchant vessels in the region.”</p>
<p>The Houthis have said their Red Sea attacks are in solidarity with
the people of Gaza and have vowed to continue them.</p>

Heads Home Without Israeli-Hamas Cease-Fire or Hostage Release</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. State Department  — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken
returned to Washington from the Middle East on Thursday with no new deal
in hand for a cease-fire in the four-month Israel-Hamas war in Gaza or
release of any more hostages held by the militants.</p>
<p>Blinken and other U.S. officials said they remained optimistic a halt
in the fighting can be achieved and 100 or so remaining hostages freed.
But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu derided a Hamas plan that
would leave the militants in control of the Gaza Strip as “delusional”
and said Israeli forces would fight to win “absolute victory.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the White House announced that President Joe Biden would
host Jordan’s King Abdullah II in Washington on Monday for talks on
resolving the Israel-Hamas conflict.</p>
<p>Blinken wrapped up a four-nation Mideast trip by meeting with
Netanyahu’s war cabinet, including former military chiefs Benny Gantz
and Gabi Eisenkot. The top U.S. diplomat said he would focus on “the
hostages and the strong desire that we both have to see them returned to
their families, the work that’s being done to that end.”</p>
<p>But late Wednesday, Blinken acknowledged sharp differences between a
cease-fire plan offered by Israel, the U.S., Qatar and Egypt that would
last several weeks and free hostages and Hamas’ response calling for an
Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza, an end to its bombardment of Gaza
and the right for Hamas to govern the territory and rebuild its military
capability.</p>
<p>“Clearly there are things that Hamas sent back that are absolute
non-starters,” Blinken said at a news conference. “But, at the same
time, we see space to continue to pursue an agreement.”</p>
<p>“And these things are always negotiations,” he said. “It’s not
flipping a light switch. It’s not ‘yes’ or ‘no.’ There’s invariably back
and forth.”</p>
<p>A senior Hamas official said a Hamas delegation was in Cairo on
Thursday to continue negotiations with Egyptian and Qatari
officials. </p>
<p>The United States has been Israel’s staunchest ally in its fight
against Hamas following the militants’ shock October 7 attack on Israel
that killed 1,200 people. But Netanyahu was dismissive of Blinken’s
assessment that the Hamas’ plan could at least serve as a starting point
for cease-fire discussions.</p>
<p>“We are on the way to an absolute victory. There is no other
solution,” Netanyahu said at a news conference after meeting with
Blinken. He said Israel’s war effort would take months, not years. </p>
<p>The Israeli leader also appeared to dismiss concerns from the U.S.
and others about expanding Israel’s military operations in southern
Gaza, particularly in Rafah on the Egyptian border, where more than a
million Palestinians have fled at Israel’s demand to escape fighting
further to the north.</p>
<p>Blinken said, “On all of my previous visits here and pretty much
every day in between, we have pressed Israel in concrete ways to
strengthen civilian protection, to get more assistance to those who need
it. And over the past four months, Israel has taken important steps to
do just that,” he said. “And yet … the daily toll that its military
operations continue to take on innocent civilians remains too high.”</p>
<p>In rejecting the Hamas cease-fire plan, Netanyahu also called for the
dismantlement of the United Nations relief agency for Palestinians, the
main distributor of international humanitarian assistance in Gaza, after
allegations that a dozen of its employees took part in the Hamas October
attack. </p>
<p>Blinken appealed to Netanyahu and other Israelis not to let vengeance
dictate their continued response.</p>
<p>“Israelis were dehumanized in the most horrific way on October 7,” he
said. “And the hostages have been dehumanized every day since. But that
cannot be a license to dehumanize others.”  </p>
<p>The Hamas-controlled Gaza health ministry says Israel’s
counter-offensive has killed more than 27,500 people and displaced about
2 million Palestinians in Gaza from their homes. </p>
<p>In its proposal, Hamas called for three 45-day phases, first
releasing all remaining women and children, as well as older and sick
men, in exchange for an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners held
by Israel. </p>
<p>The Hamas plan calls for Israel to withdraw from populated areas and
end its aerial bombardment while also allowing far more humanitarian aid
to enter Gaza and permitting Palestinians to return to their homes,
including in devastated northern Gaza. </p>
<p>The second phase, to be negotiated during the first, would include
the release of all remaining hostages, mostly soldiers, in exchange for
all Palestinian detainees over the age of 50, including senior
militants, to be freed by Israel.</p>
<p>Israel would release an additional 1,500 prisoners, 500 of whom would
be specified by Hamas, and complete its withdrawal from Gaza. </p>
<p>In the third phase, the sides would exchange the remains of hostages
and prisoners. Israel says it believes more than two dozen of the
remaining 130 or so hostages in Gaza have already died or been
killed. </p>
<p>Blinken’s trip to the Mideast was his fifth since the war
started.</p>
<p>He has reiterated the U.S, stance that creation of a Palestinian
state is the best way to ensure lasting peace and security for Israelis
and Palestinians alike, and greater integration for the region.
According to the State Department, Blinken also emphasized the urgent
need to lower tensions in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and prevent the
conflict from expanding. </p>
<p>Critics have attacked Netanyahu for having no definitive plan for
governing Gaza after the war ends. </p>
<p>He said Wednesday, “The day after is the day after Hamas. All of
Hamas.”</p>
<p>Netanyahu has rejected any arrangement that would leave Hamas in full
or partial control of Gaza. He also said Israel is the “only power”
capable of guaranteeing security in the long term.</p>

<h2 id="china-linked-hackers-lurk-in-critical-us-systems">China-Linked
Hackers Lurk in Critical US Systems</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — China-linked hackers targeting key sectors of the U.S.
economy appear to have been hiding in key computer systems and networks
for at least five years, according to a new warning from the United
States and key allies, who urge companies to take urgent action to
mitigate the risk. </p>
<p>The cybersecurity advisory issued Wednesday by multiple U.S.
agencies, including the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency (CISA), states that a cyberthreat group known as Volt
Typhoon has been “positioning itself to launch destructive cyberattacks
that would jeopardize the physical safety of Americans.” </p>
<p>In particular, the advisory warns that China-linked Volt Typhoon
hackers have successfully infiltrated the computer networks of private
companies linked to critical sectors of the U.S. economy, including
communications, energy, water and wastewater, and transportation. </p>
<p>The advisory further warns that Volt Typhoon hackers have been
“maintaining access and footholds within some victim IT environments for
at least five years.” And CISA acknowledged the penetrations may be more
extensive than is currently known. </p>
<p>Officials said other industries, including construction, information
technology and education are also being targeted. </p>
<p>“What we’ve found to date is likely the tip of the iceberg,” CISA
Director Jen Easterly said in a statement. “CISA teams have found and
eradicated Volt Typhoon intrusions into critical infrastructure across
multiple sectors.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition to the FBI and CISA, the advisory — and its findings —
were endorsed by the U.S. National Security Agency, as well as cyber
officials from Canada, Australia and New Zealand, who said that their
own critical infrastructure could also be at risk. </p>
<p>One CISA official called the advisory “a stark warning to critical
infrastructure organizations.” </p>
<p>“The information that we are releasing with this advisory is
reflecting a strategic shift in PRC [People’s Republic of China]
malicious cyber activity from a focus on espionage and IT theft,” said
Eric Goldstein, CISA executive assistant director for
cybersecurity. </p>
<p>“Our evidence strongly suggests that these PRC actors are positioning
to launch future disruptive or destructive cyberattacks that could cause
impact to national security, economic security or public health and
safety,” he told reporters, adding he expects the number of victims to
grow. </p>
<p>Goldstein and other U.S. officials said that so far, there are no
indications that hackers with Volt Typhoon have attempted to launch any
sort of disruptive attacks on critical infrastructure. But they also
said the way the Chinese-linked cyber actors infiltrated critical
networks means it is likely just a matter of time. </p>
<p>“This stealthy access increases our concern that they are lurking,
waiting for the right moment to cause devastating impacts,” said FBI
Deputy Assistant Director Cynthia Kaiser.  </p>
<p>Kaiser also warned that Volt Typhoon “is certainly not the only
Chinese group conducting this type of activity.” </p>
<p>She said the FBI has identified additional threats by using
surveillance capabilities authorized under Section 702 of the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, a controversial law that allows
the FBI and U.S. intelligence agencies to gather electronic data of
non-Americans without first obtaining a warrant.</p>
<p>“In fact, we only know about many critical infrastructure entities
compromised by the Chinese because of FBI FISA 702 collection,” she
said.</p>
<p>The latest warning comes just a week after top U.S. law enforcement
and cyber officials told lawmakers that they are bracing for a “cyber
onslaught” from China. </p>
<p>“The risk that poses to every American requires our attention — now,”
FBI Director Christopher Wray told the Select Committee on the Chinese
Communist Party last Wednesday. “China’s hackers are positioning on
American infrastructure in preparation to wreak havoc and cause
real-world harm to American citizens and communities, if or when China
decides the time has come to strike.” </p>
<p>China has repeatedly denied such allegations. </p>
<p>“The Chinese government has been categorical in opposing hacking
attacks and the abuse of information technology,” Liu Pengyu,
spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA via email
after last week’s hearing. “We urge the U.S. side to stop making
irresponsible criticism against other countries on the issue of
cyber-security.”</p>
<p>But officials in Washington have been steadfast in their warnings,
saying they believe Beijing would have few reservations about carrying
out an attack on U.S. critical infrastructure in the event of a
conflict. </p>
<p>Specifically, they cite the possibility of such attacks in the event
China decides to invade Taiwan as a way to damage Washington’s ability
to provide military assistance. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The just-released U.S. cybersecurity advisory urges companies to fix
security vulnerabilities that could allow hackers, like those with Volt
Typhoon, to infiltrate and hide — a tactic known as “living off the
land.” </p>
<p>It also encourages companies to search their systems in case hackers
have already broken through. </p>
<p>But officials admit there are significant challenges, pointing to a
just-disrupted Volt Typhoon malware campaign, which targeted common
computer routers used by homes and small businesses across the United
States to access critical infrastructure. </p>
<p>“These devices were no longer patched by the manufacturers, making
them vulnerable,” said the FBI’s Kaiser. “That’s why the FBI recommends
that network owners remove and replace any end-of-life devices to
minimize the risk of the device being compromised again by Volt Typhoon
or other malicious cyber actors.”</p>

id="stars-athletes-plan-to-flock-las-vegas-for-super-bowl-events">Stars,
Athletes Plan to Flock Las Vegas for Super Bowl Events</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Las Vegas will be flooded with so many pre- Super Bowl
events that Shaquille O’Neal lowered the prices to his popular
carnival-themed “Shaq’s Fun House.”</p>
<p>Instead of raising the rate, O’Neal decided to offer potential
attendees more bang for their buck to the NBA legend’s sixth annual
event planned for Friday in Sin City. He made the decision to lower the
rates after purchasing an expensive suite at the Formula One that cost
nearly five times more than normal to watch the racing event in Las
Vegas last year.</p>
<p>“We’re not going to do that to the people,” said O’Neal, who said the
going rate for Fun House starts at $99 but will increase as the event
nears. He’ll bring back Lil Wayne, Diplo and himself under his name DJ
Diesel to perform during his over-the-top festival — which features
several attractions including a Ferris wheel, circus performers and
premium bar.</p>
<p>“We could’ve done $200, $250 or $300,” said O’Neal whose event will
take place XS Nightclub at the Wynn — a hotel that will host Rob
Gronkowski ’s Gronk Beach in Encore on Saturday afternoon and Sports
Illustrated’s The Party in XS Nightclub later that night. “But I don’t
like taking advantage of people. We want to have the best party with the
best rides, performers and just hanging out.”</p>
<p>Along with O’Neal’s event, the days leading up to the Super Bowl
between the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers will include
concerts from some of the biggest stars including Travis Scott, Green
Day, Killer Mike, Kelly Clarkson, Ice Spice, Future and David Guetta.
The week will include some comedy too.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at some of the invite-only and public events during a
busy Super Bowl week:</p>
<p>Fanatics Party</p>
<p>Michael Rubin is known for his exclusive summer bashes in the
Hamptons — which bring out stars like Beyoncé, Jay-Z, Leonardo DiCaprio,
Jennifer Lopez, Ben Affleck and Kendall Jenner.</p>
<p>Now, Rubin, the founder and CEO of Fanatics, will host his
invite-only daytime event at Marquee Dayclub at the Cosmopolitan the day
before the Super Bowl. His event will feature performances by Travis
Scott, The Chainsmokers, Ice Spice, A$AP Ferg, Meek Mill, Lil Baby,
Fabolous, Ludacris, Ne-Yo and Kid Laroi.</p>
<p>Madden Bowl</p>
<p>After Killer Mike collected three Grammys during his arrest-shortened
night, the Atlanta-based rapper is expected to be one of the performers
at the EA Sports’ The Madden Bowl.</p>
<p>Rock group Green Day will headline the Friday night event at House of
Blues. It will also feature Big Boi of OutKast and Breland.</p>
<p>“Las Vegas isn’t ready for the show we’re about to bring,” Big Boi
said.</p>
<p>In addition to the music performances, the event will include the
Madden NFL 24 Championship Series in front of a live audience — where
two of the world’s best players will travel to Las Vegas for their share
of the $1 million prize pool and title of Ultimate Madden Bowl
champion.</p>
<p>Kevin Hart and O’Neal’s production companies will hold a
star-studded, stand-up comedy showcase.</p>
<p>Actor Deon Cole will host the two-night show called the All Star
Comedy Jam with performances by D.L. Hughley, Earthquake, Desi Banks and
Aida Rodriguez. The event will be held inside the Resorts World Theatre’
5,000-capacity venue on Friday and Saturday night.</p>
<p>Gospel Celebration</p>
<p>Cedric the Entertainer and Tichina Arnold will help bring the gospel
to Sin City.</p>
<p>The stars of the CBS show The Neighborhood will host the Super Bowl
Soulful Celebration at the Palms Casino Resort on Wednesday night. The
lineup includes some of gospel’s best from Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Mary
Mary, Kirk Franklin, Robin Thicke and the NFL Players Choir including
Tully Banta-Cain and Bryan Scott, who played in the league.</p>
<p>“I want people to feel empowered walking away from this show,” Arnold
said. “You should never walk way feeling drained. You should walk way
feeling loved.”</p>
<p>CBS Mornings co-host Nate Burleson, a former NFL player, will receive
the Lifetime of Inspiration award. He will be the sixth person to
receive the honor the show’s 25-year history.</p>
<p>Previous recipients include Tony Dungy, Ray Lewis, Tim Brown, Troy
Vincent and Deion Sanders.</p>
<p>Gronk Beach</p>
<p>Despite being retired, Rob Gronkowski keeps making his presence felt
during the NFL’s championship week. </p>
<p>The four-time Super Bowl winner — who views himself the “MVP of Fun”
— will host a music festival called “Gronk Beach” the day before the big
game. The beach-themed party will feature a performance by DJ
Afrojack.</p>
<p>“It’s all about going there and having a good time. Just losing your
mind in a great and positive way,” Gronkowski said. “You can dance free,
be yourself freely and just enjoy yourself with great company around
you.”</p>
<p>Gronkowski placed his tickets starting at $74.</p>
<p>Billy Idol</p>
<p>Instead of riding his motorcycle on Super Bowl Sunday, Billy Idol
will be strolling on stage a few hours before kick off to perform during
a pre-game concert.</p>
<p>The legendary British rocker will perform Sunday just outside
Allegiant Stadium, where the NFL’s two best teams face off. He’s
expected to perform a 35-minute set on two different stages at On
Location’s Club 67 and Touchdown Club in front of nearly 9,000
guests.</p>
<p>Idol said he’s stoked about the setup being arranged by One Location
— a premium hospitality provider of the NFL. The hospitality company
offers various packages including Idol’s performance, attendance at NFL
Honors and postgame field access.</p>
<p>Maluma &amp; SiriusXM</p>
<p>Colombian superstar Maluma will take his vibrant Latin music vibes
into Las Vegas with the help of SiriusXM.</p>
<p>Maluma will headline a special concert at The Theater at Virgin
Hotels on Thursday night for SiriusXM subscribers and Pandora listeners.
He’s expected to perform songs from his latest album Don Juan including
Según Quién and COCO LOCO along with other fan favorites such as
Hawái.</p>
<p>Future and David Guetta are expected to perform at the invite-only
h.wood Homecoming Weekend pop up bash on Friday followed by another show
with Jack Harlow and Kaytranada performer the next night at a custom
venue on the Las Vegas Strip across from the Wynn.</p>
<p>On Saturday night, Zach Bryan will headline the Bud Light Backyard
Tour.</p>
<p>Tiësto will headline a show at LIV at Fontainebleau on Saturday while
21 Savage and 50 Cent are expected to perform the same night.</p>
<p>Lil Wayne will hit the stage once again but this time with T-Pain as
a co-headliner at the Alex Morgan and Dan Marino-hosted Michelob ULTRA
Country Club at Topgolf on Saturday night. Bryan and Leon Bridges will
perform at The Chelsea in The Cosmopolitan on Friday.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Guy Fieri will host his Guy’s Flavortown Tailgate, a free
and family-friendly event that he expects will draw more than 10,000.
Diplo will perform.</p>
<p>GQ will hold Super Bowl party Friday at the The Nomad Library and
sports agent Leigh Steinberg will host an event Saturday morning at
Ahern Luxury Boutique Hotel.</p>

Man Arrested in California for Theft of Trade Secrets</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A Chinese-born U.S. researcher has been arrested on
charges of stealing trade secrets, including technology used to detect
nuclear missile launches, the Justice Department said Wednesday. </p>
<p>Chenguang Gong, 57, of San Jose, California, was arrested on Tuesday,
the department said in a statement.</p>
<p>Gong, who became a US citizen in 2011, is accused of transferring
more than 3,600 files from the research and development company where he
briefly worked to personal storage devices.</p>
<p>The company was not identified.</p>
<p>According to court documents, the files included blueprints for
infrared sensors used in space-based systems to detect nuclear missile
launches and track ballistic and hypersonic missiles.</p>
<p>The files also allegedly included blueprints for sensors designed to
enable U.S. military aircraft to detect heat-seeking missiles and take
countermeasures.</p>
<p>U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada said Gong “had previously sought to
provide the People’s Republic of China with information to aid its
military.”</p>
<p>“We know that foreign actors, including the PRC, are actively seeking
to steal our technology, but we will remain vigilant against this threat
by safeguarding the innovations of American businesses and researchers,”
Estrada said.</p>
<p>According to court documents, Gong worked at the unidentified company
from January 2023 to April 2023 as a circuit design manager for infrared
sensors.</p>
<p>The Justice Department said meanwhile that two Iranians have been
charged in another case involving sensitive technology.</p>
<p>Abolfazi Bazzazi, 79, and his son Mohammad Resa Bazzazi, 43, were
indicted in New York on charges of violating export laws by conspiring
between 2008 and 2019 to export equipment used in the aerospace industry
to Iran.</p>
<p>“The Bazzazis devised an intricate scheme to evade US export laws in
obtaining U.S. equipment and technology to be exported to Iran and for
the Government of Iran,” U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said.</p>
<p>“The defendants allegedly attempted to obtain commercial and military
aircraft items from multiple U.S. companies that supply the military,
aerospace and firefighting industries,” Peace said.</p>
<p>The Bazzazis reside in Iran and remain at large.</p>

Overtakes China as Leading Source of Goods Imported to US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — For the first time in more than two decades, Mexico last
year surpassed China as the leading source of goods imported to the
United States. The shift reflects the growing tensions between
Washington and Beijing as well as U.S. efforts to import from countries
that are friendlier and closer to home.</p>
<p>Figures released Wednesday by the U.S. Commerce Department show that
the value of goods imported to the United States from Mexico rose nearly
5% from 2022 to 2023, to more than $475 billion. At the same time, the
value of Chinese imports imports tumbled 20% to $427 billion.</p>
<p>The last time that Mexican goods imported to the United States
exceeded the value of China’s imports was in 2002.</p>
<p>Economic relations between the United States and China have severely
deteriorated in recent years as Beijing has fought aggressively on trade
and made ominous military gestures in the Far East.</p>
<p>The Trump administration began imposing tariffs on Chinese imports in
2018, arguing that Beijing’s trade practices violated global trade
rules. President Joe Biden retained those tariffs after taking office in
2021, making clear that antagonism toward China would be a rare area of
common ground for Democrats and Republicans.</p>
<p>As an alternative to offshoring production to China, which U.S.
corporations had long engaged in, the Biden administration has urged
companies to seek suppliers in allied countries (“friend-shoring’‘) or
to return manufacturing to the United States (“reshoring’‘).
Supply-chain disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic also led U.S.
companies to seek supplies closer to the United States
(“near-shoring’’).</p>
<p>Mexico has been among the beneficiaries of the growing shift away
from reliance on Chinese factories. But the picture is more complicated
than it might seem. Some Chinese manufacturers have established
factories in Mexico to exploit the benefits of the 3-year-old
U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement, which allows for duty-free trade in
North America for many products.</p>
<p>Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said this week that the
trade status gives Mexico new leverage, saying it would make it hard for
the U.S. to close the two countries’ border to limit immigration, as
suggested in negotiations on a border bill in the U.S. Senate.</p>
<p>“The negotiation is proposing closing the border,” he said. “Do you
think Americans, or Mexicans, but especially the Americans, would
approve that? The businesses wouldn’t take it, maybe one day, but not a
week.”</p>
<p>Some industries — especially auto manufacturers — have set up plants
on both sides of the border that depend on each for a steady supply of
parts.</p>
<p>Derek Scissors, a China specialist at the conservative American
Enterprise Institute, noted that the biggest drops in Chinese imports
were in computers and electronics and chemicals and pharmaceuticals —
all politically sensitive categories.</p>
<p>“I don’t see the U.S. being comfortable with a rebound in those areas
in 2024 and 2025,” Scissors said, predicting that the China-Mexico
reversal on imports to the United States likely “is not a one-year
blip.’’</p>
<p>Scissors suggested that the drop in U.S. reliance on Chinese goods
partly reflects wariness of Beijing’s economic policies under President
Xi Jinping. Xi’s draconian COVID-19 lockdowns brought significant swaths
of the Chinese economy to a standstill in 2022, and his officials have
raided foreign companies in apparent counterespionage
investigations.</p>
<p>“I think it’s corporate America belatedly deciding Xi Jinping is
unreliable,” he said.</p>
<p>Overall, the U.S. deficit in the trade of goods with the rest of the
world — the gap between the value of what the United States sells and
what it buys abroad — narrowed 10% last year to $1.06 trillion.</p>

<h2 id="beyond-the-1-mb-barrier-in-dos">Beyond the 1 MB barrier in
DOS</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Last month, we covered Julio Merino’s article about going from 0 to 1
MB in DOS, and now they’re back for breaking beyond that 1 MB barrier. I
know I promised that this follow-up article would be about DJGPP, but
before getting into that review, I realized I had to take another detour
to cover three more topics. Namely: unreal mode, which I intentionally
ignored to not derail the post; LOADALL, which I didn’t know about until
you readers mentioned it; and DOS extenders, which I was planning to
describe in the DJGPP article but they are a better fit for this one.
So… strap your seat belts on and dive right in for another tour through
the ancient techniques that DOS had to pull off to peek into the memory
address space above the first MB. And get your hands ready because we’ll
go over assembly code for a step-by-step jump into unreal mode. ↫ Julio
Merino What’s amazing is that I don’t even remember having to deal with
any of this while using MS-DOS back in the day. Games tended to use DOS
extenders automatically (DOS/4G!), but I don’t remember if I ever had to
set up any of the DOS above-640k stuff manually.</p>

id="special-counsel-completes-biden-classified-documents-investigation">Special
Counsel Completes Biden Classified Documents Investigation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The Justice Department special counsel investigating
President Joe Biden’s handling of classified documents has completed his
inquiry and is expected to make a report soon to Congress and the
public, Attorney General Merrick Garland told lawmakers in a letter
Wednesday. </p>
<p>Garland did not detail the conclusions of the report from special
counsel Robert Hur, but said he was committed to disclosing as much of
the document as possible once the White House completes a review for
potential executive privilege concerns. That process is expected to be
completed by the end of the week, said Ian Sams, a spokesman for the
White House counsel’s office. </p>
<p>The yearlong investigation centered on the improper retention of
classified documents by Biden from his time as a U.S. senator and as
vice president. Sensitive records were found at his Delaware home and at
a private office that he used in between his service in the Obama
administration and becoming president. </p>
<p>The resolution of the investigation arrives in a pivotal year for the
president as he pursues reelection in a deeply polarized political time.
Though the probe’s outcome is expected to lift a legal cloud over Biden,
criticism of his handling of classified records could blunt his ability
to attack Donald Trump - his presumptive opponent in November - over a
pending indictment charging the former president with hoarding
top-secret files at his Mar-a-Lago estate and obstructing FBI efforts to
get them back. </p>
<p>Challenge likely</p>
<p>Trump and other Republicans are likely to challenge the legitimacy of
the investigation by noting that it was launched by the Biden Justice
Department. </p>
<p>But Garland sought to insulate the department from claims of bias and
conflicts of interest by last year appointing Hur, a former U.S.
attorney for Maryland during the Trump administration, to handle the
Biden investigation and by naming a different special counsel, Jack
Smith, to oversee investigations into Trump. </p>
<p>While the Trump investigation resulted in dozens of felony charges
against the ex-president last year, the outcome of the Biden probe is
expected to be different. Justice Department policy prohibits the
indictment of a sitting president and, unlike in the Trump
investigation, no evidence has emerged to suggest that Biden engaged in
comparable conduct or willfully held on to records he wasn’t supposed to
have. </p>
<p>Even so, the White House’s response to the discovery of classified
documents early last year was delayed and incomplete. </p>
<p>The White House did not disclose the Justice Department’s
investigation until January 2023, when it acknowledged the discovery two
months earlier of a “small number” of classified documents by Biden
lawyers as they closed an office at the Penn Biden Center, a think tank
affiliated with the Ivy League school. Biden has said he was surprised
by the initial trove discovered by his lawyers. </p>
<p>The FBI subsequently conducted a 13-hour, top-to-bottom check of his
Wilmington, Delaware, home, where agents located documents with
classified markings from his time as a vice president and senator and
took possession of some of his handwritten notes. Biden’s personal
lawyers have also revealed that they had found a document bearing
classified markings while searching the Wilmington property but said
they had not found others during a separate inspection of his Rehoboth
Beach home. </p>
<p>The looming conclusion of the investigation had been foreshadowed
last fall when Biden sat for a voluntary interview at the White House
with Hur’s team. Interviews of key subjects in an investigation are
often done near the end. </p>
<p>Justice Department regulations require Congress to be notified of any
investigative steps or proposed actions by a special counsel that were
rejected by department leadership. There were no such actions, Garland
wrote.</p>

<h2 id="my-everything-everywhere-all-at-once-dream">My “Everything,
Everywhere, All at Once” Dream</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: Jessica Smith’s blog</p>
<p>
A few months ago I had this funny dream, which has come back into my
mind a few times since and I figure I might as well share. Basically I
was back at high school, but Penny Wong was our dictatorial principal,
and I was in her office getting castigated for something stupid
(probably shooting my mouth off in class; that would’ve been very
in-character for me at that time). Anyway, she assigned me to some
cleaning detail in punishment for what I’d done, which is where I think
you can see the influence of
<a href="https://www.jayeless.net/wiki/my-novel.html">my novel</a>
coming in because that’s a pretty standard punishment in the world of
that
story.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
So, there I was, miserably scrubbing windows and removing cobwebs and
whatnot, when I looked into one of the buildings and saw
<em>another</em> detention going on, an in-classroom detention, and who
should I see in detention but VIVIAN, my now-partner, mucking around
with some mates. But it wasn’t Vivian as I know him now, it was Vivian
as I’ve seen him in photos of his high school days, packing a bit too
much weight and sporting a crazy afro. So I decided to sneak away from
<em>my</em> detention, and went up to him in class, where he turned to
me with a blank, confused look in his eyes.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t know me in this universe, do you?” I asked.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” he said. “Uh, I mean, that’s correct, I don’t know you.” (This is
<em>exactly</em> how he answers negative tag questions in real life;
it’s so annoying.)
</p>
<p>
“Well,” I said, “in another universe, you know me <em>very</em> well.”
</p>
<p>
And I walked away again, leaving it at that. As I did, he kind of went
back to mucking around with his mates, but it was with half an eye on me
as I went, wondering what could’ve been.
</p>

<p>
Actually, I had one detention in year 12 where I was supposed to do
this, as well. I say “supposed to” because I was so annoyed I even HAD
detention (basically I’d been like ten seconds late to school, and then
five minutes later there was a fire drill and everyone had to congregate
outside, so if I’d come FIVE MINUTES LATE instead of TEN SECONDS no one

remember venting my frustration to my classmates that I was being

just flat-out refused to do it, and the teacher was so thrown (I was
mostly a good kid, just a smart ass) that she just went, “Okay then,”

High Court Hears Arguments on Trump’s Eligibility to Regain
Presidency</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments Thursday
about whether likely Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is
ineligible for the office and must be excluded from states’ ballots
because of his role in the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S.
Capitol.</p>
<p>On that day, a mob of the former president’s supporters who believed
his rhetoric that the November 2020 election was stolen stormed the
Capitol to try to prevent lawmakers from certifying Joe Biden’s
victory.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a federal appeals court rejected Trump’s claim
that he has “absolute immunity” from prosecution on criminal charges in
a separate election interference case, United States of America v.
Trump.</p>
<p>That case was brought by special counsel Jack Smith in U.S. District
Court in Washington, resulting in four indictments in connection with
Trump’s widespread efforts to overturn the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Trump is likely to also appeal this case to the Supreme Court. He
maintains the various criminal and civil lawsuits brought against him
are part of Biden’s “witch hunt” to eliminate a political opponent — a
claim the White House and Democrats deny.</p>
<p>Trump v. Anderson</p>
<p>Trump v. Anderson, to be brought before the Supreme Court on
Thursday, addresses whether Trump must be barred from participating in
the Colorado primary election under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to
the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>The case began as Anderson v. Griswold, filed by Citizens for
Responsibility and Ethics in Washington on behalf of Norma Anderson, a
former Republican lawmaker in Colorado, with five other Republican and
independent voters, against Colorado Secretary of State Jena
Griswold.</p>
<p>Both cases look at whether Trump is an insurrectionist who tried to
stop the peaceful transfer of power and whether under Section 3 he
should be barred from holding office again.</p>
<p>Section 3 was written in 1866 after the end of the Civil War to keep
former Confederates — officials from the 11 Southern states that seceded
from the United States to protect the institution of slavery — from
returning to power.</p>
<p>It provides: “No person shall be a Senator or Representative in
Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any
office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State,
who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an
officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature,
or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the
Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or
rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies
thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove
such disability.”</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers argue that Section 3 does not apply to presidents,
that January 6 was not an insurrection, and that Trump was only
exercising his free-speech rights.</p>
<p>In November, a Colorado judge ruled that Trump engaged in
insurrection. But she ruled against blocking him from the state’s 2024
presidential primary ballot, finding that Section 3 did not apply to the
president. That part of her ruling was appealed and later reversed by
the Colorado Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Amicus briefs</p>
<p>Various scholars, election officials, lawmakers and other political
figures have filed amicus — “friend of the court” — briefs to share
their views in support of or against Trump.</p>
<p>One of them is Mark Graber, Regents professor at the University of
Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law and a leading expert in
constitutional law on insurrections and the 14th Amendment. His brief
argues that the Colorado Supreme Court’s ruling is consistent with how
the legal community understood insurrection at the time Section 3 was
framed, and that it correctly ruled an insurrection occurred.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump incited that insurrection,” Graber told VOA.</p>
<p>“He was told his tweets were inspiring violence against election
workers. He responded by intensifying his tweets. He was told there were
people in the crowd with weapons who intended to invade Congress. He
responded by saying, ‘When there’s fraud, you don’t use the usual means.
You fight — you fight like hell,’” he said. “A reasonable person could
say given Trump’s behavior, he intended to inspire an insurrection and
participate.”</p>
<p>In response to another central question in this case — whether the
14th Amendment applies to the president — Graber said the answer was
“obvious.”</p>
<p>“Every member of Congress who used the phrase ‘officer of the United
States’ in the 39th Congress said that the president was included,” he
underscored.</p>
<p>Others argue that enforcement of the 14th Amendment is for Congress
to determine, including Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, who filed
a brief with 26 other Republican attorneys general.</p>
<p>“Section 3 is not self-executing textually,” he said during a
Wednesday event hosted by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think
tank. He argued that under Section 5 that provides, “Congress shall have
power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this
article,” lawmakers should determine how the 14th Amendment is to be
enforced.</p>
<p>Alan Dershowitz, Felix Frankfurter professor of law at Harvard Law
School who defended Trump during his Senate impeachment trial, supports
this argument.</p>
<p>“In the absence of congressional action, I don’t believe the 14th
Amendment is self-enforcing,” he told VOA. “Otherwise, why would you
need Article 5 of the 14th Amendment that explicitly gives Congress the
power to make these decisions?”</p>
<p>A group of 25 leading historians, including Allan J. Lichtman,
distinguished professor of history at American University, argued in
their brief that Section 3 covers Trump and does not “require another
act of Congress or a conviction” of insurrection.</p>
<p>Lichtman told VOA it’s clear that Section 3 is designed to guard
against “not just ex-Confederates but future insurrectionists.”</p>
<p>“They wanted an amendment that would last in perpetuity and couldn’t
be tampered with by future congresses because it’s part of the
Constitution,” Lichtman said.</p>
<p>Legal questions aside, the American people should have the right to
choose their president, not judges, said Rokita. “Voters will lose all
confidence if judges decide that voters cannot even consider one of our
nation’s two leading presidential candidates,” he warned.</p>
<p>Far-reaching impact</p>
<p>Although the Supreme Court will only decide on the Colorado case, the
impact would be far-reaching, including for the state of Maine, whose
secretary of state ruled in December that Trump should be taken off the
state’s primary ballot, and pending cases in 11 other states that
challenge his electoral eligibility, as well as others in the
future.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court could uphold the Colorado ruling, which would be a
devastating blow to Trump’s reelection bid. Or it could rule that Trump
cannot be disqualified under Section 3 and put him back on the
ballot.</p>
<p>The justices could also decline to make a final decision and leave it
to lawmakers - for example, let Congress decide whether to certify
Trump’s victory should he win in November.</p>
<p>Six of the nine Supreme Court justices were appointed by Republican
presidents, including three by Trump. But since the question has almost
no legal precedent, it’s difficult to predict the justices’ individual
rulings based on their ideology.</p>
<p>It will be difficult for the justices to “contradict the historical
evidence,” said Lichtman. However, given the political magnitude, the
Supreme Court is likely to “take a technical off-ramp” and “punt on this
issue.”</p>
<p>Dershowitz agreed, predicting the justices would either “say the 14th
Amendment just doesn’t apply absent congressional action, or they will
figure out some way of putting off the ultimate issue.”</p>
<p>He underscored the importance of a unanimous decision by the Supreme
Court.</p>
<p>“A split decision would keep the country very divided,” he said.
“That means we’re likely to see a narrow decision that doesn’t decide
broad issues.”</p>
<p>It is unclear how long the Supreme Court will take to rule. In the
coming months, the high court also will likely deliberate on Trump’s
appeal of the election interference case prosecuted by Smith, which was
rejected Tuesday by a federal appeals court.</p>

id="journalists-criticize-tucker-carlson-over-putin-interview">Journalists
Criticize Tucker Carlson Over Putin Interview</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Former Fox News anchor Tucker Carlon’s announcement on
Tuesday that he interviewed Russian President Vladimir Putin has been
met with disapproval from an array of journalists, some of whom say the
Kremlin may use the interview for propaganda purposes.</p>
<p>In a video posted on the social media platform X, Carlson said he
wanted to interview the longtime Russian leader because “Americans have
a right to know all they can about a war they are implicated in.”</p>
<p>In mid-March, Russia is set to hold presidential elections, which
Putin is all but guaranteed to win. Putin likely agreed to the interview
with Carlson because he thinks it will help his campaign, according to
Mikhail Rubin, deputy editor-in-chief of the Russian investigative
outlet Proekt Media.</p>
<p>Carlson “needs to understand that he’s a part of the presidential
election campaign, and he’s going to help [Putin], unfortunately,” Rubin
told VOA.</p>
<p>Rubin added that Carlson’s interview is likely to be used to paint
Moscow in a positive light.</p>
<p>“The most important is to show that Putin is open and that American
journalists can work inside Russia because Russia is an open and free
country,” Rubin said.</p>
<p>But that narrative is plainly false, said Rubin, who fled the country
in 2021 for safety reasons.</p>
<p>“If I go to Russia, as far as I understand, I will be arrested the
next day,” said Rubin, who is now based in Washington. “I’m not sure
that I will ever see my father again.”</p>
<p>Other Russian journalists shared similar critiques on social
media.</p>
<p>“I am like hundreds of Russian journalists who have had to go into
exile to keep reporting about the Kremlin’s war against Ukraine. The
alternative was to go to jail,” said Russian journalist Yevgenia Albats
on X. Meanwhile, Carlson was “shooting from the $1,000 Ritz suite in
Moscow,” she said.</p>
<p>Carlson also drew criticism for appearing to ignore the poor state of
press freedom in Russia, which has led to the arrests of scores of
reporters inside the country and forced many others into exile.</p>
<p>“Quite something to complain about how not enough American
journalists are reporting on the Russian side of Putin’s invasion of
Ukraine when two of them — Evan Gershkovich and Alsu Kurmasheva — are in
jail right now for doing just that,” Max Seddon, Moscow bureau chief for
the Financial Times, said in a post on X.  </p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal’s Gershkovich was arrested in March 2023 on
espionage charges that he, his employer and the U.S. government
vehemently deny.</p>
<p>Kurmasheva, an editor at VOA’s sister outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio
Liberty, was jailed in October 2023 and is facing charges for failing to
register as a “foreign agent” and spreading false information about the
Russian military. She and her employer reject the charges.</p>
<p>Besides Kurmasheva and Gershkovich, at least 20 other journalists
were jailed in Russia as of the end of 2023, according to data from the
Committee to Protect Journalists.</p>
<p>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the interview was recorded on
Tuesday.</p>
<p>The interview will likely be published Thursday, according to the
Wall Street Journal. Carlson said it will be uploaded live and unedited
to X, where he launched a show after he was abruptly fired from the
conservative channel Fox News last year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The right-wing television personality hosted a prime-time show on Fox
News from 2016 until his firing in 2023. Carlson’s departure came
shortly after Fox News agreed to pay over $787 million to Dominion
Voting Systems to settle a defamation lawsuit over false election
claims, many of which Carlson himself propagated.</p>
<p>The Tucker Carlson Network did not immediately reply to VOA’s email
requesting comment.</p>
<p>After accusing U.S. media of “fawning pep session” interviews with
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Carlson went on to claim that
“not a single Western journalist has bothered to interview the president
of the other country in this conflict, Vladimir Putin.”</p>
<p>Journalists took to social media to criticize that claim, as
well.</p>
<p>“Does Tucker really think we journalists haven’t been trying to
interview President Putin every day since his full-scale invasion of
Ukraine?” CNN’s Christiane Amanpour said in a post on X. “It’s absurd —
we’ll continue to ask for an interview, just as we have for years
now.”</p>
<p>Even the Kremlin fact-checked that claim from Carlson.</p>
<p>“No, Mr. Carlson is wrong. In fact, he cannot know this,” Peskov, the
spokesperson, said, adding that the Kremlin receives many requests for
interviews with Putin.</p>

16.2, 15.6, 14.11, 13.14, and 12.18 Released!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-08, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
The PostgreSQL Global Development Group has released an update to all
supported versions of PostgreSQL, including 16.2, 15.6, 14.11, 13.14,
and 12.18. This release fixes one security vulnerability and over 65
bugs reported over the last several months.
</p>
<p>
If you use GIN indexes, you may need to reindex after updating to this
release. Please see the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/">release notes</a> for
more information.
</p>
<p>
For the full list of changes, please review the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/">release notes</a>.

<h2>
Security Issues
</h2>
<h3>
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2024-0985/">CVE-2024-0985</a>:
PostgreSQL non-owner <code>REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY</code>
executes arbitrary SQL
</h3>
<p>
CVSS v3 Base Score:
<a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H">8.0</a>
</p>
<p>
Supported, Vulnerable Versions: 12 - 15.
</p>
<p>
One step of a concurrent refresh command was run under weak security
restrictions. If a materialized view’s owner could persuade a superuser
or other high-privileged user to perform a concurrent refresh on that
view, the view’s owner could control code executed with the privileges
of the user running <code>REFRESH</code>. The fix for the vulnerability
makes is so that all user-determined code is run as the view’s owner, as
expected.
</p>
<p>
The PostgreSQL project thanks Pedro Gallegos for reporting this problem.
</p>
<h2>
Bug Fixes and Improvements
</h2>
<p>
This update fixes over 65 bugs that were reported in the last several
months. The issues listed below affect PostgreSQL 16. Some of these
issues may also affect other supported versions of PostgreSQL.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Fix memory leak when performing JIT inlining that could lead to
out-of-memory conditions.
</li>
<li>
Several query planner fixes.
</li>
<li>
Align <code>MERGE</code> behavior with <code>UPDATE</code> when updating
a partition key column and skip firing <code>AFTER UPDATE ROW</code>
trigger and other post-update actions.
</li>
<li>
Fix problems with duplicate token names in <code>ALTER TEXT SEARCH
CONFIGURATION … MAPPING</code> commands.
</li>
<li>
Fix <code>DROP ROLE</code> with duplicate role names.
</li>
<li>
Properly lock the associated table during DROP STATISTICS to prevent
errors if <code>ANALYZE</code> is running concurrently.
</li>
<li>
Fix function volatility checking for <code>GENERATED</code> and
<code>DEFAULT</code> expressions.
</li>
<li>
Ensure collation matches when matching an existing index to a new
partitioned index.
</li>
<li>
Avoid failure if a child index is dropped concurrently with
<code>REINDEX INDEX</code> on a partitioned index.
</li>
<li>
Fix for locking during cleanup of GIN indexes. For this case, if
multiple processes tried to clean the same GIN index page, there was a
chance of index corruption. If you believe you were affected by this
issue, reindex your GIN indexes after installing this update.
</li>
<li>
Avoid failure with partitioned SP-GiST indexes.
</li>
<li>
Several ownership fixes for large objects.
</li>
<li>
In <code>EXPLAIN (BUFFERS)</code>, change name of I/O timing data
“shared/local” to “shared”.
</li>
<li>
Ensure durability of the <code>CREATE DATABASE</code> command if a
system crash occurred during or shortly after execution.
</li>
<li>
Add more logging messages when starting and ending recovery from a
backup.
</li>
<li>
Revert a change that made the walreceiver process unresponsive to
<code>SIGTERM</code> while waiting for a replication connection to be
established.
</li>
<li>
Several fixes for logical replication.
</li>
<li>
Fix incompatibility with OpenSSL 3.2.
</li>
<li>
Fix PL/pgSQL to allow <code>CREATE FUNCTION</code>/<code>CREATE
PROCEDURE</code> SQL commands that use SQL-standard function bodies.
</li>
<li>
Fix for error handling in
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-pipeline-mode.html">libpq
pipeline mode</a>.
</li>
<li>
Ensure <code>initdb</code> always uncomments
<code>postgresql.conf</code> entries for the <code>lc_</code> family of
parameters.
</li>
<li>
In <code>pg_dump</code>, don’t dump RLS policies or security labels for
extension member objects.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This release also updates time zone data files to tzdata release 2024a
for DST law changes in Greenland, Kazakhstan, and Palestine, plus
corrections for the Antarctic stations Casey and Vostok. Also historical
corrections for Vietnam, Toronto, and Miquelon.
</p>
<h2>
Updating
</h2>
<p>
All PostgreSQL update releases are cumulative. As with other minor
releases, users are not required to dump and reload their database or

Drone Strike in Iraq Kills Iran-Backed Militant Group Commander</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Pentagon — The United States military says it carried out a drone
strike on a vehicle in Baghdad, killing a leader of an Iranian-backed
militant group.</p>
<p>U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in the
Middle East, said the strike on Tuesday killed a commander of the
militant group Kataib Hezbollah who was “responsible for directly
planning and participating in attacks on U.S. forces in the region.”</p>
<p>Two U.S. officials confirmed to VOA that the commander was operations
officer Wisam Mohammad al-Saedi. Photos on social media allegedly showed
his Iraqi identification card that was pulled from his body.</p>
<p>VOA had earlier reported the United States military was involved in
an airstrike against a high-value target in the Middle East but had not
identified al-Saedi by name.</p>
<p>Video shared on social media showed a vehicle engulfed in flames on a
Baghdad highway.</p>
<p>The U.S. strike was in response to the almost 170 drone, rocket and
missile attacks against U.S. forces in the Middle East since
mid-October, one of which killed three U.S. service members and wounded
dozens more in northern Jordan last week.</p>
<p>A wave of U.S. airstrikes in Iraq and Syria on Friday pounded targets
associated with Iranian-backed militias responsible for the attacks. The
strikes targeted three locations in Iraq, as well as another four in
Syria, and they destroyed more than 80 individual targets, ranging from
command-and-control centers and intelligence hubs to missile and drone
storage facilities, according to the latest U.S. assessments.</p>
<p>But while U.S. officials have defended the strikes as necessary
following a drone attack that killed three U.S. soldiers at a base in
Jordan last month, Iraqi officials have voiced increased anger,
summoning the U.S. chargé d’affaires in Baghdad to protest. They have
charged that some of the U.S. strikes hit elements of Iraq’s own
security forces.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department said Monday that Iraq was not given any
warning but added the U.S. strikes should not have come as a
surprise.</p>
<p>Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder said Monday the U.S.
had no plans for a long-term military campaign against the militias in
Iraq and Syria, but he noted the U.S. response to the killing of its
service members was “not complete.”</p>
<p>The U.S. has about 2,500 troops in Iraq tasked with advising and
assisting Iraqi security forces as they pursue the remnants of the
Islamic State terror group, also known as ISIS or Daesh.</p>
<p>And while talks between the U.S. and Iraq are underway to eventually
reduce the U.S. military footprint and transition from the counter-IS
mission to what officials describe as more traditional
military-to-military relationship with Baghdad, the process has been
complicated by the attacks.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Iranian-backed Houthi militants once again ignored U.S.
calls to stop attacking international shipping lanes or face
consequences, this time firing six anti-ship missiles from
Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen into the Red Sea and the Gulf of
Aden.</p>
<p>U.S. Central Command said late Tuesday that one of the missiles
caused minor damage to the Marshall Islands-flagged, Greek
owned-and-operated bulk carrier MV Star Nasia in the Gulf of Aden, while
another missile landed in the water near the ship. U.S. forces shot down
a third missile in the area.</p>
<p>There were no reported injuries, and the ship was able to continue
toward its destination, CENTCOM said in a statement.</p>
<p>In the southern Red Sea, CENTCOM said three missiles likely targeting
the Barbados-flagged, U.K.-owned cargo ship MV Morning Tide landed in
the water without causing any damage.</p>
<p>The latest Houthi launches came as an unclassified Defense
Intelligence Agency report released Tuesday confirmed that Houthi
militants in Yemen were using various missiles and drones of Iranian
origin in its recent attacks across the region. The report compares
publicly available images of Iranian weapons to those employed by the
Houthis and highlights the strengthening relationship between the
Houthis and Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.</p>
<p>Earlier Tuesday, the U.S. military said it conducted its latest
self-defense strikes against two Houthi kamikaze drone boats that were
laden with explosives.</p>
<p>CENTCOM, which oversees U.S. forces in the region, said the vessels
“presented an imminent threat to U.S. Navy ships and merchant vessels in
the region.”</p>
<p>The Houthis have said their Red Sea attacks are in solidarity with
the people of Gaza and have vowed to continue them, despite the U.S. and
British strikes.</p>

<h2 id="apple-killed-music-on-the-move-for-me">2024-02-07 Apple killed
music on the move, for me</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
2024-02-07 Apple killed music on the move, for me
</h1>
<p>
I was thinking about joining the
<a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/cool-tech-zone/tangara">Tangara</a>
crowdfunding. It’s a kind of iPod, but better in that it is all open.
Yay!
</p>
<p>
But then I realized something: Having an iPhone made listening to music
such a shit show that I basically stopped and switched my entire
phone-based audio entertainment to podcasts. Because podcast clients are
great (at least <a href="https://icatcher.app/about/">iCatcher</a> is)
where as Apple Music is a pain. Having used iTunes when it was cool
until it was unusable, and then realizing what a pain the weird AAC
formats on the files were, and the DRM on some of them, preventing me
from playing them on other machines I owned. I was so angry.
</p>
<p>
In a fit of hate I decided I was going to
<a href="2019-07-08_Apple_Photos">move all my pictures out of
iPhotos</a> and all my music out of iTunes and never go back. And I did.
And so the Apple Music app died, and I guess no alternatives were
allowed on the App Store because Apple is great like that, and so when
the iPod classic I had with
<a href="2017-12-21_Rockbox_on_the_iPod">Rockbox</a> installed
<a href="2022-11-18_iPod%2C_iPad%2C_iPhone%2C_iPiss">finally died</a>,
all I was left with was podcasts on the iPhone.
</p>
<p>
And so now I don’t even know whether I want to listen to music any more
while I’m on the move.
</p>
<p>
Apple killed music on the move, for me.
</p>
<p>
At home it’s a different story, of course, but Tangara is a portable
music player.
</p>
<p>
I wish Tangara the best of luck.

hub motor-wheel in a rear hole on a snowboard and puts the battery in a
backpack that the rider must wear. Cyrusher states that the Ripple can
go 30+ miles at speeds up to 30 miles per hour.

To our surprise, they actually had some review models and sent us one
that we took up to Vermont to put through the paces. Would it actually
work, and more importantly, would it be a fun form of transportation?

<p>Social networks and RSS. We really should be on the case for all
social media networks to support RSS feeds outbound at least (inbound
nice too). And also add features to make interop really useful. I’ve
enumerated them <a href="https://textcasting.org/">here</a>. I am making
software that builds on this feature in social networks. And yes we do
have some examples of that, thinking of WordPress and competitors. I
think they are perfectly good bases for social networks.</p>

<p>I went skiing today at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belleayre_Mountain">Belleayre</a>.
First time in five years. It was great. I’ve been working out to get
ready for it, and was concerned maybe I’m finally too old, but it’s
good. My body remembers how to ski. And being in shape makes the
difference. No doubt at some point I will be too old for it. But not
yet. And the snow was really good, for the east. Packed powder, very
little ice. No lift lines. Sometimes a little crowded on the slopes but
about the same as any ski area in the west. It pays to go on weekdays if
you can. Here’s a

Soon Be Getting More Air Quality Alerts</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTQwNjM0OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1OTU3NDUwOH0.pOaylM8OV6uqh03-QBKJZQMFePVOAAYm2mhTQZYizEE/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
The Environmental Protection Agency finalized new air pollution rules on
Wednesday, strengthening standards that had not been updated in over a
decade. Somewhat counterintuitively, the change could mean that even as
the air gets cleaner, you might get more air quality alerts.
</p>
<p>
As part of the rule change, the EPA updated its Air Quality Index, that
colorful scale that many Americans grew
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/wildfire-smoke-aqi-eyewatering-acres" target="_self">intimately
familiar with</a> last summer, as wildfire smoke went from being a West
Coast problem to a hazard for almost the entire country, seemingly
overnight.
</p>
<p>
The AQI is both easy to interpret, with a color code that goes from a
healthy green to a perilous purple, and esoteric. The colors correspond
with numbers from zero to upwards of 300, and those numbers correspond
with measures of five different pollutants — particulate matter, ozone,
carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide.
</p>
<p>
The Clean Air Act tasks the EPA with
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/criteria-air-pollutants/naaqs-table" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">setting
standards</a> for each of these pollutants. If local concentrations of
any one of them tick up above those protective standards, the AQI will
jump from green to a more alarming color. The higher the level of
pollution is, the higher the AQI and the darker the color will be.
</p>
<p>
Previously, the EPA’s annual standard for concentrations of particulate
matter was 12 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3). Based on
epidemiological research showing that this standard did not adequately
protect public health, the agency has now lowered the standard to 9
µg/m3.
</p>
<p>
Air quality has improved immensely since the 1970s when the Clean Air
Act was passed, preventing
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/clean-air-act-overview/highlights-clean-air-act-40th-anniversary" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hundreds
of thousands of premature deaths</a>. But thousands of people still die
early, are rushed to the emergency room, develop asthma, or miss work
due to air pollution.
</p>
<p>
The new AQI scale doesn’t mean you need to rethink how you make
decisions about when to spend time outdoors or whether to wear a mask.
But it does mean that if and when people make decisions based on the
AQI, they will be more informed by the science and, in aggregate,
contribute to lower all of these public health costs. The rules are
expected to prevent 4,500 premature deaths per year by 2032.

</p>
<p>
Some parts of the country could start to see more days with “moderate
air quality,” the yellow category. “People who live in places that have
frequent flips over nine — those will be people who have environmental
justice issues or live near traffic and industries and big cities and so
forth — they are going to get warned a little more,” John Bachmann, a
former associate director in EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation told me.
“Which is a positive thing.” The agency
<a href="https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/" target="_blank">considers
moderate air quality</a> to be “acceptable,” but there may still be a
risk for people who are particularly sensitive to pollution.
</p>
<p>
Also, during major air quality events like wildfires or chemical fires,
impacted areas could now be deemed “hazardous” when previously they may
have been “very unhealthy,” or deemed “very unhealthy” when before they
would have been simply “unhealthy.” This will affect when and how public
health officials respond to these kinds of events.
</p>
<p>
“This is for everybody, not just the most exposed or the most sensitive
people. So on both ends of it, this is a step in the right direction,”
Bachmann said.
</p>
<p>
As part of the changes, the agency will also now require cities with
more than 350,000 people to report the AQI seven days a week, up from
five — a rule that’s been in place since 1999. However, the agency said
that most states and cities are already doing this.
</p>
<p>
The new AQI scale will take effect in 60 days, in early April.

World’s Biggest Offshore Wind Developer Had a Horrible 2023, and It’s
America’s Fault</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTQwNzM5MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxODI1MjI2N30.tYaJn0S-vYdnrdVoi7fXeZwSm7Uj4X4npgPnnuXVF8M/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
The Danish energy developer Orsted delivered a withering verdict on its
experiment trying to build wind farms in the United States: Bad. It’s
lost a ton of money, the company said Wednesday, so it’s going to do
less of that going forward, and take on way less risk.
</p>
<p>
That Orsted had struggled in the U.S. offshore wind market was no secret
— late last year, it
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/everyones-mad-at-offshore-wind-developers" target="_self">cancelled
two projects in New Jersey</a> — but its earnings report put some grim
figures on it.
</p>
<p>
The company said that it had 9.6 billion Danish kroner worth of fees
(about $1.4 billion) related to one New Jersey project, Ocean Wind 1,
and had booked $4 billion of losses, most of which were due to Ocean
Wind 1’s cancellation. Overall, it reported a a loss of almost $3
billion in 2023, entirely due to the fees and impairments it reported.
Otherwise, the company would have had a more than $2 billion
profit.<br/> <br/> The company’s offshore wind misadventure won’t just
weigh on its balance sheet or stock price. Investors, including the
Danish government, will miss out on the company’s dividend for three
years, through 2025. And the company’s chairman, Thomas Thune Andersen,
said he would step down next month.
</p>
<p>
All this also meant that the company expects to have
<a href="https://orstedcdn.azureedge.net/-/media/annual-report-2023/orsted-ar-2023.pdf?rev=526307f68e2047b3a1df8dd2cdf719ec&hash=E6069E12C1792AD620FA12898587394C" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">far
less installed renewable capacity</a> developed by the end of the decade
than it had previously targeted, down to 35 to 28 gigawatts from the 50
GW it had projected as recently as last year. (It has just under 16 GW
at the moment.) The company will cut its planned investment by more than
half, according to Morningstar analyst Tancrede Fulop.
</p>
<p>
Orsted and other wind developers have blamed a combination of supply
chain issues, high interest rates, and inflexibility in the contracts
signed with state governments for the failures, delays, and
cancellations of projects
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/everyones-mad-at-offshore-wind-developers" target="_self">up
and down the East Coast</a> last year. In New York, Orsted and other
developers failed to get their contracts adjusted to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/offshore-wind-new-york-public-service-commission" target="_self">account
for higher costs</a>, and so were forced to cancel and, in some cases,
re-bid.
</p>
<p>
The company said in a presentation to investors that it was “now focused
predominantly on the Northeast,” essentially throwing in the towel on
anywhere south of New York, having withdrawn from the New Jersey project
and declaring that its
<a href="https://orsted.com/en/media/news/2024/01/skipjack-wind-to-be-repositioned-for-future-offtak-815811" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Maryland
project</a>, Skipjack, will continue development “with minimal spend.”
</p>
<p>
The trouble wasn’t just in the United States, though — Orsted also said
it was pulling out of Norway, Spain, and Portugal, while it was
“deprioritising development in other markets including Japan.” It does,
however, seem committed to maintaining some presence here, having
submitted a
<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/offshore-wind-new-york-developers-rebid-equinor-bp-orsted-eversource-rwe-national-grid/705852/#:~:text=%C3%98rsted%20also%20rebid%20its%20924,power%20supply%20contract%20in%20October." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new
bid for Sunrise Wind</a>, a planned wind farm off the east coast of Long
Island.
</p>
<p>
In a call with analysts, the company’s chief executive Mads Nipper said
that Orsted will spend far less money on projects before making the
final approval to go forward with construction. The company also said
that it will “pursue offtake opportunities where attractive with low
pre-FID commitments and inflation protection” — in other words, bid for
projects with low upfront costs and someone else around to absorb rising
costs.

<h2 id="a-rant-on-arc-search">A rant on ARC Search</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
I was listening to the most recent
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/6/24063221/ai-search-arc-galaxy-s24-spatial-video-vergecast">Vergecast</a>
episode last night and an interview with Josh Miller, CEO of The Browser
Company, makers of the ARC Browser and the new ARC Search app. I found
the whole interview baffling.
</p>
<p>
Josh is rightfully complaining about the state of the web, specifically
the mobile web, but the solution he’s proposing is so stupidly naive
that I’m not entirely sure whether he’s just fucking with us.
</p>
<p>
His whole point is that search engines are not the best way to surface
information. You search for something, you’re presented with a list of
links, and you have to click through them and actively look for the
thing you were searching for. The proposed solution is AI—who would have
thought—that essentially googles for you, “reads” a bunch of the links,
and then creates a summary page.
</p>
<p>
All this is obviously done by stripping away all the tracking and ads
that are part of today’s web.
</p>
<p>
You’re smart and so you probably spotted the issue with this approach
already. Firstly, without a search engine in the mix, the AI has no way
to search for anything. So if the goal is to replace the traditional
search engine then we’re already failing. Because we’re not replacing
anything, we’re just hiding it behind some AI tool.
</p>
<p>
Maybe this is a problem that can be solved by maintaining a new
dedicated index but then you just have a search engine with a different
UI in front of it.
</p>
<p>
The second issue is one of trust. Should I just trust ARC Search? Who
can guarantee that the sources used by ARC are not just companies that
have paid ARC to be used as such? “But Manu, ARC Search doesn’t just
provide the answer to your query, it also provides links to the
sources.“ Well then congratulations, you just recreated an AI-nerfed
SERP with fewer links and more extra layers.
</p>
<p>
Now, let’s ignore all this and imagine this approach does work. Let’s
imagine we all get on board with this stupid idea of having an AI
searching for you. What happens to the web as a whole? Why should I keep
creating content for the web if I’m a content creator who relies on
traffic to run my creative business? No one will visit my site because
the relevant content will be consumed by some boring ass generated
pages. And without content on the web, products like ARC Search are
pointless.
</p>
<p>
What would happen, if something like this were to go mainstream, is that
more and more content would go behind a paywall, kept away from AI. And
for good reason.
</p>
<p>
I’m very unimpressed by this interview. I’m also very unimpressed by
most AI products these days.
</p>
<p>
The problem with search is not the UI. Having an AI search for me won’t
solve the issue of the sea of garbage content out there.
</p>
<p>
But hey, the product is here so let’s take it for a spin and see if it’s
any good. I just downloaded ARC Search on my phone and searched for
<em>“books on Japanese aesthetics”</em>.
</p>
<p>
This is what a “regular” search looks like inside ARC search and yes,
that’s a Google search, because it obviously is.
</p>
<figure class="m-o" data-template="with">
<div class="m-m">
<img class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-rant-on-arc-search/ee7cc1b9d8-1707328208/google.jpg" style="aspect-ratio:1000 / 721">
</div>
</figure>
<p>
The first thing I see is a books section with 4 suggested books and 42
more 1 click away. If I’m looking for a book, that’s probably a good
enough starting point. Below that section, there are a bunch of sites,
related queries, the usual stuff.
</p>
<p>
Let’s do the same thing, using this revolutionary way to browse the web
powered by AI. Conveniently, ARC tells me the AI is reading 6 web pages.
</p>
<figure class="m-o" data-template="with">
<div class="m-m">
<img class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-rant-on-arc-search/6f75e932fd-1707328206/arc-1.jpg" style="aspect-ratio:616 / 1333">
</div>
</figure>
<p>
There are probably 700-billion-trillion pages out there but ARC has
picked 6. Why those 6? No idea. Have those 6 paid to be there? No idea.
Should I just trust that those 6 are reputable sources? Yup. A couple of
seconds later this is what I get:
</p>
<figure class="m-o" data-template="with">
<div class="m-m">
<img class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/a-rant-on-arc-search/f6ea8736f5-1707328207/arc-2.jpg" style="aspect-ratio:1000 / 433">
</div>
</figure>
<p>
5 books recommended to me in a somewhat compact list. Then I have 3 Top
Search Results that are just the top 3 links in Google search. After
that I get a completely pointless repetition of the initial list but
this time with some more information and worse information density. At
the end, I get a bunch of more links.
</p>
<p>
Can you tell me in what way this is better than a normal search results
page? The problem with search is that it’s full of fucking spam and ads.
That’s the problem with search. The solution to search is not to
“reinvent the browser” or to use AI to power searches for you. The
solution to search is a search engine that is aligned with the users.
</p>
<p>
I’d much rather support <a href="https://kagi.com">Kagi</a> and
<a href="https://search.marginalia.nu">Marginalia</a> than The Browser
Company.

<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links The CHIPS Act treats the symptoms, but not the causes:
Monopoly destroyed America’s high-tech capacity. Hey look at this:
Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023
Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current
writing projects, current reading The CHIPS Act treats the symptoms, but
not the causes (permalink) There’s this great throwaway line in 1992’s
Sneakers, where Dan Aykroyd, playing a conspiracy-addled hacker/con-man,
is feverishly telling Sydney Poitier (playing an ex-CIA spook) about a
1958 meeting Eisenhower had with aliens where Ike said, “hey, look, give
us your technology, and we’ll give you all the cow lips you want.”
Poitier dismisses Aykroyd (“Don’t listen to this man. He’s
certifiable”). We’re meant to be on Poitier’s side here, but I’ve always
harbored some sympathy for Aykroyd in this scene. That’s because I often
hear echoes of Aykroyd’s theory in my own explanations of the esoteric
bargains and plots that produced the world we’re living in today. Of
course, in my world, it’s not presidents bargaining for alien technology
in exchange for cow-lips – it’s the world’s wealthy nations bargaining
to drop trade restrictions on the Global South in exchange for IP laws.
These bargains – which started as a series of bilateral and then
multilateral agreements like NAFTA, and culminated in the WTO agreement
of 1999 – were the most important step in the reordering of the world’s
economy around rent-extraction, cheap labor exploitation, and a brittle
supply chain that is increasingly endangered by the polycrisis of
climate and its handmaidens, like zoonotic plagues, water wars, and mass
refugee migration. Prior to the advent of “free trade,” the world’s rich
countries fashioned debt into a whip-hand over poor, post-colonial
nations. These countries had been bankrupted by their previous colonial
owners, and the price of their freedom was punishing debts to the IMF
and other rich-world institutions in exchange for loans to help these
countries “develop.” Like all poor debtors, these countries were said to
have gotten into their predicament through moral failure – they’d “lived
beyond their means.” (When rich people get into debt, bankruptcy steps
in to give them space to “restructure” according to their own plans.
When poor people get into debt, bankruptcy strips them of nearly
everything that might help them recover, brands them with a permanent
scarlet letter, and subjects them to humiliating micro-management whose
explicit message is that they are not competent to manage their own
affairs): https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/07/hr-4193/#shoppers-choice So
the poor debtor nations were ordered to “deregulate.” They had to sell
off their state assets, run their central banks according to the
dictates of rich-world finance authorities, and reorient their
production around supplying raw materials to rich countries, who would
process these materials into finished goods for export back to the poor
world. Naturally, poor countries were not allowed to erect “trade
barriers” that might erode the capacity of this North-South transfer of
high-margin goods, but this was not the era of free trade. It wasn’t the
free trade era because, while the North-South transfer was largely
unrestricted, the South-North transfer was subject to tight regulation
in the rich world. In other words, poor countries were expected to
export, say, raw ore to the USA and reimport high-tech goods, with low
tariffs in both directions. But if a poor country processed that ore
domestically and made its own finished goods, the US would block those
goods at the border, slapping them with high tariffs that made them more
expensive than Made-in-the-USA equivalents. The argument for this
unidirectional trade was that the US – and other rich countries – had a
strategic need to maintain their manufacturing industries as a hedge
against future geopolitical events (war, but also pandemics, extreme
weather) that might leave the rich world unable to provide for itself.
This rationale had a key advantage: it was true. A country that manages
its own central bank can create as much of its own currency as it wants,
and use that money to buy anything for sale in its own currency. This
may not be crucial while global markets are operating to the country’s
advantage (say, while the rest of the world is “willingly” pricing its
raw materials in your country’s currency), but when things go wrong –
war, plague, weather – a country that can’t make things is at the rest
of the world’s mercy. If you had to choose between being a poor
post-colonial nation that couldn’t supply its own technological needs
except by exporting raw materials to rich countries, and being a rich
country that had both domestic manufacturing capacity and a steady
supply of other countries’ raw materials, you would choose the second,
every time. What’s not to like? Here’s what. The problem – from the
perspective of America’s ultra-wealthy – was that this arrangement gave
the US workforce a lot of power. As US workers unionized, they were able
to extract direct concessions from their employers through collective
bargaining, and they could effectively lobby for universal worker
protections, including a robust welfare state – in both state and
federal legislatures. The US was better off as a whole, but the richest
ten percent were much poorer than they could be if only they could smash
worker power. That’s where free trade comes in. Notwithstanding racist
nonsense about “primitive” countries, there’s no intrinsic defect that
stops the global south from doing high-tech manufacturing. If the rich
world’s corporate leaders were given free rein to sideline America’s
national security in favor of their own profits, they could certainly
engineer the circumstances whereby poor countries would build
sophisticated factories to replace the manufacturing facilities that sat
behind the north’s high tariff walls. These poor-country factories could
produce goods ever bit as valuable as the rich world’s shops, but
without the labor, environmental and financial regulations that
constrained their owners’ profits. They slavered for a business
environment that let them kill workers; poison the air, land and water;
and cheat the tax authorities with impunity. For this plan to work, the
wealthy needed to engineer changes in both the rich world and the poor
world. Obviously, they would have to get rid of the rich world’s tariff
walls, which made it impossible to competitively import goods made in
the global south, no matter how cheaply they were made. But free trade
wasn’t just about deregulation in the north – it also required a whole
slew of new, extremely onerous regulations in the global south.
Corporations that relocated their manufacturing to poor – but nominally
sovereign – countries needed to be sure that those countries wouldn’t
try to replicate the American plan of becoming actually sovereign, by
exerting control over the means of production within their borders.
Recall that the American Revolution was inspired in large part by fury
over the requirement to ship raw materials back to Mother England and
then buy them back at huge markups after they’d been processed by
English workers, to the enrichment of English aristocrats. Post-colonial
America created new regulations (tariffs on goods from England), and –
crucially – they also deregulated. Specifically, post-revolutionary
America abolished copyrights and patents for English persons and firms.
That way, American manufacturers could produce sophisticated finished
goods without paying rent to England’s wealthy making those goods
cheaper for American buyers, and American publishers could subsidize
their editions of American authors’ books by publishing English authors
on the cheap, without the obligation to share profits with English
publishers or English writers. The surplus produced by ignoring the
patents and copyrights of the English was divided (unequally) among
American capitalists, workers, and shoppers. Wealthy Americans got
richer, even as they paid their workers more and charged less for their
products. This incubated a made-in-the-USA edition of the industrial
revolution. It was so successful that the rest of the world – especially
England – began importing American goods and literature, and then
American publishers and manufacturers started to lean on their
government to “respect” English claims, in order to secure bilateral
protections for their inventions and books in English markets. This was
good for America, but it was terrible for English manufacturers. The US
– a primitive, agricultural society – “stole” their inventions until
they gained so much manufacturing capacity that the English public
started to prefer American goods to English ones. This was the thing
that rich-world industrialists feared about free trade. Once you build
your high-tech factories in the global south, what’s to stop those
people from simply copying your plans – or worse, seizing your
factories! – and competing with you on a global scale? Some of these
countries had nominally socialist governments that claimed to explicitly
elevate the public good over the interests of the wealthy. And all of
these countries had the same sprinkling of sociopaths who’d gladly see a
million children maimed or the land poisoned for a buck – and these
“entrepreneurs” had unbeatable advantages with their countries’
political classes. For globalization to work, it wasn’t enough to
deregulate the rich world – capitalists also had to regulate the poor
world. Specifically, they had to get the poor world to adopt “IP” laws
that would force them to willingly pay rent on things they could get for
free: patents and other IP, even though it was in the short-term,
medium-term, and long-term interests of both the nation and its
politicians and its businesspeople. Thus, the bargain that makes me
sympathetic to Dan Aykroyd: not cow lips for alien tech; but free trade
for IP law. When the WTO was steaming towards passage in the late 1990s,
there was (rightly) a lot of emphasis on its deregulatory provisions:
weakening of labor, environmental and financial laws in the poor world,
and of tariffs in the rich world. But in hindsight, we all kind of
missed the main event: the TRIPS (Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of
Intellectual Property Rights). This actually started before the WTO
treaty (it was part of the GATT, a predecessor to the WTO), but the WTO
spread it to countries all over the world. Under the TRIPS, poor
countries are required to honor the IP claims of rich countries, on pain
of global sanction. That was the plan: instead of paying American
workers to make Apple computers, say, Apple could export the “IP” for
Macs and iPhones to countries like China, and these countries would
produce Apple products that were “designed in California, assembled in
China.” China would allow Apple to treat Chinese workers so badly that
they routinely committed suicide, and would lock up or kill workers who
tried to unionize. China would accept vast shipments of immortal, toxic
e-waste. And China wouldn’t let its entrepreneurs copy Apple’s designs,
be they software, schematics or trademarks. Apple isn’t the only company
that pursued this strategy, but no company has executed it as
successfully. It’s not for nothing that Steve Jobs’s hand-picked
successor was Tim Cook, who oversaw the transfer of even the most
exacting elements of Apple manufacturing to Chinese facilities, striking
bargains with contractors like Foxconn that guaranteed that workers
would be heavily – lethally! – surveilled and controlled to prevent the
twin horrors of unionization and leaks. For the first two decades of the
WTO era, the most obvious problems with this arrangement was wage
erosion (for American workers) and leakage (for the rich). China’s
“socialist” government was only too happy to help Foxconn imprison
workers who demanded better wages and working conditions, but they were
far more relaxed about knockoffs, be they fake iPods sold in market
stalls or US trade secrets working their way into Huawei products. These
were problems for the American aristocracy, whose investments depended
on China disciplining both Chinese workers and Chinese businesses. For
the American people, leakage was a nothingburger. Apple’s profits
weren’t shared with its workforce beyond the relatively small number of
tech workers at its headquarters. The vast majority of Apple employees,
who flogged iPhones and scrubbed the tilework in gleaming white stores
across the nation, would get the same minimal (or even minimum) wage no
matter how profitable Apple grew. It wasn’t until the pandemic that the
other shoe dropped for the American public. The WTO arrangement – cow
lips for alien technology – had produced a global system brittle supply
chains composed entirely of weakest links. A pandemic, a war, a ship
stuck in the Suez Canal or Houthi paramilitaries can cripple the entire
system, perhaps indefinitely. For two decades, we fought over
globalization’s effect on wages. We let our corporate masters trick us
into thinking that China’s “cheating” on IP was a problem for the
average person. But the implications of globalization for American
sovereignty and security were banished to the xenophobic right fringe,
where they were mixed into the froth of Cold War 2.0 nonsense. The
pandemic changed that, creating a coalition that is motivated by a
complex and contradictory stew of racism, environmentalism, xenophobia,
labor advocacy, patriotism, pragmatism, fear and hope. Out of that stew
emerged a new American political tendency, mostly associated with
Bidenomics, but also claimed in various guises by the American right,
through its America First wing. That tendency’s most visible artifact is
the CHIPS Act, through which the US government proposes to use policy
and subsidies to bring high-tech manufacturing back to America’s shores.
This week, the American Economic Liberties Project published “Reshoring
and Restoring: CHIPS Implementation for a Competitive Semiconductor
Industry,” a fascinating, beautifully researched and detailed analysis
of the CHIPS Act and the global high-tech manufacturing market, written
by Todd Achilles, Erik Peinert and Daniel Rangel:
https://www.economicliberties.us/our-work/reshoring-and-restoring-chips-implementation-for-a-competitive-semiconductor-industry/#
Crucially, the report lays out the role that the weakening of antitrust,
the dismantling of tariffs and the strengthening of IP played in the
history of the current moment. The failure to enforce antitrust law
allowed for monopolization at every stage of the semiconductor
industry’s supply-chain. The strengthening of IP and the weakening of
tariffs encouraged the resulting monopolies to chase cheap labor
overseas, confident that the US government would punish host countries
that allowed their domestic entrepreneurs to use American designs
without permission. The result is a financialized, “capital light”
semiconductor industry that has put all its eggs in one basket. For the
most advanced chips (“leading-edge logic”), production works like this:
American firms design a chip and send the design to Taiwan where TSMC
foundry turns it into a chip. The chip is then shipped to one of a small
number of companies in the poor world where they are assembled, packaged
and tested (AMP) and sent to China to be integrated into a product.
Obsolete foundries get a second life in the commodity chip (“mature-node
chips”) market – these are the cheap chips that are shoveled into our
cars and appliances and industrial systems. Both of these systems are
fundamentally broken. The advanced, “leading-edge” chips rely on
geopolitically uncertain, heavily concentrated foundries. These
foundries can be fully captured by their customers – as when Apple
prepurchases the entire production capacity of the most advanced chips,
denying both domestic and offshore competitors access to the newest
computation. Meanwhile, the less powerful, “mature node” chips command
minuscule margins, and are often dumped into the market below cost,
thanks to subsidies from countries hoping to protect their corner of the
high-tech sector. This makes investment in low-power chips uncertain,
leading to wild swings in cost, quality and availability of these
workhorse chips. The leading-edge chipmakers – Nvidia, Broadcom,
Qualcomm, AMD, etc – have fully captured their markets. They like the
status quo, and the CHIPS Act won’t convince them to invest in onshore
production. Why would they? 2022 was Broadcom’s best year ever, not in
spite of its supply-chain problems, but because of them. Those problems
let Broadcom raise prices for a captive audience of customers, who the
company strong-armed into exclusivity deals that ensured they had
nowhere to turn. Qualcomm also profited handsomely from shortages,
because its customers end up paying Qualcomm no matter where they buy,
thanks to Qualcomm ensuring that its patents are integrated into global
4G and 5G standards. That means that all standards-conforming products
generate royalties for Qualcomm, and it also means that Qualcomm can
decide which companies are allowed to compete with it, and which ones
will be denied licenses to its patents. Both companies are under orders
from the FTC to cut this out, and both companies ignore the FTC. The
brittleness of mature-node and leading-edge chips is not inevitable.
Advanced memory chips (DRAM) roughly comparable in complexity to
leading-edge chips, while analog-to-digital chips are as easily
commodified as mature-node chips, and yet each has a robust and
competitive supply chain, with both onshore and offshore producers. In
contrast with leading-edge manufacturers (who have been visibly
indifferent to the CHIPS incentives), memory chip manufacturers
responded to the CHIPS Act by committing hundreds of billions of dollars
to new on-shore production facilities. Intel is a curious case: in a
world of fabless leading-edge manufacturers, Intel stands out for making
its own chips. But Intel is in a lot of trouble. Its advanced
manufacturing plans keep foundering on cost overruns and delays. The
company keeps losing money. But until recently, its management kept
handing its shareholders billions in dividends and buybacks – a sign
that Intel bosses assume that the US public will bail out its “national
champion.” It’s not clear whether the CHIPS Act can save Intel, or
whether financialization will continue to hollow out a once-dominant
pioneer. The CHIPS Act won’t undo the concentration – and
financialization – of the semiconductor industry. The industry has been
awash in cheap money since the 2008 bailouts, and in just the past five
years, US semiconductor monopolists have paid out $239b to shareholders
in buybacks and dividends, enough to fund the CHIPS Act five times over.
If you include Apple in that figure, the amount US corporations spent on
shareholder returns instead of investing in capacity rises to $698b.
Apple doesn’t want a competitive market for chips. If Apple builds its
own foundry, that just frees up capacity at TSMC that its competitors
can use to improve their products. The report has an enormous amount of
accessible, well-organized detail on these markets, and it makes a set
of key recommendations for improving the CHIPS Act and passing related
legislation to ensure that the US can once again make its own
microchips. These run a gamut from funding four new onshore foundries to
requiring companies receiving CHIPS Act money to “dual-source” their
foundries. They call for NIST and the CPO to ensure open licensing of
key patents, and for aggressive policing of anti-dumping rules for cheap
chips. They also seek a new law creating an “American Semiconductor
Supply Chain Resiliency Fee” – a tariff on chips made offshore.
Fundamentally, these recommendations seek to end the outsourcing made
possible by restrictive IP regimes, to undercut Wall Street’s power to
demand savings from offshoring, and to smash the market power of
companies like Apple that make the brittleness of chip manufacturing
into a feature, rather than a bug. This would include a return to
previous antitrust rules, which limited companies’ ability to leverage
patents into standards, and to previous IP rules, which limited
exclusive rights chip topography and design (“mask rights”). All of this
will is likely to remove the constraints that stop poor countries from
doing to America the same things that postcolonial America did to
England – that is, it will usher in an era in which lots of countries
make their own chips and other high-tech goods without paying rent to
American companies. This is good! It’s good for poor countries, who will
have more autonomy to control their own technical destiny. It’s also
good for the world, creating resiliency in the high-tech manufacturing
sector that we’ll need as the polycrisis overwhelms various places with
fire and flood and disease and war. Electrifying, solarizing and
adapting the world for climate resilience is fundamentally incompatible
with a brittle, highly concentrated tech sector. Pluralizing high-tech
production will make America less vulnerable to the gamesmanship of
other countries – and it will also make the rest of the world less
vulnerable to American bullying. As Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman
describe so beautifully in their 2023 book Underground Empire, the
American political establishment is keenly aware of how its chokepoints
over global finance and manufacturing can be leveraged to advantage the
US at the rest of the world’s expense:

Look, I know that Eisenhower didn’t trade cow-lips for alien technology
– but our political and commercial elites really did trade national
resiliency away for IP laws, and it’s a bargain that screwed everyone,
except the one percenters whose power and wealth have metastasized into
a deadly cancer that threatens the country and the planet. (Image:

<h2 id="the-messy-truth-of-americas-natural-gas-exports">The Messy Truth
of America’s Natural Gas Exports</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTM5NjE5MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MzYwODE0OH0.5Gl-Y_zZ4R-WmAw7Ey6RGhL8XwqV0dnfDN-Wo8S8b3M/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Late last month, Joe Biden made what has been hailed as one of the
biggest climate policy decisions of the past year. <br/>
</p>
<p>
He announced that the federal government would temporarily stop
approving new export terminals for liquified natural gas. The move was
celebrated as a victory by climate activists and lamented by fossil-fuel
companies; Donald Trump promised that, if elected, he will reverse the
move.
</p>
<p>
But what will the pause <em>really </em>mean for the climate? Will it
stop exports from rising in the near-term, and can we say with any
certainty whether it will make carbon emissions go up or down? How
should we even <em>think</em> about this decision?
</p>
<p>
In this inaugural episode of Shift Key, Heatmap’s new podcast, my
co-host Jesse Jenkins, an energy systems expert and professor at
Princeton University, and I unpack the president’s decision and try to
figure out what — if anything — it means for the climate.
</p>
<p>
Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<p>
<strong>Robinson Meyer:</strong> Since this news came out, I think
there’s been a lot of discussion online about whether this is
necessarily the optimal choice. Could we be using that gas to do
something else? How should we be managing it? And I just want to make a
point before we go on that this is literally what climate policy means.
</p>
<p>
There’s a sense I see from some places, which is like, well, “Is cutting
off fossil fuel exports at this very arbitrary place, the optimal
policy?” And I just want to make the point that like, number one, we are
not on an optimal policy pathway at all. And in the absence of a policy
that I think both you and I think is very unlikely to pass, which is a
globally normalized carbon price that’s imposed evenly in all
jurisdictions and is priced at a level that we can attain the 1.5C or
1.6C, whatever end temperature goal we want to achieve –
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins:</strong> Yeah, I’m going to go ahead and say
that’s unlikely.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer</strong>: Yes, in the absence of a global carbon price
that is uniformly enforced across all jurisdictions, we are going to
make suboptimal decisions. And not only are we going to make suboptimal
decisions, but we are going to stop investing in fossil fuels below what
would be economically optimal if climate change didn’t exist. That’s
literally what climate change means.
</p>
<p>
And at the same time, we are going to invest above what would be
economically optimal in all of these fossil fuels if you take climate
change into account, because that is the signal failure of global
climate policy, is that we keep plowing money into fossil fuels and
under-investing in alternatives and in scaling up alternatives. We’ve
underinvested in those things for at least 20 years. That’s a different
show about whether we’re still doing it or how much we’re still doing
it.
</p>
<p>
I just want to get into this whole discussion by saying when we talk
about whether we’re fiddling knobs in the right way, or enough this way,
or enough that way, or whether we’re taking all these things into
account, we are never going to do this perfectly. And the whole point of
climate change is at some point you just have to stop investing in the
fossil fuel system.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins</strong>: Yeah, economists call this the second best
policy or third best policy. I just call it “the real world.” We’re all
just muddling through all the time and how we’re going to make progress
or not is whether we muddled through better or worse.
</p>
<p>
So I agree, it’s theoretically helpful to think about what an
economically ideal rationalized policy would be. But we’re so far from
that world that I think the question is, “is this better than the
alternative decision you could make about this particular thing right
here?”
</p>
<p>
And hopefully, that’s the view that the Department of Energy is taking
when they think about the public interest here. It’s not like, well,
could we have had some more ideal climate policy that meant we were
doing something else over in this other part of the economy instead of
doing this?
</p>
<p>
That’s an interesting conversation to have on Twitter, but maybe not the
core of the question that the DOE and the Biden administration are
grappling with right here.

At least Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen did when describing banks with

Bancorp, a regional bank with commercial real estate loans, fell nearly
30% on Tuesday, and Moody’s downgraded the bank’s credit grade to “junk”

Europe-wide protests</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
<em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Spanish farmers have joined a wave
of protests sweeping Europe. They’re demanding more support from the EU
and their government and say they’re fed up with high costs and
stringent environmental standards. Then, thousands of Indian men have
lined up to apply for construction jobs in Israel, which relies heavily
on migrant labor — especially since revoking Palestinian work permits
since the war in Gaza.

<li>‘World’s largest carbon removal plant’ will soon be up and running
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>One to watch for this week: A Bill Gates-backed startup
called Graphyte plans to begin operations at its Arkansas carbon removal
plant by Friday,<em> E&amp;E News</em>
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=1eb9bd9465&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.
The facility, which has been dubbed the “world’s largest carbon removal
plant,” relies on biomass matter like sawdust and farming waste that, if
left to decompose, would release a lot of carbon. Graphyte wants to stop
the decomposition process by drying the waste out, shaping it into
bricks, and burying the bricks underground for years and years, thus
keeping the carbon from ever reaching the atmosphere.

the company’s process keeps the cost of carbon removal below $100 per
ton, a key benchmark for scalability. Graphyte hopes to remove 15,000
metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by the end of 2024 and
continue scaling quickly from there.

<li>UK watchdog bans ‘zero emissions’ from EV ads
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>Carmakers in the United Kingdom can no longer use the
words “zero emissions” in ads to describe their electric vehicles. The
U.K.’s advertising watchdog, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA),
says the claim is misleading for consumers because it ignores emissions
from manufacturing and charging. If carmakers want to use the term, they
must find a way to explain this nuance. The precedent-setting move is
part of a bigger crackdown on greenwashing – the ASA has also banned
misleading ads from oil groups and airlines, the <em>Financial
Times</em>
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=24bfb90a77&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.
But it comes at a time when carmakers are striving to increase their EV
sales to avoid hefty fines: As of this year, fully-electric cars must
make up at least 22% of new cars sales in the U.K. If a company misses
that target, it will be fined £15,000 for every non-compliant vehicle.
So the question is how much the words “zero emissions” really matter for
sales. BMW, for example, uses the term in Google ads. But a quick look
at Google Trends shows “EVs” (in red) is a far more popular search term
than “zero emissions” (in blue), at least in the U.K.:

<p>
As EV options flood the market, a much more reliable way to boost sales
than touting emissions reductions is by introducing cutting edge smart
features, like lidar sensors, according to

from energy think-tank Ember. In 2023, wind power generation in the bloc
surpassed that of gas plants for the first time. Compared to 2022,
fossil fuel power generation fell by almost 20% overall, with
electricity from coal plants plummeting by 26% and gas down 15%.
Greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector fell by 19% as a result,
more than the huge reduction seen during the pandemic. Ember added that
the EU’s power-sector emissions are now almost half their 2007 peak
levels. “Fossil fuels are playing a smaller role than ever as a system
with wind and solar as its backbone comes into view,” said Sarah Brown,
Ember’s Europe program director.

<p class="drop-caps">
Last year, I got two kinds of stories about offshore wind in my inbox.
One was about the industry’s struggle with inflation and higher interest
rates. The other was about rampant claims that the industry was killing
whales — an idea for which there is
<a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/marine-life-distress/frequent-questions-offshore-wind-and-whales" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">no
evidence</a>, and which was found to be
<a href="https://energyandpolicy.org/fossil-fuel-funding-anti-offshore-wind-ads/" target="_blank">spread
by groups</a> with
<a href="https://www.climatedevlab.brown.edu/anti-offshorewindnetwork" target="_blank">ties
to the fossil fuel industry</a>.
</p>
<p>
But while both narratives have set the industry back to some extent,
neither appears to have damaged public support for building wind farms
in the ocean. Americans living on the coasts largely support offshore
wind and want to see the industry continue to grow, according to a
<a href="https://climatenexus.org/poll/u-s-coastal-county-residents-support-offshore-wind-development" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new
poll</a>.
</p>
<p>
The poll was conducted in November 2023 by Climate Nexus, a climate
change strategic communications group, and Turn Forward, an offshore
wind advocacy nonprofit that says it does not receive funding from wind
farm developers.

</iframe>
</center>
<p>
A representative sample of 2,038 adults living in coastal counties along
the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and Gulf of Mexico were asked about
their views of offshore wind. More than two-thirds responded that they
support offshore wind farm construction, and 63% responded favorably
when asked specifically whether they supported offshore wind farms near
where they lived. Nearly 60% endorsed the U.S. government selling more
leases to expand the industry’s development.
</p>
<p>
Public sentiment, for the most part, was positive across party lines.
The majority of Republican respondents also said they supported offshore
wind, both in general (57%), and near where they live (52%).
</p>
<p>
A more polarizing question was whether respondents preferred offshore
wind development to expanding offshore oil and gas, with 71% of
Democrats opting for wind but only 33% of Republicans. (26% of
Republicans said they had no preference.)

</iframe>
</center>
<p>
One of the more intriguing parts of the poll tried to suss out what
people had heard and read about offshore wind, and where they were
getting information about the emerging industry. Local opposition groups
like
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/300299345115758/" target="_blank">Protect
Our Coast New Jersey</a> have developed large followings on Facebook,
where members share their fears that wind turbines will harm marine
mammals, tourism, and property values — and also argue against the basic
facts of climate change. Several grassroots groups, including Protect
Our Coast New Jersey, have been found to have financial relationships
with

fuel-funded think tanks like the Caesar Rodney Institute</a>.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Conservative outlets like Fox News have also fueled the
narrative that offshore wind development is killing whales. Media
Matters, a media watchdog,
<a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-news-aiding-fossil-fuel-funded-campaign-targeting-offshore-wind" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found</a>
that Fox has “aired at least 54 segments suggesting that offshore wind
development is causing whale deaths.” A
<a href="https://www.climatedevlab.brown.edu/anti-offshorewindnetwork" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a>
published last year by researchers at Brown University that mapped out
the networks of anti-offshore wind groups in the U.S. suggested that
social networks and conservative news outlets like Fox function as “a
feedback loop of opposition and misinformation.”

</iframe>
</center>
<p>
According to the new poll, 53% of coastal Americans have received
information about offshore wind on TV news, and 48% have seen posts
about it on social media. Those were the two top sources of information,
followed by newspapers, family and friends, and TV ads. But even so,
most respondents — 56% — said that everything they have seen, read, or
heard about offshore wind has been more positive than negative.
</p>
<p>
But while the poll may be a good temperature check on public sentiment,
it doesn’t necessarily change some of the headwinds that offshore wind
development faces. An
<a href="https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1201&context=sabin_climate_change" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">earlier
report</a> from Columbia University researchers found that local
opposition to renewable energy projects, including offshore wind
projects, is growing. The report specifically documents instances where
community groups have passed laws to block projects or filed lawsuits
against developers or local officials.
</p>
<p>
There are currently four lawsuits pending in federal court against
Vineyard Wind, a project that is already under construction, from a
group called Nantucket Residents Against Turbines. In New Jersey, at
least two communities passed resolutions last year calling on state and
federal officials to impose a moratorium on offshore wind projects,

Even if the majority of coastal citizens support an American offshore
wind industry, a vocal minority can still wield a lot of power to hold
it back — especially when they have the backing of fossil fuel money.

<h2 id="teaching-llms-to-be-deceptive">Teaching LLMs to Be
Deceptive</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, updated: 2024-02-06, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Interesting research:
“<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2401.05566v3">Sleeper Agents: Training
Deceptive LLMs that Persist Through Safety Training</a>“:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b> Humans are capable of strategically deceptive behavior:
behaving helpfully in most situations, but then behaving very
differently in order to pursue alternative objectives when given the
opportunity. If an AI system learned such a deceptive strategy, could we
detect it and remove it using current state-of-the-art safety training
techniques? To study this question, we construct proof-of-concept
examples of deceptive behavior in large language models (LLMs). For
example, we train models that write secure code when the prompt states
that the year is 2023, but insert exploitable code when the stated year
is 2024. We find that such backdoor behavior can be made persistent, so
that it is not removed by standard safety training techniques, including
supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and adversarial training
(eliciting unsafe behavior and then training to remove it). The backdoor
behavior is most persistent in the largest models and in models trained
to produce chain-of-thought reasoning about deceiving the training
process, with the persistence remaining even when the chain-of-thought
is distilled away. Furthermore, rather than removing backdoors, we find
that adversarial training can teach models to better recognize their
backdoor triggers, effectively hiding the unsafe behavior. Our results
suggest that, once a model exhibits deceptive behavior, standard
techniques could fail to remove such deception and create a false
impression of safety…

I have a podcast about Solarpunk for writers called Solarpunk Prompts.
It’s about halfway through season 2. The episode released today is
called <strong>The Tower</strong>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Displaced people are moved into a new sustainable climate-controlled
tower designed to help them find community. For some it’s a dream come
true, for others a culture shock. How will this setting come to life as
a vision for a Solarpunk future? How can we envision a better way of
living by focusing on their humanity?
</p>

class="ellipsis">podcast.tomasino.org/<span class="citation"
data-cites="Solarpun">@Solarpun</span></span><span
class="invisible">kPrompts/episodes/the-tower</span></a>
</p>
<p>
The podcast is based around the idea of providing a new writing prompt
each episode that explores some of the themes of the Solarpunk genre and
activist movement. We discuss some inspirations, considerations, and
various ways to tell the story.
</p>
<p>
While the subject matter is focused on writing, the audience is quite
diverse. Many non-writers enjoy it simply to learn more about Solarpunk
in general.
</p>
<p>
Have a listen! You can find it at the link above, or by searching in
your favorite podcast app. If you don’t know what Solarpunk is at all,
you might try listening to Episode 1 of Season 1 for an overview of the
genre and movement, and the reasons why this podcast came into being.
</p>
<p>
Most episodes are around 10 minutes long. The Tower is our longest at
just over 16 minutes.

id="nikki-haley-trounced-by-none-of-these-candidates-in-nevada-republican-primary">Nikki
Haley Trounced by ‘None of These Candidates’ in Nevada Republican
Primary</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LAS VEGAS — Nikki Haley was swamped Tuesday in Nevada’s symbolic
Republican presidential primary as GOP voters resoundingly picked the
“none of these candidates” option on the ballot in a repudiation of the
former U.N. ambassador who is the last remaining major rival to
front-runner Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Trump, the former president, didn’t compete in the primary, which
doesn’t award any delegates needed to win the GOP nomination. He’s
instead focused on caucuses that will be held Thursday and will help him
move closer to becoming the Republican standard-bearer.</p>
<p>That leaves the Republican results on Tuesday technically
meaningless. But they still amount to an embarrassment for Haley, who
has sought to position herself as a candidate who can genuinely compete
against Trump. Instead, she became the first presidential candidate from
either party to lose a race to “none of these candidates” since that
option was introduced in Nevada in 1975.</p>
<p>Haley had said beforehand she was going to “focus on the states that
are fair” and did not campaign in the western state in the weeks leading
up to the caucuses. Her campaign wrote off the primary results with a
reference to Nevada’s famous casino industry.</p>
<p>“Even Donald Trump knows that when you play penny slots the house
wins,” spokeswoman Olivia Perez-Cubas said. “We didn’t bother to play a
game rigged for Trump. We’re full steam ahead in South Carolina and
beyond.”</p>
<p>Trump joked on his social media network, “Watch, she’ll soon claim
Victory!”</p>
<p>Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican, had announced beforehand that
he would vote for “none of these candidates” on Tuesday. Several
Republicans interviewed heading to the polls said they intended to do
the same.</p>
<p>Washoe County Republican Party Chair Bruce Parks, who pushed for the
GOP to hold caucuses, said that he told voters who called his office —
and Trump supporters — to participate in the primary by voting for “none
of these candidates” over Haley.</p>
<p>“They basically told us they don’t care about us,” Parks said in an
interview after the race was called. “By marking ‘none of these
candidates,’ we respond in kind — we don’t care about you either.”</p>
<p>The Associated Press declared “None of these candidates” the winner
at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday based on initial vote results that showed it
with a significant lead over Haley in seven counties across the state,
including in the two most populous counties.</p>
<p>There was also a Democratic primary on Tuesday that President Joe
Biden easily won against author Marianne Williamson and a handful of
less-known challengers. Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota was not on the
ballot.</p>
<p>Biden issued a statement thanking Nevada voters for their support
and, with an eye toward an expected matchup in November, warned that
Trump is trying to divide America.</p>
<p>“I want to thank the voters of Nevada for sending me and Kamala
Harris to the White House four years ago, and for setting us one step
further on that same path again tonight. We must organize, mobilize, and
vote. Because one day, when we look back, we’ll be able to say, when
American democracy was a risk, we saved it — together,” Biden said.</p>
<p>Nevada lawmakers added “none of these candidates” as an option in all
statewide races as a way post-Watergate for voters to participate but
express dissatisfaction with their choices. “None” can’t win an elected
office, but it came in first in primary congressional contests in 1976
and 1978. It also finished ahead of both George Bush and Edward Kennedy
in Nevada’s 1980 presidential primaries.</p>
<p>The caucuses on Thursday are the only Nevada contest that count
toward the GOP’s presidential nomination. But they were seen as
especially skewed in favor of Trump because of the intense grassroots
support they require from candidates and new state party rules that
benefitted him further.</p>
<p>Trump is expected to handily win the caucuses, which should deliver
him all 26 of the state’s delegates. Delegates are party members,
activists and elected officials who vote at the national party
conventions to formally select the party’s nominee.</p>
<p>“If your goal is to win the Republican nomination for president, you
go where the delegates are. And it baffles me that Nikki Haley chose not
to participate,” Trump’s senior campaign adviser Chris LaCivita said in
an interview before the primary.</p>
<p>Nevada, the third state in the field after Iowa and New Hampshire,
was set to hold a state-run primary election instead of party-run
caucuses after Democrats controlling the Legislature changed the law to
try to boost participation.</p>
<p>Caucuses typically require voters to show up for an in-person meeting
at a certain day or time, while elections can offer more flexibility to
participate, with polls open for most of the day on Election Day, along
with absentee or early voting.</p>
<p>But Nevada Republicans chose to hold party-run caucuses instead,
saying they wanted certain rules in place, like a requirement that
participants show a government-issued ID.</p>
<p>The caucuses require a candidate to intensely organize supporters
around the state to be competitive, a feat that Trump, the former
president and prohibitive front-runner, was easily positioned to do.</p>
<p>The Nevada GOP also restricted the involvement of super PACs like the
one Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was relying on to boost his now-suspended
campaign. And the party barred candidates from appearing both on the
primary ballot and in the caucuses.</p>
<p>Former Vice President Mike Pence and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott
also signed up to compete in Nevada’s primary instead of the caucuses
before ending their presidential campaigns.</p>

Bening Honored as Harvard’s Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — Annette Bening, a two-time Golden Globe winner who
recently received her fifth Oscar nomination, was feted Tuesday with a
raucous parade full of colorful costumes and drag performers as part of
festivities honoring her as Harvard University’s Hasty Pudding
Theatricals 2024 Woman of the Year.</p>
<p>A few hours later, Benning endured a celebrity roast before attending
a performance of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ 175th production, “Heist
Heist Baby.”</p>
<p>She joined a group of synchronized swimmers on stage doing swim
strokes to the song “Pump Up the Jams,” a reference to her role in the
swimming movie “Nyad.” Then, she cut the hair of a volunteer in an
effort to give him her signature look. And then she donned a seagull
costume and acted out the role of the sea bird, a reference her role in
the movie version of Anton Chekhov’s “The Seagull,” squawking and
waiving her arms.</p>
<p>“I did it all myself with no one’s help,” Benning joked, after
accepting the traditional pudding pot and trying to start a speech by
thanking her kindergarten teacher. Her husband, Warren Beatty, won the
man of the year award in 1975.</p>
<p>The Pudding is the oldest theatrical organization in the nation and
one of the oldest in the world. Since 1951, it has bestowed this award
annually on women “who have made lasting and impressive contributions to
the world of entertainment.” Other winners have included Meryl Streep,
Julia Roberts, Scarlett Johansson and Jennifer Coolidge.</p>
<p>Festivities began with the parade at Harvard. Bening, wearing a brown
coat, hat and sunglasses, blew kisses to the crowd, and at one point,
was pecked on both cheeks by drag performers. As the parade ended, she
launched into a can-can dance with several other people.</p>
<p>“We’re absolutely thrilled to honor Annette Bening in this milestone
175th anniversary year for the Hasty Pudding,” said Josh Hillers, the
organization’s president. “Hot off her Oscars nomination for Best
Actress, we’re excited to present her with the most prestigious award in
the entertainment industry.”</p>
<p>Bening, who also has won a Screen Actors Guild Award and starred in
“The Grifters” and “American Beauty,” earned her fifth Oscar nomination,
this one for best actress, for playing the prickly long-distance swimmer
Diana Nyad in the movie “Nyad.”</p>
<p>Barry Keoghan, best known for his roles in “Saltburn,” “Dunkirk,”
“The Killing of a Sacred Deer,” “Eternals” and “The Banshees of
Inisherin,” is the recipient of its 2024 Man of the Year Award. He will
be honored Friday night.</p>

Celebrates Black History Amid African Americans’ Anger Over Gaza</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden celebrated Black History Month
Tuesday at the White House amid slipping support from Black voters
distressed by the administration’s stance on the war in Gaza and
disillusioned by what they see as a lack of progress on Biden’s racial
justice agenda.</p>
<p>“Tonight, let’s reflect on how we make history, not erase history,”
Biden said Tuesday evening, taking a jab at Republican-controlled state
legislatures that have introduced bills that would limit what schools
can teach about race and American Black history.</p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris, who spoke before Biden, was more
direct.</p>
<p>“Across our nation, we have witnessed extremists try to erase our
history,” she said during the White House reception with Black leaders.
“They censor history textbooks and cancel history classes.”</p>
<p>In a statement, the White House touted legislative victories and
executive orders promoting racial equity that has seen a 60% increase in
Black wealth since the pandemic, record levels of entrepreneurship, and
significant reductions in child poverty. They highlighted support for
Black-owned businesses, expanded access to affordable housing, improved
educational opportunities and efforts to address health care and
educational disparities.</p>
<p>Yet polls suggest support for the president among Black voters is
slipping. A USA Today/Suffolk University poll released in January shows
Biden carrying the support of just 63% of Black voters, a steep decline
from the 87% he had in 2020.</p>
<p>Troubled by Gaza</p>
<p>As images of death and destruction in Gaza mobilized activists, a
coalition of more than 1,000 Black faith leaders pressed Biden to call
for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas.</p>
<p>The campaign grew organically from the congregation, said the
Rev. Timothy McDonald III, one of the first pastors who signed the open
letter.</p>
<p>“They pushed us to make that statement,” said McDonald, founder of
the African American Ministers Leadership Council and senior pastor of
the First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
<p>“Young people were saying, ‘You’re all supposed to be faith leaders,
and you’re doing nothing about all of this?’” McDonald told VOA. He
noted that just as with the civil rights movement, the distress and
anger felt by younger parishioners quickly spread to older members of
the congregation.</p>
<p>Community leaders say that Black Americans who support Palestinian
rights see the conflict through the lens of racial justice, with the
solidarity of a minority group that knows how it feels to be oppressed,
displaced and deprived.</p>
<p>Steve Phillips, author and founder of Democracy in Color, a political
media organization, pointed to Martin Luther King Jr.’s 1967 “A Time to
Break Silence” speech. In it, King denounced U.S. involvement in the
Vietnam War as morally unjust and said it diverted Americans’ attention
from racism and poverty at home.</p>
<p>“There’s just so much resonance and similarity to this same kind of a
moment,” Phillips told VOA.”</p>
<p>Responding to international and domestic pressures, Biden has shown a
more sympathetic tone toward Palestinians, saying last week he sees “the
trauma, the death and destruction,” and understands “the pain and
passion felt by so many here in America and around the world.”</p>
<p>The administration says a permanent cease-fire will only benefit
Hamas at this point. But it is pushing for a deal that would secure a
temporary halt in fighting in return for the release of Israeli hostages
held by Hamas and release of Palestinians in Israeli prisons.</p>
<p>Waning enthusiasm</p>
<p>Even before the October 7 Hamas attack, there were signs of waning
Black enthusiasm for Biden and frustration over the lack of progress on
issues that emerged alongside the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>
<p>“There was a fairly high-profile announcement about efforts to look
at racial justice when the president first came in. And then you never
heard much follow-up after that,” Phillips said.</p>
<p>A bill designed to ensure that minority voters can participate
equally in the electoral process, and a bill to prevent racial profiling
by law enforcement have been languishing in Congress. </p>
<p>Only 50% of Black adults said they approve of Biden in a December
AP-NORC poll, down from 86% in July 2021. Biden’s opponent is eager to
capitalize.</p>
<p>“Joe Biden no longer has a base,” said Karoline Leavitt, national
press secretary for the campaign of leading Republican nominee and
former President Donald Trump. </p>
<p>“Key Democrat constituencies, such as African Americans, Hispanic
Americans and women, are supporting President Trump because they are
sick and tired of Crooked Joe’s record-high inflation, open borders,
crime and chaos,” she told VOA.</p>
<p>With most polls showing Biden having a comfortable lead over Trump
among Black voters, the bigger threat is not Black voters shifting to
Trump but low voter turnout that could sway results in the most
competitive states, including Georgia, Pennsylvania and Michigan.</p>
<p>Disinformation</p>
<p>Efforts to discourage voters of color from going to the polls are
being fueled by voter suppression efforts, including through social
media disinformation, said Atiba Ellis, a professor at Case Western
Reserve University School of Law.</p>
<p>“This has a long history,” Ellis told VOA, pointing to intimidation
in the 1860s by white supremacist groups to prevent recently freed
enslaved people from participating in the political process and Jim Crow
laws in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that prevented Black
people from voting.</p>
<p>A source close to the Biden campaign, who asked not to be identified
as is customary when discussing electoral strategy, said the campaign is
combating disinformation with “early and substantial investments,”
including $25 million in television and digital ad spending in August in
top battleground states focusing on Black and Hispanic media.</p>
<p>“Making sure that the right and the correct information is out
there,” the source said. “That’s how we can better combat the wrong
information, with the right information.”</p>
<p>Black Americans, a group the president calls the “backbone of the
Democratic Party,” number about 34.4 million and account for 14.0% of
eligible voters in November, according to Pew Research Center
projections.</p>

Billion Bipartisan Security Agreement in Jeopardy in US Senate</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden is calling on lawmakers to support the U.S.
Senate’s $118 billion bipartisan agreement on border security that would
also provide aid to Israel and Ukraine. But a growing number of
Republicans say they plan to withhold their support for the measure.

how WhatsApp plans to interoperate with other messaging apps</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>As noted by Wired, WhatsApp wants the messaging services it connects
with to use the same Signal Protocol to encrypt messages. Meta is also
open to apps using alternate encryption protocols so long as companies
can prove “they reach the security standards that WhatsApp outlines in
its guidance.” The third-party services will also have to sign a
contract with Meta before they plug into WhatsApp, with more details
about the agreement coming in March. ↫ Emma Roth at The Verge They way
this should work is that these megacorporations create free and open
APIs any instant messaging application can tap into. I’m not looking to
bring other services into WhatsApp; I’m looking to bring all services
together in one unified application that respects my platform’s
conventions and integrates properly with the operating systems I use. I
feel like this contractual interoperability Facebook (and Apple) is
offering is not interoperability at all, and does not reflect the spirit
of the Digital Markets Act.</p>
