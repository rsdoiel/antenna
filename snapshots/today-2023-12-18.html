Supreme Court Justice O’Connor honored as a trailblazer</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-18, from: San Jose Mercury News</p>
<p>O’Connor was nominated in 1981 by President Ronald Reagan and
confirmed by the Senate, ending 191 years of male exclusivity on the
high court. A rancher’s daughter who was largely unknown on the national
scene until her appointment, she received more letters than any other
member in the court’s history in her first year and would come to be
referred to by commentators as the nation’s most powerful woman.</p>

Lawmakers Still Negotiating Ukraine Aid Deal as Holidays Near</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Capitol Hill — The U.S. Congress is running out of time to pass a new
aid package for Ukraine, as Senate lawmakers worked through the weekend
to negotiate a deal for border security funding in return for Republican
votes.   </p>
<p>The United States has already dedicated more than $100 billion to
arming and supporting Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale
invasion in February 2022, and President Joe Biden has asked Congress to
approve another $60 billion. However, Republicans in Congress have
become increasingly skeptical about the need to continue underwriting
Ukraine’s defense. </p>
<p>In recent weeks, Republicans in the Senate have conditioned approval
of any additional money for Ukraine on the simultaneous strengthening of
immigration rules aimed at reducing the number of people entering the
U.S. at its southern border and expelling some who are already in the
country. </p>
<p>A small group of lawmakers from the two parties, along with
representatives from the Biden administration, are trying to hammer out
an agreement that can gain enough support from both sides to protect it
from that body’s various legislative pitfalls. </p>
<p>The U.S. Senate had been scheduled to hold its last day in session
for this year last Thursday but adjusted the schedule to allow for time
for further negotiations. The House of Representatives went out of
session for the rest of the year but could be called back to vote if a
deal is reached.  </p>
<p>As of Monday morning, lawmakers still had not agreed on legislation
and a vote appeared increasingly unlikely.  </p>
<p>House wants more </p>
<p>Even if an agreement passes in the Senate, it likely would not
survive in the House, where Republicans hold a very narrow majority. A
significant group of Republican House members opposes additional aid to
Ukraine, and the party recently voted out a speaker who partnered with
Democrats to pass legislation. </p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson, who took over after predecessor Kevin
McCarthy was ousted, has said that more funding for the border is
essential to any Ukrainian aid package; however, he also wants more
conditions placed on the aid. </p>
<p>“What the Biden administration seems to be asking for is billions of
additional dollars with no appropriate oversight, no clear strategy to
win, and none of the answers that I think the American people are owed,”
he said this week. </p>
<p>EU aid blocked; Putin celebrates </p>
<p>Worries about continued U.S. funding for Ukraine sharpened Friday
after another key source of support was shut down. With the European
Union considering a package of aid worth more than $50 billion,
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban used his veto to scuttle the
plan. </p>
<p>Orban’s vote came just a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin
publicly celebrated the fact that Ukraine appears to be losing support
in the West. </p>
<p>“Ukraine today produces nearly nothing; they are trying to preserve
something, but they don’t produce practically anything themselves and
bring everything in for free,” he said, according to The Associated
Press. “But the freebies may end at some point and apparently it’s
coming to an end little by little.” </p>
<p>While opponents of aid to Ukraine often denigrate aid packages as
being a “blank check” handed over to the Ukrainian government, most of
the aid is in the form of military hardware. The dollar figures in the
aid packages mostly represent money spent in the U.S. to pay arms
manufacturers for the equipment the U.S. ships to Ukraine. </p>
<p>There is little doubt that a significant delay in additional funding
from the U.S. would adversely impact Ukraine on the battlefield, but
experts differed on the question of how long it would take before the
effects become apparent. </p>
<p>“My current understanding is that there’s sufficient money remaining
in the presidential drawdown authority for the Biden administration to
continue sending arms to Ukraine for several more weeks, so into
January,” said Nicholas Lokker, a research associate in the Center for a
New American Security’s Transatlantic Security Program. “Once you start
getting into January, the money is going to start running out.” </p>
<p>Lokker said that Ukraine is already experiencing shortages of
artillery shells and air defense munitions, and that a cutoff or
significant delay in aid from the U.S. would exacerbate those
shortages. </p>
<p>Giving Russia time </p>
<p>Gian Gentile, a retired U.S. Army colonel and now a senior historian
with the RAND Corporation, said that he thinks a delay in U.S. funding
might take a little longer, perhaps months, to become apparent on the
battlefield. </p>
<p>Gentile, however, said a significant delay, or reduction in U.S.
support, could have a major impact on the dynamics of the war. </p>
<p>“If it’s such an extended delay that Ukraine has to really pull back
on the amount of artillery it’s using and goes completely on the
defensive, that gives Russia time and space,” he told VOA. “If they’re
taking fewer casualties, that allows the Russians to spend more time on
training, rebuilding and getting ready for another offensive.”</p>

Next Front in Climate Activism Is De-Privatizing Utilities</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-18, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDMxMDk0OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczNDU1OTY5N30.vieSDMe7h41Lb69y5dngEYBEgsQSotUTs475DMAKfkU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Voters in Maine were confronted with an unusual decision when they went
to the polls this November. Question three on the ballot asked Mainers
if they wanted to eliminate the two private utilities that delivered
electricity to 97% of the state. A new, nonprofit utility called Pine
Tree Power would take over the service, and it would be overseen by a
publicly-elected board.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Though the proposal may sound radical, it’s not unheard of. Since the
dawn of the electric grid, communities have periodically decided to
municipalize their utilities. The city of Sacramento, California, took
over PG&amp;E’s local electric distribution franchise in 1946. Winter
Park, Florida, took over electric service from a company called Progress
Energy in 2005. But a takeover at the state level has only been
attempted by Nebraska, where the entire state’s
<a href="https://www.nepower.org/public-power/history.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">electric
service went public in the 1940s</a> and has remained that way ever
since.
</p>
<p>
Unlike in Nebraska, the campaign in Maine failed. Seventy percent of
voters said “no” to question three. But the ballot measure wasn’t a
one-off. This year marked a renewed push for public power that’s growing
around the country in light of the challenges of tackling climate
change.
</p>
<p>
Investor-owned utilities have used their vast financial resources and
political influence to
<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac8ab3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">delay
and block the transition off of fossil fuels</a>, in ways large and
small, for decades. Activists, tired of trying to work within that
system, are turning their attention to what they see as the more
systemic root cause — the perverse incentives created by having
utilities that need to turn a profit.
</p>
<p>
Americans often refer to their electricity or gas providers as “public
utilities.” But only about 15% of the population is served by a
government-owned, customer-owned, or member-owned electric utility. The
other 85% are beholden to private companies that were granted monopolies
to sell electricity decades ago.
</p>
<p>
What started as a smattering of independent campaigns to change that
ratio started to coalesce into a nationally coordinated movement this
year. A few weeks before the vote on the ballot measure, some 70
delegates from about 40 grassroots climate groups from around the
country convened for a workshop at the Press Hotel in Portland, Maine.
For three days, they exchanged notes and strategies for how to get
public power on the agenda in their own cities and states, and reform
public utilities in places that already had them. By the end, they had
cemented a more energized, organized coalition.
</p>
<p>
The guiding theory behind the push for public power is that public
utilities don’t need to generate returns for shareholders, theoretically
enabling them to make investments guided by other priorities, like
reducing emissions — and charge customers less in the process.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve seen time and time again that the market is not going to correct
this,” Greg Woodring, a workshop participant from Ann Arbor, Michigan,
told me. “Public power gives us the ability to choose where our energy
is coming from, the ability to directly make that change without having
to ask or plead or beg or incentivize a corporate entity that, at the
end of the day, is only making a decision based on what’s going to make
the most profit possible.”
</p>
<p>
But public power is divisive in the larger climate movement. While not
necessarily ideologically opposed, critics are concerned about wasting
time and money. Private utilities don’t go without a fight, and
communities can get bogged down in legal battles for years. The city of
Boulder, Colorado, famously tried to wrest control over its electric
service from the utility Xcel for a decade, and gave up.
</p>
<p>
In Maine, the Conservation Law Foundation, a prominent environmental
group,
<a href="https://www.clf.org/blog/is-pine-tree-power-too-risky-for-maine/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warned</a>
that the cost of a transition to public power was too uncertain, that it
could mire the state in litigation, and that having a publicly-elected
board could subject critical energy decisions to “partisan political
maneuvering.” Instead, the group made a case for strengthening laws and
regulations. However, it also conceded that if the utilities don’t meet
metrics of affordability and sustainability they should face stiffer
fines, or even lose their ability to operate in the state.
</p>
<p>
Defenders of investor-owned utilities argue that they have advantages
over nonprofits when it comes to building the clean grid of the future.
“The investor-owned business model enables companies to raise and deploy
massive amounts of capital in an efficient and cost-effective manner,
and their purchasing power helps to minimize costs to customers,” said
Sarah Durdaller, a spokesperson for the Edison Electric Institute, a
trade group for private electric utilities. She told me that the
organization’s members’ “commitment to delivering resilient clean energy
to our customers has never been stronger, and our focus on affordability
has never been more important.”
</p>
<p>
The Maine campaign was not the first time a shift to publicly-owned
utilities has been pitched as a climate strategy. One of the main
motivations for Boulder’s effort, which started in 2010, was Xcel’s
unwillingness to help the city meet its climate goals. But the increased
momentum behind public power in 2023 signaled a new direction for
climate activism more broadly, which had seemed to stagnate after the
rise and fall of the youth-led Sunrise Movement and the election of Joe
Biden.
</p>
<p>
“This is a site where we can practice democracy,” Isaac Sevier, one of
the workshop organizers, told me. “I think that’s something that
energizes people, it gives them more hope, it gives them something to be
a part of and fight for and struggle for in a time when so many people
are turning away.”
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
The workshop in Maine was convened by a handful of national
organizations, including the Climate and Community Project, a
progressive think tank, Lead Locally, a group that works to elect
progressive candidates, and the Democratic Socialists of America’s Green
New Deal Campaign Commission.
</p>
<p>
The DSA has been a major force behind the recent surge in interest in
public power. At the start of this year, it kicked off a new campaign
called “Building for Power” focused on trying to strengthen public
institutions at the local level. In addition to public power, DSA is
advocating for green public housing and transit, and improved public
spaces.
</p>
<p>
“We want to rebuild, and in some cases, build anew, public sector
capacity,” Matt Haugen, one of the organizers of the workshop, told me.
“Through decades of neoliberalism, the public sector has been hollowed
out in the U.S., and we’re seeing in all these areas that it’s clear the
private sector just cannot meet these human needs.”
</p>
<p>
Many of the participants at the workshop were DSA members, but there
were also local organizers affiliated with national environmental
organizations, like 350 and the Sierra Club, and others from smaller,
grassroots groups. There was a freshman in college, a seasoned activist
in his 80s, and many ages represented in between. While almost everyone
there was from a left-leaning city, they hailed from every corner of the
country, including California, Montana, Michigan, Tennessee, Puerto
Rico, and Washington, D.C.
</p>
<p>
Some, like Woodring of Ann Arbor, were from cities that were already in
the early stages of considering a public power takeover. His group had
convinced the city council to complete a feasibility study on
municipalization. Others, like Marta Meengs, from Missoula, Montana,
were trying to figure out how to win smaller battles, like the right to
have community-owned solar farms. Others wanted to reform existing
public power agencies, like Amy Kelly from Tennessee, where the
federally-owned Tennessee Valley Authority runs the grid — but is
investing heavily in natural gas, and offers few avenues for civic
engagement.
</p>
<p>
One such group had already seen some success. The New York chapter of
the DSA passed the Build Public Renewables Act earlier this year after
four years of campaigning. The law directs the New York Power Authority,
an existing state-owned power provider, to shut down all of its fossil
fuel plants by the end of 2031, and expands its mandate to include
building renewable energy projects. Most residential customers in New
York are actually served by private utilities, but proponents saw the
law as a way to get more clean energy built, faster, and with high labor
and equity standards.
</p>
<p>
The Inflation Reduction Act, the climate law signed by President Biden
last year, is one reason the tides turned for the New York campaign. It
enabled government agencies and nonprofits to take advantage of tax
credits for renewable energy projects for the first time, improving the
economics of public power.
</p>
<p>
“It really opens up a huge amount of additional space for public power
to be a part of the answer,” Johanna Bozuwa, executive director of the
Climate and Community Project, told me.
</p>
<p>
Though few of the participants had ever met or even heard of each
others’ campaigns, the stories that led them to advocate for public
power shared a number of common themes: Worsening power outages due to
extreme weather. Alarm over the insufficient pace of emission
reductions. Outrageously high bills. But perhaps most of all,
frustration with constantly coming up against utilities wielding money
and influence to fight clean energy.
</p>
<p>
Woodring, of Ann Arbor, cited a
<a href="https://energyandpolicy.org/dte-energy-political-contributions-michigan/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2022
analysis</a> that found that more than 90% of sitting legislators in
Michigan at the time took money from groups and individuals affiliated
with DTE, the biggest utility in the state. The company was also tied to
more than $200,000 in donations to Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who’s
responsible for appointing the state’s utility regulators. As a result,
according to the workshop participants from Michigan, the company has
been able to restrict the growth of residential solar, which would eat
into its profits.
</p>
<p>
Mikal Goodman, a 23-year-old city councilmember from Pontiac, Michigan,
told me his interest in public power stemmed from DTE’s high rates and
failure to invest in modernizing its transmission system. Some of its
poles and wires dated back to before World War II, he said. Last winter,
storms knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of households in
southeast Michigan, leaving some families in the dark for over a week.
But the day after one especially bad storm in February that left 450,000
people without power, DTE’s CEO Gerardo Norcia
<a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/business-watch/dte-energy-cut-operations-meet-profits-months-power-outages" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bragged
to Wall Street analysts</a> about the company’s “strong financial
results” due to budget cuts and delayed maintenance.
</p>
<p>
In Pontiac, Goodman said, outages are life-threatening. He described the
city as a donut hole — a poor, majority minority community surrounded by
much wealthier, whiter towns. Most Pontiac residents don’t have the
resources to run backup generators, replace rotting food, or flee to
hotels if they need to, like many of their well-off neighbors, he said.
</p>
<p>
The idea that energy is a human right, and should not be treated as a
commodity, came up repeatedly at the workshop. Many of the participants
were drawn to public power by the desire to see an energy transition
that benefits everyone, not just those who can afford clean energy.
</p>
<p>
Sevier, who has done a lot of work related to decarbonizing buildings,
was frustrated that other advocates in the field were ignoring the
growing energy affordability crisis. One in six households are behind on
their utility bills,
<a href="https://neada.org/energy-affordability-project/" target="_blank">according
to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association</a>, and gas and
electric utilities are increasingly disconnecting customers that are in
arrears. A January
<a href="https://bailoutwatch.org/analysis/powerless-in-the-united-states-utility-shutoffs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report
from Bailout Watch</a>, a nonprofit watchdog of fossil fuel companies,
estimated that the 12 utilities that perpetrated the vast majority of
shutoffs between 2020 and the fall of 2022 could have forgiven the debt
with just 1% of their spending on shareholder dividends.
</p>
<p>
“If we require that everything in your life become electric, but at the
same time, we don’t transform a system that guarantees that everyone
actually can have electricity,” Sevier told me, “then I ask, who are we
building this ‘electrify everything’ system for?”
</p>
<p>
Other advocates questioned a system where the public is often forced to
pay for a company’s mistakes, but which the public has no say over.
Travis Gibrael, an organizer with a group called Reclaim Our Power in
northern California, which is working on a public takeover of PG&amp;E,
described the hypocrisy of the state’s relationship with the company.
Governor Gavin Newsom’s administration
<a href="https://calmatters.org/environment/wildfires/2020/03/california-pge-bankruptcy-gavin-newsom-deal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">helped
the company emerge from bankruptcy</a> after it was found responsible
for wildfires that destroyed whole towns and killed more than 100
people. Now the company is
<a href="https://www.kqed.org/science/1985398/california-regulators-set-to-vote-on-pges-newest-rate-increase-plan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raising
rates by 13%</a> to pay for wildfire prevention measures like burying
power lines.
</p>
<p>
“They burn down the state, they kill a bunch of people. And yet all of
those liabilities are just put on us, including the people who lost
family members,” Gibrael told me. “It’s like, we’re already paying for
the cost of the system and all the crises that are coming from it. So
for us to just own it, because we’re already paying for it, makes
sense.”
</p>
<p>
Reclaim Our Power has allies in the city government of San Francisco,
which is in the early stages of trying to
<a href="https://www.sfexaminer.com/forum/sfpuc-gm-says-its-time-for-sf-to-break-ties-with-pge/article_5451e5c8-62e5-11ee-af4d-97962d46dc1b.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">purchase
the local electric grid from PG&amp;E</a>.
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
In some ways, Maine seemed to be an ideal testing ground for such
sweeping reforms. Central Maine Power and Versant, the two private
electric companies in Maine that would have been ousted, are
consistently rated the worst for customer satisfaction in the Northeast.
CMP has faced multiple investigations and fines over its billing system,
customer service, and delays connecting new solar projects to the grid.
Mainers additionally hate the company due to a controversial power line
it is building to deliver hydropower from Canada into the U.S.
</p>
<p>
Advocates also appealed to nationalist views by highlighting the fact
that both companies have “foreign owners,” and that they are funneling
ratepayer dollars out of the country rather than back into Maine’s
communities. (CMP is owned by Iberdrola, a Spanish company. Versant is
owned by Enmax, a Canadian company owned by the city of Calgary.)
</p>
<p>
Public power advocates attributed their loss largely to the nearly $40
million the incumbent utilities spent fighting the campaign. “They
outspent us 37 to one,” Lucy Hochschartner, the deputy campaign manager
for Pine Tree Power, told me. “We were persuading people one by one, as
they were getting absolutely inundated by messaging on the television,
in their mailbox, on the radio, over digital.”
</p>
<p>
But she also said the campaign was successful in that it got a lot more
people talking about the issue — it made national headlines for weeks —
which could make it easier for future campaigns.
</p>
<p>
Reflecting on the loss, John Qua, a campaign manager at Lead Locally,
told me it showed that running a ballot initiative is probably one of
the most difficult ways to win public power. Another path is to try and
win an electoral majority to enact legislation. “While it takes longer,
you can cement a stronger, usually progressive majority in support,” he
said
</p>
<p>
Workshop attendees were clear-eyed about the fact that public ownership
would not, in itself, be a silver bullet. They were quick to acknowledge
the shortcomings of many existing public institutions, and that a
publicly-owned utility will only be as strong as public participation in
elections and decision making — a tall order when so few people today
even understand the basics about where their energy comes from. Grace
Brown, a researcher at the University of Glasgow in Scotland who studies
public power movements, said it’s a much harder proposition in the U.S.
than in Europe, where people are used to relying on the government for
services, and socialism isn’t such a dirty word.
</p>
<p>
“That’s not just about winning votes, it’s about changing the mindset of
this whole country,” she told me. “It’s trying to change these huge
ideological ideas of how this country understands what the state should
be and what the government should do.”
</p>
<p>
Public power isn’t the only idea out there for breaking the inertia and
corporate capture of the energy system. This year, Colorado,
Connecticut, and Maine
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/06/21/three-states-just-barred-utilities-charging-customers-lobbying/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">passed
laws</a> that will prevent utilities from charging ratepayers for their
lobbying efforts.
<a href="https://rmi.org/states-move-swiftly-on-performance-based-regulation-to-achieve-policy-priorities/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Several
states</a> are experimenting with new, performance-based regulations,
whereby utilities’ compensation is tied to specific goals, including
emission reductions.
</p>
<p>
There’s also evidence that the existing channels for democratic
engagement with the energy system aren’t totally broken. California and
Michigan both recently made big strides on the climate and equity issues
that public power advocates care about. This summer, the
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/06/01/should-your-electricity-bills-depend-how-much-money-you-make/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Golden
State passed a law</a> requiring utilities to design progressive rates
tied to customers’ incomes.
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/michigan-climate-laws-gretchen-whitmer-democrats-senate-bill-0271-0273-0502-0519" target="_self">Michigan
passed a law</a> requiring utilities to use 100% clean energy by 2040.
</p>
<p>
The revitalized push for public power is about more than clean energy.
To proponents, it’s about shaping this new, green energy system in a way
that benefits a wider public. Whether or not they see more victories,
the questions they are raising about who decides when and how we
transition to this hypothetical clean energy future are already
infiltrating the wider climate discussion. And as past public power
movements, like the one in Boulder, have shown, even when the campaigns
fail, the threat they pose to utilities is usually enough to get the
companies to change their approach.
</p>
<p>
If there’s one thing I took away from the workshop, it’s that the
movement is just getting started. Expect to see more high-profile
campaigns — perhaps in San Francisco or Ann Arbor — in the coming years.

Debbie Urbanski’s ‘After World’ (18 Dec 2023)</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-18, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Debbie Urbanski’s ‘After World’: An unflinching, bleak,
vivid tale of humanity’s final days. Hey look at this: Delights to
delectate. This day in history: 2008, 2013, 2018, 2022 Colophon: Recent
publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects,
current reading Debbie Urbanski’s ‘After World’ (permalink) Debbie
Urbanski’s debut novel After World is an unflinching and relentlessly
bleak tale of humanity’s mass extinction, shot through with pathos and
veined with seams of tragic tenderness and care:
https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/After-World/Debbie-Urbanski/9781668023457
I first encountered Urbanski in “An Incomplete Timeline of What We
Tried,” an experimental short story on Motherboard’s brilliant Terraform
science fiction portal:
https://www.vice.com/en/article/xwvgeq/an-incomplete-timeline-of-what-we-tried
“Incomplete Timeline” is a list of climate remediation steps “working
back from human extinction,” like “increased military fortification of
national, provincial, and state borders,” “the founding of several
utopias,” and “redefine the word wilderness.” These items begin with a
climax, or perhaps an anticlimax: “The coordinated release of various
strains of a human sterilization virus.” This is the jumping off point
for After World, which expands this final item to the action of a
wrenching tale whose backstory is the list’s remainder. Sen Anon – the
story’s semi-protagonist – is 18 years old when the world learns that
every person alive has been sterilized and so the human race is living
out its last years. The news triggers a manic insistence that this is a
good thing – long overdue, in fact – and the perfect opportunity to scan
every person alive for eventual reincarnation as virtual humans in an
Edenic cloud metaverse called Gaia. That way, people can continue to
live their lives without the haunting knowledge that everything they do
makes the planet worse for every other living thing, and each other.
Here, finally, is the resolution to the paradox of humanity: our desire
to do good, and our inevitable failure on that score. And so the Earth
is converted to a place of mass suicides, as people gurn and mug while
boarding airplanes filled with explosives so they can go out in a
literal blaze of glory. The food will run out soon, and the government
makes sure everyone has a suicide pill for the day when the hunger grows
too intense. Not everyone is lucky enough to get on one of the suicide
flights, and, being eager to see themselves off before they harm the
planet further, just hang themselves in the garage or jump off a roof.
They are counted as heroes, but also nuisances, because disposing of the
bodies is a lot of work. But some people – young people – are given a
mission to live on for as long as possible. These are the
observer/recorders who are charged to spend the last days of the species
closely watching the return of the natural world, the seeing off of
humanity, and to write it all down in longhand in a succession of
notebooks that are taken away by drones. This is part of the story
humanity cooks up for itself about extinction being a noble choice,
rather than a chaotic act born of desperation. Sen Anon is one of these
observers, and her mothers take her to a remote cabin to live out (and
observe) the last of humanity’s days, ensuring she is settled in and
then killing themselves. After all, without them, Sen Anon’s limited
food supply – meagerly supplemented by drones in proportion to the
quality of the observations in her notebooks – will stretch further.
Much of the novel takes the form of Sen Anon’s notebook observations,
countersunk with an omniscient third-person narrator who is revealed to
be [storyworker] ad39-393a-7fbc, a software agent involved in the
project to recreate all those dead humans in the Gaia metaverse.
[storyworker] ad39-393a-7fbc is a very unreliable narrator, who
reprograms itself through the course of the story, all the while
muttering asides to itself about the theoretical basis for telling Sen’s
story this way. [storyworker] ad39-393a-7fbc struggles with a
supervisory AI that has been charged with overseeing all the
[storyworkers], but which can’t – or won’t – rein in [storyworker]
ad39-393a-7fbc as [storyworker] ad39-393a-7fbc grows more involved in
Sen’s life. This experimental storytelling style (supplemented by found
texts from humanity’s dying, like a glossary of terms to be retired and
new terms being created by a linguist who is starving to death as they
complete their task) creates a contradictory narrative distance and
closeness. It’s a curiously flawed omniscience that’s allows Urbanski to
capture the yawning, bottomless horror of the climate emergency of today
and on the horizon. I don’t think I’ve ever experienced the kind of
sustained, deepening existential dread that After World created, chapter
by chapter. To sharpen this, Sen’s mothers – scientists who were given
exceptions to the no-child policy because their work was deemed
essential to the now-abandoned project of saving humanity – are grimly
supportive of the mass suicide project. When Sen’s own horror creeps up
on her, her mothers are sharp and often unkind, with only the smallest
flashes of love and sorrow for their daughter escaping their facades,
all the more vivid for their rarity. In contrast, [storyworker]
ad39-393a-7fbc grows ever more sympathetic to Sen and the rest of
vanished humanity. [storyworker] ad39-393a-7fbc is a very convincing
alien with motives and perspectives that are profoundly nonhuman, and
yet, the compassion and love are unmistakable. Of After World’s two
protagonists, [storyworker] ad39-393a-7fbc might be the more relatable.
It takes an alien point of view to truly see humanity’s flawed glory,

in 2026, when zero-emissions vehicles must represent 20% of all new car
sales, increasing to 60% in 2030 and 100% in 2035. In the U.S.,

The canal is one of the world’s busiest shipping routes, but a record
drought in the region has made for low water levels, forcing the canal
to cut daily crossings in recent months. Currently 22 ships are allowed
through per day, down from 36. Thanks to the November rain the number
will go up to 24, at least for now. The number was set to go down
sharply to 18 in February of next year.

More than 3 million Americans have relocated to avoid flood risk over

by data nonprofit First Street Foundation. The analysis underscores the
extent to which climate migration is already happening in America,
albeit on a hyper-local level. People are moving short distances within
their own cities, creating “Climate Abandonment Areas” – whole
neighborhoods that are seeing large population losses due to flooding
caused by climate change.
</p>
<p>
Over the next 30 years, more neighborhoods are expected to become
Climate Abandonment Areas, and their population losses will grow. “The
downstream implications of this are massive and impact property values,
neighborhood composition, and commercial viability both positively and
negatively,”

<strong></strong>About half of the world’s biggest companies have
managed to keep their air-travel emissions low in the years following
the pandemic slowdown, according to new

The advocacy group Transport and Environment looked at the emissions
from 217 major global companies and found for about 104 of them, air
travel emissions remain down by at least 50% compared to pre-COVID
levels. The group says this “shows the feasibility of a shift towards
less flying, more rail travel, and the increased use of virtual
meetings.” The largest emissions reductions came from technology giant
SAP (down 86%), pharmaceutical company Pfizer (down 78%), and consulting
group PwC (down 76%).

<p>date: 2023-12-18, from: Liam Proven blog</p>
<p>I am overdue. <br /><br />So, on Tuesday, as I said last week, I was
up at 4:30 to fly to Liverpool. I saw Ms Helene Stephenson, a senior
consultant there, who greeted me familiarly although I am ashamed to
admit I don’t remember meeting her before. <br />I got good news (for a
change).<br /><br />They are happy with how it’s uniting, and as soon as
1 year post-operation, they could maybe remove the plate in my wrist –
that is right under the skin, and causes me pain, which is why I’ve
taken to wearing a towelling wristband on that wrist. I don’t need to
bang it; just resting on a hard surface hurts.<br /><br />I can lift
heavier loads now, increasing slowly. (I was told to avoid any load over
1kg in July or so.) <br /><br />I can start swimming, and start
physiotherapy to try to build up some strength and increase the
rotation. I’ve made an appointment for January, and went for a swim on
Saturday and it was OK. It felt weird but it didn’t
hurt.<br /><br />Regarding my loss of supination (that’s the rotation in
the forearm: pronation is turning the palm of your hand downwards, for
example to type. I can do that. Supination is turning the palm upwards,
for instance to hold a bowl of soup. Soup -&gt; supination,
geddit?)<br /><br />Ms Stephenson thinks that maybe, with lots of
effort, I can regain as much rotation as I had before, although no more
than that. That would be a big deal. I haven’t been able to turn my palm
flat since the mid-1980s but not being able to hold my hand vertical,
like a blade or for a kung-fu chop downwards, is a major
handicap.<br /><br />It’s the first positive news in 9mth, and my
spirits are a little lifted.<br /><br />Then I went for a belated veggie
fry-up, followed by a pint, then a visit to Pete Young and family, which
was great. They’ve been looking after the laptop Douglas Spencer lent me
in hospital, and my noise-cancelling headphones as recommended by Tomáš
Brukner shortly before Ada arrived. I’ve really missed
those!<br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=lproven&ditemid=309122" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/>

<em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Two major shipping companies are
avoiding the Suez Canal as Houthi militants in Yemen step up their
assaults on commercial vessels in the Red Sea. Then, a veteran Hong Kong
pro-democracy campaigner goes on trial. And later: When the Taliban
captured Kabul, tens of thousands of Afghans were evacuated to the U.S.

<p>date: 2023-12-18, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog</p>
<p>It seems that former president Donald Trump is aligning his
supporters with a global far-right movement to destroy democracy. On
Saturday, in Durham, New Hampshire, Trump echoed Nazi leader Adolf
Hitler’s attacks on immigrants, saying they are “poisoning the blood of
our country”—although two of his three wives were immigrants—and quoted
Russian president Vladimir Putin’s attacks on American democracy. Trump
went on to praise North Korean autocratic leader Kim Jong Un and align
himself with Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán, the darling of the
American right wing, who has destroyed Hungary’s democracy and replaced
it with a dictatorship.</p>

<p>One interesting way to make our feed readers smarter about working
with Mastodon and Bluesky is to do the same kind of mapping from account
to feed we do with sites that support
<a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/12/17/rssAutodiscovery.html">feed
discovery</a>. When we see the user is trying to subscribe to a Mastodon
account, we know where its feed is, so subscribe to that. Same for
Bluesky. I expect we’ll do that for FeedLand via the

Plows Into Parked Vehicle in Biden’s Motorcade Outside Delaware Campaign
Office</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WILMINGTON, Del. — A car plowed into a parked SUV that was guarding
President Joe Biden ’s motorcade Sunday night while the president was
leaving a visit to his campaign headquarters. The president and first
lady Jill Biden were unharmed.</p>
<p>While Biden was walking from the campaign office to his waiting
armored SUV, a sedan hit a U.S. Secret Service vehicle that was being
used to close off intersections near the headquarters for the
president’s departure. The sedan then tried to continue into a
closed-off intersection, before Secret Service personnel surrounded the
vehicle with weapons drawn and instructed the driver to put his hands
up.</p>
<p>Biden was ushered into his waiting vehicle, where his wife was
already seated, before being driven swiftly back to their home. His
schedule was otherwise unaffected by the incident.</p>
<p>The Secret Service did not immediately comment on the incident.</p>

<h2 id="top-us-lawmaker-very-optimistic-on-ukraine-border-deal">Top US
Lawmaker ‘Very Optimistic’ on Ukraine, Border Deal</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — As U.S. congressional negotiators worked deep into the
weekend in a bid to craft an urgent deal linking aid to Ukraine and
Israel to new border security, one top Democrat said he was “very
optimistic” about a resolution.</p>
<p>“I’m very encouraged. I’m very optimistic they’re moving in a very
positive way,” Senator Joe Manchin, a centrist Democrat, told CNN’s
“State of the Union.”</p>
<p>He said he had been in touch with negotiators from both parties, as
well as the White House, and “they understand that the border is broken”
and needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>Three Senate negotiators — independent Kyrsten Sinema, Democrat Chris
Murphy and Republican James Lankford — met Saturday and were to meet
again Sunday in search of a compromise that would also include aid for
Taiwan.</p>
<p>All three cited progress after the Saturday talks, Politico
reported.</p>
<p>But at least one senior Republican senator, Lindsey Graham, sounded a
more cautious note Sunday, suggesting that some lawmakers were bridling
at the pressure for a quick deal.</p>
<p>“The bottom line here is we feel like we’re being jammed,” Graham
told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” We’re not anywhere close to a deal. It’ll
go into next year.”</p>
<p>The Biden administration has stressed the urgency of getting new aid,
particularly as Ukraine faces another winter under Russian attack.</p>
<p>Democrats support a proposed $61 billion package of military,
humanitarian and macroeconomic assistance.  </p>
<p>But Graham and other Republicans insist that Congress must first
shore up border security to stem a continuing influx of migrants.</p>
<p>He said a compromise was possible but warned Democrats that “I will
not help Ukraine, Taiwan or Israel until we secure a border that’s been
obliterated.”</p>
<p>Lawmakers had been due to go into recess Thursday evening.</p>
<p>But Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Thursday that the
chamber would return Monday, giving negotiators time to reach “a
framework agreement.”</p>
<p>Any deal reached in the Senate would also need to pass the
Republican-controlled House of Representatives, which has begun its
holiday recess. Its members can in theory be recalled to Washington to
vote if an agreement is reached.</p>

<p>The last episodes of

and how dramatic it is for absolutely no drama on screen. I’m surprised
the actors were willing to go along with it. The only good part was
where the Queen does standup near the end of the last episode. Something
like 80 hours of TV behind them, and all of a sudden this stoic
character, with no sense of humor whatsoever, who can’t even cry, is
bringing down the house. Oh please. I had to stick around to see how bad
it can get, now you don’t. If I had to give it a rating it would be

controllers and added an Italian translation. Version 1.3.11 fixed a bug
where FDISK was not writing the partition table of the 8th disk. You can
download the new versions from the FDISK repository

gave it a critic’s pick rating. It was good. But this isn’t a movie
review, it’s a review of the user interface for choosing movies on
streaming services. Why can’t we integrate a site like
<a href="http://metacritic.com/">Metacritic</a> with Hulu, Netflix,
Amazon, Max, AppleTV, et al. Just let me know what Metacritic says, and
make it clickable, so I can see what the individual pubs had to say if I
want more info. Don’t make me look it up. People joke about how we spend
our time scrolling around not watching anything. But it’s true, I do it.
Most of them are not worth the time, I suspect. But when you find one
that’s good, almost at random and even so had to do a lot of work to
determine if it was worth a chance, and this has been going on for a
decade, why doesn’t one of these services just buy Metacritic and
integrate it and make your users sing your praises everywhere online.
How much could Metacritic cost? (They seem to be in trouble, a lot of
the links generated by their CMS are broken.)</p>

do French artists, Wright Brothers &amp; AI have in common?</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-17, from: Om Malik blog</p>
<p>The 120th anniversary of the Wright brothers’ first flight serves as
a good reminder to reflect on the long arc of technology and its impact.
By drawing inspiration from Isaac Asimov and employing my “present
future” framework, I delve into the power of envisioning the future,
beginning with the futuristic visions of French artists at the turn of
the 20th century. Our collective history of progress and innovation as a
species provides a solid foundation for optimism about the future of
technology and AI.</p>

id="jungle-between-colombia-panama-becomes-highway-for-migrants-from-around-the-world">Jungle
Between Colombia, Panama Becomes Highway for Migrants From Around the
World</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MEXICO CITY — Once nearly impenetrable for migrants heading north
from Latin America, the jungle between Colombia and Panama this year
became a speedy but still treacherous highway for hundreds of thousands
of people from around the world.   </p>
<p>Driven by economic crises, government repression and violence,
migrants from China to Haiti decided to risk three days of deep mud,
rushing rivers and bandits. Enterprising locals offered guides and
porters, set up campsites and sold supplies to migrants, using
color-coded wristbands to track who had paid for what.   </p>
<p>Enabled by social media and Colombian organized crime, more than
506,000 migrants — nearly two-thirds Venezuelans — had crossed the
Darien jungle by mid-December, double the 248,000 who set a record the
previous year. Before last year, the record was barely 30,000 in
2016.   </p>
<p>Dana Graber Ladek, the Mexico chief for the United Nation’s
International Organization for Migration, said migration flows through
the region this year were “historic numbers that we have never
seen.”   </p>
<p>It wasn’t only in Latin America.   </p>
<p>The number of migrants crossing the Mediterranean or the Atlantic on
small boats to reach Europe this year has surged. More than 250,000
irregular arrivals were registered in 2023, according to the European
Commission.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A significant increase from recent years, the number remains well
below levels seen in the 2015 refugee crisis, when more than 1 million
people landed in Europe, most fleeing wars in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere.
Still, the rise has fed anti-migrant sentiment and laid the groundwork
for tougher legislation.   </p>
<p>Earlier this month, the British government announced tough new
immigration rules aimed at reducing the number of people able to move to
the U.K. each year by hundreds of thousands. Authorized immigration to
the U.K. set a record in 2022 with nearly 750,000.   </p>
<p>A week later, French opposition lawmakers rejected an immigration
bill from President Emmanuel Macron without even debating it. It had
been intended to make it easier for France to expel foreigners
considered undesirable. Far-right politicians alleged the bill would
have increased the number of migrants coming to the country, while
migrant advocates said it threatened the rights of
asylum-seekers.   </p>
<p>In Washington, the debate has shifted from efforts early in the year
to open new legal pathways largely toward measures to keep migrants out
as Republicans try to take advantage of the Biden administration’s push
for more aid to Ukraine to tighten the U.S. southern border.   </p>
<p>The U.S. started the year opening limited spaces to Venezuelans — as
well as Cubans, Nicaraguans and Haitians — in January to enter legally
for two years with a sponsor, while expelling those who didn’t qualify
to Mexico. Their numbers dropped somewhat for a time before climbing
again with renewed vigor.   </p>
<p>Venezuelan Alexander Mercado had only been back in his country for a
month after losing his job in Peru before he and his partner decided to
set off for the United States with their infant son.   </p>
<p>Venezuela’s minimum wage was the equivalent of about $4 a month then,
while 2.2 pounds (a kilogram) of beef was about $5, said Angelis Flores,
his 28-year-old wife.   </p>
<p>“Imagine how someone with a salary of $4 a month survives,” she
said.   </p>
<p>Mercado, 27, and Flores were already on their way when in September
the U.S. announced it was granting temporary legal status to more than
470,000 Venezuelans already in the country. Weeks later, the Biden
administration said it was resuming deportation flights to the South
American nation.   </p>
<p>Mercado and Flores hiked the well-trod trail through the jungle,
managing to push through in three days. Flores and their son, in
particular, got very sick. She believes they were infected by the
contaminated water they drank along the way.   </p>
<p>“There was a body in the middle of river and the ‘zamuros’, those
black birds, were eating it and picking it apart … all of that was
running in the river,” she said.   </p>
<p>For Mercado and Flores, the journey accelerated once they left the
jungle. In October, Panama and Costa Rica announced a deal to speed
migrants across their countries. Panama bused migrants to a center in
Costa Rica where they were held until they could buy a bus ticket to
Nicaragua.   </p>
<p>Nicaragua also seemed to opt for speeding migrants through its
territory. Mercado said they crossed on buses in a day.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>After discovering that Nicaragua had lax visa requirements, Cubans
and Haitians poured into Nicaragua on charter flights, purchasing
roundtrip tickets they never intended. Citizens of African nations made
circuitous series of connecting flights through Africa, Europe and Latin
America to arrive in Managua to start travelling overland toward the
United States, avoiding the Darien.   </p>
<p>In Honduras, Mercado and Flores were given a pass from authorities
allowing them five days to transit the country.   </p>
<p>Adam Isacson, an analyst tracking migration at the Washington Office
on Latin America, said that Panama, Costa Rica and Honduras grant
migrants legal status while they’re transiting the countries, which have
limited resources, and by letting migrants pass legally the countries
make them less vulnerable to extortion from authorities and
smugglers.  </p>
<p>Then there are Guatemala and Mexico, which Isacson called the
“we’re-going-to-make-a-show-of-blocking-you countries” attempting to
score points with the U.S. government.   </p>
<p>For many that has meant spending money to hire smugglers to cross
Guatemala and Mexico, or exposing themselves to repeated extortion
attempts.   </p>
<p>Mercado didn’t hire a smuggler and paid the price. It was “very
difficult to get through Guatemala,” he said. “The police kept taking
money.”   </p>
<p>But that was just a taste of what was to come.   </p>
<p>Standing outside a Mexico City shelter with their son on a recent
afternoon, Flores recounted all of the countries they had
traversed.   </p>
<p>“But they don’t rob you as much, extort you as much, send you back
like when you arrive here to Mexico,” she said. “Here the real nightmare
starts, because as soon as you enter they start taking a lot of your
money.”   </p>
<p>Mexico’s immigration system was thrown into chaos on March 27, when
migrants held in a detention center in the border city Juarez, across
from El Paso, Texas, set mattresses on fire inside their cell in
apparent protest. The highly flammable foam mattresses filled the cell
with thick smoke in an instant. Guards did not open the cell and 40
migrants died.   </p>
<p>The immigration agency’s director was among several officials charged
with crimes ranging from negligence to homicide. The agency closed 33 of
its smaller detention centers while it conducted a review.   </p>
<p>Unable to detain many migrants, Mexico instead circulated them around
the country, using brief, repeat detentions, each an opportunity for
extortion, said Gretchen Kuhner, director of IMUMI, a nongovernmental
legal services organization. Advocates called it the “politica de
desgaste” or wearing down policy.   </p>
<p>Mercado and Flores made it all the way to Matamoros, across the
border from Brownsville, Texas, where they were detained, held for a
night in an immigration facility in the border city of Reynosa and then
flown the next morning 650 miles (1046 kilometers) south to
Villahermosa.   </p>
<p>There they were released, but without their cell phones, shoelaces
and money. Mercado had to wait for his brother to send $100 so they
could start trying to make their way back to Mexico City through an
indirect route that required them to travel by truck, motorbike and even
horse.   </p>
<p>In late November, they had just made it back to Mexico City again.
This time Mercado was unequivocal: They would not leave Mexico City
until the U.S. government gave them an appointment to request asylum at
a border port of entry.   </p>
<p>“It is really hard to make it back here again,” he said. “If they
manage to send me back again I don’t know what I would do.”</p>

the US Keeps Funding Ukraine’s Military — Even as It Says It’s Out of
Money</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The White House has been increasingly pressuring
Congress to pass stalled legislation to support Ukraine’s war against
Russia, saying that funding has run out.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, however, President Joe Biden touted a new military aid
package worth $200 million for Ukraine.</p>
<p>Money is dwindling. But the announcement of more weapons being sent
to Kyiv just underscores the complexity of the funding. So has the money
run out? Or are there still a few billion dollars floating around?</p>
<p>It’s complicated.</p>
<p>Store credit …</p>
<p>In a Nov. 4 letter to Congress, White House budget director Shalanda
Young said flatly: “We are out of money to support Ukraine in this
fight. This isn’t a next year problem. The time to help a democratic
Ukraine fight against Russian aggression is right now.”</p>
<p>Since then, the U.S. has announced three more aid packages totaling
$475 million. That may seem contradictory, but it’s due to the complex
programs used to send aid to Ukraine.</p>
<p>There are two pots of money for weapons and security assistance set
up specifically for the war. One is the Presidential Drawdown Authority,
or PDA, under which the U.S. provides weapons already in its stockpile.
The other is the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which funds
long-term weapons contracts.</p>
<p>Money for USAI has all been spent. That pot is empty.</p>
<p>And money for the PDA also appeared to be gone. But then the Pentagon
determined that it had overstated the value of the weapons it had
already sent Ukraine, overcharging the Ukraine weapons account by $6.2
billion. That effectively left Ukraine with a store credit that is
slowly being whittled down. It now stands at around $4.4 billion.</p>
<p>PDA packages continued to be announced every few weeks. But in
recognition of the dwindling money, the latest packages have been
smaller — about $200 million or less, compared with previous ones that
often totaled $400 million to $500 million.</p>
<p>… but empty shelves</p>
<p>In theory, the Pentagon would have enough equipment to offer these
smaller packages for months. But there’s a caveat: While the credit
exists, there may not be enough stock on the Pentagon shelves. So some
weapons may be unavailable.</p>
<p>Congressional funding to buy weapons to replace the ones the U.S.
sends to Ukraine is now down to about $1 billion. That dwindling money
means the military services are worried they won’t be able to buy all
the weapons they need to ensure the U.S. military is ready to defend the
American homeland.</p>
<p>For example, the 155 mm rounds commonly used by Howitzers are one of
the most requested artillery munitions by Kyiv. The demand has been so
high that the Army has pressed the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in
Pennsylvania, where the shell casings for the rounds are made, to
increase production in order to meet war demands and have enough on hand
for American military needs.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, told
reporters the U.S. could provide the full $4.4 billion in weapons, but
with only a quarter of that amount available for replenishment, it’s a
tough choice. “We have to start to make decisions about our own
readiness,” he said.</p>
<p>Political wrangling</p>
<p>The U.S. has already sent Ukraine $111 billion in weapons, equipment,
humanitarian assistance and other aid since Russian President Vladimir
Putin launched his invasion more than 21 months ago. But the latest
package is stalled.</p>
<p>Support for Ukraine funding has been waning as some lawmakers see the
war taking funding from domestic needs. But the broader problem is a
political battle over the southern U.S. border.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden is urging Congress to pass a $110 billion aid
package for Ukraine, Israel and other national security needs. It
includes $61.4 billion for Ukraine, with about half to replenish
Pentagon stocks. It also includes about $14 billion for Israel as it
fights Hamas and $14 billion for U.S. border security. Other funds would
go for security needs in the Asia-Pacific.</p>
<p>Prospects for compromise remain in doubt, even as Zelenskyy warned in
a speech at the National Defense University in Washington on Monday
that, “If there’s anyone inspired by unresolved issues on Capitol Hill,
it’s just Putin and his sick clique.”</p>
<p>The jobs argument</p>
<p>Harkening back to the “all politics is local” idea, the Pentagon and
the White House have rolled out maps and statistics to show members of
Congress how their own districts and states are reaping benefits from
the Ukraine funding.</p>
<p>Charts detail $10 billion in industry contracts for weapons ranging
from air defense systems and missiles to a wide array of drones,
ammunition and other equipment. And they break out an additional nearly
$16.8 billion in contracts to replenish Pentagon stocks.</p>
<p>The maps show contracts benefitting industries and companies in more
than 35 different states. And U.S. officials are hoping the local jobs
argument will help build support for the funding.</p>
<p>How big is the need?</p>
<p>Winter has set in, so the fighting in Ukraine has leveled off a bit.
And along stretches of the battlefront, fighting is somewhat
stalemated.</p>
<p>But Ukrainian forces have been taking ground back in some key
locations, and Zelenskyy and other leaders have said they want to keep
pushing forward. Ukraine does not want to give the Russians weeks or
months this winter to reset and further solidify their fighting
positions — as they did last winter.</p>
<p>During his visit to Washington this week, Zelenskyy said his forces
are making progress, and the White House pointed to newly declassified
intelligence that shows Ukraine has inflicted heavy losses on Russia in
recent fighting around the eastern city of Avdiivka — including 13,000
casualties and over 220 combat vehicles lost. The Ukrainian holdout in
the country’s partly occupied east has been the center of some of the
fiercest fighting in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Putin on Thursday, however, said his troops are making gains.</p>
<p>“Almost all along the line of contact our armed forces, let’s put it
modestly, are improving their positions, almost all are in an active
stage of action and there is an improvement in the position of our
troops all along,” he said.</p>

<h2 id="us-woman-criminally-charged-after-miscarriage">US Woman
Criminally Charged After Miscarriage</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio — Ohio was in the throes of a bitter debate over
abortion rights this fall when Brittany Watts, 21 weeks and 5 days
pregnant, began passing thick blood clots.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old Watts, who had not shared the news of her pregnancy
even with her family, made her first prenatal visit to a doctor’s office
behind Mercy Health-St. Joseph’s Hospital in Warren, a working-class
city about 100 kilometers southeast of Cleveland.</p>
<p>The doctor said that, while a fetal heartbeat was still present,
Watts’ water had broken prematurely and the fetus she was carrying would
not survive. He advised heading to the hospital to have her labor
induced, so she could have what amounted to an abortion to deliver the
nonviable fetus. Otherwise, she would face “significant risk” of death,
records of her case show.</p>
<p>That was a Tuesday in September. What followed was a harrowing three
days entailing: multiple trips to the hospital; Watts miscarrying into,
and then flushing and plunging, a toilet at her home; a police
investigation of those actions; and Watts, who is Black, being charged
with abuse of a corpse. That’s a fifth-degree felony punishable by up to
a year in prison and a $2,500 fine.</p>
<p>Her case was sent last month to a grand jury. It has touched off a
national firestorm over the treatment of pregnant women, and especially
Black women, in the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs v.
Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision that overturned Roe v.
Wade.</p>
<p>Civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump elevated Watts’ plight in a post
to X, formerly Twitter.</p>
<p>Michele Goodwin, a law professor at the University of California,
Irvine, and author of Policing The Womb, said the case follows a pattern
of women’s pregnancies being criminalized against them. She said those
efforts have long overwhelmingly targeted Black and brown women.</p>
<p>Even before Roe was overturned, studies show that Black women who
visited hospitals for prenatal care were 10 times more likely than white
women to have child protective services and law enforcement called on
them, even when their cases were similar, she said.</p>
<p>“Post-Dobbs, what we see is kind of a wild, wild West,” said Goodwin.
“You see this kind of muscle-flexing by district attorneys and
prosecutors wanting to show that they are going to be vigilant, they’re
going to take down women who violate the ethos coming out of the state’s
Legislature.”</p>
<p>She called Black women “canaries in the coal mine” for the
“hyper-vigilant type of policing” women of all races might expect from
the nation’s network of health care providers, law enforcers and courts
now that abortion isn’t federally protected.</p>
<p>At the time of Watts’ miscarriage, abortion was legal in Ohio through
21 weeks, six days of pregnancy. Her lawyer, Traci Timko, said Watts sat
for eight hours at Mercy Health-St. Joseph’s awaiting care on the eve of
her pregnancy reaching 22 weeks, before leaving without being
treated.</p>
<p>Timko said hospital officials had been deliberating over the
legalities.</p>
<p>“It was the fear of, is this going to constitute an abortion and are
we able to do that,” Timko said. The hospital didn’t return calls
seeking confirmation and comment.</p>
<p>But B. Jessie Hill, a law professor at Case Western Reserve
University School of Law, said the hospital was in a bind.</p>
<p>“These are the razor’s edge decisions that health care providers are
being forced to make,” she said. “And all the incentives are pushing
hospitals to be conservative, because on the other side of this is
criminal liability.”</p>
<p>Warren Assistant Prosecutor Lewis Guarnieri told Warren Municipal
Court Judge Terry Ivanchak during Watts’ preliminary hearing that she
left home for a hair appointment after miscarrying, leaving the toilet
clogged. Police would later find the fetus wedged in the pipes.</p>
<p>“The issue isn’t how the child died, when the child died,” Guarnieri
told the judge, according to TV station WKBN. “It’s the fact the baby
was put into a toilet, was large enough to clog up the toilet, left in
that toilet, and she went on (with) her day.”</p>
<p>In court, Timko bristled.</p>
<p>“This 33-year-old girl with no criminal record is demonized for
something that goes on every day,” she said.</p>
<p>The size and stage of development of Watts’ fetus became an issue
during her preliminary hearing.</p>
<p>At the time, vigorous campaigning over Issue 1, an ultimately
successful amendment to enshrine a right to abortion in Ohio’s
constitution, included ads alleging the amendment would allow abortions
“until birth.”</p>
<p>A county forensic investigator reported feeling “what appeared to be
a small foot with toes” inside Watts’ toilet. Police seized the toilet
and broke it apart to retrieve the intact fetus as evidence. An autopsy
confirmed that the fetus died in utero before passing through the birth
canal and identified “no recent injuries.”</p>
<p>The judge acknowledged the case’s complexities when he bound the case
over to the grand jury.</p>
<p>“There are better scholars than I am to determine the exact legal
status of this fetus, corpse, body, birthing tissue, whatever it is,” he
said from the bench.</p>
<p>Assistant Trumbull County Prosecutor Diane Barber, lead prosecutor on
Watts’ case, could not speak specifically about the case, other than to
note the county is compelled to move forward with it. She doesn’t expect
a grand jury finding this month.</p>
<p>Timko, a former prosecutor, said Ohio’s abuse-of-corpse statute is
vague.</p>
<p>“From a legal perspective, there’s no definition of ‘corpse,’” she
said. “Can you be a corpse if you never took a breath?”</p>
<p>Grace Howard, assistant justice studies professor at San José State
University, said clarity on what about Watts’ behavior constituted a
crime is essential.</p>
<p>“Her miscarriage was entirely ordinary,” she said. “So I just want to
know what (the prosecutor) thinks she should have done. If we are going
to require people to collect and bring used menstrual products to
hospitals so that they can make sure it is indeed a miscarriage, it’s as
ridiculous and invasive as it is cruel.”</p>

<h2 id="face-masks-now-an-occasional-feature-of-us-landscape">Face Masks
Now an Occasional Feature of US Landscape</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — The scene: A crowded shopping center in the weeks before
Christmas. Or a warehouse store. Or maybe a packed airport terminal or a
commuter train station or another place where large groups gather.</p>
<p>There are people — lots of people. But look around, and it’s clear
one thing is largely absent these days: face masks.</p>
<p>Yes, there’s the odd one here and there, but nothing like it was
three years ago at the dawn of the COVID pandemic’s first winter
holidays — an American moment of contentiousness, accusation and scorn
on both sides of the mask debate.</p>
<p>As 2023 draws to an end, with promises of holiday parties and crowds
and lots of inadvertent exchanges of shared air, mask-wearing is much
more off than on around the country even as COVID’s long tail lingers.
The days of anything approaching a widespread mask mandate would be like
the Ghost of Christmas Past, a glimpse into what was.</p>
<p>Look at it a different way, though: These days, mask-wearing has
become just another thing that simply happens in America. In a country
where the mention of a mask prior to the pandemic usually meant
Halloween or a costume party, it’s a new way of being that hasn’t gone
away even if most people aren’t doing it regularly.</p>
<p>“That’s an interesting part of the pandemic,” says Brooke Tully, a
strategist who works on how to change people’s behaviors.</p>
<p>“Home delivery of food and all of those kind of services, they
existed before COVID and actually were gaining some momentum,” she says.
“But something like mask-wearing in the U.S. didn’t really have an
existing baseline. It was something entirely new in COVID. So it’s one
of those new introductions of behaviors and norms.”</p>
<p>The situation now is … situational</p>
<p>It tends to be situational, like the recent decision from the
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center hospital system to reinstate a
mask mandate at its facilities starting Dec. 20 because it’s seeing an
increase in respiratory viruses. And for people like Sally Kiser, 60, of
Mooresville, North Carolina, who manages a home health care agency.</p>
<p>“I always carry one with me,” she says, “’cause I never know.”</p>
<p>She doesn’t always wear it, depending on the environment she’s in,
but she will if she thinks it’s prudent. “It’s kind of like a new
paradigm for the world we live in,” she says.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that long ago that fear over catching COVID-19 sent demand
for masks into overdrive, with terms like “N95” coming into our
vocabularies alongside concepts like mask mandates — and the subsequent,
and vehement, backlash from those who felt it was government
overreach.</p>
<p>Once the mandates started dropping, the masks started coming off and
the demand fell. It fell so much so that Project N95, a nonprofit
launched during the pandemic to help people find quality masks,
announced earlier this month that it would stop sales Monday because
there wasn’t enough interest.</p>
<p>Anne Miller, the organization’s executive director, acknowledges she
thought widespread mask usage would become the rule, not the
exception.</p>
<p>“I thought the new normal would be like we see in other cultures and
other parts of the world — where people just wear a mask out of an
abundance of caution for other people,” she says.</p>
<p>But that’s not how norms work, public safety or otherwise, says
Markus Kemmelmeier, a professor of sociology at the University of
Nevada, Reno.</p>
<p>In 2020, Kemmelmeier authored a study about mask-wearing around the
country that showed mask usage and mandate resistance varied by region
based on conditions including pre-existing cultural divisions and
political orientation.</p>
<p>He points to the outcry after the introduction of seat belts and seat
belt laws more than four decades ago as an example of how practices,
particularly those required in certain parts of society, do or don’t
take hold.</p>
<p>“When they first were instituted with all the sense that they make
and all the effectiveness, there was a lot of resistance,” Kemmelmeier
says. “The argument was basically lots of complaints about individual
freedoms being curtailed and so forth, and you can’t tell me what to do
and so forth.”</p>
<p>Figuring out the balance</p>
<p>In New York City’s Brooklyn borough, members of the Park Slope Co-op
recently decided there was a need at the longstanding,
membership-required grocery. Last month, the co-op instituted
mask-required Wednesdays and Thursdays; the other five days continue to
have no requirement.</p>
<p>The people who proposed it weren’t focused on COVID rates. They were
thinking about immune-compromised people, a population that has always
existed but came to mainstream awareness during the pandemic, says co-op
general manager Joe Holtz.</p>
<p>Proponents of the mask push at the co-op emphasized that
immunocompromised people are more at risk from other people’s
respiratory ailments like colds and flu. Implementing a window of
required mask usage allows them to be more protected, Holtz says.</p>
<p>It was up to the store’s administrators to pick the days, and they
went with two of the slowest instead of the busy weekend days on
purpose, Holtz says, a nod to the reality that mask requirements get
different responses from people.</p>
<p>“From management’s point of view,” he says, “if we were going to try
and if there’s going to be a negative financial impact from this
decision that was made, we want to minimize it.”</p>
<p>Those shopping there on a recent Thursday didn’t seem fazed.</p>
<p>Aron Halberstam, 77, says he doesn’t usually mask much these days but
wasn’t put off by the requirement. He wears a mask on the days it’s
required, even if he doesn’t otherwise — a middle ground reflecting what
is happening in so many parts of the country more than three years after
the mask became a part of daily conversation and daily life.</p>
<p>“Any place which asks you to do it, I just do it,” Halberstam says.
“I have no resistance to it.”</p>
<p>Whatever the level of resistance, says Kemmelmeier, the culture has
shifted. People are still wearing masks in places like crowded stores or
while traveling. They do so because they choose to for their own reasons
and not because the government is requiring it. And new reasons can come
up as well, like when wildfires over the summer made air quality poor
and people used masks to deal with the haze and smoke.</p>
<p>“It always will find a niche to fit in with,” he says. “And as long
as there are needs somewhere, it will survive.”</p>

<p>date: 2023-12-17, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog</p>
<p>Today is the 250th anniversary of the Boston Tea Party, when 30 or
more men boarded three trading vessels in Boston Harbor. They broke open
342 chests of tea and dumped about 90,000 pounds of the valuable leaves
overboard. The pointed destruction of a cargo worth about $1.7 million
in today’s dollars escalated the ongoing struggle between the British
government and thirteen of its North American colonies.</p>

look OK but the device does not charge. When on AC power then it shows

<p>During 2018 and 2019 I used the PSION Organiser IILZ as my alarm
clock. It was very good for that: it is possible to define eight or so
different alarms which can be repeated daily, on workdays, on weekends
or just in selected day of week. It fitted my needs very well. And she
sound was loud enough (unlike the alarm on m68k Palms which is useless
because it is quiet and very short). It has been also practical to have
a simple note taking device near my bed - to record some evening ideas
and so.</p>

id="confederate-memorial-to-be-removed-from-arlington-national-cemetery">Confederate
Memorial to be Removed From Arlington National Cemetery</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>arlington, virginia — A Confederate memorial is to be removed from
Arlington National Cemetery in the U.S. state of Virginia in the coming
days, part of the push to remove symbols that commemorate the
Confederacy from military-related facilities, a cemetery official said
Saturday. </p>
<p>The decision ignores a recent demand from more than 40 Republican
congressmen that the Pentagon suspend efforts to dismantle and remove
the monument from Arlington cemetery. </p>
<p>Safety fencing has been installed around the memorial, and officials
anticipate completing the removal by December 22, the Arlington National
Cemetery said in an email. During the removal, the surrounding
landscape, graves and headstones will be protected, the Arlington
National Cemetery said. </p>
<p>Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin disagrees with the decision and
plans to move the monument to the New Market Battlefield State
Historical Park in the Shenandoah Valley, Youngkin spokeswoman Macaulay
Porter said. </p>
<p>In 2022, an independent commission recommended that the memorial be
taken down, as part of its final report to Congress on renaming of
military bases and assets that commemorate the Confederacy. </p>
<p>The statue, unveiled in 1914, features a bronze woman, crowned with
olive leaves, standing on a 32-foot pedestal, and was designed to
represent the American South. According to Arlington, the woman holds a
laurel wreath, a plow stock and a pruning hook, with a Biblical
inscription at her feet that says: “They have beat their swords into
plough-shares and their spears into pruning hooks.” </p>
<p>Some of the figures also on the statue include a Black woman depicted
as “Mammy” holding what is said to be the child of a white officer, and
an enslaved man following his owner to war. </p>
<p>In a recent letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, more than 40
House Republicans said the commission overstepped its authority when it
recommended that the monument be removed. The congressmen contended that
the monument “does not honor nor commemorate the Confederacy; the
memorial commemorates reconciliation and national unity.” </p>
<p>“The Department of Defense must respect Congress’ clear legislative
intentions regarding the Naming Commission’s legislative authority” the
letter said. </p>
<p>U.S. Representative Andrew Clyde, a Georgia Republican, has led the
push to block the memorial’s removal. Clyde’s office did not immediately
respond to an email seeking comment Saturday. </p>
<p>A process to prepare for the memorial’s removal and relocation has
been completed, the cemetery said. The memorial’s bronze elements will
be relocated, while the granite base and foundation will remain in place
to avoid disturbing surrounding graves, it said. </p>
<p>Earlier this year, Fort Bragg shed its Confederate namesake to become
Fort Liberty, part of the broad Department of Defense initiative,
motivated by the 2020 George Floyd protests, to rename military
installations that had been named after confederate soldiers. </p>
<p>The North Carolina base was originally named in 1918 for General
Braxton Bragg, a Confederate general from Warrenton, North Carolina, who
was known for owning slaves and losing key Civil War battles that
contributed to the Confederacy’s downfall. </p>
<p>The Black Lives Matter demonstrations that erupted nationwide after
Floyd’s killing by a white police officer, coupled with ongoing efforts
to remove Confederate monuments, turned the spotlight on the Army
installations. The naming commission created by Congress visited the
bases and met with members of the surrounding communities for input.</p>
