id="street-medicine-teams-search-for-homeless-people-to-deliver-lifesaving-iv-hydration-in-extreme-heat">Street
medicine teams search for homeless people to deliver lifesaving IV
hydration in extreme heat</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Phoenix — Alfred Handley leaned back in his wheelchair alongside a
major Phoenix freeway as a street medicine team helped him get
rehydrated with an intravenous saline solution dripping from a bag
hanging on a pole.</p>
<p>Cars whooshed by under the blazing 96-degree morning sun as the
59-year-old homeless man with a nearly toothless smile got the help he
needed through a new program run by the nonprofit Circle the City.  </p>
<p>“It’s a lot better than going to the hospital,” Handley said of the
team that provides health care to homeless people. He’s been treated
poorly at traditional clinics and hospitals, he said, more than six
years after being struck by a car while he sat on a wall, leaving him in
a wheelchair.</p>
<p>Circle the City introduced its IV rehydration program as a way to
protect homeless people from life-threatening heat illness as
temperatures regularly hit the triple-digits in America’s hottest metro.
Homeless people accounted for nearly half of the record 645 heat-related
deaths last year in Maricopa County, which encompasses metro
Phoenix.</p>
<p>Dr. Liz Frye, vice chair of the Street Medicine Institute that
provides training to hundreds of health care teams worldwide, said she
didn’t know of groups other than Circle the City administering IVs on
the street.</p>
<p>“But if that’s what needs to happen to keep somebody from dying, I’m
all about it,” Frye said.</p>
<p>As summers grow warmer, health providers from San Diego to New York
are being challenged to better protect homeless patients.</p>
<p>Even the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program, featured in
last year’s book, “Rough Sleepers,” now sees patients with mild heat
exhaustion in the summer after decades of treating people with frostbite
and hypothermia during the winter, said Dr. Dave Munson, the street
team’s medical director.</p>
<p>“It’s certainly something to worry about,” said Munson, noting that
temperatures in Boston hit 100 degrees with 70% humidity during June’s
heat wave. Homeless people, he said, are vulnerable to very hot and very
cold weather not only because they live outside, but they often can’t
regulate body temperature due to medication for mental illness or high
blood pressure, or because of street substance use.</p>
<p>The Phoenix team searches for patients in homeless encampments in dry
riverbeds, sweltering alleys and along the canals that bring water to
the Phoenix area. About 15% are dehydrated enough for a saline drip.
 </p>
<p>“We go out every day and find them,” said nurse practitioner Perla
Puebla. “We do their wound care, medication refills for diabetes,
antibiotics, high blood pressure.”</p>
<p>Puebla’s street team ran across Handley and 36-year-old Phoenix
native Phillip Enriquez near an overpass in an area frequented by
homeless people because it’s near a facility offering free meals. Across
the road was an encampment of tents and lean-tos along a chain-link
fence.  </p>
<p>Enriquez sat on a patch of dirt as Puebla started a drip for him. She
also gave him a prescription for antibiotics and a referral to a dentist
for his dental infection.</p>
<p>Living outside in Arizona’s broiling sun is hard, especially for
people who may be mentally ill or use sedating drugs like fentanyl that
make them less aware of surroundings. Stimulants like methamphetamine
contribute to dehydration, which can be fatal.</p>
<p>Temperatures this year have reached 115 degrees (45 Celsius) in metro
Phoenix, where six heat-related deaths have been confirmed through June
22. Another 111 are under investigation.</p>
<p>“The number of patients with heat illnesses is increasing every
year,” said Dr. Aneesh Narang, assistant medical director of emergency
medicine at Banner Medical Center-Phoenix, which treats many homeless
people with heat stroke.</p>
<p>Narang’s staff works frequently with Circle the City, whose core
mission is providing respite care, with 100 beds for homeless people not
well enough to return to the streets after a hospital stay.</p>
<p>Extreme heat worldwide requires a dramatic response, said physician
assistant Lindsay Fox, who cares for homeless people in Albuquerque, New
Mexico, through an initiative run by the University of New Mexico’s
School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Three times weekly, Fox treats infections, cleans wounds and manages
chronic conditions in consultation with hospital colleagues. She said
the prospect of more heat illness worries her.</p>
<p>Highs in Albuquerque can hit the 90s and don’t fall enough for people
living outside to cool off overnight, she said.</p>
<p>“If you’re in an urban area that’s primarily concrete, you’re
retaining heat,” she said. “We’re seeing heat exposure that very quickly
could go to heat stroke.”</p>
<p>Serious heat stroke is far more common in metro Phoenix, where Circle
the City is now among scores of health programs for the homeless in
cities like New York, San Diego and Spokane, Washington.</p>
<p>Circle the City, founded in 2012 by Sister Adele O’Sullivan, a
physician and member of the Sisters of St. Joseph Carondelet, now has
260 employees, including 15 doctors, 13 physician assistants and 11
nurse practitioners. It annually sees 9,000 patients.</p>
<p>Grants, donations and other gifts account for about 20% of the
funding. Most of the rest comes from insurance payments for services
provided through Medicaid and Medicare.</p>
<p>Circle the City works with medical staff in seven Phoenix hospitals
to help homeless patients get after-care when they no longer need
hospitalization. It also staffs two outpatient clinics for follow-up.
 </p>
<p>“This partnership allows us to offer the best outcomes for our
patients,” said Craig Orsini, social work manager at St. Joseph’s
Hospital and Medical Center in Phoenix.</p>
<p>Often that’s a few weeks in respite care or, for less acute needs, a
stay in one of a handful of medical beds at the downtown shelter for
things like dressing changes for wounds. Someone who needs months to
heal might go to a skilled nursing facility.</p>
<p>While patients recover, Circle the City works to find longer-term
transitional shelter such as those for people 55 and older, or in
permanent housing. About 77% of respite patients are sent somewhere
other than the street or an emergency shelter.</p>
<p>“We try to find the best fit for people,” said Wendy Adams, Circle
the City’s community outreach supervisor.</p>
<p>Circle the City medical staff distributes tens of thousands of water
bottles each summer and tries to educate people about hot weather
dangers, said Dr. Matt Essary, who works at one of five mobile clinics
that stop outside soup kitchens and other services for homeless
people. </p>
<p>Essary said Circle the City is also considering a blood analysis tool
to detect electrolyte imbalances caused by dehydration.</p>
<p>“You can see right away how dehydrated they have become because it’s
so hard to draw their blood,” he said. Other possible symptoms include
headache, extreme thirst, dizziness and dry mouth.</p>
<p>“We also see a lot of people with surface burns,” Essary said of the
wounds common in broiling Phoenix, where a medical emergency or
intoxication can cause someone to fall on a sizzling sidewalk.</p>
<p>Rachel Belgrade waited outside Circle the City’s retrofitted truck
with her black-and-white puppy, Bo, for Essary to write a prescription
for the blood pressure medicine she lost when a man stole her bicycle.
She accepted two bottles of water to cool off as the morning heat
rose. </p>
<p>“They make all of this easier,” said Belgrade, a Native American from
the Gila River tribe. “They don’t give you a hard time.”</p>

id="california-lawmakers-unveil-10-billion-bond-proposals-for-climate-and-schools">California
lawmakers unveil $10 billion bond proposals for climate and schools</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SACRAMENTO, Calif. — California lawmakers on Sunday announced they
plan to put two bond measures on the ballot in November, one that would
ask voter approval to borrow $10 billion for climate programs and
another that would borrow $10 billion to build or repair public schools.
If passed by the Legislature later this week, the bonds would appear on
the Nov. 5 ballot. Lawmakers announced the bond proposals on Sunday, one
day after Gov. Gavin Newsom signed California’s budget. The spending
plan closes an estimated $46.8 billion deficit in part through $16
billion in spending cuts.</p>
<p>“These bond measures are critical to the future of this state, and
invest in our kids, their neighborhood schools, and they ensure
communities big and small have access to clean drinking water and are
wildfire safe,” Democratic state Senate President Pro Tempore Mike
McGuire said in a statement.</p>
<p>The climate initiative would help communities recover from wildfires,
floods, drought and other natural catastrophes.</p>
<p>The clean water and wildfire bond would cover $10 billion in
strategic investments for safe drinking water, as well as funding for
“wildfire and forest resilience, sea-level rise, extreme heat
mitigation, clean air, and protecting biodiversity,” according to a
statement from McGuire’s office.</p>
<p>Officials said it would be the single largest investment in public
funding for climate resilience in California’s history.</p>
<p>The second measure would provide $10 billion in borrowed money to
modernize and repair schools. K-12 schools would get $8.5 billion, while
California community colleges would receive $1.5 billion. The debt would
be designated for new construction, improving existing campuses, career
technical education and energy efficiency grants. </p>
<p>“Districts will be able to ensure schools have essential facilities
like kitchens and libraries, equip students with the skills for
high-demand technical careers, and provide greater access to broadband
internet,” said Sen. Josh Newman, a Democrat who chairs the Senate
Education Committee. “This bond ensures that our schools are safe,
modern, and well-prepared for the 21st-century.”</p>
<p>Lawmakers passed the state budget last Wednesday after Newsom and
legislative leaders both made concessions. They were forced for the
second year in a row to pare back or delay some progressive policies
that were previously paid for with the help of record-breaking surpluses
during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The bond measures, if approved by voters, would allow legislators to
borrow money not allocated by the budget. In March, voters narrowly —
50.18% to 49.82% — approved a plan to borrow $6.38 billion to build
4,350 housing units for homeless residents and add 6,800 mental health
and addiction treatment beds.</p>

category 3 storm. Barbados, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadine
Islands, Grenada, and Tobago – islands that don’t normally endure storms
of this magnitude – are all under hurricane warnings and bracing for
catastrophic damage. The storm is forecast to push toward Jamaica before
weakening slightly mid-week and then heading toward Mexico. The system
strengthened from a tropical depression to a hurricane in less than 48
hours, which is unusually fast. It was at one point registering as a
category 4 storm (and could do so again), the earliest ever recorded in
the Atlantic, marking an ominous start to what is expected to be a very
intense hurricane season. “Incredible doesn’t cut it,”

big in France’s elections</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-01, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
<em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Marine Le Pen’s far-right National
Rally party has pulled off a victory in the first round of elections in
France and could turn French politics on its head. Then, with only three
days to go before the United Kingdom’s general election, one of the big
issues is housing costs. But are any of the political parties’ pledges
giving people hope that they can solve Britain’s housing crunch?

<h2 id="electric-cars-heat-problem">Electric Cars’ Heat Problem</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-01, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjUwOTYyOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NTc0MjgxNn0.Y_mBIcV8Z6FwaZGRwxm60gsm1h35JsGJ_ydeyd5nsZQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
If the world is going to slash greenhouse emissions from transportation,
then we need a vast number of drivers to switch from fossil fuel engines
to electric cars powered by renewable energy. Yet the EVs we need to
mitigate further climate damage might, in one way, be ill-suited to the
warmer and more extreme climate we’ve already created.
</p>
<p>
You may have heard that frigid temps are no friend of the electric
vehicle. That is true, since
<a href="https://www.recurrentauto.com/research/winter-ev-range-loss" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>extreme
cold</u></a> is a two-pronged problem. First, physical processes in the
battery happen more slowly if it’s chilly out. When the mercury drops,
my Tesla Model 3 displays a little snowflake icon to warn me the battery
unit is too cold to actually use all the range that should be in there.
The second problem is maintaining a comfortable cabin. The battery
expends a lot of energy generating enough heat to keep the interior warm
for its occupants when the temperatures fall to freezing or below.
</p>
<p>
When it comes to hot days, that second problem is the big one. The
agency Recurrent completed a
<a href="https://www.recurrentauto.com/research/what-a-c-does-to-your-range" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>study</u></a>
this month that demonstrated just how much range is lost on sweltering
days like those of this month’s nationwide heat wave.
</p>
<p>
As long as the afternoon high temperature doesn’t get
<em><em>too</em></em> high, an EV’s range loss is manageable. With an
outside temp of 80 degrees Fahrenheit, they found the car loses only
2.8% of its range to keep the cabin at 70 degrees. Even at 90 degrees,
the loss reaches just 5%. That amounts to just 10 miles lost from a
200-mile EV. You might not even notice it — it’s probably not that far
off from what’s lost by driving 80 miles per hour down the freeway
instead of the posted speed limit of 65.
</p>
<p>
When it’s dangerously hot out, though, the story changes quickly. At 95
degrees outside, the average EV loses 15% of its potential range. At 100
degrees outside, the car suffers a staggering 31% range loss to maintain
70 degrees inside the car. The bigger the difference between the outside
temperature and the desired inside temperature, the more of your juice
is lost to climate control rather than moving the vehicle. This is why
range loss is typically worse in winter — a 10-degree day in Duluth
means you’re 60 degrees away from the desired 70 Fahrenheit, while a
110-degree day in Phoenix is “only” 40 degrees from the target.
</p>
<p>
I’ve seen this phenomenon first-hand during scorching trips across the
desert from Los Angeles to Las Vegas or up the interstate toward the San
Francisco Bay Area, where the drive passed through areas that exceeded
110 degrees. The car offers an estimate for how much will be left on the
battery upon arrival at the next charging stop — then that estimate
slowly dips lower and lower as more energy is expended just on air
conditioning. After a few anxious drives, I learned to hoard a bit more
charge than the car thinks it needs to make it comfortably to the next
station.
</p>
<p>
There is also the possibility that lots of
<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/electric-vehicles-arent-ready-for-extreme-heat-and-cold-heres-how-to-fix-them/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>high-temperature
driving</u></a> will cause long-term damage to the battery’s electrolyte
or other components. There isn’t too much to do about this one other
than limiting how often you drive on extreme days, if you can, and hope
that future battery materials that are more resistant to heat become a
reality sooner rather than later.
</p>
<p>
However, there are ways to mitigate the EV heat problem during your
drive time. It takes more energy to air-condition the cabin down to the
proper temperature than it does to maintain the temperature. So, if
you’re plugged in to charge at home or at a public charger, have your
vehicle reach the desired temp before you unplug and leave.
</p>
<p>
Also, the figures in Recurrent’s study are based on setting the climate
control to 70 degrees. If you and your passengers can cope with a higher
cabin temperature, say 75 degrees, then you’re shortening the difference
by 5 degrees and giving your battery a break. (Plenty of EV adopters
have gone through a moment of panic where they thought they might need
to turn off the climate control entirely to ensure they reached their
next plug-in.)
</p>
<p>
Should the planet’s new normal of extreme heat deter you from going
electric? First, remember the manta that experts repeat as a rebuttal to
range anxiety: Most people do the vast majority of their driving close
to home. Running the A/C on max to survive an August trip to Trader
Joe’s isn’t going to make your EV battery hit zero unless you were too
low to begin with.
</p>
<p>
If you’re really worried about the extreme temperatures of your home
region, then splurge for range. I’ve recommended this before regardless
of where you live and drive. But if you live in the middle of the desert
and can afford the longer-range version of a particular EV, then buy it
and save yourself the mental strain of wondering whether the summer sun
will limit how far you can really drive your car.

<h2 id="on-being-humble-and-accepting-success">On being humble and
accepting success</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-01, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;There’s a subtle difference between being humble and pretending to be something you’re not. If you are successful in some field you can—and should—recognise your success while still being humble and not letting the success make you arrogant. I find that not doing that, not recognising your success in any shape or form, can grind me in the wrong way. Because at some point you start to feel disingenuous. &lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
People and Blog is a passion project. It’s not a “successful” project by
any metric. Combining RSS, Email and the site, it probably has a few
thousand readers. And don’t get me wrong, it’s great. I’m grateful for
that and I’ll continue to post these interviews for as long as I can. 71
incredibly <a href="http://manuelmoreale.com/supporters">kind people</a>
have also decided to contribute some of their money to support it and
that’s also something I’m very appreciative of.
</p>
<p>
Still, I think of P&amp;B as a very niche side project, far from being a
successful one. Now let’s imagine that instead of a few thousand, the
P&amp;B audience was a few hundreds of thousands and instead of 71
people, 7000 were contributing something every month. At the current
average that would net me almost 16000$ a month. That’s around 200k a
year and it would make me in the top 0.5% of earners here in Italy.
Could I still go around claiming my project was not successful? Hell no.
I’d be a hypocrite if I were to do that. And you’d be rightfully pissed
at me if I were still nudging you to support for 1$ a month while also
being part of the 1%.
</p>
<p>
I find it interesting that the pursuit of endless growth is something we
despise when corporations are doing it but it’s not something that
bothers us too much when it’s done by “content creators”. And yet, after
a certain scale, it’s the same mindset. This is why I love to support
small creators who do things simply because they enjoy it and are not
driven by other incentives.
</p>
<p>
I love something <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-om-malik">Om said
in his interview </a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I love supporting the small media, but don’t have time for establishment
media outlets. I don’t much care for some of the larger blogs as well.
And same goes for the larger YouTubers and podcasts. You need to catch
them early — that’s when they really are pure and hustling to serve the
reader.

<h2 id="psycopg-3.2-released">Psycopg 3.2 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-01, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
After 846 commits and close to two years in the making, we are very
happy to announce the release of
<a href="https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/">Psycopg 3.2</a>!
</p>
<p>
This release adds several new features to the Psycopg 3 line, some of
which are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
support for Numpy scalar types
</li>
<li>
easier to use notifications reception
</li>
<li>
the possibility to run queries with PostgreSQL-format parameters
</li>
<li>
a row factory to return a scalar from a query
</li>
<li>
asynchronous, encrypted cancellations
</li>
<li>
support for the many new features added in the upcoming PostgreSQL v17
</li>
<li>
OpenSSL 3.x bundled with binary packages
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A few bug bug fixes are included too, which have also been independently
released in the 3.1.20 package. Given the high level of compatibility
between 3.1 and 3.2, this could be the last release of the 3.1 line.
</p>
<p>
For further details please check out:
</p>
<ul>

notes</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.psycopg.org/articles/2024/06/30/psycopg-32-released/">news
entry</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Please note that several new features in the 3.2 release require libpq
v17, but, because PostgreSQL version 17 has not been released yet, they
are not immediately available in the binary packages. In order to use
these features you will need a development version of libpq 17 on your
system and to use the Python or C source distribution. New packages
bundling libpq v17 will be released as soon as the official PostgreSQL
17 has been released.
</p>
<p>
Thank you very much to everyone who contributed to the project,
especially to Denis Laxalde from
<a href="https://www.dalibo.com/">Dalibo</a>, indefatigable libpq
explorer and always available to solve challenging problems!

<h2 id="pg_dumpbinary-v2.18-released">pg_dumpbinary v2.18 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-01, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
<strong>Grenoble, France - June 22, 2024</strong>
</p>
<h2>
pg_dumpbinary
</h2>
<p>
<code>pg_dumpbinary</code> dumps a PostgreSQL database to a binary
format. The resulting dump must be restored using
<code>pg_restorebinary</code>, which is provided.
</p>
<p>
This is a maintenance release that fixes two bugs in the restore
process.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Fix double copy statements when a table name requires to be quoted.
</li>
<li>
Fix error when restoring a table with a GENERATED ALWAYS column.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<code>pg_dumpbinary</code> is useful when:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You have bytea that can not be exported by <code>pg_dump</code> because
the total size of the escape/hex output exceeds 1Gb.
</li>
<li>
You have custom type that stores <code>\0</code> internally in bytea but
data are exported by pg_dump as char/varchar/text. In this case pg_dump
truncates all data after the first <code>\0</code>, resulting in data
loss.
</li>
<li>
Other cases where a binary output format is useful.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In these kinds of cases <code>pg_dumpbinary</code> helps by dumping the
PostgreSQL database in a binary format. In all other cases the
pg_dump/pg_restore commands distributed with PostgreSQL are preferred.
</p>
<p>
See the documentation for a more complete description of available
features.

<p>date: 2024-07-01, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<h1>
Greenmask v0.2.0b1 Release
</h1>
<h2>
PostgreSQL Logical Dump and Anonymization Tool
</h2>
<p>
This major <strong>beta release</strong> introduces new features and
refactored transformers, significantly enhancing Greenmask’s flexibility
to better meet business needs. Help us improve GreenMask and tailor it
to meet community needs. We welcome your feedback in the
<a href="https://github.com/GreenmaskIO/greenmask/discussions/129">release
discussion on GitHub</a>.
</p>
<h2>
Greenmask Overview
</h2>
<p>
Greenmask is a versatile open-source tool for database backup,
anonymization, and restoration. Written in pure Go with ported
PostgreSQL libraries, it is platform-independent and stateless,
requiring no schema modifications. It is customizable and compatible
with existing PostgreSQL utilities.
</p>
<h3>
Greenmask is ideally suited for:
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Routine backup and restoration tasks, ensuring data integrity and
availability.
</li>
<li>
Anonymization and data masking for staging environments and analytics,
<strong>protecting sensitive</strong> information while maintaining data
utility.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Key features
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Deterministic transformers</strong> — deterministic approach to
data transformation based on the hash functions. This ensures that the
same input data will always produce the same output data. Almost each
transformer supports either <code>random</code> or <code>hash</code>
engine making it universal for any use case.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Dynamic parameters</strong> — almost each transformer supports
dynamic parameters, allowing to parametrize the transformer dynamically
from the table column value. This is helpful for resolving the
functional dependencies between columns and satisfying the constraints.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Database type safe</strong> - Ensures data integrity by
validating data and utilizing the database driver for encoding and
decoding operations. This approach guarantees the preservation of data
formats.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Transformation validation and easy maintainable</strong> -
During obfuscation development, Greenmask provides validation warnings
and a transformation diff feature, allowing you to monitor and maintain
transformations effectively throughout the software lifecycle.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Partitioned tables transformation inheritance</strong> - Define
transformation configurations once and apply them to all partitions
within partitioned tables, simplifying the obfuscation process.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Stateless</strong> - Greenmask operates as a logical dump and
does not impact your existing database schema.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Backward compatible</strong> - It fully supports the same
features and protocols as existing vanilla PostgreSQL utilities. Dumps
created by Greenmask can be successfully restored using the pg_restore
utility.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Extensible</strong> - Users have the flexibility to implement
domain-based transformations in any programming language or use
predefined templates.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Provide a variety of storage</strong> - Greenmask offers a
variety of storage options for local and remote data storage, including
directories and S3-like storage solutions.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Playground usage for the beta version
</h2>
<p>
If you want to run a Greenmask
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/playground/">playground</a> for
the beta version execute:
</p>
<p>
<code>git checkout tags/v0.2.0b1 -b v0.2.0b1 docker-compose run
greenmask-from-source</code>
</p>
<h2>
Changes overview
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/dynamic_parameters/">Introduced
dynamic parameters in the transformers</a>
<ul>
<li>
Most transformers now support dynamic parameters where applicable.
</li>
<li>
Dynamic parameters are strictly enforced. If you need to cast values to
another type, Greenmask provides templates and predefined cast functions
accessible via <code>cast_to</code>. These functions cover frequent
operations such as <code>UnixTimestampToDate</code> and
<code>IntToBool</code>.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
The transformation logic has been significantly refactored, making
transformers more customizable and flexible than before.
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/transformation_engines/">Introduced
transformation engines</a>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>random</code> - generates transformer values based on
pseudo-random algorithms.
</li>
<li>
<code>hash</code> - generates transformer values using hash functions.
Currently, it utilizes <code>sha3</code> hash functions, which are
secure but perform slowly. In the stable release, there will be an
option to choose between <code>sha3</code> and <code>SipHash</code>.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/parameters_templating/">Introduced
static parameters value template</a>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Notable changes
</h2>
<h3>
Core
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Introduced the <code>Parametrizer</code> interface, now implemented for
both dynamic and static parameters.
</li>
<li>
Renamed most of the toolkit types for enhanced clarity and comprehensive
documentation coverage.
</li>
<li>
Refactored the <code>Driver</code> initialization logic.
</li>
<li>
Added validation warnings for overridden types in the
<code>Driver</code>.
</li>
<li>
Migrated existing built-in transformers to utilize the new
<code>Parametrizer</code> interface.
</li>
<li>
Implemented a new abstraction, <code>TransformationContext</code>, as
the first step towards enabling new feature transformation conditions
(#34).
</li>
<li>
Optimized most transformers for performance in both dynamic and static
modes. While dynamic mode offers flexibility, static mode ensures
performance remains high. Using only the necessary transformation
features helps keep transformation time predictable.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Documentation
</h3>
<p>
Documentation has been significantly refactored. New information about
features and updates to transformer descriptions have been added.
</p>
<h3>
Transformers
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_email/">RandomEmail</a>
- Introduces a new transformer that supports both random and
deterministic engines. It allows for flexible email value generation;
you can use column values in the template and choose to keep the
original domain or select any from the <code>domains</code> parameter.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/noise_date/">NoiseDate</a>,

- These transformers support both random and deterministic engines,
offering dynamic mode parameters that control the noise thresholds
within the <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> range. Unlike previous
implementations which used a single <code>ratio</code> parameter, the
new release features <code>min_ratio</code> and <code>max_ratio</code>
parameters to define noise values more precisely. Utilizing the
<code>hash</code> engine in these transformers enhances security by
complicating statistical analysis for attackers, especially when the
same salt is used consistently over long periods.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/noise_numeric/">NoiseNumeric</a>
- A newly implemented transformer, sharing features with
<code>NoiseInt</code> and <code>NoiseFloat</code>, but specifically
designed for numeric values (large integers or floats). It provides a
<code>decimal</code> parameter to handle values with fractions.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_choice/">RandomChoice</a>

<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_int/">RandomInt</a>
- Now enhanced with hash engine support. Threshold parameters
<code>min</code> and <code>max</code> have been updated to support
dynamic mode, allowing for more flexible configurations.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_numeric/">RandomNumeric</a>
- A new transformer specifically designed for numeric types (large
integers or floats), sharing similar features with
<code>RandomInt</code> and <code>RandomFloat</code>, but tailored for
handling huge numeric values.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_string/">RandomString</a>
- Now supports hash engine mode
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_unix_timestamp/">RandomUnixTimestamp</a>
- This new transformer generates Unix timestamps with selectable units
(<code>second</code>, <code>millisecond</code>,
<code>microsecond</code>, <code>nanosecond</code>). Similar in function
to <code>RandomDate</code>, it supports the hash engine and dynamic
parameters for <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> thresholds, with
the ability to override these units using <code>min_unit</code> and
<code>max_unit</code> parameters.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_uuid/">RandomUuid</a>
- Added hash engine support
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/standard_transformers/random_person/">RandomPerson</a>
- Implemented a new transformer that replaces <code>RandomName</code>,
<code>RandomLastName</code>, <code>RandomFirstName</code>,
<code>RandomFirstNameMale</code>, <code>RandomFirstNameFemale</code>,
<code>RandomTitleMale</code>, and <code>RandomTitleFemale</code>. This
new transformer offers enhanced customizability while providing similar
functionalities as the previous versions. It generates personal data
such as <code>FirstName</code>, <code>LastName</code>, and
<code>Title</code>, based on the provided <code>gender</code> parameter,
which now supports dynamic mode. Future minor versions will allow for
overriding the default names database.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Added
<a href="https://greenmask.io/v0.2.0b1/built_in_transformers/advanced_transformers/custom_functions/core_functions/#tsmodify">tsModify</a>

takes firm stance against AI, will not include it in its browser</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>The web browser Vivaldi is taking a firm stance against including
machine learning tools to its browser. So, as we have seen, LLMs are
essentially confident-sounding lying machines with a penchant to
occasionally disclose private data or plagiarise existing work. While
they do this, they also use vast amounts of energy and are happy using
all the GPUs you can throw at them which is a problem we’ve seen before
in the field of cryptocurrencies. As such, it does not feel right to
bundle any such solution into Vivaldi. There is enough misinformation
going around to risk adding more to the pile. We will not use an LLM to
add a chatbot, a summarization solution or a suggestion engine to fill
up forms for you until more rigorous ways to do those things are
available. ↫ Julien Picalausa on the Vivaldi blog I’m not a particular
fan of Vivaldi personally – it doesn’t integrate with KDE well visually
and its old-fashioned-Opera approach of throwing everything but the
kitchen sink at itself is just too cluttered for me – but props to the
Vivaldi team for taking such clear and firm stance. There’s a ton of
pressure from big money interests to add machine learning to everything
from your operating system to your nail scissors, and popular tech
publishers are certainly going to publish articles decrying Vivaldi’s
choice, so they’re not doing this without any risk. With even Firefox
adding machine learning tools to the browser, there’s very few – if any
– browsers left, other than Vivaldi, it seems – that will be free of
these tools. I can only hope we’re going to see a popular Firefox fork
without this nonsense take off, and I’m definitely keeping my eye on the
various options that already exist today.</p>

a practical analysis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>Straight from the arcade world, the Neo Geo was, without a doubt, the
most expensive hardware of the 4th generation. This begs the question:
how capable was it and how did it compare with the rest? In this entry,
we’ll take a look at the result of one company (SNK) setting budget
restrictions aside and shipping a product meant to please both arcade
owners and rich households. ↫ Rodrigo Copetti Rich households, indeed.
Back in the ’90s, when Nintendo was the only game in town – few people
in my area cared one bit about Sega – Neo Geo was a name we only knew of
vaguely. It was supposed to be a massively powerful console that was so
expensive nobody bought one, and some of us even doubted it was real in
the first place. Ah, the pre-internet playground days were wild.</p>

id="lgbtq-pride-month-culminates-with-parades-in-new-york-san-francisco-and-beyond">LGBTQ+
Pride Month culminates with parades in New York, San Francisco and
beyond</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — The monthlong celebration of LGBTQ+ Pride reached its
exuberant grand finale on Sunday, bringing rainbow-laden revelers to the
streets for marquee parades in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and
elsewhere across the globe.</p>
<p>The wide-ranging festivities functioned as both jubilant parties and
political protests, as participants recognize the community’s gains
while also calling attention to recent anti-LGBTQ+ laws, such as bans on
transgender health care, passed by Republican-led states.</p>
<p>“We’re at a time where there’s a ton of legislation, anti-LGBTQ+
legislation,” Zach Overton, 47, said at the New York parade. “It feels
like we’re taking a step backwards in the fight for equality and so it’s
a great moment to come out and be with our community and see all the
different colors of the spectrum of our community and remind ourselves
what we’re all fighting for.”</p>
<p>Thousands of people gathered along New York’s Fifth Avenue to
celebrate Pride. Floats cruised the street as Diane Ross’ “I’m Coming
Out” played from loudspeakers. Pride flags filled the horizon, and signs
in support of Puerto Rico, Ukraine and Gaza were visible in the
crowd.</p>
<p>This year, tensions over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza are also seeped
into the celebrations, exposing divisions within a community that is
often aligned on political issues.</p>
<p>Protesters temporarily blocked the New York parade on Sunday,
chanting: “Free, free, free Palestine!” Police eventually took some of
them away.</p>
<p>Pro-Palestinian activists disrupted pride parades earlier in June in
Boston, Denver, and Philadelphia. Several groups participating in
marches Sunday said they would seek to center the victims of the war in
Gaza, spurring pushback from supporters of Israel.</p>
<p>“It is certainly a more active presence this year in terms of protest
at Pride events,” said Sandra Perez, the executive director of NYC
Pride. “But we were born out of a protest.”</p>
<p>The first pride march was held in New York City in 1970 to
commemorate the one-year anniversary of the Stonewall Inn uprising, a
riot that began with a police raid on a Manhattan gay bar.</p>
<p>Nick Taricco, 47, who was at the New York parade with Overton, said
he attended Friday’s opening of the Stonewall National Monument Visitor
Center, where President Joe Biden spoke. Taricco said he has concerns
about politics in the U.S., including the presidential election.</p>
<p>“Even given how old he is, I still think that’s the direction we need
to go in,” Taricco said of Biden. “But it’s a very uncertain time in
general in this country.”</p>
<p>Ireland Fernandez-Cosgrove, 23, celebrated at the New York
parade.</p>
<p>“New York City is a great place to live, but this is one of the only
days where you can come out and be openly queer and you know you’re
going to be OK and safe about it,” she said. “I came out here today with
my partner to be able to be ourselves in public and know that other
people are going to be supporting us.”</p>
<p>In addition to the NYC Pride March, the nation’s largest, the city
also played host Sunday to the Queer Liberation March, an
activism-centered event launched five years ago amid concerns that the
more mainstream parade had become too corporate.</p>
<p>Another one of the world’s largest Pride celebrations also took place
Sunday in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of revelers packed sidewalks along Chicago’s
parade, a scaled-back event from previous years. City officials
shortened the North Side route and the number of floats this year from
199 to about 150 over safety and logistical concerns, including to
better deploy police into evening hours as post-parade parties have
become more disruptive in recent years. Chicago’s parade, one of the
largest in the U.S., routinely draws about 1 million people, according
to the city. Sunday’s crowd estimates were not immediately
available.</p>
<p>Additional parades were scheduled in Minneapolis and Seattle.</p>
<p>On top of concerns about protests, federal agencies have warned that
foreign terrorist organizations and their supporters could target the
parades and adjacent venues. A heavy security presence was expected at
all of the events.</p>

- Iran’s US ballot station plan sees mixed results as some venues cancel
voting events</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Iran’s plan to run absentee voter ballot stations in
more than 30 U.S. cities for the first round of its presidential
election had mixed results, a VOA investigation has found.</p>
<p>Information obtained and reviewed by VOA indicates that absentee
voting events were held on Friday in at least half of the 33 venues
displayed on a list of U.S. ballot stations published online by Iran’s
interests section office in Washington.</p>
<p>But the voting operation also suffered setbacks, with three of the
listed venues canceling their voting events on Friday under pressure
from Iranian American activists and protesters who oppose Iran’s
authoritarian Islamist rulers.</p>
<p>Organizers responded to two of the cancelations by updating the list
of ballot stations to show last-minute switches to alternate venues.</p>
<p>The most prominent absentee voting site was Washington’s Iranian
interests section office, where a VOA Persian reporter observed about 35
people arriving to vote in a nine-hour period. Dozens of protesters
shouted at the voters, accusing them of supporting an Iranian government
that oppresses its people and legitimizing a sham election whose only
candidates were loyalists of Iran’s supreme leader.</p>
<p>In addition to Washington, VOA assessed that voting events were held
at 18 sites on Iran’s list of ballot stations. VOA obtained verbal
confirmations in Friday phone calls to staff at 12 hotels on the list
and vetted activists’ images of the other six venues.</p>
<p>The 12 hotels included four Hilton properties in Lincoln, Nebraska,
Long Island City, New York, Milpitas, California and Seattle,
Washington; four Hyatt properties in Dallas, Texas, Fort Lee, New
Jersey, Houston, Texas and Raleigh, North Carolina; two Marriott
properties in Cleveland, Ohio and Mesa, Arizona; an IHG property in
Chicago, Illinois; and the Savai Hotel in Overland Park, Kansas.</p>
<p>Social media videos indicated that two additional hotels hosted
ballot stations despite hotel staff saying they had no knowledge of such
activity.</p>
<p>Multiple videos posted to X and sent to VOA by activists showed an
entrance to one hotel, Hilton’s DoubleTree in Gaithersburg, Maryland,
where several Iranians could be seen standing outside and exiting the
building as activists in the parking lot verbally berated them for
participating in the election.</p>
<p>A DoubleTree manager contacted by phone and informed of the videos
maintained that the hotel was not being used as a ballot station.</p>
<p>The other hotel, Choice Hotel’s Comfort Inn Sandy Springs in Atlanta,
Georgia, appeared in a mobile phone video posted to X. An activist
holding the phone walked into the hotel and entered a function room
serving as a ballot station, interacting with the Iranian attendants
before apparently being told to leave.</p>
<p>A hotel staff member who answered the phone said he had “no idea”
about the event.</p>
<p>Two other ballot station venues were seen in social media images
showing that voting activity had taken place for several hours before
being canceled in the face of protests. Organizers relocated one of the
venues to a third ballot station.</p>
<p>Activists outside the Ontario Airport Hotel &amp; Conference Center
in California were seen shouting at several Iranians who showed up to
vote on Friday morning before the hotel canceled the event at around 11
a.m. local time. A staff member who answered the phone confirmed the
cancelation, which prompted the venue’s removal from an updated version
of Iran’s ballot station list.</p>
<p>Another group of activists outside The Congregational Church of
Weston in Massachusetts were seen in a video posted on X. The activists
jeered at a car leaving the site and cheered when a police officer told
them that organizers were preparing to shut down the ballot station.</p>
<p>An updated Friday version of Iran’s ballot station list showed the
Weston venue was replaced by an Islamic center in Milford,
Massachusetts. A photo posted to X showed an Iranian voting notice on
the center’s front door, indicating that it also was used as a ballot
station.</p>
<p>A sixth venue where voting activity appeared on social media was an
office building of Easterns Automotive Group, a used car dealership in
Sterling, Virginia. A video posted to X showed a man walking up to the
entrance as a guard opened the door, which displayed an Iranian election
notice.</p>
<p>A review of Friday updates to Iran’s ballot station list showed the
Sterling venue replaced the nearby Hilton McLean Tysons Corner hotel,
which had been listed earlier as a ballot station before its station
number was removed from the list. Siamak Aram, an activist with the
National Solidarity Group for Iran, told VOA that his group had
contacted the hotel to urge cancelation of the voting event. A hotel
staffer who answered the phone confirmed that the event was not on
Friday’s schedule.</p>
<p>Iran’s ballot station list contained another three hotels and an
event hall for which there were no confirmations of voting activity from
staff contacted by phone and no social media images of such events found
by VOA. They included a Hilton hotel in Rancho Cordova, California, an
IHG hotel in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the Biltmore Hotel Oklahoma and The
Rose Court event hall in Tampa, Florida.</p>
<p>The remaining nine venues on the ballot station list included four
Islamic centers in Detroit, Michigan, Manassas, Virginia, Minneapolis,
Minnesota, and Portland, Oregon. The others were a landscaping company
in Buffalo, New York, and four Virginia and Maryland locations that a
mobile voting station was slated to visit during the day.</p>
<p>The addresses of all the U.S. ballot stations besides Iran’s
interests section office only began to appear online as voting began on
Friday morning. In almost all cases, the addresses were displayed as
street names and numbers, without the venues being named. The entire
list was deleted on Saturday.</p>
<p>“The Islamic Republic and its agents understand that the regime is
deeply unpopular in the Iranian diaspora, whose members are channeling
the voices of their Iran-based compatriots calling for regime change,”
said Jason Brodsky, policy director of U.S. advocacy group United
Against Nuclear Iran, in a VOA interview.</p>
<p>“The regime and its agents fear the Iranian diaspora because of its
organizing power, so they want to keep this U.S. voting activity as
quiet as possible to prevent embarrassing situations in which their
fellow Iranians denounce the election for the sham that it is,” Brodsky
said.</p>
<p>Soran Khateri of VOA’s Persian Service contributed to this
report.</p>

<h2 id="the-mimo-diaries-feedback-and-directory">The Mimo Diaries:
Feedback and Directory</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-30, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Another quick update for those who are interested on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://minimalissimo.com&quot;&gt;Minimalissimo&lt;/a&gt; side of my digital life. For those who don’t know, at the beginning of 2024 I took charge of Minimalissimo and I’m now curating it, updating it, designing and coding for it, and steering it towards its future. It’s a fun project to work on and I have a ton of ideas but also very little time. It’s a one man show and there’s a lot to do.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Today I pushed live a
<a href="https://minimalissimo.com/feedback">feedback page</a> because I
have a couple of decisions to take and I don’t want to do it blindly. So
if you are a reader of the site I’d really appreciate if you can take a
moment and share your thoughts on a few subjects. It shouldn’t take too
long, maybe 5 minutes at most.
</p>
<p>
The other thing I’ve been working on is a new directory that collects in
one place links to people and brands that are aligned with the
Minimalissimo vision. It’s something that’s incredibly useful for me to
have online because it will make the curation of the site easier and
that’s huge because curation can be very time consuming.

</div>
</figure>
<p>
The directory is ready form a technical point of view but now I need to
add content to it and that will take me some time. I have more than a
thousand links to go through and my hope is to have it live before the
end of the summer. We’ll see how it goes.

id="expanding-extremist-groups-in-africa-fuel-worries-that-they-could-attack-the-us-allies">Expanding
extremist groups in Africa fuel worries that they could attack the US,
allies</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>GABORONE, Botswana — Violent extremist groups linked to al-Qaida and
the Islamic State group are growing in size and influence across Africa,
fueling worries that as they improve their tactics they could attack the
U.S. or Western allies.</p>
<p>U.S. defense and military officials described the threats and their
concerns about growing instability in Africa, where a number of coups
have put ruling juntas in control, leading to the ouster of American
troops and a decline in U.S. intelligence gathering.</p>
<p>“Threats like Wagner, terrorist groups and transnational criminal
organizations continue to sow instability in multiple regions,” Air
Force Gen. CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in
opening remarks Tuesday at a conference of African chiefs of defense in
Botswana. “I think we can all agree, what happens in one part of the
world, does not stay in one part of the world.”</p>
<p>Wagner is the Russian mercenary group that has gone into African
nations to provide security as Western forces, including from the U.S.
and France, have been pushed out. The group is known for its brutality,
and human rights organizations have accused its members of raping and
killing civilians.</p>
<p>While Brown only touched briefly on the terror threat in the region,
it was a key topic among others at the conference and spurred questions
from military chiefs in the audience after his speech. They wanted to
know what the U.S. could do to help stem the spread of insurgents in
West Africa, the Gulf of Guinea and the Sahel.</p>
<p>This is the first time that the chiefs of defense conference has been
held on African soil. And it is the first time the U.S. joint chiefs
chairman has visited a sub-Saharan country since 1994, when Gen. John
Shalikashvili visited Rwanda and Zaire.</p>
<p>A senior U.S. defense official said al-Qaida linked groups — such as
al-Shabab in Somalia and Jama’a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin, known as
JNIM, in the Sahel region — are the largest and most financially viable
insurgencies. JNIM is active in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger and is
looking to expand into Benin and Togo, which it uses as hubs to rest,
recuperate, get financing and gather weapons but also has increased
attacks there.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Islamic State group has key cells in West
Africa and in the Sahel. The defense official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity to discuss a threat assessment, said the Islamic State cells
were getting increasing direction from the group’s leadership that
relocated to northern Somalia. That has included how to kidnap
Westerners for ransom, how to learn better military tactics, how to hide
from drones and how to building their own small quadcopters.</p>
<p>A U.S. military airstrike in Somalia on May 31 targeted Islamic State
militants and killed three, according to U.S. Africa Command. U.S.
officials have said the strike targeted the group’s leader, but the
defense official said Monday that it’s still unclear if he was
killed.</p>
<p>Roughly 200 Islamic State insurgents are in Somalia, so they are
vastly outnumbered by al-Shabab, which has grown in size to between
10,000 and 12,000.</p>
<p>The growth of the insurgent groups within Africa signals the belief
by both al-Qaida and the Islamic State group that the continent is a
ripe location for jihadism, where extremist ideology can take root and
expand, the official said.</p>
<p>And it comes as the U.S. was ordered to pull out its 1,000 troops
from Niger in the wake of last July’s coup and also about 75 from Chad.
Those troop cuts, which shut down a critical U.S. counterterrorism and
drone base at Agadez, hamper intelligence gathering in Niger, said
Gen. Michael Langley, head of U.S. Africa Command.</p>
<p>Surveillance operations before the coup gave the U.S. a greater
ability to get intelligence on insurgent movements. Now, he said, the
key goal is a safe and secure withdrawal of personnel and equipment from
both Agadez and a smaller U.S. facility near the airport.</p>
<p>Langley met with Niger’s top military chief, Brig. Gen. Moussa Salaou
Barmou, during the conference, and said military-to-military
communications continue but that it’s yet to be determined how much the
new transitional government will deal with the U.S.</p>
<p>Currently, he said, there are about 400 troops still at Agadez and
200 near the airport.</p>
<p>But, he added that “as we’re in transition and resetting, we need to
maintain capabilities to get enough intelligence to identify warnings of
a threat out there.”</p>
<p>Langley said the U.S. is still trying to assess the militant groups’
capabilities as they grow.</p>
<p>“Yes, they’ve been growing in number. Have they been growing in
capability where they can do what we call external ops attacks on the
homeland and attacks on allies, whether we’re talking about Europe or
anyone? That’s what we closely watch,” he said. “I’d say it has the
potential as they grow in numbers.”</p>
<p>Both Langley and Brown spoke more extensively about the need for the
U.S. and African nations to communicate more effectively and work
together to solve security and other problems.</p>
<p>And Brown acknowledged that the U.S. needs to “do better at
understanding the perspectives of others, ensuring their voices and
expertise don’t get drowned out.”</p>
<p>The U.S has struggled to maintain relations with African nations as
many foster growing ties to Russia and China.</p>
<p>Some African countries have expressed frustration with the U.S. for
forcing issues, such as democracy and human rights, that many see as
hypocrisy, given Washington’s close ties to some autocratic leaders
elsewhere. Meanwhile, Russia offers security assistance without
interfering in politics, making it an appealing partner for military
juntas that seized power in places like Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso in
recent years.</p>

protests mark the end of Pride month in US and beyond</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — The monthlong celebration of LGBTQ+ Pride reaches its
exuberant grand finale on Sunday, bringing rainbow-laden revelers to the
streets for marquee parades in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and
elsewhere across the globe.</p>
<p>The wide-ranging festivities will function as both jubilant parties
and political protests, as participants recognize the community’s gains
while also calling attention to recent anti-LGBTQ+ laws, such as bans on
transgender health care, passed by Republican-led states.</p>
<p>This year, tensions over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza are also
seeping into the celebrations, exposing divisions within a community
that is often aligned on political issues.</p>
<p>Already this month, pro-Palestinian activists have disrupted pride
parades held in Boston, Denver, and Philadelphia. Several groups
participating in marches Sunday said they would seek to center the
victims of the war in Gaza, spurring pushback from supporters of
Israel.</p>
<p>“It is certainly a more active presence this year in terms of protest
at Pride events,” said Sandra Pérez, the executive director of NYC
Pride. “But we were born out of a protest.”</p>
<p>The first pride march was held in New York City in 1970 to
commemorate the one-year anniversary of the Stonewall Inn uprising, a
riot that began with a police raid on a Manhattan gay bar.</p>
<p>In addition to the NYC Pride March, the nation’s largest, the city
will also play host Sunday to the Queer Liberation March, an
activism-centered event launched five years ago amid concerns that the
more mainstream parade had become too corporate.</p>
<p>Another one of the world’s largest Pride celebrations will also kick
off Sunday in San Francisco. Additional parades are scheduled in
Chicago, Minneapolis, and Seattle.</p>
<p>On top of concerns about protests, federal agencies have warned that
foreign terrorist organizations and their supporters could target the
parades and adjacent venues. A heavy security presence is expected at
all of the events.</p>

id="san-francisco-store-is-shipping-lgbtq-books-to-places-where-they-are-banned">San
Francisco store is shipping LGBTQ+ books to places where they are
banned</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO — In an increasingly divisive political sphere, Becka
Robbins focuses on what she knows best — books.</p>
<p>Operating out of a tiny room in Fabulosa Books in San Francisco’s
Castro District, one of the oldest gay neighborhoods in the United
States, Robbins uses donations from customers to ship boxes of books
across the country to groups that want them.</p>
<p>In an effort she calls “Books Not Bans,” she sends titles about queer
history, sexuality, romance and more — many of which are increasingly
hard to come by in the face of a rapidly growing movement by
conservative advocacy groups and lawmakers to ban them from public
schools and libraries.</p>
<p>“The book bans are awful, the attempt at erasure,” Robbins said. She
asked herself how she could get these books into the hands of the people
who need them the most.</p>
<p>Beginning last May, she started raising money and looking for
recipients. Her books have gone to places like a pride center in west
Texas and an LGBTQ-friendly high school in Alabama.</p>
<p>Customers are especially enthusiastic about helping Robbins send
books to places in states like Florida, Texas and Oklahoma, often
writing notes of support to include in the packages. Over 40% of all
book bans from July 2022 to June 2023 were in Florida, more than any
other state. Behind Florida are Texas and Missouri, according to a
report by PEN America, a nonprofit literature advocacy group.</p>
<p>Book bans and attempted bans have been hitting record highs,
according to the American Library Association. And the efforts now
extend as much to public libraries as school libraries. Because the
totals are based on media accounts and reports submitted by librarians,
the association regards its numbers as snapshots, with many bans left
unrecorded.</p>
<p>PEN America’s report said 30% of the bans include characters of color
or discuss race and racism, and 30% have LGBTQ+ characters or
themes.</p>
<p>The most sweeping challenges often originate with conservative
organizations, such as Moms for Liberty, which has organized banning
efforts nationwide and called for more parental control over books
available to children.</p>
<p>Moms for Liberty is not anti-LGBTQ+, co-founder Tiffany Justice has
told The Associated Press. But about 38% of book challenges that
“directly originated” from the group have LGBTQ+ themes, according to
the library association’s Office for Intellectual Freedom. Justice said
Moms for Liberty challenges books that are sexually explicit, not
because they cover LGBTQ+ topics.</p>
<p>Among those topping banned lists have been Maia Kobabe’s Gender
Queer, George Johnson’s All Boys Aren’t Blue and Nobel laureate Toni
Morrison’s The Bluest Eye.</p>
<p>Robbins said it’s more important than ever to makes these kinds of
books available to everyone.</p>
<p>“Fiction teaches us how to dream,” Robbins said. “It teaches us how
to connect with people who are not like ourselves, it teaches us how to
listen and emphasize.”</p>
<p>She’s sent 740 books so far, with each box worth $300 to $400,
depending on the titles.</p>
<p>At the new Rose Dynasty Center in Lakeland, Florida, the books
donated by Fabulosa are already on the shelves, said Jason DeShazo, a
drag queen known as Momma Ashley Rose who runs the LGBTQ+ community
center.</p>
<p>DeShazo is a family-friendly drag performer and has long hosted drag
story times to promote literacy. He uses puppets to address themes of
being kind, dealing with bullies and giving back to the community.</p>
<p>DeShazo hopes to provide a safe space for events, support groups and
health clinics, and to build a library of banned books.</p>
<p>“I don’t think a person of color should have to search so hard for an
amazing book about history of what our Black community has gone
through,” DeShazo said. “Or for someone who is queer to find a book that
represents them.”</p>
<p>Robbins’ favorite books to send are youth adult queer romances, a
rapidly growing genre as conversations about LGBTQ+ issues have become
much more mainstream than a decade ago.</p>
<p>“The characters are just like regular kids — regular people who are
also queer, but they also get to fall in love and be happy,” Robbins
said.</p>

id="schools-out-and-nyc-migrant-families-face-a-summer-of-uncertainty">School’s
out and NYC migrant families face a summer of uncertainty</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — When Damien Carchipulla started his first school year in
New York City in September, the first grader’s family was living in a
Manhattan hotel for migrant families.</p>
<p>In the 10 months since, the family of four from Ecuador has moved
shelters three times under a policy Mayor Eric Adams imposed in the fall
that limits the number of days migrants can stay in a single place.
Every 60 days they must give up their shelter beds and reapply for
housing or leave the system.</p>
<p>With a fourth move expected in a matter of weeks, Damien’s mother
Kimberly Carchipulla hopes the family isn’t pulled too far from the
6-year-old’s school in Harlem this summer. Her son is set to attend a
summer program starting in July.</p>
<p>“A lot has changed because new laws were put in place,” Carchipulla
said in Spanish while picking up Damien after school one day. “They get
stressed. They get upset. Every 60 days, it’s a new home.”</p>
<p>The New York City school year ended Wednesday, but for thousands of
migrant families the shuffle from shelter to shelter continues. With it
come the concerns about how they’ll navigate their children’s education
needs, both this summer and into the next school year.</p>
<p>“These families were already coming in with a great deal of trauma,
which was impacting their children’s attendance at school and their
ability to engage once they’re there,” said Sarah Jonas, a vice
president at Children’s Aid, a nonprofit that provides mentoring, health
services and after-school programs at city schools. “With that added
burden of the 60-day rule, we’ve seen even more disruption for our
families getting these eviction notices and all of the anxiety that
comes with that.”</p>
<p>Like the Carchipullas, most families chose to stick with the same
school through the year, even if they were reassigned to shelters in a
different part of the city. The tradeoff for many was longer and more
complex commutes, leading to children who were exhausted before the
school day even started. Absenteeism spiked too, as parents struggled to
get their children to school on time.</p>
<p>Carchipulla, who is 23, counts her family among the lucky ones: the
three moves they made during the school year were all to other midtown
Manhattan hotels, so her son’s daily commute remained relatively the
same.</p>
<p>For the grandchildren of Rosie Arias, the moves were more
disruptive.</p>
<p>The 55-year-old from Ecuador said her daughter arrived in January
with her 10-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter. They were immediately
placed in a shelter and enrolled in a local school where Spanish was
widely spoken.</p>
<p>But when their 60 days ran out, they had to move to another shelter
and transfer to another school, Arias said. Then when the family secured
their own apartment in Brooklyn, the children had to switch schools
again, this time to a smaller one where few people spoke Spanish.</p>
<p>“As a grandmother, I’m worried. The children don’t want to go to
school. They’re not adjusting because of the language and because they
don’t have friends.,” Arias said in Spanish. “They cry.”</p>
<p>School officials didn’t have a final tally for how many migrant
students were affected by the shelter time limits.</p>
<p>As of the first week of May, 44% of migrant students had remained in
the same shelter and same school since February 14, according to Tamara
Mair, a senior director with Project Open Arms, the district’s program
supporting asylum seekers and other new students in temporary
housing.</p>
<p>Another 40% of migrant students moved shelters but remained enrolled
at the same school, while 4% moved both schools and shelters, she said.
Roughly 10% left the school system entirely, with the “vast majority” of
those dropping out because they left the city.</p>
<p>District officials will be keeping tabs on migrant families in the
shelters through the summer, Mair said.</p>
<p>“The one thing we want to remain constant for our kids is school,”
she said. “But we also want to support our families with their choices,
because the families have the right to remain in their school, or they
may choose to go to a new school closer to their new residence.”</p>
<p>Adams, a Democrat, instituted shelter limits to encourage migrant
families to leave the city’s emergency shelter system, which includes
huge tent shelters and converted hotels that have swollen with thousands
of newcomers to the U.S.</p>
<p>Over the summer, more needs to be done to prepare newly arriving
families for the next school year, immigrant advocates say.</p>
<p>That includes better outreach to migrant parents and more investment
in translation services, said Liza Schwartzwald, a director at the New
York Immigration Coalition.</p>
<p>Schools also need more specialists to assess and help get migrant
students up to grade level in their studies, said Natasha Quiroga,
director of education policy at the New School’s Center for New York
City Affairs.</p>
<p>Damien Carchipulla’s mother remains optimistic about her son’s
future.</p>
<p>Eventually, she said, the family hopes to save up enough money for
their own place, perhaps in Queens, where her husband recently found
steady work.</p>
<p>“He is learning more and more every day,” Kim Carchipulla said of her
son. “Even if he misses school, his teacher tells me, he catches up
quickly.”</p>

id="prosecutors-meet-with-boeing-victims-families-as-charging-decision-looms-say-sources">Prosecutors
meet with Boeing, victims’ families as charging decision looms, say
sources</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — U.S. prosecutors are meeting with Boeing and the families
of crash victims as a July 7 deadline looms for the Justice Department
to decide whether to criminally charge the plane maker, according to two
people familiar with the matter and correspondence reviewed by Reuters.
 </p>
<p>Justice Department officials met with Boeing lawyers on Thursday to
discuss the government’s finding that the company violated a 2021
agreement with the department, one of the sources said. That deal, known
as a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA), had shielded it from criminal
prosecution over two 737 MAX crashes in 2018 in Indonesia and a crash in
2019 in Ethiopia that together killed 346 people.  </p>
<p>Separately, federal prosecutors are slated to meet with victims’
family members on Sunday to update them on the progress of their
investigation, according to the second person. U.S. officials are
working on a “tight timeline,” according to an email sent by the DOJ and
reviewed by Reuters.  </p>
<p>Boeing lawyers present case</p>
<p>Boeing’s lawyers from Kirkland &amp; Ellis on Thursday presented
their case to officials from the Deputy Attorney General’s office that a
prosecution would be unwarranted and that there is no need to tear up
the 2021 deal, one of the people said. </p>
<p>Such appeals from companies in the DOJ’s crosshairs are typical when
negotiating to resolve a government investigation.  </p>
<p>Officials want input from family members as they consider how to
proceed, the email said. Prosecutors from the Justice Department’s
criminal fraud division and the U.S. attorney’s office in Dallas will
attend the Sunday meeting, it said. </p>
<p>Spokespeople for the DOJ and Boeing declined to comment. </p>
<p>Boeing has previously said it has “honored the terms” of the
settlement and formally told prosecutors it disagrees with the finding
that it violated the agreement.  </p>
<p>Prosecutors recommend criminal charges</p>
<p>U.S. prosecutors have recommended to senior Justice Department
officials that criminal charges be brought against Boeing after finding
the plane maker violated the 2021 settlement, two people familiar with
the matter previously told Reuters. </p>
<p>The two sides are in discussions over a potential resolution to the
Justice Department’s investigation, and there is no guarantee officials
will move forward with charges, they said last week.  </p>
<p>The deliberations follow a January 5 flight during which a panel blew
out on a Boeing plane just two days before the company’s DPA expired.
The incident exposed ongoing safety and quality issues at Boeing. </p>
<p>Boeing had been poised to escape prosecution over a criminal charge
of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration
arising from the 2018-2019 fatal crashes.  </p>
<p>Prosecutors had agreed to drop a criminal charge so long as Boeing
overhauled its compliance practices and submitted regular reports over a
three-year period. Boeing also agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle the
investigation. </p>
<p>In May, officials determined the company breached the agreement,
exposing Boeing to prosecution. The DOJ said in a court filing in Texas
that the plane maker had failed to “design, implement, and enforce a
compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the
U.S. fraud laws throughout its operations.”</p>

<h2 id="two-tiny-65816-dtv-consoles">Two tiny 65816 DTV consoles</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-30, from: Old Vintage Computer Research</p>
<p>The 21st century direct-to-TV game console: a dirt-cheap toy dragging
poor ports of cherished games to a more downmarket age. If you couldn’t
afford the real device, your alternative was these inexpensive,
inadequate facsimiles faithful only to one’s gauzy recollection. As
their chipsets are generally grossly underpowered and optimized solely
for cost, the vast majority didn’t even try to run the original games
precisely as they were, and the quality of the resulting rewrites
sometimes showed their software to be as rushed as the hardware. (Even
today, where true emulators are more plentiful, the SoCs these devices
use often still require compromise.) There were certainly standouts that
are practical miniatures of the original systems, notably the
<a href="https://www.commodore-info.com/article/item/c64dtv/en/desktop">Commodore
64 Direct-to-TV</a> and
<a href="https://flashback2.com/historical/">Atari Flashback 2</a>, but
the remainder during their zenith in the early 2000s were more like this
Intellivision and two Atari 2600 imposters, playing uneven resurrections
on unrelated silicon.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiY2K23gaDwZBcJivb3pDR7m5QBKs4MmpeEVrACyP-RqllRqhXIb8eJkrMyu9sQqUEXbkHBL0A622L5tWxJhOxNIzPHjgl49WCZvFV5efuGFw57MnGsYavQk1mc4GEngBAB5vTspDX45QqqhQVx2IEJlpIznuc2Rxwhu_qgXyRtchrBTHo_P4P4XQntQyE/s4080/PXL_20240620_000604841.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="3072" data-original-width="4080" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiY2K23gaDwZBcJivb3pDR7m5QBKs4MmpeEVrACyP-RqllRqhXIb8eJkrMyu9sQqUEXbkHBL0A622L5tWxJhOxNIzPHjgl49WCZvFV5efuGFw57MnGsYavQk1mc4GEngBAB5vTspDX45QqqhQVx2IEJlpIznuc2Rxwhu_qgXyRtchrBTHo_P4P4XQntQyE/s320/PXL_20240620_000604841.jpg"/></a>
</div>
But it turns out these three (and others) have something in common
besides the bargain bin: they’re all derived from our favourite chip,
the 6502. In fact, the two Atari imposters even embed the 6502’s 16-bit
descendant, the 65816. How do we know this? Rampant speculation, foggy
memory, datasheets and vidcaps — and taking them apart, of course.

I confess I fell into the DTV trap a couple times other than the C64
DTV, which is <a href="https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/C64DTV">enhanced
over the original</a> and really should be considered a distinct
Commodore computer of its own. I was Team Intellivision as a kid (we
went from an Atari Ultra Pong Doubles to a Tandyvision One), I got the
Intellvision Lives! CD for my Mac, and I figured the DTV version would
be a great cartridge-free small version. Instead, I ended up being so
disgusted with the abysmal quality of the ports that I’m pretty sure it
went in the <s>trash</s> electronics recycling almost immediately, or at
least I can’t find it anymore. Sometime ago I’d also got an AtGames
ColecoVision clone that was on sale, which also turned out to be crap
(sold it at a yard sale), and the convertible Tommo Neo Geo X which does
truly play in emulation but MAME was more convenient and so I found a
buyer for it. The only DTVs I ended up keeping were my modded C64 DTV
and a
<a href="https://www.commodore-info.com/computer/item/hummer/en/desktop">Hummer
direct-to-TV game</a> which is a later version of the C64 DTV hardware.
<p>
<p>Recently, however, someone mentioned the Winbond W55V9x series of
“TV-Toy” chips and this piqued my interest to see how hackable they
might be. But first let’s beat up on the Inty direct-to-TVs a bit more,
partially because I despise them in particular, but also because they
make a good technical lead-in.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;">

One of the most common architectures for early generation DTVs is the
so-called NES-on-a-chip (“NOAC”), which makes them little 6502s since
the Nintendo Entertainment System/Famicom was 6502-based, and the Inty
DTVs were all (near as I can determine) of this specific type.
Originally the various “Famiclones” made their own versions of the Ricoh
2A03/2A07 CPU (an NMOS 6502 with audio hardware and no decimal mode) and
2C02/2C07 PPU video chip, their clones of which were separate components
initially and later consolidated to reduce cost further. Such systems
were invariably accompanied by any required mapper hardware and ROMs.
The advantages of these clone chips were obvious — a community of people
already experienced in programming for them and an older chip that was
cheap to manufacture — and soon they appeared in all sorts of basic
applications like these beyond merely being knockoff NESes. The licensed
Inty DTVs came in various form factors differing pretty much only in
their shape, included games and menu interface.
<p>
<p>There is no loyalty to any particular architecture in DTVs because
cost is always the leading consideration. As such, notice the ominous
disclaimer on the box that I originally didn’t: “Original games have
been modified for optimal play on this device.” From a design
perspective, they already started in the hole because the NES
architecture was an especially bad fit for the Intellivision. Besides
the issue of an 8-bit CPU (the 6502) implementing games written for a
16-bit one (the Intellivision’s General Instrument CP1610), the NES PPU
maps somewhat poorly onto the Inty’s STIC video chip. The STIC can have
<a href="https://wiki.intellivision.us/index.php/STIC">independent
background and foreground colours</a> for each 8x8 “card,” but the PPU
only supports selecting colours from four pre-specified palettes in
<a href="https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/PPU_attribute_tables">groups of 4
tiles</a> (also 8x8 each), unless you use one of
<a href="https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/MMC5">the more sophisticated
mappers</a>. Moreover, the STIC generates a 159x96 (20x12 cards)
display, so you can’t get around that by doubling up on the PPU because
its display is 256x240 (32x30 tiles), though at least you’d have more
than enough pattern table overhead to support all 240 Inty on-screen
cards at once. Similarly, STIC sprites, eight per scanline, can all have
different colours and be dynamically stretched in hardware. Although the
PPU matches the sprites per scanline and allows multicoloured sprites,
it also does so off pre-specified palettes (modulo mapper) and doesn’t
have support for hardware resizing (i.e., for stretched sprites you’d
need additional precomputed sprite images). About the only thing that
did more or less directly port to NES hardware was the audio. While most
Inty games were simple enough to be translated with some thought, it so
happens that the NES PPU is not capable of accurately representing every
possible STIC frame, and it will become clear very quickly that the
programmers here didn’t use any thought anyway.</p>

<p>Intellivision Productions, then the owners of the Inty IP, licensed
various games and the trademark to Hong Kong-based Techno Source, who in
turn contracted out the software development to Chinese developer Nice
Code. Nice Code already had experience programming simple games for
famiclones and some of the work they did here turned up under other
names or with minor changes in other famiclone collections. (Later Inty
DTVs such as the X2 had games ported by an unknown Chinese firm instead
of Nice Code. However, they are still NOAC-based DTVs, and they still
sucked.)</p>

<p>On the top is the DTV version and on the bottom is a grab from my
usual GTE Sylvania Intellivision (ignore the red at the top, my TV tuner
box doesn’t like the picture even though it looks fine on my CRT games
TV). It makes sense they’d change the copyright message, and I’m
prepared to admit that at least <em>some</em> of the inaccurate colours
may be my capture box or problems with this specific unit (compare with
the contemporary
<a href="https://fcpic.nesbbs.com/GamePic.asp?gameid=7866">25 game
version</a>), but everything else is wrong. The font has incorrect
metrics, the digits in particular are vertically squashed, and they even
missed the exclamation point in the title. And let’s not forget that
pillarboxed background, either.</p>

It gets worse when you actually try to play (again, real system at the
bottom). The player sprite is double the size, the mountain background
is different and the stars look like clusters instead of points. The
meteors are also rendered incorrectly — my score is zero, I haven’t
actually shot anything — and game play is a strange combination of
weirdly jerky and unnervingly smooth, since the DTV’s sprite motion runs
approximately at NTSC 60fps yet the Intellivision EXEC animates sprites
at only 20fps. But the rotten smelly cherry on top of the fail sundae is
the mixed-up score panel once again featuring those obnoxiously bogus
digits. These aren’t trivial details! Seriously, did they make
<em>any</em> attempt to compare it with an actual Intellivision?
<p>
<p>The funny part is comparing this with the screenshots on the back of
the box, above, and even in the menu — which <em>are</em> correct, and
which were obviously taken from an actual Inty. Class action lawsuits
have been filed for less.</p>

<p>Astrosmash!’s poor conversion was sadly no fluke. Let’s move onto
Star Strike, a sometimes difficult but graphically impressive rail
shooter which spokesman George Plimpton infamously remarked contained
the “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPB3H_a234s">total
destruction of a planet</a>” (Earth, natch). Again, the problems start
immediately from the very first screen.</p>

<p>Even if we ignore the questionable palette — the stars are supposed
to be twinkling in various colours and I can barely make out the
continents on the planet — Earth doesn’t start in the middle, it’s
supposed to start on the side behind the moon. Also, because the PPU’s
screen geometry doesn’t match the STIC’s, we get a different perspective
background, and we still have those squished digits.</p>

What’s missing here that Nice Code mistakenly added? A “Game Over.” The
original game didn’t have it because what’s more game over than the
Earth being turned into crunchy little earth bits? (Likewise, when you
win and the trench space station crumbles to 8-bit dust, what’s more
“you won” than that?)

The giveaway that this is an NOAC is its prominent crystal oscillator at
the distinctive speed of 21.47727MHz, though the embedded 6502 is
definitely not running that fast. Instead, the NOAC (and the original
NES, which this is a clone of, remember) divides this crystal by six for
the standard NTSC colour subcarrier frequency of 3.579545MHz (i.e.,
315/88 MHz) used by the PPU and by twelve for the actual CPU clock of
1.789773MHz. This crystal by far is most commonly found in NES-derived
hardware, though it also appears in various obscure arcade machines and
the NEC PC Engine (a/k/a TurboGrafx-16) and derivatives, also a
6502-based game system. Conversely, PAL NOACs and NESes are based on a
26.601712MHz crystal divided by 8 and 16 respectively along the same
basic notion.
<p>
<p>But if that didn’t convince you, the markings on the board should.
Eight lines run to the controller board and A/V outputs. From right to
left (in this view) they are ground, power, sound, a reset line,
composite video — and then three NES-specific lines used to interface
with the controller board, <tt>OUT0</tt>, <tt>RD4016</tt> and
<tt>4016D0</tt>. NES controllers are read out
<a href="https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Controller_reading">bit by bit</a>
from locations $4016 and $4017 by writing to the control register, which
goes out to the controller on the <tt>OUT</tt> line to select it, and
then reading each bit (<tt>4016D0</tt>) on each clock (<tt>RD4016</tt>).
This has a single controller, so it only has lines for working with
$4016; the two player Inty DTVs have additional lines for $4017. It’s
fabulously unlikely two lines clearly labeled with that specific address
would be present if the underlying architecture weren’t NES-based.</p>

<p>The chip closest to the crystal appears to be the actual SoC. Its
pinout, such as it is, and the use of a single oscillator are both
consistent with the UM6561, a very common NOAC used in many games that
has its own internal clock generator. The other chip is essentially a
tiny multicart containing the PRG-ROM (code for the CPU) and CHR-ROM
(image data for the PPU) for the main menu and each game along with any
needed mapper(s). As the two chips are connected by what is more or less
a hardwired NES cartridge port, it is possible, albeit after some work,
to <a href="https://forums.nesdev.org/viewtopic.php?t=24758">dump its
contents</a>.</p>

If we pull out the controller board with two more screws and turn it
over, we find one more IC also under globtop epoxy that appears to be a
UM6582. This chip provides the controller data for the 6561 using those
three NES-specific lines. It supports “turbo” (rapidfire) for the A/B
buttons (if you press turbo A or B, it triggers A or B plus a separate
turbo line), and the chip can perform rapidfire at three different
speeds, but only the basic “turbo” speed appears to be connected here.
The shoulder triggers are wired into the same A/B button lines on the
6582 with separate buttons for select, start and reset; the reset line
is fed directly to the 6561 through that 8-pin connector.
<p>
That’s the basics of a NOAC-based DTV and a particularly unadorned
example. We’re going to use it as a point of comparison for the
remainder of the article, but I promised you 16-bit DTVs, and now I’ll
bring you two — maybe even three.
<p>
<p>Compared to the 6502 the 65816 got comparatively few design wins
(though, in fairness, the 6502 got a <em>lot</em> of design wins), and
consequently is a much less frequently embedded processor. The two major
systems with a 65816 were the Apple IIgs, for which it was designed, and
the Super Nintendo, but what we’re about to talk about is most
definitely <em>not</em> a Super NES-on-a-chip. Let’s meet the Winbond
W55V91.</p>

<p>Winbond calls this chip a “TV-toy Controller.” It is an entire SoC
with a 65C816 core licensed from the Western Design Center, plus on-chip
video, sound, ROM, RAM and I/O. (We’re talking about it like it’s a
single chip, and the data sheet only ever depicts it as a single chip,
but I’ll drop a spoiler now that this is not the case for the units
we’ll look at.)</p>

The initial W55V91 supports up to 1152K of ROM (split into program ROM
and video ROM which is directly accessible to the onboard video) and
about 5.8K of RAM split into program or video memory. The onboard video
generates a single 320x240 video mode in either 4, 8, 16 or 256 colours
from a full 24-bit RGB range with two scrollable background layers, up
to 512 16x16 sprites (with maxima of 96 per frame and 12 per scanline)
and a top-most text overlay that can use 8x8 or 16x16 glyphs in a 27x8
matrix. On-core DMA handles quickly transferring data from PROM/PRAM
into VRAM. Audio consists of two tone generators and two white noise
generators which can be mixed. Interrupts can fire on the vertical or
horizontal blanks, I/O lines (8 input ports, 16 bidirectional ports), or
two timers, plus a separate watchdog which can reset the IC.
<p>
<p>Winbond developed at least four chips in this line starting with the
W55V91 around 2000, then the W55V92 and W55V93 in 2004, and finally the
(wait for it) W55V94 in 2005. They were produced more or less
simultaneously through at least 2006 and differ primarily in amount of
available RAM and ROM, plus (starting with the V93) a CMOS camera
interface for integrating video input. This interface only supports
display and is mixed in at the video encoder level, meaning capture data
can be seen onscreen without CPU assistance but is consequently
inaccessible to reading or manipulation by programs.</p>

<p>How a complex scene might be generated appears in this sample
screenshot from the V93/V94 datasheets. Input from an attached CMOS
sensor has the lowest priority and is overlaid first by background zero
(the blue backdrop) and then background one (the yellow “stage”), which
is higher priority than both. Both figures standing on stage are
composite sprites which can be individually above or below background
one. Finally, the text layer has the highest priority, with 16x16 glyphs
used for “CMOS interface” and 8x8 glyphs used for the “Manual Mode” text
at the bottom. However, these two DTVs don’t seem to use many of these
features and primarily treat the onboard video as a framebuffer with
sprites.</p>

<p>Both units are Atari 2600 DTVs produced by Jakks Pacific and were
some of the earliest such hardware. Jakks Pacific was Jack Friedman’s
final toy and games company before his death after LJN (sold initially
to MCA and later Acclaim and subsequently dissolved in 1994) and THQ
(bankrupt in 2013), founded in 1995 and expanded rapidly through
acquisitions. Toymax was one of these buyouts which had produced an
early Activision-specific 2600 DTV unit in 2001 and seems to have been
what launched Jakks’ own line.</p>

<p>NOACs have a notorious history in Atari 2600 DTVs (the original Atari
Flashback being the exemplar), but the Toymax Activision DTV is actually
another 65816 Winbond-based unit because Jakks used the exact same
hardware and developer (DC Studios) for their own joystick-based VCS DTV
in 2002, as we’ll demonstrate. Jakks also recased and sold the same
Activision DTV under their own brand using a joystick instead of a
gamepad, while the paddle-based VCS DTV came out in 2004. As HDTVs and
more advanced consoles proliferated, Jakks eventually jettisoned their
DTV line in the mid-2010s, though they’re
<a href="https://www.jakks.com/categories/">still in business selling

<p>Jakks generally consolidated its DTV offerings under the TV Games and
Plug-it-in-and-Play TV Games brands, including several models with toy
and character tie-ins unrelated to classic video gaming. Despite being
the later of those models, we’re going to talk about the paddle Atari
DTV first because
<a href="https://pnp-info.angelfire.com/#cpus_table">there is
first-person recollection</a> that it was Winbond W55V9x-based. The
development period would make it most likely a W55V91, and none of these
toys have a need to use the more expensive V93/V94 because they don’t
have video input. From that information we’ll derive the joystick Atari
DTV’s architecture and by extension the “primordial” Toymax, though I
don’t personally have that unit here.</p>

<p>The exact formal name of this product is subject to some debate, but
it goes something like (deep breath) “Jakks Pacific Atari 2600
Plug-it-in-and-Play 13 TV Games Paddle.” It seems to have sold in decent
numbers as it’s not hard to track down (this unit was a few bucks on the
eBay), though the two-player version here is somewhat more uncommon. The
paddles really impressed me, particularly for ones intended purely as
toys. Each wheel has pretty good throw and spin feel and nice detents,
and the buttons are solid with a satisfying travel distance except for
RESET which is obnoxiously all but inaccessible. The plastic is
similarly thick and durable. Overall, I found the build quality
surprisingly high and a competent facsimile of my CX30s.</p>

<p>The reason we know the CPU/SoC in this unit is because of its
developer, Digital Eclipse. Digital Eclipse had a cottage industry
during the growing interest in emulation in the 1990s developing highly
precise emulations and recreations of older software and hardware. One
of their early specialties was Williams Electronics’ 6809-based arcade
games like Sinistar and Joust. In 1995 Dad had just bought an AT&amp;T
Globalyst PC from Computer City, a Pentium 75 that we were told came
with Windows 3.1 but actually came with the brand-spanking-new Windows
95. There was some consternation as a result because he primarily used
the PC for word processing with Ami Pro, though fortunately it worked
just fine (thanks, Raymond Chen!). I took advantage of this to buy the
Activision Commodore 64 15-Pack here (this is my original copy) which
was also out that year and also ran on Windows 95, but what I really
wanted it for was its legally cracked D64 versions of my favourite
titles like Portal, Park Patrol and Hacker. Unfortunately for Digital
Eclipse their own early emulator wasn’t <em>quite</em> as authentic as
<a href="/2023/05/refurb-weekend-commodore-128dcr.html">my Commodore
128DCR</a> sitting right next to the Pentium, but that was okay because
C64S wasn’t either, and their games loaded way faster than the 128 since
they didn’t emulate the disk drive and started from preloaded memory
images.</p>

<p>Plugging the main paddle in and turning it on, we get these copyright
messages, amusingly delivered in a modified Commodore 64 font (which is
itself a modification of the Atari 8-bit font). These two screens
immediately tell us it <em>can’t</em> be a standard NOAC. The text
display is fixed-width and C64 font glyphs are 8x8, which would limit
any NOAC-based hardware using them to 32 characters per line (i.e., 256
divided by 8), while these screens have several lines longer than that.
The TMS 9918A in the 99/4A and Tomy Tutor and many others <em>does</em>
have a 40-column mode at 256x192, but by compressing character glyphs to
6x8.</p>

<p>The main menu. You select games and options by rolling the primary
paddle and pressing the button. Only eleven of the titles are actually
VCS games; the other two are a recreation of Atari Pong and a visually
different but still entertaining take on arcade Warlords. This is a bit
of a skunk because that practically eliminates any incentive to play the
2600 Warlords also present, effectively cutting the “real” game count
down to twelve.</p>

The game’s formal credits screen is also accessible from the menu. It’s
always risky to count pixels on analogue grabs and its pixels are
slightly taller than they are wide, but let’s concentrate on the center
long line “Support Programming: George Phillips”. This is 36 characters
long and on this 640x480 grab roughly 512 pixels wide and 16 pixels
tall. That makes every 8x8 glyph roughly 14.2 by 16 pixels on this grab.
Since we know that the W55V9x series generates a 320x240 display, that
means all 30 rows of text occupy the entire screen vertically but for
each row the Winbond leaves roughly 18 pixels of horizontal gutter space
on the left and right. That would cover the TV-safe region on the sides
but a programmer would need to be mindful of the top and bottom borders
and not paint in them (or a CRT TV will cut those portions off). It
should also be obvious that all of this is being generated directly on
the SoC’s background layers because the character matrix is clearly
larger than 27x8.

<p>The source for the Winbond being used in this device was

<p>I don’t intend this to be a review, but looking at a couple games to
get an idea of its hardware features is instructive. Fortunately, unlike
a NOAC trying to act like a STIC (badly), the W55V9x is fully able to
draw an accurate 2600 TIA screen. Here is Breakout. The players and
missiles are easily represented with the W55V9x’s sprites, and the TIA
160x192 display and 128 colour NTSC palette are well within the
Winbond’s capabilities. As a practical matter it looks like Digital
Eclipse simply chose to double the horizontal pixels and vertically
centre the TIA display rows within the Winbond’s 240 line viewport,
which takes care of the TV-safe region. Sound at least in theory should
also be within the W55V9x’s tone generators’ range, both being
two-channel audio, though the sound effects in these games don’t sound
quite exact since the timbre differs. Still, it’s pretty close.</p>

<p>In each game, the menu button on the main paddle (not the side fire
button, which is the regular paddle button) brings up an array of
options you can modify. These vary from game to game. At the bottom is a
“virtual console” also drawn by Vavasour which you can use to flip the
VCS’s physical switches such as difficulty. You return to the main menu
by spinning the knob all the way to the left and hit fire.</p>

<p>The simulations are generally complete enough to even model things
like those black “comb” lines on the left from positioning the TIA
players at the beginning of a scan line (remember that 2600 games must
“race the beam” with the CPU emitting screen data every line, every
frame), here shown in Night Driver. With minor exceptions, audio
notwithstanding, I found the games in this DTV to be very consistent
with my real Darth Vader 2600.</p>

<p>The Pong game is probably the weakest of the set and seems mostly
thrown in as a bonus easy-to-implement paddle title. Adding some of the
variation games would have seemed a logical step but this is “just
Pong.” It’s still a competent knockoff of Pong Doubles, at least
compared to my Ultra Pong Doubles unit; it’s just not as interesting as
the other games and there are other Pong consoles
<a href="/search/label/pong">I like better</a>. Its primary draw is as a
better single player opponent than with Video Olympics, which is also
included, and does have variations.</p>

I did enjoy Warlords, though. I always liked it in the arcade and
although this conversion was consciously inaccurate, game play is fairly
on point compared to the real ROM running in MAME. Graphically the
screen had to be reformatted to prevent the arcade’s 256x240 framebuffer
from extending into the TV safe range on the top and bottom, requiring
scaling the display down to keep the same proportions and timing. I’d
say that was successful overall, though like I mentioned, its biggest
sin is that it renders the 2600 Warlords almost superfluous.
<p>
<p>Yeah, okay, you want me to crack it open now.</p>

My first impression is that there’s a lot of gunk on the board plus an
extended visit from the hot glue fairy. I can understand why many people
thought this was a NOAC device because the board superficially resembles
one, but the big difference is the crystal at Y1 (next to the blobtop at
U2) with a 27MHz value. This is the only supported operating frequency
for the W55V9x series, divided down by four to yield the 6.75MHz CPU
clock for the ’816, and is not a known master clock value for any NOAC I
could find.
<p>
<p>A bigger question is that the Winbond data sheet makes the SoC sound
like a single chip, but we have <em>two</em> blobtops here. The crystal
feeds U2, so the CPU core is probably there, but we can’t make too many
conclusions about U1 without digging the board out to trace the vias.
Some of the marked spots on the board are not populated and there is a
whole string of test points on one side.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the hot glue fairy worked her viscous magic within as

The joystick precedes the paddles by about two years. Really, Toymax
(and by extension DC Studios, who did the development and later went on
<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dc-studios-announces-the-return-of-the-commodore-64-in-an-all-new-direct-to-tv-d2tv-unit">to
work on the C64 DTV</a>) made it harder on themselves by starting off
with technologically advanced VCS games like the Activision series
first. These would have been very difficult to get right in simulation
due to their complex programming. Most contemporary reviews complained
about the conversion quality in both the Toymax Activision and DC
Studios VCS DTVs, and they might have been better served cutting their
teeth on the simpler games Digital Eclipse cloned with good success.
None of this is to take away anything from the quality of DE’s ports;
they merely benefitted further from less technically demanding games
that could be fully characterized more easily.
<p>
<p>The stick itself, while fatter and a little bottom heavy due to the
electronics in the base, actually feels a little flimsier and less
substantial than my real CX40. You can still “grab” it pretty well, but
I always preferred Wico sticks to these anyway.</p>

Main menu for the joystick VCS DTV and an example instruction screen
provided for each game (a nice touch). However, an immediately bad sign
is that games like Breakout, Pong and Circus were meant to be played
with <em>paddles</em>. The Pong here in fact Video Olympics, all three
of which were also on the paddle DTV, and does have proper variations.
<p>
Interestingly, the menu and background colour on this device extend
right out to the very edges of the display. There is no text there, but
there is colour and some lines. These could be sprite effects or the use
of a register not documented in the datasheet to widen the viewport.
<p>
<p>The text on the instruction screen is wide enough to demonstrate it
has the same basic resolution as the paddle DTV, and thus can’t be
generated as such by a standard NOAC. If you compare these grabs to
video captures of the Toymax Activision DTV, you’ll see
<a href="https://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/reviews/toymax/activision.html">it’s
the same</a> in nearly every respect except for the included games.</p>

Adventure felt really wrong. I never played it heavily on the real
system but even as a casual player this version just felt, um, off.
Other players opined that the dragons and game objects had different
properties, and Warren Robinette’s
<a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/atari-adventure/The_First_Easter_Egg">famous
easter egg</a> is apparently
<a href="https://forums.atariage.com/topic/15156-jakks-pacific-atari-10-in-1-game-system-review/">unobtainable</a>.
When you’ve lost Curt Vendel …
<p>
<p>Again, as a simulation it would have been exceptionally difficult to
track down all the behavioural edges in a game this densely packed, and
it shows. It would have been a big job for anybody. But that doesn’t
mean it gets a pass.</p>

The hard stuff: the screen and gameplay. It plays pretty well
<em>most</em> of the time. However, it does strangely lag sometimes when
you land a hit, and some players complained that the appearance didn’t
quite match the original. I wasn’t able to trigger the Warshaw initials
easter egg but I’m not a skillful player, so that doesn’t mean it can’t.
<p>
<p>On all of these titles, sound was largely regarded as “inspired by”
rather than “perfect cover band.” Most of the games didn’t sound much
like the VCS originals at all, whereas at least the paddle DTV sounds
were close, just not perfect.</p>

<p>Removing the four base screws allows the top stick to come off, but
to get to the top of the mainboard we’ll need to remove a second set of
screws and then pry it up. Take note of how the wires are packed for
reassembly because everything is crammed in tight.</p>

Here is the front (upside down in the unit) and back of the mainboard.
The back has a plate on it which I took off to look at the traces; I
left the buttons alone, but they just attach with little rubber pegs
that can be popped out with care.
<p>
We again see our U1 and U2 globtops along with the 27MHz crystal we saw
in the paddle DTV. This almost certainly has to be the same Winbond
65816 SoC, and because the Toymax DTV uses the same menu and interface,
it’s almost certainly the same hardware as well. The crystal again feeds
U2.
<p>
The audio line is the white wire at the top left (northwest) corner of
the board. We can trace it along L4 down to C1 to enter U2. The video
line is the red wire between sound and ground (ha ha). It goes through
L6 and past an unpopulated C6 to enter U1. U1 also has an interesting
“P/N” jumper at JP2 that is not bridged (the solder blob is on N). In
the W55V91 datasheet pin 28 selects PAL (high) or NTSC (low), so leaving
the circuit broken appears to be setting it to NTSC.
<p>
The button pads are bit harder to trace because they start on the back
and exit in the front under some of the gobs of glue, but appear to
enter U2. Similarly, the lines from the front control board (yellow,
blue, teal and orange wires) also track into U2, including what looks
like the reset line, which is one of the yellow wires.
<p>
A number of lines bridge between U1 and U2 but some cursory continuity
testing of the exposed vias didn’t connect them with anything else.
These are likely some sort of bus. The block diagram shows two halves
with DMA between them, but the division isn’t clean on these boards
because while U1 seems to have more of the video features, to match the
block diagram it should also have the audio PSG, which is apparently in
U2. U2, however, appears to have all of the CPU facilities and I/O.
Whatever split we’re seeing here doesn’t seem to match the
documentation.
<p>
<p>Ideally we would like this to be set up the same as the NOAC where
the ROMs are on one side and the full SoC is on the other, but if first
appearances are to be believed, this apparently divides into a video
chip and “everything else.”</p>

Reassembling is easiest if you do it upside down like you disassembled
it, or otherwise the stick insert and button will fall out. The buttons
all have little thin guides that they slot into.
<p>
The NOAC DTVs are cheap and nasty, but they’re surprisingly hackable if
you’re prepared to do some fiddling, and their contents can be
transplanted to bigger units. Unfortunately, assuming the ROMs on each
end (VROM in U1, PROM in U2) are all blobbed together in each die, it
doesn’t look like it’s possible to dump — let alone reprogram — the
Winbond 65C816 SoCs without decapping and destroying them to visually
inspect their contents. Maybe that was on purpose. But these devices at
least are so cheap and exist in such numbers that such a sacrifice seems
reasonable to yield useful insight into other such units. If you’ve done
this or want to partner on it, post in the comments.
<p>
<p>Either way, though, it turns out the 65816 was in a lot more devices
than just the obvious explicit ones. The Winbond W55V9x series is no
Super NES in a chip, but it’ll do until one comes along. Let’s hear it
for tiny 16-bit consoles.</p>

<p>It’s been a long while since I have felt really positive about most
of what I have been reading and seeing in AI. Not because I inherently
dislike AI, but because I feel like so many folks have been brainwashed
by the “scale is all you need” notion and “AGI in 2025” (or 2027 or
2029) nonsense, none of which seems remotely plausible to me as a
cognitive scientist.</p>
