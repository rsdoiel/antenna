## When “everything” becomes too much: the npm package chaos of 2024

date: 2024-01-07, from: OS News

Happy 2024, folks! Just when we thought we&#8217;d seen it all, an npm user named PatrickJS, aka gdi2290, threw us a curveball. He (along with a group of contributors) kicked off the year with a bang, launching a troll campaign that uploaded an npm package aptly named everything. This package, true to its name, depends on every other public npm package, creating millions of transitive dependencies. The everything package and its 3,000+ sub-packages have caused a Denial of Service (DOS) for anyone who installs it. We&#8217;re talking about storage space running out and system resource exhaustion. But that&#8217;s not all. The creator took their prank to the next level by setting up http://everything.npm.lol, showcasing the chaos they unleashed. They even included a meme from Skyrim, adding some humor (or mockery, depending on your perspective) to the situation. ↫ Feross Aboukhadijeh I know this is a bad thing, you shouldn&#8217;t do this, it harms a lot of people, etc., etc., but let&#8217;s be honest here &#8211; this is a hilarious prank that showcased a weakness in a rather playful way. Sure, there were real consequences, but it doesn&#8217;t seem like any of them caused any permanent damage, data loss, or compromised systems. What&#8217;s worse, it seems this isn&#8217;t even the first time stuff like this happened, so I find it baffling people can still do this. What are they doing over there?

## Hollywood Festivities Return as 'Barbie' Vies for Golden Globes

date: 2024-01-07, from: VOA News USA

BEVERLY HILLS, California — Margot Robbie, Oprah Winfrey and Leonardo DiCaprio will mingle with other top stars on Sunday at the Golden Globe awards, Hollywood's first big celebration since twin strikes shut down most of show business last year. 


The red carpet, champagne-fueled awards ceremony will honor the best of film and television selected by a new group of 300 entertainment journalists from around the world, part of reforms made after a diversity and ethics scandal among voters.  


"Barbie," the summer blockbuster starring Robbie as the iconic doll, leads all nominees with nine nominations. Historical drama "Oppenheimer," about the making of the atomic bomb, follows with eight nods. 




The Globes kick off Hollywood's annual awards season, which culminates with the Oscars on March 10, and will bring top stars together after six months of strikes by actors and writers in 2023. The ceremony will give celebrities the chance to shine a spotlight on their films and TV shows after months when promotion was prohibited.  


"I'm a little biased, but this is the best awards show and we're going to have fun," said comedian Jo Koy, who will host his first major awards show starting at 8 p.m. ET (0100 GMT on Monday). 


The ceremony will be broadcast live on U.S. TV network CBS and streamed simultaneously for subscribers to Paramount+ with Showtime. 


Acting nominees include Robbie and "Barbie" co-star Ryan Gosling, plus "Oppenheimer" stars Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. DiCaprio, Lily Gladstone and Robert De Niro, who starred in Martin Scorsese's "Killers of the Flower Moon," also are up for trophies.  


Winfrey is among the night's presenters. Pop superstar Taylor Swift also may join the A-list crowd as a nominee for "Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour," her concert film that is in the running in a new category for cinematic and box office achievement.  


In the television field, "Succession" is expected to win accolades for its final season about the high-stakes battle for control of a global media empire. It leads all nominees with nine nods, followed by restaurant dramedy "The Bear" with five. 


There are 27 first-time nominees for this year's Globes.  


Known as a boozy celebration more relaxed than the Oscars, the Globes nearly became extinct. A 2021 Los Angeles Times report revealed ethical lapses and a lack of diversity among the roughly 80 members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the group that previously voted on the Globes. The 2022 ceremony was scrapped while the organization made reforms. 


Last year, the Globes were sold to new owners and the association was disbanded. Eldridge Industries and Dick Clark Productions now operate the awards, with a voting body of 300 journalist members from 75 countries with 60% racial and ethnic diversity. 


The changes appear to have persuaded Hollywood's top talent to embrace the show and its new members. 


"They're trying to announce that they're new and improved," said Joyce Eng, senior editor at awards website Gold Derby. "I feel like people are more receptive to them."

## OF BOOKS AND BABIES

The above might well be a sculpture of Zeus cradling his son Dionysus. Or it might be me cradling my new novel. Grandiose? You bet I&#8217;m grandiose. But it&#8217;s the grandiosity of fear - a parent&#8217;s dread that the new arrival (only four weeks away now) won&#8217;t fulfil its expectations, won&#8217;t live up to its billing, won&#8217;t be a prodigy, won&#8217;t change the world.

## China Sanctions 5 US Defense Companies

date: 2024-01-07, from: VOA News USA

BEIJING  — China announced sanctions Sunday on five American defense-related companies in response to U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and U.S sanctions on Chinese companies and individuals.


The sanctions will freeze any property the companies have in China and prohibit organizations and individuals in China from doing business with them, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement posted online.


It was unclear what impact, if any, the sanctions would have on the companies, BAE Systems Land and Armaments, Alliant Techsystems Operations, AeroVironment, ViaSat and Data Link Solutions. Such sanctions are often mostly symbolic as American defense contractors generally don't sell to China.


The Foreign Ministry said the U.S. moves harmed China's sovereignty and security interests, undermined peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and violated the rights and interests of Chinese companies and individuals.


"The Chinese government remains unwavering in our resolve to safeguard national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity and protect the lawful rights and interests of Chinese companies and citizens," the ministry statement said.


The announcement was made less than a week ahead of a presidential election in Taiwan that is being contested in large part over how the government should manage its relationship with China, which claims the self-governing island as its territory and says it must come under its rule.


The Chinese Foreign Ministry did not specify which arms deal or which U.S. sanctions China was responding to, though spokesperson Wang Wenbin had warned three weeks ago that China would take countermeasures following the U.S. government's approval of a $300 million military package for Taiwan in December.


The deal includes equipment, training and equipment repair to maintain Taiwan's command, control and military communications capabilities.


The U.S. said the sale would support the modernization of Taiwan's armed forces and the maintenance of a credible defense. "The proposed sale will improve the recipient's capability to meet current and future threats by enhancing operational readiness," a news release from the Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency said.


Taiwan is a major flashpoint in U.S.-China relations that analysts worry could explode into military conflict between the two powers. China says that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan are interference in its domestic affairs.


The Chinese military regularly sends fighter planes and ships into and over the waters around Taiwan, in part to deter the island's government from declaring formal independence. An invasion doesn't appear imminent, but the constant military activity serves as a reminder that the threat is ever-present.


The U.S. switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979, but it is bound by its own laws to ensure that Taiwan has the ability to defend itself. America and its allies sail warships through the Taiwan Strait, a 160-kilometer-wide waterway that separates the island from China.

## California Legalizes Most Lowrider Cruising

date: 2024-01-07, from: VOA News USA

## Asian Restaurant in US Battles Racist Stereotype of Dog-Eating

date: 2024-01-07, from: VOA News USA

FRESNO, Calif. — David Rasavong's cultural pride is evident all throughout his restaurant.


It's on the wall of family portraits and where a stunning mural depicts his family's journey from Laos to California. It's on the menu filled with Lao and Thai dishes like the crispy coconut rice salad of Nam Khao and the stir-fried rice noodles of Pad See Ew.


And it's in the fact that Love & Thai in Fresno, California, restaurant is open at all. A baseless accusation grounded in a racist stereotype about Asian food using dog meat brought a six-month barrage of harassment so heated that Rasavong, 41, closed down its previous location over fears for his family's safety.


His earlier restaurant had itself only been open for seven months when a so-called animal welfare crusader in May implied on social media that a pitbull tied up at an unconnected home next door was going to be served on the menu.


A day after the initial commentary, vitriolic statements, voicemails and calls rained down. Rasavong's body still tenses up when recounting, in particular, a call from an elderly woman.


"She was so disgusted by me and yelling and screaming, and the only thing I can remember hearing her say at the end was 'Go back to the country you came from you dog-eating mother-effer,'" Rasavong recently told The Associated Press.


Within days, he closed that restaurant because it no longer felt safe between the harassment and people loitering in the parking lot outside of business hours.


The false accusation tapped into a longstanding slur against Asian cuisines and cultures that has persisted in the U.S. for over 150 years, dating back to the xenophobia that grew in the U.S. after Chinese immigrants started arriving in more visible numbers in the 1800s and other Asian communities followed. It's also one that Asian American communities are fighting against.




It may be astonishing to some that a claim rooted in a racist stereotype took down a family's restaurant three years after "Stop Asian Hate" became a rallying cry. But for many Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, it's something they've heard before as an insult or under the guise of a "joke," along with other negative reactions to the actual foods of their cultures. In December, a comedian received some backlash for dressing like a UPS delivery driver and walking into an Asian restaurant with caged puppies for a social media video.


There is hope though that more people will learn to tell truth from trope. Since the pandemic first fueled anti-Asian hostilities, AAPI communities themselves have tried to take control of the narrative that Asian food is "dirty," "weird" yet "exotic." Furthermore, the appetite to learn about food from the Asian diaspora has only grown across traditional and new media.


Still, there were moments where Rasavong felt like nobody, even media, was on his side. He said a few reporters approached him assuming the claims were true.


But he soon received tons of community support, and the closure ended up being a new beginning.


A shopping center property manager offered him the chance to take over a suite vacated by another restaurant. Nkundwe P. van Wort-Kasyanju, a graphic designer in the Netherlands, and Los Angeles-based interior designer Danny Gonzales proffered their services for free. Hana Luna Her, a local artist, painted the mural. By the Nov. 3 grand opening of the new space, Love & Thai definitely felt the love. The place was bustling all day, Rasavong said, and the city presented a proclamation.


Rasavong is holding onto the belief that he went through this whole saga for a reason.


"There's a journey that we're supposed to go on," said Rasavong, who declined to say if he'll pursue legal action. "Don't get me wrong. People need to realize this business is not easy ... But you know, we believe in what we're doing and so far so good."


In actuality, consuming dog meat is something that has happened in various parts of the world for centuries, where they weren't seen as domesticated family pets, said Robert Ku, author of Dubious Gastronomy: The Cultural Politics of Eating Asian in the USA. Greeks and Romans referenced it. The French also ate dog meat during World War II.


But when Chinese immigrants came to the U.S., it was linked to them as part of "the myths that the Chinese were these bizarre people who had bizarre diets," Ku said. "It was one of the attractions of actually going to Chinese restaurants back in the day because it came with 'danger.'"




As other Asian immigrant groups came, the stereotype spread to include them.


"This is a real just blurring of the Asian identity where it doesn't matter if you're Thai or Korean or Vietnamese or Cambodian. You're all the same," Ku said.


Along with the false allegation of eating dog meat, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders over the generations have often faced disgust and worse from others when they've brought their cultures' foods from home to public spaces like school or work.


They're taking steps to fight back, like in 2021, when San Francisco-Bay Area-based writers Diann Leo-Omine. Anthony Shu and Shirley Huey self-published Lunchbox Moments, a compilation of over two dozen personal essays and illustrations that raised $6,000 for charity.


The project became "a powerful thing for all of us," Leo-Omine said.


"We tried to show it's not always about being in relation to being American or being white or assimilated," she said. "You can have moments of joy, too...I hope that it opened people's minds a little bit more — or made them want to try new foods."


It's actually been a big year in publishing and food media for Asian cuisine. Publishers Weekly dedicated a feature in August entirely to Chinese and Taiwanese food after observing nine new cookbooks on the subjects were coming out this year. Several of the authors grew up outside of Asia. The titles range from Vegan Chinese Food, to Kung Food and A Very Chinese Cookbook from America's Test Kitchen. Also, children's book author Grace Lin released Chinese Menu, which relays folklore behind favorite Chinese American dishes. They all share personal anecdotes and readers often seem drawn to "personality-driven" cookbooks, said Carolyn Juris, features editor.


"It's not just about the recipes. It's about the stories behind them and I think people respond to that," Juris said.


Like any other culture, Asian cultures encompass many different regional cuisines and nuances. With the growing Asian diaspora, it's not strange that so many cookbooks can be mined and "publishers are savvy enough to know that there is a market for these books," Juris added.


Back at Love & Thai, Rasavong is busy filling online orders for a waiting third-party delivery driver. He is optimistic about keeping up business now that the initial hoopla around his restaurant renaissance has calmed down. Rasavong also hopes his situation will remind others to think before they speak.


"People say these jokes and they think it's just fun and just light-hearted," he said. "There are certain things that you shouldn't say that really do cross a line."

## Illegal Border Crossings Into US Drop After Mexico Boosts Enforcement

date: 2024-01-07, from: VOA News USA

EAGLE PASS, Texas — Daniel Bermudez's family had fled Venezuela and was headed to the U.S. to seek asylum when the freight train they were riding through Mexico was stopped by immigration officials.


His wife tried to explain that her family had permission to go to the U.S. Instead, they flew her to Mexico's southern border as part of a surge of enforcement actions that U.S. officials say have contributed to a sharp drop in illegal border crossings.


In addition to forcing migrants from trains, Mexico also resumed flying and busing them to the southern part of the country and started flying some home to Venezuela.


Even if temporary, the decrease in illegal crossings is welcome news for the White House. President Joe Biden's administration is locked in talks with Senate negotiators over restricting asylum and $110 billion in aid for Ukraine and Israel hangs in the balance.


Bermudez said his wife became separated from her family when she talked to authorities as he gathered his stepchild and their belongings. He wanted to run, but his wife said they shouldn't because they had followed procedure by making an appointment with U.S. immigration authorities.


"I told her, ‘Don't trust them. Let's go into the brush,'" Bermudez said, adding that other migrants had fled. He recalled her telling him, "Why are they sending us back if we have an appointment?"


Last week, Bermudez, his stepchild and two other relatives were waiting for her at a shelter in the Mexican border town of Piedras Negras as she took a bus back in hopes of still making the date.


Mexico's immigration agency sent at least 22 flights from its border region with the U.S. to southern cities during the last 10 days of December, according to Witness at the Border, an advocacy group that tracks flight data. Most were from Piedras Negras, which is across the border from Eagle Pass, Texas.


Mexico also ran two removal flights to Venezuela with 329 migrants. The stretch was punctuated by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Mexico City on December 28 to confront unprecedented crossings to the United States.




Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said a financial shortfall that had led the immigration agency to suspend deportations and other operations was resolved. He did not offer details.


Arrests for illegal crossings into the U.S. from Mexico fell to about 2,500 on Monday, down from more than 10,000 on several days in December, according to U.S. authorities. In the Border Patrol's busiest area, arrests totaled 13,800 during the seven-day period ending Friday, down 29% from 19,400 two weeks earlier, according to Tucson, Arizona, sector chief John Modlin.


The drop led U.S. Customs and Border Protection to reopen the port of entry in Lukeville, Arizona, on Thursday after a monthlong closure on the most direct route from Phoenix to its nearest beaches. The U.S. also restored operations at Eagle Pass and three other locations.


Merchants in Eagle Pass, a city of about 30,000 people, saw sales take "a major hit" while a bridge was closed to vehicle traffic so border agents could be reassigned to help process migrants, Maverick County Judge Ramsey English Cantu said.


"We survive pretty much from everything that comes from the Mexican side," he said.


Last month, CBP resumed freight crossings in Eagle Pass and El Paso, Texas, after a five-day shutdown that U.S. officials said was a response to as many as 1,000 migrants riding atop a single train through Mexico before trying to walk across the border.


In Piedras Negras on Thursday, Casa del Migrante housed about 200 migrants, down from as high as 1,500 recently.


Among them was Manuel Rodriguez, 40, who said his family will miss their appointment to seek asylum that was made through the U.S. government's CBP One app. He said the appointment was registered with his in-laws, who were deported to Venezuela after authorities boarded the bus they were riding.


"It was all under her name and she lost everything," Rodriguez said.


Proposals being discussed by the White House and Senate negotiators include a new expulsion authority that would deny rights to seek asylum if illegal border crossings reach a certain threshold. Any such authority would almost certainly depend on Mexico's willingness to take back non-Mexicans who enter the U.S illegally, something it does now on a limited scale.


Mexico's support was critical to defunct Trump-era policies that forced 70,000 asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico for hearings in U.S. immigration court and to deny rights to seek asylum during the COVID-19 pandemic.


Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute in Washington, D.C., cautioned against overstating Mexico's role in the recent drop in traffic. Panama reported that less than 25,000 migrants walked through the Darién jungle in December, about half of October's level and a sign that fewer people are leaving South America for the U.S. Migration usually drops in December amid holidays and cold weather.


"The U.S. is able to lean on Mexico for a short-term enforcement effect on migration at the border, but the long-term effects are not always clear," Selee said.

## US Coal Miners Unearth Mammoth Tusk Buried for Thousands of Years

date: 2024-01-07, from: VOA News USA

BISMARCK, ND — The first person to spot it was a shovel operator working the overnight shift, eyeing a glint of white as he scooped up a giant mound of dirt and dropped it into a dump truck.


Later, after the truck driver dumped the load, a dozer driver was ready to flatten the dirt but stopped for a closer look when he, too, spotted that bit of white.


Only then did the miners realize they had unearthed something special: a 2-meter-long mammoth tusk that had been buried for thousands of years.


"We were very fortunate, lucky to find what we found," said David Straley, an executive of North American Coal, which owns the mine.


The miners unearthed the tusk from an old streambed, about 12.1 meters deep, at the Freedom Mine near Beulah, North Dakota. The 18,210-hectare surface mine produces up to 14.5 million metric tons of lignite coal per year.


After spotting the tusk, the crews stopped digging in the area and called in experts, who estimated it to be 10,000 to 100,000 years old.


Jeff Person, a paleontologist with the North Dakota Geologic Survey, was among those to respond. He expressed surprise that the mammoth tusk hadn't suffered more damage, considering the massive equipment used at the site.


"It's miraculous that it came out pretty much unscathed," Person said.


A subsequent dig at the discovery site found more bones. Person described it as a "trickle of finds," totaling more than 20 bones, including a shoulder blade, ribs, a tooth and parts of hips, but it's likely to be the most complete mammoth found in North Dakota, where it's much more common to dig up an isolated mammoth bone, tooth or piece of a tusk.




"It's not a lot of bones compared to how many are in the skeleton, but it's enough that we know that this is all associated, and it's a lot more than we've ever found of one animal together, so that's really given us some significance," Person said.


Mammoths once roamed across parts of Africa, Asia, Europe and North America. Specimens have been found throughout the United States and Canada, said Paul Ullmann, a University of North Dakota vertebrate paleontologist.


The mine's discovery is fairly rare in North Dakota and the region, as many remains of animals alive during the last Ice Age were destroyed by glaciations and movements of ice sheets, Ullmann said.


Other areas have yielded more mammoth remains, such as bonebeds of skeletons in Texas and South Dakota. People even have found frozen carcasses in the permafrost of Canada and Siberia, he said.


Mammoths went extinct about 10,000 years ago in what is now North Dakota, according to the Geologic Survey. They were larger than elephants today and were covered in thick wool. Cave paintings dating back 13,000 years depict mammoths.


Ullmann calls mammoths "media superstars almost as much as dinosaurs," citing the Ice Age film franchise.


This ivory tusk, weighing more than 22.6 kilograms, is considered fragile. It has been wrapped in plastic as paleontologists try to control how fast it dehydrates. Too quickly, and the bone could break apart and be destroyed, Person said.


Other bones also have been wrapped in plastic and placed in drawers. The bones will remain in plastic for at least several months until the scientists can figure how to get the water out safely. The paleontologists will identify the mammoth species later, Person said.


The mining company plans to donate the bones to the state for educational purposes.


"Our goal is to give it to the kids," Straley said.


North Dakota has a landscape primed for bones and fossils, including dinosaurs. Perhaps the best-known fossil from the state is that of Dakota, a mummified duckbilled dinosaur with fossilized skin, Ullmann said.


The state's rich fossil record is largely due to the landscape's "low-elevation, lush, ecologically productive environments in the past," Ullmann said.


North Dakota's location adjacent to the Rocky Mountains puts it in the path of eroding sediments and rivers, which have buried animal remains for 80 million years or more, he said.


"It's been a perfect scenario that we have really productive environments with a lot of life, but we also had the perfect scenario, geologically, to bury the remains," Ullmann said.

## Trump Downplays Jan. 6 Capitol Siege, Calls Jailed Rioters 'Hostages'

date: 2024-01-07, from: VOA News USA

NEWTON, Iowa — Former President Donald Trump, campaigning in Iowa on Saturday, marked the third anniversary of the January 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol by casting the migrant surge on the southern border as the "real" insurrection.


Just over a week before the Republican nomination process begins with Iowa's kickoff caucuses, Trump did not explicitly acknowledge the date. But he continued to claim that countries have been emptying jails and mental institutions to fuel a record number of migrant crossings, even though there is no evidence that is the case.


"When you talk about insurrection, what they're doing, that's the real deal. That's the real deal. Not patriotically and peacefully — peacefully and patriotically," Trump said, quoting from his speech on January 6, before a violent mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol as part of a desperate bid to keep him in power after his 2020 election loss.


Trump's remarks in Newton in central Iowa came a day after Biden delivered a speech near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, where he cast Trump as a grave threat to democracy and called January 6 a day when "we nearly lost America — lost it all."


With a likely rematch of the 2020 election looming, both President Joe Biden and Trump have frequently invoked January 6 on the campaign trail. Trump, who is under federal indictment for his efforts to overturn his 2020 loss to Biden, has consistently downplayed or spread conspiracy theories about a riot in which his supporters — spurred by his lies about election fraud — tried to disrupt the certification of Biden's win.


Trump also continued to bemoan the treatment of those who have been jailed for participating in the riot, again labeling them "hostages." More than 1,230 people have been charged with federal crimes connected to the violence, including assaulting police officers and seditious conspiracy.


"They ought to release the J6 hostages. They've suffered enough," he said in Clinton, in the state's far east. "Release the J6 hostages, Joe. Release 'em, Joe. You can do it real easy, Joe," he said.




Trump was holding the commit-to-caucus events just over a week before voting will begin on January 15. He arrived at his last event nearly three-and-a-half hours late due to what he said was a mechanical issue with a rented plane.


After Trump spoke in Newton, he signed hats and other items people in the crowd passed to him, including a copy of a Playboy magazine that featured him on the cover.


One man in the crowd, Dick Green, was standing about 15 feet away, weeping after the former president autographed his white "Trump Country" hat and shook his hand.


"It'll never get sold. It will be in my family," Green said of the hat.


A caucus captain and a pastor in Brighton, Iowa, Green said he had prayed for four years to meet Trump.


"I'll never forget it," he said. "It's just the beginning of his next presidency."


Trump spent much of the day assailing Biden, casting him as incompetent and the real threat to democracy. But he also attacked fellow Republicans, including the late Sen. John McCain of Arizona, whose "no" vote derailed GOP efforts to repeal former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law.


"John McCain, for some reason, couldn't get his arm up that day," said Trump of McCain, who was shot down over Vietnam in 1967 and spent 5½ years as a prisoner of war. The injuries he suffered left him unable to lift his arms over his head for the rest of his life. His daughter, Meghan McCain, responded on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, calling Trump an expletive and her father an "American hero."


Earlier Saturday, Trump courted young conservative activists in Des Moines, speaking to members of Run GenZ, an organization that encourages young conservatives to run for office.


Trump's campaign is hoping to turn out thousands of supporters who have never caucused before as part of a show of force aimed at denying his rivals momentum and demonstrating his organizing prowess heading into the general election.


His chief rivals, former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, were also campaigning in the state as they battle for second place in hopes of emerging as the most viable alternative to Trump, who is leading by wide margins in early state and national polls.


Trump has used the trip to step up his attacks against Haley, who has been gaining ground. He again cast her Saturday as insufficiently conservative and a "globalist" beholden to Wall Street donors, and accused her of being disloyal for running against him.


"Nikki will sell you out just like she sold me out," he charged.


On Friday, Trump had highlighted several recent Haley statements that drew criticism, including her comment that voters in New Hampshire correct Iowa's mistakes ("You don't have to be corrected," he said.) and her failure to mention slavery when asked what had caused the Civil War.


"I don't know if it's going to have an impact, but you know like … slavery's sort of the obvious answer as opposed to her three paragraphs of bulls---," he told a crowd Friday.


In Newton, he said that he was fascinated by the "horrible" war, which he suggested he could have prevented.


"It's so fascinating," he said. "It's just different. I just find it… I'm so attracted to seeing it... So many mistakes were made. See that was something I think could have been negotiated, to be honest with you."


Haley's campaign has pointed to his escalating attention, including a new attack ad, as evidence Trump is worried about her momentum.


"God bless President Trump, he's been on a temper tantrum every day about me ... and everything he's saying is not true," Haley told a crowd Saturday in North Liberty, Iowa.

## US Defense Secretary Takes Responsibility for Secrecy About His Hospitalization

date: 2024-01-07, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement on Saturday he took "full responsibility" for secrecy surrounding an ongoing, weeklong hospitalization for a still unspecified medical condition. 


Austin, who is 70, was admitted on New Year's Day to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for what the Pentagon has said were "complications following a recent elective medical procedure," a fact the Defense Department kept under wraps for five days. 


Austin sits just below President Joe Biden at the top of the chain of command of the U.S. military and his duties require him being available at a moment's notice to respond to any manner of national security crisis. 


It remains unclear the extent to which his duties were delegated to his deputy, Kathleen Hicks, or whether Austin was involved in any key decisions during his absence. 


The Pentagon has yet to detail why Austin is being treated, whether he lost consciousness over the past week, or offer details on when he might be released. 


"I recognize I could have done a better job ensuring the public was appropriately informed. I commit to doing better," Austin said in a written statement. "But this is important to say: this was my medical procedure, and I take full responsibility for my decisions about disclosure." 


A spokesperson said on Saturday that Austin resumed his full duties on Friday evening but remained in the hospital. 


The Pentagon Press Association, in a letter to Pentagon officials on Friday evening, criticized the Defense Department's secrecy, saying Austin was a public figure who had no claim to medical privacy in such a situation. 


It also noted that even U.S. presidents disclose when they must delegate duties due to medical procedures. 


"At a time when there are growing threats to U.S. military service members in the Middle East and the U.S. is playing key national security roles in the wars in Israel and Ukraine, it is particularly critical for the American public to be informed about the health status and decision-making ability of its top defense leader," wrote the association, whose board of directors includes Reuters correspondent Phil Stewart.


Military Reporters and Editors (MRE), a non-profit organization for journalists covering the U.S. military, said the decision to release the information on a Friday evening, when online readership is typically lower, "is keeping in the worst traditions of obfuscation and opacity." 


"This is a violation of the intent and spirit of the Pentagon's own Principles of Information, and it fails to meet the standards of public disclosure for senior government officials unable to exercise their duties," MRE wrote in a statement.

## Random WordPress idea

date: 2024-01-06, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><i>Caveat: This very likely already exists. </i></p>
<p>Random idea for my friends at Automattic. How about a theme for a WordPress site that's good for technical subjects. </p>
<p>It should have good default styles for code. Handle screen shot images gracefully. Basically a way of using WordPress for documenting the kinds of things we write up on GitHub because their editor is designed to work well for technical stuff. </p>
<p>Just thinking out loud. A good test case would be the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS 2.0 spec</a>, which doesn't look too great after years of no-updates (more than 20 years) and browser slippage? </p>
<p>It started life as a Manila site, transitioned to WordPress, and now I believe it's a static site. At one time it looked good in WordPress. It could totally use the kind of treatment <a href="https://doc.searls.com/">Doc's blog</a> got, but obviously it's serving a different purpose. </p>

## Blinken Visits Middle East as Risk of Broader Conflict Grows

date: 2024-01-06, from: VOA News USA

washington — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Jordan on Sunday, where he met with Jordan’s King Abdullah II and Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi. Blinken also visited a World Food Program warehouse where trucks are loaded with aid for Gaza.


Jordan is the latest stop on Blinken’s tour of the region, which has been rocked by the Israel-Hamas fighting. Jordan and other Arab countries have demanded an immediate cease-fire since the conflict erupted in October, but Israel has resisted the call.




Turkey is prepared to use its influence with critical countries in the Middle East to deescalate and prevent the Gaza conflict from spreading, Blinken told reporters late Saturday, after he held talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a strong critic of Israel’s military actions in Gaza.


Blinken held meetings earlier in the day with Erdogan in Istanbul, and then in Crete with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. He embarked on a Middle East diplomacy tour this week seeking to calm the situation in Gaza and soothe regional frictions.


In a separate meeting with Blinken, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan called for "an immediate cease-fire" in Gaza and for the uninterrupted flow of humanitarian aid. Fidan also advocated for the immediate start of negotiations for a two-state solution, according to Turkish diplomatic sources.




The United States has urged a lasting peace and security for both Israelis and Palestinians. This involves achieving Palestinian political rights — notably the establishment of a Palestinian state with security assurances for Israel.


In Crete, Blinken thanked Mitsotakis for the country’s continued support for the delivery of life-saving humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza.


State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Blinken expressed appreciation for Greece's commitment to the freedom of navigation in the Red Sea.


This is particularly crucial, as Yemeni Houthis have been attacking vessels in the sea in solidarity with Hamas.


On Saturday, Lebanon's Iranian-backed Hezbollah group launched dozens of rockets into northern Israel. Israel responded with airstrikes on Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon.


"One of the areas of real concern is the border between Israel and Lebanon, and we want to do everything possible to make sure that we don't see escalation there," Blinken said Saturday.


He told reporters that Israel is "clearly not interested" in an escalation and emphasized, "It's not in Lebanon's interest to see any escalation."


Blinken’s fourth trip to the Middle East comes amid intense diplomatic efforts to facilitate the delivery of the humanitarian aid into the war-ravaged Gaza Strip and increasing international pressure on Israel to reduce civilian casualties among Palestinians.


Additionally, he will make the rounds in Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Israel, the West Bank and Egypt for meetings with foreign counterparts and other officials.


This comes at a time when the risk of a broader regional conflict is surging, despite collective efforts of Western and regional powers to confine the Israel-Hamas war to the Gaza Strip.


Israel began its military campaign to wipe out Hamas after Hamas fighters crossed into southern Israel on October 7. Israel said about 1,200 people were killed and about 240 captives taken in the terror attack.


Gaza health officials say more than 22,000 Palestinians, a large percentage of them women and children, have been confirmed killed in Israel's military offensive in the Gaza Strip.


The United States has stated its opposition to forcibly removing Palestinians from Gaza. The U.S. is also working on a postwar road map for the Palestinian territories.


"Gaza cannot, once again, serve as a launching pad for terrorist attacks against Israel," State Department spokesperson Miller told VOA earlier this week.


"What we ultimately want to see is Gaza and the West Bank reunited under Palestinian leadership," and "certainly there's no role for Hamas in that."


On Thursday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant outlined the country's plans for the next stage of its operations in Gaza. The new approach involves a more targeted strategy in northern Gaza and a continued pursuit of Hamas leaders in the south.


Gallant said in a statement that after the war, Gaza would no longer be under Hamas control. While Israel would retain operational freedom, there would not be any Israeli civilians present in the Gaza Strip.




Regional stability 


The State Department said the United States remains "incredibly concerned" about the risk of the conflict spreading into other fronts, after the killing Tuesday of senior Hamas official Saleh al-Arouri in Beirut.


The Israeli army said it was on high alert for attacks by the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. This follows a drone strike in Beirut that killed al-Arouri, who was closely associated with Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah.


In a televised speech, Nasrallah said there would be a "response and punishment," but he did not clearly declare that his forces would escalate attacks against Israel.


The U.S. has sent a "very direct message to Hezbollah" and other entities in the region that "now is not the time to think of escalating further," according to the State Department.


The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, or UNIFIL, has also voiced deep concern over the potential for escalation, while urging all parties to exercise restraint.


Earlier this week, Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the strike that killed al-Arouri, calling it a crime deliberately aimed at dragging Lebanon into a new phase of confrontations.


Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran, whose militant allies in Syria, Iraq and Yemen have also been carrying out longer-range attacks against Israel.


Humanitarian aid


The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, has warned that Gaza is becoming a public health disaster and that the recent mass displacement across southern Gaza is fueling disease outbreaks.


About 400,000 cases of infectious diseases have been reported since October 7, with about 180,000 people suffering from upper respiratory infections. More than 136,000 cases of diarrhea have been reported, half among children younger than 5, according to OCHA.


Hostage release


Meanwhile, intense diplomatic efforts to retrieve the remaining hostages held in Gaza by Hamas militants continue. There are believed to be 129 people held by Hamas and other militants in Gaza.


Last week, Egypt proposed a plan to end the military conflict involving a cease-fire, a phased hostage release, and the formation of a Palestinian government of experts to administer the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.


Details of the plan were reportedly worked out with Qatar and presented to Israel, Hamas, the United States and European governments. But the head of Hamas' political bureau, Ismail Haniyeh, stated Tuesday that the hostages will be released only on Hamas' terms.


Some material for this report was provided by Reuters and The Associated Press.

## What Biden needs to tell us

date: 2024-01-06, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>Sometimes social revolutions emerge from ordinary ideas. In the 17th and 18th centuries, thinkers like William Petty, David Hume and Adam Smith popularized a concept called &#8220;division of labor.&#8221; It&#8217;s a simple notion. If I specialize in doing what I&#8217;m good at, and you specialize in what you&#8217;re good at, and we exchange what we&#8217;ve each made, then we&#8217;ll both be more productive and better off than if we tried to be self-sufficient.</p>

## Pentagon Keeps Austin's Hospitalization Under Wraps for Days

date: 2024-01-06, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has been hospitalized since Monday for an unspecified medical matter, the Pentagon said late Friday, without detailing why he was being treated or why it kept his hospital stay secret all week. 


Austin, who is 70, sits just below President Joe Biden at the top of the chain of command of the U.S. military, and his duties require him being available at a moment's notice to respond to any manner of national security crises.


The Pentagon did not say whether Austin ever lost consciousness before or after he was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Jan. 1, or the extent to which his duties were assumed by his deputy, Kathleen Hicks.


Those duties include being ready and available to respond to an incoming nuclear attack.


The Pentagon said Austin suffered "complications following a recent elective medical procedure," but declined to say what that procedure was or what complications he suffered.


"He is recovering well and is expecting to resume his full duties today," Air Force Major General Patrick Ryder, the top Pentagon spokesperson, said in a statement Friday.


Just a day earlier, Ryder held a televised news briefing that conveyed the sense of business as usual at the Pentagon, offering Austin's condolences to ally Japan following its New Year's Day earthquake, for example.


But the past week has been anything but normal for the Pentagon, with U.S. troops in the Middle East wrestling with the regional fallout from the unfolding Israel-Hamas war and carrying out a U.S. retaliatory strike in Baghdad on Thursday.


The Pentagon Press Association, in a letter to Pentagon officials, criticized the Defense Department's secrecy, saying that Austin was a public figure who had no claim to medical privacy in such a situation.


"At a time when there are growing threats to U.S. military service members in the Middle East and the U.S. is playing key national security roles in the wars in Israel and Ukraine, it is particularly critical for the American public to be informed about the health status and decision-making ability of its top defense leader," it wrote.


Reuters correspondent Phil Stewart is a member of the association's board of directors.


The Pentagon Press Association letter noted that even U.S. presidents disclose when they must delegate duties due to medical procedures.


The way the Defense Department handled Austin's hospitalization stands in contrast to how the State Department dealt with then-Secretary of State Colin Powell's prostate surgery on Dec. 15, 2003.


The State Department spokesperson at that time issued a statement in the morning making public that Powell, a retired four-star general and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was in surgery at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and would remain there for several days before returning home.


It also said Powell would be on a reduced schedule while he recovered from the operation. The State Department's spokesperson at the time, Richard Boucher, then offered details on Powell's surgery in his daily briefing.


Boucher, contacted by Reuters on Friday, said the key question regarding public disclosure was whether Austin was under anesthesia or was incapacitated.


"Was there any moment in the process where he could not function as secretary of defense?" he asked. "If you are up and walking around and have your information and you have your aides in the next room and you can make split-second decisions . . . then there is probably not a public necessity to disclose.


"The only necessity is if you are going to be conked out," he added.


The Pentagon has not yet answered that question.

## NY Seeks $370M in Penalties in Trump's Civil Fraud Trial

date: 2024-01-06, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — New York state lawyers increased their request for penalties to over $370 million Friday in Donald Trump's civil business fraud trial. He retorted: "They should pay me."


The exchange came as lawyers for both sides filed papers highlighting their takeaways from the trial in court filings ahead of closing arguments, set for next Thursday. Trump is expected to attend, although plans could change.


It will be the final chance for state and defense lawyers to make their cases. The civil lawsuit, which accuses the leading Republican presidential hopeful of deceiving banks and insurers by vastly inflating his net worth, is consequential for him even while he fights four criminal cases in various courts.


The New York civil case could end up barring him from doing business in the state where he built his real estate empire. On top of that, state Attorney General Letitia James is seeking the $370 million penalty, plus interest — up from a pretrial figure of $250 million, nudged to over $300 million during the proceedings.


The state says the new sum reflects windfalls from wrongdoing, chiefly $199 million in profits from property sales and $169 million in savings on interest rates, as calculated by an investment banking expert hired by James' office.


Trump bristled at the proposed penalty in an all-caps post on his Truth Social platform, insisting anew that "there was no victim, no default, no damages."


He complained that the attorney general was seeking $370 million and instead "should pay me," asserting that businesses are fleeing New York.


According to the state Labor Department, the number of private sector jobs in New York increased 1% in the year that ended this past November, compared with 1.6% nationally.


James' office argued in a filing Friday that Trump, his company and executives clearly intended to defraud people.




"The myriad deceptive schemes they employed to inflate asset values and conceal facts were so outrageous that they belie innocent explanation," state lawyer Kevin Wallace wrote.


The state alleges Trump and his company ginned up exorbitant values for golf courses, hotels and more, including Trump's former home in his namesake tower in New York and his current home at the Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida. The numbers were listed on personal financial statements that netted him attractive rates on loans and insurance, leaving him money to invest in other projects and even his 2016 presidential campaign, James' office says.


The defendants, including Trump's sons Donald Jr. and Eric, deny any wrongdoing. The former president has painted the case as a political maneuver by James, Judge Arthur Engoron and other Democrats, saying they're abusing the legal system to try to cut off his chances of winning back the White House this year.


He asserts that his financial statements came in billions of dollars low, and that any overestimations — such as valuing his Trump Tower penthouse at nearly three times its actual size — were mere mistakes and made no difference in the overall picture of his fortune.


He also says the documents are essentially legally bulletproof because they said the numbers weren't audited, among other caveats. Recipients understood them as simply starting points for their own analyses, the defense says.


None of Trump's lenders testified that they wouldn't have made the loans or would have charged more interest if his financial statements had shown different numbers, and 10-plus weeks of testimony produced "no factual evidence from any witness that the gains were ill-gotten," attorneys Michael Madaio and Christopher Kise wrote in a filing Friday. Nor, they said, was there proof that insurers were ripped off.


Separately, defense lawyers argued that claims against Executive Vice Presidents Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. should be dismissed because they never had "anything more than a peripheral knowledge or involvement in the creation, preparation, or use of" their father's financial statements.


The sons relied on the work of other Trump Organization executives and an outside accounting firm that prepared those documents, attorneys Clifford Robert and Michael Farina said, echoing the scions' own testimony.


Their father also took the stand, disputing the allegations, decrying the case as political and criticizing the judge and the attorney general. James' office argued in its filing Friday that Trump was "not a credible witness."


"He was evasive, gave irrelevant speeches and was incapable of answering questions in a direct and credible manner," Wallace wrote.


The verdict is up to the judge because James brought the case under a state law that doesn't allow for a jury. Engoron has said he hopes to decide by the end of this month.


He will weigh claims of conspiracy, insurance fraud and falsifying business records. But he ruled before trial on the lawsuit's top claim, finding that Trump and other defendants engaged in fraud for years. With that ruling, the judge ordered that a receiver take control of some of the ex-president's properties, but an appeals court has frozen that order for now.


During the trial, Engoron fined Trump a total of $15,000 after finding that he violated a gag order that barred all trial participants from commenting publicly on the judge's staff. The order was imposed after Trump maligned the judge's principal law clerk.


Trump's lawyers are appealing the gag order.

## US Defense Secretary Austin Hospitalized for Complications After Minor Procedure

date: 2024-01-06, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON  — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has been hospitalized since Monday, due to complications following a minor elective medical procedure, Air Force Major General Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said Friday. It was the department's first acknowledgement that Austin had been admitted — five days earlier — to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.


Ryder said Friday that it's not clear when Austin will be released from the hospital but that the secretary is "recovering well and is expecting to resume his full duties today."


The Pentagon's failure to disclose Austin's hospitalization is counter to normal practice with other senior U.S. and Cabinet officials, including the president. The Pentagon Press Association, which represents media members who cover the Defense Department, sent a letter of protest to Ryder and Chris Meagher, who is the assistant defense secretary for public affairs.


"The fact that he has been at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for four days and the Pentagon is only now alerting the public late on a Friday evening is an outrage," the PPA said in its letter. "At a time when there are growing threats to U.S. military service members in the Middle East and the U.S. is playing key national security roles in the wars in Israel and Ukraine, it is particularly critical for the American public to be informed about the health status and decision-making ability of its top defense leader."


Ryder said that this has been an "evolving situation," and due to privacy and medical issues the department did not make Austin's absence public. He declined to provide any other details about Austin's medical procedure or health.


In a statement, Ryder said that at all times, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks "was prepared to act for and exercise the powers of the Secretary, if required."


Austin, 70, spent 41 years in the military, retiring as a four-star Army general in 2016.
