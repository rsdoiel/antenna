Extreme heat killed 2,325 people in America last year, the highest

<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2822854?guestAccessKey=53b50a89-0945-4117-a662-5e1e1484ebce&utm_content=tfl&utm_term=082624&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9rHrnH5FSWmy3AnmFy2zRnLKl-7agWd1F-SyZVUj_M9mV5NSQhd7VwyRlqB5_KYaPzCVZz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a>
published in the journal <em><em>American Medical Association</em></em>.
The data shows 21,518 heat-related deaths since 1999, with the number of
deaths remaining steady until 2016, when they began to rise noticeably.
Last year the number surpassed 2,000 for the first time in the recorded
time period. The age-adjusted rate of heat deaths per capita has also
been rising. It stood at 0.17 deaths per 100,000 people in 2015, and
reached 0.63 last year. “As temperatures continue to rise because of
climate change, the recent increasing trend is likely to continue,” the
researchers wrote. “Local authorities in high-risk areas should consider
investing in the expansion of access to hydration centers and public
cooling centers or other buildings with air conditioning.”

yesterday it will impose 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs starting October 1
in an effort to prevent cheap cars from flooding the market and
threatening Canadian auto manufacturing. New levies might also be
applied to other clean technologies, including batteries and solar
panels, after a 30-day consultation period. “Actors like China have
chosen to give themselves an unfair advantage in the global marketplace,
compromising the security of our critical industries and displacing
dedicated Canadian autos and metal workers,” said Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau. Last year Canada imported $1.6 billion worth of Chinese EVs, up
from just $74 million in 2022,

“Ottawa is trying to position Canada as a critical part of the global EV

against China.” Canada’s move puts it in alignment with the U.S. and the
European Union, which have both taken steps to hike tariffs on Chinese
EVs.

<li>Guterres sounds the alarm about sea level rise

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres warned yesterday at
the Pacific Island Forum Leaders Meeting in Tonga that the “surging seas
are coming for us all.” The comments come as two new reports – from the
<a href="https://wmo.int/publication-series/state-of-climate-south-west-pacific-2023?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9rHrnH5FSWmy3AnmFy2zRnLKl-7agWd1F-SyZVUj_M9mV5NSQhd7VwyRlqB5_KYaPzCVZz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">World

– underscore the growing threat of rising seas for coastal communities
and low-lying island nations. Oceans have risen by approximately 9
inches since 1880, and the rate of sea level rise has more than doubled
over the past 10 years, driven by melting land ice and the expansion of
sea water as it warms.
</p>
<p>
The Pacific islands are uniquely exposed, the reports say, but the
problem is global. Under a scenario in which temperatures rise by 3
degrees Celsius, by 2050 New York City, Boston, New Orleans, and
Atlantic City are all expected to see sea levels rise between 9 and 16
inches. “Across the world, around a billion people live in coastal areas
threatened by our swelling ocean,” Guterres said. “Yet even though some
sea level rise is inevitable, its scale, pace, and impact are not. That
depends on our decisions.”

You may have heard the phrase “be cool, stay in school” before. That’s a
bit hard when it’s this hot out though. More than 10,000 schools
nationwide lack air conditioning, according to the Center for Climate
Integrity. Installing ACs is costly — but so is heat’s impact on student
learning. Also on the program: We’ll look at the growing push to erase

week of US weather includes heat wave, tropical storm, landslide, flash
flood and snow</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>FALCON HEIGHTS, Minn. — It’s been a wild week of weather in many
parts of the United States, from heat waves to snowstorms to flash
floods.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at some of the weather events:</p>
<p>Midwest sizzles under heat wave</p>
<p>Millions of people in the Midwest have been enduring dangerous heat
and humidity.</p>
<p>An emergency medicine physician treating Minnesota State Fair-goers
for heat illnesses saw firefighters cut rings off two people’s swollen
fingers Monday in hot weather that combined with humidity made it feel
well over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 degrees Celsius).</p>
<p>Soaring late summer temperatures also prompted some Midwestern
schools to let out early or cancel sports practices. The National
Weather Service issued heat warnings or advisories across Minnesota,
Iowa, South Dakota, Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Wisconsin and
Oklahoma. Several cities including Chicago opened cooling centers.</p>
<p>Forecasters said Tuesday also will be scorching hot for areas of the
Midwest before the heat wave shifts to the south and east.</p>
<p>West Coast mountains get early snowstorm</p>
<p>An unusually cold storm on the mountain peaks along the West Coast
late last week brought a hint of winter in August. The system dropped
out of the Gulf of Alaska, down through the Pacific Northwest and into
California. Mount Rainier, southeast of Seattle, got a high-elevation
dusting, as did central Oregon’s Mt. Bachelor resort.</p>
<p>Mount Shasta, the Cascade Range volcano that rises to 14,163 feet
(4,317 meters) above far northern California, wore a white blanket after
the storm clouds passed. The mountain’s Helen Lake, which sits at 10,400
feet (3,170 meters) received about half a foot of snow (15 centimeters),
and there were greater amounts at higher elevations, according to the
U.S. Forest Service’s Shasta Ranger Station.</p>
<p>Tropical storm dumps heavy rain on Hawaii</p>
<p>Three tropical cyclones swirled over the Pacific Ocean on Tuesday,
including Tropical Storm Hone, which brought heavy rain to Hawaii;
Hurricane Gilma, which was weakening; and Tropical Storm Hector, which
was churning westward, far off the southern tip of the Baja California
peninsula of Mexico.</p>
<p>The biggest impacts from Tropical Storm Hone (pronounced hoe-NEH)
were rainfall and flash floods that resulted in road closures, downed
power lines and damaged trees in some areas of the Big Island, said
William Ahue, a forecaster at the Central Pacific Hurricane Center in
Honolulu. No injuries or major damage had been reported, authorities
said.</p>
<p>Deadly Alaska landslide crashes into homes</p>
<p>A landslide that cut a path down a steep, thickly forested hillside
crashed into several homes in Ketchikan, Alaska, in the latest such
disaster to strike the mountainous region. Sunday’s slide killed one
person and injured three others and prompted the mandatory evacuation of
nearby homes in the city, a popular cruise ship stop along the famed
Inside Passage in the southeastern Alaska panhandle.</p>
<p>The slide area remained unstable Monday, and authorities said that
state and local geologists were arriving to assess the area for
potential secondary slides. Last November, six people — including a
family of five — were killed when a landslide destroyed two homes in
Wrangell, north of Ketchikan.</p>
<p>Flash flood hits Grand Canyon National Park</p>
<p>The body of an Arizona woman who disappeared in Grand Canyon National
Park after a flash flood was recovered Sunday, park rangers said. The
body of Chenoa Nickerson, 33, was discovered by a group rafting down the
Colorado River through the Grand Canyon, the park said in a
statement.</p>
<p>Nickerson was hiking along Havasu Creek about a half-mile (800
meters) from where it meets up with the Colorado River when the flash
flood struck. Nickerson’s husband was among the more than 100 people
safely evacuated.</p>
<p>The flood trapped several hikers in the area above and below Beaver
Falls, one of a series of usually blue-green waterfalls that draw
tourists from around the world to the Havasupai Tribe’s reservation. The
area is prone to flooding that turns its iconic waterfalls chocolate
brown.</p>

of Chinese electric vehicles and a 25% tariff on imported steel and

<h2 id="how-de-googled-is-lineage-os">How de-Googled is Lineage OS?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>On the whole, I’m satisfied that Lineage OS, as I use it, is
preventing nearly all of Google’s data collection. I don’t install or
use any Google services, I don’t enable A-GPS, I don’t use Chromium or
the built-in browser. I could eliminate more arcane aspects of data
collection – like the Internet connectivity check – if I wanted to take
the trouble. I don’t think that taking reasonable precautions to avoid
becoming part of Google’s data collection economy makes me a
tinfoil-hatter. Nevertheless, I would probably use GrapheneOS instead,
if I had devices that supported it. Ironically, if I wanted to use
GrapheneOS, I’d have to buy Google-branded mobile devices, which is an
irony that really stings. ↫ Kevin Boone The existence of Android
versions like LineageOS, GrapheneOS, /e/OS, and similar, other
de-Googled mobile operating systems is absolutely vital. The market is
dominated by Google Android and iOS, and since full alternatives that
aren’t Android or iOS are effectively impossible, de-Googled Android is
the best we’re going to get. Regulators must ensure that banks,
government ID applications, popular messaging platforms, and similarly
crucial applications work 100% reliably on de-Googled Android, and do
not require Google Play Services in any way, shape, or form. In The
Netherlands, there are basically three banks that control the market,
and there’s really just one messaging application that rules the country
– WhatsApp – and their use is effectively required to participate in
society. Consequently, these applications and platforms should be
accessible by as many people as possible, and that definitely includes
de-Googled Android devices. Being alive should not be taxed by Apple or
Google.</p>

id="judge-pauses-program-to-offer-legal-status-to-spouses-of-us-citizens">Judge
pauses program to offer legal status to spouses of US citizens</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>McALLEN, Texas — A federal judge in Texas on Monday paused a Biden
administration policy that would give spouses of U.S. citizens legal
status without having to first leave the country, dealing at least a
temporary setback to one of the biggest presidential actions to ease a
path to citizenship in years.</p>
<p>The administrative stay issued by U.S. District Judge J. Campbell
Barker comes just days after 16 states, led by Republican attorneys
general, challenged the program that could benefit an estimated 500,000
immigrants in the country, plus about 50,000 of their children.</p>
<p>One of the states leading the challenge is Texas, which in the
lawsuit claimed the state has had to pay tens of millions of dollars
annually from health care to law enforcement because of immigrants
living in the state without legal status.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden announced the program in June. The court order,
which lasts for two weeks but could be extended, comes one week after
the Department of Homeland Security began accepting applications.</p>
<p>“The claims are substantial and warrant closer consideration than the
court has been able to afford to date,” Barker wrote.</p>
<p>Barker was appointed by former President Donald Trump in 2019 as a
judge in Tyler, Texas, which lies in the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, a favored venue for advocates pushing conservative
arguments.</p>
<p>The judge laid out a timetable that could produce a decision shortly
before the presidential election Nov. 5 or before a newly elected
president takes office in January. Barker gave both sides until Oct. 10
to file briefs in the case.</p>
<p>The policy offers spouses of U.S. citizens without legal status, who
meet certain criteria, a path to citizenship by applying for a green
card and staying in the U.S. while undergoing the process.
Traditionally, the process could include a yearslong wait outside of the
U.S., causing what advocates equate to “family separation.”</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately return an
email seeking comment on the order.</p>
<p>Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton cheered the order.</p>
<p>“This is just the first step. We are going to keep fighting for
Texas, our country, and the rule of law,” Paxton posted on the social
media platform X.</p>
<p>Several families were notified of the receipt of their applications,
according to attorneys advocating for eligible families who filed a
motion to intervene earlier Monday.</p>
<p>“Texas should not be able to decide the fate of hundreds of thousands
of U.S. citizens and their immigrant spouses without confronting their
reality,” Karen Tumlin, the founder and director of Justice Action
Center, said during the press conference before the order was
issued.</p>
<p>The coalition of states accused the administration of bypassing
Congress for “blatant political purposes.”</p>
<p>The program has been particularly contentious in an election year
where immigration is one of the biggest issues, with many Republicans
attacking the policy and contending it is essentially a form of amnesty
for people who broke the law.</p>
<p>To be eligible for the program, immigrants must have lived
continuously in the U.S. for at least 10 years, not pose a security
threat or have a disqualifying criminal history and have been married to
a citizen by June 17 — the day before the program was announced.</p>
<p>They must pay a $580 fee to apply and fill out a lengthy application,
including an explanation of why they deserve humanitarian parole and a
long list of supporting documents proving how long they have been in the
country.</p>
<p>If approved, applicants have three years to seek permanent residency.
During that period, they can get work authorization.</p>
<p>Before this program, it was complicated for people who were in the
U.S. illegally to get a green card after marrying an American citizen.
They can be required to return to their home country — often for years —
and they always face the risk they may not be allowed back in.</p>

private who fled to North Korea will plead guilty to desertion</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — An Army private who fled to North Korea just over a year
ago will plead guilty to desertion and four other charges and take
responsibility for his conduct, his lawyer said Monday.</p>
<p>Travis King’s attorney, Franklin D. Rosenblatt, told The Associated
Press that King intends to admit guilt to a total of five military
offenses, including desertion and assaulting an officer. Nine other
offenses, including possession of sexual images of a child, will be
withdrawn and dismissed under the terms of the deal.</p>
<p>King will be given an opportunity at a Sept. 20 hearing at Fort
Bliss, Texas, to discuss his actions and explain what he did.</p>
<p>“He wants to take responsibility for the things that he did,”
Rosenblatt said.</p>
<p>In a separate statement, he added, “Travis is grateful to his friends
and family who have supported him, and to all outside his circle who did
not pre-judge his case based on the initial allegations.”</p>
<p>He declined to comment on a possible sentence that his client might
face. Desertion is a serious charge and can result in imprisonment.</p>
<p>The AP reported last month that the two sides were in plea talks.</p>
<p>King bolted across the heavily fortified border from South Korea in
July 2023, and became the first American detained in North Korea in
nearly five years.</p>
<p>His run into North Korea came soon after he was released from a South
Korean prison where he had served nearly two months on assault
charges.</p>
<p>About a week after his release from the prison, military officers
took him to the airport so he could return to Fort Bliss to face
disciplinary action. He was escorted as far as customs, but instead of
getting on the plane, he joined a civilian tour of the Korean border
village of Panmunjom. He then ran across the border, which is lined with
guards and often crowded with tourists.</p>
<p>He was detained by North Korea, but after about two months, Pyongyang
abruptly announced that it would expel him. On Sept. 28, he was flown to
back to Texas, and has been in custody there.</p>
<p>The U.S. military in October filed a series of charges against King
under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, including desertion, as well
as kicking and punching other officers, unlawfully possessing alcohol,
making a false statement and possessing a video of a child engaged in
sexual activity. Those allegations date back to July 10, the same day he
was released from the prison.</p>

Cemetery honoring the 13 servicemembers killed during the U.S. exit,
then later in Detroit blamed Harris, the vice president, and President
Joe Biden for what he termed a “catastrophic” withdrawal.</p>
<p>“Caused by Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, the humiliation in Afghanistan
set off the collapse of American credibility and respect all over the
world,” Trump said in an address to the National Guard Association of
the United States.</p>
<p>It was the latest attempt by Trump and his campaign to raise doubts
about Harris’ fitness to serve as commander-in-chief as the Nov. 5
election draws near and comes after Harris last week proclaimed herself
ready to lead the nation’s armed forces.</p>
<p>The U.S. troop pullout and evacuation of U.S. and allied officials,
citizens and Afghans at risk of Taliban retribution saw crowds of
desperate Afghans trying to enter Kabul airport and men clinging to
aircraft as they taxied down runways in August 2021.</p>
<p>An Islamic State suicide bomber killed 13 U.S. servicemembers and
more than 150 Afghans outside an airport gate.</p>
<p>Harris’ campaign said the fault lay with Trump’s tenure as
president.</p>
<p>“The Biden-Harris administration inherited a mess from Donald Trump,”
said Ammar Moussa, a Harris spokesperson. “Trump wants America to forget
that he had four years to get out of Afghanistan but failed to do
it.”</p>
<p>The Biden administration was following a withdrawal commitment and
timeline that the Trump administration had negotiated with the Taliban
in 2020.</p>
<p>A review released by the U.S. State Department in 2023 found fault
with both the Trump and Biden administrations in the run-up to the
withdrawal.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Trump and his running mate, Senator JD Vance, also
have sought to turn Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz’s
decades of service into a political vulnerability. Former military
service is often a key selling point for candidates in U.S. political
campaigns.</p>
<p>The Republicans have accused Walz of exaggerating his rank in the
Army National Guard, where he served for 24 years. Walz has described
himself as a retired command sergeant major, one of the highest
noncommissioned officer positions in the Army. While he achieved that
rank, he did not meet the requirements to retire with that title.</p>
<p>The Harris campaign deleted a reference this month to Walz’s rank as
a “command sergeant major” on its website. The campaign also now says
Walz “misspoke” in 2018 during his gubernatorial campaign in Minnesota
when he referred to “weapons of war, that I carried in war.” Walz was
never deployed to a war zone.</p>
<p>Trump, 78, never served in the military. Though he was of draft age
during the Vietnam War, he received four student deferments and a
health-related one after he received a diagnosis for bone spurs in his
feet.</p>
<p>Vance served in the Marine Corps for four years as a combat
correspondent and was deployed to Iraq for roughly seven months. His
position mainly involved writing reports of military activity for public
dissemination and at times interacting with the media.</p>
<p>Harris has not served in the military.</p>
<p>Harris told CNN in 2021 that she was the last person in the room with
Biden when he decided to pull U.S. forces from Afghanistan and end
America’s longest war. She also said that she was comfortable with
Biden’s decision, but it remains unclear what role she played in the
discussion.</p>
<p>Both Biden and Harris released statements marking the anniversary on
Monday.</p>
<p>“These 13 devoted patriots represent the best of America, putting our
beloved nation and their fellow Americans above themselves and deploying
into danger to keep their fellow citizens safe,” Harris said.</p>
<p>Asked Monday why Biden and Harris weren’t marking the anniversary of
the Abbey Gate attack as Trump did at Arlington National Cemetery, White
House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters that Trump
had been personally invited by the family members and he called it one
way to honor the fallen.</p>
<p>“Another way is to continue to work,” Kirby said. “Maybe not with a
lot of fanfare, maybe not with a lot of public attention, maybe not with
TV cameras, but to work with might and main every single day to make
sure that the families of the fallen and of those who were injured and
wounded, not just at Abbey Gate, but over the course of the 20-some odd
years that we were in Afghanistan, have the support that they need.”</p>
<p>Also Monday, House Speaker Mike Johnson announced that Congress will
posthumously honor the 13 service members by presenting their families
with the Congressional Gold Medal next month. It’s the highest civilian
award that Congress can bestow.</p>

opens for man charged with killing 10 people at Colorado
supermarket</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>denver — Jury selection began Monday in the long-delayed trial of a
man charged with murdering 10 people at a Colorado supermarket in 2021,
a case in which the suspect was ruled mentally unfit to face prosecution
before pleading not guilty by reason of insanity. </p>
<p>The outcome hinges on whether the defense can convince jurors that
Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, 25, was so mentally ill at the time of the mass
shooting that he failed to comprehend the difference between right and
wrong and thus should not be held legally responsible for the
killings. </p>
<p>The basic facts of the case are not in dispute. Alissa stormed a King
Soopers grocery store in Boulder, about 28 miles (45 km) northwest of
Denver, on March 22, 2021, armed with a legally purchased Ruger AR-556
pistol, which resembles an AR-15-style rifle. </p>
<p>Police say he killed two people in the store’s parking lot before
shooting eight others to death inside the supermarket. Among those
killed was a police officer responding to the scene. </p>
<p>The shooting spree ended when a police officer shot Alissa in the
leg, leading the gunman, wearing only his underwear, to surrender. He
has remained in custody since the day of the shooting. </p>
<p>Alissa is charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder, in addition
to dozens of counts of attempted murder, assault and weapons offenses
stemming from the incident. </p>
<p>A conviction would carry an automatic sentence of life in prison
without parole. There is no death penalty in Colorado. </p>
<p>The trial officially got under way on Monday morning with the judge
and attorneys for both sides beginning the process of choosing jurors to
hear the case, a court spokesperson said.  </p>
<p>Jury selection is expected to wrap up by week’s end, with opening
statements possible as early as Friday, or on Tuesday following the U.S.
Labor Day holiday.  </p>
<p>The case against Alissa stalled after he underwent a court-ordered
psychiatric evaluation and was diagnosed with schizophrenia in late
2021. Boulder District Judge Ingrid Bakke, relying on the conclusions of
state psychologists, then deemed him incompetent to stand trial. </p>
<p>In November 2023, Bakke found that the defendant’s mental condition
had improved sufficiently under psychiatric treatment to rule him
restored to competency, allowing the prosecution to move forward. </p>
<p>Competence is a legal determination that weighs whether criminal
defendants understand the charges against them and can meaningfully
assist in their own defense. An insanity plea relates instead to the
defendant’s mental status at the time of the alleged crime. </p>
<p>Grim details of the killings emerged during his plea hearing last
year, when a Boulder homicide detective testified that Alissa shot one
man in the back, then pursued the victim as he tried to crawl away and
shot him again, killing him. The detective also testified the suspect
shot and wounded a woman, then fired multiple additional rounds at her
as she curled up in a fetal position, killing her. </p>
<p>All the victims struck by gunfire died of their wounds, authorities
said. </p>
<p>A precise motive for the killings has not been suggested by
prosecutors, though according to a psychologist who treated the gunman
at a state mental hospital, Alissa had said he wanted to “commit suicide
by cop.”</p>

id="social-platform-x-edits-ai-chatbot-after-election-officials-warn-that-it-spreads-misinformation">Social
platform X edits AI chatbot after election officials warn that it
spreads misinformation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>chicago — The social media platform X has made a change to its
AIchatbot after five secretaries of state warned it was spreading
election misinformation.</p>
<p>Top election officials from Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico,
Pennsylvania and Washington sent a letter this month to Elon Musk
complaining that the platform’s AI chatbot, Grok, produced false
information about state ballot deadlines shortly after President Joe
Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race.</p>
<p>The secretaries of state requested that the chatbot instead direct
users who ask election-related questions to CanIVote.org, a voting
information website run by the National Association of Secretaries of
State.</p>
<p>Before listing responses to election-related questions, the chatbot
now says, “For accurate and up-to-date information about the 2024 U.S.
Elections, please visit Vote.gov.”</p>
<p>Both websites are “trustworthy resources that can connect voters with
their local election officials,” the five secretaries of state said in a
shared statement.</p>
<p>“We appreciate X’s action to improve their platform and hope they
continue to make improvements that will ensure their users have access
to accurate information from trusted sources in this critical election
year,” they said.</p>
<p>Grok is available only to subscribers of the premium versions of X.
But the five secretaries of state who signed the letter said election
misinformation from Grok has been shared across multiple social media
platforms, reaching millions of people. Grok continued to repeat the
false information for 10 days before it was corrected, the secretaries
said. The platform did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>The change promoting a link to an official voting website does not
seem to address Grok’s ability to create misleading AI-generated images
related to elections. People have been using the tool to flood the
platform with fake images of candidates, including Vice President Kamala
Harris and former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Grok debuted last year for X premium and premium plus subscribers and
was touted by Musk as a “rebellious” AI chatbot that will answer “spicy
questions that are rejected by most other AI systems.”</p>
<p>Social media platforms have faced mounting scrutiny for their role in
spreading misinformation, including about elections. The letter also
warned that inaccuracies are to be expected for AI products, especially
chatbots such as Grok that are based on large language models.</p>
<p>Since Musk bought Twitter in 2022 and renamed it to X, watchdog
groups have raised concerns over a surge in hate speech and
misinformation being amplified on the platform, as well as cuts to the
staff that had been moderating content.</p>
<p>Experts say the moves represent a regression from progress made by
social media platforms attempting to better combat political
disinformation after the 2016 U.S. presidential contest and could
precipitate a worsening misinformation landscape ahead of this year’s
November elections.</p>

<p>If you are looking to upgrade your TV and want a long-lasting option,
you may consider getting a Samsung AI TV powered by Tizen OS. The reason
is that Samsung announced plans to offer seven years of Tizen OS
upgrades for some of its Smart TVs. ↫ Sagar Naresh Bhavsar at Neowin
Since buying a dumb TV is no longer possible, you might as well get the
one with the longest possible support lifecycle. This new policy covers
Samsung TVs from 2024 onward, as well as a few modls from 2023. There’s
no word on if the ads that I’m assuming are part of Samsung’s smart TVs
will also receive seven years of updates. Or, you know, get a good
Android TV box and never plug your actual TV into your network to begin

Programma 101: at the origins of the personal computer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>Due to its limited RAM of 1,920 bits, the Programma 101 was mostly a
machine conceived to make arithmetic calculations – sums, subtractions,
divisions, multiplications, square roots -, yet, like modern computers,
it could also perform logical operations, conditional and unconditional
jumps, and print the data stored in a register, all through a
custom-made alphanumeric programming language. This was, in the early
’60s, what set computers apart from calculators, indeed. Overall, in
today’s terms, Programma 101 can be considered a sort of “transitional
fossil” between desktop calculators and personal computers. ↫ Riccardo
Bianchini Olivetti sure is a name that carries an exceptional amount of
weight in the retrocomputing world, as classic Olivetti computers, even
standard Olivetti PCs, tend to be highly desirable. A Programma 101 in
amazing condition is currently for sale on eBay for a massive €20000,
and while there’s quite a few relatively cheap ’80s and ’90s Olivetti
PCs for sale, a sizable number of them are far more desirable and carry
massive premiums for their unique design. It’s sad how many once great
and influential computer makers have been relegated to the dustbin of
history, outcompeted, acquired, or run into the ground. Some of these
once great brands live on as mere badges on electronic junk, and
Olivetti, too, was not spared this fate. In fact, what is generally
considered the worst PDA ever made, the Olivetti daVinci, was a generic
product that just had an Olivetti logo slapped onto it. I have one
in-box, and intend to one day write about it, because its awfulness
needs to be shared with the world.</p>

id="special-counsel-asks-court-to-revive-charges-against-trump-in-documents-case">Special
counsel asks court to revive charges against Trump in documents
case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Special Counsel Jack Smith on Monday asked a
federal appeals court to revive the criminal case accusing Donald Trump
of retaining classified documents, after a lower court dismissed the
indictment in July, according to a court filing.</p>
<p>In their brief, Smith and his team of attorneys urged the
Atlanta-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit to overturn the
July 15 ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon in which she
concluded that Smith was unlawfully appointed and did not have the legal
authority to bring the case.</p>
<p>“Congress has bestowed on the Attorney General, like the heads of
many Executive Departments, broad authority to structure the agency he
leads to carry out the responsibilities imposed on him by law,” they
wrote.</p>
<p>“The district court’s contrary view conflicts with an otherwise
unbroken course of decisions, including by the Supreme Court, that the
Attorney General has such authority, and it is at odds with widespread
and longstanding appointment practices in the Department of Justice and
across the government.”</p>
<p>The Justice Department had previously said it planned to appeal the
ruling.</p>
<p>In Monday’s brief, Smith’s office also asked the appellate court to
schedule oral arguments.</p>
<p>Cannon, who was appointed to the bench by Trump, found that Attorney
General Merrick Garland’s decision to appoint Smith in 2022 violated the
U.S. Constitution. She also found that his budget, which is funded
through an indefinite appropriation, was unlawful.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers had previously challenged the legal authority for
Smith’s appointment, arguing that Smith’s office was not created by
Congress and the special counsel was not confirmed by the Senate.</p>
<p>Trump’s campaign said on Monday that the court should reject Smith’s
request and that other cases facing the former president should be
dismissed.</p>
<p>“Not only should the dismissal of the Lawless Indictment in Florida
be affirmed but be immediately joined by a dismissal of ALL the Witch
Hunts. The Democrat Justice Department coordinated ALL of these
Political Attacks, which are an Election Interference conspiracy against
Comrade Kamala’s Political Opponent, President Trump. Let us come
together to END all Weaponization of our Justice System,” Trump campaign
spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement.</p>
<p>Cannon’s ruling has faced staunch criticism, with many attorneys
saying it flies in the face of prior court decisions which all upheld
the legality of the rules that the Justice Department has relied on for
years in appointing special counsels.</p>
<p>“The Attorney General validly appointed the Special Counsel, who is
also properly funded,” Smith’s office wrote, adding that Cannon had
“deviated from binding Supreme Court precedent” and also “misconstrued
the statutes that authorized the Special Counsel’s appointment.”</p>
<p>Cannon’s decision to dismiss the case marked a legal victory for
Trump and came not long after the Supreme Court ruled that he had broad
criminal immunity from prosecution for official actions he took during
his time in office.</p>
<p>That Supreme Court decision has led to major delays in Smith’s second
criminal case against Trump, in which Trump is facing charges over his
efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.</p>
<p>Smith faces a Friday deadline to tell the judge overseeing the
election subversion case how he wishes to proceed in light of the
Supreme Court’s ruling.</p>
<p>Trump, who is running in the 2024 presidential election against Vice
President Kamala Harris, was convicted in May on New York state charges
involving hush money paid to an adult film star to avert a sex scandal
before the 2016 election.</p>
<p>His sentencing has been postponed following the Supreme Court’s
ruling on presidential immunity.</p>
<p>In the documents case, Trump was indicted on charges that he
willfully retained sensitive national security documents at his
Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after leaving office in 2021 and obstructed
government efforts to retrieve the material.</p>

cyberattack leaves Seattle airport facing major internet outages</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>seattle — An apparent cyberattack disrupted internet, phones, email
and other systems at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport for a third
day on Monday as Port of Seattle officials worked to investigate the
outages and restore full service.</p>
<p>“We’re working around the clock to get necessary systems back online
and to mitigate impacts to our passengers,” the airport’s aviation
managing director Lance Lyttle said in a press conference Sunday.</p>
<p>Lyttle said the airport is investigating with the help of outside
experts and is working closely with federal partners, including the
Transportation Security Administration and Customs and Border
Protection. Officials have not released details about the full scope of
the outage, but Lyttle said it was not affecting TSA’s ability to screen
passengers.</p>
<p>Some airlines, including Delta and Alaska, reported no service
interruptions from the outage. Both airlines use Sea-Tac as a hub.
Still, the outage did affect the Port of Seattle’s baggage sorting
system, prompting airlines to warn passengers to avoid checking bags if
possible to avoid potential delays.</p>
<p>The airport also warned travelers to allow extra time at the airport
and to use airline mobile applications to get boarding passes and bag
tags when possible.</p>
<p>Still, many travelers faced security lines that were longer than
normal and long waits at baggage claims and checking. Terminal screens
were also out throughout the airport, making it difficult for some to
determine their assigned gate.</p>
<p>“Port teams continue to make progress on returning systems to normal
operations, but there is not an estimated time for return,” the airport
wrote on Facebook on Sunday.</p>

Landowners Are By Far the Most Likely to Speak Out Against Clean

<p>date: 2024-08-26, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Attending a public hearing is the most important civic duty that nobody
actually does. (Well, not nobody — we’ll get into that.) But despite
attendance at public hearings being one of the most effective ways to
<a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/how-make-effective-public-comment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>directly
shape</u></a> one’s community, the average American probably isn’t
going. And heaven forbid you ask them to <em><em>speak</em></em>.
</p>
<p>
Heatmap’s latest
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/change-polling-concern-belief-republicans-vs-democrats" target="_blank">poll</a>
looked into, among other things, the actions someone would take if they
had concerns about a hypothetical clean energy project in their area.
What we learned is that Americans are more willing to <em><em>join a
lawsuit</em></em> (41%) than they are to talk at a public hearing (30%).
But there <em><em>is </em></em>a demographic that is bolder than the
rest of us glossophobes — people who owned 50 or more acres of land were
nearly one-and-a-half times as likely (43%) to speak up in such a
scenario. Overall, these large landowners were also more likely to say
they’d attend a public hearing about a clean energy project (71%) than
the general population (60%).
</p>
<p>
Community opposition is one of the leading causes of delays and
cancellations of renewable projects, with about one-third of wind and
solar siting applications in the last five years
<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/23022024/community-opposition-and-grid-challenges-slow-pace-of-renewable-efforts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>killed
by local pushback</u></a>. It’s also true that Republicans are more
likely to live in rural areas with renewable energy development, meaning
“conservatives’ opposition could prove more decisive to the future of
wind and solar than liberals’ support,” <em><em>The Washington
Post</em></em>
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2023/renewable-energy-land-use-wind-solar/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wrote
last year</u></a>. (Heatmap’s polling backs that up: 70% of the large
landowners we surveyed said they plan to vote for Donald Trump, compared
to 17% who said they intend to vote for Kamala Harris.)
</p>
<p>
Clean-energy advocates who work with rural partners, including large
landowners, told me they weren’t surprised to hear of the group’s high
levels of in-person engagement. “Obviously, it takes land to build wind
and solar, and a lot of that land is in rural America,” Jane Kleeb, the
founder and director of
<a href="https://boldalliance.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Bold
Alliance</u></a>, an environmental advocacy organization based out of
Nebraska that helps landowners navigate new infrastructure projects,
told me.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the biggest concern Heatmap encountered among
large landowners was that potential clean-energy projects could “take up
farmland” (70%), followed by worries that they’d “harm wildlife or local
nature/environmental sites” (58%; this is also the highest concern among
the general population, cited by 54% of all respondents).
</p>
<p>
Kleeb said she often encounters these anxieties when working with
partners in rural states. “When we’re talking with a community that for
decades has supported land being used to grow ethanol, which is also an
energy source — solar will take much less land <em><em>and</em></em> not
use water, which is a depleting resource in the Midwest and all across
the country,” she pointed out. (To be clear, Bold Alliance does support
ethanol.) As for environmental concerns, “wind and solar have way less
impact than fossil fuels on wildlife, period,” Kleeb said. “There’s no
comparison. It’s not even a close call.”
</p>
<p>
Another worry large landowners had that stood out from the general
population was that nearby land might be developed “by non-local
companies” (57% of large landowners vs. 37% of the general population).
“What’s not been happening well is that some clean-energy companies will
come into a community, and they won’t disclose where the projects are
going,” Kleeb said, adding that “community after community that we’re
engaging with wants to know that from the beginning, and they want to be
engaged in the discussions about where a project may or may not be
better suited to be placed.”
</p>
<p>
While Heatmap specifically looked at who would be the most likely to
speak out at a public hearing if they had <em><em>concerns
</em></em>about a clean-energy project in their area, Kyle Unruh, the
Idaho and Montana policy manager for Renewable Northwest, which works
with regional partners to create a cleaner grid, said he’s seen that
landowners will also “advocate for development on either their own land
— as a means of making feasible the continued ownership of a small farm
— or on behalf of a fellow landowner who should be entitled to their own
property rights and decisions about what happens on their private land.”
</p>
<p>
At the same time, Unruh has seen landowners testify that they believe
development on a nearby property could hurt their property values — a
concern raised by 45% of the large landowners who responded to Heatmap’s
survey — though he stressed that the claim that renewable energy
development decreases nearby property values “is
<a href="https://cleanpower.org/wp-content/uploads/gateway/2023/08/Solar-and-Property-Values-Fact-Sheet_0823.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>not
borne out</u></a> by
<a href="https://windexchange.energy.gov/projects/property-values" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
research</u></a>.” He cited this worry as another reason large
landowners evidently show up and speak out at public hearings more than
their suburban and urban neighbors. “Landowners tend to have an elevated
personal interest in whether energy development takes place, given this
development has the real potential to increase the value of their land
or the perceived effect of reducing the value or desirability of their
land,” he told me.
</p>
<p>
On the flip side, when Heatmap presented landowners with reasons why
they might <em><em>allow</em></em> renewable projects to be developed on
their land, people living on six or more acres were more likely to pick
“none of the above” (44%) in Heatmap’s polling than tax benefits (29%),
diversifying their income (28%), or starting an agrivoltaics venture
with solar generation and agriculture co-located on the same property
(20%), among other options. Of potential upsides“having a long-term
source of income” (35%) had the plurality, and “environmental benefits”
(31%) also held high appeal.
</p>
<p>
Clean-energy developers should be making a concerted effort to reach out
to large landowners from the start, but not just because they’re one of
the more vocal contingents at the local town hall. More often than not,
the energy transition will take place in literal backyards, and many
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/clean-energy-brownfield" target="_self"><u>opportunities</u></a>
for
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/swiss-re-natural-catastrophe-insurance#:~:text=Ohio%20has%20approved%20the%20Oak%20Run%20Solar%20Project%2C%20a%206%2C000%2Dacre%20solar%20farm%20in%20Madison%20County%20that%20will%20also%20graze%201%2C000%20sheep%20and%20grow%20crops.%20The%20farm%20will%20be%20the%20nation%E2%80%99s%20largest%20%E2%80%9Cagrivoltaics%E2%80%9D%20project." target="_self"><u>collaboration</u></a>
or partnership are lost when misinformation, conspiracies, or sneaky
development tactics lead instead.
</p>
<p>
“The climate movement, in general over the past decade, has missed the
boat here,” Kleeb of Bold Alliance told me. “There’s a major opportunity
to engage with the rural folks who will be shouldering the
responsibility of making sure that wind and solar are being built.”
</p>

This week’s weather forecast is like the Uno reverse card: Texas might
finally get a break from triple-digit temperatures, but the summer heat
is making its way back into the Northeast.
</p>
<h3>
After some taste of fall, summer returns to the north
</h3>
<p>
Those west of the Appalachians might have already started to feel a
shift in the air this weekend. After a week of below-average
temperatures and fall-like weather, <strong>heat maps for the Northeast
have gone back to looking very red.</strong> Temperatures could run 5 to
8 degrees Fahrenheit above average this week, Paul Pastelok, senior
meteorologist at AccuWeather, told me. <strong>“Highs will be the low to
mid 80s, nights in the upper 50s to lower 60s,”</strong> he said.
</p>
<p>
Philadelphia, which has already started to get warmer, might see even
higher temperatures, with some days later in the week hitting the low
90s. But for those in the state hoping to make the most of the heat by
turning it into a beach vacation, I am sorry to say this week will
likely be cloudy from beginning to end.
</p>
<p>
New England will also see the return of some warmth this week, but it’ll
be “slower and less impressive” than other nearby states, according to
Pastelok. Temperatures there will be closer to average, and will very
soon cool back down.

This summer hasn’t been fun for Texas. The unrelenting heat — more
intense there than in any other state — has shattered multiple
temperature records, increased wildfire activity, and contributed to
severe drought. Just last week, when most of the country got a taste of
cooler days ahead, the Texas energy grid
<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/texas-heat-wave-deadly-record-breaking-drought-b2600257.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>broke</u></a>
its demand record. While it’s still too soon to call off the season of
scorching temperatures, the new week brings some good news.
</p>
<p>
<strong>A strong cold front will bring temperatures down below average
across northern Texas later this week.</strong> Some precipitation in
South Texas could pull readings a few degrees lower still, Pastelok told
me, even though humidity is expected to remain high. Central Texas has
already started to get some relief, finally dropping out of the triple
digits this past weekend.
</p>
<h3>
Heat to intensify in the West
</h3>
<p>
<strong>Those in the Midwest will have to bear through an increase in
temperatures this week.</strong> The Great Plains, the Mississippi
Valley, the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes can all expect temperatures
in the high 80s and mid 90s, Pastelok told me. <strong>The heat won’t
last long, though.</strong> Starting Thursday, a cold front will start
moving through the region, and temperatures are expected to drop well
below average across the Plains and the Midwest for at least a few days.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Back to School:</strong> This quick but intense heat wave is
making its way across the Midwest right in time for back to school
season. Chicago Public Schools went back into session today with a
series of
<a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/weather/chicago-public-schools-to-begin-classes-amid-heat-wave/3531626/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>heat
adaptations</u></a> in place — athletic games have been canceled until
Wednesday and outdoor practices were moved indoors. While in Chicago all
classrooms are equipped with air conditioning, that is not true across
all of the region. According to
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2024/school-temperatures-heat-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>The
Washington Post</em></em></u></a>, as heat waves become more constant in
the North, almost 14,000 public schools that did not need AC back in
1970 need it today.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>In California, the week will be hot and wet.</strong> After a
series of storms pass through the state earlier this week, temperatures
will go back to rising. “The Central Valleys of California by late next
week will be well above average, along with the Desert Southwest,”
Pastelok told me. Cities such as Sacramento, Modesto, and Fresno, can
see temperatures above 100 degrees.
</p>
<h3>
Fall will be toasty
</h3>
<p>
According to the National Weather Service’s forecast, <strong>the entire
country will experience above average fall temperatures this
year.</strong> Seriously, I mean the <em><em>entire</em></em> country.
The hardest hit states will be New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Utah, and
then over on the top of the Northeast, from Maine to New York.
</p>
<p>
According to AccuWeather
<a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-forecasts/fall-forecast-warm-autumn-to-fuel-second-summer-across-most-of-the-us/1672230" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>forecasts</u></a>,
for many, fall will feel more like a “second summer” than a new season.
In fact, only two states — Washington and Oregon — will see a quick
transition into fall. The rest of the country is, well, doomed.
</p>
<p>
Not only will fall be hotter, it will also be dryer, raising concerns
over increased wildfire risk across California, parts of the Great Lakes
and the Northeast. Severe weather, such as tropical storms and
hurricanes, will also
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/kamala-harris-climate-dnc-speech#:~:text=2.%20Hurricane%20forecasters%20warn%20of%20%E2%80%98supercharged%20September%E2%80%99" target="_blank">define
the season</a>. AccuWeather has predicted six to 10 storms to hit the
country from this week through the end of September alone.
</p>
<p>
For snow lovers such as myself, it seems like flakes might not make an
appearance until November, and only in some of the coldest spots in the
northern Plains, Rockies, and Upper Midwest.

is bringing annoying Windows 11 Start menu ads to Windows 10</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Microsoft introduced a so-called “Account Manager”
for Windows 11 that appears on the screen when you click your profile
picture on the Start menu. Instead of just showing you buttons for
logging out, locking your device or switching profiles, it displays
Microsoft 365 ads. All the actually useful buttons are now hidden behind
a three-dot submenu (apparently, my 43-inch display does not have enough
space to accommodate them). Now, the “Account Manager” is coming to
Windows 10 users. ↫ Taras Buria at Neowin Yes, this is a really small ad
int he grand scheme of things, but the mere concept of my operating
system showing me all kinds of ads and upsells, as both Windows and
macOS have been doing aggressively for years now, is so deeply offensive
to me. It shows such utter disrespect to me as a user, and shows that
Microsoft and Apple see me not as an end user, but as a ripe plum ready
to be bled dry at every turn. It’s revolting. As the latest release,
Windows 11 has always been the most ad-ridden of the Windows releases
still in use, but it seems Windows users can’t escape the onslaught
either. I’m especially expecting ever more aggressive ads and upsells
for Windows 11 to appear in Windows 10 now that the 2025 cutoff date for
Windows 10 support is nearing, of course appearing at the most
inopportune times – because everybody loves a giant fullscreen ad on
your operating system when you’re trying to give a presentation or meet
that tight deadline you forced yourself yo stress about by playing a bit
too much League of Legends. If you want an ad- and upsell-free operating
system, your options are legion – there’s countless Linux distributions
and the various BSDs to choose from.</p>

about it. Electron-to-chromium is an NPM package that maps Electron
versions to Chromium versions so you can input e.g. Electron 32 and get
back Chrome 128. This is useful because a lot of […]

Last week’s jobless numbers revealed that more than 1.8 million people
were drawing unemployment. Among the irks for would-be workers? A
frustrating uptick in the number of “ghost jobs,” or postings that stay
up on jobs sites for months on end without a hire. Also on the show: a
moment of clarity on the future of interest rates and the sunsetting of
a free COVID-19 vaccine program for uninsured adults.

out</a> in the parking lot at Rivian’s Normal, Illinois, plant on
Saturday, damaging dozens of cars before being extinguished. The plant
itself was not affected, according to the Normal Fire Department, and no
one was injured. The source of the blaze is under investigation.
Rivian’s Normal factory produces all of the EV company’s current models.
Last week Rivian got the city’s approval to expand the plant by about
1.3 million square feet to manufacture the upcoming mass-market R2 SUV.
EVs catch fire less often than gas-powered cars, but they burn hotter
and are harder to put out once alight.

Fauci was hospitalized with fever, chills, and fatigue but is now at

LaPook, the chief medical correspondent for CBS News, Fauci thinks he
was infected after being bitten by a mosquito in his backyard. West Nile

what’s going on with plug-in hybrid cars, which have been on the market
for more than a decade but are experiencing a bit of a revival as of
late. The number of models on sale in the U.S. has nearly doubled over
the last five years, to 47, and sales were up 60% in the U.S. in the
first quarter of 2024. While conventional hybrids come with a small
battery and motor that helps power the car’s engine to reduce fuel use,
plug-in hybrids have a bigger battery that’s strong enough to run the
vehicle exclusively on electricity for a little while before the gas
engine takes over. The recent rise in sales is attributed in part to
automakers being forced to comply with new tailpipe emissions rules, and
drivers being EV curious but not quite ready to abandon gas entirely.
“Plug-in hybrids balance the need to reduce vehicle emissions and offer
consumers an entry point to electrified vehicles,” a Stellantis
spokesperson told the <em><em>Journal</em></em>. GM is bringing back
plug-in hybrids in 2027 after axing the Chevrolet Volt. Toyota,
Volkswagen, and Ford are all either considering rolling out a plug-in
hybrid in the U.S. or expanding existing lineups.

landslide kills 1,injures 3 in Ketchikan, authorities say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ANCHORAGE, Alaska — One person was killed and three were injured by a
landslide that prompted a mandatory evacuation in the Alaska city of
Ketchikan, authorities said.</p>
<p>Three people were transported to Ketchikan Medical Center following
the landslide, which struck around 4 p.m. Sunday and damaged homes and
infrastructure, the Ketchikan Gateway Borough and City of Ketchikan said
in a joint statement Sunday.</p>
<p>Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy declared an emergency for Ketchikan, while
Borough Mayor Rodney Dial and city Mayor Dave Kiffer issued a separate
emergency declaration.</p>
<p>“Friends, is with a heavy heart we relay that a landslide in the city
has taken a life, caused several injuries, damaged homes and impacted
our community,” Dial said in the statement.</p>
<p>Kiffer said the loss of life was “heartbreaking, and my heart goes
out to those who lost their homes.”</p>
<p>“In my 65 years in Ketchikan, I have never seen a slide of this
magnitude. With the slides we have seen across the region, there is
clearly a region-wide issue that we need to try to understand with the
support of our State geologist,” Kiffer said.</p>
<p>Two of the victims were admitted to the hospital and one was treated
and released. All other individuals have been accounted for, the
statement said.</p>
<p>Multiple homes were impacted by the landslide and a mandatory
evacuation was ordered for residents of Third Avenue and nearby streets,
while a shelter was set up at Ketchikan High School, the borough and
city said.</p>
<p>A potential secondary landslide area was identified to the south of
the original slide location and crews were standing by, the statement
said.</p>
