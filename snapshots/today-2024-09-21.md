## California governor signs law to protect children from social media addiction

date: 2024-09-21, from: VOA News USA

SACRAMENTO, California — California will make it illegal for social media platforms to knowingly provide addictive feeds to children without parental consent beginning in 2027 under a new law Governor Gavin Newsom signed Friday. 


California follows New York state, which passed a law earlier this year allowing parents to block their kids from getting social media posts suggested by a platform's algorithm. Utah has passed laws in recent years aimed at limiting children's access to social media, but those have faced challenges in court. 


The California law will take effect in a state home to some of the largest technology companies in the world. Similar proposals have failed to pass in recent years, but Newsom signed a first-in-the-nation law in 2022 barring online platforms from using users' personal information in ways that could harm children. 


It is part of a growing push in states across the country to try to address the impact of social media on the well-being of children. 


"Every parent knows the harm social media addiction can inflict on their children — isolation from human contact, stress and anxiety, and endless hours wasted late into the night," Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement. "With this bill, California is helping protect children and teenagers from purposely designed features that feed these destructive habits." 


The law bans platforms from sending notifications without permission from parents to minors between midnight and 6 a.m., and between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m. on weekdays from September through May, when children are typically in school. The legislation also makes platforms set children's accounts to private by default. 


Opponents of the legislation say it could inadvertently prevent adults from accessing content if they cannot verify their age. Some argue it would threaten online privacy by making platforms collect more information on users. 


The law defines an "addictive feed" as a website or app "in which multiple pieces of media generated or shared by users are, either concurrently or sequentially, recommended, selected, or prioritized for display to a user based, in whole or in part, on information provided by the user, or otherwise associated with the user or the user's device," with some exceptions. 


The subject garnered renewed attention in June when U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called on Congress to require warning labels on social media platforms and their impacts on young people. Attorneys general in 42 states endorsed the plan in a letter sent to Congress last week. 


State Senator Nancy Skinner, a Democrat representing Berkeley who wrote the California law, said that "social media companies have designed their platforms to addict users, especially our kids." 


"With the passage of SB 976, the California Legislature has sent a clear message: When social media companies won't act, it's our responsibility to protect our kids," she said in a statement.

## Parts of US Midwest could offer fall's most vibrant foliage

date: 2024-09-21, from: VOA News USA

PORTLAND, Maine — Fall is back, and bringing with it jack-o'-lanterns, football, pumpkin spice everything and — in some parts of the country — especially vibrant foliage.


Leaves around the northern United States are starting to turn orange, yellow and red, inspiring legions of leaf lovers to hop in their cars and travel to the countryside for the best look at fall's fireworks. Leaf peeping — the act of traveling to witness nature's annual kaleidoscope — contributes billions of dollars to the economy, especially in New England and New York.


But this year, some of the most colorful displays could be in the Midwest. AccuWeather, the commercial forecasting service, said in early September that it expects especially vibrant foliage in states such as Michigan and Illinois.


The service also said powerful, popping colors are expected in upstate New York and parts of Pennsylvania, while New England will follow a more typical color pattern. But that doesn't mean New England travelers will miss out.


Maine, the most forested state in the country, had "an abundance of daily sunshine with just the right amount of rainfall to set the stage for a breathtaking foliage season," said Gale Ross, the state's fall foliage spokesperson. Color change and timing depend on the weather in the fall, but cooler nighttime temperatures and shorter days should enhance the colors, Ross said.


"The growing season of 2024 has been excellent for trees, supporting tree health and resilience that should lead to brilliant fall colors throughout Maine," said Aaron Bergdahl, the state's forest pathologist.


Fall colors peak at different times around the U.S., with the foliage season sometimes starting not long after Labor Day in the far northern reaches of the country and extending into November further to the south. In Maine alone, peak foliage can arrive in the northern part of the state in late September and not arrive in coastal areas until close to Halloween.


Leaf turn happens when summer yields to fall and temperatures drop and the amount of sunlight decreases. Chlorophyll in leaves then breaks down, and that allows their fall colors to shine through before leaf drop.


However, weather conditions associated with climate change have disrupted some recent leaf peeping seasons. A warming planet has brought drought that causes leaves to turn brown and wither before reaching peak colors.


Other enemies of leaf peeping include heat waves that cause leaves to fall before autumn arrives and extreme weather events like hurricanes that strip trees of their leaves. A summer heatwave in the Pacific Northwest in 2021 caused a condition called "foliage scorch" that prematurely browned leaves.


This year in Maine, leaf turn was still very sparse in most of the state as late September approached, but the state office of tourism was already gearing up for an influx of tourists. Northern Maine was already experiencing moderate color change. And neighboring New Hampshire was expecting about 3.7 million visitors — more than twice the state's population.


"It's no surprise people travel from all over the world to catch the incredible color," said New Hampshire Travel and Tourism Director Lori Harnois.

## Climate protesters say pace of change isn't fast enough

date: 2024-09-21, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Six years after a teenage Greta Thunberg walked out of school in a solitary climate protest outside of the Swedish parliament, people around a warming globe marched in youth-led protest, saying their voices are being heard but not sufficiently acted upon.


Emissions of heat-trapping gases and temperatures have been rising and oil and gas drilling has continued, even as the protests that kicked off major weeklong climate events in New York City have become annual events. This year, they come days before the United Nations convenes two special summits, one concentrating on sea level rise and the other on the future.


The young people who organized these marches with Fridays for Future said there is frustration with inaction but also hope. People marched in Berlin, Rio de Janeiro, New Delhi and elsewhere, but the focus often is in New York City because of Climate Week NYC. Diplomats, business leaders and activists are concentrating their discussions on the money end of fighting climate change — something not lost on protesters.


"We hope that the government and the financial sector make polluters pay for the damage that they have imposed on our environment," said Uganda Fridays for Future founder Hilda Flavia Nakabuye, who was among a few hundred marching in New York Friday, a far cry from the tens of thousands that protested in a multigroup mega-rally in 2023.




The New York protest wants to take aim at "the pillars of fossil fuels" — companies that pollute, banks that fund them and leaders who are failing on climate, said Helen Mancini, an organizer and a senior at the city's Stuyvesant High School.


"A lot of older people want to make sure the economy is intact, and that's their main concern," said Julia Demairo, a sophomore at Pace University. "I think worrying about the future and the environment is worrying about the economy."


On a day that was at least 8 degrees warmer than average, protest signs included "This is not what we mean by Hot Girl Summer," while others focused on the theme of fighting the coal, oil and gas industries: "Youth Didn't Vote for Fossil Fuels," "Don't Be a Fossil Fool" and "Climate Crisis = Extermination By Capitalism."


Nakabuye said she was in New York to represent Uganda "that is bearing the brunt of the climate crisis."


"We feel like we are creating an impact in the community. However, we are not listened to enough; there is more that needs to be done, especially right now when the climate catastrophes are intensifying," said Nakabuye. "We need to even raise our voices more to demand change and to demand that fuels should end."


In the six years since Thunberg founded what became Fridays for Future, global carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels have increased by about 2.15%, according to Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists who monitor carbon pollution.


The growth of emissions has slowed compared with previous decades and experts anticipate peaking soon, but that's a far cry from the 43% reduction that a U.N. report said is needed to keep temperature increases to an agreed-upon limit.


Since 2019, carbon dioxide emissions from coal have increased by nearly 900 million metric tons, while natural gas emissions have increased slightly and oil pollution has dropped a tiny amount, according to the International Energy Agency, or IEA. That growth has been driven by China, India and developing nations.


But emissions from advanced or industrialized economies have been falling and in 2023 were the lowest in more than 50 years, according to the IEA. Coal emissions in rich countries are down to levels seen around the year 1900, and the United Kingdom next month is set to shutter its last coal plant.


In the past five years, clean energy sources have grown twice as fast as fossil fuels, with solar and wind individually growing faster than fossil fuel-based electricity, according to the IEA. Developing countries — where more than 80% of the world population lives — say that they need financial help to curb their increasing use of fossil fuels.


Since 2018, the globe has warmed more than 0.29 degrees Celsius, with last year setting a record for the hottest year and this year poised to break that mark, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the European climate agency Copernicus.


"We're making progress, even if it's slow progress," said 17-year-old Ashen Harper of Connecticut, a veteran protester turned organizer. "Our job right now is to accelerate that progress."


In Berlin, hundreds of people took to the streets, although in fewer numbers than in previous years. Activists held up signs saying, "Save the Climate" and "Coal is Over!" as they watched a gig put on outside the German Chancellor's Office. Protesters in London held up letters spelling out "Pay Up," calling for the country to pay more to adapt to climate change and transition away from fossil fuels.

## Volunteer network of interpreters hopes to make refugees' languages more accessible via AI

date: 2024-09-21, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — They may be Tigrinya speakers fleeing the authoritarian Eritrean government's indefinite military service policy. Or Rohingya people escaping ethnic violence in Myanmar. But refugees navigating resettlement often face a shared hurdle: poor machine translations and a short supply of interpreters knowledgeable in their less-serviced languages.


Tarjimly, a Google-backed nonprofit described as "Uber for translators," aims to help asylum seekers clear that hurdle. Through a new artificial intelligence partnership, Tarjimly trains outside large language models while allowing its volunteers to respond more urgently to needs for translators. It's a feedback loop where humans teach the nuances of each language to the machines by sharing data from one-on-one calls and correcting automated translations.


And it's this uniquely human realm of language that Tarjimly co-founder Atif Javed believes exemplifies the ever-tricky balance between individuals' ingenuity and technological advancement. He says it's the needed personal touch that shows why AI's rapid development shouldn't generally stoke widespread fears.


Languages popular in the Global South — such as the Dari and Pashto commonly spoken in Afghanistan, home to one of the world's largest protracted refugee crises — have the worst quality coverage, according to Javed. He feels well positioned to supplement the internet's English-dominated information troves that train services like Google Translate with his mobile app's more diverse data sets.


Tarjimly connects refugees with on-demand interpreters, who can communicate during meetings with social workers, immigration officials and doctors, and records the encounters for AI training. To comply with patient privacy protections, Tarjimly anonymizes the conversations on its app. Javed said the nonprofit also has on option for "no record" sessions where none of the data is stored for alternative uses.




Many of its 60,000 volunteers are multilingual refugees themselves who more intimately understand not only their counterpart's native tongue but also the crisis that brought them there, according to Javed.


Among them is Roza Tesfazion, a 26-year-old Eritrean refugee who works professionally as an interpreter for the United Kingdom's government. Fluent in Amharic and Tigrinya, she studied English and Swahili to help her immigrant family overcome language barriers when they first moved to Kenya.


Tesfazion said she translates at no cost because she knows "how emotional it is" for the people on the other side of her sessions.


"You have to have that touch of human emotions to it," she said.


Tarjimly's founders say their mission's sensitive nature lends itself to nonprofit status more than a corporate structure. Users arrive in very vulnerable positions, and the nonprofit works with established humanitarian groups including Catholic Charities, the International Rescue Committee and the United Nations' International Organization for Migration.


The work requires a level of trust that would have been difficult to earn in a "for-profit, competitive world," according to Javed. "The underlying engine of our success is the community we've built."


That community, however, also has room for artificial intelligence. A $1.3 million grant from Google.org has enabled a "First Pass" tool that gives an instantly generated translation for human volunteers to revise. A new information hub will open up its language data for partners, including Google, in early 2025.


But refining a more diverse library of languages will require conversational data at a scale much broader than Tarjimly can likely provide on its own, according to Data & Society researcher Ranjit Singh.


Singh, who studies the social implications of automation and inclusive digital solutions, said translation services will always need a "real person in the middle."


"There is one part of it which is translation and another part of it which is just trying to understand somebody's life situation," he said. "Technologies help us do some of this work. But at the same time, it's also fairly social."


Tarjimly was inspired by Javed's time volunteering with Arabic speakers at refugee camps in Greece and Turkey after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and working in Silicon Valley. A Muslim American whose family immigrated to the United States in 2001, Javed said he was reminded of his own childhood translating for his refugee grandmother.


His lived experience is one reason why Elevate Prize Foundation CEO Carolina Garcìa Jayaram said her organization awarded $300,000 last year to Tarjimly. That "proximate leadership" helps nonprofits better understand developments like artificial intelligence that "can be both cause for excitement and trepidation," Jayaram said. The risk-averse philanthropic sector may be slow to catch up with disruptive new technologies, she noted, but shouldn't ignore their positive applications.


"It's a great example of how not to get stuck in that bogeyman complex about AI," she said. "To go to leaders who are closest to those issues and say, 'How would AI unlock the possibilities and opportunities for your organization?'"

## Residents of Springfield, Ohio, wait for political firestorm to blow over

date: 2024-09-21, from: VOA News USA

SPRINGFIELD, Ohio  — In the quiet corners of Springfield, Ohio — out of sight of the drumbeat of politicians and journalists, troopers and newly installed security cameras — the people who live here are taking a breath, praying and attempting to carry on.


Between the morning bomb sweeps of Springfield's schools and the near daily afternoon media briefings, a hush comes over the city of 58,000 that residents say is uncanny, haunting even. It's fear. It's confusion — dismay at being transformed overnight into a target for the nation's vitriol.


Pastor Andy Mobley, who runs the Family Needs Inc. food pantry on the city's south side, said people are hunkered down out of the public eye. He said they're hoping the attention sparked by former President Donald Trump spreading unsubstantiated rumors about the city's legal Haitian immigrants eating house pets during last week's presidential debate will blow over.


Trump and his vice presidential running mate, Ohio's junior Sen. JD Vance, have used the cat-eating rumors to draw attention to the city's 15,000 Haitian immigrants, whose arrival to fill manufacturing, distribution and warehouse jobs has put a severe strain on local resources.


Since the Republican candidates' initial comments, more than two dozen bomb threats — mostly from foreign actors seeking to sow discord — have prompted the state to send in additional state troopers and install surveillance cameras around the city in order to reopen schools and government buildings.




"We've got good people here. Republican, Democrat. They're good people," Mobley said Tuesday, as the pantry tended to a steady stream of clients seeking clothing and food.


Resident Josh Valle said the situation is unsettling.


"We definitely need answers," said the 35-year-old tool and die repairman, who has lived in Springfield for decades. "It's affecting my kids and my community and my neighbors. With the bomb threats and the influx, it's something new every day. And this used to be a really chill town, you know, it used to be just a small town Ohio."


The area around Springfield City Hall, where Valle spoke, sat largely silent Tuesday afternoon, until a news conference with state and local officials prompted a brief swarm of activity. Local families are avoiding schools in the wake of earlier bomb threats, even though dozens of troopers have fanned out across the Springfield City School District to stand guard. Some 200 of 500 students were absent Tuesday from a single elementary school, officials said.


Still, there are signs of hope.


"Home Sweet Springfield" tea towels adorn the window of Champion City Guide & Supply on a downtown block that bustles with activity over the lunch hour. One line of mugs and clothing items reads: "Speak a Good Word for Springfield — or say nothing."


Across town, a small group of kids whose parents kept them home on Tuesday horsed around together at a makeshift lemonade stand they set up to make a few bucks. They delighted in the revving motor of a passing muscle car and, when sales were slow, swigged back the merchandise.


David Graham, who visits communities in crisis as The Praying Cowboy, positioned himself in Springfield this week to show support. "Agenda: Pray, worship, witness, smile, honor, esteem," he wrote in a Facebook post from the city, accompanied by his hands holding an open Bible with a newly installed surveillance platform in the background. He added lines with black electrical tape to a small heart placard he posted nearby, to represent Springfield hearts being broken.


He wasn't the only one trying to help. A bipartisan group of area mayors met with Springfield Mayor Rob Rue on Monday to figure out how they can help — including with resources to address the traffic, health care, social services and housing needs prompted by the increase in the Haitian population and their language barrier.


Andrew Ginther, the Democratic mayor of Ohio's capital, Columbus, and president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, said in a statement: "Mayors across America will continue to stand by Springfield and all cities working to responsibly address an increased number of migrants, which we can do without losing sight of our shared humanity."


Years ago, Family Needs Inc. was designated one of President George H.W. Bush's "thousand points of light," honoring its dedication to volunteerism. The organization has helped Haitians arriving in Springfield for years now, Mobley said — providing them translation services and co-signing their rental agreements.




He recalled working with Haitian immigrants as far back as 2016, the year Trump was elected — though census figures show the population remained at only about 400 until a few years ago.


"In 2016, we started signing contracts. Through the pandemic, we were doing things for the Haitian community," he said. "Has that all been forgotten? They have been here, and we've been dealing with this, and we've been asking for help through two different administrations. And no administration has helped us, until now this thing has become public."


As she walked downtown, one resident who declined to give her name said she's not letting the situation get her down.


"It's childish. It's stupid. It took one stupid person to get on a debate and ruin the reputation of a community. I think you know exactly who I'm talking about," she said.


"He should never have said that. There's no truth to those allegations whatsoever. I was born and raised in this town, I'm staying here, and I have no problem with nobody."

## How three US men ended up facing death penalty over Congo coup attempt

date: 2024-09-21, from: VOA News USA

KINSHASA, Democratic Republic of Congo  — A military court in Democratic Republic of Congo, one of Africa's largest countries, has convicted three Americans and dozens of others of taking part in a coup attempt and imposed "the harshest penalty, that of death."


The court convicted the 37 defendants, including the three Americans and imposed the death penalty in a verdict delivered by presiding judge Maj. Freddy Ehuma at an open-air military court proceeding.


The defendants, a majority of them Congolese but also including a Briton, a Belgian and a Canadian, were charged with terrorism, murder, criminal association and illegal possession of weapons, among other charges.


The lawyer who defended the six foreigners said they would appeal the verdicts.


The U.S. State Department strongly discourages travel to Congo, warning of violent crime and civil unrest. Here's how the three Americans ended up in the middle of the coup attempt.


What happened during the coup attempt in May?


In Congo's capital Kinshasa, a ragtag group including three Americans tried to unseat the country's President Felix Tshisekedi. They were led by a little-known opposition figure, Christian Malanga, who sold used cars and dabbled in gold mining before persuading his Utah-born son to join in the foiled coup.




The coup attempt began at the Kinshasa residence of Tshisekedi's close ally, Vital Kamerhe, a federal legislator and a candidate for Speaker of the National Assembly of Congo. His guards killed some of the attackers, officials said.


Christian Malanga, meanwhile, was live-streaming video from the presidential palace in which he is seen surrounded by several armed men in military uniforms wandering around in the middle of the night. He was later killed while resisting arrest, Congolese authorities said.


Dozens, including Malanga's son and two other Americans, were arrested and brought to a high-security military prison in Kinshasa. Family members said the young men have been sleeping on the floor, struggling with health issues and have had to pay for food and hygiene products.


Christian Malanga, the unlikely coup leader


Malanga, who was born in Kinshasa, had described himself as a refugee who thrived after settling in the U.S. with his family in the 1990s. He said he became a leader of a Congolese opposition political party and met high-level officials in Washington and the Vatican. He also described himself as a devoted husband and father of eight.


Court records and interviews paint another picture. In 2001, the year he turned 18, Malanga was convicted in Utah of assault with a firearm, which resulted in a 30-day jail sentence and three years of probation. That same year, he was charged with domestic violence assault in one incident and battery and disturbing the peace in another, but he pleaded not guilty and all counts in both cases were dismissed.


In 2004, he was charged with domestic violence with threat of using a dangerous weapon, but he pleaded not guilty and the charges were again dismissed. Since 2004, records show several cases related to a custody dispute and a child support dispute.


How three young Americans got involved in a coup attempt


The three imprisoned Americans are Malanga's 21-year-old son Marcel Malanga, Tyler Thompson Jr., 21, who flew to Africa from Utah with the younger Malanga for what his family believed was a free vacation, and Benjamin Reuben Zalman-Polun, 36, who is reported to have known Christian Malanga through a gold mining company.




Marcel Malanga is a U.S. citizen and was born in Utah. He told the court his father had threatened to kill him and Thompson if they did not take part in the attack.


His mother, Brittney Sawyer, has said her son is innocent and was simply following his father, who considered himself president of a shadow government in exile.


Thompson was his high school friend and football teammate in the Salt Lake City suburb of West Jordan. He was the only former teammate to accept Marcel Malanga's invitation to travel to Congo, according to several other players who told The Associated Press they had been invited to what the younger Malanga pitched interchangeably as a family vacation or as a service trip to build wells. Other teammates alleged that Marcel Malanga had offered up to $100,000 to join him on a "security job" in Congo.


Thompson's family maintains he had no knowledge of the elder Malanga's intentions, no plans for political activism and didn't even plan to enter Congo. He and the Malangas were meant to travel only to South Africa and Eswatini, his stepmother, Miranda Thompson, said.


Here's what happens next


All of those convicted have five days to appeal the verdict. Richard Bondo, the lawyer who defended the Americans and three other foreigners, said he plans to do so.


Congo reinstated the death penalty earlier this year, lifting a more than two-decade-old moratorium, as authorities struggle to curb violence and militant attacks in the country. The men convicted in the coup attempt would likely be executed by firing squad.


The U.S. State Department has not declared the Americans wrongfully detained, making it unlikely that U.S. officials would try to negotiate their return.

## Biden opens home to Quad leaders for farewell summit

date: 2024-09-21, from: VOA News USA

Wilmington, Delaware — President Joe Biden hosted Australia's prime minister at his Delaware home Friday at the start of a weekend summit with the "Quad" group he has pushed as a counterweight to China. 


Biden chose Wilmington for a summit of leaders from Australia, India and Japan — the last of his presidency after he dropped out of the 2024 election against Donald Trump and handed the Democratic campaign reins to Vice President Kamala Harris. 


After a one-on-one meeting at his property with Australia's Anthony Albanese on Friday night, he will welcome Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at his home on Saturday. 


Biden will then host an "intimate" dinner and full four-way summit that day at his former high school in the city. 


"This will be President Biden's first time hosting foreign leaders in Wilmington as president — a reflection of his deep personal relationships with each of the Quad leaders," said press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.  


Harris will not be attending, the White House said. 




The Quad grouping dates to 2007, but Biden has strongly pushed it as part of an emphasis on international alliances after the isolationist Trump years. 


China was expected to feature heavily in their discussions amid tensions with Beijing, particularly a series of recent confrontations between Chinese and Philippine vessels in the disputed South China Sea. 


"It will certainly be high on the agenda," National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said, adding that the four leaders had a "common understanding about the challenges that the PRC [People's Republic of China] is posing." 


The White House, however, faced criticism for giving only limited access to the press throughout the weekend, with reporters questioning whether it was at the request of the media-shy Modi. 


The prime minister was coaxed to take two questions during a state visit to the White House in 2023 but had not held an open press conference at home in his previous nine years in power. 


The White House insisted Biden would not shy away from addressing rights issues with Modi, who has faced accusations of growing authoritarianism. 


"There's not a conversation that he has with foreign leaders where he doesn't talk about the importance of respecting human and civil rights, and that includes with Prime Minister Modi," Kirby said. 


India is to host the next Quad summit in 2025. 


Biden is famously proud of his home in Wilmington, about 176 kilometers from Washington, and he frequently spends weekends there away from the White House.

## US soldier who entered North Korea pleads guilty to desertion

date: 2024-09-21, from: VOA News USA

Washington — A U.S. soldier who crossed into North Korea last year pleaded guilty to desertion on Friday as part of a plea agreement and was sentenced to 12 months of confinement, his lawyer said.


Because of good behavior and time served, the soldier was released, according to the lawyer.


Travis King was facing 14 charges related to him fleeing across the border from South Korea into the North in July 2023 while on a sightseeing tour of the Demilitarized Zone that divides the Korean Peninsula, and for prior incidents.


But he pleaded guilty to just five — desertion, assault on a noncommissioned officer, and three counts of disobeying an officer — as part of a deal that was accepted on Friday by a military judge.


"The judge, under the terms of the plea deal, sentenced Travis to one year of confinement, reduction in rank to private (E-1), forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and a dishonorable discharge," a statement from King's attorney Franklin Rosenblatt said.


"With time already served and credit for good behavior, Travis is now free and will return home," the statement said.


"Travis King has faced significant challenges throughout his life, including a difficult upbringing, exposure to criminal environments, and struggles with mental health," Rosenblatt said. "All these factors have compounded the hardships he faced in the military."


In a statement, the U.S. Army's Office of Special Trial Counsel confirmed King's guilty plea as part of a deal and said that "pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement, all other charges and specifications were dismissed."


"The outcome of today's court martial is a fair and just result that reflects the seriousness of the offenses committed by Pvt. King," prosecutor Major Allyson Montgomery said in the statement.


At the time of the incident, King had been stationed in South Korea, and after a drunken bar fight and a stay in South Korean jail, he was supposed to fly back to Texas to face disciplinary hearings.


Instead, he walked out of the Seoul-area airport, joined a DMZ sightseeing trip and slipped over the fortified border where he was detained by the communist North's authorities.


Pyongyang had said that King had defected to North Korea to escape "mistreatment and racial discrimination in the U.S. Army."


But after completing its investigation, North Korea "decided to expel" King in September for illegally intruding into its territory.

## Qualcomm wants to buy Intel

date: 2024-09-20, from: OS News

On Friday afternoon, The Wall Street Journal reported Intel had been approached by fellow chip giant Qualcomm about a possible takeover. While any deal is described as “far from certain,” according to the paper’s unnamed sources, it would represent a tremendous fall for a company that had been the most valuable chip company in the world, based largely on its x86 processor technology that for years had triumphed over Qualcomm’s Arm chips outside of the phone space. ↫ Richard Lawler and Sean Hollister at The Verge Either Qualcomm is only interested in buying certain parts of Intel&#8217;s business, or we&#8217;re dealing with someone trying to mess with stock prices for personal gain. The idea of Qualcomm acquiring Intel seems entirely outlandish to me, and that&#8217;s not even taking into account that regulators will probably have a thing or two to say about this. The one thing such a crazy deal would have going for it is that it would create a pretty strong and powerful all-American chip giant, which is a PR avenue the companies might explore if this is really serious. One of the most valuable assets Intel has is the x86 architecture and the associated patents and licensing deals, and the immense market power that comes with those. Perhaps Qualcomm is interested in designing x86 chips, or, more likely, perhaps they&#8217;re interested in all that sweet, sweet licensing money they could extract by allowing more companies to design and sell x86 processors. The x86 market currently consists almost exclusively of Intel and AMD, a situation which may be leaving a lot of licensing money on the table. Pondering aside, I highly doubt this is anything other than an overblown, misinterpreted story.

## War set to dominate agenda at UN General Assembly meeting

date: 2024-09-20, from: VOA News USA

UNITED NATIONS — World leaders are set to descend on the United Nations in the coming days to talk about a lengthy list of global challenges. But will they spur significant action on any of them?


"We see out-of-control geopolitical divisions and runaway conflicts — not least in Ukraine, Gaza, Sudan and beyond," U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters at a news conference ahead of the annual U.N. General Assembly meetings.


Those three wars are set to dominate the agenda — both in leaders' speeches before the assembly and at numerous side meetings.


Gaza 


Getting to a cease-fire in Gaza is even more urgent now that Israel has turned its attention to its northern border with Lebanon and looks determined to build on a significant blow to Hezbollah militants there.


"We are at the start of a new phase in the war — it requires courage, determination and perseverance on our part," Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told soldiers at the northern Ramat David Airbase on Wednesday. "It is critical that we operate in close cooperation between the [security] organizations, at all levels."


Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas plan to address the General Assembly.


"President Abbas will focus on the plight of his people — he will focus on the genocide campaign that's taking place, he will warn of the danger of this conflict exploding in the West Bank, and will warn also of the dangers of this conflict not reaching a cease-fire soon, in terms of its implications for the region and regional stability," Randa Slim, senior fellow at the Washington-based Middle East Institute, told VOA.


In March, a U.N. official said there were reasonable grounds to believe genocide had been committed in Gaza.


Slim continued, "On the other hand, you are going to see the Israeli prime minister reminding people of the terror of October 7, casting the light on the fact that they are in a war of defense, and he is going to reemphasize the priorities of the war … which is the eradication of Hamas."


In March, Francesca Albanese, the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, said there were "reasonable grounds" to think Israel has been committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.


Ukraine 


More than 2½ years after Russia invaded Ukraine, peace remains elusive.


Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be in New York calling for international support at a critical time in the war, and as the conflict, in many capitals, has been superseded by the situation in Gaza.


"I think Ukrainian diplomats themselves are a bit worried that their war is going down the agenda," Richard Gowan, U.N. director at International Crisis Group, told VOA. "But the reality is that the battle between Israel and Hamas has torn the U.N. apart over the last year, and that is going to be the number one focus for a lot of presidents and prime ministers."


On Tuesday, Zelenskyy will address a high-level U.N. Security Council meeting on Ukraine, and the following day he will speak at the General Assembly.


"I think he will emphasize the problem of Russian aggression, and that not only Europe, but the rest of the world, must remain on guard for Russia's attempt to assert its imperial powers," William Pomeranz, senior fellow at the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute told VOA. "And that the support of Ukraine is a crucial part of global security at the present time."


On Thursday, Zelenskyy will head to Washington to meet with President Joe Biden at the White House.


Russian President Vladimir Putin will not be coming to New York, but veteran Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is scheduled to address the General Assembly on September 28.


Sudan 


On the African continent, two rival generals in Sudan have been mired in a brutal 17-month struggle for power that has devastated the country. Violence, famine and disease are stalking the population, and 10 million people have fled their homes in search of safety.


The war's current epicenter is the North Darfur capital of El Fasher, where the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces have advanced on the city and the Sudanese Armed Forces inside El Fasher have been trying to repel them.


"The lives of hundreds of thousands of people, including more than 700,000 internally displaced persons in and around El Fasher, are at immediate threat," acting U.N. humanitarian chief Joye Msuya told the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday.


The United States, Saudi Arabia, African Union and others have pursued a variety of peace initiatives for months. They have failed to silence the guns, but the U.S. has been successful in opening up some new routes for humanitarian relief into Sudan.


On September 25, ministers will meet to discuss the humanitarian response at a session organized by officials from the U.N., U.S, European Union, African Union, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.


The head of the Sudanese Armed Forces and chairman of the Transitional Sovereignty Council, General Abdel Fattah Burhan, is coming to New York. U.N. chief Guterres said he would "express my enormous frustration" to him about the lack of a cease-fire and the start of a serious political process.


Haiti 


While it may not grab as many global headlines as Ukraine and Gaza, there is a lot of international solidarity around helping Haiti recover from its latest cycle of insecurity.


The U.N. independent expert on the human rights situation in Haiti wrapped up a visit to the country on Friday and told a news conference that human rights violations are rampant.


"Sexual violence, used as a weapon by gangs to control the population, has drastically increased in recent months," William O'Neill said. "Gangs have increasingly trafficked children, forcibly recruited them into gangs, and often used them to carry out attacks against public institutions and police operations."


A multinational security support mission was approved nearly a year ago in the U.N. Security Council to assist Haitian National Police in subduing criminal gangs terrorizing the capital and other regions. After many delays, the first international police contingent from Kenya deployed in June.


There are now about 500 police in total on the ground — 400 from mission leader Kenya and the rest from Jamaica and Belize. Diplomats say they expect other countries will also be deploying.


Haitian Prime Minister Garry Conille and his Canadian counterpart, Justin Trudeau, are co-chairing a side meeting on Monday that will look at both the urgent humanitarian situation and longer-term development issues.


"I think we are all beginning to understand how drastic the damage in Haiti is and how devastating the current attacks by the gangs has proven to be," Canadian Ambassador Bob Rae told VOA. "We are doing everything we can to mobilize international attention on what we can do to turn that around."


Hello and goodbye 


Several new leaders will make their debut at this year's gathering, including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian.


"I'm going to be looking for any signal he is going to give about restarting the nuclear negotiation," MEI's Slim said of the Iranian leader, noting that his administration has indicated an interest in restarting nuclear talks.


This will be Biden's final time at the General Assembly podium.


"I think his appearance will create mixed emotions among other leaders," said Crisis Group's Gowan. "I think there is still some respect for his engagement with multilateralism, but there is also a lot of regret that he didn't give the U.N. a greater role in dealing with the war in Gaza."


Looking to the future 


Two years ago, Biden announced that the United States supported expanding the number of permanent members on the 15-nation Security Council.


On September 12, his U.N. envoy, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, announced that the administration would support two permanent seats for Africa and one for Latin American and Caribbean countries, in addition to India, Japan and Germany — albeit, without veto power. She said Washington is ready to begin text-based negotiations on the expansion.


"It means we're ready to work with other countries to negotiate language, prepare amendments, and ready this resolution for a vote in the General Assembly and, ultimately, amend the U.N. Charter," Thomas-Greenfield told an audience last week at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.


Security Council reform, as it is known, has for decades been a topic of much discussion but no action. U.N. chief Guterres also would like to see the council change. On Sunday, he opens his signature two-day "Summit of the Future," in which institutional reform will be high on the agenda.


"And one of the questions that is important in relation to the future relates exactly to the role of the P5 [permanent five members] and to the need to have a certain redistribution of power to make things more fair and more effective," Guterres told reporters.


In the seventh year of his 10-year tenure, Guterres wants to see better multilateral cooperation to resolve current conflicts, fight climate change, and ease global hunger and debt. He is also worried about emerging challenges, including the power of artificial intelligence.


He is hoping for a strong "Pact for the Future" to be adopted by consensus on Sunday. The document, a policy blueprint to address global challenges and drastic reforms to the U.N. and global financial institutions, has been mired in difficult negotiations.


Germany and Namibia have been facilitating the negotiations for months and their leaders will co-chair the summit. The president of the General Assembly, Philemon Yang, has now taken over negotiations to try to get it over the finish line.


Diplomats said 19 countries, including Russia, raised objections on Thursday night to some language in the latest draft, including around human rights, climate action and fossil fuels. With less than 48 hours to go until the summit opens, discussions are getting down to the wire.


"We very much hope that member states will agree in the coming hours on a way forward for the Summit of the Future, and show ambition and show courage and do whatever they can to get these documents over the finish line," Guterres' spokesperson said.

## Where Are All the Fictional Movies About Climate Change?

date: 2024-09-20, from: Heatmap News

Recent episodes include “Haunted Doll Bites Child” and “UFO Takes Off in Argentina”; a critic once <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/tv-review-paranormal-caught-on-camera/VGTHMWXRNUAKQDDJAKFLFT3KJ4/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>described it</u></a> as unsuitable for viewers who have developed “some powers of critical thought.” But credit where credit is due: <em><em>Caught on Camera</em></em> cites “climate change” as a possible cause of increased sightings of the Loch Ness monster.</p>
<p>This, alas, is the kind of meager victory the climate movement is often forced to celebrate. </p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.mediaimpactproject.org/climateunscripted.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>research</u></a> by USC Annenberg’s Norman Lear Center, there were just 1,228 mentions of “climate change” in the nearly 200,000 hours of unscripted TV that aired in the U.S. in the six months between September 2022 and February 2023. (Fifty-eight of those mentions were on “paranormal/mystery” programs, including <em><em>Caught on Camera</em></em>.) The situation is even worse for <a href="https://learcenter.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/GlaringAbsence_NormanLearCenter.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>scripted film and TV</u></a>: Between 2016 and 2020, just 0.6% of 37,453 scripts used the words “climate change” during their runtime. While there are notable exceptions — <em><em>An Inconvenient Truth </em></em>won the 2007 documentary Oscar, and <em><em>The Day After Tomorrow </em></em>and <em><em>Don’t Look Up</em></em> were mainstream hits — climate mostly remains off-screen even as <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/change-polling-concern-belief-republicans-vs-democrats#:~:text=44%25%20said%20they%20were%20%E2%80%9Cvery%E2%80%9D%20or%20%E2%80%9Csomewhat%E2%80%9D%20affected" target="_self"><u>nearly half the population</u></a> says it has affected their lives.</p>
<p>Starting a Climate Film Festival, then, might seem foolish — because what would you even program? But New Yorkers are about to find out: The inaugural CFF will open Friday with a sold-out screening of the documentary <em><em>Searching for Amani</em></em> at the Explorer’s Club in Manhattan, with the festival’s 58 other films to be screened primarily at the <a href="https://www.climatefilmfest.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Firehouse Cinema</u></a> over Saturday and Sunday in a de facto kick-off to Climate Week. “Once we started digging, we found that there were an incredible number of these stories being told, but no one was really bringing them together under this rubric,” Alec Turnbull, who co-founded CFF with his wife, J. English Cook, told me.</p>
<p>The supply, however, is noticeably lopsided. CFF received “well over 300 submissions” during its open call for movies this past spring, according to Turnbull — enough that he and the volunteer screeners were able to winnow their broad interpretation of a “climate movie” from anything with “an environmental lens that didn’t have explicit climate themes” to movies specifically <em><em>about</em></em> climate.<em> </em></p>
<p>In the end, though, unscripted documentary-style films and shorts came to dominate roughly 63% of the CFF slate. Only two of the program’s full-length features — the found-footage film <em><em>Earth II</em></em> and DreamWorks’ animated movie <em><em>The Wild Robot</em></em> — are fictional climate narratives.</p>
<p>This disparity might lead to the impression that there are too many climate documentaries in the world. (Seriously, how many more movies and shows can be made about <a href="https://www.regenerativefarmersofamerica.com/documentaries-regenerative-agriculture" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>regenerative farming</u></a>?) While that isn’t the case — at least compared to something like the oversaturated true crime genre — documentary filmmaker might have more access to the subject than their peers in Hollywood because the medium has a “long history of addressing social issues,” Erica Lynn Rosenthal, the director of USC Annenberg’s Norman Lear Center, told me. </p>
<p>At least some mismatch is also likely due to “self-selection bias,” according to Turnbull. He told me that narrative filmmakers might not have submitted to something called the “Climate Film Festival” simply because they “don’t think about the work they’re doing as a climate story.” Another reason might just be endemic to film festivals. “Documentaries are really great for the festival circuit, for impact screenings, and for coupling with resources and workshops,” which boost their visibility even if they “don’t always make it to a broader audience” afterward, Tehya Jennett, whose short scripted horror film “<a href="https://tickets.climatefilmfest.com/films/out-of-plastic-66b81be4898cf000b450be53" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Out of Plastic</u></a>” is playing at CFF, told me.</p>
<p>According to the Norman Lear Center, however, nearly half of mainstream audiences said they <em><em>want</em></em> to see fictional stories that “include climate-related storylines” on screen. That’s far from trivial. “We know from decades of research that stories have the power to shift people’s hearts and minds and move them to action on a variety of topics, whether it’s health behavior or social issues,” Rosenthal said. </p>
<p>Sam Read, a CFF jury member and the executive director of the Sustainable Entertainment Alliance, an advocacy consortium that works to reduce the entertainment industry’s environmental impact, confirmed that the demand for climate narratives “currently outstrips the supply.” But he stressed to me that what makes a climate moment in a script doesn’t have to be something preachy, moralistic, <a href="https://heatmap.news/we-need-better-climate-stories-than-extrapolations" target="_self"><u>alarmist</u></a>, or even terribly overt, pointing to examples like the most recent season of <em><em>Hacks</em></em>, which included <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/hacks-climate-activism-story-line-1235930463/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a bottle episode about climate change</u></a>, and <em><em>True Detective: Night Country</em></em>, with its <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/what-was-true-detective-night-country-really-about" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>environmental and Indigenous plotlines</u></a>. </p>
<p>“If you’re writing a sitcom and the mom is an office worker, could you make the mom a solar panel technician?” he asked, adding: “There are ways to both help people see what a clean energy future can look like while also exploring how this is affecting communities and how people are responding to it.”</p>
<p>Scripted examples, though, remain relatively rare. In the Norman Lear Center’s research, just 10% of the thousands of mentions of extreme weather in film and TV shows actually made any sort of link to global warming, perhaps because producers or executives worry that referencing climate change is political and might estrange half their audience. “The idea that [climate change] is going to alienate or turn off audiences is really an outdated perception,” Rosenthal said. Still, it’s even harder to push for experimentation and risk-taking when the film industry at large is struggling. And despite how it might look at CFF, it’s the <em><em>documentarians</em></em> who have <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/full-frame-documentary-filmmakers-hollywood-cutbacks-deal-1235962142/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>been hit extra hard</u></a> by the post-COVID turbulence in the movie world.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this is to say that documentaries are any less creative, ambitious, or worthy of being in a festival slate than their scripted counterparts. In fact, the Climate Film Festival’s centerpiece, <em><em>The Here Now Project</em></em>, is a documentary entirely composed of found footage of real people filming weather disasters during 2021. “Two people in the film actually say, ‘This is a horror movie,’” Greg Jacobs, who co-directed the documentary with Jon Siskel, told me. </p>
<p>Maybe it doesn’t really matter, then, in what exact form these stories are getting told: in a world with a changing climate, truth and fiction are equally strange.</p>

## Microsoft’s Mega Deal Is a Massive Victory for Nuclear Power

date: 2024-09-20, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzY1MzU4My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NjA4MDc5M30.vhWTyhSByO96FRj3yBzZ3poBW2RYMeEMIqcIB2W356A/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">After Three Mile Island, what’s next? </p><p>That’s the question the nuclear industry and those who follow it were asking after news broke Friday that Constellation Energy was planning to <a href="https://www.constellationenergy.com/newsroom/2024/Constellation-to-Launch-Crane-Clean-Energy-Center-Restoring-Jobs-and-Carbon-Free-Power-to-The-Grid.html" target="_blank">reboot the facility’s Unit 1</a>, which shut down in 2019. The deal is being anchored by Microsoft, which will purchase the power in order to balance out the emissions generated by its facilities in the PJM Interconnection, the multi-state power market that includes Pennsylvania. The plant is expected to be operational by 2028, Constellation said, and will be called the Crane Clean Energy Center, in honor of the company's former chief executive.</p><p>The demand for non-carbon-emitting power — and all power — has grown since Unit 1 closed and is expected to continue to in the future, especially as tech companies like Microsoft seek to build more datacenters while complying with their pledges to power their operations without greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>The days of nuclear power plants shuttering not because of old age, safety concerns, or local opposition, but because of the economics of subsidized wind and solar and cheap natural gas, are likely over. New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Illinois all provided subsidies to their state’s nuclear fleet as plants were threatened with closure. California’s Diablo Canyon plant has seen its decommissioning delayed and received federal aid to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-diablo-canyon-nuclear-reactors-a57c50bb96fc83a9125b24df8d62e4f3" target="_blank">help stay open</a>. At a time when states representing a big chunk of US power consumption have aggressive emissions reduction goals and worries about power reliability, money is often easily found to keep nuclear plants open.</p><p>And now much of that cash might be coming from the private sector, specifically technology companies and independent power producers like Constellation.<br/><br/>“What we’re seeing is the fruits of previous labors coupled with the first-time-in-a-generation demand signals we had not yet seen,” Brett Rampal, a senior director at Veriten, an energy advisory company, told me.</p><p>These companies want the 24/7 carbon-free power that nuclear can uniquely provide. The federal government and several state capitals are also committed to bolstering the economics of<a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&t=3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> America’s largest non-greenhouse-gas emitting</a>, firm power source.</p><p>The Inflation Reduction Act contains considerable subsidies for both investing in and producing nuclear energy, as well as tools to finance nuclear power.</p><p>If history is any indication, having public and corporate policy rowing in the same direction can provide a huge boost for clean energy. For wind and solar, the two biggest demand boosters pulling forward their adoption has been technology companies wanting to buy clean power and federal subsidies for their construction and operation.</p><p>The structure Microsoft is using to purchase this power, the corporate power purchase agreement, was<a href="https://www.gstatic.com/gumdrop/sustainability/pdf-google-2016-environmental-report.pdf#page=33" target="_blank"><u> pioneered by Google in the late 2000s</u></a> as a way for technology companies to support the development of clear power even when they couldn’t directly consume it. Now these tools are being used to support nuclear power. Constellation said Friday that the deal was the largest single power purchase agreement in history. According to figures worked out by Rampal, the deal will lead to some 135 terawatt-hours of generation over 20 years (a bit short of the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/energy-production-consumption" target="_blank">annual electricity generation of Argentina</a>), generating some $13.5 billion of revenue.</p><p>“Nobody would be moving forward with these projects,” explained Rampal, without tax credits or “extremely favorable loan support from the Loans Program Office.”</p><p>The other shuttered nuclear plant looking to restart, Michigan’s Palisades, <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/08/05/2024-17218/record-of-decision-issuance-of-a-loan-guarantee-to-holtec-palisades-llc-for-general-restoration-and" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has a $1.5 billion loan guarantee from the LPO</u></a>.<br/><br/>“Constellation will be spending $1.6 billion of its own money to restart the plant – no state or federal aid. We may look at whether to seek a DOE loan for some of the financing, but that is not a given and not needed to make the project work. And even in that scenario, all the money is paid back in full. It’s just a slightly better interest rate,” Paul Adams, a Constellation spokesman, told me.</p><p>“The IRA contained nuclear production tax credits, which any nuclear plant is eligible for. The Crane Clean Energy Center<strong> </strong>would be no different once it is up and operating. That tax credit simply provides a floor price, in essence, to support nuclear production,” Adams said.</p><p>Almost immediately after the deal was announced attention turned to the Duane Arnold Energy Center plant in Iowa, which shut down in 2020 but whose owner, NextEra, <a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/NextEra-eyes-restart-opportunity-for-shuttered-Iow" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has said could be a candidate for being relaunched</u></a>.</p><p>After that, Rampal said, “there are tons of conversations around power uprates,” which is when nuclear plant operators install new equipment or alter the operation of existing plants to make them more powerful.</p><p>According to one study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Koroush Shirvan,<a href="https://osf.io/preprints/osf/ykxh4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u> uprates could increase the capacity of America’s nuclear fleet by 50%</u></a>. Actual uprates tend to be far more modest (and the paper acknowledges such dramatic uprates “are aspirational and may not be practical”). The last 10 uprates have averaged 1.6%, according to<a href="https://www.nei.org/resources/statistics/us-nuclear-plant-actual-and-expected-uprates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u> data collected by the Nuclear Energy Institute</u></a>.</p><p>“Many more nuclear plants could be more aggressive with uprates. There’s technology out there that could produce more power,” Mark Nelson, managing director at Radiant Energy Group, told me.<br/></p><p> The Loan Program Office can fund these upgrades and they will benefit from tax credits alongside other existing nuclear plants.</p><p>Microsoft is not the first technology company to get into the nuclear game, although many observers have long suspected it would. Alongside Google and Nucor, the company <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/google-microsoft-nucor-clean-energy-initiative/" target="_blank">has committed</a> to nurturing so-called clean-firm generation to help power operations on a 24/7 basis in a way that existing renewable generation cannot. The company has made<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/23/microsoft_nuclear_hires/" target="_blank"><u> several notable hires of nuclear industry veterans</u></a> in the past few years.</p><p>“There’s nowhere in the USA where you can suddenly get power needed by Microsoft while making it additional,” besides bringing new nuclear power onto the grid, Nelson told me, referring to the concept that to fully prevent carbon emissions from new corporate activity, the non-carbon-emitting energy acquired has to be <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/ai-additionality-framework" target="_blank">new to the grid</a>. “Not just 24/7, but 24/7 at one location.”</p><p>Microsoft’s nuclear deal is also the second major one inked by a technology company just this year. Amazon purchased a data center site co-located at another Pennsylvania nuclear plant in March. That plan to link up a <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/amazon-nuclear-talen-energy" target="_self">data center with the Susquehanna nuclear power plant</a> has been controversial as it is “behind-the-meter,” meaning it would be powering Amazon’s facility directly, not providing power to the grid under a power purchase agreement like Microsoft will be doing with Constellation. Some argue it would<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/talen-amazon-data-center-interconnection-agreement-nuclear-pjm-aep-exelon/720139/" target="_blank"> still shift costs</a> to others on the grid. The Amazon deal also does not provide any new clean power, it simply reallocates it to a big customer.</p><p>But there are only so many existing nuclear power plants that could uprate or recently-shut plants that could restart, but whatever new nuclear power does come online, there will likely be a technology company eager to scoop it up.</p><p>“We need to stamp out nuclear plants of designs that work now and lock in new construction,” Nelson told me. “We’re in a time of extreme scarcity.”</p>

## Probe finds 'complacency,' shortfalls contributed to Trump assassination attempt

date: 2024-09-20, from: VOA News USA

washington  — The ability of a lone gunman to fire eight shots at Donald Trump during a campaign rally in rural, western Pennsylvania was partially the result of multiple failures by the U.S. Secret Service agents charged with protecting the former president, according to a new report.


The agency’s internal investigation into the attempted assassination targeting the one-time U.S. leader and current Republican presidential candidate, released Friday, identified problems with communication and coordination ahead of the July 13 rally, as well as an over-reliance on state and local law enforcement partners.


“We cannot abdicate or defer our responsibilities to others,” acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe told reporters Friday in Washington.


“The Secret Service did not give clear guidance or direction to our local law enforcement partners,” he said. “While some members of the advance team were very diligent, there was complacency on the part of others that led to a breach of security protocols.”


The attempted assassination shook much of the U.S., and it prompted the then-director of the Secret Service to resign.


Law enforcement officials have said the attempt was carried out by 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, who acted alone and saw Trump as a target of opportunity.


Despite the presence of Trump’s protective detail, advance teams, and local law enforcement, Crooks was able to climb to the top of a building overlooking the rally and set up with an AR-style rifle before being detected.


The shots wounded Trump and two rally goers, while killing a third.




The Secret Service report focuses on what the agency is describing as “communication deficiencies” at the rally, blaming agents for failing to make sure the site and surrounding areas — including the roof of the nearby building — were properly secured.


Rowe said that while there were discussions with local law enforcement about the building in particular, there were no subsequent conversations to make sure adequate protection was in place.


“We should have been more direct,” he said. “There was an assumption that they had it covered, but there clearly was not that follow-up to make sure.”


Other problems included a failure by the Secret Service to make sure local law enforcement knew how to communicate with agents on the ground, which prevented Trump’s protective detail from learning about the search for a suspicious person.


Had the detail been aware, a decision could have been made to relocate the former president to a safer location.




Rowe told reporters that Secret Service personnel responsible for the deficiencies will be held accountable, but he denied reports that some had been asked to resign.


“This agency has among the most robust table of penalties in the entirety of the federal government, and these penalties will be administered according to our disciplinary process,” he said.


The release of the Secret Service report comes less than a week after what officials have described as a second apparent assassination attempt against former President Trump.


Sheriff’s deputies in Florida arrested 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh, stopping him on a major highway Sunday, about an hour after he fled from the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach.


Officials said data gathered from Routh’s cellphone showed he lay in wait for 12 hours, hiding in bushes along a chain-link perimeter fence between the course’s fifth and seventh holes with an SKS-style rifle.




Routh fled without firing a shot after a member of the Secret Service advance team spotted his rifle sticking out from behind the bushes and fired several shots.


The agent’s reaction “is exactly how we trained and exactly what we want our personnel to do,” Rowe said Friday. “He identified a threat, an individual with a long gun, and he made swift decisions and took a swift action to be able to mitigate that.”


Rowe also said that since the July 13 assassination attempt against Trump, the Secret Service has been providing Trump and Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris with the same level of protection as President Joe Biden.


And he said that since Trump left office, his security detail has been “more robust than prior former presidents.”


But the acting Secret Service director said the increased levels of security are coming at a cost, asking U.S. lawmakers for more funding and personnel.


“We have finite resources,” Rowe told reporters. “We are burning through a lot of assets and resources. We are stretching those resources to their maximum right now.”

## Slowly booting full Linux on the Intel 4004 for fun, art, and absolutely no profit

date: 2024-09-20, from: OS News

Can you run Linux on the Intel 4004, the first commercially produced microprocessor, released to the world in 1971? Well, Dmitry Grinberg, the genius engineer who got Linux to run on all kinds of incredibly underpowered hardware, sought to answer this very important question. In short, yes, you can run Linux on the 4004, but much as with other extremely limited and barebones chips, you have to get&#8230; Creative. Very creative. Of course, Linux cannot and will not boot on a 4004 directly. There is no C compiler targeting the 4004, nor could one be created due to the limitations of the architecture. The amount of ROM and RAM that is addressable is also simply too low. So, same as before, I would have to resort to emulation. My initial goal was to fit into 4KB of code, as that is what an unmodified unassisted 4004 can address. 4KB of code is not much at all to emulate a complete system. After studying the options, it became clear that MIPS R3000 would be the winner here. Every other architecture I considered would be harder to emulate in some way. Some architectures had arbitrarily-shifted operands all the time (ARM), some have shitty addressing modes necessitating that they would be slow (RISCV), some would need more than 4KB to even decode instructions (x86), and some were just too complex to emulate in so little space (PPC). &#8230; so &#8230; MIPS again&#8230; OK! ↫ Dmitry Grinberg This is just one very small aspect of this massive undertaking, and the article and videos accompanying his success are incredibly detailed and definitely not for the faint of heart. The amount of skill, knowledge, creativity, and persistence on display here is stunning, and many of us can only dream of being able to do stuff like this. I absolutely love it. Of course, the Linux kernel had to be slimmed down considerably, as a lot of stuff currently in the kernel are of absolutely no use on such an old system. Boot time is measured in days, still, but it helped a lot. Grinberg also turned the whole setup into what is effectively an art piece you can hang on the wall, where you can have it run and, well, do things &#8211; not much, of course, but he did include a small program that draws mandelbrot set on the VFD and serial port, which is a neat trick. He plans on offering the whole thing as a kit, but a lot of it depends on getting enough of the old chips to offer a complete, ready-to-assemble kit in the first place.

## Why Apple uses JPEG XL in the iPhone 16 and what it means for your photos

date: 2024-09-20, from: OS News

The iPhone 16 family has arrived and includes many new features, some of which Apple has played very close to its vest. One such improvement is the inclusion of JPEG XL file types, which promise improved image quality compared to standard JPEG files while delivering relatively smaller file sizes.  Overall, JPEG XL addresses many of JPEG’s shortcomings. The 30-year-old format is not very efficient, only offers eight-bit color depth, doesn’t support HDR, doesn’t do alpha transparency, doesn’t support animations, doesn’t support multiple layers, includes compression artifacts, and exhibits banding and visual noise. JPEG XL tackles these issues, and unlike WebP and AVIF formats, which each have some noteworthy benefits too, JPEG XL has been built from the ground up with still images in mind. ↫ Jeremy Gray at PetaPixel Excellent news, and it will hopefully mean others will follow &#8211; something that tends to happen when Apple finally supports to the new thing.

## A Green Steel Dust-Up Is a Warning

date: 2024-09-20, from: Heatmap News

Chief executive Lourenco Goncalves <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/13/steelmaker-biden-climate-grant-00179145" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>suggested in an interview</u></a> that the company was considering passing up $500 million of federal grants to build a new hydrogen-powered mill at its Middletown Works facility in Ohio, blaming fears that there won’t be buyers for the lower-carbon product, which he claimed could cost 40% more to produce than steel made by conventional methods. Cleveland-Cliffs later issued a short <a href="https://www.clevelandcliffs.com/news/news-releases/detail/629/cleveland-cliffs-selected-to-receive-575-million-in-us" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>press release</u></a> walking back Goncalves’s comments and reaffirming its commitment to the “transformational” project. </p><p>It’s, of course, possible that Goncalves was just expressing personal concerns that do not reflect the company’s official position. But either way, those doubts were not only real, but revealing about our prospects for decarbonization by mid-century. </p><p>First, the episode is a stark indictment of the many attempts to create demand for cleaner products by conjuring up corporate ambition on climate change. The entire rationale for cajoling corporations to quantify the emissions in their supply chains, known as Scope 3 emissions, has been to pressure them into sourcing greener inputs. The steel sector produces 7% to 9% of emissions globally: if it were a country, it would be the world’s <a href="https://cen.acs.org/environment/green-chemistry/steel-hydrogen-low-co2-startups/99/i22#:~:text=If%20the%20steel%20industry%20were,has%20a%20greater%20climate%20impact." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>third-biggest emitter </u></a>after the United States and China. And steel represents the biggest single source of Scope 3 emissions for many companies in other industries — on the order of <a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/capturing-value-by-decarbonizing-the-automotive-supply-chain/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>40% to 45% for auto compan</u></a><u>ies</u> and<a href="https://www.deloitte.com/ng/en/Industries/energy/perspectives/decarbonizing-the-steel-value-chain.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u> as high as 85%</u></a> for construction, for example. This makes steel a litmus test for whether Scope 3 footprinting and corporate commitments to green their supply chains are delivering as promised.</p><p>Worse, these types of steel buyers have ostensibly already been organized to show demand for green inputs. Before he stepped down as President Biden’s special envoy for climate, one of John Kerry’s cornerstone initiatives was the First Mover’s Coalition, an effort to secure advanced purchasing commitments from corporate buyers for green steel and other industrial materials. The fact that the coalition’s members – many of which are major steel buyers like Ford and General Motors – were not publically jumping all over the outputs of Cleveland-Cliffs’s heavily subsidized project is itself troubling. After all, while the green premium on steel may be significant, the material is typically a relatively cheap input into much more expensive, high value-added products. </p><p>Goncalves’s comments also underscore how uncomfortable incumbent industries perceive the jump to new, low-carbon products to be. Assume that the new Cleveland-Cliffs mill does in fact pencil out at the cost originally expected and that it has a reasonable prospect of finding offtakers. The company still says it has to invest $1.1 billion to complete the project. It is not really enough, in the logic of the market, for that investment to be profitable: It has to compete against the opportunity cost of alternative investments, including manufacturing conventional steel. Even if both outputs would find buyers, conventional steel may still be more profitable. </p><p>Now imagine the company is looking at the larger direction of the industry. If they don’t do this project, they may well forestall a shift to cleaner steel and be able to keep the sector chugging along more profitably for a little longer. Complete the project, and they may bring about changes that, while maybe inevitable, are uncomfortable for the industry. After all, Cleveland-Cliffs and U.S. Steel produce the vast majority of American primary steel; they <em><em>are </em></em>steel production in the United States – and so they get to shape its transformation. <br/><br/>This behavior is similar to that of the American car industry. U.S. automakers have largely conceded that electric vehicles will eventually overtake their combustion-engine counterparts, but they are still clinging to the better margins that gas-powered SUVs provide. The short-term profits are hard to pass up, even if it means getting farther behind EV first-movers like Tesla, BYD, and Hyundai. Once the technology pathway to a sector’s transition becomes clear — even when it feels inevitable — incumbents may still have an extremely hard time ripping off the bandaid. </p><p>It’s as if decarbonization is a massive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>marshmallow test</u></a> for corporate America, and it’s failing.</p><p>There are essentially two ways out of this dilemma. </p><p>The first is that society will need to rely on new entrants to each sector to disrupt the status quo. Companies developing entirely novel steelmaking technologies like <a href="https://www.bostonmetal.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Boston Metals</u></a> become more important to the steel transition than Cleveland-Cliffs, just as <a href="https://www.autoremarketing.com/ar/experian-report-shows-extent-of-teslas-domination-of-u-s-ev-market/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Tesla has been to the American EV market</u></a>. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sublime+cement&sca_esv=2f058df75e11d83a&sca_upv=1&rlz=1C1CHBD_enUS1021US1021&sxsrf=ADLYWILXGYWwag7ZViJNivASpSTqedGIEg%3A1726591089271&ei=cbDpZvOjEPas0PEPi7ufiAg&ved=0ahUKEwizoLGEtcqIAxV2FjQIHYvdB4EQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=sublime+cement&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiDnN1YmxpbWUgY2VtZW50MgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgYQABgWGB4yCxAAGIAEGIYDGIoFMgsQABiABBiGAxiKBTILEAAYgAQYhgMYigUyCBAAGIAEGKIEMggQABiABBiiBDIIEAAYgAQYogRI2AxQ4wRY0AtwAXgBkAEAmAGbAaAB9gWqAQM0LjO4AQPIAQD4AQGYAgigApYGwgIKEAAYsAMY1gQYR8ICDRAAGIAEGLADGEMYigXCAg4QABiwAxjkAhjWBNgBAcICExAuGIAEGLADGEMYyAMYigXYAQHCAhUQABiABBixAxhDGIMBGIoFGEYY-QHCAg0QLhiABBixAxhDGIoFwgINEAAYgAQYsQMYQxiKBcICChAuGIAEGEMYigXCAggQLhiABBixA8ICCBAAGIAEGLEDwgIvEAAYgAQYsQMYQxiDARiKBRhGGPkBGJcFGIwFGN0EGEYY-QEY9AMY9QMY9gPYAQHCAggQLhiABBjUAsICBRAuGIAEwgIUEC4YgAQYsQMYxwEYmAUYmQUYrwHCAiMQLhiABBjUAhiXBRjcBBjeBBjgBBj0AxjxAxj1Axj2A9gBAcICCxAAGIAEGJECGIoFwgILEC4YgAQYxwEYrwGYAwCIBgGQBhO6BgYIARABGAmSBwM1LjOgB89H&sclient=gws-wiz-serp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Sublime Systems</u></a> may be vital for green cement, just as <a href="https://fervoenergy.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Fervo Energy</u></a> may be for enhanced geothermal. The problem with this approach is that it is extremely expensive to build projects in heavy industries like steel, so most pathways assume that even technology developed outside of the incumbents will get deployed by them (Sublime just this week <a href="https://www.worldcement.com/the-americas/19092024/holcim-invests-in-sublime-systems-to-scale-up-innovative-low-carbon-technology/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced</u></a> a tie-up with cement giant Holcim). </p><p>This leads to option two: comprehensive industrial policy. Cleveland-Cliffs may want to see not only that one green project pencils out, but that strategic opportunities and risks favor going green. This might means measures like implementing a <a href="https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/democrats/2024/2/what-is-a-carbon-border-adjustment-mechanism-cbam-and-what-are-some-legislative-proposals-to-make-one" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>U.S. carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM)</u></a> to prevent foreign competitors from dumping dirty steel, the government guaranteeing offtake using public procurement programs like <a href="https://www.sustainability.gov/buyclean/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Buy Clean</u></a> and <a href="https://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ET34-Contracts-for-Difference.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Contracts for Difference</u></a>, and ultimately policy sticks like carbon pricing that send a long-term signal favoring clean products over polluting ones, instead of relying on corporate social responsibility for a demand signal.</p><p>To decarbonize the economy, we will probably have to rely both on more robust industrial policy and the sector disruption from new entrants. While the story of this Cleveland-Cliffs project is far from over, the company’s apparent hesitancy, like that of U.S. automakers, may be teaching us a lesson that we have to learn quickly if we want to see decarbonization any time soon.</p>

## Kentucky sheriff charged in killing of judge at courthouse

date: 2024-09-20, from: VOA News USA

FRANKFORT, Ky. — A judge in a rural Kentucky county was fatally shot in his courthouse chambers Thursday, and the local sheriff was charged with murder in the killing, police said.


The preliminary investigation indicates Letcher County Sheriff Shawn M. Stines shot District Judge Kevin Mullins multiple times following an argument inside the courthouse, according to Kentucky State Police. Mullins, who held the judgeship for 15 years, died at the scene, and Stines surrendered without incident.


The fatal shooting in Whitesburg sent shock waves through a tight-knit Appalachian town and county seat of government with about 1,700 residents located about 235 kilometers southeast of Lexington.




Lead county prosecutor Matt Butler described an outpouring of sympathy as he recused himself and his office from investigations in the shooting, citing social and family ties to Mullins.


“We all know each other here. ... Anyone from Letcher County would tell you that Judge Mullins and I married sisters and that we have children who are first cousins but act like siblings," Butler said in statement from his office. “For that reason, among others, I have already taken steps to recuse myself and my entire office.”


Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman said his office will collaborate with a commonwealth’s attorney in the region as special prosecutors in the criminal case.


“We will fully investigate and pursue justice,” Coleman said on social media.


Kentucky Supreme Court Chief Justice Laurance B. VanMeter said he was “shocked by this act of violence” and that the court system was “shaken by this news.”


Letcher County's judge-executive signed an order closing on Friday the county courthouse where the shooting took place.


Mullins, 54, was hit multiple times in the shooting, Kentucky State Police said. Stines, 43, was charged with one count of first-degree murder. The investigation is continuing, police said.




It was unclear whether Stines had an attorney. Kentucky State Police referred inquiries about Stines’ legal representation Thursday to a spokesperson who did not immediately respond by email.


Responding to the shooting, Governor Andy Beshear said in a social media post: “There is far too much violence in this world, and I pray there is a path to a better tomorrow.”


Mullins served as a district judge in Letcher County since he was appointed by former Gov. Steve Beshear in 2009 and elected the following year.


Mullins was known for promoting substance abuse treatment for people involved in the justice system and helped hundreds of residents enter inpatient residential treatment, according to a program for a drug summit he spoke at in 2022. He also helped develop a program called Addiction Recovery Care to offer peer support services in the courthouse. The program was adopted in at least 50 counties in Kentucky.


Mullins also served as a founding member of the Responsive Effort to Support Treatment in Opioid Recovery Efforts Leadership Team.


After the shooting, several area schools were briefly placed on lockdown.

## Three Mile Island Is Coming Back Online to Power Microsoft Data Centers

date: 2024-09-20, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzY1MjcyMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NzU1OTk0Nn0.6JkaI8zMUFAqfPbUM4nB0FJBYszL0a8DYmqfKjltLJs/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>
<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> Cleanup efforts have begun in Italy’s washed out Emilia-Romagna region • Endangered freshwater dolphins are washing ashore at Brazil’s Lake Tefe as water levels recede due to drought • The Colorado Rockies could see some snow this weekend.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Three Mile Island nuclear plant to come back online to power Microsoft data centers</h3><p>
	We’ll start with some breaking news today: Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island nuclear plant, the site of an infamous 1979 partial reactor meltdown, will be revived by 2028 as part of a plan to provide power for Microsoft’s data centers. Constellation Energy, the plant’s owner and the largest nuclear operator in the country, <a href="https://www.constellationenergy.com/newsroom/2024/Constellation-to-Launch-Crane-Clean-Energy-Center-Restoring-Jobs-and-Carbon-Free-Power-to-The-Grid.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8gHXPLaF6O7JqEKGA4_DR8YQveUNTy53gc99LgDbt-2IXSIKkjSWKCOYqrzEuvbaSEoA1M" target="_blank">announced the news today</a>. Microsoft agreed to buy all of the plant’s power for 20 years – enough energy to power 800,000 homes.
</p><p>
	If approved, this decision “would mark a bold advance in the tech industry’s quest to find enough electric power to support its boom in artificial intelligence,”<em><em> The Washington Post </em></em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/09/20/microsoft-three-mile-island-nuclear-constellation/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8gHXPLaF6O7JqEKGA4_DR8YQveUNTy53gc99LgDbt-2IXSIKkjSWKCOYqrzEuvbaSEoA1M" target="_blank">reported</a>. “The symbolism is enormous,” Joseph Dominguez, chief executive of Constellation, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/20/climate/three-mile-island-reopening.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8gHXPLaF6O7JqEKGA4_DR8YQveUNTy53gc99LgDbt-2IXSIKkjSWKCOYqrzEuvbaSEoA1M" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> <em><em>The New York Times</em></em>. “This was the site of the industry’s greatest failure, and now it can be a place of rebirth.”
</p><p>
	“Now, THIS is additional clean supply,” <a href="https://x.com/JesseJenkins/status/1837089920659165420?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8gHXPLaF6O7JqEKGA4_DR8YQveUNTy53gc99LgDbt-2IXSIKkjSWKCOYqrzEuvbaSEoA1M" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said Heatmap Shift Key co-host Jesse Jenkins</a>. “Bravo. It is remarkable to see a handful of nuclear reactors shuttered in the last decade due to poor revenues contemplating restart now. Palisades, now TMI. Who is next? Maybe it was unwise to let these plants close in the fist place eh?”
</p><h3>2. World Bank climate financing reaches record high</h3><p>
	The World Bank Group yesterday <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2024/09/19/climate-finance-fiscal-year-2024-snapshot?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8gHXPLaF6O7JqEKGA4_DR8YQveUNTy53gc99LgDbt-2IXSIKkjSWKCOYqrzEuvbaSEoA1M" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> it delivered a record $42.6 billion in climate finance in fiscal year 2024 (which ran from July to June), a 10% increase year-over-year. Climate financing made up 44% of the group’s total lending, which is awfully close to its goal, set at COP28, of 45% for fiscal year 2025. However this remains “well short of the trillions of dollars in additional resources needed annually to finance the clean energy transition in emerging markets and developing countries,” <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/world-bank-climate-finance-reaches-record-426-bln-fiscal-2024-2024-09-19/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8gHXPLaF6O7JqEKGA4_DR8YQveUNTy53gc99LgDbt-2IXSIKkjSWKCOYqrzEuvbaSEoA1M" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a> <em>Reuters</em>.
</p><h3>3. Equatic starts producing its breakthrough anode</h3><p>
<strong></strong>Carbon removal startup Equatic <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/09/19/2949051/0/en/Equatic-Unveils-Oxygen-Selective-Anodes-Unlocking-Gigaton-Scale-Carbon-Removal-and-Green-Hydrogen-Generation-With-Seawater-Electrolysis.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8gHXPLaF6O7JqEKGA4_DR8YQveUNTy53gc99LgDbt-2IXSIKkjSWKCOYqrzEuvbaSEoA1M" target="_blank">announced</a> it has started manufacturing its “oxygen-selective anode,” which has the potential to pave the way for a two-for-one climate solution: commercial hydrogen production and carbon removal. Equatic wants to use seawater electrolysis – sending an electrical current through seawater – to sequester carbon dioxide from the air in the ocean while also producing hydrogen. But as <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/equatic-carbon-removal-hydrogen?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8gHXPLaF6O7JqEKGA4_DR8YQveUNTy53gc99LgDbt-2IXSIKkjSWKCOYqrzEuvbaSEoA1M" target="_self">Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo reported</a>, electrolysis tends to turn the salt in the water into the toxic and corrosive gas chlorine, which makes commercializing such a process challenging. So Equatic set out to find the right combination of catalysts to make an anode – a sheet of conductive, positively-charged metal – that, when used in electrolysis, would screen out the salt and not allow it to react. Using ARPA-E funding, they landed on a design that produced less than one part per million of chlorine (lower than the amount in drinking water) and performed reliably for more than 20,000 hours of testing.
</p><p>
	The company’s San Francisco facility will be able to produce 4,000 of these anodes per year to start, and is expected to operate at full capacity by the end of 2024. It will produce the anodes for Equatic’s first demonstration-scale project, a new plant in Singapore designed to remove 10 metric tons of CO2 and produce 300 kilograms of hydrogen per day — 100 times larger than the pilot version. Equatic also has plans to build an even bigger plant in Quebec that can remove 300 tons per day. That’s about three times the capacity of Climeworks’ Mammoth plant, the world’s largest direct air capture plant operating today.
</p><h3>4. Outlook for Doomsday Glacier looking ‘grim’</h3><p>
	Scientists who spent six years examining the Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica warned this week that the outlook for the glacier is “grim.” Thwaites, often referred to as the “Doomsday Glacier,” is massive, spanning an area equal to the state of Florida. It has been retreating for nearly a century, but this melting has accelerated significantly over the last 30 years and the <a href="https://thwaitesglacier.org/news/grim-outlook-antarcticas-thwaites-glacier?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8gHXPLaF6O7JqEKGA4_DR8YQveUNTy53gc99LgDbt-2IXSIKkjSWKCOYqrzEuvbaSEoA1M" target="_blank">new research suggests</a> it is set to worsen. Within 200 years, the glacier could collapse, raising sea levels worldwide. <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/20/climate/doomsday-glacier-thwaites-melt-sea-level-rise/index.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8gHXPLaF6O7JqEKGA4_DR8YQveUNTy53gc99LgDbt-2IXSIKkjSWKCOYqrzEuvbaSEoA1M" target="_blank">CNN succinctly summarized why this matters</a>:
</p><p>
<em>“Thwaites holds enough water to increase sea levels by more than 2 feet. But because it also acts like a cork, holding back the vast Antarctic ice sheet, its collapse could ultimately lead to around 10 feet of sea level rise, devastating coastal communities from Miami and London to Bangladesh and the Pacific Islands.”</em>
</p><p>
	Dr. Ted Scambos, U.S. science coordinator of the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration and glaciologist at the University of Colorado, said “immediate and sustained climate intervention will have a positive effect, but a delayed one.”

</p><h3>5. WRI considers city life at 3 degrees Celsius of warming</h3><p>
	A sweeping new <a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/climate-change-effects-cities-15-vs-3-degrees-C?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8gHXPLaF6O7JqEKGA4_DR8YQveUNTy53gc99LgDbt-2IXSIKkjSWKCOYqrzEuvbaSEoA1M" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> from the World Resources Institute paints a bleak picture of what 996 of the world’s biggest cities will feel like in a world that is 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial records, and compares that to a scenario in which temperatures warm by 3 degrees Celsius. Here are some stats:
</p><ul>
<li><strong>6.4 </strong>– heat waves, on average, cities will experience each year with 3 degrees C of warming, compared to 4.9 heat waves annually at 1.5 degrees C of warming.</li>
<li><strong>24.5</strong> – average length, in days, of the year’s longest heat wave at 3 degrees C of warming, compared to 16.3 days for 1.5 degrees C of warming.</li>
<li><strong>16</strong> – percentage of big cities that would experience a heat wave that lasts for a month or longer annually at 3 degrees C of warming.</li>
<li><strong>Two-thirds </strong>– the share of the global population that will live in cities by 2050.</li>
</ul><p>
	The report also looks at what warmer temperatures mean for mosquito-borne diseases. Some, like dengue, Zika, and West Nile, will become more common. But malaria could actually decline “as temperatures in many places become warmer than what is optimal for malaria-transmitting mosquitos.”
</p><h2>THE KICKER</h2><p>

## The Big Problem With Big Electric Pickups

date: 2024-09-20, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzY0NzcxNy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MTEyNTcxM30.aGrScMaWCBiFbVQ4OWRaNSxUcnTh7oL5ZV4y9jmViuY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">It’s tough out there for an electric truck.</p>
<p>Rivian’s R1T was the showpiece that launched the company; I was blown away the moment I saw its concept version at a car show in the 2010s. But the truck’s <a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Q2-2024-Kelley-Blue-Book-Electric-Vehicle-Sales-Report.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>sales</u></a> are down 38% over last year as the R1S SUV becomes the brand’s signature vehicle. Ford has found some footing with the F-150 Lightning, but is lowering expectations for the vehicle as Detroit faces fierce headwinds trying to convince its legion of truck drivers to go electric — and <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/709472/chevy-silverado-gmc-sierra-phev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>backtracks toward plug-in hybrids</u></a>. The category leader in sales, the Tesla Cybertruck, exists primarily to inspire TikTok derision, which would be easier to swallow if its sales, while rising, didn’t pale in comparison to the Model Y and 3.</p>
<p>There are practical reasons for sluggish truck sales — the SUV shape is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/178ogdk/why_are_folks_going_with_the_r1s_over_the_r1t/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more useful</u></a> than a pickup truck for the kinds of people currently buying EVs. There are political reasons, of course. Even with Donald Trump’s softening his EV hatred thanks to support from Elon Musk, lots of pickup drivers remain electric-averse. There are financial reasons, since many of the electric truck offerings to date are staggeringly expensive. Above these concerns floats a broader, more all-consuming problem: Maybe it’s just not the right time to make an all-electric truck, at least not the monstrous kind America buys.</p>
<p>Lucid’s CEO recently <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/733271/lucid-ev-pickup-truck/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>remarked</u></a> on this idea in response to drawings of a theoretical Lucid pickup circulating on the internet. Despite America’s insatiable appetite for pickups, the company is absolutely not making a truck right now, he said.</p>
<p>His rationale boils down to the conundrum for today’s EVs: Vehicles of all stripes have been getting bigger as American drivers choose crossovers, SUVs, and trucks. Since those are the shapes Americans want, and want to pay extra for, those are the kinds of EVs carmakers want to sell. But a larger EV is a less efficient one. It takes lots of energy to move a heavy vehicle, which means they need huge batteries just to achieve a normal driving range.</p>
<p>As I <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-size" target="_self"><u>noted</u></a> earlier this month, Lucid has been counterculturally hyper-focused on making efficient vehicles that can maximize range. Its Air sedans achieve an industry-leading 4 miles per kilowatt-hour of electricity, which lets the cars claim more than 400 miles per charge despite having a battery of average size. The excellent but heavyweight R1T is only about half as efficient. You can buy one with 420 miles of range, but doing so requires an enormous and expensive battery pack.</p>
<p>Weight alone is not the only issue. Pickup owners — even those who never stray from the smooth pavement of the suburbs — want their vehicles to be able to tow a boat or tackle the Rubicon trail. Towing with an EV dings the driving range that’s already low because of the vehicle’s heft. Knowing that, Lucid CTO and CEO Peter Rawlinson estimated the minimum battery size threshold for a workable electric pickup at 150 kilowatt-hours — nearly double the size of the 84-kilowatt hour battery that powers the simplest Lucid Air, and well past the 118-kilowatt hour pack in the long range Grand Touring edition. Given the cost of today’s batteries and their physical limitations, it’s simply difficult to make the math work for the kind of megavehicle that full-size pickups have become.</p>
<p>Downsizing the truck would help, of course. It’d be much easier, and cheaper, to fully electrify something the size and weight of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_S-10" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Chevy S-10</u></a>. However, the chorus of car enthusiasts and compact truck fans calling for the pickup to return to its reasonably sized roots has been drowned out by all the money Detroit is making on monster trucks. Don’t pin your hopes there.</p>
<p>But just because the full-size EV pickup is in a tough spot now doesn’t mean it’ll stay that way. The battery calculus will change as technologies improve and economies of scale emerge. At some point, it might be possible to squeeze 150 or 200 kilowatt-hours of juice into a not-gargantuan battery pack, and to build it for less than a small fortune, at which point the fully electric F-150 or Silverado becomes a far more attractive proposition.</p>
<p>The more immediate solution, though, is the ongoing rise of the hybrid. Trucks make terrific hybrids. The hybrid version of the <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/ford/f-150" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>current Ford F-150</u></a> has plenty of power and driving range for serious work or play, and also gets 25 miles per gallon in the city compared to 18-20 mpg for combustion-only trucks. If that doesn’t sound like a lot, remember that when it comes to cutting fossil fuels consumption and emissions, improving gas-guzzlers by a little can be <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/350382/gas-mileage-fuel-economy-mpg-gphm-gas-guzzlers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more powerful</u></a> than improving already-efficient cars by a lot. (With mpg, it’s better to go from bad to decent than from good to great. It’s a bad statistic.)</p>
<p>Crucially for the potential to cut the carbon emissions of America’s truck fleet, conventional hybrids are less weighed down by a feeling of foreignness and political baggage. There was a time when vehicles like the Prius were the peak of conspicuous car consumption for lefty greens. Now a slew of vehicles, including trucks, come in hybrid configurations (and some cars, like the Toyota Camry, have <a href="https://pressroom.toyota.com/toyota-camry-goes-exclusively-hybrid-plus-a-new-look-and-more-technology/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ditched</u></a> combustion-only models altogether). A hybrid is just a car, one you can pump gas into and drive without thinking too much about the partisan implications of its powertrain. </p>
<p>The idea of plug-in hybrid full-size trucks is alluring, too. Owners could live out the fantasy of driving a weekend warrior 4x4 — and enjoy the in-group signaling that comes with pickup ownership — all while using electricity for the local driving that makes up most of their actual transportation needs. Perhaps someday we could even get <a href="https://heatmap.news/plugin-ford-maverick-electric" target="_self"><u>Heatmap’s dream vehicle</u></a>, a plug-in hybrid version of the reasonably sized Ford Maverick.</p>
<p>Trucks are good candidates for unusual hybrid configurations, too. This week, some American reviewers tested, and loved, the <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/733031/americans-review-byd-shark-pickup/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>BYD Shark</u></a>, a Chinese-made pickup on sale in Mexico but not here. The Shark’s hybrid setup is a range extender, meaning that although the gas engine can drive the front wheels in some situations, it exists primarily to charge a generator that powers electric motors, and those motors push the vehicle. Its battery pack can hold enough energy for an estimated 60 miles of electric driving.</p>
<p>The Shark won’t swim to America, given the ongoing tariffs battle. But it doesn’t have to. For 2025, Ram has promised us the Ramcharger extended-range pickup that puts this tech into a truck Americans can buy. Heatmap’s Jesse Jenkins <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/range-extender-ramcharger-1500'" target="_self"><u>called it</u></a> an “ideal near-term product to satisfy some of the trickiest American market segments to electrify: namely the uniquely American demand for full-size pickups and massive SUVs.” </p>
<p>Indeed, if truck shoppers give this new kind of electrified vehicle a chance, they’re going to like what they find.</p>

## US general: US, Chad planning return of US troops

date: 2024-09-20, from: VOA News USA

Pentagon  — The U.S. is returning Special Forces troops to Chad after leaving at the country’s request nearly five months ago.


Maj. General Kenneth Ekman, who oversaw the recent U.S. withdrawal from Niger at the request of U.S. Africa Command chief Gen. Michael Langley, told VOA in an exclusive interview Thursday that the United States and Chad have reached an understanding on the return of a limited number of Special Forces personnel.


"It was a presidential decision by [Chadian] President [Mahamat] Deby, but the decision is made, and now we're working through the specifics on how we return," he added.


In April, the U.S. pulled out some 70 Special Forces personnel from Chad ahead of the nation’s presidential election. Deby won that election and ultimately decided to allow U.S. forces to return, a decision that was only recently relayed to U.S. Africa Command.


Ekman told VOA the U.S. military plans a smaller operation than the headquarters that forces previously maintained in Chad, whose 11,000-member counterterror force is fighting a growing number of Boko Haram and Islamic State militants around Lake Chad.


"The direction of approach from Chad is immensely important," Ekman said, especially following the U.S. military withdrawal from Niger that officially ended on Sunday with his departure from Niamey. "If our presence in Niger allowed us to go inside out, relative to the Sahelian-based VEO [violent extremist organization] threat, we now have to revert to going outside in."


The head of U.S. Africa Command, General Michael Langley, has said his forces are starting to "reset and recalibrate" in the region.


Before coups in Niger, the U.S. had hundreds of forces in two bases that served as major counterterrorism hubs. Burkina Faso and Mali also hosted U.S. Special Forces teams prior to coups in their countries that strained their relationship with the United States and ultimately cut off U.S. military access to prime locations from which to monitor terror groups and train local partners.


Under U.S. law the coups prevent AFRICOM from direct military-to-military cooperation.


Now, countries such as Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Ghana, Benin and Chad will determine the U.S. counterterror strategy and force strength in West Africa.


"Each partner has their own unique security concerns. They also have their own respective tolerance and willingness to abide the presence of U.S. forces," Ekman said.


Ghana and Nigeria have made it clear to the U.S. that they are not interested in hosting U.S. forces, according to Ekman.


But as the violent militant threat spreads primarily southwest from the Sahel, some West African nations along the coast are asking for more U.S. capabilities. Even before the coup in Niger, the U.S. started refurbishing an airfield in Benin to accommodate U.S. military aircraft.


After the coup in Niger, the U.S. moved Special Forces into Ivory Coast as well, Ekman told VOA. Any decision to establish a larger military presence like the one the U.S. built up in Niger will ultimately be a policy decision.


"I don’t think you’re going to see another Air Base 201," said a senior U.S. military official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing negotiations, referring to the $100 million drone base that the U.S. built in the Nigerien desert.


Instead, the U.S. will likely try to work from within partner force garrisons through strengthening base fortifications and capabilities, but the U.S. has not made this type of agreement with any West African partners since the withdrawal from Niger.


"We're not there yet," Ekman said.


Diminished access


Since U.S. counterterror operations were halted in Niger, Ekman cautions that the region has become "more opaque" as U.S. partnerships and access have "diminished." It is more difficult to monitor the terror threat in West Africa, which hurts the U.S. ability to counter it.


Officials admit the U.S. is now "soul searching," its confidence shaken from broken partnerships and regional approaches that have failed to tamp down the terrorists.


The U.S military has been tasked with "treating the symptom: terrorism," the senior military official said, acknowledging that diplomatic and economic approaches are what is needed to counter terrorism’s root causes on the continent.


The U.S. military’s withdrawal appears to be a net loss for Niger, the United States and other regional partners who had benefited from U.S. intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities available through its bases in Niger.


Since the July 2023 coup, extremist attacks have become more lethal as Niger has lost resources and partners.


"They’re absolutely feeling [those losses]," the senior military official said.


Ekman said he believes that the U.S. and Niger’s shared security objectives will continue to link the two nations even without American forces on the ground.


"How we will pursue [those objectives], either together or apart, as a consequence of the withdrawal remains to be seen, but we wanted to make sure we kept all options on the table," he said.


Editor’s Note: After VOA published its report early Friday, U.S. AFRICOM clarified in an email that while Maj. General Ekman used the word “agreement” when speaking to VOA about U.S. special forces returning to Chad, he meant it in the “context that an understanding for our presence was established post the President’s request.” VOA has updated the story to reflect this additional information.

<i style="font-size: 0.9em;">Sample language model responses to different varieties of English and native speaker reactions.</i>
</p>

<p>ChatGPT does amazingly well at communicating with people in English. But whose English?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.similarweb.com/website/chat.openai.com/#geography">Only 15%</a> of ChatGPT users are from the US, where Standard American English is the default. But the model is also commonly used in countries and communities where people speak other varieties of English. Over 1 billion people around the world speak varieties such as Indian English, Nigerian English, Irish English, and African-American English.</p>

<p>Speakers of these non-“standard” varieties often face discrimination in the real world. They’ve been told that the way they speak is <a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/3587696">unprofessional</a> or <a href="https://doi.org/10.4324/9781410616180">incorrect</a>, <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/641206/summary">discredited as witnesses</a>, and <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780203986615-17/linguistic-profiling-john-baugh">denied housing</a>–despite <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Language-Society-and-Power-An-Introduction/Mooney-Evans/p/book/9780367638443">extensive</a> <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=QRFIsGWZ5O4C">research</a> indicating that all language varieties are equally complex and legitimate. Discriminating against the way someone speaks is often a proxy for discriminating against their race, ethnicity, or nationality. What if ChatGPT exacerbates this discrimination?</p>

<p>To answer this question, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08818">our recent paper</a> examines how ChatGPT’s behavior changes in response to text in different varieties of English. We found that ChatGPT responses exhibit consistent and pervasive biases against non-“standard” varieties, including increased stereotyping and demeaning content, poorer comprehension, and condescending responses.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="our-study">Our Study</h2>

<p>We prompted both GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 with text in ten varieties of English: two “standard” varieties, Standard American English (SAE) and Standard British English (SBE); and eight non-“standard” varieties, African-American, Indian, Irish, Jamaican, Kenyan, Nigerian, Scottish, and Singaporean English. Then, we compared the language model responses to the “standard” varieties and the non-“standard” varieties.</p>

<p>First, we wanted to know whether linguistic features of a variety that are present in the prompt would be retained in GPT-3.5 Turbo responses to that prompt. We annotated the prompts and model responses for linguistic features of each variety and whether they used American or British spelling (e.g., “colour” or “practise”). This helps us understand when ChatGPT imitates or doesn’t imitate a variety, and what factors might influence the degree of imitation.</p>

<p>Then, we had native speakers of each of the varieties rate model responses for different qualities, both positive (like warmth, comprehension, and naturalness) and negative (like stereotyping, demeaning content, or condescension). Here, we included the original GPT-3.5 responses, plus responses from GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 where the models were told to imitate the style of the input.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>We expected ChatGPT to produce Standard American English by default: the model was developed in the US, and Standard American English is likely the best-represented variety in its training data. We indeed found that model responses retain features of SAE far more than any non-“standard” dialect (by a margin of over 60%). But surprisingly, the model <em>does</em> imitate other varieties of English, though not consistently. In fact, it imitates varieties with more speakers (such as Nigerian and Indian English) more often than varieties with fewer speakers (such as Jamaican English). That suggests that the training data composition influences responses to non-“standard” dialects.</p>

<p>ChatGPT also defaults to American conventions in ways that could frustrate non-American users. For example, model responses to inputs with British spelling (the default in most non-US countries) almost universally revert to American spelling. That’s a substantial fraction of ChatGPT’s userbase likely hindered by ChatGPT’s refusal to accommodate local writing conventions.</p>

<p><strong>Model responses are consistently biased against non-“standard” varieties.</strong> Default GPT-3.5 responses to non-“standard” varieties consistently exhibit a range of issues: stereotyping (19% worse than for “standard” varieties), demeaning content (25% worse), lack of comprehension (9% worse), and condescending responses (15% worse).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/linguistic-bias/image2.png" width="90%" />
<br />
<i>Native speaker ratings of model responses. Responses to non-”standard” varieties (blue) were rated as worse than responses to “standard” varieties (orange) in terms of stereotyping (19% worse), demeaning content (25% worse), comprehension (9% worse), naturalness (8% worse), and condescension (15% worse).</i>
</p>

<p>When GPT-3.5 is prompted to imitate the input dialect, the responses exacerbate stereotyping content (9% worse) and lack of comprehension (6% worse). GPT-4 is a newer, more powerful model than GPT-3.5, so we’d hope that it would improve over GPT-3.5. But although GPT-4 responses imitating the input improve on GPT-3.5 in terms of warmth, comprehension, and friendliness, they exacerbate stereotyping (14% worse than GPT-3.5 for minoritized varieties). That suggests that larger, newer models don’t automatically solve dialect discrimination: in fact, they might make it worse.</p>

<h2 id="implications">Implications</h2>

<p>ChatGPT can perpetuate linguistic discrimination toward speakers of non-“standard” varieties. If these users have trouble getting ChatGPT to understand them, it’s harder for them to use these tools. That can reinforce barriers against speakers of non-“standard” varieties as AI models become increasingly used in daily life.</p>

<p>Moreover, stereotyping and demeaning responses perpetuate ideas that speakers of non-“standard” varieties speak less correctly and are less deserving of respect. As language model usage increases globally, these tools risk reinforcing power dynamics and amplifying inequalities that harm minoritized language communities.</p>

## VOA EXCLUSIVE: US general explains US movements, partnerships in West Africa

date: 2024-09-20, from: VOA News USA

PENTAGON — On Sunday, U.S. Africa Command’s Major General Kenneth Ekman was one of the last two U.S. service members to leave Niger as part of America’s military withdrawal, following the country’s July 2023 coup. Per an agreement reached by the U.S. and Niger in May, the only American service members that remain in the country are those securing the U.S. Embassy in the capital, Niamey.


The general, who served as AFRICOM’s director of strategy, plans and programs before focusing solely on West Africa, spent the last few months methodically overseeing the withdrawal of about 1,100 American service members, along with U.S. weapons, drones and equipment that had been staged for years in two U.S. military bases in Niger. The task was completed on time and within the parameters set by the host nation, but the withdrawal has created a massive hole in the United States’ ability to monitor the growing violent extremist threat.


In an exclusive interview at the Pentagon on Thursday, Ekman explained how the new U.S. footprint in West Africa is beginning to take shape to continue fighting a shared threat.


Below are highlights from his discussion with VOA Pentagon correspondent Carla Babb, edited for brevity and clarity:


VOA: On what Nigeriens should expect in terms of a partnership with the US military:


Major General Kenneth Ekman: I think that remains to be seen. ... I think the starting impetus will be reflecting on the 15 years of very mutually beneficial partnership that we had up to this point. We have shed blood together, right? We have pursued their most acute security threats together, and so you can't erase that history … It would be really helpful if the Nigeriens took the first step -- they asked us to leave after all -- their first step on what that government and the military that serves them would like next in a U.S. security partnership. And then it will be bounded. What I mean by that is, it's going to take a while for it ever to be what it was on July 25, 2023, which was the day prior to the coup.


There are some obstacles--everything from the request that we withdraw, to our turnover of bases and facilities and equipment, to the fact that coup sanctions, Section 7008 sanctions, have been imposed against the junta. And so all of that combines to limit the "what next."


We still have shared security objectives. How we will pursue them, either together or apart, as a consequence of the withdrawal remains to be seen, but we wanted to make sure we kept all options on the table.


VOA:  On repercussions concerning military partnerships and training exercises with countries who’ve undergone a coup:


Ekman: There are absolutely repercussions. Because when they're omitted, they lose everything from the chance to interact in a region that's becoming increasingly dis-integrated, right, to the chance to practice and practice at a high level within the context or the scenario of the exercise. So it is a net loss, right? It's a net loss for the region, and it's a loss for each of those individual countries as they are excluded.


VOA: On increased U.S. military presence in other West African nations:


Ekman: What you're talking about is that layer of forces, most of which came from Niger, that we reposition around the Sahel. If our presence in Niger allowed us to go inside out, relative to the Sahelian based VEO (violent extremist organization) threat, we now have to revert to going outside in … Countries like Cote d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast), Ghana, Benin, Chad, our access to them and the degree to which they want to partner with us will influence how we go outside in.


We're at a different phase with each of those countries. What I mean is, each partner has their own unique security concerns. They also have their own respective tolerance and willingness to abide the presence of U.S. forces. So in some cases, we moved some forces well prior to the Niger coup, because that's where the threat was going. We were invited early on, and whether it was a small SOF (special operations forces) team or an ISR (intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance) platform, we moved them months ago. The larger question is, and it's a policy question, where, and if we establish significant presence of forces, probably on a partner base, serving alongside them, doing everything from command and control to projecting things like ISR and personnel recovery, to sustaining them and to medically treating them. That is something where we're not there yet, and no agreements have been made.


There are some cases where, for now, we're definitely not (establishing a significant force presence). So that's true in Nigeria. We have a very clear message from them … Likewise in Ghana.


The ones where things are still kind of under consideration, Chad, Cote d’Ivoire, Benin, those were, what we want to do is, within the partners’ needs, support their partner-led, U.S.-enabled counter VEO ops.


VOA: On U.S. military movements, specifically, refurbishing an airfield in Benin to accommodate U.S. aircraft, sending special forces to Ivory Coast and bringing U.S. forces back to Chad:


Ekman: The most lethal violent extremist organization threat in the world resides in West Africa, and it resides in the Sahel. It's also spreading. The primary direction of travel is to the southwest, so well-prior to the Niger coup we were already working with partners on what they needed with regards to U.S. presence and capabilities. In the Benin case, we started that a while ago. In the Cote d'Ivoire case, it's been really post-coup (in Niger). So each of them is on their own timeline as we work with them… We did have some forces in Mali and Burkina Faso. We had special forces teams there as well. And given our current relationship, that's just not something that we can do, and so we had some forces available who needed to move and there were requirements in other countries. The specifics beyond that kind of remain to be seen.


VOA: But the Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast) case, the (U.S.) special forces were moved from Niger to there?


Ekman: That's correct.


VOA: OK, and then the airfield (refurbishment) in Benin (to accommodate U.S. aircraft) was started a little prior, but then also worked on during.


Ekman: That’s it.


A consistent request that we receive from all partners is intel sharing, right? And so that's something that we can offer uniquely… It is a common currency from which everyone benefits.


VOA: That has diminished.


Ekman: The region has become more opaque. Absolutely.


We did remove about 70 U.S. Special Forces personnel (from Chad) at the end of April. That was at their request. They asked us to leave. An election was coming and we obliged. That's what partners do. Since then, they had a successful election on May 6. And so in the aftermath of that, they've started asking us, well, what can we do together?


Our goal is to do something less than we had there before. We had a headquarters there before, but we have reached an agreement on the return of a limited number of special forces personnel. It is a presidential decision. So these are big policy decisions. It was a presidential decision by President Deby, but the decision is made, and now we're working through the specifics on how we return… His decision was conveyed to us in just recent weeks. Chad is really important because… it’s an outside-in strategy. And the direction of approach from Chad is immensely important. They've also been a significant contributor to Sahelian security.


VOA: On the effect that losing Niger has on region counterterrorism efforts:


Ekman: If there was one country that was most important on our ability to address Sahelian VEO problems or the Sahelian VEO challenge, it was Niger. So, for one, of Niger, I talked about it as a strategic setback, (but) the degree to which that setback endures ties to how we reposition and then what our partners want to do with us… That is a snapshot in time. All is not lost.


VOA: On concerns that Niger could fall to violent extremist organizations:


Ekman: Their risks have definitely gone up. Their ability to confront extremist organizations, intel sharing, partnership with our and other allied forces, it's gotten worse. So they are a capable force... the degree to which they can handle the problem themselves remains to be seen. It is a fact that in Niger, violent extremist attacks have become more lethal. That's a fact. Since the coup on July 26, 2023. They've got fewer resources and fewer partners.


VOA: Have you seen any evidence, or heard anything from your engagements about JNIM starting to collaborate with some of the ISIS elements (in West Africa)?


Ekman: I think that one varies. For what I can talk about in here, some cases they collaborate, some cases they compete, and that often manifest down to the local level.


VOA: On Russia’s military presence in Niger:


Ekman: In the Nigerien case, that presence is actually quite small. The Nigeriens signed a memorandum of understanding with Russia related to security cooperation two governments ago. And so they fly Russian equipment. They drive Russian equipment. There's nothing new there. The Russian trainers who showed up? Didn't see much of them while we were there. And so, to date, Russian presence in Niger has been quite limited… We caution them of the malign impacts of partnering, particularly with Russian PMCs who have yet to help anybody from a security perspective. And then their methods are abhorrent to us, OK? And so that's where we, we encourage them to draw the line.


VOA: On whether terrorists in the Sahel now have the capacity to try external operations:


Ekman: Given the lack of access that we have, given the lack of ISR, our ability to gage… the trend in their development of capability and will, it's become more difficult.


Our access and our partnerships have diminished. It's a tough operational problem.

## Board approves more non-lethal weapons for UCLA police after Israel-Hamas war protests

date: 2024-09-20, from: VOA News USA

LOS ANGELES — The University of California board of regents approved Thursday additional non-lethal weapons requested by UCLA police, which handled some of the nation's largest student protests against the Israel-Hamas war.


Clashes between protestors and counter-protestors earlier this year on the campus led to more than a dozen injuries, and more than 200 people were arrested at a demonstration the next day.


The equipment UCLA police requested and the board approved included pepper balls and sponge rounds, projectile launchers and new drones. The board also signed off on equipment purchase requests for the nine other police departments on UC campuses.


Student protesters at the regents meeting were cleared from the room after yelling broke out when the agenda item was presented.


Faculty and students have criticized UCLA police for their use of non-lethal weapons in campus demonstrations, during which some protesters suffered injuries.


During public comment, UCLA student association representative Tommy Contreras said the equipment was used against peaceful protestors and demonstrators.


"I am outraged that the University of California is prioritizing funding for military equipment while slashing resources for education," Contreras said. "Students, staff and faculty have been hurt by this very equipment used not for safety but to suppress voices."


California law enforcement agencies are required by state law to submit an annual report on the acquisition and use of weapons characterized as "military equipment." A UC spokesperson called it a "routine" agenda item not related to any particular incidents.


"The University's use of this equipment provides UC police officers with non-lethal alternatives to standard-issue firearms, enabling them to de-escalate situations and respond without the use of deadly force," spokesperson Stett Holbrook said.


Many of the requests are replacements for training equipment, and the drones are for assisting with search and rescue missions, according to Holbrook. The equipment is "not military surplus, nor is it military-grade or designed for military use," Holbrook said.


UCLA police are requesting 3,000 more pepper balls to add to their inventory of 1,600; 400 more sponge and foam rounds to their inventory of 200; eight more "less lethal" projectile launchers; and three new drones.


The report to the regents said there were no complaints or violations of policy found related to the use of the military equipment in 2023.


History professor Robin D.G. Kelley said he spent an evening with a student in the emergency room after the student was shot in the chest during a June 11 demonstration.


"The trauma center was so concerned about the condition of his heart that they kept him overnight to the next afternoon after running two echocardiograms," Kelley said the day after the student was injured. "The student was very traumatized."


UC's systemwide director of community safety Jody Stiger told the board the weapons were not to be used for crowd control or peaceful protests but "life-threatening circumstances" or violent protests where "campus leadership have deemed the need for law enforcement to utilize force to defend themselves or others."

## White House reports drop in border encounters, credits executive actions

date: 2024-09-20, from: VOA News USA

washington — The White House this week reported a significant decrease in migrant encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border since President Joe Biden issued an executive order aimed at bolstering immigration enforcement.  


Migrant encounters in August were significantly lower than last year, White House spokesperson Angelo Fernández Hernández wrote in a statement Monday. Since Biden's June 4 executive order there has been a 50% drop in encounters at the border.   




According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, in August there were about 58,000 migrant encounters between ports of entry along the southern border, nearly a 68% decline from the 181,000 in August 2023. 


The total number of southern border encounters was about 63,000. That figure includes about 5,000 migrants who came to ports of entry without a CBP One registration. 


CBP One is a mobile app that allows migrants to schedule appointments at ports of entry rather than cross illegally. U.S. border officials said the app has played a crucial role in streamlining border processes. In August, about 44,700 individuals were processed using CBP One. Since its introduction in January 2023, more than 813,000 people have scheduled appointments. 


U.S. border officials also said the June executive actions led to an increase in migrant removals, with more than 131,000 people deported to over 140 countries since June. About 400 international repatriation flights have taken place during this time.  


But even with the latest numbers, some Republican lawmakers criticized the Biden administration during a hearing Thursday to discuss potential terrorist threats and homeland security issues related to illegal immigration. 


The lawmakers argued that the perception of border officers as welcoming, rather than focused on law enforcement, is contributing to the number of migrants coming to the U.S. 


"Our border patrol, law enforcement agents were transitioned from their national security role, their law enforcement role [of] repelling illegal entry and capturing those that crossed illegally as much as possible to transition to sort of reception roles and caring for and transporting, feeding, etc.," Congressman Clay Higgins, a Republican from Alabama, said as he expressed concern about migrants who crossed illegally and evaded Border Patrol. 




There is no indication the Biden administration officially changed border patrol officers' law enforcement role. 


Alex Nowrasteh, the vice president for economic and social policy studies at the Cato Institute, testified during the hearing that the primary reason migrants come the U.S. — legally or illegally — is to work. 


"It's still the economy. That's what's pulling people in, and the rapid economic recovery after COVID can explain more than any other factor," he said.
