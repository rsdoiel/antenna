Plus, we&#8217;ll hear how the economy of Necoclí, Colombia, has shifted to serve migrants stopping there.</p>

## Google now offers ‘web’ search — and an “AI” opt-out button

The optional setting filters out almost all the other blocks of content that Google crams into a search results page, leaving you with links and text — and Google confirms to The Verge that it will block the company’s new AI Overviews as well. ↫ Sean Hollister at The Verge I hate what the web has become.

It&#8217;s designed to measure inflation but ignores one of the biggest categories of price increases hitting consumers: the cost of borrowing money. We&#8217;ll unpack why that&#8217;s the case. Also, a bipartisan group of Senators wants the federal government to spend $30 billion to address artificial intelligence development.

## Last Summer Was the Hottest in 2,000 Years

date: 2024-05-15, from: Heatmap News

<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> Wildfires continue to burn out of control in western Canada • An early season heat wave will bring record high temperatures to parts of Florida • <a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/newsroom/news/climate-health-risks-posed-by-floods?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_HTL0qv80xu6z2-aufQIIU9RvuHVrUZ9AF_X3pGd_w-k_JwBEOdLEUVyIeavPlnEjCzpGJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">One in eight</a> Europeans now live in an area at risk of flooding. </em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Study: Last summer was the hottest in 2,000 years </h3><p>
	We already know that last summer was the hottest “on record” – but those records only really go back to the 1850s or so. A new <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07512-y?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_HTL0qv80xu6z2-aufQIIU9RvuHVrUZ9AF_X3pGd_w-k_JwBEOdLEUVyIeavPlnEjCzpGJ#:~:text=Here%2C%20we%20combine%20observed%20and,than%20half%20a%20degree%20Celsius" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> published in the journal <em>Nature</em> looks further into the past and concludes that last summer was the warmest in some 2,000 years in the Northern Hemisphere. To reach this conclusion, researchers examined thousands of tree rings, which <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/how-can-tree-rings-teach-us-about-climate?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_HTL0qv80xu6z2-aufQIIU9RvuHVrUZ9AF_X3pGd_w-k_JwBEOdLEUVyIeavPlnEjCzpGJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">offer clues</a> about a year’s temperature and moisture levels. The tree ring data suggests last summer was about 4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the average temperature of the years 1 AD to 1890 AD. The study warns that summer 2024 could be even warmer than 2023.
</p><p>
	A separate <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/climate-change-made-the-deadly-heatwaves-that-hit-millions-of-highly-vulnerable-people-across-asia-more-frequent-and-extreme?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_HTL0qv80xu6z2-aufQIIU9RvuHVrUZ9AF_X3pGd_w-k_JwBEOdLEUVyIeavPlnEjCzpGJ" target="_blank">study</a> out yesterday concluded that Southeast Asia’s intense April heat wave was fueled by man-caused climate change. In the Philippines, for example, a 15-day heat wave pushed the heat index to 113 degrees Fahrenheit, disrupting daily life and forcing many schools to close. This extreme weather would have been “impossible” without climate change, the study found.
</p><h3>2. House Democrats launch probe into Trump’s meeting with Big Oil execs</h3><p>
	House Democrats have launched an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/05/14/trump-oil-executives-investigation-democrats/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_HTL0qv80xu6z2-aufQIIU9RvuHVrUZ9AF_X3pGd_w-k_JwBEOdLEUVyIeavPlnEjCzpGJ" target="_blank">investigation</a> into a recent Mar-a-Lago dinner where former President Donald Trump reportedly asked Big Oil bosses to put $1 billion toward his 2024 presidential campaign and promised to roll back some environmental rules should he win back the White House. The House oversight committee sent letters to oil executives from Cheniere Energy, Chesapeake Energy, Chevron, Continental Resources, EQT Corporation, ExxonMobil, Occidental Petroleum, Venture Global and the American Petroleum Institute. They want the companies to list who attended the meeting, provide copies of any documents distributed, describe any policies that were discussed, and disclose any contributions made to Trump’s campaign during or after the dinner, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/05/14/trump-oil-executives-investigation-democrats/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_HTL0qv80xu6z2-aufQIIU9RvuHVrUZ9AF_X3pGd_w-k_JwBEOdLEUVyIeavPlnEjCzpGJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> <em><em>The Washington Post</em></em>. The top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin, gave the executives a deadline of May 27 to turn over information, but the committee’s investigative powers are limited by the GOP’s control of the House. “If the oil companies decline to turn over the information, Democrats will not be able to subpoena the firms, stymying their investigation,” explained the <em><em>Post</em></em>.
</p><h3>3. Trump chides Biden on new Chinese EV tariffs</h3><p>
	President Biden confirmed yesterday that he is imposing a 100% tariff on Chinese-made electric vehicles, as well as tariff increases on other clean energy technologies including lithium batteries, solar cells, and critical minerals. Former President Trump, speaking from outside the New York courtroom where his hush money trial is taking place, <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/trump-trashes-tariffs-outside-manhattan-trial/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_HTL0qv80xu6z2-aufQIIU9RvuHVrUZ9AF_X3pGd_w-k_JwBEOdLEUVyIeavPlnEjCzpGJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>: “Where have they been for three-and-a-half years? They should have done it a long time ago.”
</p><p>
	There is no equivalence between Biden’ tariffs and the 10% across the board tariff on all imported goods from all countries that Trump has proposed, <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/china-tariffs-biden-evs?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_HTL0qv80xu6z2-aufQIIU9RvuHVrUZ9AF_X3pGd_w-k_JwBEOdLEUVyIeavPlnEjCzpGJ" rel="noopener" target="_self">wrote Heatmap’s Robinson Meyer</a>. “Biden’s new tariffs focus on certain strategic sectors that American officials believe the country must cultivate to stay at the technological frontier, coupled with pre-existing subsidies meant to spur domestic production of those goods. Some of the tariffs only kick in beginning in 2026 — far enough in the future, policymakers hope, for the market to prepare. Trump’s tariffs, meanwhile, would intentionally and chaotically hike prices.”

	The Department of Energy yesterday <a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/lpo-announces-conditional-commitment-plug-power-produce-and-liquify-clean-hydrogen?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_HTL0qv80xu6z2-aufQIIU9RvuHVrUZ9AF_X3pGd_w-k_JwBEOdLEUVyIeavPlnEjCzpGJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">offered</a> Plug Power a conditional commitment of $1.66 billion in loan guarantees to build up to six clean hydrogen plants that use the company’s electrolyzer technology. The hydrogen would “power fuel cell-electric vehicles used in the material handling, transportation, and industrial sectors, resulting in an estimated 84% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional hydrogen production,” the DOE announcement said. Most hydrogen production uses fossil fuels to run an electrolyzer that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. But clean hydrogen relies on electrolyzers powered by renewable sources – or natural gas with carbon capture. The Biden administration sees clean hydrogen as a key part of its push to decarbonize heavy industry. The deal isn’t done yet – Plug will have to prove its projects will benefit local communities and “satisfy certain technical, legal, environmental, and financial conditions” before the loan goes ahead. But the news sent Plug’s stock <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-14/plug-power-surges-after-biden-offers-1-7-billion-in-financing?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_HTL0qv80xu6z2-aufQIIU9RvuHVrUZ9AF_X3pGd_w-k_JwBEOdLEUVyIeavPlnEjCzpGJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">soaring</a> nonetheless.
</p><h3>5. California officials pause solar geoengineering study over safety concerns</h3><p>
	In case you missed it earlier this week (I did!), officials in California have ordered researchers to stop using an aerosol sprayer to test a potential solar geoengineering process for cooling the planet, <em><em>The New York Times</em></em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/13/climate/cloud-brightening-geoengineering.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_HTL0qv80xu6z2-aufQIIU9RvuHVrUZ9AF_X3pGd_w-k_JwBEOdLEUVyIeavPlnEjCzpGJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>. The Cloud Aerosol Research Instrument, or CARI, sits on the flight deck of the Hornet, a decommissioned aircraft carrier in Alameda, California. It sprays sea salt aerosol particles into the air, a process that could one day be used to brighten clouds and reflect the sun’s rays. This experiment, which began in early April, marked the first time such a device had been tested outdoors in the U.S. But the city of Alameda told the scientists to stop their research until the health and environmental impacts of the experiment can be evaluated. “The city is evaluating the chemical compounds in the spray to determine if they are a hazard either inhaled in aerosol form by humans and animals, or landing on the ground or in the bay,” city officials said.
</p><h2>THE KICKER</h2><p>

## Miniature poodle Sage fetches top prize at Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show

date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — A sprightly miniature poodle named Sage was crowned "Best in Show" on Tuesday at the 148th annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, winning the grand prize in the most prestigious competition among pure-bred canines in the United States.


Sage, the finalist representing 21 breeds classified as non-sporting dogs, triumphed over more than 2,500 top-ranked dogs competing in the two-day contest, held at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in the Queens borough of New York City.




Sage, a 4-year-old black-colored female groomed in the fine, fluffy topiary style traditional for poodles, competed head to head against the winners in six other groups — terriers, hounds, herding dogs, working dogs, sporting dogs and toy dogs.


She was the first female to win the top prize at Westminster since 2020, according to commentators on the Fox Sports channel, which broadcast the event live.


And she became the fourth miniature poodle to claim the top prize in the 148-year history of the contest, with the trophy previously going to her breed in 1943, 1959 and 2002, according to kennel club records.


The larger "standard" poodle breed has been declared Best in Show five times, most recently in 2020, and the smaller "toy" poodle breed has won twice.


The poodle originated as a hunting dog in Germany and is now recognized as the national dog of France.




Sage's handler, Kaz Hosaka, cried tears of joy and carried his prized poodle in his arms around floor of the auditorium to cheers of the crowd as he celebrated what he said was his 45th year participating at the Westminster dog show and the last of his career.


The Westminster dog show bills itself as the second-oldest U.S. sporting event, behind only the Kentucky Derby thoroughbred horse race. This year's competition drew a field of contenders representing 200 breeds from all 50 U.S. states and 12 other countries.




Mercedes, a female 4-year-old German shepherd, was named runner-up for the overall contest, after first winning the top prize in the herding dog group.


Along with Sage and Mercedes, the two other finalists chosen on Monday were Comet the Shih Tzu, representing the toy group, and Louis, the Afghan hound leading the hound group.


Rounding out the finalists were three group winners chosen on Tuesday - Micah the black cocker spaniel, representing sporting dogs; Monty, the giant schnauzer, leading the working dogs; and Frankie, a colored bull terrier from the terrier group.

## It Was a Big Week for the Power Grid

date: 2024-05-15, from: Heatmap News

	Transmission has been one of the biggest obstacles of decarbonizing the power grid in America. In the past week, however, the country has taken two big steps toward finally removing it.
</p><p>
	Last week, the Department of Energy published a list of 10 high-priority areas for grid development, called National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors, designed to help accelerate some of the most annoying aspects of the siting process. Then on Monday, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission passed a new rule directing grid planners to take a longer view on what America’s future electricity needs will look like.
</p><p>
	On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob and Jesse talk with two special guests — <a href="https://www.energy.gov/gdo/person/maria-robinson" target="_blank">Maria Robinson</a>, who leads the Energy Department’s Grid Deployment Office, and Heatmap reporter <a href="https://heatmap.news/u/matthewzeitlin" target="_blank">Matthew Zeitlin</a> — about what these measures mean for the Biden administration’s climate policy and how soon we might see new power lines get built. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a professor of energy systems engineering at Princeton University.

	Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p><blockquote>
<strong>Robinson Meyer:</strong> Wow. Okay. So basically, any — so can I just back up for a second? I think, first of all, I just want to go: Wow. So all of, the whole power we’re talking about today is very important. There’s nothing else like it in the federal government. But also, you’re going to have to do a whole NEPA process on it?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Maria Robinson:</strong> Yes, so we’re going to have to do a whole NEPA process for each one of these areas that we’re designating for NIETCs. And then the other part of this is that if they access some funding, they’re going to have to do another NEPA process. And if they access backstop siting at a FERC, you may have to do another NEPA process. And I know Congress is investigating a couple of remedies to that.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins:</strong> So that’s pretty important. Because the goal here is to try to accelerate the development of transmission, which is critical to tap into the best wind and solar resources across the country that can help lower electricity costs and help decarbonize the grid to meet the growing need for electricity. That’s coming from data centers, as listeners have heard here on Shift Key, from electrification of vehicles, hydrogen production, etc. So we’ve got a big pressure to increase the electricity supply in the country. And, you know, the cheapest resources are renewables, but we’ve got to be able to plug them into the grid.<br/>
<br/>
	So if this process is going to ... designating these NIETCs and then ultimately getting transmission lines built out within them, with access to federal support for financing and backstop siting authority, is going to play out over a multi-year NEPA process — or several of them — how quickly could we realistically expect to start seeing transmission lines built within some of these corridors?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Maria Robinson:</strong> What’s great about the cohort — and this is just our very first cohort of those named national transmission corridors. We anticipate that we’ll open up applications again, maybe as soon as this fall, for another round, as well, depending on how many we move forward with to do full NEPA on. It really depends on our ability to get all of that NEPA done. <br/>
<br/>
	But some of these are really ready for prime time. Some of them are just looking for some additional financing. And are looking at construction dates as soon as, say, 2028, 2029, which in the grand scheme of things for transmission is relatively soon.

## Office Hours: A convicted criminal for president?

date: 2024-05-15, from: Robert Reich on Substack

Friends, In a few weeks, Donald Trump may be a convicted criminal. It&#8217;s hardly a sure thing, of course. All he needs for a mistrial is one holdout juror. But the evidence so far seems overwhelming and damning. So we have to face a daunting reality. For the first time in history, a convicted criminal may be the nominee of one of our major parties and on November&#8217;s presidential ballot.

Today the White House announced tariffs on certain products imported from China, including steel and aluminum products, semiconductors, electric vehicles, batteries and battery components, solar cells, ship-to-shore cranes, syringes and needles, and certain personal protective equipment (or PPE). According to the White House, these higher tariffs are designed &#8220;to protect American workers and businesses from China&#8217;s unfair trade practices.&#8221; Tariffs are essentially taxes on imported goods, and altogether the tariff hikes cover about $18 billion in imported goods.

## Administration sending $1 billion more in weapons to Israel, sources say

date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Biden administration has told key lawmakers it is sending a new package of more than $1 billion in arms and ammunition to Israel, three congressional aides said Tuesday.


It's the first arms shipment to Israel to be announced by the administration since it put another arms transfer — consisting of 3,500 bombs — on hold this month. The administration has said it paused that earlier transfer to keep Israel from using the bombs in its growing offensive in the crowded southern Gaza city of Rafah.


The White House has come under criticism from both sides of the political spectrum in the U.S. over its military support for Israel's now seven-month war against Hamas in Gaza. Some of President Joe Biden's fellow Democrats have pushed him to limit transfers of offensive weapons to Israel to pressure the U.S. ally to do more to protect Palestinian civilians. Many Republicans condemn any lessening of military backing to Israel.


The package being sent includes about $700 million for tank ammunition, $500 million in tactical vehicles and $60 million in mortar rounds, the congressional aides said. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an arms transfer that has not yet been made public.


There was no immediate indication when the arms would be sent. It's not clear if this shipment is part of the long-delayed foreign aid package that Congress passed and Biden signed last month, a tranche from existing arms sale or a new sale.


The Wall Street Journal first reported the plans to move the package.


House Republicans were planning this week to advance a bill to mandate the delivery of offensive weaponry for Israel. Following Biden's move to put a pause on bomb shipments last week, Republicans have been swift in their condemnation, arguing it represents the abandonment of the closest U.S. ally in the Middle East.


The White House said Tuesday that Biden would veto the bill if it were to pass Congress. The bill also has practically no chance in the Democratic-controlled Senate. But House Democrats are somewhat divided on the issue, and roughly two dozen have signed onto a letter to the Biden administration saying they were "deeply concerned about the message" sent by pausing the bomb shipment.


In addition to the written veto threat, the White House has been in touch with various lawmakers and congressional aides about the legislation, according to an administration official.


"We strongly, strongly oppose attempts to constrain the President's ability to deploy U.S. security assistance consistent with U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives," White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said this week, adding that the administration plans to spend "every last cent" appropriated by Congress in the national security supplemental package that was signed into law by Biden last month.

## Republicans advance Senate candidates in West Virginia, Maryland

date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA

ANNAPOLIS, Md.  — Republican voters advanced strong Senate contenders in Maryland and West Virginia on Tuesday, giving the party a big boost in its push to claim control of Congress' upper chamber.


Former Governor Larry Hogan claimed the Republican nomination in what will be a marquee race in Maryland against Angela Alsobrooks, a top local official who could become the fourth Black woman in U.S. history to serve in the Senate.


Meanwhile, another popular Republican, Governor Jim Justice, won the Senate nomination in deep-red West Virginia, becoming the overwhelming favorite in the race that represents the Republicans' best pickup opportunity in the nation.


In both states, which share a border but feature antithetical politics, the Republican nominees represent a serious challenge for Democrats in the general election as they cling to a 51-49 Senate majority and defend seats in other states that former President Donald Trump won four years ago.


At the same time, Trump and Democratic President Joe Biden sought to project strength in low-stakes presidential primaries. And further down the ballot, two people who were on opposite sides of the Jan. 6 insurrection lost their U.S. House bids — a former Capitol Police officer running in Maryland and a former West Virginia state lawmaker who participated in the riot.


In all, three states hosted statewide primary elections Tuesday — Maryland, Nebraska and West Virginia — as Republicans and Democrats picked their nominees for a slate of November elections that will decide the presidency and control of Congress.


Maryland


In Maryland, Hogan gives Republicans a legitimate chance at picking up a Senate seat in the deep-blue state for the first time in more than four decades.


Hogan overcame his years-long criticism of Trump, a position that put him at odds with many Republican primary voters but will undoubtedly help him in the general election this fall. Maryland voters gave Biden a 33-point victory over Trump four years ago.


On the other side in the Senate contest, Democratic voters nominated Alsobrooks, the top official in Prince George's County outside of Washington. The 53-year-old African American county executive had been endorsed by many of the state’s top officials, including Governor Wes Moore, Senator Chris Van Hollen and U.S. Representative Steny Hoyer.


Alsobrooks prevailed after a contentious and expensive primary against U.S. Representative David Trone, a liquor store magnate who had invested more than $61 million into his unsuccessful bid.


Race was an issue in the Democratic primary and may be in the general election in the months ahead. Alsobrooks is trying to become the first Black senator from a state in which roughly one in three residents identifies as African American.


On the social media site X, Hogan congratulated Alsobrooks and said, “Voters have a clear and stark choice: more of the dysfunctional partisan status quo or real independent and bipartisan leadership.”


Alsobrooks, also posting on X, promised to “defeat Larry Hogan, keep Maryland blue, and keep our Senate under Democratic control.”


West Virginia


Justice won his primary against U.S. Representative Alex Mooney in the race to replace Senator Joe Manchin. With Manchin gone, the seat is almost guaranteed to turn red come November.


Justice, a former billionaire with a folksy personality, is wildly popular in the state. He also earned Trump's endorsement. A former Democrat, Justice switched to the Republican Party in 2017, announcing the change at a Trump rally.


Mooney had tried to win over conservatives by labeling Justice as someone who would support Democratic policies. Justice did support Biden's bipartisan infrastructure law, saying West Virginia couldn't afford to turn away the money offered in the bill.


West Virginia is also deciding its candidates for governor. Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, the Republican nominee in the 2018 Senate race against Manchin, is running for the Republican nomination. He's up against former state Representative Moore Capito, whose mother is Senator Shelley Moore Capito.


Presidential primary


Biden and Trump have already amassed enough delegates to claim the presidential nominations at their respective national conventions this summer. Yet voters on both sides hope to register a significant protest vote Tuesday that will demonstrate their dissatisfaction with the Biden-Trump rematch.


Both Biden and Trump won their primaries in West Virginia and Maryland.


Still, Maryland progressives especially unhappy with the Biden administration's support for Israel in its war against Hamas had encouraged voters to select "uncommitted to any presidential candidate" instead of Biden. There was no uncommitted option in West Virginia or Nebraska.


Everett Bellamy, a Democrat who voted early in Annapolis, said he voted "uncommitted" instead of Biden as a protest against the killing of women and children and noncombatants in Gaza.


Meanwhile, Trump's Republican critics cannot choose "uncommitted," but they can choose his former Republican rival Nikki Haley, who will appear on the ballot in Maryland, Nebraska and West Virginia despite formally suspending her campaign more than two months ago.


Derek Faux, an independent voter from Charleston, West Virginia, said he supported Haley, and in other Republican races, he said he voted for the candidates he believed were least like Trump.


Capitol attack


Tuesday's elections also included two candidates who were intimately involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.


In Maryland, former Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn was among nearly two dozen Democrats running in the state’s 3rd Congressional District. The 40-year-old Democrat lost to State Senator Sarah Elfreth.


In West Virginia, a former member of the House of Delegates, Derrick Evans, lost his bid to oust incumbent Republican Representative Carol Miller in the 1st Congressional District.


The 39-year-old Evans served a three-month jail sentence after livestreaming himself participating in the storming of the U.S. Capitol.


Other key races


In Nebraska, Republican Senators Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts both face nominal opposition in their primaries, one of the rare occasions when both senators in a state are on the ballot at the same time. And in Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District, Republican U.S. Representative Don Bacon faces a challenge from his right flank.


In North Carolina, voters finalized their pick of the Trump-endorsed Brad Knott in what had become a one-person Republican primary in the state's 13th Congressional District.

## Justice Department says Boeing could be prosecuted in 737 Max crashes

date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Boeing has violated a settlement that allowed the company to avoid criminal prosecution after two deadly crashes involving its 737 Max aircraft more than five years ago, the Justice Department told a federal judge on Tuesday.


It is now up to the Justice Department to decide whether to file charges against Boeing. Prosecutors will tell the court no later than July 7 how they plan to proceed, the department said.


New 737 Max jets crashed in 2018 in Indonesia and 2019 in Ethiopia, killing 346 people. Boeing reached a $2.5 billion settlement with the Justice Department in January 2021 to avoid prosecution on a single charge of fraud — misleading federal regulators who approved the plane. Boeing blamed the deception on two relatively low-level employees.


In a letter filed Tuesday in federal court in Texas, Glenn Leon, head of the Justice Department criminal division's fraud section, said Boeing violated terms of the settlement by failing to make promised changes to detect and prevent violations of federal anti-fraud laws.


The determination means that Boeing could be prosecuted "for any federal criminal violation of which the United States has knowledge," including the charge of fraud that the company hoped to avoid with the settlement, the Justice Department said.


However, it is not clear whether the government will prosecute Boeing.


"The Government is determining how it will proceed in this matter," the Justice Department said in the court filing. Boeing will have until June 13 to respond to the government's allegation, and department said it will consider the company's explanation "in determining whether to pursue prosecution."


Boeing Co., which is based in Arlington, Virginia, disputed the Justice Department's finding.


"We believe that we have honored the terms of that agreement, and look forward to the opportunity to respond to the Department on this issue," a Boeing spokesperson said in a statement. "As we do so, we will engage with the Department with the utmost transparency, as we have throughout the entire term of the agreement, including in response to their questions following the Alaska Airlines 1282 accident."


Boeing has come under renewed scrutiny since that Alaska Airlines flight in January, when a door plug blew out of a 737 Max, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the jetliner. The company is under multiple investigations into the blowout and its manufacturing quality. The FBI has told passengers from the flight that they might be victims of a crime.


Prosecutors said they will meet on May 31 with families of passengers who died in the two Max crashes. Family members were angry and disappointed after a similar meeting last month.


Paul Cassell, a lawyer who represents families of passengers in the second crash, said the Justice Department's determination that Boeing breached the settlement terms is "a positive first step, and for the families, a long time coming."


"But we need to see further action from DOJ to hold Boeing accountable, and plan to use our meeting on May 31 to explain in more details what we believe would be a satisfactory remedy to Boeing's ongoing criminal conduct," Cassell said.


Investigations into the crashes pointed to a flight-control system that Boeing added to the Max without telling pilots or airlines. Boeing downplayed the significance of the system, then didn't overhaul it until after the second crash.


After secret negotiations, the government agreed not to prosecute Boeing on a charge of defrauding the United States by deceiving regulators about the flight system. The settlement included a $243.6 million fine, a $500 million fund for victim compensation, and nearly $1.8 billion to airlines whose Max jets were grounded for nearly two years.

## The new APT 3.0 solver

date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News

A crucial but often entirely transparent feature of a modern package management system like Debian&#8217;s APT is its solver &#8211; basically the set of rules and instruction on how to handle dependencies when installing a package. APT is currently in the process of radically changing its solver, the first bits of which can be found in APT 2.9.3, referred to as solver3. Many of the changes and improvements get a little into the weeds and will mostly be transparent to users, but there is one feature the new solver will enable that many of you will be incredibly excited about. One of the core new capabilities of solver3 is the implication graph. As part of the solving phase, we also construct an implication graph, albeit a partial one: The first package installing another package is marked as the reason (A -&#62; B), the same thing for conflicts (not A -&#62; not B). ↫ Julian Andres Klode Seems rather innocuous at first sight, but here&#8217;s what the implication graph will make possible: The implication graph building allows us to implement an apt why command, that while not as nicely detailed as aptitude, at least tells you the exact reason why a package is installed. It will only show the strongest dependency chain at first of course, since that is what we record. ↫ Julian Andres Klode If you&#8217;ve ever dealt with packaging issues &#8211; probably when running -testing or similar unstable distributions that use APT, a command that tells you exactly why a package is installed is an absolute godsend. Sure, aptitude exists, but aptitude takes you out of your current CLI workflow, whereas this will be much easier to quickly run. There&#8217;s more features solver3 will enable, but this one is definitely one of my favourite low-level additions to APT in a long, long time.

## Google details some of the “AI” features coming to Android

date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News

Google I/O, the company&#8217;s developer conference, started today, but for the first time since I can remember, Android and Chrome OS have been relegated to day two of the conference. The first day was all about &#8220;AI&#8221;, most of which I&#8217;m not even remotely interested in, except of course where it related to Google&#8217;s operating system offerings. And the company did have a few things to say about &#8220;AI&#8221; on Android, and the general gist is that yeah, they&#8217;re going to be stuffing it into every corner of the operating system. Google&#8217;s &#8220;AI&#8221; tool Gemini will be integrated deeply into Android, and you&#8217;ll be able to call up an overlay wherever you are in the operating system, and do things like summarise a PDF that&#8217;s on screen, summarise a YouTube video, generate images on the fly and drop them into emails and conversations, and so on. A more interesting and helpful &#8220;AI&#8221; addition is using it to improve TalkBack, so that people with impaired vision can let the device describe images on the screen for them. Google claims TalkBack users come across about 90 images without description every day (!), so this is a massive improvement for people with impaired vision, and a genuinely helpful and worthwhile &#8220;AI&#8221; feature. Creepier is that Google&#8217;s &#8220;AI&#8221; will also be able to listen along with your phone calls, and warn you if an ongoing conversation is a scamming attempt. If the person on the other end of the line claiming to be your bank asks you to move a bunch of money around to keep it safe, Gemini will pop up and warn you it&#8217;s a scam, since banks don&#8217;t ask you such things. Clever, sure, but also absolutely terrifying and definitely not something I&#8217;ll be turning on. Google claims all of these features take place on-device, so privacy should be respected, but I&#8217;m always a bit unsure about such things staying that way in the future. Regardless, &#8220;AI&#8221; is coming to Android in a big way, but I&#8217;m just here wondering how much of it I&#8217;ll be able to turn off.

## VMware Workstation Pro and Fusion pro go free for personal use

date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News

After Broadcom acquired VMware, there&#8217;s been a steady stream of worrying or outright bad news for people using VMware products at home, for personal use, as enthusiasts. The biggest blow to the enthusiast market was the end of perpetual licensing, forcing people into subscriptions instead. Finally, though it seems we&#8217;re getting some good news. The most exciting part is that Fusion Pro and Workstation Pro will now have two license models. We now provide a Free Personal Use or a Paid Commercial Use subscription for our Pro apps. Users will decide based on their use case whether a commercial subscription is required. This means that everyday users who want a virtual lab on their Mac, Windows or Linux computer can do so for free simply by registering and downloading the bits from the new download portal located at support.broadcom.com. ↫ Michael Roy on the VMware blog This is definitely good news for us enthusiasts, and it means I won&#8217;t have to buy a cheap VMware license off eBay every few years anymore, so I&#8217;m quite satisfied here. However, with VMware under Broadcom focusing more and more on the enterprise and squeezing every last penny out of those customers, one has to wonder if this &#8216;free for personal use&#8217; is just a prelude to winding down the development of enthusiasts&#8217; tools altogether. It wouldn&#8217;t be the first time that a product going free for personal use was a harbinger of worse things yet to come.

## 13 Ways of Looking at Biden’s New China Tariffs

date: 2024-05-14, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjIzODA1Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MTgyNTE5OH0.E94t-k31AKkmA5L8syzDuFvMTgrMSyAgLh2YeCbLsfM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	The United States <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/14/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-action-to-protect-american-workers-and-businesses-from-chinas-unfair-trade-practices/" target="_blank">raised tariffs</a> on a range of Chinese-made climate technologies on Tuesday, including electric vehicles, solar panels, and battery components.
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45236/thirteen-ways-of-looking-at-a-blackbird" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Inspired by the poet Wallace Stevens</u></a>, here are 13 ways of looking at them:
</p><h4>
	1. </h4><p>The biggest tariffs in the bunch are for Chinese-made electric vehicles. The Biden administration has more than quadrupled them, imposing a 100% tariff on all vehicle imports. That means that Chinese-made EVs now face <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2018/03/28/u-s-tariffs-vary-a-lot-but-the-highest-duties-tend-to-be-on-imported-clothing/" target="_blank">higher tariff levels</a> than any other imported goods.
</p><p>
	Right now, the U.S. imports relatively few electric vehicles from China, and the few vehicles that we do import — which are made by the Chinese-owned brands Volvo and Polestar — may not be affected by these levies <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/how-volvo-landed-cheap-chinese-ev-us-shores-trade-war-2024-04-24/" target="_blank">because of how imports are counted under tariff law</a>. (Neither Volvo nor Polestar has commented on the new rates.)
</p><p>
	What’s more, the White House <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/chinese-ev-cars-biden" target="_self"><u>suggested in February that it would use national security law</u></a> to prevent EVs from Chinese companies from coming into the United States at all — even if the cars were made in a country with which the U.S. has a free trade agreement, such as Mexico. So despite the eye-popping headline figure, the tariffs on Chinese EVs do relatively little to change the decarbonization calculus in the United States. America wasn’t going to import Chinese-made EVs before, and it’s not going to do so now.
</p><h4>2.</h4><p><strong></strong>While these EV tariffs may be more for show than anything else, that is <em><em>not </em></em>true for the other tariffs on clean technologies. Many of these categories already faced trade levies imposed by the Trump administration, and Biden has now raised them, effectively doubling down on his electoral rival’s policy.</p><p>
	Starting immediately:
</p><ul>
<li><strong>For lithium-ion EV batteries</strong>, tariffs rise from 7.5% to 25%.</li>
<li><strong>For EV battery parts</strong>, tariffs rise from 7.5% to 25%. (This closes a loophole in the Trump levies in which <em><em>completed </em></em>EV batteries faced a much lower tariff rate than battery components, encouraging automakers to import finished batteries.)</li>
<li><strong>For many critical minerals</strong>, tariffs rise from zero to 25%.</li>
<li><strong>For solar cells</strong>, tariffs rise from 25% to 50%.</li>
</ul><p>
	The solar cell figure looks impressive — and has been the source of wrangling in the solar industry — but it matters less than it looks. The United States already imports <a href="https://www.rechargenews.com/energy-transition/us-factories-under-threat-from-unprecedented-wave-of-chinese-solar-panel-imports/2-1-1604599" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more than 80% of its solar panels</u></a> from Chinese companies operating in other Asian countries.
</p><p>
	A second round of tariffs is scheduled to kick in in 2026. Even though these hikes won’t take effect immediately, they may counterintuitively matter <em><em>more</em></em>, because they affect sectors where China now dominates the global industry. The longer timeline suggests that the White House is trying not to disrupt the near-term market too much; in effect, it’s giving companies a deadline to diversify their supply chains. This second round includes:
</p><ul>
<li><strong>For non-EV lithium-ion batteries</strong>, such as the type you’d need for <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/texas-california-grid-batteries" target="_self"><u>grid-scale batteries</u></a>, tariffs rise from 7.5% to 25% in 2026. These batteries are already changing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/05/07/climate/battery-electricity-solar-california-texas.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>how the power grid works</u></a> and the White House may be loath to stop the progress.</li>
<li><strong>For natural graphite and permanent magnets</strong>, tariffs will rise to 25% in 2026. China <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-new-graphite-restrictions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>refines 90% of the world’s graphite</u></a>, and it <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/graphite-batteries-trade-war-us-china" target="_self"><u>has already tried</u></a> to use this as leverage in a trade dispute with the U.S., imposing export restrictions on three high-purity grades of graphite last year.</li>
</ul><h4>
	3. </h4><p>Whether you love them or hate them, you shouldn’t see these tariffs as a standalone measure. They complement the aggressive subsidies that the Biden administration has already passed on EVs, batteries, and critical minerals in the Inflation Reduction Act. It’s often lost that the IRA subsidizes EVs and their constituent parts in two ways — not only with the somewhat convoluted<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/ev-tax-credit-new-2024" target="_self"><u> $7,500 personal vehicle tax credit</u></a>, but with the <em><em>more important </em></em><a href="https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/publications/the-ira-and-the-us-battery-supply-chain-one-year-on/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>45X production tax credit</u></a>, which pays companies $35 for each kilowatt-hour of EV batteries that they produce in the United States. (There are similar 45X bounties for other manufactured goods, including solar panels.)
</p><h4>
	4. </h4><p>These policies now add up to classic industrial policy <a href="https://itif.org/centers/hamilton/#:~:text=The%20Hamiltonian%20agenda%20entails%20more,economic%20and%20national%20security..." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>in the mold of Alexander Hamilton</u></a>: The U.S. is hiking tariffs on high-value imports while subsidizing their domestic production, while also providing cheap credit <a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-13-jigar-shah" target="_self"><u>via the Department of Energy</u></a> to companies that want to participate in these new industries. The Environmental Protection Agency has also issued <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/epa-auto-emissions-rule" target="_self"><u>new rules</u></a> that will encourage U.S. consumers to buy from these new domestic producers. The one element of the classic model the U.S. has not yet adopted — except in some states — is provisioning cheap land and easy permitting for new factories.
</p><h4>
	5. </h4><p>China, it should be said, followed a similar playbook to develop its own electric vehicle industry. That should let us dispel with one foolish idea right away: the premise that tariffs never work. On the contrary, tariffs sometimes <em><em>do</em></em> work; as the economist Brad Setser <a href="https://twitter.com/Brad_Setser/status/1789875275959812167" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pointed out</u></a> on the social network X, America only finds itself in its current position because of how <em><em>well</em></em> tariffs worked. Through a range of policies including tariffs and joint ventures, China walled off its domestic market and encouraged domestic industry. That industry has now grown to challenge the world.
</p><h4>
	6. </h4><p>But they do not always work. Another important aspect of Hamiltonian industrial policy is <em><em>certainty: </em></em>To make forward-looking investment decisions, companies need to know policies that exist today will still be around when the production line starts whirring. This China has in gobs, and the United States lacks. You may have noticed that the front-runner in this year’s presidential election is promising to repeal many of these policies that are now rolling out — just about everything but the tariffs.
</p><h4>
	7. </h4><p>These tariff rates are unlikely to go down anytime soon. There is no party in American politics advocating for free trade with China. The choice, in the near-term, is between Biden’s vision of free trade with democracies and developing countries, plus climate and defense-driven industrial policy at the margins, versus Trump’s vision of fossil-fueled populism that aspires to autarky.
</p><p>
	There are forces within the country that wouldn’t hate to see a return of more open trade relations with China — you can see factions within the environmental movement, the Chamber of Commerce, and Big Tech pushing for it, to name a few — but they do not control a partisan coalition.
</p><h4>
	8. </h4><p>There is no equivalence between what the Biden administration announced today and the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/biden-sharply-hikes-us-tariffs-billions-chinese-chips-cars-2024-05-14/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>10% across the board tariff</u></a> on all imported goods from all countries that Donald Trump has proposed. Biden’s new tariffs focus on certain strategic sectors that American officials believe the country must cultivate to stay at the technological frontier, coupled with pre-existing subsidies meant to spur domestic production of those goods. Some of the tariffs only kick in beginning in 2026 — far enough in the future, policymakers hope, for the market to prepare. Trump’s tariffs, meanwhile, would intentionally and chaotically hike prices.
</p><h4>
	9. </h4><p>We’re only here because China has won Round 1 on electric vehicles. It has created a thriving, competitive domestic EV industry that includes the BYD Seagull, an $11,000 hatchback that gets up to 250 miles of range; the Zeekr 009, a $70,000 minivan with more than 500 miles of range; and the Xiaomi SU7, a sleek $29,000 coupe. As the car journalist Kevin Williams <a href="https://insideevs.com/features/719015/china-is-ahead-of-west/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has written</u></a>, China’s EV market is far deeper, more varied, and more sophisticated than many realize. Beijing has built a Silicon Valley-style industrial cluster that produces cheap electric vehicles for the domestic market and the world — and the Biden administration can do almost nothing about that.
</p><p>
	This dominance has emerged out of China’s economic agglomeration and its successful climb up the technological value chain. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/27/opinion/gm-ford-electric-vehicles.html?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>As I’ve written</u></a>, China once made textiles and toys; then it made smartphones and computers; now it makes EVs and commercial jetliners. This agglomeration of economic complexity is not an academic observation; in many cases, the companies now producing China’s most competitive EVs emerged directly from its electronics industry. Xiaomi, after all, makes 15% of the world’s smartphones. CATL — now widely seen as the world’s best EV battery maker — began as a spin-off of Amperex Technology Limited, or ATL, which makes smartphone batteries. The iPhone is, in a sense, the younger sister of the Chinese-made Volvo EX30: Both are Western-designed consumer electronics that are made in Chinese factories, through Chinese engineering expertise.
</p><h4>10. </h4><p>Does one need to spell out precisely why American officials might care about staying even vaguely competitive with China in the EV industry? Do I need to mention the role that American-made motor vehicles have played in world history? But the motorization of war — which has now gone on for nearly a century — requires getting fossil fuels to the front lines in dangerous convoys; by one estimate, <a href="https://energypost.eu/u-s-militarys-mobile-mini-nuclear-fewer-fuel-supply-convoys-mean-fewer-casualties/#:~:text=Approximately%2018%2C700%20casualties%2C%20or%2052,with%20resupplying%20fuel%20and%20water." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more than half of the 36,000 casualties</u></a> suffered by American troops in Iraq were on fuel or water resupply missions. Wind and solar are not now so potent that they could liberate armies from these serpentine supply chains, but energy technologies can drive surprising military innovations anyway: In Ukraine and Nagorno-Karabakh, we have already seen how <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-electric-bikes-war-russia-technology/31865559.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>e-bikes</u></a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/UKRAINE-CRISIS/DRONES/dwpkeyjwkpm/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>drones</u></a> powered by small, lightweight batteries have transformed modern warfare.
</p><h4>
	11. </h4><p>Perhaps this kind of thinking is premature, or too dire. Nonetheless, <em><em>this</em></em> is what makes this moment so different from the 1970s, when Japanese-made cars changed the American car market, or the 1980s and ‘90s, when the Korean brands arrived. For the first time, a country outside the American security umbrella — a country that, in fact, aims to compete as a geopolitical hegemon with the U.S. — has attained the cutting edge of motor vehicle production. Even if Michigan and Wisconsin were not so important in the Electoral College, even if climate change did not require the rapid decarbonization of the global car fleet, that fact alone would distinguish this moment from what has come before. This is why the Chinese EV industry poses such a profound challenge to American policy.
</p><h4>
	12. </h4><p>This challenge for the U.S. also requires conjuring an entire value chain from nothing. A thoroughly classic Hamiltonian industrial policy would involve reducing tariffs on commodity and low-value inputs, such as the minerals that make up batteries, while increasing them on high-value imports, such as completed batteries and cars. But China controls so much of the critical mineral supply chain — it is <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/chinas-role-in-supplying-critical-minerals-for-the-global-energy-transition-what-could-the-future-hold/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>“the dominant player” in global minerals refining</u></a> — that American officials feel like they must diversify; they must try to spin up low value supply chains for graphite, lithium, and rare earths at the same time that they encourage the construction of EV factories.
</p><h4>
	13. </h4><p>One of the most important aspects of the Inflation Reduction Act is that it pursues two simultaneous industrial policies: In some sectors (EVs, solar, batteries), it aims for America to catch up to its technological rivals; in others (carbon capture, hydrogen), it aims to preserve America’s pre-existing position at the technological frontier. Notice what industries <em><em>aren’t</em></em> affected by today’s tariffs — not carbon capture, not anything to do with fossil fuels, not even anything hydrogen-related, even though China <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/will-making-hydrogen-green-depend-on-china/#:~:text=Despite%20emerging%20U.S.%20manufacturing%2C%20China,research%20firm%20Clean%20Energy%20Associates." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>makes 61% of the world’s electrolyzers</u></a>. (That is because the Biden administration <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/hydrogen-rule-biden-clean-energy" target="_self"><u>has shaped its hydrogen policy</u></a> so it does not automatically favor the type of electrolyzer that Chinese firms make.)
</p><p>
	It’s easy to get ahead of oneself here. Just because China has created a superior EV industry, that doesn’t mean it will have one forever; just because China makes better EVs, that doesn’t mean that America lags on all climate technologies. But make no mistake: America is trying to do something very difficult, and it has no guarantee of success.

## Judge rejects Hunter Biden's bid to delay his June trial on federal gun charges

date: 2024-05-14, from: VOA News USA

WILMINGTON, Delaware — Hunter Biden's federal gun case will go to trial next month, a judge said Tuesday, denying a bid by lawyers for the president's son to delay the prosecution. 


U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika rejected Hunter Biden's request to push the trial until September, which the defense said was necessary to give the defense time to line up witnesses and go through evidence handed over by prosecutors. 


President Joe Biden's son is accused of lying about his drug use in October 2018 on a form to buy a gun that he kept for about 11 days. 


Hunter Biden, who has pleaded not guilty, has acknowledged struggling with an addiction to crack cocaine during that period in 2018, but his lawyers have said he didn't break the law. 


His attorneys have argued that prosecutors bowed to pressure by Republicans, who claimed the Democratic president's son was initially given a sweetheart deal, and that he was indicted because of political pressure. 


But the judge overseeing the case last month rejected his claim that the prosecution is politically motivated along with other efforts to dismiss the case. The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last week said the case could move forward to trial. 


Hunter Biden was supposed to plead guilty last year to misdemeanor tax charges and would have avoided prosecution on the gun charges had he stayed out of trouble for two years. It was the culmination of a yearslong investigation by federal prosecutors into the business dealings of the president's son, and the agreement would have dispensed with criminal proceedings and spared the Bidens weeks of headlines as the 2024 election loomed. 


But the deal broke down after the judge who was supposed to sign off on the agreement instead raised a series of questions about it. 


Hunter Biden was indicted on three gun firearms charges in Delaware and was charged separately in California, where he lives, with tax crimes. 


He's charged in the Delaware case with two counts of making false statements, first for checking a box falsely saying he was not addicted to drugs and second for giving it to the shop for their federally required records. A third count alleges he possessed the gun for about 11 days despite knowing he was a drug user. 


In California, Hunter Biden is charged with three felonies and six misdemeanors over at least $1.4 million in taxes he owed between 2016 and 2019. Prosecutors have accused him of spending millions of dollars on an "extravagant lifestyle" instead of paying his taxes. The back taxes have since been paid.

## It’s fun to do silly things

date: 2024-05-14, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>I spend my time doing things online. I design and code websites for clients, I make websites for friends, and I start—and almost always shut down—all sorts of weird side projects. It’s easy to take this online life too seriously. If you go online you’ll immediately find people discussing business strategies and ways to monetise everything they do. Which is fine but also exhausting. The web is so caught up in the hustler mentality that it’s forgetting that some things can just be hobbies.</p>
<p>I interviewed 37 people for my P&amp;B series at this point and if I’m not mistaken, all 37 of them are just happy to have a blog they pay for and have no plans to monetise it whatsoever. It’s a hobby, they enjoy doing it and that’s absolutely fine.</p>
<p>In a few days, I’ll renew the domain for [theforest.link]. That site has so far generated 0$. I spent around 50$ just for the domain at this point. But should I care? Should I monetise this? Hell no. Carl and I built it because it’s fun, because the idea of helping people discover some new random wacky website is fun.</p>
<p>The other day I was doing some design admin on my <a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale">Ko-Fi</a> because I wanted to update a few of the graphics in there. And while I was doing that I had this completely stupid idea of creating a new membership tier called <em>The "I have F** you money" Club</em>. Do I expect anyone to actually subscribe? Obviously not, I did it because it’s silly, because I hope someone will laugh at the stupidity of it all. I did it because it’s fun to do silly things.</p>
<p>Did you make anything silly recently? If you did show it to me! Send me an email, I want to see it.</p>                <hr>

## Harvard students end protest as school agrees to discuss Gaza conflict

date: 2024-05-14, from: VOA News USA

CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts — Protesters against the war between Israel and Hamas were voluntarily taking down their tents in Harvard Yard on Tuesday after university officials agreed to discuss their questions about the endowment, bringing a peaceful end to the kinds of demonstrations that were broken up by police on other campuses. 


The student protest group Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine said in a statement that the encampment "outlasted its utility with respect to our demands." Meanwhile, Harvard University interim President Alan Garber agreed to pursue a meeting between protesters and university officials regarding the students' questions. 


Students at many college campuses this spring set up similar encampments, calling for their schools to cut ties with Israel and businesses that support it. 


The Israel-Hamas war began when Hamas and other militants stormed into southern Israel on October 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages. Palestinian militants still hold about 100 captives, and Israel's military has killed more than 35,000 people in Gaza, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants. 


Harvard said its president and the dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Hopi Hoekstra, will meet with the protesters to discuss the conflict in the Middle East. 


The protesters said they worked out an agreement to meet with university officials, including the Harvard Management Company, which oversees the world's largest academic endowment, valued at about $50 billion. 


The protesters' statement said the students will set an agenda that includes discussions on disclosure, divestment, reinvestment and the creation of a Center for Palestine Studies. The students also said that Harvard has offered to retract suspensions of more than 20 students and student workers and back down on disciplinary measures faced by 60 more. 


"Since its establishment three weeks ago, the encampment has both broadened and deepened Palestine solidarity organizing on campus," a spokesperson for the protesters said. "It has moved the needle on disclosure and divestment at Harvard."

## US puts sanctions on Russian man, three companies for sanctions evasion scheme

date: 2024-05-14, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The U.S. Treasury on Tuesday put sanctions on a Russian citizen and three Russia-based companies it said were trying to evade U.S. sanctions in a scheme that could have unfrozen more than $1.5 billion belonging to Russian metals tycoon Oleg Deripaska.


Deripaska, who himself was placed under U.S. sanctions in April 2018, branched out into metals trading as the Soviet Union crumbled, making a fortune by buying up stakes in aluminum factories. Forbes ranked his fortune this year at $2.8 billion.


The Treasury said that in June 2023 Deripaska coordinated with Russian citizens Dmitrii Beloglazov, the owner of Russia-based financial services firm Obshchestvo S Ogranichennoi Otvetstvennostiu Titul (Titul), on a planned transaction to sell Deripaska's frozen shares in a European company.  


Within weeks of this, Russia-based financial services firm Aktsionernoe Obshchestvo Iliadis was set up as a subsidiary of Titul. In early 2024, Iliadis acquired Russia-based investment holding company International Company Joint Stock Company Rasperia Trading Limited (Rasperia), which holds Deripaska's frozen shares. 


The Treasury said sanctions were imposed on Beloglazov, Titul, and Iliadis on Tuesday for operating or having operated in Russia's financial services sector. It said Rasperia was sanctioned for being owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act on behalf of Iliadis.

## Google is experimenting with running Chrome OS on Android

date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News

Now that Android &#8211; since version 13 &#8211; ships with the Android Virtualisation Framework, Google can start doing interesting things with it. It turns out the first interesting thing Google wants do with it is run Chrome OS inside of it. Even though AVF was initially designed around running small workloads in a highly stripped-down build of Android loaded in an isolated virtual machine, there’s technically no reason it can’t be used to run other operating systems. As a matter of fact, this was demonstrated already when developer Danny Lin got Windows 11 running on an Android phone back in 2022. Google itself never officially provided support for running anything other than its custom build of Android called “microdroid” in AVF, but that’s no longer the case. The company has started to offer official support for running Chromium OS, the open-source version of Chrome OS, on Android phones through AVF, and it has even been privately demoing this to other companies. At a privately held event, Google recently demonstrated a special build of Chromium OS — code-named “ferrochrome” — running in a virtual machine on a Pixel 8. However, Chromium OS wasn’t shown running on the phone’s screen itself. Rather, it was projected to an external display, which is possible because Google recently enabled display output on its Pixel 8 series. Time will tell if Google is thinking of positioning Chrome OS as a platform for its desktop mode ambitions and Samsung DeX rival. ↫ Mishaal Rahman at Android Authority It seems that Google is in the phase of exploring if there are any OEMs interested in allowing users to plug their Android phone into an external display and input devices and run Chrome OS on it. This sounds like an interesting approach to the longstanding dream of convergence &#8211; one device for all your computing needs &#8211; but at the same time, it feels quite convoluted to have your Android device emulate an entire Chrome OS installation. What a damning condemnation of Android as a platform that despite years of trying, Google just can&#8217;t seem to make Android and its applications work in a desktop form factor. I&#8217;ve tried to shoehorn Android into a desktop workflow, and it&#8217;s quite hard, despite third parties having made some interesting tools to help you along. It really seems Android just does not want to be anywhere else but on a mobile touch display.

## Nintendo Switch hacked to run Windows 11 on Arm

date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News

As Nintendo Switch unlocks and homebrew software develops, people are inclined to explore the possibilities and whether or not they actually provide a good experience. Our new prime example seems to be a full install of Windows 11 Arm on the Switch. As noted by @PatRyk on Twitter, who actually set this up, the experience is pretty grueling! The initial installation took three hours, and even basic system tasks were unresponsive. ↫ Christopher Harper at Tom&#8217;s Hardware Silly, sure, but efforts like these all contribute to emulation efforts, which will eventually be important once Nintendo drops support for this machine and they become increasingly harder to get. Give it a decade or so and we&#8217;ll need the Switch emulators to keep playing Switch games.

## Biden quadruples tariffs on Chinese EVs

date: 2024-05-14, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — In a bid to revive domestic manufacturing, President Joe Biden announced Tuesday that he is imposing a drastic tariff increase on Chinese electric vehicles and new levies on computer chips, solar cells and lithium-ion batteries.      


"We're not going to let China flood our market making it impossible for American auto – auto manufacturers to compete fairly," Biden said. "I will do it by following international trade laws."  


Tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, also known as EVs, will be quadrupled to a 100% rate. Solar cell and semiconductor imports from China will be subject to a 50% tariff, double the current rate. The rate on certain steel and aluminum imports will increase to 25%, more than triple the current level.  


The tariff increase will cover $18 billion in Chinese products. Tariffs on EVs, steel and aluminum, and solar cells will take effect this year, and next year for chips.   


United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the administration has provided pre-notification to Beijing.     


"We have made clear this is not about escalation," she said. "This is about the consequences of decades of economic policy and the need for the United States to defend our rights."   


The move is designed to offset "China's unfair practices and subsidies and level the playing field for U.S. automakers and auto workers," National Economic Adviser Lael Brainard told reporters Monday ahead of the announcement.  


"China is simply too big to play by its own rules," she said. "China is using the same playbook it has before to power its own growth at the expense of others by continuing to invest, despite excess Chinese capacity, and flooding global markets with exports that are underpriced due to unfair practices."     


China's "forced technology transfers and intellectual property theft" have contributed to its control of the majority of global production for the critical inputs "creating unacceptable risks to America's supply chains and economic security," the White House said.


Responding to the U.S. announcement, China said Tuesday the move "will seriously affect the atmosphere of bilateral cooperation."    


"The U.S. is essentially using the 'overcapacity' narrative to kneecap other countries' strong industries and practice protectionism and trample on market principles and international trade rules in the name of 'fair competition.' This is nothing but bullying," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters Tuesday in Beijing.


Tough on China    


The move follows a three-year review of the policies of Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, who is the Republican presumptive presidential nominee. Both candidates have used their campaign events to compete in showing who is tougher on China ahead of the November election.  


"My predecessor promised to increase American exports and boost manufacturing, but he did neither. He failed," Biden said.   


The former president said Tuesday that the Biden administration's new tariffs will not be enough to compete against Beijing.  


"China's eating our lunch right now," Trump said, adding that Biden should slap tariffs on "much more than electric vehicles."     


"They've also got to do it on other vehicles, and they have to do it on a lot of other products," Trump told reporters as he entered court for his hush money trial in New York.   


Asked by reporters on Trump's comment about China eating America's lunch (unfairly taking advantage of the U.S.), Biden responded, "He's been feeding them a long time."  


The Trump campaign hit back, calling Biden's action a "weak and futile attempt to distract from the grievous harm his insane Electric Vehicle mandate is doing to the U.S. auto industry."    

   

"The fact that these tariffs do not apply to gas-powered cars and trucks but only to Chinese EVs shows that this has nothing to do with protecting American Workers," Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. "It's all about Crooked Joe's agenda of killing gas-powered automobiles while forcing Americans into ultra-expensive Electric Vehicles they don't want and can't afford."  

   

Asked by VOA to respond to such criticism, Tai said the tariffs are "designed to be strategic and not chaotic. They are designed to be effective and not emotional."   

   

Preempting future increases  


Currently, the U.S. imports almost no EVs from China, but the Biden administration is trying to preempt potential future increases, said Rachel Ziemba, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, or CNAS.  


The tariffs hit sectors where the administration has been investing with industrial policy tools, including the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act, Ziemba told VOA, referring to Biden's climate and energy legislation, and legislation to boost domestic semiconductor research and manufacturing.  


"In a sense, these tariffs are part of a policy initiative to make sure that Chinese companies can't benefit from that U.S. government subsidy," he said.  


The move is likely to increase friction between the world's two largest economies and is not likely to change Beijing's behavior.    


"China opposes unilateral tariffs that violate WTO rules and will take all measures necessary to defend our legitimate rights and interests," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang said.      


Biden reiterated he wants "fair competition with China, not conflict." He said the U.S. is in a stronger position to win because of the investments his administration has made to revive domestic manufacturing.  


According to a 2022 report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, China spent more on industrial policy ($248 billion) than it did on its defense spending ($240 billion) in 2019.  


China spends far more supporting its industries than any other economy in the CSIS study, and more than twice as much as the U.S.  


Circumventing through Mexico 


On the same day Biden announced the new tariffs, Chinese automaker BYD, the world's largest electric vehicle producer, unveiled the Shark, a midsize hybrid-electric pickup truck, in Mexico. In February, BYD said it was looking for a location in Mexico for its factory.   


A Mexico-made EV with sufficient North America-sourced parts could qualify for tariff-free entry into the U.S. market under the 2020 United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA. 


The administration said Beijing's move to circumvent tariffs via a U.S. free trade partner is "a pattern" of "serious concern" that it's investigating. 


With Chinese EV production moving out of China, taking action against Chinese EVs in third country markets is something that the administration should deeply explore, said Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade negotiator who is now vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute. 


Blocking Beijing's circumvention effort can be done by amending the USMCA or through supplemental agreements, or an investment screening mechanism separate from the USMCA, she told VOA. "I'm sure there are other alternatives as well that are being explored."  


Tai would only reveal that addressing the issue will "require a separate pathway," without providing details. "I would just ask you to stay tuned," she said. 


Anita Powell contributed to this report.

FERC is also requiring regional transmission planners to consult a specific set of economic and reliability benefits like reducing congestion on the grid and resilience against extreme weather and lower costs when selecting projects. And transmission planners will have to come up with a default method for allocating costs associated with new projects.

## EA is prototyping in-game ads even as we speak

date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News

Electronic Arts has a long, storied history of trying to wring more money out of gamers after they’ve purchased a game — now, it appears, the company’s hard at work on its next generation of in-game ads. EA CEO Andrew Wilson admitted as much on the company’s Q4 earnings call: when an analyst asked about “the market opportunity for more dynamic ad insertion across more traditional AAA games,” he said the company’s already working on it. “We have teams internally in the company right now looking at how do we do very thoughtful implementations inside of our game experiences,” said Wilson. ↫ Sean Hollister at The Verge Ads in games are definitely not new &#8211; we&#8217;ve seen countless games built entirely around brands, like Tapper for Budweiser, Pepsiman, or Cool Spot for 7-Up &#8211; and banner ads and product placement in various games has been a thing for decades, too. It seems like EA wants to take this several steps further and use things like dynamic ad insertion in games, so that when you&#8217;re playing some racing game, you&#8217;ll get an ad for your local Hyundai dealer, or an ad for a gun store when you&#8217;re playing GTA in the US. Either way, it&#8217;s going to make games worse, which is perfectly in line with EA&#8217;s mission.

## 2024 public data file now available, featuring new experimental formats

date: 2024-05-14, from: Crossref Blog

<p>This year’s public data file is now available, featuring over 156 million metadata records deposited with Crossref through the end of April 2024 from over 19,000 members. A full breakdown of Crossref metadata statistics is available <a href="https://www.crossref.org/06members/53status.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Like last year, you can download all of these records in one go via Academic Torrents or directly from Amazon S3 via the “requester pays” method.</p>
<p><strong>Download the file:</strong> The torrent download can be initiated <a href="https://academictorrents.com/details/4426fa56a4f3d376ece9ac37ed088095a30de568" target="_blank">here</a>. Instructions for downloading via the “requester pays” method, along with other tips for using these files, can be found on the <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/tips-for-using-public-data-files-and-plus-snapshots/">“Tips for working with Crossref public data files and Plus snapshots”</a> page.</p>
<p>In January, Martin Eve <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/increasing-crossref-data-reusability-with-format-experiments/">announced</a> that we had been experimenting with alternative file formats meant to make our public data files easier to use by broader audiences. This year’s file will be published alongside the tools that can be used on the public data file to produce two experimental formats: <a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/labs/packer" target="_blank">JSON-lines</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/labs/dois2sqlite" target="_blank">SQLite</a> (and a bonus <a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/labs/rustsqlitepacker" target="_blank">Rust version</a>). You can read more about our thinking behind this work in <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/increasing-crossref-data-reusability-with-format-experiments/">Martin’s blog post</a>, and we are keen to hear your thoughts on these alternatives.</p>
<p>Our annual public data file is meant to facilitate individuals and organizations interested in working with the entirety of our metadata corpus. Starting with the majority of our metadata records in one file should be much easier than starting from scratch with our API, but because Crossref metadata is always openly available, you can use <a href="https://api.crossref.org/" target="_blank">the API</a> to keep your local copy up to date with new and updated records.</p>
<p>If you’re curious about what you’ll get with the public data file, we’ve also published a sample version so that you can take a peek before committing to downloading the ~212 gb file. This file includes a random sample of JSON files and is available exclusively via torrent <a href="https://academictorrents.com/details/d47fbe29e5ef93a6695421f79a6efa4b801acff1" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>We hope you find this public data file useful. Should you have any questions about how to access or use the file, please see the tips below, or share your questions below (you will be redirected to our community forum).</p>
<h3 id="tips-for-using-the-torrent-and-retrieving-incremental-updates">Tips for using the torrent and retrieving incremental updates</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use the public data file if you want all Crossref metadata records. Everyone is welcome to the metadata, but it will be much faster for you and much easier on our APIs to get so many records in one file. Here are some <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/tips-for-using-public-data-files-and-plus-snapshots/">tips on how to work with the file</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the REST API to incrementally add new and updated records once you have the initial file. Here is <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/tips-for-using-the-crossref-rest-api/">how to get started</a> (and avoid getting blocked in your enthusiasm to use all this great metadata!).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While bibliographic metadata is generally required, because lots of metadata is optional, records will vary in quality and completeness.</p>
