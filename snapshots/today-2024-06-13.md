## US reporter Evan Gershkovich, jailed in Russia on espionage charges, to stand trial, officials say

date: 2024-06-13, from: VOA News USA

Moscow — American reporter Evan Gershkovich, jailed in Russia on espionage charges, will stand trial in the city of Yekaterinburg, Russian authorities said Thursday.


Russia's Prosecutor General's office said an indictment of Gershkovich has been finalized and his case was filed to the Sverdlovsky Regional Court in the city in the Ural Mountains.


Gershkovich is accused of "gathering secret information" about a facility in the Sverdlovsk region that produced and repaired military equipment, the Prosecutor General's office said in a statement, revealing for the first time the details of the accusations against the jailed reporter. Gershkovich has been charged with espionage.


The officials didn't provide any evidence to back up the accusations.


Gershkovich was detained while on a reporting trip to Yekaterinburg in March 2023 and accused of spying for the U.S. The Federal Security Service, or FSB, alleged at the time he was acting on U.S. orders to collect state secrets but also provided no evidence. Washington designated him as wrongfully detained.


He was the first U.S. journalist taken into custody on espionage charges since Nicholas Daniloff in 1986 at the height of the Cold War. Gershkovich's arrest shocked foreign journalists in Russia, even though the country had enacted increasingly repressive laws on freedom of speech after sending troops into Ukraine.

## Unanimous Supreme Court preserves access to widely used abortion medication

date: 2024-06-13, from: San Jose Mercury News

The Supreme Court has preserved access to a medication used in nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the U.S. last year. It&#8217;s the court&#8217;s first abortion decision since conservative justices overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago. The justices ruled Thursday abortion opponents lacked the legal right to sue over the federal Food and Drug Administration&#8217;s approval of the medication, mifepristone, and the FDA&#8217;s subsequent actions to ease access to it. The case had threatened to restrict access to mifepristone across the country, including in states where abortion remains legal. The Biden administration and New York-based manufacturer Danco Laboratories argued mifepristone is among the safest drugs the FDA has ever approved.

## Biden, G7 leaders focus on Ukraine, Gaza, global infrastructure, Africa

date: 2024-06-13, from: VOA News USA

BORGO EGNAZIA, ITALY — U.S. President Joe Biden is in Apuglia, Italy, meeting with leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy democracies Thursday, aiming to address global economic security amid wars in Europe and the Middle East and U.S. rivalry with China.


The G7 leaders arrived at the luxury resort of Borgo Egnazia, the summit venue, welcomed by Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. Meloni’s hard-right party took nearly 29% of the vote in last weekend’s European Parliament election, making her the only leader of a major Western European country to emerge from the ballots stronger.


Meanwhile Biden is dealing with a contentious reelection campaign against Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump, and a personal ordeal. On Tuesday, a day before departing for the summit, his son, Hunter, was found guilty on federal charges for possessing a gun while being addicted to drugs.


Still, Biden came to the summit hoping to convince the group to provide a $50 billion loan to Ukraine using interest from Russian frozen assets, and deal with Chinese overcapacity in strategic green technologies, including electric vehicles. 


The European Union signaled their support by announcing duties on Chinese EVs a day ahead of the summit, a move that echoed the Biden administration’s steep tariff hike on Chinese EVs and other key sectors in May.


Biden is also lending his support to key themes in Meloni’s presidency – investing in Africa, international development, and climate change. Those topics were covered in the opening session of the G7 on Thursday, followed by discussions on the Gaza and Ukraine wars. 


Gaza cease-fire


With cease-fire negotiations at a critical juncture, Biden could face tough questions from leaders on whether he is doing enough to pressure Israel to pause its military campaign, reduce civilian casualties and provide more aid for Palestinians.


Leaders are “focused on one thing overall; getting a cease-fire in place and getting the hostages home as part of that,” White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told VOA as he spoke to reporters on board Air Force One en route to Italy. Biden has “their full backing,” Sullivan added.


Leaders will also discuss increasing tension along the Israeli border with Lebanon, Sullivan told reporters Thursday morning. 


“They'll compare notes on the continuing threat posed by Iran both with respect to its support for proxy forces and with respect to the Iranian nuclear program,” he added.


While the group has thrown its weight behind the cease-fire, G7 members are split on other Gaza-related issues, including the International Criminal Court's decision last month to seek arrest warrants for the leaders of Hamas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.


The United States denounced the court’s decision, and Britain called it “unhelpful.” France said it supports the court’s “fight against impunity,” while Berlin said it would arrest Netanyahu on German soil should a warrant is released.


Sullivan dismissed a United Nations inquiry result released Wednesday that alleges both Israel and Hamas committed war crimes and grave violations of international law.


“We’ve made our position clear,” he told VOA, referring to a review published in April by the State Department concluding that Israel’s campaign did not violate international humanitarian law.


Russian assets


Biden is pushing G7 leaders to provide Kyiv with a loan of up to $50 billion that will be paid back to Western allies using interest income from the $280 billion Russian assets frozen in Western financial institutions, estimated at $3 billion a year, for 10 years or more.


The goal is a leaders declaration at the end of the summit, a “framework that is not generic, that is quite specific in terms of what it would entail,” Sullivan told VOA Wednesday. Core operational details would still need to be worked out, he added. 


In April, Biden signed legislation to seize the roughly $5 billion in Russian assets that had been immobilized in U.S. financial institutions. The bulk of the money, though, $190 billion, is in Belgium, and much of the rest is in France and Germany.


“There's a tension here between a Biden administration ambition on an issue in which they do not have the final say, hitting against very staunch European fiscal conservatism and simply the mechanics of, how do you get something done in Europe in the week of European [parliamentary] elections,” Kristine Berzina, managing director of Geostrategy North at the German Marshall Fund think tank, told VOA.


Attending the summit for the second consecutive year, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is advocating for the deal to pass. He and Biden will sign a separate bilateral security agreement outlining U.S. support for Ukraine and speak in a joint press conference Thursday evening.


From Italy, Zelenskyy heads to Switzerland for a Ukraine peace conference over the weekend.


Africa, climate change and development


Meloni, a far-right politician who once called for a naval blockade to prevent African migrants from crossing the Mediterranean Sea to Europe, now wants to achieve the goal by bolstering international investments to the continent.


Most of the nearly 261,000 migrants who crossed the Mediterranean Sea from northern Africa in 2023 entered Europe through Italy, according to the United Nations.


She has aligned her G7 presidency with this agenda, and the group is set to release a statement on providing debt relief for low- and middle-income countries, dealing with irregular migration and calling for more investments in Africa.


The G7 statement will reflect the Nairobi/Washington vision that Biden signed with Kenyan President William Ruto, Sullivan said.


Meloni invited several African leaders as observers to the G7 meeting, including Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Tunisia's Kais Saied, Kenyan President William Ruto and Mohamed Ould Ghazouani, the president of Mauritania. The invitation follows the first Italy-Africa summit in Rome in January, where Meloni launched her investment initiative called the Mattei Plan for Africa.


The Mattei Plan has been integrated into the G7’s Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, which aims to mobilize $600 billion private infrastructure funding by 2027 as an alternative to Chin's Belt and Road initiative.


On climate change, the G7 has an uphill climb. None of the group’s members are on track to meet their existing emission reduction targets for 2030 to align with the Paris Agreement goal, according to data compiled by Climate Analytics.

## The disappearance — and reimagination — of the gay bar

<p>Gay bars are often a fixture of queer nightlife and can help foster a sense of community. Yet across the country, gay bars have shuttered at an alarming pace, down around 45% between 2002 and 2023. But queer nightlife isn&#8217;t disappearing — it may just be evolving. We&#8217;ll hear more. But first: Interest rates are staying where they are, so where do we go from here?</p>

## Microsoft Refused to Fix Flaw Years Before SolarWinds Hack

<p>[<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/microsoft-solarwinds-golden-saml-data-breach-russian-hackers">Renee Dudley at ProPublica</a>]</p><blockquote><p>"Former [Microsoft] employee says software giant dismissed his warnings about a critical flaw because it feared losing government business. Russian hackers later used the weakness to breach the National Nuclear Security Administration, among others."</p></blockquote><p>This is a damning story about profit over principles: Microsoft failed to close a major security flaw that left the government (alongside other customers) vulnerable because it wanted to win their business. This directly paved the way for <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/16/985439655/a-worst-nightmare-cyberattack-the-untold-story-of-the-solarwinds-hack">the SolarWinds hack</a>.</p><p>This doesn't seem to have been covert or subtext at Microsoft:</p><blockquote><p>"Morowczynski told Harris that his approach could also undermine the company’s chances of getting one of the largest government computing contracts in U.S. history, which would be formally announced the next year. Internally, Nadella had made clear that Microsoft needed a piece of this multibillion-dollar deal with the Pentagon if it wanted to have a future in selling cloud services, Harris and other former employees said."</p></blockquote><p>But publicly it said something very different:</p><blockquote><p>"From the moment the hack surfaced, Microsoft insisted it was blameless. Microsoft President Brad Smith assured Congress in 2021 that “there was no vulnerability in any Microsoft product or service that was exploited” in SolarWinds."</p></blockquote><p>It will be interesting to see what the fallout of this disclosure is, and whether Microsoft and other companies might be forced behave differently in the future. This story represents business as usual, and without external pressure, it's likely that nothing will change.</p>

## There’s Gold in That There Battery Waste

date: 2024-06-13, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjQ0ODQ0MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NTgyMjYzN30.d4roWxagaWGNlMudn_pePP_5QfMRyHsgye4cpwTv3NM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>Every year, millions of tons of sodium sulfate waste are generated throughout the lithium-ion battery supply chain. And although the chemical compound seems relatively innocuous — it looks just like table salt and is not particularly toxic — the sheer amount that’s produced via mining, cathode production, and battery recycling is a problem. Dumping it in rivers or oceans would obviously be disruptive to ecosystems (although that’s generally what happens in China), and with landfills running short on space, there are fewer options there, as well. </p><p>That is where Aepnus Technology is attempting to come in. The startup emerged from stealth today with $8 million in seed funding led by Clean Energy Ventures and supported by a number of other cleantech investors, including Lowercarbon Capital and Voyager Ventures. The company uses a novel electrolysis process to convert sodium sulfate waste into sodium hydroxide and sulfuric acid, which are themselves essential chemicals for battery production. </p><p>“It's a fully circular approach,” Bilen Akuzum, Aepnus’ co-founder and CTO, told me. “Rather than in the current paradigm where companies are buying chemicals and having to deal with disposing of the waste, we can co-locate with them and they give us the waste, and we give them back the chemicals.” This recycling process, he says, can happen an indefinite number of times. </p><p>Akuzum told me that companies using Aepnus’ tech can “speed up their environmental permits because they're not going to be producing that waste anymore. Instead, they can just turn it into value.” In an ideal scenario, this could increase domestic production of critical minerals and battery components, which will decrease the U.S.’s reliance on China, a major goal of the Biden administration. On-site chemicals production will also help to decarbonize the supply chain, as it eliminates the need for these substances to be trucked into remote mining sites or out to battery manufacturing and recycling facilities.</p><p>To do the chemical recycling, Aepnus has developed an electrolysis system that it says is 50% more efficient than the processes normally used to produce sodium hydroxide, and is uniquely tailored to process sodium sulfate waste. Energy nerds might associate electrolysis with the pricey production of green hydrogen, but this has actually always been the process by which sodium hydroxide is made. </p><p>Making sulfuric acid, however, doesn’t traditionally involve electrolysis, but because sodium hydroxide is the more valuable of the two chemicals, combining their production via a single, more efficient electrochemical process gives Aepnus a much better chance at being cost competitive with other chemical producers than, say, the likelihood of green hydrogen being cost competitive with natural gas. Akuzum told me that the company’s electrolyzers can operate at lower voltages and higher temperatures than the industry standard, thereby increasing efficiency, and don’t require rare earth elements, thereby reducing costs. </p><p>Ultimately, Akuzum said that Aepnus aims to become an electrolyzer manufacturer rather than a chemicals producer. “We just want to be the technology provider and almost like application agnostic in a sense that this [the battery industry] is just the first market that we're going after,” Akuzum told me, citing a number of other potential markets such as textile and pigment manufacturing, which also produce sodium sulfate waste.</p><p>The company is currently working to get initial customers onboard for pilot demonstrations, which are planned to take place over the next 18 months. In the extended near term, Aepnus wants to expand its platform to produce a greater variety of chemicals. As the tech scales and is deployed across various industries, the company says it has potential to mitigate a total of 3 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions between now and 2050, as calculated by Clean Energy Ventures’ <a href="https://cleanenergyventures.com/simple-emissions-reduction-calculator/%09https://cleanenergyventures.com/simple-emissions-reduction-calculator/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Simple Emissions Reduction Calculator</u></a>. </p>

## India beats US at cricket's Twenty20 World Cup

date: 2024-06-13, from: VOA News USA

WESTBURY, New York — There was no upset this time for the United States as the home team was easily beaten by cricket heavyweight India at the Twenty20 World Cup on Wednesday.


Suryakumar Yadav's half-century powered India to a seven-wicket win over the U.S., which had shocked Pakistan last week.


With the win, India reached the Super 8 round. The U.S. can advance by beating Ireland on Friday.


In a later match at Brian Lara Stadium in Trinidad, Sherfane Rutherford scored an unbeaten 68 from 39 deliveries to help the West Indies in their great escape — the co-hosts beat New Zealand by 13 runs.


The Caribbean lineup, 149-9 in its 20 overs, was 76-7 before its Rutherford-led recovery. Alzarri Joseph snared four New Zealand wickets and Gudakesh Motie took three — including New Zealand captain Kane Williamson for 1 — to restrict the Black Caps to 136-9 in reply.


On Long Island, Yadvav's 50 runs came off 49 balls and included two boundaries and two sixes. He put on 72 runs off 65 balls in an unbeaten fourth-wicket stand with Shivam Dube, who scored 31 not out as India finished with 111-3 in 18.2 overs in reply to 110-8 by the United States.


Left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh returned figures of 4-9 — including two wickets in the first over — to restrict the co-hosts after India had won the toss and opted to field at the Nassau County International Stadium.




India was in early trouble in its chase as Indian-born medium pacer Saurabh Netravalkar continued his golden run for the Americans.


After bowling the co-hosts to the upset over Pakistan, he celebrated the wickets of Indian superstars Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli.


Kohli was caught behind for a golden duck — dismissed off the first delivery he faced — in what surely will become a career highlight for Netravalkar. Sharma (3) fell to a slower delivery as Netravalkar finished with 2-18 in four overs.


Rishabh Pant scored 18 off 20 balls batting at No. 3 before he was bowled by Ali Khan delivery. With India struggling at 39-3 in 7.3 overs, the U.S. team momentarily raised visions of an even bigger shock.


West Indies advanceLeft-hander Rutherford turned the home team's fortunes around, going to the crease with the West Indies reeling at 22-4 after 5.4 overs. Rutherford scored 18 off the last over that culminated with a six and a boundary.


The loss left New Zealand with a strong possibility it will not make the second round. If Afghanistan beats Papua New Guinea on Thursday, three-time runner-up New Zealand will be out of contention.


For most of the first half of the game, the Black Caps were on top.


But Rutherford went on the attack as the West Indies added 58-2 in the last five overs of their innings.


He was 15 off 14 deliveries when star allrounder Andre Russell was out for 14 in the 13th over, and he accelerated with the lower-order in a counter-attacking, 72-minute innings containing six sixes and two boundaries.


"It's a good feeling, to help my team. That is what we live for and work hard for," man-of-the-match Rutherford said during the innings break. "It was a very tough surface to start on. I think 149 is a brilliant score on this wicket."


After the match, Rutherford had a more optimistic tone: "It is only the start of something big to come and hopefully we can keep winning and momentum going."


New Zealand started well after winning the toss and fielding, with Trent Boult (3-16) bowling opener Johnson Charles to end the first over.


Tim Southee (2-21), recalled after missing New Zealand's opening loss to Afghanistan, dismissed dangerman Nicholas Pooran for 12 in the fourth over, trigging a run of three wickets for three runs.


Lockie Ferguson deceived Roston Chase with a slower ball to make it 21-3 and skipper Rovman Powell (1) was caught behind off Southee five balls later.


Russell went on the attack but his dismissal — caught in the deep of Boult's bowling — appeared to be an insurmountable setback until Rutherford took up the challenge.


"The quality of Sherfane's innings was high," New Zealand skipper Williamson said. "The batting depth in their side was beneficial for sure. We cannot make excuses and have to find ways."

## Anti-Muslim hate groups in US surge back into spotlight

date: 2024-06-13, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Once seemingly fading into obscurity, anti-Muslim hate groups in the United States have surged back into the spotlight in recent months, reinvigorated by the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.


Many of these groups, such as Jihad Watch and ACT for America, emerged in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. and thrived on public fears of terrorism. But as those fears waned in recent years, so did the groups’ sway. Some disbanded, while others gravitated to other hot-button issues.


From a peak of 114 in 2017, their number dropped to a mere 34 last year, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit that tracks hate groups.


In early 2023, "Islamophobia was down to a slow trickle," SPLC senior research analyst Caleb Kieffer said.


Then came the October 7 Hamas assault on Israel, which claimed about 1,200 lives and triggered a massive Israeli military response in Gaza.


Anti-Muslim groups that had "opportunistically" seized on divisive issues, such as critical race theory and LGBTQ-inclusive policies, swung back into action.


"These anti-Muslim groups went right back to their core messaging," Kieffer said in an interview with VOA. "They've been going hard on the rhetoric since October last year."


Take ACT for America. Founded in 2007 by Brigitte Gabriel, a Lebanese American political activist and self-described "survivor of terrorism," it grew into one of the country's leading anti-Muslim organizations.


At its peak, the group had more than 50 active chapters, each counted as a separate hate group by the SPLC. But in recent years, most of those chapters either shut down or shifted into other areas, leaving ACT for America with just eight on SPLC’s most recent list.


According to the SPLC, ACT for America embraced a "nativist tone" before October 7, circulating, among other things, a petition calling to "Stop the Taxpayer Funded Border Invasion."


After October 7, the group launched another petition more in line with its agenda and with a call by former U.S. President Donald Trump to stop admitting Palestinian refugees from Gaza.


Warning her followers about homegrown jihadi terror, Gabriel, a staunch Trump supporter, began peddling her bestselling anti-Muslim book, Because They Hate: A Survivor of Islamic Terror Warns America, in exchange for a $25 donation.


In a video titled "Wake Up America" in October, she claimed, "Hamas has a large network of cells spreading all across America," from Laurel, Maryland, to Tucson, Arizona.


Other groups that had also latched onto contentious issues similarly pivoted back to their core agenda.




Jihad Watch, a website run by prominent anti-Muslim figure Robert Spencer, published an article last October claiming, "We’re in a war between savages and civilization. Everything else is a detail."


Eight days later, an affiliated political website called FrontPage Magazine ran a piece titled "It's Islam, Stupid," arguing that everything Hamas did "has been done by Muslims throughout history and is still being practiced today.''


FrontPage Magazine is published by the David Horowitz Freedom Center, another leading anti-Muslim group. Jihad Watch is a project of the center.


ACT for America, Jihad Watch and the David Horowitz Freedom Center are part of what experts describe as a well-funded, close-knit anti-Muslim industry, with each group playing a distinct role in the ecosystem.


With chapters across the country, Washington-based ACT for America provides the "grassroots muscle" to the movement, Kieffer said. The Center for Security Policy serves as its think tank, he said.


The SPLC-designated groups appear on other hate lists. Several SPLC-branded groups contacted by VOA condemned their designation.


In a statement to VOA, a spokesperson for ACT for America rejected the "anti-Muslim" label, saying the organization has "always welcomed and included members of all faiths," including Muslims, and hosted Muslim keynote speakers at its conferences.


ACT for America works "on a broad range of issues, none of which are anti-Muslim," the spokesperson said.  "As a matter of fact, since the defeat of ISIS and al-Qaida between 2018 and 2024, you didn't hear a blurb from ACT for America about radical Islam."


In response to a VOA query, Jihad Watch's Spencer accused the SPLC of smearing and defaming "organizations that oppose its far-left political agenda by lumping them in with the likes of the KKK and neo-Nazis."


In a brief interview with VOA, J. Michael Waller, a senior analyst for strategy at the Center for Security Policy, called the designation "slander," saying it was tied to his group's criticism of the Iranian government and the Muslim Brotherhood.


Kieffer defended the SPLC's methodology, saying it only designates groups that "vilify" and "demonize" people because of their race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity.


The SPLC defines anti-Muslim hate groups as organizations that "broadly defame Islam and traffic in conspiracy theories of Muslims being a subversive threat to the nation."


Not every anti-Muslim hate group has stood the test of time. In recent years, dozens of ACT for America chapters have closed.


The ACT for America spokesperson said most of its member groups have "turned into digital chapters meeting via zoom or other technology platforms."


Last year, an anti-refugee and anti-Muslim blog called Refugee Resettlement Watch became inactive and was dropped from SPLC's list of hate groups.


Another well-known anti-Muslim group called Understanding the Threat announced last year it was shutting down. The group was operated by a former FBI agent known for spreading anti-Muslim conspiracy theories.


Other groups have rebranded. One former ACT for America chapter now operates as AlertAmerica.News, according to SPLC. Its focus ranges from "strengthening national security" to "fighting communism and American Marxism."


Kieffer said while the group's central focus may have shifted away from Islamophobia, it continues to invite well-known, anti-Muslim speakers to its events.


With the war in Gaza still raging, the resurgence in Islamophobia remains unabated, Kieffer said. But that's likely to change in the run-up to the presidential election in November.


"I imagine that we're going to slowly see a decline again as these groups start to push other issues," he said.


Brian Levin, a criminologist and hate crime researcher, noted that anti-Muslim hate crimes have surged in recent years, even as the number of hate groups has dwindled.


That's because hatred has found a new home in the mainstream, rendering niche groups such as Islamophobic outfits increasingly obsolete, he said.


"The bottom line is, the way we associate to express and amplify hatred has changed," Levin said in an interview with VOA. "Up-and-coming bigots of all sorts will find an array of xenophobic bigotry and conspiracism within general mainstream platforms."

## Biden arrives at G7 in Italy with sanctions for Russia, support for Ukraine, but no deal on Gaza

date: 2024-06-13, from: VOA News USA

Brindisi, Italy — U.S. President Joe Biden arrived in Brindisi, Italy, late Wednesday ahead of his meeting with leaders of the Group of Seven industrialized democracies.


He came armed with fresh sanctions for Russia, a new bilateral security agreement for Ukraine, but no breakthrough on Gaza cease-fire negotiations that now sit at a critical juncture.


The United States is working with mediators Egypt and Qatar after reviewing Hamas’ response to the proposal, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Italy early Wednesday.


"Many of the proposed changes are minor and not unanticipated," he said. "Others differ quite substantively from what was outlined in the U.N. Security Council resolution."


As Biden was in flight to Italy, the U.S. Treasury Department announced fresh sanctions that target foreign individuals and companies aiding Moscow's military industrial base. They include companies based in China, that are selling semiconductors to Russia.


It includes an expansion of secondary sanctions that allow the United States to blacklist any bank around the world that does business with Russian financial institutions already facing sanctions. The goal is to prevent smaller banks in China and other countries from funding the Russian war effort.


The sanctions also target networks Russia uses to obtain critical materials for building aerial drones, anti-drone equipment, industrial machinery and for the country's chemical and biological weapons program, the Treasury Department said.


"We are increasing the risk for financial institutions dealing with Russia’s war economy and eliminating paths for evasion, and diminishing Russia’s ability to benefit from access to foreign technology, equipment, software, and IT services," Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement.


The Moscow Exchange, Russia’s top financial marketplace, announced it was halting trading of dollars and euros after being listed in the new sanctions.


Biden is also set to sign on Thursday a bilateral security agreement with Ukraine during his meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The agreement is intended to show U.S. resolve to strengthen Ukraine's defense and deterrence capabilities without committing American troops on the Ukrainian battlefield. The agreement would include Ukrainian commitment to reform and on end-use monitoring of U.S.-provided weapons.


It will be Biden’s second meeting with Zelenskyy in the span of days; the two met in Paris on the sidelines of the 80-year commemoration of D-Day last week.


Russian frozen assets


Zelenskyy will be urging G7 leaders to get behind Biden’s plan to provide Kyiv with a loan of up to $50 billion for Ukraine’s war efforts against Russia, amid Moscow’s strategic advances in the battlefield. The U.S. proposal would pay back Western allies using interest income from the $280 billion in Russian assets frozen in Western financial institutions, estimated at $3 billion a year, for 10 years or more.


The goal is a Leaders’ Declaration at the end of the summit, a "framework that is not generic, that is quite specific in terms of what it would entail," Sullivan told VOA as he spoke to reporters in flight. However, "core operational details" would still need to be worked out. It’s unclear whether the loan will be provided by the G7 or only some of its members.


In April, Biden signed legislation to seize the roughly $5 billion in Russian assets that had been immobilized in U.S. financial institutions. But the bulk of the money, $190 billion, is in Belgium and much of the rest, is in France and Germany.


A big source of concern for Europeans is who will be responsible to cover losses should interest rates fall below expectations or if the sanctions that immobilize the funds are not renewed. Russia considers the immobilizing of its assets following its invasion on Ukraine as theft and has threatened retaliation.


Although Ukraine is not a G7 member, this is the second consecutive year Zelenskyy is attending the summit. From Italy, he heads to Switzerland for a Ukraine peace conference over the weekend.


EU puts tariffs on Chinese EVs


Biden imposed a drastic tariff hike in May to confront what he calls Chinese overcapacity in strategic green technologies and has been urging the G7 to do the same.


On Wednesday, the European Union responded to the call by announcing it would slap Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) with higher tariffs, up to 38.1%, saying the imports benefit "heavily from unfair subsidies" and pose a "threat of economic injury" to producers in Europe.


U.S. tariffs on Chinese EVs were quadrupled to a 100% rate, while solar cell and semiconductor import tariffs were doubled to 50%. The rates on certain steel and aluminum imports were tripled to 25%. The additional duties covered $18 billion in Chinese products.


Europe is taking action to address Chinese overcapacity just as the United States has done, Sullivan said. A "common framework" on how to deal with various economic security issues posed by China will likely be included in the G7 final communique, he added.


The punitive moves could prompt retaliation from Beijing, which accuses the West of hyping overcapacity claims to blunt China’s competitive edge.


Biden arrived on the global forum after a family drama. On Tuesday, a day before departing for the summit, his son Hunter Biden was found guilty on federal charges of possessing of a gun while being addicted to drugs.


Biden has said he would not use presidential powers to pardon his son. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to respond to further questions, including the possibility of commuting Hunter Biden’s sentence when it is given by the judge.

## US voices support for South Korean ‘balloon war’ efforts

date: 2024-06-13, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The U.S. expressed its support for providing outside information to the people of North Korea even as attempts are made in South Korea to block leaflet campaigns aimed at sending information to the North.


Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have been rising in recent weeks due to tit-for-tat exchanges between Pyongyang and Seoul over balloons they both have been sending across the inter-Korean border.


Responding to an inquiry by VOA’s Korean Service, a State Department spokesperson said on Monday that "it is critical for the people of North Korea to have access to independent information not controlled by the DPRK regime."


"We continue to promote the free flow of information into, out of, and within the DPRK," continued the spokesperson, referring to North Korea by its official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.


"We continue to urge North Korea to reduce tensions and cease any actions that could increase the risk of conflict," the spokesperson added.


North Korea, listed by Human Rights Watch among "the most repressive countries in the world," considers outside information a threat to the ruling regime’s survival and denies its people access to information.


The government heavily controls all forms of media and cracks down on people distributing, watching or listening to any South Korean cultural content.


In what it said was a response to South Korean activists sending balloons carrying leaflets into the North, Pyongyang has floated more than 1,600 balloons filled with trash and waste into South Korea since May 28.


In response, Seoul on June 4 fully suspended an inter-Korean military deal made in 2018 and resumed loudspeaker broadcasts at the border Sunday before halting them the following day.


The South Korean balloons, sent aloft by human rights activists, have carried leaflets conveying information about the outside world and the North Korean regime. They also carried thumb drives containing K-pop songs and dramas.


But the effort has caused controversy in South Korea, where attempts are being made to halt the campaign.




In September 2023, the South Korean constitutional court struck down a law banning the sending of leaflets to North Korea, saying it violated the constitutional right to freedom of expression.


Nevertheless, the opposition Democratic Party of Korea is attempting to apply other existing laws to block the campaign.


The opposition party, preferring engagement with North Korea, has been opposed to sending leaflets to North Korea. The anti-leaflet law was passed in December 2020 by the liberal party of former President Moon Jae-in six months after North Korea, expressing discontentment over leaflet activities, blew up an inter-Korean liaison office in Kaesong, a town in North Korea near the border.


On Tuesday, Lee Jae-myung, the leader of the party, called leaflet activities "illegal under the current law."


In June 2020, Lee, the then-governor of Gyeonggi Province, declared five cities in the province as "danger zones" under the Framework Act on the Management of Disasters and Safety. Gyeonggi Province borders North Korea.


Lee then issued an administrative order banning people from entering the areas to launch balloons.


Kim Dong-yeon, from the opposition party and the current governor of Gyeonggi Province, said on Wednesday a consideration is being made to declare some areas in the province "danger zones" to "prevent the launch of propaganda leaflets in accordance with related laws."


He said he will "immediately dispatch provincial police to potential leaflet sites to bolster patrols and surveillance," according to South Korea’s liberal daily Hankyore.


Questions have been raised in South Korea whether the police can stop leaflet-sending activities based on the Act on the Performance of Duties by Police Officers, according to Seoul-based news agency Yonhap. The act allows police to restrain people from causing damage to property or harm other people.




Yoon Hee-keun, National Police Agency commissioner, told reporters Monday that the leaflet campaigns cannot be blocked on the basis of that law.


He said this is because it is "unclear whether the trash-carrying balloons" sent by North Korea "would constitute an urgent and grave threat to the lives and bodies of the public, which is prerequisite for restricting them under the law."


David Maxwell, vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy, told VOA on Tuesday via email that Seoul is "complying with the 2014 U.N. Commission of Inquiry that calls on people around the world to call out North Korea for its human rights abuses, one of which is the isolation of the people and the denial of all information going into the North."


Bruce Klingner, senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, said, "The North Korean balloons are government actions and thus a violation of the armistice," whereas balloons from the South are sent by non-government organizations.


Robert Rapson, who served as charge d’affaires and deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul in 2018-21, said while Seoul’s "decision to pause loudspeaker broadcasts" is "a positive step toward de-escalation, it should go further by also pausing balloon launches from the South."

## Calm Company Fund is taking a break

Find the space between… Calm Company Fund is going on sabbatical and taking a break from investing in new companies and raising new funds. Here’s why."</p></blockquote><p>Calm Company Fund's model seems interesting. It's a revenue-based investor that makes a return based on its portfolio companies' earnings, but still uses a traditional VC model to derive its operating budget. That means it makes a very small percentage of funds committed from Limited Partners, rather than sharing in the success of its portfolio (at least until much later, when the companies begin to earn out).</p><p>That would make sense in a world where the funds committed were enormous, but revenue-based investment tends to raise smaller fund sizes. So Calm Company Fund had enough money to pay for basically one person - and although the portfolio was growing, the staff size couldn't scale up to cope.</p><p>So what does an alternative look like? I imagine that it might look like taking a larger percentage of incoming revenue as if it were an LP itself. Or maybe this kind of funding simply doesn't work with a hands-on firm, and the models that attract larger institutional investors are inherently more viable (even if that isn't always reflected in their fund returns). </p><p>I want something like this to exist, but the truth is that it might live in the realm of boring old business loans, and venture likely is able to exist <em>because</em> of the risks involved in those sorts of companies.</p>

## Chrome OS switching to the Android Linux kernel and related Android subsystems

date: 2024-06-12, from: OS News

Surprisingly quietly, in the middle of Apple&#8217;s WWDC, Google&#8217;s ChromeOS team has made a rather massive announcement that seems to be staying a bit under the radar. Google is announcing today that it is replacing many of ChromeOS&#8217; current relatively standard Linux-based subsystems with the comparable subsystems from Android. To continue rolling out new Google AI features to users at a faster and even larger scale, we’ll be embracing portions of the Android stack, like the Android Linux kernel and Android frameworks, as part of the foundation of ChromeOS. We already have a strong history of collaboration, with Android apps available on ChromeOS and the start of unifying our Bluetooth stacks as of ChromeOS 122. ↫ Prajakta Gudadhe and Alexander Kuscher on the Chromium blog The benefits to Google here are obvious: instead of developing and maintaining two variants of the Linux kernel and various related subsystems, they now only have to focus on one, saving money and time. It will also make it easier for both platforms to benefit from new features and bugfixes, which should benefit users of both platforms quite a bit. As mentioned in the snippet, the first major subsystem in ChromeOS to be replaced by its Android counterpart is Bluetooth. ChromeOS was using the BlueZ Bluetooth stack, the same one used by most (all?) Linux distributions today, which was initially developed by Qualcomm, but has now switched over to using Fluoride, the one from Android. According to Google, Fluoride has a number of benefits over BlueZ. It runs almost entirely in userspace, as opposed to BlueZ, where more than 50% of the code resides in the kernel. In addition, Fluoride is written in Rust, and Google claims it has a simpler architecture, making it easier to perform testing. Google also highlights that Fluoride has a far larger userbase &#8211; i.e., all Android users &#8211; which also presents a number of benefits. Google performed internal tests to measure the improvements as a result from switching ChromeOS from BlueZ to Fluoride, and the test results speak for themselves &#8211; pairing is faster, pairing fails less often, and reconnecting an already paired device fails less often. With Bluetooth being a rather problematic technology to use, any improvements to the user experience are welcome. At the end of Google&#8217;s detailed blog post about the switch to Fluoride, the company notes that it intends for the project as whole &#8211; which is called Project Floss &#8211; to be a standalone open source project, capable of running on any Linux distribution. ↫ Russ Lindsay, Abhishek Pandit-Subedi, Alain Michaud, and Loic Wei Yu Neng on the chromeOS dev website We aspire to position Project Floss as a standalone open source project that can reach beyond the walls of Google’s own operating system in a way where we can maximize the overall value and agility of the larger Bluetooth ecosystem. We also intend to support the Linux community as a whole with the goal that Floss can easily run on most Linux distributions. If Fluoride can indeed deliver tangible, measurable benefits in Bluetooth performance on Linux desktops, I have no doubt quite a few distributions will be more than willing to switch over. Bluetooth is used a lot, and if Fedora, Ubuntu, Arch, and so on, can improve the Bluetooth experience by switching over, I&#8217;m pretty sure they will, or at least consider doing so.

## Arm, Qualcomm legal battle seen disrupting AI-powered PC wave

date: 2024-06-12, from: OS News

The new Windows on ARM Copilot+ PC thing, running on Qualcomm&#8217;s Snapdragon X Elite and Pro chips, isn&#8217;t even out the door yet, and we&#8217;re already dealing with legal proceedings. But the main conversation among conference attendees was over how a contract dispute between Arm Holdings and Qualcomm, which work together to make the chips powering these new laptops, could abruptly halt the shipment of new PCs that industry leaders expect will make Microsoft and its partners billions of dollars. ↫ Max A. Cherney at Reuters The basic gist of the story is as follows. Qualcomm acquired a company named Nuvia, founded by former Apple processor engineers, in order to gain new technology to build its Snapdragon X Elite and Pro chips. Nuvia was planning on developing ARM chips for servers, but after the acquisition, Qualcomm changed their plans and repurposed their technology for use in laptops &#8211; the new X chips. ARM claims that Nuvia was only granted a license for server use, and not laptop use. Qualcomm, meanwhile, argued that it has a broad license to use ARM for pretty much anything, and as such, that any possible restrictions Nuvia had are irrelevant. While this all sounds like very rich corporations having a silly legal slapfight, it could have real consequences. If the legal case goes very, very wrong for Qualcomm, it could halt the sale of devices powered by the Snapdragon X chips well before they&#8217;re even shipping. I doubt it&#8217;ll get that far &#8211; it rarely does, and there&#8217;s some big names and big reputations at play here &#8211; but it does highlight the absurdity of how the ARM ecosystem works. Speaking of the ARM ecosystem, Qualcomm isn&#8217;t the only ARM chip makers dying to break into the PC market. Qualcomm currently has a weird exclusivity agreement with Microsoft where it&#8217;s the only ARM chip supplier for PCs, but that agreement is running out soon. Another player that&#8217;s ready to storm this market once that happens is MediaTek, who is also developing a chip geared towards Microsoft&#8217;s Copilot+ specifications, with a release target of 2025. Let&#8217;s hope MediaTek will be as forthcoming with Linux support as Qualcomm surprisingly has been, but I have my sincerest doubt.

## US House holds attorney general in contempt for withholding Biden audio

date: 2024-06-12, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The House voted Wednesday to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over audio of President Joe Biden's interview in his classified documents case, Republicans' latest and strongest rebuke of the Justice Department as partisan conflict over the rule of law animates the 2024 presidential campaign.


The 216-207 vote fell along party lines, with Republicans coalescing behind the contempt effort despite reservations among some of the party's more centrist members. Only one Republican — Rep. David Joyce of Ohio — voted against it.


Garland said in a statement late Wednesday, "It is deeply disappointing that this House of Representatives has turned a serious congressional authority into a partisan weapon. Today's vote disregards the constitutional separation of powers, the Justice Department's need to protect its investigations, and the substantial amount of information we have provided to the Committees."


He added, "I will always stand up for this Department, its employees, and its vital mission to defend our democracy."


Garland is now the third attorney general to be held in contempt of Congress. Yet it is unlikely that the Justice Department — which Garland oversees — will prosecute him. The White House's decision to exert executive privilege over the audio recording, shielding it from Congress, would make it exceedingly difficult to make a criminal case against Garland.


Nonetheless, Speaker Mike Johnson defended the decision to push ahead with what is now a mostly symbolic effort.


"Look, we did our job on the contempt, and I think it sends an important message," the Louisiana Republican said following the vote. "We'll see what happens next, but, I mean, the House has to do its work and I'm pleased with the outcome today."




The White House and congressional Democrats have slammed Republicans' motives for pursuing contempt and dismissed their efforts to obtain the audio as purely political. They also pointed out that Rep. Jim Jordan, the Republican chair of the House Judiciary Committee, defied his own congressional subpoena last session.


Garland has defended the Justice Department, saying officials have gone to extraordinary lengths to provide information to the committees about Special Counsel Robert Hur's classified documents investigation, including a transcript of Biden's interview with him.


"There have been a series of unprecedented and frankly unfounded attacks on the Justice Department," Garland said in a press conference last month. "This request, this effort to use contempt as a method of obtaining our sensitive law enforcement files is just most recent."


Republicans were incensed when Hur declined to prosecute Biden over his handling of classified documents and quickly opened an investigation. Republican lawmakers — led by Jordan and Rep. James Comer — sent a subpoena for audio of Hur's interviews with Biden during the spring. But the Justice Department only turned over some of the records, leaving out audio of the interview with the president.


On the last day to comply with the Republicans' subpoena for the audio, the White House blocked the release by invoking executive privilege. It said that Republicans in Congress only wanted the recordings "to chop them up" and use them for political purposes.


Executive privilege gives presidents the right to keep information from the courts, Congress and the public to protect the confidentiality of decision-making, though it can be challenged in court.


Administrations of both political parties have long held the position that officials who assert a president's claim of executive privilege can't be prosecuted for contempt of Congress, a Justice Department official told Republicans last month.


Hur spent a year investigating the president's improper retention of classified documents, from his time as a senator and as vice president. The result was a 345-page report that questioned Biden's age and mental competence but recommended no criminal charges for the 81-year-old. Hur said he found insufficient evidence to successfully prosecute a case in court.


In March, Hur stood by his no-prosecution assessment in testimony before the Judiciary Committee, where he was grilled for more than four hours by both Democratic and Republican lawmakers.


His defense did not satisfy Republicans, who insist that there is a politically motivated double standard at the Justice Department, which is prosecuting former President Donald Trump over his retention of classified documents at his Florida club after he left the White House.


But there are major differences between the two probes. Biden's team returned the documents after they were discovered, and the president cooperated with the investigation by voluntarily sitting for an interview and consenting to searches of his homes.


Trump, by contrast, is accused of enlisting the help of aides and lawyers to conceal the documents from the government and of seeking to have potentially incriminating evidence destroyed.

## Linus Torvalds: extensible scheduler “sched_ext” in Linux 6.11

date: 2024-06-12, from: OS News

The extensible scheduler &#8220;sched_ext&#8221; code has proven quite versatile for opening up better Linux gaming performance, more quickly prototyping new scheduler changes, Ubuntu/Canonical has been evaluating it for pursuing a more micro-kernel like design, and many other interesting approaches with it. Yet it&#8217;s remained out of tree but that is now changing with the upcoming Linux 6.11 cycle. Linus Torvalds as the benevolent dictator for life &#8220;BDFL&#8221; of the Linux kernel announced he intends to merge the sched_ext patches for Linux 6.11 even though there has been some objections by other kernel developers. Torvalds feels the sched_ext code is ready enough and provides real value to the mainline Linux kernel. It&#8217;s not worth dragging out sched_ext continuing to be out-of-tree. ↫ Michael Larabel at Phoronix I haven&#8217;t felt the need to mess around with the Linux scheduler in a long, long time &#8211; I have some vague memories of perhaps well over a decade ago where opting for a different scheduler could lead to better desktop-focused performance characteristics, but the details in my brain are so fuzzy that it may just be a fabricated or confabulated memory.

## Microsoft pulls release preview build of Windows 11 24H2 after Recall controversy

date: 2024-06-12, from: OS News

Microsoft recently announced some big changes to the Recall feature in Windows, and now it&#8217;s pulled the Release Preview version which contained Recall entirely. It&#8217;s likely not a coincidence that Microsoft also quietly pulled the build of the Windows 11 24H2 update that it had been testing in its Release Preview channel for Windows Insiders. It&#8217;s not unheard of for Microsoft to stop distributing a beta build of Windows after releasing it, but the Release Preview channel is typically the last stop for a Windows update before a wider release. ↫ Andrew Cunningham at Ars Technica The company doesn&#8217;t actually mention why the release was pulled, but the reason is pretty obvious if you connect the dots. I&#8217;m at least glad Microsoft is taking the complaints seriously, and while I don&#8217;t personally think Recall is a good idea, if a user gives their consent and uses it knowingly and willingly, I don&#8217;t see any problems with it.

## What 2 Years of High Interest Rates Have Done to Clean Energy

date: 2024-06-12, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjQ0MjM4OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0ODM1MDk3NH0.L4OMRkbF15YrODCVsxIdUlR8fZ6bHpJIfE2Gyb-OfpM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	Are interest rates going to go down? The market will have to wait.
</p><p>
	Following a Tuesday report showing steady consumer prices in May and prices overall only rising 3.3% in the past year, the Federal Reserve held steady on interest rates, releasing a projection Wednesday showing just one rate cut this year.
</p><p>
	If rates do indeed fall this year (or next, when the Fed is projecting four cuts), that would be a big relief to renewable developers. There’s been an unprecedented flow of money into the sector in the past few years — whether from tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act or power purchase agreements from utilities and corporations that want to decarbonize, you name it — but it’s come at the same time as projects have gotten more expensive to undertake. That’s in terms of labor and supplies, but also the most important part of any project: money.
</p><p>
	“In the near term, investors are looking for market rates to fall to reduce financing costs — the Fed cutting the base rate could greatly help this along,” Srinivasan Santhakumar, senior research analyst at Wood Mackenzie, told me in an email.
</p><p>
	Interest rates don’t affect every project equally. Renewables tend to be capital intensive, meaning that a higher portion of their costs are in building them as opposed to operating them. For an offshore wind turbine project, almost 70% of the expenditure comes from capital, whereas with a combined-cycle natural gas turbine plant it’s less than 20%, according to Wood Mackenzie data.
</p><p>
	That’s because, in the case of wind and solar, the “fuel” is free, unlike with natural gas and other fossil-based energy sources. This means that developers have to fund more of the project upfront with borrowed money, which means a bigger hit from higher interest rates. <a href="https://www.lazard.com/media/xemfey0k/lazards-lcoeplus-june-2024-_vf.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>According to an analysis by the investment bank Lazard</u></a>, when the cost of debt is 5%, the levelized cost of an offshore wind project is $88 per megawatt-hour; when the cost of debt rises to 8%, the levelized cost rises to $118. For a combined cycle gas plant, the levelized cost per megawatt-hour rises from $66 to just $76.
</p><p>
	“You’re really sensitive to interest rates” as a renewable developer, as Tim Latimer, the chief executive officer of the geothermal startup Fervo, explained to me. “That’s a big investment up front.”
</p><p>
	In some sense, renewables economics have been a victim of their own success, Latimer said. Because there are lots of buyers for 15 years’ worth of renewable electricity and no risk of fuel costs surging or falling dramatically, the “spread” that renewable projects demand over risk-free rates is much smaller than for natural gas projects. But that means as rates rise, the spread shrinks more with renewables. “That has a much bigger relative impact on the economics,” Latimer said.
</p><p>
	Geothermal projects have similar economics to other renewables, Latimer said, and being able to sell power to offtakers has helped protect the finances of Fervo’s projects.
</p><p>
	Democratic Senators Sheldon Whitehouse and Elizabeth Warren <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/letters/warren-whitehouse-to-federal-reserve-chair-powell-high-interest-rates-are-blocking-clean-energy-progress-increasing-energy-costs#:~:text=%E2%80%9CYour%20decision%20to%20rapidly%20raise,economic%20benefits%20from%20these%20projects." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>have pressed Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell</u></a> on the high rates, citing the effect on renewable investments. “Your decision to rapidly raise interest rates beginning in 2022, and the potential that they may remain too high for too long, has halted advances in deploying renewable energy technologies and delayed significant climate and economic benefits from these projects,” the two wrote in a letter to Powell in March.
</p><p>
	Executives from some of the world’s biggest renewables companies have been singing this song, as well. “Renewable energy in general is very, very susceptible to rising interest rates and offshore wind, even the most of all of the renewable energy sectors because it's so capital intensive. Our fuel is free, we say, but our fuel is really the cost of capital because we put so much capital out upfront,” Orsted Americas chief executive officer David Hardy <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/understanding-the-horrible-year-for-us-offshore-wind?sref=vuYGislZ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told </u><u><em><em>Bloomberg</em></em></u></a>.
</p><p>
<a href="https://orstedcdn.azureedge.net/-/media/www/docs/corp/com/investor/transcript-orsted-q1-2024.pdf?rev=495c827f8bc243e2bf80be49f8deab44&hash=308B0FC775D7AA1FDFB6918CB15F1532" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>In a May earnings call</u></a>, Orsted’s global chief executive, Mads Nipper, told investors, “It’s impossible to say whether [costs] have peaked yet, and on the way down, as that will hinge, very much, on the macroeconomic factors, and the rates, specifically.”
</p><p>
	The premium renewables can yield over government debt has shrunk dramatically since 2020, BloombergNEF analyst Atin Jain said. In response, developers have increased prices for power purchase agreements, knowing that they can do so thanks to the demand for their clean electrons. But that also means more expensive power when the deals are struck, and in the case of several offshore wind projects in the Northeast, price increases can sometimes mean the deals never get done at all, even in spite of generous IRA tax credits.
</p><p>
	 “Higher interest rates are driving up project costs and [power purchase agreement] costs as well,” explained Michael Arndt, the president of Recurrent Energy, at a forum hosted by the American Council on Renewable Energy. “Being able to bring in more tax equity is a big offset to a higher interest rate environment.”
</p><p>
	According to BNEF data, developers have tried to shorten the term of their borrowing, aiming to avoid getting locked into higher rates for a long time, while also going to the bond market for financing as opposed to bank loans, which typically means paying a lower rate. This then advantages longer tenured and more established developers who are better able to access the bond market. As Esper Nemi, the chief financial officer of the green energy giant Brookfield Renewable Partners, said in a May earnings call, “Our access to scale capital means we can execute on large opportunities where there are fewer viable partners and risk adjusted returns can therefore be very attractive.”
</p><p>“Where possible, if you’re a creditworthy issuer and you’re more financially stable and have the ability to make regular interest payments, you have been viewed attractively by the bond market,” Jain told me. Bond issuance by utilities and renewable developers has more than doubled since before the pandemic, according to BNEF data. “That’s how people are navigating this environment: cutting loan tenors, doubling down on bonds. Everyone is hoping that though they have to tap more expensive debt now they’ll be able to refinance those loans,” Jain said.
</p><p>
	How many people will be able refinance remains to be seen. “Developers with deeper balance sheets are able to navigate this a little bit better than smaller or midsize companies,” Jain added.
</p><p>
Latimer said that higher rates could be particularly challenging to first of a kind projects. Investors have a return they want a new project to generate and that figure moves up with interest rates.</p><p>“The return hurdle that you need to hit to entice capital that views your project as a new development and new technology moves up with interest rates,” Latimer told me. “Your project economics have to be that much better relative to what your baseline was before because everyone has higher return expectations.”

## US Federal Reserve sees inflation progress but envisions only one rate cut this year

date: 2024-06-12, from: VOA News USA

washington — Federal Reserve officials said Wednesday that inflation has fallen further toward their target level in recent months but signaled they expect to cut their benchmark interest rate just once this year. 


The policymakers' forecast for one rate cut was down from a previous forecast of three, because inflation, despite having cooled in the past two months, remains persistently elevated. 


In a statement issued after its two-day meeting, the Fed said the economy is growing at a solid pace, while hiring has "remained strong." The officials also noted that in recent months there has been "modest" further progress toward their 2% inflation target. That is a more positive assessment than after the Fed's previous meeting May 1, when the officials had noted a lack of progress. 


Still, the central bank made clear Wednesday that further improvement is needed. 


"We'll need to see more good data to bolster our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%," Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference after the Fed meeting ended. 


As expected, the policymakers kept their key rate unchanged at roughly 5.3%. The benchmark rate has remained at that level since July of last year, after the Fed raised it 11 times to try to slow borrowing and spending and cool inflation. Fed rate cuts would, over time, lighten loan costs for consumers, who have faced punishingly high rates for mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other forms of borrowing. 


The officials' rate-cut forecast reflects the individual estimates of 19 policymakers. The Fed said eight of the officials projected two rate cuts. Seven projected one cut. Four of the policymakers envisioned no cuts at all this year. 


"What everyone agrees on," Powell said at his news conference, is that the Fed's timetable for rate cuts is "going to be data dependent." 


The Fed's latest projections are by no means fixed. The policymakers frequently revise their plans for rate cuts — or hikes — depending on how economic growth and inflation evolve over time. 


On Wednesday morning, the government reported that inflation eased in May for a second straight month, a hopeful sign that an acceleration of prices that occurred early this year may have passed. Consumer prices excluding volatile food and energy costs — the closely watched "core" index — rose just 0.2% from April, the smallest rise since October. Measured from a year earlier, core prices climbed 3.4%, the mildest pace in three years. 


"We welcome today's reading and hope for more like that," Powell said. 


Though inflation has tumbled from a peak of 9.1% two years ago, it remains too high for the Fed's liking. The policymakers now face the delicate task of keeping rates high enough to slow spending and defeat high inflation without derailing the economy.

## The Stephen Miller of Climate Policy

He is not without his hobbyhorses — wind turbines <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/15/why-trump-hates-wind-turbines/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>are ugly bird-killers</u></a>; it’s freezing in New York, <a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/326781792340299776" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>so where the hell is global warming?</u></a> — but on the whole, I tend to agree with the assessment that he basically<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51213003" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u> believes “nothing” on climate change</u></a>. Trump simply isn’t all that interested. He prefers to let the others do the thinking for him.</p><p>This isn’t a knock on Trump, per se; part of leading a bureaucracy as big and as complicated as the United States government is surrounding yourself with people who can offload some of that thinking for you. But the crucial question then becomes: <em><em>Who is doing that thinking? </em></em></p><p>The answer, to a large extent, is Russ Vought.</p><p>The name might not immediately ring a bell. Biographical <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CREC-2010-07-29/html/CREC-2010-07-29-pt1-PgE1465-2.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>details</u></a> of the 48-year-old career bureaucrat can be hard to find (“a native of Trumbull, Connecticut,” “the youngest of seven children,” “a die-hard Yankees fan”), giving the impression that Vought came out of nowhere. In a sense, he did: For years, Vought <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-qn_ArKlU4&ab_channel=TheKevinRobertsShow" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>dealt mainly with spreadsheets</u></a> as he worked first as a budget staffer for Texas Republican Sen. Phil Gramm and Rep. Jeb Hensarling, then later for then-Rep. Mike Pence, and eventually the Heritage Foundation. It was Gramm, though, who gave Vought his outlook on the world: “If you do budget, you do everything.”</p><p>After a stint with the Trump transition team, Vought became deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget in 2018, and took over entirely in 2019. At OMB, he famously held up military aid to Ukraine in what became the subject of <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-seek-question-trump-budget-chief-ukraine-impeachment/story?id=66274613" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Trump’s first impeachment</u></a>. Described as “ideological in the extreme,” “adversarial” with his colleagues, and having an “<a href="https://unherd.com/2024/02/russell-vought-americas-false-christian-nationalist-king/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>aggressive personal style</u></a>” — incongruous, perhaps, with his somewhat nerdy, bespectacled appearance — Vought would reportedly go too far in proposed budget cuts sometimes <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2023/02/19/russ-vought-republican-debt-ceiling-strategy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>even for his boss</u></a>.</p><p>After Biden’s win in 2020, Vought launched the Center for American Restoration, a pro-Trump think tank with the mission of renewing “a consensus of America as a nation under God,” and has otherwise kept busy with appearances on conservative-friendly talk shows on One America News Network and Fox News. Steve Bannon has approvingly <a href="https://x.com/gc22gc/status/1799555162631245840" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>dubbed</u></a> him “MAGA’s bulldog,” though he rarely speaks to the mainstream press. (I received a failed delivery message in response to an email to the address listed on the website for the Center for American Restoration; other attempts to contact Vought went unanswered.) </p><p>Vought is all but assured to take up a powerful position in a potential incoming Trump cabinet. He “trained up during the first Trump administration, and he is looking to apply those skills that he learned in a second,” said Alex Witt, the senior advisor for oil and gas at Climate Power, a strategic communications group that shared its research on Vought with me.</p><p>Vought may not be the most obvious architect for the project of dismantling climate progress, however. In Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self"><u>roadmap for the next Republican president</u></a>, Vought authored the chapter on the Office of the President of the United States — hardly the most climate-y section, given that there are also chapters on reforming the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy, and the Department of the Interior. A <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-doubles-down-on-plan-for-huge-spending-power-grab.html#/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>flurry</u></a> of <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/opinion-russ-vought-most-dangerous-101226877.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>new</u></a> articles about Vought describe him as <a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/06/10/donald-man-to-make-america-a-great-christian-nation-has-even-bigger-plans/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a Christian nationalist crusader</u></a> preoccupied with fending off <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/06/08/russ-vought-trump-second-term-radical-constitutional/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>big government</u></a> and orchestrating an expansion of presidential powers. </p><p>But just as Trump advisor Stephen Miller shaped far-right immigration policies from behind the scenes, Vought would be a hidden hand in a future administration dismantling climate progress. In his chapter in Project 2025, for example, Vought proposes moving the National Defense Strategy from under the purview of the Defense Department to the White House and its National Security Council — normal “expansion of presidential powers” stuff. But Vought goes even further, directing the NSC then to “rigorously review” the staff with an eye for “climate change … and other polarizing policies that weaken our armed force.” </p><p>Erin Sikorsky, the director of the Center for Climate and Security, told me that such a proposal indicates “a misunderstanding of how connected climate hazards are to the core duties of what the military is focused on.” It could also put the U.S. armed forces on the back foot in conflicts around the world if it’s followed through. As just one example, if the military isn’t engaging with its Indo-Pacific partners “and helping those countries build resilience to climate change, then China is more than happy to step in and address that,” Sikorsky warned. At home, NSC <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/21/fact-sheet-prioritizing-climate-in-foreign-policy-and-national-security/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>analyses of the domestic impacts</u></a> of climate change will likely come to a halt, scuttling future coordination between the military and local governments after disasters and hampering mitigation efforts around the country.</p><p>The most significant blow on the climate front, however, would come from Vought’s proposal to reinstate Schedule F, a job classification that aims to convert at least <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/how-trump-loyalists-could-make-the-president-even-more-powerful-607353cc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>50,000 </u></a>career civil servants to “at-will” political employees. (Trump used an executive order to implement Schedule F at the <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-creating-schedule-f-excepted-service/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>very end</u></a> of his term; President Biden unimplemented it soon after taking office.) The employment classification ostensibly aims to make it easier to replace <a href="https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2023/03/trump-vows-shatter-deep-state-revive-schedule-f-and-move-more-agencies-out-dc/384266/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>“rogue” or “woke” civil servants</u></a> and would-be whistleblowers, a.k.a. “the deep state,” with party-line faithful. But in the words of Vought himself, Schedule F is <em><em>also</em></em> necessary because Biden’s “climate fanaticism will need a whole-of-government unwinding.”</p><p>The effects of such a decision, experts told me, could range from very bad to disastrous self-sabotage. Schedule F is “designed to be a tool to purge federal agencies of nonpartisan experts” and replace them with “partisan loyalists who would willingly follow any order without question, regardless of whether it was legal, constitutional, or the right thing to do for the people,” Joe Spielberger, the policy counsel at the Project on Government Oversight, an independent and nonpartisan watchdog group, told me. In practice, that might mean firing longtime civil servants perceived as not loyal enough, or even just “creating and perpetuating a climate of fear and intimidation where people are not able or willing to speak out when they see abuse of power and other corruption happening.”</p><p>Such a scenario is concerning for employees at agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who work on climate modeling. But the expertise of the U.S. civil service is broad and deep; Schedule F could impact everyone from the economists, lawyers, and engineers who work on something like the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards to the <a href="https://legal-planet.org/2024/01/24/election-2024-trump-plans-to-drain-the-epa/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>people</u></a> who sit on the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee.</p><p>“Civil service positions are not classified as political appointees for a reason, which is so that staff, <em><em>especially scientists</em></em>, can do work that spans administrations because it is so fundamental to public health and welfare,” Chitra Kumar, the Union of Concerned Scientists’ managing director for climate and energy, told me in an email. The people made fireable under Schedule F, in other words, are the ones who actually know what is going on, whereas “elected officials come and go, often taking a year or more to understand the latest underlying science.”</p><p>Reimplementing and expanding Schedule F, however, is apparently one of Vought’s greatest ambitions. Earlier this year, the National Treasury Employees Union obtained documents via a Freedom of Information Act request that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/02/28/trump-plan-omb-schedule-f-nteu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>showed</u></a> Vought’s intent to apply the status to much of OMB’s workforce in 2020. As justification for taking an implicit machete to his staff, Vought writes in Project 2025 that “it is the president’s agenda that should matter to the departments and agencies that operate under his constitutional authority,” but that instead, the U.S. civil service is “all too often … carrying out its own policy plans and preferences — or, worse yet, the policy plans and preferences of a radical, supposedly ‘woke’ faction of the country.”</p><p>Ann Carlson, the former acting administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and a professor of environmental law at UCLA, strongly refutes Vought’s claim. For one thing, she told me that the great irony of the Schedule F proposal is that it would make it <em><em>more difficult</em></em> for the Trump administration to carry out its goals in the long run. </p><p>“Part of the problem for a conservative administration is, if you want to roll back policies that are in place, you need people who know how to do that,” Carlson pointed out. She also bristled at the suggestion that civil servants are unable to check their biases at the door: Carlson’s team at NHTSA helped put together <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/biden-tailpipe-power-plant-emissions" target="_self"><u>the Biden administration’s rules</u></a> to strengthen fuel economy standards, but it also worked to roll back the Obama administration’s regulations and replaced them with <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/trump-administration-announces-one-national-program-rule-federal-preemption-state-fuel#:~:text=A%20top%20priority%20for%20President,that%20meet%20their%20families'%20needs." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the SAFE standards</u></a> under Trump. “I don’t actually know, for most of them, which one they preferred,” Carlson said.</p><p>Carlson wasn’t the only former political appointee I spoke with who fiercely defended the integrity of her staff. Ron Sanders, a three-year Trump appointee, so vehemently opposed Schedule F when it was briefly implemented in 2020 that <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/trump-appointee-quits-over-executive-order/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he resigned</u></a> as chairman of the Federal Salary Council. Today, he represents a group of Republican former national security officials who are <a href="https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2024/06/bush-era-national-security-officials-warn-against-schedule-f/397186/?oref=govexec_news_alert_nl&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=GovExec%20Alert:%20June%206%2C%202024&utm_term=newsletter_ge_alert" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>imploring Congress</u></a> to find a middle ground between the current status quo and the extreme political loyalty demanded by Schedule F.</p><p>When I read Sanders the part of Vought’s Project 2025 chapter that calls for weeding out the “radical, supposedly ‘woke’ faction of the country,” he told me that such thinking is “myopic.” “This is potentially a Republican administration coming in and finding ‘Democrats’ in place,” Sanders said. “You could say the same thing about the Biden administration, but they knew better — they knew that senior career officials appointed in the Trump administration are still politically neutral. It just happened to be a matter of timing.”</p><p>It likewise struck me as curious that Vought would push so hard for a policy that would not only hamstring the Trump administration but might also allow future Democratic presidents to carry out purges of perceived <em><em>conservative </em></em>government operatives.</p><p>The Biden administration has made moves to <a href="https://www.federaltimes.com/management/career/2024/04/04/biden-finalizes-rule-to-prevent-return-of-schedule-f/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>prevent Schedule F</u></a> from potentially returning under a different president. Still, Spielberger from the Project on Government Oversight told me that short of a legislative fix by Congress, such actions will only delay reimplementation of the policy by “a matter of months” should Trump be reelected. The damage to climate science from four years of Schedule F, however, could be drastic.</p><p>“What we’re going to end up with is an executive branch that’s just uninformed,” Daniel Farber, the director of the Center for Law, Energy, and the Environment at the University of California, Berkeley, stressed to me. Farber’s fear is not just that “a bunch of uninformed ideologues” would be running the show, but also that once government experts are kicked out, it will be difficult to replace them or entice them to return.</p><p>“Even after we go back to a Democratic president, you can’t wave a wand and get all those people back,” Farber said. In the first nine months of the Trump administration, for example, the EPA <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/brain-drain-at-the-epa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>lost more than 700 employees</u></a> — and that was due to poor morale and high turnover even <em><em>without</em></em> the threat of Schedule F.</p><p>Schedule F doesn’t just chase <em><em>out</em></em> climate-related experts from the government. It also accelerates the revolving door that allows anti-climate zealots actors <em><em>in</em></em>. Both the Heritage Foundation and Vought’s think tank, the Center for American Restoration, have taken money from Big Oil groups and executives. Trump has already made his own <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/09/trump-oil-industry-campaign-money/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>transactional assurances</u></a> to the industry if it funds his return to the White House. Schedule F, meanwhile, would open up hundreds if not thousands of positions for unqualified political operatives — essentially creating a “<a href="https://www.citizensforethics.org/news/analysis/faq-the-conservative-attack-on-the-merit-based-civil-service/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>spoils system</u></a>” where the lines between government and private industry would blur more than they already do.</p><p>“Russ Vought is not the problem,” Witt, of Climate Power, told me. “The problem is Donald Trump: Donald and the GOP are bought out by Big Oil, and Vought and other bad actors are a cog in that machine.”</p><p>It’s a metaphor that works well for the federal government, too: What happens when you have 50,000 cogs, but the person you’ve deferred to run the machine has fired all the mechanics?</p><p>“You take out all that expertise, all the people who understand how the system works?” Carlson, the former NHTSA director, said. “Good luck to you.”</p>

## Celebrating failure

date: 2024-06-12, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>Biographies of great people, interviews with successful entrepreneurs, and podcast episodes with famous creators. The world doesn’t lack celebrations of greatness. It should be inspiring to hear from someone successful, it should motivate you to do more, to work harder, and to strive for greatness. But like many other good things in life, too much of it can be detrimental. You can ingest only so many success stories before starting to feel bad for not being one of them. It’s partly why social media mostly sucks. It’s performative. Everyone is showing the best parts of their lives while the shitty moments are kept private, away from public eyes.</p>
<p>Failure should be shared. Trying and failing at something should be celebrated. Not because of the failure itself but because that’s the only way to achieve something worthwhile. Failing is inevitable. Everyone has to go through it and confront it one way or another. It’s part of the process and it’s something we should be more upfront and open about it. And again, it should be celebrated.</p>
<p>Does anyone make a podcast with interviews with people who didn’t have success? To people who tried hard but ultimately failed? I’d love to listen to those stories.</p>                <hr>

## US inflation cooled in May in sign that price pressures may be easing

date: 2024-06-12, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Inflation in the United States eased in May for a second straight month, a hopeful sign that a pickup in prices that occurred early this year may have passed. The trend, if it holds, could move the Federal Reserve closer to cutting its benchmark interest rate from its 23-year peak.


Consumer prices excluding volatile food and energy costs — the closely watched "core" index — rose 0.2% from April to May, the government said Wednesday. That was down from 0.3% the previous month and was the smallest increase since October. Measured from a year earlier, core prices rose 3.4%, below last month's 3.6% increase.


Fed officials are scrutinizing each month's inflation data to assess their progress in their fight against rising prices. Even as overall inflation moderates, such necessities as groceries, rent and health care are much pricier than they were three years ago — a continuing source of public discontent and a political threat to President Joe Biden's re-election bid. Most other measures suggest that the economy is healthy: Unemployment remains low, hiring is robust and consumers are traveling, eating out and spending on entertainment.




Overall inflation also slowed last month, with consumer prices unchanged from April to May, in part because of sharp falls in the cost of gasoline, air fares and new cars. Measured from a year earlier, consumer prices rose 3.3%, less than the 3.6% increase a month earlier.


The cost of auto insurance, which has soared in recent months, actually dipped from April to May, though it's still up more than 20% from a year earlier. Grocery prices were unchanged last month, after declining slightly in April. They're now up just 1% on a year-over-year basis.


The Fed has kept its key rate unchanged for nearly a year after having rapidly raised it in 2022 and 2023 to fight the worst bout of inflation in four decades. Those higher rates have led, in turn, to more expensive mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other forms of consumer and business borrowing. Though inflation is now far below its peak of 9.1% in mid-2022, it remains above the Fed's target level.




Persistently elevated inflation has posed a vexing challenge for the Fed, which raises interest rates — or keeps them high — to try to slow borrowing and spending, cool the economy and ease the pace of price increases.


The longer the Fed keeps borrowing costs high, the more it risks weakening the economy too much and causing a recession. Yet if it cuts rates too soon, it risks reigniting inflation. Most of the policymakers have said they think their rate policies are slowing growth and should curb inflation over time.


Inflation had fallen steadily in the second half of last year, raising hopes that the Fed could pull off a "soft landing," whereby it manages to conquer inflation through higher interest rates without causing a recession. Such an outcome is difficult and rare.


But inflation came in unexpectedly high in the first three months of this year, delaying hoped-for Fed rate cuts and possibly imperiling a soft landing.


In early May, Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank needed more confidence that inflation was returning to its target before it would reduce its benchmark rate. Several Fed officials have said in recent weeks that they needed to see several consecutive months of lower inflation.


Some signs suggest that inflation will continue to cool in the coming months. Americans, particularly lower-income households, are pulling back on their spending. In response, several major retail and restaurant chains, including Walmart, Target, Walgreen's, McDonald's and Burger King, have responded by announcing price cuts or deals.

Flooding was reported across the southern part of Florida including Fort Myers, Miami, and even farther north. In Sarasota, just south of Tampa, nearly four inches of rain fell in an hour, a new record for the area, with total rainfall reaching about 10 inches on Tuesday.

N20 emissions rise, but HCFC levels fall</h3><p>Nitrous oxide doesn’t get as much attention as carbon dioxide or methane, but it should: This greenhouse gas is more potent than both, depletes the ozone, and is the third largest contributor to climate change, <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/agriculture-major-driver-of-rise-in-nitrous-oxide-emissions-over-past-40-years/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8kpgYWm_EHLWCDsajPP4M8TEd-kkGbQ979f4oWJR0HQtFG0AgoPTSD7MV5ldzXXumatrrk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> <em>Carbon Brief</em>.

Agriculture emissions of N20 were 67% higher in 2020 than they were in 1980. The concentration of N20 in the atmosphere is now 25% higher than in pre-industrial years. “The unfettered increase in a greenhouse gas with a global warming potential approximately 300 times larger than carbon dioxide, presents dire consequences for the planet,” the researchers said in a press release. </p><p>But it’s not all bad news.

Latest talks on climate finance goals end in stalemate</h3><p>UN climate finance talks in Bonn, Germany, ended on a sour note yesterday, “with negotiators from developing and developed countries blaming each other in fiery exchanges,” <a href="https://www.climatechangenews.com/2024/06/11/bonn-talks-on-climate-finance-goal-end-in-stalemate-on-numbers/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8kpgYWm_EHLWCDsajPP4M8TEd-kkGbQ979f4oWJR0HQtFG0AgoPTSD7MV5ldzXXumatrrk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> <em><em>Climate Home News</em></em>. The discussions were a lead-up to November’s COP29 in Azerbaijan, where countries are expected to put forward a new annual finance goal for helping vulnerable countries protect themselves from climate change and shift to clean energy. The current target, set in 2009, sits at $100 billion annually. Boosting this fund is seen as “<a href="https://www.climatechangenews.com/2024/04/25/tensions-rise-over-who-will-donate-to-new-climate-finance-goal/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8kpgYWm_EHLWCDsajPP4M8TEd-kkGbQ979f4oWJR0HQtFG0AgoPTSD7MV5ldzXXumatrrk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the most important decision</a>” expected to come out of this year’s climate summit. But so far, there has been little progress. Rich countries only managed to meet the existing $100 billion annual pledge in 2022, two years late.</p><h3>5. Rising sea levels threaten Greek island known as mythological birthplace of Apollo </h3><p>One of the most important sites in Greek and Roman mythology is sinking into the sea as climate change causes water levels to rise. The tiny abandoned Greek island of Delos, in the Aegean Sea, was first settled in the third millennium BC and was once a busy port city with 30,000 occupants. In Greek mythology, it was the birthplace of Apollo and his sister Artemis. Today it is dotted with 2,000-year-old archaeological ruins and has been a UNESCO World Heritage site since 1990. But sea levels around the island have risen 66 feet in just 10 years, and archaeologists <a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-06-ancient-greek-sanctuary-slowly-aegean.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8kpgYWm_EHLWCDsajPP4M8TEd-kkGbQ979f4oWJR0HQtFG0AgoPTSD7MV5ldzXXumatrrk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> <em><em>AFP</em></em> the ruins will disappear entirely in about 50 years, eaten away by encroaching sea water and rising temperatures.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

## US Rep. Nancy Mace overcomes McCarthy-backed challenger to win Republican primary in South Carolina

date: 2024-06-12, from: VOA News USA

COLUMBIA, S.C.  — U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace has won the Republican nomination after a tumultuous second term in South Carolina that saw her go from a critic to an ally of former President Donald Trump and make headlines for plenty of things off the House floor. 


Mace defeated challengers Catherine Templeton and Bill Young in voting that ended Tuesday. She will face a Democratic opponent in the general election in the 1st District, which is the closest thing South Carolina has to a swing district in the Republican-dominated state. 


Trump’s endorsement — after he called her crazy and terrible in 2022 — is just one of many ways Mace has attracted a spotlight far greater than a typical second-term member of Congress. 


She’s a regular on interview shows, often antagonizing the hosts. She calls for her party to moderate on abortion and marijuana but joined seven of the farthest right members to oust former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. 


McCarthy threw his weight against Mace and the other defectors. His political action committee gave a $10,000 contribution to Templeton, and the American Prosperity Alliance, where a McCarthy ally serves as a senior adviser, donated to a group called South Carolina Patriots PAC, which spent more than $2.1 million against Mace. 


Mace has said her positions and beliefs aren’t erratic — she is just reflecting the values of the 1st District, which stretches from the centuries-old neighborhoods of Charleston down the coast to Beaufort County’s booming freshly built neighborhoods of retirees moving to South Carolina from somewhere else. 


Mace, the first woman to graduate from South Carolina's military academy The Citadel, thanked her voters for tuning out the “senseless noise” from her opponents and realizing she is unafraid to stand up to powerful people. 


“When you are the first woman to sit in The Citadel’s barber chair to get all of your hair chopped off, you don’t get your feelings hurt when you don’t get invited to the fancy cocktail parties in Washington, D.C.,” Mace said. “While sometimes I may be a caucus of one, I’m not alone because I’m not there for me — I’m there for each and every one of you.” 


Mace's opponents argued that by seeming to land everywhere on issues, Mace is nowhere. 


Templeton ran South Carolina’s health and environmental agency to some angst a decade ago and in her only political race finished third in the 2018 GOP gubernatorial primary won by Gov. Henry McMaster. Young is a Marine veteran and financial planner. 


Templeton didn't mention Mace's name, but asked Tuesday for her voters to keep backing Republicans. 


“I think it is safe to say everybody in here has the conservative values that we share, and in November we are all going to stand behind our president and we are all going to join together to support the Republican Party,” Templeton said. 


In the Democratic primary, businessman and former International African American Museum CEO Michael Moore defeated Mac Deford, a Citadel graduate and lawyer for a couple of the larger bedroom communities in the district. 


South Carolina lawmakers drew the district to be more Republican after the seat flipped for one term in 2018. The 1st District was the only congressional district won by Nikki Haley over Trump in the 2024 South Carolina Republican presidential primary. 


4th District  


For the second election in a row, U.S. Rep. William Timmons has fought off a spirited challenge in the Republican primary. 


Timmons defeated state Rep. Adam Morgan, the leader of the state House Freedom Caucus who argued Timmons was too liberal. 


Timmons’ divorce — and a widely shared Instagram post by a husband who said Timmons had an affair with his wife — complicated his reelection bid. Timmons has denied the allegations. 


Timmons has Trump's endorsement as he seeks a fourth term in the district anchored by Greenville and Spartanburg. 


Timmons was not in his district Tuesday night, instead staying in Washington, where Republicans only have a two vote majority in the U.S. House. 


He said he was thankful his voters recognized his strong conservative record and saw through the “countless lies” from his opponent.  


“In Washington I am focused on policy not headlines, on representing my constituents not myself, and working with my colleagues instead of working against them,” Timmons said in a statement on social media. 


In November’s general election, Timmons will face Democrat Kathryn Harvey, who helps nonprofit organizations with marketing, fundraising and leadership, and Constitutional Party candidate Mark Hackett. 


3rd District  


South Carolina's 3rd District is open after Republican Rep. Jeff Duncan decided not to run again after seven terms. Duncan's wife of 35 years filed for divorce in 2023, accusing him of several affairs. 


The Republican nomination is going to a runoff between a candidate endorsed by Trump and another endorsed by his good friend McMaster. 


Mark Burns is a Black pastor who has backed Trump since before his first race for president and made it to the runoff after losing twice before in the GOP primary in the neighboring 4th District. 


His opponent is nurse practitioner Sheri Biggs, who along with her husband have been faithful contributors and friends of McMaster for years. 


They defeated five other candidates including South Carolina Rep. Stewart Jones and Kevin Bishop, who handled communications for U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham for more than two decades. 


Sherwin-Williams paint store manager Byron Best from Greenwood won the Democratic nomination in the 3rd District. 


Other races  


The only other U.S. House incumbent facing a primary challenger is Republican Rep. Joe Wilson who won the party's nomination as he seeks a 12th full term in the 2nd District, which stretches from suburban areas around Columbia west and south toward Aiken. 


Wilson will face David Robinson II. The U.S. Army veteran who enlisted after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and is an advocate for missing people after his son disappeared in the desert in Arizona won the Democratic primary. 


Attorney Duke Buckner won the Republican 6th District primary and will face Democratic U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn, who is seeking a 17th term in the state's majority-minority district that is bounded by areas around Charleston, Beaufort and Columbia.


In the 7th District Democratic primary, teacher Mal Hyman, who calls himself an independent Democrat, faces Desert Storm and Iraqi Freedom veteran Daryl Scott. The winner takes on Republican U.S. Rep. Russel Fry, who is seeking a second term in the district that stretches from Myrtle Beach to Florence in the northeast part of the state.

## How to Fix Electricity Bills in America

	Have you looked at your power bill — like, 
	<em><em>really</em></em> looked at it? If you’re anything like Rob, you pay whatever number appears at the bottom every month and drop it in the recycling. But how everyone’s power bill is calculated — in wonk terms, the “electricity rate design” — turns out to be surprisingly important and could be a big driver of decarbonization.
</p><p>
	On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob and Jesse talk about why power bills matter, how Jesse would design electricity rates if he was king of the world, and how to fix rooftop solar in America. This is the finale of our recent series of episodes on rooftop solar and rate design. If you’d like to catch up, you can listen to our previous episodes featuring Sunrun CEO

	Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p><p><strong></strong></p><blockquote>
<strong>
	Robinson Meyer: </strong>There’s other issues we could talk about electricity rate design, and I want to come back to them in a second. But let’s say you were made Grand Vizier of all public utility commissions across the country. How would you fix this? Like, what do we need to do?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>I think there’s basically two options that we have, here — and this is, you know, a reflection of the fact that there is no one unified electricity market structure in the U.S. We have a bunch of different ways that we do things. And so I’ll just sketch two kind of classic examples of that. There are lots of little gradations in between.<br/>
<br/>
One is a kind of traditional regulated market where you get your power from a regulated or publicly owned utility, like a municipal utility, or a rural utility district, or an investor-owned utility. It’s regulated by the state, and you buy power at whatever the regulated rate is. And so, if that’s the case, we need to get those rates right. And by that I mean: There are multiple things you’re paying for when you’re paying for your bill. You’re paying for the actual energy you’re consuming, and that is a kind of volumetric thing — you know, you should pay more the more you consume, all else equal.
	<br/>
<br/>
But the interesting feature of electricity pricing is that it varies from hour to hour because of the fact that demand is changing all the time and renewable energy availability is changing all the time. And so the actual marginal cost of generating electricity depends on this intersection of how much you demand and what the available supply is. And if you have a lot of cheap renewables, for example, flooding the grid, that price could be very low. It could even be zero — when you’re curtailing solar or wind, you have excess free power, effectively. And at other times it can be very expensive when you’re running diesel generators or inefficient gas turbines to meet this sort of peak demand requirements. Electricity prices could be several hundred dollars a megawatt-hour.
	<br/>
<br/>
And so we have a very wide range of pricing and we don’t communicate that at all to people today. And I think we have to restore that, in some way — to let people understand that if you consume more energy during the middle of the day when there’s lots of solar available, even if you don’t have solar on your roof, it’s coming from your neighbor or utility-scale solar farm far away, that’s the cheapest, best time to consume electricity. And if you’re consuming when fossil power plants are producing expensive power, you should think about how to reduce that consumption. So it’s really important that we get that kind of time dynamic rate right for the energy component.
	<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>So you would expose people to prices. I mean, that’s kind of your basic answer is that you would expose people to these time-of-day prices even if — and I just want to be clear, here. You’re talking about folks who live in Washington, D.C., who live in New York, who live in Philadelphia, who live in San Francisco, who live in Atlanta …<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>All over. Yeah, everywhere.

<p>HighGo Software is pleased to announce the first GitHub community release of wal2mongo v1.0.7, which can be used to replicate PostgreSQL database changes to an output format that can be directly fed into the mongo client tool to achieve logical replication between PostgreSQl and MongoDB.
