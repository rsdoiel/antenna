id="safari-already-contains-ad-tracking-technology-and-theyre-now-adding-it-to-safaris-private-browsing-mode-too">Safari
already contains ad tracking technology, and they’re now adding it to
Safari’s Private Browsing mode, too</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>We’ve been talking a lot about sleazy ways in which the online
advertising industry is conspiring with browser makers – who also happen
to be in the online advertising industry – to weaken privacy features so
they can still track you and the ads they serve you, but with “privacy”.
They’re trying really hard to make it seem as if they’re doing us a huge
favour by making tracking slightly more private, and browser makers are
falling over themselves to convince us that allowing some user and ad
tracking is the only way to stop the kind of total everything,
everywhere, all at once tracking we have now. We’ve got Google and
Chrome pushing something called “Privacy Sandbox“, and we’ve got Mozilla
and Facebook pushing something called “Privacy-Preserving Attribution“,
both of which are designed to give the advertising industry slightly
more private tracking in the desperate hope they won’t still be doing a
lot more tracking on the side. Safari users, meanwhile, have been
feeling pretty good about all of this in the knowledge Apple cares about
privacy, so surely Safari won’t be doing any of this. You know where
this is going, right? Today, the WebKit project published a lengthy blog
post detailing all the various additional measures it’s taking to make
its Private Browsing mode more, well, private, and a lot of them are
great moves, very welcome, and ensure that private browsing on Safari is
a little bit more private than it is on Chrome, as the blog post
gleefully points out. However, not long into the blog post, the shoe
drops. We also expanded Web AdAttributionKit (formerly Private Click
Measurement) as a replacement for tracking parameters in URL to help
developers understand the performance of their marketing campaigns even
under Private Browsing. ↫ John Wilander, Charlie Wolfe, Matthew Finkel,
Wenson Hsieh, and Keith Holleman A little further down, they go into
more detail: Web AdAttributionKit (formerly Private Click Measurement)
is a way for advertisers, websites, and apps to implement ad attribution
and click measurement in a privacy-preserving way. You can read more
about it here. Alongside the new suite of enhanced privacy protections
in Private Browsing, Safari also brings a version of Web
AdAttributionKit to Private Browsing. This allows click measurement and
attribution to continue working in a privacy-preserving manner. ↫ John
Wilander, Charlie Wolfe, Matthew Finkel, Wenson Hsieh, and Keith
Holleman So not only does Safari already include the kind of tracking
technology everyone is – rightfully – attacking Mozilla over for adding
it to Firefox, Apple and the Safari team are actually taking it a step
further and making this ad tracking technology available in private
browsing mode. The technology is limited a bit more in Private Browsing
mode, but its intent is preserved: to track you and the ads you see
online. I would hazard a guess that when you enable a browser’s private
browsing or incognito mode, you assume that means zero tracking. We
already know that Chrome’s Incognito mode leaks data like a sieve with
bullet holes in it, and now it seems Safari’s Private Browsing mode,
too, is going to allow advertisers to track you and the ads you see –
blog post full of fancy privacy features be damned. Do you know those
“Around the web” chumboxes? Even if you’re unfamiliar with the term,
you’ve most definitely seen these things all over the web, and really
hate them. A major player in the chumbox business is a company called
Taboola, a name that’s quite despised and reviled online. Popular Apple
blogger John Gruber called Taboola a “slumlord” and the “lowest common
denominator clickbait property“. Do you want to know which major
technology company just signed a massive deal with Taboola? Ad tech
giant Taboola has struck a deal with Apple to power native advertising
within the Apple News and Apple Stocks apps, Taboola founder and CEO
Adam Singolda told Axios. ↫ Sara Fischer at Axios Apple needs to find
new markets to keep growing, and clearly, pestering its users with
upsells and subscriptions to its services isn’t enough. The online
advertising industry is massive – just look at Google’s and Facebook’s
financial disclosures – and Apple seems to be interested in taking a
bigger slice of that fat pie. And as Google and now Mozilla are finding
out, a browser that blocks ads and ad tracking kind of gets in the way
of that. Anyone who can make and sell plug-and-play Pi-Hole devices even
normal people can use is going to make a killing.</p>

<h2 id="wind-is-more-powerful-than-j.-d.-vance-seems-to-think">Wind Is
More Powerful Than J. D. Vance Seems to Think</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-16, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjgxNTcyOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NzE2ODY3MH0.HECkh5vg6nNF1KdLXxDnWEuDWnPTxfUaCGQtvDGHZ6o/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
It’s a good thing most of us aren’t accountable for every single silly
thing we’ve ever said, but most of us are not vice presidential running
mates, either. Back in 2022, when J.D. Vance was still just a
“<em><em>New York Times</em></em> bestselling author” and not yet a
“junior senator from Ohio,” much less “second-in-line to a former
president who will turn 80 in office if he’s reelected,” he made a
climate oopsie that — now that
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/climate/jd-vance-climate-change.html#:~:text=Referring%20to%20environmentalists,a%20cellphone%20on%3F%E2%80%9D" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it’s
recirculating</a> — deserves to be addressed.
</p>
<p>
If Democrats “care so much about climate change,” Vance argued during an
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/LrBGXUIhdog?feature=shared&t=7733" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Ohio
Republican senator candidate forum</u></a> during that year, “and they
think climate change is caused by carbon emissions, then why is their
solution to scream about it at the top of their lungs, send a bunch of
our jobs to China, and then manufacture these ridiculous ugly windmills
all over Ohio farms that don’t produce enough electricity to run a cell
phone?”
</p>
<p>
Vance is hardly the first person to get confused about intermittent
energy sources such as wind; his new would-be boss, former President
Donald Trump, likes to claim that wind turbines can’t even power a
single household’s television. The fallacy stems from the idea that the
power will “go out” if the wind isn’t blowing — which, in theory, would
be true in <em><em>any</em></em> case where power demand outpaces
supply. But grids are regulated with
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/chart-what-will-a-net-zero-grid-energy-mix-actually-look-like" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>levels
of redundancy</u></a> specifically designed to prevent those sorts of
outages, Kyri Baker, an assistant professor of engineering at the
University of Colorado,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-wind-solar-fact-check#:~:text=%E2%80%9CRemember%20the%20windmills%3F" target="_self"><u>previously
explained to me</u></a>. There are also, of course,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/battery-hydrostor-nostromo-energy-vault" target="_self"><u>batteries</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Still, for the sake of argument: If the wind is blowing, could a turbine
“produce enough electricity to run a cell phone”? Even running at 42%
capacity —
<a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-many-homes-can-average-wind-turbine-power#:~:text=At%20a%2042%25%20capacity%20factor,than%20940%20average%20U.S.%20homes." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>typical
for turbines</u></a> circa when Vance was speaking — the average turbine
in the U.S. generates roughly 1,170 kilowatt-hours of electricity in 60
minutes, according to the
<a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-many-homes-can-average-wind-turbine-power#:~:text=At%20a%2042%25%20capacity%20factor,than%20940%20average%20U.S.%20homes." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>United
States Geological Survey</u></a>. Charging your phone twice daily for
365 days
<a href="https://www.energysage.com/electricity/house-watts/how-many-watts-does-a-phone-charger-use/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>amounts
to less than</u></a> 3.7 kilowatt-hours per <em><em>year</em></em>. In
other words, about the time it takes to watch an episode of
<em><em>Bridgerton</em></em>, a single wind turbine can generate enough
electricity to charge 244 phones each day twice over. So Vance is
<em><em>way</em></em> off here.
</p>
<p>
Are the windmills “ridiculous” and “ugly”? That’s more subjective, but
they’re certainly not being built “all over Ohio farms.” Wind makes up
<a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/environment/2020/07/06/wind-farm-to-tower-over-northwest-ohio-countryside/42083191/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>less

<p>
Vance is
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/jd-vance-vp-esg" target="_self"><u>an
oil and gas guy</u></a>, so maybe his ignorance of wind power can be
politely overlooked this one time. But going forward, when campaigning
and potentially working at a national level, it’ll be important for him
to get his facts straight. Wind is the largest source of renewable
electricity in the United States. It’s charging <em><em>a lot</em></em>
of cell phones.

Latin American grouping aims to confront economic problems</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The problems of rising poverty and decreasing
productivity in Latin America will be on the agenda when the foreign
ministers of 12 regional countries convene in Washington on Wednesday, a
U.S. State Department official said. </p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken aims during the talks to “tackle”
those challenges and work toward making the Americas “the world’s most
economically competitive region,” said Brian Nichols, assistant
secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs. </p>
<p>The ministers represent members of the Americas Partnership for
Economic Prosperity, established two years ago to “achieve concrete
results for the middle class, workers, and historically marginalized
groups” by deepening economic integration and creating good paying jobs,
Nichols said, speaking at a briefing this week. </p>
<p>“Through this partnership, we will work together to build resilient
supply chains, reinvigorate our region’s economic institutions, and
invest in our workers, our infrastructure, and our strategic industries
– whether through semiconductors or clean energy, or medical supplies or
the critical minerals needed for our modern economy.” </p>
<p>Nichols pointed out that the United States is Latin America’s largest
trading partner and its largest source of foreign direct investment. In
2023, U.S. trade with Latin America and the Caribbean totaled over $1.1
trillion, and Mexico displaced China as America’s top trading
partner.  </p>
<p>Nevertheless, he said “poverty rates are rising in Latin America,
productivity has lagged, and income inequality remains a serious
problem. The pandemic demonstrated to us and to our regional partners
the importance of developing more diversified and reliable supply chains
closer to home.” </p>
<p>Lisa Kubiske, a former U.S. ambassador to Honduras and former deputy
assistant secretary of state, said that in the past two years, the
member nations have been able to close gaps in their free trade
agreements and address structural issues that thwart broad-based
economic growth. </p>
<p>At a summit in November, she said, the leaders of the 12 countries
directed their ministers to develop three tracks: trade, finance and
foreign affairs. On the foreign affairs front, the group has engaged “on
clean hydrogen, entrepreneurship, rule of law and transparency, smart
agriculture, peaceful uses of space” and other issues, she told
journalists at a briefing.  </p>
<p>The president of the Inter-American Development Bank and the deputy
CEO of the Development Finance Corporation have been invited to a lunch
with the ministers. There will also be two side events, one hosted by
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and another hosted by the Council of the
Americas. </p>
<p>The founding members of the group are Barbados, Canada, Chile, Costa
Rica, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Peru,
the United States, and Uruguay. Their leaders will meet again next year
in Costa Rica.</p>

returns to campaign trail with speech to Black voters</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — All eyes will be on Joe Biden as he addresses Black
supporters Tuesday in the battleground state of Nevada, his first
campaign appearance since the assassination attempt on his Republican
rival, former president Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The U.S. president is expected to sharpen the choice voters will face
this November, while calling for unity amid concerns of escalating
political violence in the country.</p>
<p>In Las Vegas, at a convention of an American civil rights
organization, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People, or NAACP, Biden will highlight his administration’s support for
Black voters who have been part of the backbone of the Democratic
party’s coalition.</p>
<p>He is set to unveil policies to rein in rising housing costs, a
critical issue in Nevada. He’ll broadcast his message in an interview
with Black Entertainment Television, BET, later the same day.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, he’ll address UnidosUS, the nation’s largest Hispanic
civil rights and advocacy organization, attempting to win Latino voters,
another key voting bloc for Democrats.</p>
<p>In both events, Biden is expected to repeat his calls to cool down
the country’s political rhetoric, a message he has delivered in three
remarks in less than 24 hours following the shooting at Trump’s
Pennsylvania campaign event that killed a rallygoer and wounded others,
including the former president.</p>
<p>“Disagreement is inevitable in American democracy,” the president
said in a rare Oval Office address Sunday. “But politics must never be a
literal battlefield, and, God forbid, a killing field.”</p>
<p>Biden faces the challenge of navigating his unity message with his
vows to stop Trump at all costs, as his campaign adjusts its strategy to
move forward amid the president’s declining poll numbers. The Biden team
had just begun to more sharply criticize Trump in an effort to stabilize
Biden’s candidacy, following his rocky debate performance last month
when the shooting occurred.</p>
<p>Via his social media platform, Trump urged the nation to “stand
united.” He said in an interview with the Washington Examiner newspaper
that he rewrote his speech for this week’s Republican National
Convention to focus more on unity following the attempt on his life.</p>
<p>“I fear that this moment of detente won’t last very long,” said
Claire Finkelstein, director of the Center for Ethics and the Rule of
Law at the University of Pennsylvania. But it may bring greater
awareness from each candidate to refrain from rhetoric that “can have an
impact” especially on followers “who can be easily revved up into
engaging in acts of violence,” she told VOA.</p>
<p>Biden continues to reject calls from at least 20 congressional
Democrats and others within his party to step aside over concerns about
his age and mental acuity, insisting that he is the best-positioned
Democrat to beat Trump.</p>
<p>The latest polling data averages from various surveys compiled by
FiveThirtyEight shows that Trump is leading by 4.7 percent in
Nevada.</p>

<p>date: 2024-07-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The weekend assassination attempt on Donald Trump has silenced much
of the chatter over President Joe Biden’s political future. But as Trump
charged forward Monday, appearing at the Republican National Convention
and naming his vice presidential pick, the Biden administration prepared
for a Tuesday campaign stop in this uncertain stage in the presidential
race. VOA’s Anita Powell reports from the White House.</p>

National political conventions don’t make for the best TV. Prime-time
speeches are delivered by a parade of party celebrities and last for
only a few minutes — typically just enough time to bash gas prices
(<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/15/fact-check-republican-national-convention-day-1/#:~:text=This%20statement%20lacks%20context." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>nonsensically</u></a>)
and get in a few digs at the opposition. The highlight of the Republican
National Convention’s broadcast out of Milwaukee on Monday night was, in
fact, entirely wordless: former President Donald Trump’s walk across the
floor with a conspicuous white bandage over his ear.
</p>
<p>
The only words that really mattered on Monday were
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/15/republican-party-platform-trum-abortion/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reviewed
and approved behind closed doors</u></a>. “It’s a different kind of
platform,” Tennessee Senator and Chair of the Committee on the Platform
Marsha Blackburn said by way of introduction during her speech yesterday
evening. Reviewing how the 2024 Republican Party Platform’s energy
sections compare to the ones in 2016 (the GOP
<a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/8/24/21399396/republican-convention-platform-2020-2016" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>did
not write a new platform</u></a> for its convention in 2020), it’s clear
how true that actually is.
</p>
<p>
Eight years ago,
<a href="https://prod-cdn-static.gop.com/media/documents/DRAFT_12_FINAL%5B1%5D-ben_1468872234.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
Republican platform</u></a> included “Agriculture, Energy, and the
Environment” among its six chapters, describing goals such as “expedited
siting processes” for transmission lines; better forest management to
prevent wildfires; the “development of all forms of energy that are
marketable in a free economy without subsidies, including coal, oil,
natural gas, nuclear power, and hydropower” and renewable sources like
wind and solar by “private capital”; as well as the rejection of “the
agendas of both the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement.” The goals
were reasonably detailed, at least enough so that the 2016 platform ran
a full 50 pages longer than the 2024 version. (Trump, of course, has
little

for the written word</u></a>.)
</p>
<p>
The
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/64ab29f5-f8b7-4478-97e7-7afa84727e60.pdf?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template#toolbar=0&navpanes=0#scrollbar=0&itid=lk_inline_manual_20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2024
Republican platform</u></a> gets to its point much more quickly
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/15/republican-party-platform-trum-abortion/#:~:text=limit%20opponents%E2%80%99%20ability%20to%20use%20the%20language%20against%20them" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>by
design</u></a>. “MAKE AMERICA THE DOMINANT ENERGY PRODUCER IN THE WORLD,
BY FAR!” is fourth on the priority list. That’s an easy enough goal
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-oil-gas-fact-check#:~:text=the%20United%20States%20is%20the%20top%20oil%2Dproducing%20country" target="_self"><u>since
the U.S. is </u><u><em><em>already</em></em></u></a> the world’s
dominant energy producer, at least in oil and natural gas, the favored
fuels of both
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-47-committee-big-oil" target="_self"><u>Trump</u></a>
and
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/j-d-vances-energy-record-oil-cash-and-ev-attacks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Vance</u></a>.
The platform further promises to “DRILL, BABY, DRILL” its way to the
U.S. becoming “Energy Independent and even Dominant again” — another
easy goal since the country is
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-oil-gas-fact-check#:~:text=%E2%80%9COn%20January%206%2C%20we%20were%20energy%20independent.%E2%80%9D%20%5BJune%2027%2C%202024%5D" target="_self"><u>already
energy independent</u></a> by multiple definitions. Coal, until recently
a staple Republican talking point, gets
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/coal-2024-election-trump-biden" target="_self"><u>just
one</u></a> blink-and-you’ll-miss-it reference.
</p>
<p>
The platform offers no specific plan for improving on President Biden’s
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/19/business/us-production-oil-reserves-crude/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>record
oil and gas production numbers</u></a>. It <em><em>does</em></em>,
however, state that the party will ensure “Reliable and Abundant Low
Cost Energy,” a statement that, by omission, implies the party will do
so without the same level of all-caps enthusiasm for
<em><em>electrification</em></em>. This will be quite a feat as the
renewable cost curve continues to
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/charts-renewables-are-on-track-to-keep-getting-cheaper-and-cheaper#:~:text=Renewable%20energy%20already%20beats%20fossil,clean%20energy%20think%20tank%20RMI." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>trend
down</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Also new to the platform in 2024 is hostility toward electric vehicles,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-electric-vehicles-fact-check" target="_self"><u>a
favorite talking point of Trump’s</u></a> on the campaign trail and a
longtime punching bag of Vance’s. The party claims that it can “Save the
American Auto Industry” by “reversing harmful Regulations, canceling
Biden’s Electric Vehicle and other Mandates, and preventing the
importation of Chinese vehicles.” Given that there
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/28/us/politics/trump-fact-check-electric-vehicles.html#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20federal%20electric%20vehicle%20mandate" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>isn’t
actually an EV mandate</u></a>, that sounds pretty much “exactly like
what Democrats want,” the economic columnist Noah Smith wrote in his
recent
<a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/lets-evaluate-the-whole-republican?r=b7n&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>breakdown
of the platform</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Finally, alongside other pressingly important issues to the American
public like making Washington, D.C., “the most beautiful capital city,”
the 2024 Republican platform gestures toward restoring “genuine
Conservation efforts.” Such a promise, buried at the end of the
document, rings especially hollow given that Trump oversaw
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/31/health/protected-land-conservation-study/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
largest reduction of protected land</u></a> in U.S. history.
</p>
<p>
Of course, shabby promises are to be expected. Party platforms are
non-binding and, as Smith also points out, they reveal far more about
who Republicans are appealing to,
<a href="https://msmagazine.com/2024/07/12/republican-trump-position-abortion/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>and
how</u></a>, than what they
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self"><u>actually
plan to do once they’re in power</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
The pared-down energy and climate sections in the 2024 platform don’t
necessarily mean Trump will keep
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-climate-legacy" target="_self"><u>Biden-era
policies</u></a> largely intact, then. If anything, they simply leave
more room for Trump to do whatever he wants if — or
<a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-biden" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>when?</u></a>
— he wins back the White House.

“the region’s outsized vastness and ecological value” should be
protected. More than 40 Indigenous communities rely on the resources and
wildlife in the reserve. Earlier this year the Biden administration
restricted new oil and gas leasing on 13 million acres of the reserve,
and will soon invite the public to weigh in on whether more land should
be protected. The Trump administration opened most of the reserve to
fossil fuel exploration efforts in 2020, but Biden reversed that move in
2022.

<p>After months of speculation, Donald Trump announced his vice
presidential running mate. J.D. Vance joins the Republican presidential
ticket as one of the youngest vice presidential candidates since Richard
Nixon in 1952. The nomination puts his newcomer status and political
inexperience to the test. Tina Trinh reports.</p>

Dream of 24/7 Clean Electricity Gets a Funding Boost</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-16, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjY4NDMwMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0ODY3NTM0M30.am5RQVjGVPAJHXxY3RJx1l6zoOJmDplm83_I9hs10OI/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
The United Nations calls
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/24-7-clean-energy-hydrogen" target="_self"><u>24/7
carbon-free energy generation</u></a>, also known as hourly matching,
“<a href="https://www.un.org/en/energy-compacts/page/compact-247-carbon-free-energy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>t</u><u>he
end state</u></a> of a fully decarbonized electricity system.” It means
that every kilowatt-hour of electricity consumed is matched with a
zero-emissions electricity source, every hour of every day. It’s
something that Google and Microsoft are aiming to implement by 2030, and
it represents a much more significant climate commitment than today’s
default system of annualized matching
</p>
<p>
So here’s a positive sign: LevelTen Energy, the leading marketplace for
power purchase agreements, just raised $65 million in Series D funding,
led by the investment firm B Capital with participation from Microsoft,
Google, and Prelude Ventures, among others.
</p>
<p>
The money will help support LevelTen’s work with the
<a href="https://www.leveltenenergy.com/alliance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Granular
Certificate Trading Alliance</u></a>, a collaboration it started last
December in partnership with the Intercontinental Exchange, a data firm
that operates global financial marketplaces. Together they’re building a
platform for trading and managing “granular certificates,”
hourly-matched energy certificates that will help corporations — and
ideally the electricity sector at large — move to 24/7 hourly matching.
Other partners to the alliance include Google, Microsoft, and the energy
companies AES and Constellation.
</p>
<p>
To date, LevelTen has facilitated over $15.8 billion in power purchase
agreements, asset sales, and other clean energy transactions, totaling
over 7 gigawatts of clean energy. Overall, the company has raised more
than $125 million, with past investors including the My Climate Journey
Collective as well as the investment arms of oil and gas companies such
as
<a href="https://www.leveltenenergy.com/post/series-c-funding" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Equinor
and TotalEnergies</u></a>, which are adding renewables to their
portfolios.
</p>
<p>
Bryce Smith, LevelTen’s founder and CEO, told me the platform will
launch its first auctions for hourly-matched clean energy by the end of
the year, with initial customers expected to be corporate partners like
Google and Microsoft themselves.
</p>
<p>
“Corporates have been leading the way in a lot of respects and they’re
doing it again on the granular certificate front,” Smith said. He sees
it as LevelTen’s job to get more industry players onboard by creating
the transaction infrastructure to enable hourly matching. “So there’s a
bit of a ‘build it and they will come’ aspect to this,” he told me.
</p>
<p>
Realistically, though, it’s unlikely that the electricity industry will
move towards 24/7 clean energy absent some serious incentives to do so.
That’s why the Biden administration’s proposed
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/hydrogen-rule-biden-clean-energy" target="_self"><u>hydrogen
tax credit rules</u></a> could be so powerful. They stipulate that to
qualify for the largest IRA subsidies, clean hydrogen must be produced
using a relatively new source of carbon-free electricity, generated
within the <em><em>same hour</em></em> that it’s used and in roughly the
same location. If these regulations aren’t deleted or seriously altered
by this or another new administration
(<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/hydrogen-tax-credit-rules" target="_self"><u>which
they probably will be</u></a>), power grids would have until 2028 to set
up new systems for hourly accounting, thereby laying the groundwork for
24/7 matching across the electricity sector at large.
</p>
<p>
That potential, tenuous and unlikely though it may be, has LevelTen
excited, and the company is leaning hard into hydrogen. LevelTen is a
founding member of
<a href="https://h2di.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
Hydrogen Demand Initiative</u></a>, a coalition formed by the Department
of Energy to ensure that the clean hydrogen produced by the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/hydrogen-hubs-biden-pennsylvania-california-texas" target="_self"><u>seven
designated hydrogen hubs</u></a> is actually sold. The DOE is allocating
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-jumpstart-clean-hydrogen-economy-new-initiative-provide-market" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$1
billion to help catalyze demand</u></a>, and it’s up to H2DI to figure
out how to distribute that. “A component of that is figuring out how to
bring buyers and sellers together easily and smoothly,” Smith told me.
“And that’s the role that we play in creating a marketplace where buyers
and sellers can find each other and execute.”
</p>
<p>
Smith is aware that a change in administration could very well mean
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/hydrogen-rule-biden-clean-energy" target="_self"><u>a
change in the hydrogen tax credit rules</u></a>, potentially decreasing
incentives for green hydrogen and making hydrogen produced from natural
gas with carbon capture and storage (“blue hydrogen”) or hydrogen
produced without CCS (“gray hydrogen”) more attractive. He said the
LevelTen platform would likely support transactions that involve a
“variety of hydrogen colors and technologies.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s most important for us always is figuring out how to put a vital
technology on the fastest track to scaling,” Smith told me. “And if that
means accommodating different colors for some period of time, we have
the end goal [of green hydrogen] always in mind.”
</p>
<p>
As LevelTen scales, it’s also working to get more utilities onto its
platform. Smith told me that utility customers have, “really only fairly
recently realized that their procurement needs around renewables are
massive.”<em> </em>As the push to “electrify everything” gains momentum
and data centers suck up more and more power, utilities are increasingly
investing in renewable energy to meet their electricity needs, diversify
their portfolios and respond to customer demand for clean power. “We’re
used to seeing really slow, fairly predictable demand and electricity
growth from a utility perspective, and that’s changing pretty
dramatically,” Smith told me.
</p>
<p>
LevelTen currently operates in 29 countries across North America and
Europe, and hopes to use its recent funding to expand into new regions.

id="donald-trump-enters-republican-convention-hall-with-a-bandaged-ear-and-gets-a-heros-welcome">Donald
Trump enters Republican convention hall with a bandaged ear and gets a
hero’s welcome</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Milwaukee — Two days after surviving an attempted assassination,
former President Donald Trump appeared triumphantly at the Republican
National Convention’s opening night with a bandage over his right ear,
the latest compelling scene in a presidential campaign already defined
by dramatic turns.</p>
<p>Delegates cheered wildly when Trump appeared onscreen backstage and
then emerged in the arena, visibly emotional, as musician Lee Greenwood
sang “God Bless the USA.” That was hours after the convention had
formally nominated the former president to head the Republican ticket in
November against President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Trump, accompanied by a wall of Secret Service agents, did not
address the hall — with his acceptance speech scheduled for Thursday —
but smiled silently and occasionally waved as Greenwood sang. He
eventually joined his newly announced running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D.
Vance, to listen to the night’s remaining speeches, often with a subdued
expression and muted reactions uncharacteristic for the unabashed
showman.</p>
<p>The raucous welcome underscored the depth of the crowd’s affection
for the man who won the 2016 nomination as an outsider, at odds with the
party establishment, but has vanquished all Republican rivals, silenced
most conservative critics and now commands loyalty up and down the party
ranks.</p>
<p>“We must unite as a party, and we must unite as a nation,” said
Republican Party Chairman Michael Whatley, Trump’s handpicked party
leader, as he opened Monday’s prime-time national convention session.
“We must show the same strength and resilience as President Trump and
lead this nation to a greater future.”</p>
<p>But Whatley and other Republican leaders made clear that their calls
for harmony did not extend to Biden and Democrats, who find themselves
still riven by worries that the 81-year-old question is not up to the
job of defeating Trump.</p>
<p>“Their policies are a clear and present danger to America, to our
institutions, our values and our people,” said Wisconsin Sen. Ron
Johnson, welcoming the party to his battleground state, which Trump won
in 2016 but lost to Biden four years ago.</p>
<p>Saturday’s shooting at a Pennsylvania rally, where Trump was injured
and one man died, were clearly in mind, but the proceedings were
celebratory — a stark contrast to the anger and anxiety that had marked
the previous few days. Some delegates chanted “fight, fight, fight” —
the same words that Trump was seen shouting to the crowd Saturday as the
Secret Service ushered him off the stage, his fist raised and face
bloodied.</p>
<p>“We should all be thankful right now that we are able to cast our
votes for President Donald J. Trump after what took place on Saturday,”
said New Jersey state Sen. Michael Testa as he announced all of his
state’s 12 delegates for Trump.</p>
<p>When Trump cleared the necessary number of delegates, video screens
in the arena read “OVER THE TOP” while the song “Celebration” played and
delegates danced and waved Trump signs. Throughout the voting, delegates
flanked by “Make America Great Again” signs applauded as state after
state voted their support for a second Trump term.</p>
<p>Multiple speakers invoked religious imagery to discuss Trump and the
assassination attempt.</p>
<p>“The devil came to Pennsylvania holding a rifle,” said Sen. Tim Scott
of South Carolina. “But an American lion got back up on his feet!”</p>
<p>Wyoming delegate Sheryl Foland was among those who adopted the
“fight” chant after seeing Trump survive Saturday in what she called
“monumental photos and video.”</p>
<p>“We knew then we were going to adopt that as our chant,” added
Foland, a child trauma mental health counselor. “Not just because we
wanted him to fight, and that God was fighting for him. We thought,
isn’t it our job to accept that challenge and fight for our
country?”</p>
<p>“It’s bigger than Trump,” Foland said. “It’s a mantra for our
country.”</p>
<p>Another well-timed development boosted the mood on the convention
floor Monday: The federal judge presiding over Trump’s classified
documents case dismissed the prosecution because of concerns over the
appointment of the prosecutor who brought the case, handing the former
president a major court victory.</p>
<p>The convention is designed to reach people outside the GOP base</p>
<p>Trump’s campaign chiefs designed the convention to feature a softer
and more optimistic message, focusing on themes that would help a
divisive leader expand his appeal among moderate voters and people of
color.</p>
<p>On a night devoted to the economy, delegates and a national TV
audience heard from speakers the Trump campaign pitched as “everyday
Americans” — a single mother talking about inflation, a union member who
identified himself as a lifelong Democrat now backing Trump, a
small-business owner, among others.</p>
<p>Featured speakers also included Black Republicans who have been at
the forefront of the Trump campaign’s effort to win more votes from a
core Democratic constituency.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt of Texas said rising grocery and energy prices
were hurting Americans’ wallets and quoted Ronald Reagan in calling
inflation “the cruelest tax on the poor.” Hunt argued Biden and Vice
President Kamala Harris didn’t seem to understand the problem.</p>
<p>“We can fix this disaster,” Hunt said, by electing Trump and sending
“him right back to where he belongs, the White House.”</p>
<p>Scott, perhaps the party’s most well-known Black lawmaker, declared,
“America is not a racist country.”</p>
<p>Republicans hailed Vance’s selection as a key step toward a winning
coalition in November.</p>
<p>Trump announced his choice of his running mate as delegates were
voting on the former president’s nomination Monday. The young Ohio
senator first rose to national attention with his bestselling memoir,
“Hillbilly Elegy,” which told of his Appalachian upbringing and was
hailed as a window into the parts of working-class America that helped
propel Trump.</p>
<p>North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who had been considered a potential
vice presidential pick, said in a post on X that Vance’s “small town
roots and service to country make him a powerful voice for the America
First Agenda.”</p>
<p>Yet despite calls for harmony, two of the opening speakers at
Monday’s evening session — Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and
North Carolina gubernatorial nominee Mark Robinson — are known as some
of the party’s most incendiary figures.</p>
<p>Robinson, speaking recently during a church service in North
Carolina, discussed “evil” people who he said threatened American
Christianity. “Some folks need killing,” he said then, though he steered
clear of such rhetoric on the convention stage.</p>
<p>Opening night also did not pass without references to the 2020
election and Trump’s repeated lies that it was stolen from him.</p>
<p>Trump’s nomination came on the same day that Biden sat for another
national TV interview as the president sought to demonstrate his
capacity to serve another four years despite continued worries within
his own party.</p>
<p>Biden told ABC News that he made a mistake recently when he told
Democratic donors the party must stop questioning his fitness for office
and instead put Trump in a “bull’s-eye.” Republicans have circulated the
comment aggressively since Saturday’s assassination attempt, with some
openly blaming Biden for inciting the attack on Trump’s life.</p>
<p>The president’s admission was in line with his call Sunday from the
Oval Office for all Americans to ratchet down political rhetoric. But
Biden maintained Monday that drawing contrasts with Trump, who employs
harsh and accusatory language, is a legitimate part of a presidential
contest.</p>
<p>Inside the arena in Milwaukee, Republicans did not dial back their
attacks on Biden, at one point playing a video that mocked the
president’s physical stamina and mental acuity.</p>
<p>They alluded often to the “Biden-Harris administration” and took
regular digs at Vice President Kamala Harris — a not-so-subtle allusion
to the notion that Biden could step aside in favor of his
second-in-command.</p>

Trump on Monday made high-profile appearances, each man acknowledging in
his own way how the weekend assassination attempt against Trump has
reshaped both of their presidential campaigns.</p>
<p>Trump briefly appeared on stage at the Republican National Convention
late Monday, a white bandage taped over his right ear where a bullet
clipped him Saturday as he addressed a Pennsylvania rally. On Monday,
the Biden administration announced a separate, independent investigation
into the shooting, as the Federal Bureau of Investigation leads the main
inquiry.</p>
<p>The stark differences between the two main presidential campaigns
were further illuminated Monday, with Trump not uttering a word but
entering the Milwaukee stadium to rapturous applause and a standing,
cheering ovation sustained for the length of a very, very extended
version of Trump’s signature campaign song, “God Bless the U.S.A.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Biden spoke in cool, measured tones to NBC’s Lester Holt,
saying that he still deeply disagrees with Trump, and with the
“inflammatory” and “vicious” way Trump and his base communicate their
grievances.</p>
<p>And asked whether he thought the shooting would change the trajectory
of the presidential race:</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” he replied. “You don’t either.”</p>
<p>But the weekend’s events seem to have resolved the last political
cliffhanger – the national debate over whether Biden’s poor, stumbling
June debate performance against Trump meant he should step aside.</p>
<p>“I expect that Joe Biden has weathered the storm and this question
about whether he should drop out is mostly in the rearview mirror,” said
Jim Kessler, executive vice president for think tank Third Way. “But he
needs to perform well.”</p>
<p>Biden, in the lengthy interview held at the White House after he
canceled a planned Monday trip to Austin, aimed to distinguish himself
from his rival in stark terms.</p>
<p>“Look, I’m not the guy that said I want to be a dictator on day one,”
he said. “I’m not the guy that refused to accept the outcome of the
election. I’m not the guy who said that he wouldn’t accept the outcome
of this election.”</p>
<p>Both men have called for unity in the wake of Trump’s shooting.</p>
<p>But analysts say that word may not mean what you think it means.</p>
<p>“They’re both calling for unity,” said John Geer, a distinguished
professor of political science at Vanderbilt University. “But I think
their differences in the kind of concept are fundamental. And that’s
where the, I think the problem is going to break down. And so they’re
calling for it, but, in fact, it may well be partisanship in
disguise.”</p>
<p>And the political divide between Americans is so bitter that advocacy
groups are warning that it’s not just the candidates who need to cool it
– voters need to do so as well.</p>
<p>“Stay passionate about the causes you care about and remain engaged,”
said Will Fuller, of Pennsylvania-based Common Ground USA, in guidance
sent to journalists Monday. “We face significant challenges that require
us to fulfill the promise of opportunity for all Americans. But in that
work, it’s essential to distinguish between advocating for our beliefs
and fighting against each other.”</p>

officials sue to block ‘baby bonus’ initiative that would give new
parents $1,000</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BALTIMORE — Baltimore’s mayor and city council have filed a lawsuit
seeking to stop a proposal that would let voters decide whether to give
all new parents a one-time $1,000 “baby bonus” meant to help alleviate
childhood poverty from birth.</p>
<p>The complaint was filed Thursday, according to online court records.
It came not long after organizers secured the necessary 10,000
signatures to bring the question to voters as a ballot initiative in
November.</p>
<p>City leaders argue that the proposal is unconstitutional and should
be blocked from the ballot because it would give voters too much say
over legislative decisions, effectively “usurping those powers” from
their elected officials.</p>
<p>An estimated 7,000 children are born in Baltimore each year, so the
program would cost about $7 million annually. That amounts to roughly
0.16% of the city’s annual operating budget, according to supporters. It
wouldn’t result in higher taxes, but it would be up to the city council
to allocate the necessary funds.</p>
<p>The lawsuit claims that the charter amendment process is meant to
address changes to the form and structure of government, not specific
legislative or budgetary questions.</p>
<p>But supporters of the baby bonus say the lawsuit is a political power
grab.</p>
<p>“We are fully confident the courts will reject this attack on
democracy,” the Maryland Child Alliance said in a statement posted to
social media last week. The group was founded by Baltimore teachers
advocating for legislation to alleviate child poverty.</p>
<p>They say more systemic change is needed on a national level to help
lift families out of poverty, but giving new parents a modest financial
boost could prove an important first step.</p>
<p>The proposal is loosely modeled on a program implemented this year in
Flint, Michigan, where women receive $1,500 during mid-pregnancy and
$500 per month for the first year after giving birth. Officials said the
Flint program was the first of its kind in the U.S. Countries in Europe
and Asia have experimented with larger cash payments, but those programs
are meant to encourage people to have more kids, not address child
poverty.</p>
<p>Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott’s administration, which launched a
guaranteed income pilot program targeting young single parents in 2022,
said in a statement that he’s “supportive of the proposed amendment’s
objectives” even though he wants it off the ballot.</p>

arrests plunge 29% in June to the lowest of Biden’s presidency</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN DIEGO — Arrests for illegally crossing the border from Mexico
plunged 29% in June, the lowest month of Joe Biden’s presidency,
according to figures released Monday that provide another window on the
impact of a new rule to temporarily suspend asylum.</p>
<p>Arrests totaled 83,536 in June, down from 117,901 in May to mark the
lowest tally since January 2021, U.S. Customs and Border Protection
said.</p>
<p>A seven-day average of daily arrests fell more than half by the end
of June from Biden’s announcement on June 4 that asylum processing would
be halted when daily arrests reach 2,500, which they did immediately,
said Troy Miller, acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner.</p>
<p>“Recent border security measures have made a meaningful impact on our
ability to impose consequences for those crossing unlawfully,” Miller
said.</p>
<p>Arrests had already fallen by more than half from a record high of
250,000 in December, largely a result of increased enforcement by
Mexican authorities, according to U.S. officials.</p>
<p>Sharp declines registered across nationalities, including Mexicans,
who have been most affected by the suspension of asylum, and Chinese
people, who generally fly to Ecuador and travel to the U.S. border over
land.</p>
<p>San Diego was the busiest of the Border Patrol’s nine sectors
bordering Mexico by number of arrests, followed by Tucson, Arizona.</p>
<p>More than 41,000 people entered legally through an online appointment
app called CBP One in June. The agency said 680,500 people have
successfully scheduled appointments since the app was introduced in
January 2023.</p>
<p>Nearly 500,000 people from four countries entered on a policy to
allow two-year stays on condition they have financial sponsors and
arrive at an airport. They include 104,130 Cubans, 194,027 Haitians,
86,101 Nicaraguans and 110,541 Venezuelans, according to CBP.</p>

<h2 id="biden-says-bulls-eye-reference-to-trump-was-a-mistake">Biden
says ‘bull’s-eye’ reference to Trump was a mistake</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden said on Monday he made a
mistake when he told supporters to put rival Donald Trump in a
“bull’s-eye” in an effort to focus attention on his rival’s behavior but
said Trump regularly employed rhetoric that was inflammatory.</p>
<p>“It was a mistake to use the word,” Biden said in an interview with
NBC’s Lester Holt. “I meant focus on it, focus on what he’s doing,”
Biden said.</p>
<p>On July 8, Biden, 81, spoke to some of his biggest donors and said
they needed to shift the election campaign’s focus from him and his poor
debate performance to former President Trump, the Republican nominee in
the Nov. 5 election.</p>
<p>“I have one job and that’s to beat Donald Trump … We’re done talking
about the debate. It’s time to put Trump in the bull’s-eye,” he
said.</p>
<p>Some Republicans zeroed in on that comment as they blamed Biden for
creating a climate that sparked the assassination attempt on Trump at a
rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday. Biden has repeatedly decried
political violence.</p>
<p>The president has endured more than two weeks of questions about his
political future, so far facing down calls to step aside as the
Democratic presidential candidate after his poor performance against
Trump in the debate on June 27 sparked a crisis within his party.</p>
<p>He reiterated in the interview that he is not leaving the race, while
acknowledging that people’s questions about his age were legitimate.</p>
<p>Biden also weighed in on Trump’s selection of Senator J.D. Vance of
Ohio as his running mate.</p>
<p>Asked by NBC’s Lester Holt what Vance’s selection said about Trump’s
values, Biden replied: “He’s going to surround himself with people who
agree completely with him.” Biden, chuckling, also noted some of Vance’s
previously critical comments about Trump.</p>
<p>The president has sought to turn attention to his opponent,
highlighting Trump’s falsehoods, his refusal to accept the 2020 election
results and his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.</p>
<p>“I’m not the guy that said I want to be a dictator on day one. I’m
not the guy that refused to accept the outcome of the election,” Biden
said.</p>
<p>He said Trump had engaged in inflammatory rhetoric, citing the former
president’s comments about a bloodbath ensuing if he loses the 2024
election and making fun when former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s
husband Paul was attacked by an intruder with a hammer at their
home.</p>
<p>“How do you talk about the threat to democracy, which is real, when a
president says things like he says? Do you just not say anything because
it may incite somebody?” Biden said. “I have not engaged in that
rhetoric. Now … my opponent’s engaged in that rhetoric.”</p>
<p>Biden, who is seeking to prove that he is fit to stand for reelection
and govern for a second four-year term despite concerns about his age,
noted that millions of people had voted for him to be the Democratic
Party’s nominee. “I listen to them,” he said.</p>

<h2 id="trump-taps-ohios-junior-senator-as-his-running-mate">Trump taps
Ohio’s junior senator as his running mate</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Milwaukee — Former U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday selected
J.D. Vance, a senator from the Midwestern state of Ohio, as his running
mate in November’s presidential election.</p>
<p>Trump made the announcement on his Truth Social media platform,
saying he decided the Marine Corps veteran and Yale Law School graduate
is “the person best suited” to become vice president of the United
States.</p>
<p>Shortly after Trump’s naming of the 39-year-old Vance, the bearded
senator took a victory lap on the floor of the Republican National
Convention in Milwaukee as thousands of delegates cheered.</p>
<p>Trump drew his own cheers late Monday as he made an appearance at the
convention sporting a bandage on his right ear from an assassination
attempt at his Saturday campaign rally.</p>
<p>Vance is expected to address the gathering on Wednesday, the night
before Trump formally accepts the party’s presidential nomination for
the third consecutive time.</p>
<p>“I think it was an excellent choice,” an excited Ginger Howard, a
party national committeewoman from Georgia, told VOA on the floor of the
convention. “I think they’re going to make a great team.”</p>
<p>Just before boarding Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland,
President Joe Biden, responding to a reporter’s question about Vance’s
selection, termed the senator “a clone of Trump on the issues. I don’t
see any difference.”</p>
<p>Biden’s reelection campaign was quick to elaborate, characterizing
Vance as a willing servant to Trump’s more autocratic and regressive
undertakings.</p>
<p>Trump, twice impeached and now a convicted felon for falsifying
business records, picked Vance because he “will do what Mike Pence
wouldn’t on January 6: bend over backwards to enable Trump and his
extreme MAGA agenda, even if it means breaking the law and no matter the
harm to the American people,” said Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, who chairs
the Biden-Harris campaign.</p>
<p>Trump has downplayed the severity of the January 6, 2021, riot at the
U.S. Capitol, framing it as a legitimate protest against what he claimed
without evidence was a “stolen” 2020 presidential election. He has also
criticized the subsequent federal investigation and prosecution of those
involved, labeling it a witch hunt politically motivated by Biden, his
opponent in a second consecutive election.</p>
<p>Biden’s running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris, is “fully
prepared” to debate Vance under the format proposed by CBS News,
according to the Democrats’ campaign.</p>
<p>“Trump’s VP pick is great news for wealthy Americans and terrible for
everybody else,” Senator Elizabeth Warren told reporters on a
Biden-Harris campaign conference call shortly after the former
president’s announcement of his running mate.</p>
<p>“Social Security and Medicare cuts will bear down on seniors like an
avalanche” if Trump and Vance are elected, predicted Warren. “Millions
will face losing access to health insurance.”</p>
<p>Vance has emerged as a strong advocate of Trump and his hard-line
policies, from immigration restrictions to cuts for social programs. But
as was true of numerous other prominent Republicans when the New York
real estate developer first ran for president eight years ago, Vance had
been highly critical of Trump.</p>
<p>“Trump makes people I care about afraid. Immigrants, Muslims, etc.
Because of this I find him reprehensible. God wants better of us,” Vance
said on Twitter in October 2016. He subsequently deleted the tweet.</p>
<p>Vance, a venture capitalist before being elected a senator, first
rose to prominence with his memoir Hillbilly Elegy, which was made into
a Hollywood movie. The book and film chronicle his experiences coming of
age in a struggling working-class family in the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>With his name aside Trump’s on the 2024 ticket, Vance immediately
becomes the most prominent Republican to be passed the torch of a
political party radically reframed by Trumpism.</p>
<p>Trump, if he is elected again and serves a full second term, would be
82 the day he leaves office.</p>
<p>Biden’s cognitive abilities at his current age of 81 have emerged as
a major campaign issue and divided his own Democratic Party, with a
growing number of prominent Democrats in and out of Congress calling for
him to abandon his reelection bid in favor of a younger replacement.</p>
<p>“Trump wanted a younger candidate who can campaign and connect with
working-class voters, especially in the Midwest. Vance is also the first
millennial to appear as a major party nominee on a presidential ticket,
representing a generational change in U.S. politics,” said Cayce Myers,
a Virginia Tech professor of public relations.</p>
<p>Vance would become the second-youngest vice president in U.S. history
if elected along with Trump. Democrat John C. Breckinridge was 36 when
he took the oath of office as vice president on March 4, 1857, under
President James Buchanan. Republican Richard Nixon, as President Dwight
Eisenhower’s vice president, was 40 when he took on the role in 1953.
Breckinridge failed in his subsequent quest for the presidency. Nixon
was elected president in 1968 after a losing bid eight years
earlier.</p>
<p>A survey of 3,000 U.S. adults conducted Monday by polling firm YouGov
indicated a lack of strong opinions on Trump’s choice of Vance,
particularly among political independents.</p>
<p>Asked if they had a favorable opinion of Vance, 43% of all
respondents said they were not sure, compared to the equal split of 29%
who said they had either favorable or unfavorable views.</p>
<p>Among respondents who identified as independents, 53% said they were
not sure whether they viewed Vance favorably or unfavorably.</p>
<p>Self-identified Republicans had the highest views of Vance, with 33%
selecting very favorable, while 46% of self-identified Democrats chose
very unfavorable.</p>

<h2 id="hikers-die-in-utah-parks-as-temperatures-hit-extreme-highs">3
hikers die in Utah parks as temperatures hit extreme highs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SALT LAKE CITY — Three hikers died over the weekend in suspected
heat-related cases at state and national parks in Utah, including a
father and daughter who got lost on a strenuous hike in Canyonlands
National Park in extreme temperatures. </p>
<p>The daughter, 23, and her father, 52, sent a 911 text alerting
dispatchers that they were lost and had run out of water while hiking
the 13-kilometer (8.1-mile) Syncline Loop, described by the National
Park Service as the most challenging trail in the Island in the Sky
district of the southeast Utah park. The pair set out Friday to navigate
steep switchbacks and scramble through boulder fields with limited trail
markers as the air temperature surpassed 38 degrees Celsius (100 degrees
Fahrenheit). </p>
<p>Park rangers and a helicopter crew with the Bureau of Land Management
began their search for the lost hikers in the early evening Friday but
found them already dead. The San Juan County Sheriff’s Office identified
them Monday as Albino Herrera Espinoza and his daughter, Beatriz
Herrera, of Green Bay, Wisconsin. </p>
<p>Due to the jagged terrain, safety officials used a helicopter to
airlift the bodies out of the park and to the state medical examiner
Saturday morning, according to the sheriff’s office. Their deaths are
being investigated as heat-related by the local sheriff and the National
Park Service. </p>
<p>Later Saturday, first responders in southwest Utah responded to a
call about two hikers “suffering from a heat-related incident” at Snow
Canyon State Park, which is known for its lava tubes, sand dunes and a
canyon carved from red and white Navajo Sandstone. </p>
<p>A multi-agency search team found and treated two hikers who were
suffering from heat exhaustion. While they were treating those
individuals, a passing hiker informed them of an unconscious person
nearby. First responders found the 30-year-old woman dead, public safety
officials said. </p>
<p>Her death is being investigated by the Santa Clara-Ivins Public
Safety Department. She has not been identified publicly. </p>
<p>Tourists continue to flock to parks in Utah and other southwestern
states during the hottest months of the year, even as officials caution
that hiking in extreme heat poses serious health risks. Earlier this
month, a Texas man died while hiking at Grand Canyon National Park,
where summer temperatures on exposed parts of the trail can reach over
49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
On Monday afternoon, following a flurry of leaks
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/07/15/us/trump-rnc-news-biden/senator-marco-rubio-appears-to-be-out-of-the-running-as-trumps-vp-pick?smid=url-share" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ruling

Rubio as Donald Trump’s pick for vice president, the former president
<a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/112792061935980928" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced</u></a>
<em><em>Hillbilly Elegy</em></em> author and Ohio junior senator J. D.
Vance as his 2024 running mate.
</p>
<p>
A
<a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/11/trump-vp-pick-rnc-donald-jr" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>favorite
of Trump’s son Don, Jr.</u></a> who has molded himself into a populist
on the intellectual vanguard of conservatism, Vance has taken on
aggressive, culturally inflected views on climate change. While just
four years ago he was saying that the United States has a
“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/climate/jd-vance-climate-change.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate
problem</u></a>,” he has since tacked hard to the right and become a
champion of the fossil fuel industry, especially in his home state of
Ohio, where his 2022 Senate campaign received
<a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/09/05/jd-vance-is-one-of-the-top-recipients-of-oil-and-gas-money-now-hes-shilling-for-their-interests/" target="_blank"><u>generous
backing from the oil and gas industry</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
While skepticism of anthropogenic climate change and support for oil and
gas are nothing new for a Republican officeholder, where Vance has
carved himself a particular niche is as a prominent critic of the use of
environmental, governance, and social standards in investing, otherwise
known as ESG. This is the idea that major investors would reward
companies based on their adherence to a set of standards that often
include climate-related targets and policies.
</p>
<p>
The supposed evils of ESG make a natural theme for Vance, one that melds
traditional conservative support for business (and especially fossil
fuels) and criticism of socially liberal —
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-vp-picks" target="_self"><u>sorry,
woke</u></a> — elites into a more populist message than a typical
Chamber of Commerce criticism of regulation. Or, as Vance himself put it
to <em><em>Breitbart </em></em>in the days leading up to his election to
the Senate in 2022, “ESG is basically a racket to destroy what we still
have so that a few people on Wall Street can make some money.”
(Somewhere along the line, his company also
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-01/woke-inc-author-s-firm-targets-blackrock-esg-investing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>invested</u></a>
in
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/republicans-weave-a-climate-conspiracy-at-the-final-debate" target="_self"><u>erstwhile
Republican presidential candidate</u></a> Vivek Ramaswamy’s anti-woke
asset management firm, according to <em><em>Bloomberg</em></em>.)
</p>
<p>
By the time he took office in January 2023, <em><em>Politico</em></em>
was already calling Vance
“<a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2023/01/25/meet-j-d-vance-the-senates-new-anti-esg-warrior-00077784" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
Senate’s new anti-ESG warrior</u></a>.” That July,
<a href="https://www.vance.senate.gov/press-releases/senators-vance-lummis-marshall-to-introduce-legislation-to-establish-special-inspector-general-to-investigate-abuses-by-financial-sector-regulators/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he
sponsored a bill</u></a> alongside Wyoming’s Cynthia Lummis and Kansas’
Roger Marshall, Republican senators both, that would have appointed an
inspector general inside the Treasury Department to “oversee allegations
of regulatory abuse and misconduct by financial regulators and kneecap
the ability of regulators to push left-wing policy goals through the
federal regulatory system.”
</p>
<p>
Last year, Vance also wrote an op-ed for the <em><em>Marietta
Times</em></em> arguing for greater exploitation of the Utica Shale, a
geological formation that runs under Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania,
and New York that contains an estimated
<a href="https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/usgs-estimates-214-trillion-cubic-feet-natural-gas-appalachian-basin" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>3
billion barrels of oil and natural gas</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Vance claimed in the op-ed that “in an effort to discourage investment
in oil and gas companies, President Biden has weaponized the Securities
and Exchange Commission to mandate environmental, social, and governance
(ESG) scores on publicly traded companies.” (He also noted that “Utica
Shale oil production increased by 65 percent in 2023” compared to the
year prior, and that wells in Columbiana County in Southeast Ohio had
“set new oil production records at the start of the year.”)
</p>
<p>
Admittedly, Trump’s decision to pick Vance as a running mate doesn’t
seem likely to swing the general election needle too much in any one way
or another (though it might mess a little with the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-cabinet" target="_self"><u>cabinet
position calculus</u></a>). So far on Monday, the choice has been
generally well-received by Republicans,
<a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/07/15/rnc-live-updates-coverage/gop-raves-about-vance-00168386" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>including
by the VP also-rans</u></a>. But with a direct and easy line to Trump,
Vance would become
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/04/14/want-to-change-trumps-mind-on-policy-be-the-last-one-who-talks-to-him/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>one
of the most influential</u></a> people in America in the case of a
Republican win in November.
</p>
<p>
Even if ESG-bashing is kind of old news, it has the sort of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/trump-evs-politics" target="_self"><u>culture-war
zest</u></a> to it that Rubio’s
<a href="https://www.rubio.senate.gov/rubio-introduces-bills-to-prevent-china-from-flooding-u-s-auto-markets/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>China

sequestration enthusiasm lack</u></a>. It’s the sort of alignment that
makes the ticket seem almost obvious in retrospect — the Trump-Vance
anti-woke, anti-ESG perfect match.

<h2 id="who-is-j.d.-vance-things-to-know-about-trumps-running-mate">Who
is J.D. Vance? Things to know about Trump’s running mate</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio — Former President Donald Trump on Monday chose U.S.
Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio to be his running mate as he looks to return
to the White House.</p>
<p>Here are some things to know about Vance, a 39-year-old Republican
now in his first term in the Senate:</p>
<p>Vance was born and raised in Middletown, Ohio. He joined the Marines
and served in Iraq, and later earned degrees from Ohio State University
and Yale Law School. He also worked as a venture capitalist in Silicon
Valley.</p>
<p>Vance made a name for himself with his memoir, the 2016 bestseller
“Hillbilly Elegy,” which was published as Trump was first running for
president. The book earned Vance a reputation as someone who could help
explain the maverick New York businessman’s appeal in middle America,
and especially among the working class, rural white voters who helped
Trump win the presidency.</p>
<p>“Hillbilly Elegy” also introduced Vance to the Trump family. Donald
Trump Jr. loved the book and knew of Vance when he went to launch his
political career. The two hit it off and have remained friends.</p>
<p>First elected to public office in 2022</p>
<p>After Donald Trump won the 2016 election, Vance returned to his
native Ohio and set up an anti-opioid charity. He also took to the
lecture circuit and was a favored guest at Republican Lincoln Day
dinners where his personal story — including the hardship Vance endured
because of his mother’s drug addiction — resonated.</p>
<p>Vance’s appearances were opportunities to sell his ideas for fixing
the country and helped lay the groundwork for entering politics in 2021,
when he sought the Senate seat vacated by Republican Rob Portman, who
retired.</p>
<p>Trump endorsed Vance. Vance went on to win a crowded Republican
primary and the general election.</p>
<p>Vance went from never-Trumper to fierce ally</p>
<p>Vance was a “never Trump” Republican in 2016. He called Trump
“dangerous” and “unfit” for office. Vance, whose wife, lawyer Usha
Chilukuri Vance, is Indian-American and the mother of their three
children, also criticized Trump’s racist rhetoric, saying he could be
“America’s Hitler.”</p>
<p>But by the time Vance met Trump in 2021, he had reversed his opinion,
citing Trump’s accomplishments as president. Both men downplayed Vance’s
past scathing criticism.</p>
<p>Once elected, Vance became a fierce Trump ally on Capitol Hill,
unceasingly defending Trump’s policies and behavior.</p>
<p>A leading conservative voice</p>
<p>Kevin Roberts, president of the conservative Heritage Foundation,
called Vance a leading voice for the conservative movement, on key
issues including a shift away from interventionist foreign policy, free
market economics and “American culture writ large.”</p>
<p>Democrats call him an extremist, citing provocative positions Vance
has taken but sometimes later amended. Vance signaled support for a
national 15-week abortion ban during his Senate run, for instance, then
softened that stance once Ohio voters overwhelmingly backed a 2023
abortion rights amendment.</p>
<p>On the 2020 election, he said he wouldn’t have certified the results
immediately if he had been vice president and that Trump had “a very
legitimate grievance.” He has put conditions on honoring the results of
the 2024 election that echo Trump’s. A litany of government and outside
investigations have not found any election fraud that could have swung
the outcome of Trump’s 2020 loss to Democratic President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>In the Senate, Vance sometimes embraces bipartisanship. He and
Democratic Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown co-sponsored a railway safety bill
following a fiery train derailment in the Ohio village of East
Palestine. He’s sponsored legislation extending and increasing funding
for the Great Lakes restoration and supported bipartisan legislation
boosting workers and families.</p>
<p>Vance brings strengths at debating, fundraising</p>
<p>People familiar with the vice-presidential vetting process said Vance
would bring to the Republican ticket debating skills, fundraising
prowess and the ability to articulate Trump’s vision.</p>
<p>Charlie Kirk, founder of the conservative activist group Turning
Point USA, said Vance compellingly articulates the America First world
view and could help Trump in states he closely lost in 2020, such as
Michigan and Wisconsin, that share Ohio’s values, demographics and
economy.</p>

id="biden-orders-secret-service-to-protect-rfk-jr.-after-trump-assassination-attempt">Biden
orders Secret Service to protect RFK Jr. after Trump assassination
attempt</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President Joe Biden has directed the U.S. Secret Service
to protect independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,
after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, the Homeland Security
secretary said Monday.</p>
<p>Kennedy is a longshot to win Electoral College votes, much less the
presidency. But his campaign events have drawn large crowds of
supporters and people interested in his message.</p>
<p>Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Biden had
directed the protection for Kennedy “both prior to and after the events
of this past weekend.”</p>
<p>The Secret Service is legally required to protect major party
presidential and vice-presidential candidates and their families 120
days out from a general election, but third-party candidates are on an
as-needed basis.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security acknowledged in its 2024 budget
overview that recent requests for candidate protection were coming in
earlier than in the past.</p>
<p>Threats to political candidates are common, but law enforcement
officials have said that there has been an uptick in violent rhetoric
since the weekend attack at the Trump rally. Mayorkas said both Biden
and Trump are “constantly the subject of threats.”</p>
<p>“We are in a heightened and very dynamic threat environment,” he
said. </p>
<p>With a famous name and a loyal base, Kennedy has the potential to do
better than any third-party presidential candidate since Ross Perot in
the 1990s. But he didn’t participate in the first presidential debate on
June 27. Both the Biden and Trump campaigns, who fear he could be a
spoiler, bypassed the nonpartisan debate commission and agreed to a
schedule that essentially left out Kennedy.</p>
<p>Kennedy, who last year challenged Biden for the Democratic nomination
before launching an independent bid, has argued that his relatively
strong showing in a few national polls gives his candidacy heft. Polls
during the 2016 presidential campaign regularly put libertarian Gary
Johnson’s support in the high single or low double digits, but he
ultimately received only about 3% of the vote nationwide.</p>
<p>Trump became the official Republican presidential nominee Monday
after receiving the votes of enough delegates at the Republican National
Convention. He was not seriously injured in the shooting over the
weekend in Pennsylvania. There is an independent review of the attack
underway.</p>
<p>Mayorkas said Trump’s protection has been enhanced based on the
“evolving nature of the threats to the former president” and his shift
from presumptive nominee to nominee.</p>

id="i-told-you-so-mozilla-working-with-facebook-to-weaken-firefox-privacy-and-anti-tracking-features">I
told you so: Mozilla working with Facebook to weaken Firefox’ privacy
and anti-tracking features</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>I’ve long been warning about the dangers of relying on just one
browser as the bullwark against the onslaught of Chrome, Chrome skins,
and Safari. With Firefox’ user numbers rapidly declining, now stuck at a
mere 2% or so – and even less on mobile – and regulatory pressure
possibly ending the Google-Mozilla deal with makes up roughly 80% of
Mozilla’s income, I’ve been warning that Mozilla will most likely have
to start making Firefox worse to gain more temporary revenue. As the
situation possibly grows even more dire, Firefox for Linux would be the
first on the chopping block. I’ve received quite a bit of backlash over
expressing these worries, but over the course of the last year or so
we’ve been seeing my fears slowly become reality before our very eyes,
culminating in Mozilla recently acquiring an online advertising
analytics company. Over the last few days, things have become even
worse: with the release of Firefox 128, the enshitification of Firefox
has now well and truly begun. Less than a month after acquiring the
AdTech company Anonym, Mozilla has added special software co-authored by
Meta and built for the advertising industry directly to the latest
release of Firefox, in an experimental trial you have to opt out of
manually. This “Privacy-Preserving Attribution” (PPA) API adds another
tool to the arsenal of tracking features that advertisers can use, which
is thwarted by traditional content blocking extensions. ↫ Jonah Aragon
If you have already upgraded to Firefox 128, you have automatically been
opted into using this new API, and for now, you can still opt-out by
going to Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Website Advertising
Preferences, and remove the checkmark “Allow websites to perform
privacy-preserving ad measurement”. You were opted in without your
consent, without any widespread announcement, and if it wasn’t for so
many Firefox users being on edge about Mozilla’s recent behaviour, it
might not have been snuffed out this quickly. Over on GitHub, there’s a
more in-depth description of this new API, and the first few words are
something you never want to hear from an organisation that claims to
fight tracking and protect your privacy: “Mozilla is working with Meta”.
I’m not surprised by this at all – like I, perhaps gleefully, pointed
out, I’ve been warning about this eventuality for a long time – but I’ve
noted that on the wider internet, a lot of people were very much
unpleasently surprised, feeling almost betrayed by this, the latest in a
series of dubious moves by Mozilla. It’s not even just the fact they’re
“working with Meta”, which is entirely disqualifying in and of itself,
but also the fact there’s zero transparency or accountability about this
new API towards Firefox’ users. Sure, we’re all technologically inclined
and follow technology news closely, but the vast majority of people
don’t, and there’s bound to be countless people who perhaps only
recently moved to Firefox from Chrome for privacy reasons, only to be
stabbed in the back by Mozilla partnering up with Facebook, of all
companies, if they even find out about this at all. It’s right out of
Facebook’s playbook to secretly experiment on users. This is what I
wrote a year ago: I’m genuinely worried about the state of browsers on
Linux, and the future of Firefox on Linux in particular. I think it’s
highly irresponsible of the various prominent players in the desktop
Linux community, from GNOME to KDE, from Ubuntu to Fedora, to seemingly
have absolutely zero contingency plans for when Firefox enshittifies or
dies, despite everything we know about the current state of the browser
market, the state of Mozilla’s finances, and the future prospects of
both. Desktop Linux has a Firefox problem, but nobody seems willing to
acknowledge it. ↫ Thom Holwerda It seems my warnings are turning into
reality one by one, and if, at this point, you’re still not worried
about where you’re going to go after Firefox starts integrating even
more Facebook technologies or Firefox for Linux gets ever more resources
pulled away from it until it eventually gets cancelled, you’re
blind.</p>

AMD Zen 5 microarchitecture: powering Ryzen AI 300 series for mobile and
Ryzen 9000 for desktop</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Built around the new Zen 5 CPU microarchitecture with some
fundamental improvements to both graphics and AI performance, the Ryzen
AI 300 series, code-named Strix Point, is set to deliver improvements in
several areas. The Ryzen AI 300 series looks set to add another footnote
in the march towards the AI PC with its mobile SoC featuring a new XDNA
2 NPU, from which AMD promises 50 TOPS of performance. AMD has also
upgraded the integrated graphics with the RDNA 3.5, which is designed to
replace the last generation of RDNA 3 mobile graphics, for better
performance in games than we’ve seen before. Further to this, during
AMD’s recent Tech Day last week, AMD disclosed some of the technical
details regarding Zen 5, which also covers a number of key elements
under the hood on both the Ryzen AI 300 and the Ryzen 9000 series. On
paper, the Zen 5 architecture looks quite a big step up compared to Zen
4, with the key component driving Zen 5 forward through higher
instructions per cycle than its predecessor, which is something AMD has
managed to do consistently from Zen to Zen 2, Zen 3, Zen 4, and now Zen
5. ↫ Gavin Bonshor at AnandTech Not the review and deep analysis quite
yet, but a first thorough look at what Zen 5 is going to bring us,
straight from AnandTech.</p>

<h2 id="the-hydrogen-tax-credit-rules-are-effectively-dead">The Hydrogen
Tax Credit Rules Are Effectively Dead</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjY2NzQwOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczNTQ0MDQwM30.YykibJQHawMYGn4PVj7qBYJVA5-O0iOTntB7T75D-fQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Few aspects of Biden’s climate law have spurred more controversy than
the “three pillars” — a set of rules proposed by the Treasury Department
for how to claim a lucrative new tax credit for producing clean
hydrogen. Now, it appears, the pillars may be poised to fall.
</p>
<p>
The Treasury has been under immense pressure from Congress, energy
companies, and even
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/doe-sides-with-industry-on-hydrogen-tax-rules/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>leaders
at the Department of Energy</u></a> to relax the rules since before it
even published the proposal in December. The pillars, criteria designed
to prevent the program from subsidizing projects that increase U.S.
greenhouse gas emissions rather than reduce them, are too expensive and
complicated to comply with, detractors argue, and would sink the
prospects for a domestic clean hydrogen industry.
</p>
<p>
But lately, the campaign to dismantle the pillars has gotten both more
forceful and more threatening. There’s the politically challenging
hurdle that leaders of another federally-funded hydrogen program — the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/hydrogen-hubs-biden-pennsylvania-california-texas" target="_self"><u>regional
clean hydrogen hubs</u></a> — have spoken out against the rules, arguing
they threaten investment in hub projects and therefore job creation and
economic development around the country. Then there’s the recent
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/supreme-court-loper-corner-post" target="_self"><u>Supreme
Court decision</u></a> to overturn the precedent known as Chevron
deference, which weakened agencies’ ability to defend their own rules
and thereby emboldens any aggrieved parties to sue the Treasury if it
keeps the pillars in place. Last week, 13 Democratic Senators, 11 of
whom hail from states involved in the hubs, sent a
<a href="https://www.padilla.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/7.10.24-Letter-to-Secretary-Yellen-Section-45V-Credit-for-Production-of-Clean-Hydrogen.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>letter</u></a>
calling on Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to dramatically revise the
rules or risk having them challenged in court.
</p>
<p>
The consequences of losing the three pillars can only be guessed at
using models, which are built on assumptions and can’t predict the
future with certainty. But proponents say the stakes couldn’t be higher.
In their view, the pillars don’t just prevent carbon emissions. They
mitigate the risks of rising electricity costs for everyday Americans.
And without them, one of the most generous energy credits the government
offers could become incredibly easy to claim, ballooning the federal
budget.
</p>
<p>
The clean hydrogen tax credit was created by the Inflation Reduction
Act, and offers up to $3 per kilogram of hydrogen produced, with the top
dollar amount reserved for fuel that is essentially zero-emissions. The
hope was that this would be enough to bring down the cost of hydrogen
made from electricity to parity with hydrogen made from natural gas. If
made cleanly, hydrogen could help decarbonize other carbon-intensive
industries, like steelmaking and shipping.
</p>
<p>
At first, excitement for the tax credit ran high and companies quickly
began making plans for new factories. Announcements of new hydrogen
production capacity more than tripled from 2 million tons per year in
2021 to 7.7 million by the end of the following year, with another 6
million announced in 2023, according to the energy consulting firm Wood
Mackenzie.
</p>
<p>
Then, after the Treasury’s proposal dropped last December, everything
stopped. Under the three pillars, hydrogen companies that get
electricity from the grid, which is still largely powered by fossil
fuels, would be required to buy clean energy credits with specific
attributes in order to mitigate their emissions and render their
hydrogen “clean.” The credits must come from power plants located in the
same region as the hydrogen production — the first pillar — that were
built no more than 3 years before the hydrogen plant — the second pillar
— and be purchased for every hour the plant is operating — the third
pillar.
</p>
<p>
The three provisions work together to ensure that new clean power plants
are brought online to meet hydrogen’s energy demand. But finding clean
energy credits with these features is not easy — there aren’t many
systems in place to do this yet. The Treasury took more than a year to
publish its initial proposal, and leading up to it, companies lobbied
aggressively for a more lenient version. There was so much money on the
line that some businesses flooded the public with ads in newspapers and
on streaming and podcast services delivering a cryptic warning that
“additionality” — the requirement to buy energy from new power plants —
was threatening to “set America back.”
</p>
<p>
Until businesses have clarity on whether the three pillars will stay or
go, the industry is on ice. Several previously announced projects have
been delayed. Few companies have reached offtake agreements, even
provisional ones, for their hydrogen. Almost none have received a final
investment decision or started construction.
</p>
<p>
“They’re losing advantage over other parts of the world,” Hector
Arreola, a principal analyst for hydrogen and emerging technologies at
Wood Mackenzie, told me. Momentum to develop hydrogen projects has
started to shift back to Europe, which has already finalized its own
definition of what constitutes clean hydrogen, he said.
</p>
<p>
It’s hard to imagine a path forward for the Treasury to keep the three
pillars intact. Last week’s letter outlined the current state of play in
stark terms. “Without significant changes to the draft guidance,” it
said, “one of the most powerful job creation and emission reduction
tools in the IRA will likely be hamstrung by future court challenges,
congressional opposition, and unfulfilled private sector investment.”
</p>
<p>
Indeed, at least one company, Constellation Energy, has already
<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/constellation-prepared-to-visit-with-the-courts-about-proposed-hydrogen-t/713551/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>suggested
it would draw on the loss of Chevron deference</u></a> to sue the agency
if it didn’t remove the second pillar — the requirement to buy clean
energy credits from recently-built power plants. (Constellation owns a
fleet of nuclear power plants and is developing hydrogen projects
powered by them.) In
<a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/IRS-2023-0066-29539" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>comments</u></a>
to the Treasury, Constellation wrote that the requirements for
purchasing clean electricity “have no basis” in the law.
</p>
<p>
“People can always sue today to challenge regulations,” Keith Martin, a
renewable energy tax lawyer at the firm Norton Rose Fulbright, told me.
“It’s just that the odds of success have increased.” The Supreme Court’s
ruling undermines regulatory agencies’ authority to interpret federal
statute.
</p>
<p>
Another hydrogen company that has been fighting the three pillars, Plug
Power, has already claimed victory: It put out a
<a href="https://www.ir.plugpower.com/press-releases/news-details/2024/Plug-to-Receive-Federal-Clean-Hydrogen-Production-Tax-Credit-at-Georgia-Hydrogen-Facility/default.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>press
release</u></a> last month declaring that it anticipates receiving the
tax credit, despite the fact that the rules are still not final and its
projects would likely not qualify under Treasury’s proposal. The CEO,
Andy Marsh, told a hydrogen trade publication that he’s
<a href="https://www.h2-view.com/story/plug-power-ceo-certain-45v-hydrogen-tax-credit-rules-will-be-relaxed/2110336.article/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>“certain”
the rules will be loosened</u></a>. (Plug Power didn’t respond to a
request for clarification by publish time.)
</p>
<p>
In their letter, the 13 Democratic senators propose that hydrogen
producers should be able to purchase clean energy from existing power
plants that are already supplying the grid if they are located in a
state that has a clean energy standard, or as long as the power plant
doesn’t reallocate more than 10% of its power to hydrogen production.
They recommend losing the hourly matching requirement altogether and
replacing it with annual or monthly matching, depending on when plants
start construction. The senators also suggest allowing projects built in
areas with “insufficient clean energy sources,” meaning places with
suboptimal sun, wind, water, or geothermal energy, to source their power
from farther outside the region.
</p>
<p>
Beth Deane, the chief legal officer for Electric Hydrogen, a company
that has historically supported the three pillars, told me in an
interview she thought these proposals represented a good compromise.
“Bottom-line, the effectiveness of green hydrogen as a decarbonization
tool is being artificially held back,” she said later in an email. “We
need to give up perfection on both sides of the three-pillar debate and
find the ‘good enough’ solution that lets early mover projects move
forward with less stringent requirements.”
</p>
<p>
But other proponents told me the letter carves out so many loopholes
that the pillars would remain in name only. Rachel Fakhry, the policy
director for emerging technologies at the Natural Resources Defense
Council, told me the letter was “outrageous” and “a giveaway buffet.”
Daniel Esposito, a manager in the electricity program at the think tank
Energy Innovation, told me he can’t imagine any scenario where these
exceptions don’t result in an emissions boost rather than a reduction.
</p>
<p>
That’s because the electrolyzers used to produce clean hydrogen consume
a lot of power and are expected to cause fossil fuel plants — which are
more flexible than renewables — to run more often and stay open longer
than they otherwise would. Without a requirement to buy power from new
clean sources and a prescription to match operations with clean energy
throughout the day, there will be no demand signals to bring (often more
expensive) clean resources onto the grid that can, for example, produce
power at night when solar panels aren’t generating. Power system models

Innovation</u></a>,
<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/acacb5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Princeton
University researchers</u></a>, the
<a href="https://rhg.com/research/clean-hydrogen-45v-tax-guidance/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Rhodium
Group</u></a>, and the
<a href="https://www.epri.com/research/products/000000003002028407" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Electric
Power Research Institute</u></a> have all found that there could be
significant emissions consequences if the three pillars were relaxed in
ways suggested in the letter.
</p>
<p>
“This effectively unlocks more than 10 million metric tons of dirty
electrolytic hydrogen,” Esposito said, based on some
back-of-the-envelope estimates. That would cost something like $30
billion per year. Put another way, he said, every $300 paid out by this
program could subsidize one ton of CO2 emissions. Put a third way, he
added, it could set the U.S. back two to three percentage points on its
commitment under the Paris Agreement to reduce emissions 50% to 52% by
2030 — and we’re
<a href="https://rhg.com/research/taking-stock-2023/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>already
off track</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
The authors of the letter say they’re “confident” these fears are
overblown. They cite a competing
<a href="https://acore.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ACORE-and-E3-Analysis-of-Hourly-and-Annual-GHG-Emissions-Accounting-for-Hydrogen-Production.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>analysis</u></a>
published last year by the consulting firm Energy and Environmental
Economics and paid for by the trade group the American Council on
Renewable Energy, which found that requiring companies to match their
operations with clean energy on an hourly basis, rather than an annual
basis, does not ensure lower greenhouse gas emissions<em><em>.</em></em>
They also cite
<a href="https://www.cmu.edu/energy/key-initiatives/open-energy-outlook/fueling-change-understanding-the-impacts-of-the-proposed-rule-for-hydrogen-tax-credits-on-greenhouse-gas-emissions.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>research
by an energy modeling group at Carnegie Mellon</u></a> and North
Carolina State University, which found that the difference in cumulative
emissions between scenarios with less stringent requirements and the
full three pillars comes out to less than 1% by 2039.
</p>
<p>
Paulina Jaramillo, a professor of engineering and public policy at
Carnegie Mellon who worked on that research, told me the three pillars
add a level of regulatory complexity to hydrogen production that is not
worth the cost in terms of the emissions savings. In general, she said,
she saw no need for the rules, and that the Treasury should subsidize
electrolytic hydrogen regardless of where the electricity comes from.
“We need to deploy this infrastructure,” Jaramillo told me. “We need to
deploy it now so it’s available later.”
</p>
<p>
The other camp of researchers disputed Jaramillo’s group’s findings,
chalking them up to a series of differences in assumptions and approach.
They also call the industry’s bluff on the claim that the three pillars
are too hard and expensive to comply with. Esposito pointed out that a
small group of hydrogen companies has already
<a href="https://hystorenergy.com/section-45v-notice-of-proposed-rulemaking/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told
the Treasury</u></a> that if the rules were finalized as-is, they
planned to build enough capacity to produce more than 6 million tons of
hydrogen per year.
</p>
<p>
Fakhry argued that we are already seeing the risks of losing the three
pillars play out in real time as power-hungry industries like bitcoin
mining and artificial intelligence grow. Bitcoin mines have
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/09/business/bitcoin-mining-electricity-pollution.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>driven
up emissions</u></a> and
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02221" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>energy
costs</u></a> around the country. Utilities in Pennsylvania are sounding
the alarm that an Amazon data center seeking to divert power from an
existing nuclear power plant could
<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/aep-exelon-pjm-interconnection-amazon-data-center-talen-ferc-isa/719869/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>shift
up to $140 million</u></a> in costs to other electricity customers. As I
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/biden-hydrogen-hubs-department-energy" target="_self"><u>wrote
in Heatmap last year</u></a>, this debate is not just about hydrogen —
think of all the other energy-intensive industries that will have to
electrify before we can reach net zero.
</p>
<p>
Plenty of stakeholders still believe that the Treasury can find a middle
ground by making the three pillars more flexible. The American Clean
Power Association, which represents a wide range of energy companies,
has proposed
<a href="https://cleanpower.org/resources/45v-time-matching-acp-proposal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>loosening
the hourly matching aspect</u></a> for projects that start construction
before 2028. Fakhry acknowledged the need for flexibility, but her
recommendations are much more narrow than the senators’. For example,
she would allow hydrogen producers to buy power from existing nuclear
plants, but only if they are at risk of retirement and the purchase
would help keep them open. Esposito said Energy Innovation would support
power procurement from existing clean resources that are curtailed,
meaning they produce power that currently goes unutilized.
</p>
<p>
Both Fakry and Esposito also downplayed the threat of lawsuits, arguing
that Treasury did exactly what it was instructed to do by the law. The
IRA specifically says that hydrogen emissions should be calculated per a
section of the Clean Air Act that says any accounting should include
“significant indirect emissions.” Treasury has interpreted this to
include the induced emissions caused by a hydrogen plant, and received
letters of support from the
<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/45V-NPRM-EPA-letter.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Environmental
Protection Agency</u></a> and
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-12/Assessing_Lifecycle_Greenhouse_Gas_Emissions_Associated_with_Electricity_Use_for_the_Section_45V_Clean_Hydrogen_Production_Tax_Credit.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Department
of Energy</u></a> backing this interpretation.
</p>
<p>
However, as Martin, the tax lawyer, told me, by overturning Chevron
deference, the Supreme Court has just given “677 federal district court
judges greater latitude to substitute their own judgment for subject
matter experts at the federal agencies.”
</p>
<p>
Asked for comment on the Senators’ letter, a Treasury spokesperson told
me the agency is still considering the many thousands of comments the
agency received on the proposed rules. “The Biden Administration is
committed to ensuring that progress continues and that the IRA’s
investments continue to create good-paying jobs, lower energy costs, and
strengthen energy security.”
</p>
<p>
Even if Yellen heeds the Senators’ advice, the department may not be
able to avoid a lawsuit. “We will use every tool available to us —
including the courts — to either defend a strong final rule or challenge
an unlawful one that reflects the asks in the letter,” Fakhry told me.
</p>
<p>
There’s also a realpolitik argument here that the industry might want
this all to be over more than it wants to kill the three pillars. “The
number one thing people want is business certainty,” Esposito told me.
“I don’t think people want this to drag on for another two years.”

Shawn Schulze, CEO of the American Red Cross Texas Gulf Coast Region,
has been driving around Texas to coordinate relief efforts after
Hurricane Beryl. On Sunday, he pulled over in his car to talk to me
about what the situation is like on the ground.
</p>
<p>
A week ago, power outages caused by the hurricane pushed over 2 million
Texans into the dark during a record-breaking heat wave, seeing heat
indexes above 100 degrees Fahrenheit throughout all of last week.
<strong>As of yesterday, utility CenterPoint Energy — which has drawn
criticism from many, including
</strong><a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/hurricane/2024/07/14/493450/houston-power-outages-abbott-says-centerpoint-must-formulate-storm-plans-as-thousands-without-power/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>Governor
Greg Abbott</strong></u></a><strong>, over its response to the hurricane
— had yet to restore power to over 320,000 clients.</strong> Schulze, a
life-long Houston resident, got his electricity back on Sunday.
</p>
<p>
Volunteers are even more in need as hospitals in Texas struggle to meet
demand. Dr. Owais Durrani told
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/13/us/video/houston-heat-wave-power-outage-doctor-intv-digvid" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>CNN</u></a>
that <strong>hospital crowding in Houston is approaching levels not seen
since the COVID-19 pandemic</strong>. To ameliorate the conditions in
Texas, around 600 Red Cross volunteers from across the nation are
stationed in Houston, providing thousands of hot meals, ice, and water,
beyond helping maintain 16 emergency shelters.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Looking Ahead: </strong>Later this week, an increased chance of
rain and thunderstorms might help keep temperatures near average,
alleviating some of the intense heat, AccuWeather Meteorologist Alex
DaSilva told me. But the rain might also delay relief and reconstruction
efforts in the wake of Beryl. “We’re going to continue to help people
until the need stops,” Schulze said.

</ul>
<h3>
Cities in California break heat records, while farmers struggle to
sustain production
</h3>
<p>
Northern California’s <strong> Stockton and Modesto hit 110 and 108
degrees respectively on Friday, surpassing records set in 1999.
Sacramento has also now experienced its highest number of days above 110
degrees in a year.</strong> Also last week, temperatures in the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/death-valley-temperature-tourism" target="_self"><u>Death
Valley</u></a> inched closer to 134 degrees — the hottest temperature
ever recorded on Earth.
</p>
<p>
The dry and hot weather has been of particular concern for farmers in
the state, which are struggling to meet demand. “The heat is really
taking its toll on the people and our crops,” Garrett Patricio,
president of Westside Produce in Northern California, told me.
<strong>Due to the heat, crops are reaching maturity earlier and work
days are being cut short to protect the health of workers</strong>,
driving up the costs of production.

<h3>
Unprecedented wildfires with more to come
</h3>
<p>
On Thursday, <em><em>The Guardian</em></em>
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/11/california-wildfires-burn-damage" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a>
that <strong>wildfires in California have already burned five times the
average area for this time of year</strong>. Communities in Oregon and
New Mexico have also burned this summer. On Friday, Oregon Governor Tina
Kotek declared a state of emergency as wildfires continue to scorch
through the state.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Looking Ahead:</strong> While monsoon activity will continue in
the West, the amount of moisture available in the air will decrease,
increasing the risk for thunderstorms that could spark new blazes this
week.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Death toll rises
</h3>
<p>
The number of heat-related deaths this summer continues to climb, with
most being reported in California and Oregon. In the past week, at least
28 people died, <em><em>The Washington Post</em></em>
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/07/10/heat-wave-us-death-toll/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a>.
That number has already grown.<strong> On Friday, Oregon
</strong><a href="https://www.klcc.org/health-medicine/2024-07-12/death-toll-from-oregon-heat-wave-continues-to-climb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>announced</strong></u></a><strong>
two more deaths, bringing its number up to 16. </strong>
</p>
<h3>
More record-breaking heat heading east
</h3>
<p>
<strong>Through Wednesday, the mid-Atlantic and Northeast can expect
temperatures up to 12 degrees above the historical average for this time
of the year.</strong> According to DaSilva, areas near Washington, D.C.
and Baltimore might experience temperatures higher than 100 degrees.
“Other areas in the Northeast can be in the 90s,” he told me. On Sunday,
Boston Mayor Michelle Wu
<a href="https://www.boston.gov/news/mayor-wu-declares-heat-emergency-july-15-17-opens-cooling-centers-all-residents#:~:text=To%20All%20Residents-,Mayor%20Wu%20Declares%20Heat%20Emergency%20July%2015%20%2D%2017%3B%20Opens%20Cooling,the%20upcoming%20extreme%20weather%20forecasts." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>declared</u></a>
a heat emergency in the city until July 17.
</p>
<p>
In the later portion of the week, DaSilva predicts that <strong>a cold
front will bring temperatures in the Northeast closer to — and in some
areas even below — average.</strong> But, the change to a “cooler and
less humid air mass,” might also bring along severe weather such as
thunderstorms and heavy rainfall.
</p>
<h3>
Drought conditions to persist in the South
</h3>
<p>
There’s good news and bad news for communities in the Southwest and
across the Southeast, which have faced severe dry conditions.
<strong>While no drought-busting rains are expected for this week,
“pop-up thunderstorms on a daily basis can provide localized benefits
through midweek” in the Southeast, DaSilva told me.</strong> A potential
cold front later this week could increase the chance of rain and further
benefit the region’s current conditions.
</p>
<h3>
Arab nations will struggle with heat, poor air quality
</h3>
<p>
Several Arab nations, including Iraq, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia, were hit
by an
<a href="https://www.newarab.com/news/heatwave-threatens-iraq-gulf-nations-50degc-and-above?amp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>intense
heat wave</u></a> in early July, and extreme temperatures are expected
to persist through this week. <strong>Amarah in Iraq, for example, might
hit 127 degrees on Saturday, and most major cities in the country will
see temperatures well above 110 multiple times this week.</strong> The
weather conditions in the region are even more dangerous due to
increased dust activity, causing the air quality to hit unhealthy
levels.
</p>
<h3>
Some relief heading toward northern Europe
</h3>
<p>
Poland’s top oil refineries have struggled to hit their production
targets due to intense heat, <em><em>Bloomberg</em></em>
<a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/2024/07/11/searing-heat-triggers-fuel-supply-worries-at-oil-refineries-in-europe-and-beyond/#:~:text=(Bloomberg)%20--%20Temperatures%20in%20Europe,104F" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a>.
Other countries in the region such as Austria, the Czech Republic, and
Slovakia, were
under<a href="https://crisis24.garda.com/alerts/2024/07/europe-high-temperatures-forecast-across-parts-of-east-central-europe-through-at-least-july-14" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>
heat warnings</u></a> the past few days, but this week will offer
slightly lower temperatures. <strong>Highs are expected to be around the
low 80s, but some days can see temperatures up to 90 degrees. </strong>

<p>
As people process news of the attempted assassination of former
President Donald Trump, some of that processing may occur at work. And
the workplace — like the rest of America — is a polarized place. Today,
we’re joined by Johnny C. Taylor, Jr., president and CEO of the Society
for Human Resource Management, to hear how managers can guide healthy
conversations over differing political viewpoints. Plus: a pulse check
on China’s economy.

The Republican National Convention will go ahead as planned in

A new survey released today from nonprofit research institution

Insights 2024</a> report is that the public’s views on the issue “have
remained remarkably steady” since the group’s first survey in 1997. Most
respondents believe, as they did 27 years ago, that the Earth’s
temperature is warming (75%) and that human activity is at least partly
to blame (83%). But a few things <em><em>have</em></em> changed over the
years:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Americans feel they know more about climate change.
</strong>Today 73% of respondents say they know “at least a moderate
amount” about the issue compared to 42% in 1997.
</li>
<li>
<strong>More people see climate as their top issue. </strong>Twenty-one
percent of Americans care deeply about climate change, pay attention to
the news about the issue, and are likely to vote based on candidates’
climate policies. That’s up from 9% in 1997.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Confidence in government action has risen recently.
</strong>Today, 51% of Americans say the federal government is
addressing climate change, up from 44% in 2020.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Attitudes about renewables have shifted since 2013, and not
necessarily in a good way. </strong>A majority of people still favor
wind and solar power but their enthusiasm is wavering: Support for solar
is down from 91% to 83%; support for wind is down from 84% to 70%.
</li>
<li>
<strong>More Americans support nuclear, aren’t sure about coal, and
dislike natural gas</strong>. Support for nuclear power has risen from
33% to 44%. On the flip side, support for natural gas has declined 10
percentage points to just 38%. Americans’ attitudes about coal haven’t
changed much but remain unfavorable – only 18% said they think coal
should be used to make electricity.

Nim</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>I decided to document my journey of writing an OS in Nim. Why Nim?
It’s one of the few languages that allow low-level systems programming
with deterministic memory management (garbage collector is optional)
with destructors and move semantics. It’s also statically typed, which
provides greater type safety. It also supports inline assembly, which is
a must for OS development. Other options include C, C++, Rust, and Zig.
They’re great languages, but I chose Nim for its simplicity, elegance,
and performance. ↫ Fusion OS documentation website I love it when a
hobby operating system project not only uses a less common programming
language, but the author also details the entire development process in
great detail. It’s not a UNIX-like, and the goals are a single 64 bit
address space, capability-based security model, and a lot more. It’s
targeting UEFI machines, and the code is, of course, open source and
available on GitHub.</p>

id="trump-rally-shooting-becomes-hot-topic-on-chinas-social-media">Trump
rally shooting becomes hot topic on China’s social media</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Taipei, Taiwan — The shooting at a rally for former President Donald
Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday quickly became a trending
topic on China’s social media platforms Sunday.</p>
<p>The Chinese foreign ministry released a statement on its website
Sunday, indicating that the country is closely following the incident
involving Trump.</p>
<p>“President Xi Jinping has expressed sympathies to former President
Trump,” the Chinese foreign ministry said in its statement.</p>
<p>The FBI said Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, a resident of Bethel Park,
Pennsylvania, was the suspect in the attempted assassination of
Trump.</p>
<p>As of noon, Beijing time Sunday, the Weibo entry “Trump was shot” had
garnered more than 300 million views, making it the top trending topic
on the platform. Weibo, a Chinese social media platform similar to X,
formerly Twitter, mirrors trends seen on international platforms like X,
which is banned in China.</p>
<p>Not only did the entry “Trump was shot” dominate Weibo’s trending
topics, but at one point, half of the top 20 searches were related to
the shooting. Updates such as “Trump’s right ear was shot through by a
bullet,” “One person died at the scene,” and “The shooting suspect was
killed,” along with U.S. President Joe Biden’s responses, also garnered
significant attention.</p>
<p>Fast reaction came also from Chinese businesses: By noon Sunday in
Beijing, shopping websites like Taobao and Pinduoduo listed T-shirts
featuring images of Trump raising his arms after being injured. Some
internet commenters jokingly remarked, “This is the speed of Chinese
e-commerce.”</p>
<p>Major state media outlets, including Xinhua News Agency and CCTV,
extensively covered the shooting.</p>
<p>Many Chinese experts interviewed said they believed that the
assassination attempt was genuine and speculated that it could
positively influence Trump’s campaign.</p>
<p>Chinese social media was also rife with speculation that the shooting
was “self-directed and self-staged.”</p>
<p>Notably, Jin Hao, former executive editor of Xinhua News Agency’s
“World Military,” commented on Weibo, saying that, after looking at the
clips from the scene and observing Trump’s “remarkably swift” reaction,
“he [knew he] was shot as soon as he touched his ears and immediately
crouched down.” Jin remarked, “This isn’t something that ordinary people
can react to.”</p>
<p>Some Weibo users also echoed that “it has been practiced hundreds of
times.”</p>
<p>However, this conspiracy theory faced criticism from many bloggers,
and others who argued that Trump’s ear injury was just a few centimeters
away from the brain.</p>
<p>Even Jin Canrong, a professor at the School of International
Relations at Renmin University of China, known for his strong
anti-American stance, bluntly stated in an interview with the
Shanghai-based media Observer Net that this incident was “an
assassination.”</p>
<p>Jin noted that in the photos from the scene, the injured Trump raised
his hands in a fighting gesture, surrounded by Secret Service agents and
the American flag, effectively creating a heroic image for himself.</p>
<p>Currently based in California, Albert Chiu, a political science
professor at Taiwan’s Tunghai University, said in an interview with VOA
that Trump was shot during a live broadcast, and the shooter was killed
on the scene, making it hard for any “conspiracy theory” to take hold.
He emphasized that the ongoing culture of political assassination in the
United States warrants more attention.</p>
<p>According to He Yue, a member of the National Union of Journalists in
the United Kingdom, the enthusiasm of Chinese netizens for discussing
the shooting reflects daily restrictions on free speech, where “domestic
politics is off-limits.” They can only engage openly when negative
topics related to American democracy arise, He Yue said.</p>
<p>Because “Chinese netizens really cannot discuss Chinese politics,
when it comes to other countries’ political events, like the shooting,
it feels like they’ve found an outlet to vent,” he told VOA. “The most
heated discussions revolve around whether this is a ploy and who
orchestrated it. Chinese people have lived in a world of falsehoods for
too long; everything feels fake, so they use this mindset to judge
foreigners.”</p>
<p>Taiwan’s reaction</p>
<p>On Sunday, Chen Shui-bian, former Taiwanese president who was shot
while campaigning for reelection two decades ago, pointed out in
interviews with several Taiwanese media outlets that the locations of
both shootings — his in Tainan, in southern Taiwan, and Trump’s in
Butler, Pennsylvania — can be seen as “sacred places of democracy” for
both countries. Each attack resulted in minor injuries to presidential
candidates, which he characterized as “a striking coincidence.”</p>
<p>One day before the 2004 Taiwan presidential election, the “319
shooting incident” occurred. President Chen was shot while campaigning
in a jeep in Tainan. The bullet only caused a minor abdominal injury
after penetrating his clothing.</p>
<p>The Presidential Office of Taiwan stated Sunday, “President (Lai
Ching-te) extends sincere concerns to former President Trump and prays
for his speedy recovery.” Lai strongly condemned any form of political
violence and expressed his deepest condolences to all victims.</p>
<p>Eric Chu, chairman of the China-friendly opposition Kuomintang party,
also stated in an interview that he promptly expressed condolences to
the U.S. side, hoping for former President Trump’s swift recovery, and
emphasizing the party’s condemnation of political violence.</p>

convention protests are on despite shooting at Trump rally</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MILWAUKEE — Activists gathering in Milwaukee for the start of the
Republican National Convention say the assassination attempt on former
President Donald Trump won’t affect their long-standing plans to
demonstrate outside the convention site this week.</p>
<p>A diverse range of organizations and activists is expected outside
the downtown Fiserv Forum. The largest expected demonstration was slated
to start Monday morning.</p>
<p>The Coalition to March on the RNC, comprised largely of local groups,
planned to protest for access to abortion rights, for immigrant rights,
and against the war in Gaza among other issues.</p>
<p>“The shooting has nothing to do with us,” said Omar Flores, a
coalition spokesman, speaking about the Saturday evening shots fired at
Trump during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. “We’re going to continue
with the march as we planned.”</p>
<p>The U.S. Secret Service has said security plans — in the works for
more than a year — remain the same after the Saturday shooting in which
Trump has said his ear was pierced by a bullet and images show blood
streaming from a wound. A nearby audience member was fatally shot and
two others critically injured in the assault, which has prompted
widespread calls to evaluate security measures.</p>
<p>The progressive coalition protesting the RNC has touted their Monday
demonstrations as “family friendly.”</p>
<p>Organizers expect an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 attendees. Separately,
the Philadelphia-based Poor People’s Army, which organizes for economic
justice, plans an afternoon march. Smaller organizations also plan to
demonstrate inside parks closer to the convention site where Trump is
set to officially accept the party’s presidential nomination later this
week.</p>
<p>Milwaukee’s leaders reiterated their confidence in security plans
Sunday as delegates, activists and journalists started arriving in town.
An estimated 30,000 people are expected.</p>
<p>Trump arrived in Milwaukee on Sunday.</p>
<p>“We take this matter very, very seriously. We take public safety
very, very seriously,” Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said Sunday.
“And I have been so pleased to work in collaboration not just with the
United States Secret Service but also with local law enforcement and
public safety on the ground here.”</p>
<p>Police Chief Jeffrey Norman said law enforcement was “working around
the clock” to be ready.</p>
<p>Before the shooting in Pennsylvania, the activist coalition had been
at odds with the city and law enforcement for months over a march route.
Activists lost a lawsuit over restrictions on where they could
demonstrate and had raised concerns about their message being
stifled.</p>
<p>But on Friday they announced a “handshake agreement” over their route
that includes allowing a city representative to accompany their protest
to “make sure things go without a hitch.”</p>
<p>City officials and federal authorities have repeatedly said their
priority is safety and insist they’ve made free speech
accommodations.</p>
<p>The city has allowed protests at two parks near the convention. One,
Haymarket Square Park, is visible from the convention site. There is to
be a city-provided stage in the vicinity and speakers will get 20
minutes apiece. A city sign-up lists more than 100 people with a wide
range of agendas, including anti-abortion rights activists, veterans
groups and political candidates. The other park, Zeidler Union Square,
is just under a mile away.</p>
<p>Activists say they’ll infuse their messages with moments of levity,
including costumes and a television ventriloquist who is bringing a
Trump puppet.</p>
<p>Heavy police presence is also assured.</p>
<p>Many activists are using the experience in Milwaukee to prepare for
the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month. That event is
expected to draw even more people, and Chicago police have been
undergoing training on constitutional policing and preparing for the
possibility of mass arrests.</p>
<p>Milwaukee police have done some exercises related to the convention,
though not widespread training.</p>
<p>“With any very large gathering, people must always be on top of their
toes,” said Hilario Deleon, chairman of the Milwaukee County Republican
Party. “If it’s successful, the city is successful.”</p>

id="google-can-totally-explain-why-chromium-browsers-quietly-tell-only-its-websites-about-your-cpu-gpu-usage">Google
can totally explain why Chromium browsers quietly tell only its websites
about your CPU, GPU usage</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s time for Google being Google, this time by using an undocumented
APIs to track resource usage when using Chrome. When visiting a
*.google.com domain, the Google site can use the API to query the
real-time CPU, GPU, and memory usage of your browser, as well as info
about the processor you’re using, so that whatever service is being
provided – such as video-conferencing with Google Meet – could, for
instance, be optimized and tweaked so that it doesn’t overly tax your
computer. The functionality is implemented as an API provided by an
extension baked into Chromium – the browser brains primarily developed
by Google and used in Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave, and others. ↫ Brandon
Vigliarolo at The Register The original goal of the API was to give
Google’s various video chat services – I’ve lost count – the ability to
optimise themselves based on the available system resources. Crucially,
though, this API is only available to Google’s domains, and other,
competing services cannot make use of it. This is in clear violation of
the European Union’s Digital Markets Act, and with Chrome being by far
the most popular browser in the world, and thus a clear gatekeeper, the
European Commission really should have something to say about this. For
its part, Google told The Register it claims to comply with the DMA, so
we might see a change to this API soon. Aside from optimising video chat
performance, the API, which is baked into a non-removable extension,
also tracks performance issues and crashes and reports these back to
Google. This second use, too, is at its core not a bad thing –
especially if users are given the option to opt out of such crash
analytics. Still, it seems odd to use an undocumented API for something
like this, but I’m not a developer so what do I know. Mind you, other
Chromium-based browsers also report this data back to Google, which is
wild when you think about it. Normally I would suggest people switch to
Firefox, but I’ve got some choice words for Firefox and Mozilla, too,
later today.</p>

pictures, bootable floppy disks, and the first Canon Cat demo?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>About a month ago, Cameron Kaiser first introduced us to the Canon
Cat, a computer designed by Jeff Raskin, but abandoned within six months
by Canon, who had no idea what to do with it. In his second article on
the Cat, Kaiser dives much deeper into the software and operating system
of the Cat, even going so far as to become the first person to write
software for it. One of the most surprising aspects of the Cat is that
it’s collaborative; other users can call into your Cat using a landline
and edit the same document you’re working on remotely. Selecting text
has other functions too. When I say everything goes in the workspace, I
do mean everything. The Cat is designed to be collabourative: you can
hook up your Cat to a phone line, or at least you could when landlines
were more ubiquitous, and someone could call in and literally type into
your document remotely. If you dialed up a service, you would type into
the document and mark and send text to the remote system, and the remote
system’s response would also become part of your document. (That goes
for the RS-232 port as well, by the way. In fact, we’ll deliberately
exploit this capability for the projects in this article.) ↫ Cameron
Kaiser You can also do calculations right into the text, going so far as
allowing the user to define variables and reuse those variables
throughout the text to perform various equations and other mathematic
operations. If you go back and change the value of a variable, all other
equations using those variables are updated as well. That’s quite nifty,
especially considering the age of the Cat, and since the Cat is fixed
width, you can effectively create spreadsheets this way, too. There’s
really far too much to cover here, and I strongly suggest you head on
over and read the entire thing.</p>

<strong>Stop using ease-out, or ease-in-out, or whatever-out, in every
UI animation!</strong>
</p>
<p>
There is a lot of propaganda on the internet against ease-in, saying
that it’s “unnatural”, “unusual”, or that it’s “of the devil”. Some say
that it’s both “sluggish” and “abrupt”. Many pointing to ease-out as the
safe, smooth, satisfying messiah of animation (including its safer kin,
ease-in-out). There are even published ‘best practices’ which can be
summed up to
<a target="_blank" href="https://web.dev/articles/the-basics-of-easing">“just
use ease-out”</a>. This post is here to set things straight — in a
nonlinear fashion.
</p>
<p>
So, why not ease-out? And what to use instead?
</p>
<h2 id="reason-1-its-overused">
Reason #1. It’s overused
</h2>
<p>
Let’s get the weakest point out of the way. Ease out is boring because
it’s everywhere. Because it’s part of the browser default
<code>ease</code> function (which is a combination of a fast ease-in
with a slow ease-out).
</p>
<p>
It’s like how corners are getting rounder and rounder on the web simply
because it’s easy and built-in.

<p>
Is the public missing out on better web animations (and better corners)
because of the ubiquity of these practices? Yes.

<h2 id="reason-2-its-unrealistic">

<p>
How about a study in skeuomorphism?

Imagine a mechanical toggle switch. Something like the following video:

<strong>The toggle switch’s position curve follows the ease-in
curve!</strong> A slow start, gradually building up momentum, then
finally stopping to a satisfying ‘click’!
</p>
<p>
Contrary to “best practice”, the natural motion of a toggle switch does
not follow an ease-out nor an ease-in-out curve! I’ll go further and say
that ease-out is unnatural for any kind of UI control that represents a
tactile interaction.
</p>
<p>
Like buttons. In the real world, buttons (the ones that are nice to
press anyway) have some kind of buckling mechanism when pressed. Similar
to the toggle switch example above, there’s a buildup, a fall, and a
final ‘click’ into place.

<span>A button. In the real world.</span>
<p>
Best practice says that the sharp stop is unnatural and should be
avoided. But that well-defined resolution is part of what makes switches
and buttons feel good. Just imagine a button that dampens the motion the
more you press it. It’ll feel squishy and mushy. You know what else
slows down the further you go? Ease-out!
</p>
<p>
And yet, thousands of UIs still use ease out for UI controls!

Of course, not all UI animations need ease in, such as macro

that ‘animate themselves’ as opposed to raw manipulation.

Unlike switches and buttons, these things don’t have a frame or housing
that can immediately stop them when they ‘bottom out’. So they have to
decelerate naturally.
</p>
<p>
In the end, it depends. But as a general rule? Ease-in for tactile
things.

<p>
This theory was introduced by a psychologist named Daniel E. Berlyne in
1970. The idea is that an increase in tension followed by a sharp
decrease produces a satisfying feeling. This framework works well for
ease-in’s case in the context of the force curve, or more directly, with
ease-in’s initial slow buildup followed by its abrupt resolution.

If you’re looking for the psychology behind microinteractions, well,
that’s one of them.

<span>The three-act structure with a tension graph.</span>
<p>
In storytelling or filmmaking, the
<a target="_blank" href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeActStructure">three-act
structure</a> is a model for analysing or creating good stories. It
mirrors the tension-resolution sequence in a grander scale. And with
bigger scope comes the potential for a higher level of satisfaction —
<em>catharsis</em>. Great stories that use the three-act structure
always leave you in a state of catharsis.
</p>
<p>
Is it possible to have micro-catharses in UI animations?
</p>
<hr>
<p>
All of these patterns of satisfaction reflect ease-in’s slow buildup and
sudden resolution. While there are other kinds of satisfying phenomenon,
like <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/3clqk2U3T9Y">sand
slicing</a> which has nothing to do with any of this; tension and
release is a way to induce the positive effect.
</p>
<p>
There must be a balance to the proportion of tension and release, else
the negative effects of the tension may overcome the positive effects of
release, or the tension too light that the release is too shallow. A
bubble wrap that is really hard to pop would be quite annoying, and a
grand story that ends prematurely would be disappointing. The easing
curve must be manually finetuned depending on the purpose. For buttons
and toggles, keep it shorter than a bubble wrap pop.

it? If so, you just made an ease-in motion.

<h2 id="tips">
Tips
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Use a custom curve appropriate to the size of the element. Don’t use the
default ease-in because it’s likely to feel too slow for most use cases.
In CSS, there’s
<a target="_blank" href="https://cubic-bezier.com/"><code>cubic-bezier()</code></a>
for example.
</li>
<li>
Use a duration appropriate to the curve, the size of the element, and
the scale of the movement.
</li>
<li>
Partially start the animation on pointer press, not on release.
<ul>
<li>
For mouse users, there’s already an initial ‘actuation force’ required
to trigger the mouse button. In these cases, the initial velocity
shouldn’t be zero (the easing curve shouldn’t start at a horizontal
slope). For touchscreens, there’s no such actuation force.
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>
<h2 id="conclusion">
Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
Don’t use ease-out in everything! Try ease-in! Or try a combination of
both with varying weights! Just try anything at all. Tweak your curves
as often as you tweak your paddings.
