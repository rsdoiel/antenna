## Netanyahu Rival Visits US, Signals Wider Cracks in Israel’s Wartime Leadership

date: 2024-03-04, from: VOA News USA

Tel Aviv, Israel — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rebuked a top Cabinet minister arriving in Washington on Sunday for talks with U.S. officials, according to an Israeli official, signaling widening cracks within the country’s leadership nearly five months into its war with Hamas.


The trip by Benny Gantz, a centrist political rival who joined Netanyahu’s wartime Cabinet following Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, comes as friction between the U.S. and Netanyahu is rising over how to alleviate the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza and what the postwar plan for the enclave should look like.


An official from Netanyahu’s far-right Likud party said Gantz’s trip was planned without authorization from the Israeli leader. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Netanyahu had a “tough talk” with Gantz and told him the country has “just one prime minister.”


Gantz is scheduled to meet Monday with U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Tuesday with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, according to his National Unity Party. A second Israeli official speaking on the condition of anonymity said Gantz's visit is intended to strengthen ties with the U.S., bolster support for Israel’s war and push for the release of Israeli hostages.


In Egypt, talks were underway to broker a cease-fire before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins next week.


Israel did not send a delegation because it is waiting for answers from Hamas on two questions, according to a third Israeli government official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Israeli media reported that the government is waiting to learn which hostages are alive and how many Palestinian prisoners Hamas seeks in exchange for each.


All three Israeli officials spoke anonymously because they weren’t authorized to discuss the disputes with the media.


The U.S. began airdrops of aid into Gaza on Saturday, after dozens of Palestinians rushing to grab food from an Israel-organized convoy were killed last week. The airdrops circumvented an aid delivery system hobbled by Israeli restrictions, logistical issues and fighting in Gaza. Aid officials say airdrops are far less effective than deliveries by truck.


U.S. priorities in the region have increasingly been hampered by Netanyahu’s Cabinet, which is dominated by ultranationalists. Gantz’s more moderate party at times acts as a counterweight.


Netanyahu's popularity has dropped since the war broke out, according to most opinion polls. Many Israelis hold him responsible for failing to stop the Oct. 7 cross-border terror attack by Hamas, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took roughly 250 people as hostages into Gaza, including women, children and older adults, according to Israeli authorities.


More than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began, around two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and fighters. Around 80% of the population of 2.3 million have fled their homes, and U.N. agencies say hundreds of thousands are on the brink of famine.


Israelis critical of Netanyahu say his decision-making has been tainted by political considerations, a charge he denies. The criticism is particularly focused on plans for postwar Gaza. Netanyahu wants Israel to maintain open-ended security control over Gaza, with Palestinians running civilian affairs.


The U.S. wants to see progress on the creation of a Palestinian state, envisioning a revamped Palestinian leadership running Gaza with an eye toward eventual statehood.


That vision is opposed by Netanyahu and the hard-liners in his government. Another top Cabinet official from Gantz's party has questioned the handling of the war and the strategy for freeing the hostages.


Netanyahu's government, Israel's most conservative and religious ever, has also been rattled by a court-ordered deadline for a new bill to broaden military enlistment of ultra-Orthodox Jews. Many of them are exempt from military service so they can pursue religious studies. Hundreds of Israeli soldiers have been killed since Oct. 7, and the military is looking to fill its ranks.


Gantz has remained vague about his view of Palestinian statehood. Polls show he would earn enough support to become prime minister if a vote were held today.

A visit to the U.S., if met with progress on the hostage front, could further boost Gantz’s support.


Israel and Hamas are negotiating over a possible new cease-fire and hostage release deal. Vice President Harris said Sunday it is now up to Hamas to agree to it. “Given the immense scale of suffering in Gaza, there must be an immediate cease-fire for at least the next six weeks, which is what is currently on the table,” Harris said.


Israelis, deeply traumatized by Hamas’ attack, have broadly backed the war effort as an act of self-defense, even as global opposition to the fighting has increased.


But a growing number are expressing their dismay with Netanyahu. Some 10,000 people protested late Saturday to call for early elections, according to Israeli media. Such protests have grown in recent weeks but remain much smaller than last year's demonstrations against the government's judicial overhaul plan.


If the political rifts grow and Gantz quits the government, the floodgates will open to broader protests by a public that was already unhappy with the government when Hamas struck, said Reuven Hazan, a professor of political science at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.


At least 12 people were killed, including five women and two children, in an Israeli strike Sunday that hit a house in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, according to an Associated Press journalist at Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah. And two Israeli strikes southwest of Deir al-Balah killed at least five people and destroyed an aid truck, according to witnesses and staff at the hospital.


Amid concerns about the wider regional conflict, White House senior adviser Amos Hochstein was going to Lebanon on Monday to meet officials, according to an administration official who was not authorized to comment. White House officials want Lebanese and Israeli officials to prevent tensions along their border from worsening.

## Congressional Leaders Come Out With 6 Spending Bills in Drive to Avoid Partial Shutdown

date: 2024-03-04, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Congressional leaders on Sunday came out with a package of six bills setting full-year spending levels for some federal agencies, a step forward in a long overdue funding process beset by sharp political divisions between the two parties as well as infighting among House Republicans.


The release of the text of legislation over the weekend was designed to meet the House's rule to give lawmakers at least 72 hours to study a bill before voting. And it's a promising sign that lawmakers will avoid a partial shutdown that would kick in at 12:01 a.m. Saturday for those agencies covered under the bill, such as Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Transportation, Justice and others.


Congressional leaders hope to complete votes on the package this week and continue negotiations on the remaining six annual spending bills to pass them before a March 22 deadline. The price tag for the package out Sunday comes to about $460 billion, representing less than 30% of the discretionary spending Congress looks to approve for this year. The package still being negotiated includes defense spending.


House Speaker Mike Johnson highlighted some key policy and spending wins for conservatives, even as many of his Republican colleagues consider the changes inadequate. Some House Republicans had hoped the prospect of a shutdown could leverage more concessions from Democrats.


Overall, this year's spending bills would keep non-defense spending relatively flat with last year's bill, despite the rise in inflation, and some $70 billion less than what President Joe Biden originally sought.


"House Republicans secured key conservative policy victories, rejected left-wing proposals, and imposed sharp cuts to agencies and programs critical to President Biden's agenda," Johnson said in a prepared statement.


Earlier this year, Johnson and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced an agreement on the top-line spending levels for this year's discretionary spending, which comes to more than $1.6 trillion. But that agreement didn't address potential policy mandates placed within the bills. That's where negotiations have focused in recent weeks.


Democrats staved off most of the policy riders that House Republicans sought to include. For example, they beat back an effort to reverse the FDA's decision that allows the abortion pill mifepristone to be sold in retail pharmacies, instead of only in hospitals, clinics and medical offices. Democrats also said the bill would fully fund a nutrition program for low-income women, infants and children known as WIC, providing about $7 billion for the program, a $1 billion increase from the previous year.


"Throughout the negotiations, Democrats fought hard to protect against cuts to housing and nutrition programs and keep out harmful provisions that would further restrict access to women's health or roll back the progress we've made to fight climate change," Schumer, said in support of the legislation.


House Republicans were able to achieve some policy wins, however. One provision, for example, will prevent the sale of oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to China.


Another provision strengthens gun rights for certain veterans. Under current law, the VA must send a beneficiary's name to the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System whenever a fiduciary is appointed to help manage someone's benefits. This year's spending package prohibits the VA from transmitting that information unless a relevant judicial authority rules that the beneficiary is a danger to himself or herself, or others.


Still, some of the more conservative members of the House Republicans have been critical of the spending bills, and many voted against the short-term extension Congress passed last week that avoided a shutdown and allowed negotiations to continue.


"We all promised we wouldn't do this crap when we got up here," Rep. Eric Burlison, a Republican, said as the short-term extension was debated. "The American people have demanded responsible spending and border security for years, but we fail them. When will we heed the calls of our constituents to rein in the wasteful spending, secure the borders, and defeat the bureaucracy targeting them?"


The short-term extension last week was the fourth in recent months. The vote to approve it was 320-99, but House Republicans were divided, with 113 in support and 97 against. The Senate approved the extension, 77-13.


The votes being teed up on spending bills come five months after the budget year began.

## Hundreds of inmates flee after armed gangs storm Haiti’s main prison, leaving bodies behind

date: 2024-03-03, from: San Jose Mercury News

Hundreds of inmates have fled Haiti&#8217;s main prison after armed gangs stormed the facility overnight in an overnight explosion of violence that engulfed much of the capital. At least five people are dead. The jailbreak marks a new low in Haiti&#8217;s downward spiral of violence. It comes as gangs assert greater control in the capital, Port-au-Prince, while Prime Minister Ariel Henry is abroad trying to salvage support for a United Nations-backed security force. Authorities have yet to provide an account of what happened. The leader of a nonprofit that works in the prison says fewer than 100 of the nearly 4,000 inmates remain behind bars. Family members have rushed to check on loved ones.

## Supermium: up-to-date Chromium for Windows XP, Vista, and 7

date: 2024-03-03, from: OS News

Modern browsers don&#8217;t really support older versions of Windows anymore, so anyone running Windows XP, 2003, Vista, and even Windows 7 and 8 are losing access to secure and capable browsers. While running those older versions of Windows on production machines isn&#8217;t exactly advised, they&#8217;re still great fun as retrocomputing platforms and to keep older Windows games accessible using period-correct hardware. As such, there&#8217;s some awesome news: there is now a fully up-to-date variant of Chromium for these older versions of Windows called Supermium. It tracks current Chromium, supports extensions, sandboxing, Aero Glass, Google Sync, and even Widevine on Windows 7 and higher. Micheal MJD just published a video showing Supermium in action in case you&#8217;re curious. You&#8217;ll need at least Windows XP SP3 and an Intel Pentium 4 with SSE2 in order to run it, and Windows 2000 support is in the works, too.

## Supreme Court Decision Expected Soon in Colorado’s Trump 2024 Ballot Case

date: 2024-03-03, from: VOA News USA

Washington — A Supreme Court decision could come as soon as Monday in the case about whether former President Donald Trump can be kicked off the ballot over his efforts to undo his defeat in the 2020 election.


Trump is challenging a groundbreaking decision by the Colorado Supreme Court that said he is disqualified from being president again and ineligible for the state's primary, which is Tuesday.


The resolution of the case Monday, a day before Super Tuesday contests in 16 states, would remove uncertainty about whether votes for Trump, the leading Republican candidate for president, will ultimately count. Both sides had requested fast work by the court, which heard arguments less than a month ago, on Feb. 8,


The Colorado court was the first to invoke a post-Civil War constitutional provision aimed at preventing those who "engaged in insurrection" from holding office. Trump also has since been barred from primary ballot in Illinois and Maine, though both decisions, along with Colorado's, are on hold pending the outcome of the Supreme Court case.


The Supreme Court has until now never ruled on the provision, Section 3 of the 14th amendment.


The court indicated Sunday there will be at least one case decided Monday, adhering to its custom of not saying which one. But it also departed from its usual practice in some respects, heightening the expectation that it's the Trump ballot case that will be handed down.


Except for when the end of the term nears in late June, the court almost always issues decisions on days when the justices are scheduled to take the bench. But the next scheduled court day isn't until March 15. And apart from during the coronavirus pandemic when the court was closed, the justices almost always read summaries of their opinions in the courtroom. They won't be there Monday.


Any opinions will post on the court's website beginning just after 10 a.m. EST Monday.


Separately, the justices last week agreed to hear arguments in late April over whether Trump can be criminally prosecuted on election interference charges, including his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The court's decision to step into the politically charged case, also with little in the way of precedent to guide it, calls into question whether Trump will stand trial before the November election.


The former president faces 91 criminal charges in four prosecutions. Of those, the only one with a trial date that seems poised to hold is his state case in New York, where he's charged with falsifying business records in connection with hush money payments to a porn actor. That case is set for trial on March 25, and the judge has signaled his determination to press ahead.

## Vice President Harris Leads Bloody Sunday March, Says Fight for Voting Rights Goes On

date: 2024-03-03, from: VOA News USA

SELMA, Alabama — Vice President Kamala Harris told thousands gathered for the 59th anniversary of the Bloody Sunday attacks on civil rights marchers in Selma, Alabama, that fundamental freedoms, including the right to vote, are under attack in America even today.


Harris joined those gathered at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where voting rights activists were beaten back by law enforcement officers in 1965. The vice president praised the marchers' bravery for engaging in a defining moment of the civil rights struggle.


"Today, we know our fight for freedom is not over, because in this moment we are witnessing a full on attack on hard-fought, hard-won freedoms, starting with the freedom that unlocks all others, the freedom to vote," Harris said.


She criticized attempts to restrict voting, including limits on absentee voting and early voting, and said the nation is again at a crossroad.


"What kind of country do we want to live in? Do we want to live in a country of freedom, liberty and justice? Or a country of injustice, hate and fear?" Harris asked, encouraging people to answer with their vote.


She paid tribute to the civil rights marchers who walked across the bridge in 1965 knowing they would face certain violence in seeking "a future that was more equal, more just and more free."


Decisions by the Supreme Court and lower courts since 2006 have weakened the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which was passed in the wake of the police attacks in Selma. The demonstrators were beaten by officers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge on March 7, 1965, as they tried to march across Alabama to support voting rights.


Harris drew parallels between those who worked to stifle the Civil Rights Movement and "extremists" she said are trying to enact restrictions on voting, education and reproductive care.


She said other fundamental freedoms under attack include "the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body," a reference to state abortion bans. She also stressed the Biden administration's support for a six-week ceasefire in Gaza to "get the hostages out and a significant amount of aid in."


Under a blazing blue sky, Harris then led the crowd across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in the march that concludes the annual commemoration. Thousands followed, sometimes singing hymns and anthems of the Civil Rights Movement including, "Ain't Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me 'Round."


Earlier Sunday, Attorney General Merrick Garland spoke at a Selma church service marking the anniversary of the attack by Alabama law officers on civil rights demonstrators. He said recent court decisions and certain state legislation have endangered voting rights in much of the nation.


"Since those (court) decisions, there has been a dramatic increase in legislative measures that make it harder for millions of eligible voters to vote and to elect representatives of their choice," Garland told worshippers at Selma's Tabernacle Baptist Church, the site of one of the first mass meetings of the voting rights movement.


"Those measures include practices and procedures that make voting more difficult; redistricting maps that disadvantage minorities; and changes in voting administration that diminish the authority of locally elected or nonpartisan election administrators," he said. "Such measures threaten the foundation of our system of government."


The march and Garland's speech were among dozens of events during the Selma Bridge Crossing Jubilee, which began Thursday and culminated Sunday.


The commemoration is a frequent stop for Democratic politicians paying homage to the voting rights movement. Some in the crowd gathered to see Harris speak about the upcoming November election and what appears to be a looming rematch between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.


Khadidah Stone, 27, part of a crowd gathered at the bridge Sunday in light rain before the march, said she sees the work of today's activists as an extension of those who were attacked in Selma in 1965. Stone works for the voter engagement group Alabama Forward and was a plaintiff in the Voting Rights case against the state that led to creating a second Alabama congressional district with a substantial number of Black voters. Voters will cast their first ballots in that district on Tuesday.


"We have to continue to fight, because they (voting rights) are under attack," Stone said.


Nita Hill wore a hat saying "Good Trouble," a phrase associated with the late Rep. John Lewis, who was beaten on the bridge during Bloody Sunday. Hill, 70, said it is important for Biden supporters to vote in November.


"I believe Trump is trying to take us back," said Hill, a retired university payroll specialist.


Decades ago, images of the violence that at the bridge stunned Americans, which helped galvanize support for passing the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The law struck down barriers prohibiting Black people from voting.


U.S. Rep. James Clyburn, a Democrat of South Carolina who is leading a pilgrimage to Selma, said he is seeking to "remind people that we are celebrating an event that started this country on a better road toward a more perfect union," but the right to vote is still not guaranteed.


Clyburn sees Selma as the nexus of the 1960s movement for voting rights, at a time when there currently are efforts to scale back those rights.


"The Voting Rights Act of 1965 became a reality in August of 1965 because of what happened on March 7th of 1965," Clyburn said.


"We are at an inflection point in this country," he added. "And hopefully this year's march will allow people to take stock of where we are."

## Voucher expansion leads to more students, waitlists and classes for some religious schools

date: 2024-03-03, from: San Jose Mercury News

The Miami Archdiocese’s superintendent of schools says Catholic education is increasingly in demand in South Florida, now that all K-12 students regardless of income are allowed to use taxpayer-funded programs to pay for private school tuition.

I&#8217;m going to leave the title off this post and see what happens. Titles are a lot of pressure! I think there is a reason that the big text-based social networking sites (Mastodon, X, Facebook, Threads, LinkedIn, Bluesky, etc.) don&#8217;t have titles. Especially for short posts, the title just isn&#8217;t necessary. Just say the thing. [&#8230;]

## Biden <i>is</i> a fine president

date: 2024-03-03, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I found myself responding at length to my longtime friend and proto-blogger <a href="https://www.threads.net/@jeffjarvis/post/C4Dyym1uc3c">Jeff Jarvis</a>, so instead of posting a thread of chained messages, I just made it a blog post. </p>
<p>The thing about Gaza is that there's the rest of the world, and they're watching to see how we deal with Israel, given that Netanyahu has been such an asshole to the US. He's a freaking MAGA. </p>
<p>So the president has to gradually increase the pressure on Israel, but he has to be mindful that there already is a shitload of pressure all around, more pressure is the last thing we need. A lot more people will die if it spirals out of control. But Biden is increasing the pressure. The images of the air food drops into Gaza from US planes is exactly the right way to proceed for the US. It shows that there's another path, compassion and help. </p>
<p>Being president of the United States is a complicated thing IOW. But they're doing it the only way we can, given who we are.  </p>
<p>Jeff, I know you know this. This would be the adult discussion, which we never have. Journos seem to think Americans can't understand the basics of world politics, but somehow we understand the rules and history of the NBA, NFL and MLB. The functioning of politics isn't really any more complicated. </p>

## Pluralistic: The Cory Doctorow Humble Bundle (03 Mar 2024)

date: 2024-03-03, from: Cory Doctorow's blog

Today's links The Cory Doctorow Humble Bundle: Name your price, get ebooks, back EFF! Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Podcasts, events and more. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. The Cory Doctorow Humble Bundle (permalink) It's been 21 years and 29 days since Tor Books published my first novel, Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom. In the years since, Tor has published every one of my novels, sending me around the USA and Canada to talk about them. Now, they've teamed up with Humble Bundle to sell 18 of my ebooks on a name-your-price basis, with part of the proceeds going to benefit EFF: https://www.humblebundle.com/books/cory-doctorow-novel-collection-tor-books-books I've been associated with EFF even longer than I've been published by Tor! My first novel came out while I was working EFF's first-ever booth at CES. I split my time between the booth and my motel room, where I paid $0.25/call to dial up to Earthlink's local number and manage the launch-day publicity. Over the years, I've benefited immensely from Tor's editorial and publicity departments, working with brilliant publishing people like Patrick Nielsen Hayden, Patty Garcia, Dot Lin, Laura Etzkorn, Elena Stokes, Sarah Reidy, Lucille Rettino, and of course, Tor founder Tom Doherty. But I like to think that it was a two-way street. Tor and I have come a long way together on ebooks: most visibly, they allowed me to publish several novels under Creative Commons licenses (my first book was the first ever CC book, coming out just weeks after the licenses themselves launched). As my editor Patrick Nielsen Hayden said at the time, "Ebooks have the worst hours-in-meeting-to-dollars-in-revenue ratio of anything in my publishing career. Why not?" https://craphound.com/down/download/ Just as important &#8211; but less visible &#8211; was Tor's willingness to let me insist that all my books be published without DRM, meaning that anything you buy on say, Amazon, can be moved to any reader program if you decide to start getting your ebooks elsewhere. This worked so well that in 2012, Tor became the first major publisher in the world to ban DRM on all its ebooks, flying me, John Scalzi and Charlie Stross to New York City to announce it this at a big, splashy event at Book Expo America: https://web.archive.org/web/20130512022634/https://tor.com/blogs/2012/06/tor-books-announces-e-book-store-doctorow-scalzi-a-stross-talk-drm-free Tor's unique status as the sole major DRM-free publisher in the world was well timed! That same year, I curated the very first Humble Ebook Bundle, which was very top-heavy with Tor titles, and raised more than $1,000,000 for the writers, publishers and charities associated with it: https://web.archive.org/web/20121017215636/http://www.humblebundle.com/ That opened the floodgates to a series of Humble Bundles, tempting other major publishers to dabble with DRM-free, including Simon and Schuster: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-I5QyAfglU And Harpercollins: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHMLfeCrCrE Now, 12 years after that inaugural Humble Ebook Bundle, I find myself honored by being the subject of a bundle of my own (it helps that I've written a hell of a lot of books in the intervening years). Included in the bundle are (nearly) all of my Tor novels and novellas: The Lost Cause; "The Canadian Miracle" (a Lost Cause story); Red Team Blues; Radicalized; Walkaway; "Party Discipline" (a Walkaway story); Pirate Cinema; Rapture of the Nerds (with Charlie Stross); For The Win; Makers; Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town; Eastern Standard Tribe, Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom, Little Brother, Homeland, Attack Surface, and "Lawful Interception" (a Little Brother story). (The sole exclusion is The Bezzle, which came out two weeks ago and is already a USA Today national bestseller!) https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865878/thebezzle Also included in the bundle is Poesy the Monster Slayer, my 2020 picture book for the littlies: https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781626723627/poesythemonsterslayer All these books are delivered as DRM-free epub files. The Bundle runs for the next three weeks, and the minimum buy-in is $18 &#8211; that's just $1/book (full retail value is $187). Of course, you can name a higher price, and, as with all Humble Bundles, you can adjust the final split to share out the money between me, EFF, and the Humble folks.

There&#39;s a rule in covering elections that they don&#39;t make projections or even analyze results on TV until all the polls are closed. We need an analogous rule that says there should be no reporting on polls until after the election, to allow the people to form their own opinions, for the same reason.

## Should court storming by fans in college basketball be banned?

date: 2024-03-03, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>When Wake Forest University&#8217;s Demon Deacons defeated Duke University&#8217;s Blue Devils on Saturday, Wake Forest students stormed the court, celebrating their team&#8217;s victory over a much-maligned in-state rival. Duke player Kyle Filipowski got injured during the exuberant on-court celebration and chaos, which prompted calls to end court storming, with an eye on protecting the players.</p>

## More delays? Supreme Court was wrong to put off Trump immunity decision

date: 2024-03-03, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>The Supreme Court announced on Wednesday that it will consider Donald Trump&#8217;s claim that as a former president he enjoys immunity from prosecution for alleged crimes connected to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. By taking the case and scheduling oral argument for the week of April 22, the court has further complicated the timeline for a Trump trial, which a district judge originally scheduled for March 4.</p>

## MIA: An Alternate Strategy for Gaza

date: 2024-03-03, updated: 2024-03-03, from: RAND blog

The international community cannot dictate a solution to Israel-Hamas war by fiat. If the international community wants Israel to change strategies in Gaza, then it should offer a viable alternative strategy to Israel's announced goal of destroying Hamas in the strip. And right now, that alternate strategy simply does not exist.

## IndieWeb Carnival: Roundup

date: 2024-03-03, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>February has come to an end and with it also ended my experience hosting the 9th edition of the IndieWeb Carnival. To be honest with you, I didn’t know what to expect going into this. Foreverliketh.is—who was the host for the month of January—emailed me one day asking me if I wanted to host one of the upcoming months because the carnival was running short on hosts and I obviously accepted.</p>
<p>His month on the topic of <a href="https://foreverliketh.is/blog/indieweb-carnival-january-2024-positive-internalization/">Positive Internalization </a> saw <a href="https://foreverliketh.is/blog/indieweb-carnival-january-2024-positive-internalization/">13 people contributing</a> and so I said to myself “If 10 to 15 people decide to participate in February I’ll consider that a win”.</p>
<p>Well, looks like we got there. I have 44 links in front of me so this is going to be quite the roundup but before we jump into that let me first say thank you to all the people who decided to take the time to participate. You’re all a bunch of awesome people. Also, the Carnival continues and this month’s topic is going to be <a href="https://blog.basementcommunity.com/accessibility-in-the-personal-web/">Accessibility in the Small Web</a>. Look forward to reading your posts there. Now it’s time to dive into the submissions.</p>
<h2>Quick overview</h2>
<p>As I said before, I have 44 links in front of me. One person contributed 2 posts, 43 of those posts were written specifically for this month’s carnival and 1 was submitted not by its author but by someone else. They thought it was a quality entry and they were right so I decided to include it.</p>
<h2>The roundup</h2>
<p>It’s 7.42 am, I have my cup of tea in front of me, and it’s time to review all these entries.</p>
<h3>On Digital Relationships: Once Upon A Time, I Was A Voxer</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://bix.blog/2024/02/01/on-digital-relationships-once-upon-a-time-i-was-a-voxer/">Bix Frankonis</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s no way for me to write up my time as a Voxer both online and off in any way that’s comprehensive or even likely especially coherent. Between the memory deficiencies and the flood of alcohol with occasional marijuana digressions, there’s just not enough to form a full picture. While I appear on the incest map, there are versions that link me to people with whom I did not have a saliva or semen connection. The community was a jumbled mess but there’s also a lot of myth wrapped up in it all. I won’t deny I at least had more than my fair share of crushes, including a photographer who I didn’t actually know very well, although we got along fine, and whose later and far too soon funeral to this day I regret missing. (People still remember you, K.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love that this was the first post I received. I am a sucker for stories. I just love them. I love learning about people’s previous lives, about their adventures, about the way they got where they are now. I also love when the physical and the digital intersect and learning about the origin of the name Bix was such a treat.</p>
<h3>Digital relationships</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://vhbelvadi.com/digital-relationships">Venkatram Harish Belvadi</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Understanding that the generalisability of any study can be questioned, it is worth reflecting that the IndieWeb—made up in large part of text-heavy websites—can help foster meaningful digital relationships, strengthen social support and feelings of satisfaction associated with these relationships. And because a key, if indirect, result of the IndieWeb movement is to promote a balance of creation and consumption, it is all the more powerful a tool to employ in strengthening digital relationships of humans through the web.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>VH post was the starting point for so many interesting deep dives and I’m going to write at least a few posts thanks to this. I loved the parallelism between the IndieWeb and the physical interactions.</p>
<h3>On digital relationships: I miss my gaming buddies</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://jsrn.net/2024/02/02/digital-relationships-i-miss-my-gaming-buddies.html">James</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Looking back, all this happened in a flash. At the time, it felt like aeons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I loved this entry focused on gaming because I personally have so many great memories that are related to that. The hours spent with three weirdos—you know who you are—playing co-op games on the PS4 during the pandemic days will stay with me forever. So many laughs, and so many great moments.</p>
<h3>Digital Relationships</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://longest.voyage/log/digital-relationships/">Jamie Crisman</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re still dating. I mean… I married her, but we still date too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jamie’s post made me smile because it’s such a lovely story. One I can relate to all too well. I might tell my story at some point. Maybe.</p>
<h3>The four phases</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://werd.io/2024/the-four-phases">Ben Werdmuller</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the first era, technology was here to catalogue us.<br />
In the second, it was here to empower us.<br />
In the third, it was here to observe us.<br />
In the fourth, it is here to replace us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m wondering what the fifth phase is going to look like. This is the type of post I love to read. Full of interesting information and thought-provoking.</p>
<h3>Digital Relationships</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://carlbarenbrug.com/digital-relationships">Carl Barenbrug</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's a struggle to slow the cadence of the web and our daily social interactions; to avoid becoming over-stimulated the second we wake up in the morning. And it's for this reason I find myself gravitating towards natural activities of the past—without a screen. Albeit with a slightly different landscape and a more focused mindset.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is something I’m also experiencing. And it’s paradoxical in a way. I retreated from social media years ago to hide in my digital corner and do my own things. I spend more time outside, walking, enjoying nature, and listening to birds. And yet what’s left of my online life is a lot more meaningful.</p>
<h3>Digital Relationships</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://tangiblelife.net/digital-relationships">Steve Ledlow</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>How a family sits around a table in public all staring at their phones carrying on relationships digitally with everyone other than those sitting in close physical proximity is a tip of the societal scale that disturbs me. How others begin, navigate and end romantic relationships exclusively with digital mechanics confuses me. The fact that our world seems to be trending toward more technology that replaces the relationship with more digital depresses me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The large-scale implications of technology are something that worries me a lot. It’s one of those topics I find myself returning over and over again. Another topic I need to explore more on this site.</p>
<h3>The Technology Mediated Relationships</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://sarajaksa.eu/2024/02/indieweb-carnival-february-2024-the-technology-mediated-relationships/">Sara Jakša</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And people are trying to solve this for themselves. Which is why there are so many different online spaces and different ways of communication online. But that also means, that there is no way to have one way to communicate with everybody.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I couldn’t help to ask myself if that’s necessarily a bad thing. Do we actually need a way to communicate with everybody? Maybe we want some friction in the system. Maybe the fact that not everyone is willing to use emails is why emails are still the best way to have one-to-one interactions online.</p>
<h3>Oh the People You'll Meet: A Visual Timeline of Human Connections</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://andzuck.com/blog/connections-over-time/">Andrew Zuckerman</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s not bad to know many people. The value of a substantial social network is quite high. But having just one close person to go to when you’re feeling down… how many average relationships is that worth? Who feels deep happiness for you when something good happens in your life? Who can you make beautiful memories with?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I couldn’t agree more. Like everything in life, what matters is to find a good balance. You want plenty of interactions to keep your mind stimulated and your points of view challenged and the digital world is perfect for that. But you also want at least a couple of close IRL relationships.</p>
<h3>People &amp; Content #5: Networking</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://garden.mattstein.com/notes/people-content-5-networking">Matt Stein</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My favorite of these networked-but-not-online spectacles were the LAN parties we’d have in high school.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>LAN PARTIES! Those were dope. I still remember playing UT99 with a bunch of people at an improvised LAN party in a garden. And there was pizza. UT99 and pizza. What more can you ask from life? I should probably look into setting up a server to play UT99 with people. Could be fun.</p>
<h3>Digital Relationships Offer Real Hope</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://bjhess.com/posts/digital-relationships-offer-real-hope">Barry Hess</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I try to imagine what my life would look like if I was stuck with only the relationships geographically close to me. I have those relationships as well, and I treasure them, but they simply cannot offer the diversity of thought, background, and experience that digital relationships allow. I’m so incredibly thankful to live in an era where I can have the best of both worlds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The global nature of the web is an underappreciated quality. Like, can we just stop for a second and appreciate the fact that I’m typing this while sitting in Italy and you’re reading this somewhere else on the globe? It’s fucking amazing.</p>
<hr />
<p>9.12 am: time for a break. Can’t believe I’m only a quarter of the way through this roundup post.</p>
<hr />
<p>9.37 am: I’m back!</p>
<h3>On Influencers and Parasocial Relationships</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://devastatia.com/on-influencers-and-parasocial-relationships">Devastatia del Gato</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>So yeah The early Internet gave us opportunities for interpersonal relationships. The modern Internet gives us parasocial relationships.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love Devastatia’s website. It’s absolutely everything mine isn’t and I love that. I also loved her post because it touches on another topic I plan to write about at some point. Parasocial relationships are fascinating and disturbing.</p>
<h3>A Kafkaesque digital relationship with ourselves</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/kafkaesque-digital-relationship-with-ourselves/">Simone Silvestroni</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Leaving the corporate web is not enough. Refusing to follow influencers with their incessant broadcasting of self-promotion is not enough. Repopulate an RSS reader with brilliant blogs from newfound like-minded people is not enough. Homepages dressed as business cards are everywhere, convinced as we are that presenting ourselves as a product is the only way to go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/controversial-opinion-two">wrote about personal branding back in 2017</a> and my opinion on the topic hasn’t changed. Reading Simone’s post made me want to rewrite my About page though.</p>
<h3>The evolution of online BFFs</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://chronosaur.us/2024/02/09/the-evolution-of-online-bffs/">Karen</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some of my good friends I still haven’t met! We only communicate online in assorted ways. We text, we send each other memes and voice messages and emails. I count them as some of my very best friends and they have been there for me in some of my darkest moments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is one of those things that people can’t fully understand until they try for themselves. It’s incredible how much you can connect with others via the digital space.</p>
<h3>Anonymous, asynchronous friendships</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://hamatti.org/posts/anonymous-asynchronous-friendships/">Juha-Matti Santala</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Others, I’ve gotten to know in real life. And it’s a wonderful sensation when you meet someone for the first time in a pub and the usual “getting to know a stranger” feeling isn’t there at all. We would continue the discussions we’ve had for years without a hitch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It really is incredible how normal it feels when you finally meet someone in person. Probably 2 hours after having met Rob in person we were wandering the woods chasing howls as if that’s the most normal thing to do with someone you only just met. But it was perfectly normal because we were friends. And we still are.</p>
<h3>Far but close</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://www.michalzelazny.com/far-but-close/">Michal Zelazny</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But it all starts on the internet, on the old independent web, where there’s no algorithm and no digital gods telling us what we can and can’t see. It all starts there but it all continues somewhere else. It continues in our hearts. Because it doesn’t matter what channel or app we use to communicate, as long as we have the will. Because whatever app we use, a friend will be on the other side. We can enjoy whatever platform we have while it exists, and we can move on when it ceases to exist. It doesn’t matter if the platform stays or not, what matters is that friends will be there, friends will stay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love this. And I love mail! I keep thinking that maybe I should set up a PO Box and start connecting at an even slower pace. Maybe after I moved and I finally have a home I’m gonna do just that.</p>
<h3>One Degree of Kevin Bacon - Digital Relationships in the 21st Century</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://andrei.xyz/post/one-degree-of-kevin-bacon/">Andrei</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even if these persons are remote, they still mean the world to us, we still care about them, we love them and they are our friends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is another aspect I love about true relationships. They flow. They change, they evolve, they move from digital to physical but they still mean something, no matter the circumstances.</p>
<h3>Zero Degrees of Kevin Bacon - Digital Relationships Addendum</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://andrei.xyz/post/zero-degrees-of-kevin-bacon/">Andrei</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the end, looking back at all the time we spent, I realized I just enjoyed your company, but I actually never knew you at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you for writing this Andrei. It felt oddly therapeutic reading this story.</p>
<h3>On digital relationship</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://mattiacompagnucci.com/on-digital-relationship">Mattia Compagnucci</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Belonging and connecting are battles between in-person and screen time. I struggle to balance digital and in-person interaction; as I push myself to live in the present, connecting with someone digitally lets me sometimes feel I’m not since I’m somewhere else with my mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is something we as a society have to confront at some point. Especially with younger generations growing up so connected. The struggle is real and it is a struggle. And we have to do something about it.</p>
<h3>A neighborhood blog</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://poview.org/posts/a-neighborhood-blog/">Yaidel</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a neighborhood everyone knows who is the fool, who is the one who talks a lot, who is the one who always tells lies, the honest one, the teacher, the doctor, the veterinarian, the one who steals, etc. But not on the Internet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is why I try to be as honest with myself as possible on my site. I don’t try to perform, don’t try to create a persona. I try to be who I am, following my interests, and not trying to be distracted by anything else.</p>
<h3>I ♥︎ Plain Digital Text</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://aleemshaun.com/i-heart-plain-digital-text/">Aleem Shaun</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a world bombarded by advertising, algorithms and apps that encourage us to scroll forever, plain text reminds me there’s more to life than the trappings of digital excess.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m with you. I fucking love plain text. I’m writing this post in markdown, my to-do lists are just markdown. Text is powerful. </p>
<h3>Writing As a Relationship</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://skyhold.org/words/writing.html">C Jackdaw</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe that co-writing is an excellent practice for long-term relationship partners. It can keep things fresh and exciting, allowing you to literally fall in love all over again with someone you've been married to for ten years. More than once I've seen something we're writing reflect back to me something I've been thinking about but not been able to solve on my own; solving the problem on the page is a relief.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was such a fascinating read into something I never even thought it was a thing that people do. And this is why I love the web. It allows me to discover all sorts of interesting things.</p>
<hr />
<p>10.42 am: Halfway through the list. Can I just say that I loved going through the posts a second time? You’re all so nice and cool and interesting. What an enjoyable experience this is.</p>
<h3>Communicating online and building relationships</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2024/02/21/communicating-online-and-building-relationships/">Horst Gutmann</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>While lots of people seem to be able to build connections through large chats, for me forums just allowed me think a bit more about what the person I was talking to actually meant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I still think forums are underappreciated and I also still think I should set up one at some point. Also, thank you for sharing that bash.org exchange because it was hilarious.</p>
<h3>Digital excuses</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://umerez.eu/2024/02/24/digital-excuses.html">Esteban Umerez</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m not going to apologize, though, because this is my indie blog and my indie post and my indie state of mind. I’m a boomer, but I intend to take full advantage of the modern whining trend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You do you sir! Jokes aside, tech is a blessing and a curse. Especially when it becomes unmanageable. And sometimes I think the only solution to tech problems is more tech. Which is silly but it’s a silly world the one we live in.</p>
<h3>A Love Letter to my Laptop</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://westleywinks.com/writing/a-love-letter-to-my-laptop/">Westley Winks</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I’m writing this, I can’t help but think maybe this relationship is strange. Maybe I have too much dependence on my devices and that I shouldn’t rely on technology so much. I shouldn’t be so materialistic or be so attached. But when you spend that much time during some of your most profound years with any one thing, living or otherwise, it is bound to become sentimental.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s odd how we can feel an attachment to objects but it’s something I can absolutely relate to. I don’t own many things but there are a bunch I care about and I’d feel really sad if I were to lose them. Also, this post made me want to go back to working on a laptop, something I’m missing these days.</p>
<h3>Digital tools may create life long relationships</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://www.antonsten.com/writing/digital-tools-may-create-life-long-relationships">Anton Sten</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think people are keen on comparing digital relations to physical relations, but I don’t think they are easily comparable. They are the same, but different.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think sometimes we lack words to describe these things. I keep saying things like “Digital” or “IRL” but those don’t fully capture the spirit of the things I’m trying to communicate. We need a better vocabulary for the digital world.</p>
<hr />
<p>11.12 am: life is calling, have to stop now. But don’t worry, I’ll be back.</p>
<hr />
<p>8.51 am: it’s a new day, time to finish writing this roundup.</p>
<h3>Digital Relationships; or, How I Met My Wife and Why I Might Not Try That Again</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://starbreaker.org/blog/digital-relationships-february-2024/index.html">Matthew Graybosch</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am careful to remember that you too are just a voice in the dark. We have never spoken. We have never shared a meal together. We have never shaken hands or embraced. We have never stood side by side against a common enemy with our actual and only lives at stake. As tempting as it is to forget the body when online, we are not daemons or spirits without bodies. We are human beings, embodied and earthbound, and any bonds we forge should take that into account.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love Matthew’s post. As I said to him, his story reminds me of mine in a way. Again, maybe I’ll write about it one day.</p>
<h3>Digital relationships with our past</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://www.archaeoramblings.com/blog/digital-relationships-with-our-past/">Andrea Titolo</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The unguided nature of the app allows people to reflect on these experiences, instead of providing them with a ready-made interpretation or a written text to read or skip. Left alone, immersed in these soundscapes, we are forced to reflect on our emotions triggered by sound and visual elements, thus building a unique relationship with the past and with the archaeological site.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I very much enjoyed this entry because it tackles a completely different type of digital relationship, one I never spent time thinking about. I’m now so intrigued by the concept of digital archeology.</p>
<h3>On digital relationship</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://bacardi55.io/2024/02/26/on-digital-relationship-feb-2024-indieweb-carnival/">Bacardi55</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people think it is impossible to have meaningful exchanges / relationships with other without seeing each other, but I disagree. It is even sometime better to talk to people you don’t see, some topics are easier that way. Yes written communication are more complex because some information can not be shared (body language, tone - in particular irony and sarcasm, …), but that doesn’t prevent people to find a way to interact that works for them and create true companionship, friendship or more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that sometimes not having access to non-verbal communication can be a good thing. You’re forced to focus on the actual message because that’s all you have.</p>
<h3>Stories of digital relationships</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://42m.me/digital-relationships/">Mick</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And none of this would’ve ever happened, if I hadn’t trusted that the “virtual” people beyond the screen can be even realer than the “real” ones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trusting the people on the other side of the screen can be challenging. Because, sadly, the web—and the world in general—is full of dickheads. But I can tell you from experience that it’s also full of kind people.</p>
<h3>Digital Relationship Reminiscenc</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://trivial.observer/blog/2024/02/20240227/">Basil</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All good things come to an end. People moved on as the platform struggled with some technology changes and my online life once again reverted to the mainstream social networks, meaning news consumption on Twitter and sharing posts with real world contacts via Facebook and WhatsApp.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is one of the sad truths about the web in general and why I also think personal sites are the best way to stay online: platforms come and go. The only place you can count on still being there in 10 or 15 years is the one you control.</p>
<h3>Digital relationships</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://lars-christian.com/digital-relationships/">Lars-Christian</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rules of engagement changed. Where our digital playgrounds once were about hanging out and shooting the shit with friends, they now became something else. People started optimising. Optimising what? Everything. What they said, how they said it and when they said it. All in an effort to gain more friends. We still called them friends at that point. But the veil quickly fell away and the term followers eventually took the place of friends. And rightly so, because you can’t optimise for friendship. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that people managed to build careers out of being active on social platforms is one of the big tragedies of the modern web.</p>
<h3>Websites as a catalyst for personal relationships</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://holzer.online/articles/2024/02/29/index.html">Fabian Holzer</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the dominating platforms of today, nobody will ever be a citizen, not even a customer. We're only good enough to be a user. But outside of the walled gardens, there are still ample opportunities. We can form relationships, participate in debate, cultivate a corner of and shape the digital medium. All these verbs - nota bene - have in common that they are active.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s why I always encourage people to write publicly but to also email others and create connections. The open web requires effort but it will also reward you for doing so.</p>
<h3>The Downside of Digital Relationships</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://chavanniclass.wordpress.com/2024/02/28/digital-relationships/">Ratika Deshpande</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The internet may connect us to the whole world, but I think that the convenience is making us disconnect from each other in the offline world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Digital relationships can be a trap and it’s absolutely vital to have a good balance. Like almost everything in life, we need balance. And it’s important to always keep that in mind.</p>
<h3>Seven Year Itch</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/seven-year-itch">Jeremy Cherfas</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the end, that's the beauty of digital relationships. You can borrow someone's partner without harming their relationship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was such a hilarious way to close a post. </p>
<h3>Crying Out</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://blogelogeluren.netlify.app/posts/crying-out/">Turpelurpeluren</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I am slowly coming to realize is that there is a mismatch in pace between my conceptions of real life vs. internet. Everything online seems to be moving at incredible speeds</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s one of the reasons why spending more and more time cultivating my online corner. The web is just too vast and moves at such a stupid speed that you end up always feeling left behind.</p>
<h3>The Internet's Tower of Babel</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://niqwithq.com/posts/the-internets-tower-of-babel">Niq Bernadowitsch</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the early days of the internet, these protocols were established. Email or the web itself were created upon open protocols for everyone to make use of. A shared language on the internet was born.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s amazing that the fundamentals of the web are still there, still allowing us to run our websites and still allowing us to interact via email.</p>
<h3>Software Is Built Online</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://www.ciccarello.me/blog/2024/02/29/software-online/">Anthony Ciccarello</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is wild to me, is how many of these projects are managed on a volunteer basis. While some people are fortunate to be paid to work on open source software, most projects are primarily one person spending their free evenings trying to understand the questions people submit and make the project better for everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s incredible how much of the web is the result of a relatively small number of people spending their free time working on projects for the simple fact that they care about this platform.</p>
<h3>Virtual Intimacy and Emotional Bonds</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/indieweb-carnival-february-2024-digital-relationships">Pablo Morales</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of us desire a form of intimacy and emotional bond from those important to us. Oftentimes the only way to get these is through a virtual medium. We want to foster deep emotional connections with the absence of physical proximity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ability to connect through distance is one of technology's best qualities. And it was painfully obvious during the COVID days.</p>
<h3>Rebuilding Digital Relationships</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://alabut.com/writing/digitalrelationships/">Al Abut</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, it’s like a good chunk of the world took an intensive course on online communication in the last 4+ years and decided that well what do you know? Those geeks were on to something.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Funny how things change. It’s also interesting how remote work can open the doors to a lot more possibilities in life. You no longer have to live in the same place—or close—where your workplace is.</p>
<h3>Digital Relationships</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://microbyte.neocities.org/posts/digitalrelationships">Microbyte</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>on large social media, everything is drowned out, compacted, an endless stream, which, even without technical limits causes more compactness, which causes more abstractions. Meanwhile, forums tend to lend themselves to more long-form communications. And to compound on that previous point, on social media a true conversation is nearly impossible, always getting drowned out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s why I left social media long ago. I found it more performative than social.</p>
<h3>The Neon God</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://foreverliketh.is/blog/the-neon-god/">Foreverliketh.is</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We converse as phantoms, the diluted remnants of intimacy’s essence, and yet still, somehow, retain the gall to call that a “relationship”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was such a wild read but it reminded me the time I decided to watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Experiments_Lain">Serial Experiments Lain</a> back in the early 2000s. I Should probably rewatch that anime.</p>
<h3>digital life</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://jessdriscoll.com/digital-life/">Jess Driscoll</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wish you were closer. But I’m glad that we’re here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is how I feel about the majority of my online interactions. Sometimes I wish I was closer to those people but at the same time I’m glad I have the opportunity to interact with them,</p>
<h3>Email Is a Good Fence</h3>
<p>By <a href="https://www.justuseemail.com/email-is-a-good-fence/">Lawrence</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fence of email offers the perfect hedge between peace and a nearly frictionless, noisy, text messaging environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was submitted by Nutchanon Wetchasit and the post was not written for the Carnival but I loved the fence metaphor and that’s why I decided to include it. And you also might not be surprised to know that I agree with the content of the post. Because you all know that I love emails.</p>
<hr />
<p>10.34 am: we got to the end! Thank you all again for taking the time to write and submit content for the Carnival. Running it was a blast and I loved reading all your entries. I look forward to reading your entries for this <a href="https://blog.basementcommunity.com/accessibility-in-the-personal-web/">month’s carnival</a>!</p>

## Climate Change Costs US Ski Industry Billions, Study Says

date: 2024-03-03, from: VOA News USA

DENVER, Colorado — U.S. ski areas lost $5 billion from 2000 to 2019 as a result of human-caused climate change and could lose around $1 billion annually in the 2050s depending on how much emissions are reduced, a new study found.


People "may not care about the loss of the species halfway around the world, or a flood that's happening in some other part of the world. But sport is often something people care about," said Daniel Scott, a scientist at the University of Waterloo and study co-author. "And they can see some of these changes happening."


Warm weather has upended winter recreation across North America and Europe this year, canceling a 402-kilometer dog sled race in Maine, opening golf courses in Minnesota, and requiring snow saved from the previous year to run a ski race in Austria. A warm, dry El Niño weather pattern coupled with global warming is to blame, scientists say, and has put the threat to winter on center stage.


"It's a now problem, not a future-looking problem," said Auden Schendler, senior vice-president of sustainability at Aspen One, a ski and hospitality company that helped fund the study, published in Current Issues in Tourism.


It models what average ski seasons would have looked like from 2000 to 2019 in the four major U.S. markets — the Northeast, Midwest, Rocky Mountain and Pacific West — without climate change. Its baseline comparison is ski seasons from 1960 to 1979 — a period when most ski areas were operating and before significant trends of human-caused warming began. It found the average modeled season between 2000 and 2019 was shorter by 5.5 to 7.1 days, even with snowmaking to make up for less natural snow.




Under an optimistic emissions reduction scenario, the future of the U.S. ski industry would see seasons shortened by 14 to 33 days in the 2050s, even with snowmaking. A high-emissions scenario would nearly double the days lost.


Countries meeting for annual climate talks agreed in December that the world needs to be "transitioning away" from the fossil fuels that are heating the planet to dangerous levels, but set no concrete targets for doing so. Earth last year had its hottest year on record, and monthly records have continued this year.


"The future of the ski industry, if that's something you care about, is really in our hands and it will play out over the next 10 to 15 years in terms of the policies and actions that we take to reduce emissions," Scott said.


The researchers calculated economic losses based on increased operating costs for snowmaking along with lost skier revenue. Scott called the estimates "probably somewhat conservative," noting that they don't include such things as the loss of money that skiers spend on goods and services in winter sport communities.


The researchers said they undertook the study in part to fill a void in good data about how much climate change was costing the ski industry. They also suggested such data would be needed if the industry pursued lawsuits against fossil fuel producers, citing as a precedent ongoing litigation by several Colorado communities that are suing oil companies ExxonMobil and Suncor Energy for the cost of adapting to the impacts of climate change.


The researchers wrote that snowmaking is "no longer able to completely offset ongoing climate changes" and said "the era of peak ski seasons has likely passed in most U.S. markets."


David Robinson, a Rutgers University researcher and the New Jersey state climatologist, made the same point as he called the study interesting and solid.


"It's not going to stop snowing," said Robinson, who wasn't involved in the work. But "things such as snowmaking are only going to be able to go so far where it's being done now" as the planet continues to warm.


Julienne Stroeve, a senior scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center, who also wasn't involved in the work, said the study doesn't address how skiers and snowboarders might respond to declining quality of the snow that does fall. She wondered whether skier behavior will change if poor snow conditions become more frequent.


That change in skier behavior is known as substitutability, Scott said. If skiing isn't an option or doesn't provide good snow conditions, will people travel to another ski area? Turn to mountain biking? Scott said he would like to find out.


"That's another one of those things we'd love to know more about, because then you could improve the modeling," he said.

## Climate Change, Cost and Competition for Water Drive Tribal Settlement

date: 2024-03-03, from: VOA News USA

FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. — A Native American tribe with one of the largest outstanding claims to water in the Colorado River basin is closing in on a settlement with more than a dozen parties, putting it on a path to piping water to tens of thousands of tribal members in Arizona who still live without it.


Negotiating terms outlined late Wednesday include water rights not only for the Navajo Nation but the neighboring Hopi and San Juan Southern Paiute tribes in the northeastern corner of the state. The water would come from a mix of sources: the Colorado River that serves seven western states, the Little Colorado River, and aquifers and washes on tribal lands.


The agreement is decades in the making and would allow the tribes to avoid further litigation and court proceedings, which have been costly. Navajo officials said they expect to finalize the terms in the coming days.


From there, it must be approved by the tribe's governing bodies, the state of Arizona, the other parties and by Congress.


“We have the right Congress, we have the right president, and it's very hopeful,” Navajo President Buu Nygren told The Associated Press on Wednesday. “Because next year might be a whole different ballgame. It's going to be very uncertain.”


The proposal comes as Native American tribes, states in the Colorado River basin and Mexico are working on a long-term plan to share a diminishing water source that has served 40 million people. Tribes, including the Navajo Nation, were left out of a landmark 1922 treaty that divided the water in the basin among seven states.




The Navajo Nation has long argued that states treat the tribe as an afterthought. Any settlement reached would be separate from that long-term plan and stand on its own.


About one-third of the homes on the Navajo Nation do not have running water. Infrastructure projects outlined by the Navajo Nation include a $1.7 billion pipeline to deliver water from Lake Powell to tribal communities. The caveat being that there is no guarantee that Congress will provide the funding.




Both the Navajo and Hopi tribes are seeking the ability to lease water and to store it in existing or new reservoirs and impoundments.


“Some of our families that still live within those communities still have to haul water to cook their food, to make lemonade in the summer for their kids, to make ice, all little simple things to make your daily life easy and convenient," Navajo Nation Council Speaker Crystalyne Curley said.


On Wednesday, the Navajo Nation cited climate change, cost, competition for water and the coronavirus pandemic as reasons to move toward a settlement. Arizona, in turn, would benefit by having certainty over the amount of water that is available to non-tribal users. The state has had to cut its use of Colorado River water in recent years because of drought and demand.


Tom Buschatzke, director of the Arizona Department of Water Resources, said Wednesday that while progress is being made on a settlement with the Navajo Nation, the agreement isn't complete.


Sarah Langley, a spokeswoman for Flagstaff, the largest city that is a party to the settlement, said it is hopeful the negotiations are productive.


Arizona — situated in the Colorado River's Lower Basin with California, Nevada and Mexico — is unique in that it also has an allocation in the Upper Basin. Under the settlement terms, Navajo and Hopi would get about 47,000 acre-feet in the Upper Basin — nearly the entire amount that was set aside for use at the Navajo Generating Station, a coal-fired power plant on the Navajo reservation that shut down in late 2019.




The proposal also includes about 9,500 acre-feet per year of lower-priority water from the Lower Basin for both tribes. An acre-foot of water is roughly enough to serve two to three U.S. households annually.  


While the specific terms for the San Juan Southern Paiute Tribe remain under discussion, Congress could be asked to establish a small reservation for the tribe whose ancestral land lies in Utah and Arizona. The tribe's president, Robbin Preston Jr., didn't immediately respond to emailed questions from the AP.


The Hopi Tribe's general counsel, Fred Lomayesva, declined to comment.  


The Navajo Nation, whose 27,000 square-mile (70,000 square-kilometer) reservation also stretches into New Mexico and Utah, already has settled its claims to the Colorado River basin there.


The Navajo and Hopi tribes came close to reaching a pact with Arizona to settle water rights in 2012. Both tribes rejected federal legislation that accompanied it, and the tentative deal fell through. It also wasn't broadly supported by Navajos and Hopis who saw negotiations as secretive, leading to a loose effort to recall then-Navajo President Ben Shelly and then-Hopi Chairman LeRoy Shingoitewa.  


Recently, the Navajo Nation Water Rights Commission has been holding public hearings across the reservation to ensure tribal members are aware of what is involved in a settlement and why the tribe pursued it, tribal officials said.


“We have a united front to our chapters, our schools and even our small businesses, families," Curley said. “It's inclusive of everyone. Everybody should be able to know what the terms are.” 


The federal government in recent years has poured money into tribal water rights settlements. The U.S. Supreme Court also ruled the government does not have a treaty duty to take affirmative steps to secure water for the Navajo Nation, complicating the tribe's fight for water.

## Blizzard Closes Roads, Ski Resorts in Sierra Nevadas

date: 2024-03-03, from: VOA News USA

TRUCKEE, California — A powerful blizzard that a meteorologist termed "as bad as it gets" howled in the Sierra Nevada mountains, closing a long stretch of Interstate 80 in Northern California, forcing ski resorts to shut down, and leaving thousands of homes without power.


More than 3 meters of snow was expected at higher elevations, National Weather Service meteorologist William Churchill said Saturday, creating a "life-threatening concern" for residents near Lake Tahoe and blocking travel on the key east-west freeway.


"It's a blizzard," said Dubravka Tomasin, a resident of Truckee, California, for more than a decade. "It's pretty harrowing."


Kyle Frankland, a veteran snow-plow driver, said several parts of his rig broke as he cleared wet snow underneath piles of powder.


"I've been in Truckee 44 years. This is a pretty good storm," Frankland said. "It's not record-breaking by any means, but it's a good storm."


Churchill said snow totals by late Sunday would range from 1.5 to 3.6 meters, with the highest accumulations at elevations above 1,500 meters. Lower elevations were inundated with heavy rain.


He called the storm an "extreme blizzard for the Sierra Nevada, in particular, as well as other portions of Nevada and even extending into Utah and portions of western Colorado." But he said he didn't expect records to be broken.


"It's certainly just about as bad as it gets in terms of the snow totals and the winds," Churchill said. "It doesn't get much worse than that."


A second, weaker storm was forecast to bring an additional .3 to .6 meters of snow in the region between Monday and Wednesday next week, according to the National Weather Service office in Sacramento.


Near Lake Tahoe, Thomas Petkanas, a bartender at Alibi Ale Works in Incline Village, Nevada, said about 1 meter of snow had fallen by midday Saturday. He said patrons shook off snow as they arrived at the brewpub and restaurant.


"It's snowing pretty hard out there, really windy, and power is out to about half the town," Petkanas said by telephone. "We're one of the few spots open today."




Adele Attix said her husband spent the morning clearing their driveway while she worried about whether she would be able to open her consignment clothing store in Truckee. She said Saturdays are usually the busiest day of the week.


"I'd say more than anything, just knowing if we're going to open or not has probably caused the most amount of stress," Attix said. "I figured I'd come down here and check out the shop."


Earlier, the weather service warned that blowing snow was creating "extremely dangerous to impossible" driving conditions, with wind gusts in the high mountains at more than 160 kph.


Avalanche danger was "high to extreme" in backcountry areas through Sunday evening throughout the central Sierra and greater Lake Tahoe area, the weather service said.


California authorities on Friday shut down 160 kilometers of I-80, the main route between Reno and Sacramento, because of "spin outs, high winds, and low visibility." There was no estimate when the freeway would reopen from the California-Nevada border west of Reno to near Emigrant Gap, California.


Travel was treacherous east of the Sierra, where CalTrans also cited "multiple spin outs and collisions" and "whiteout conditions," as it closed 145 kilometers of U.S. 395 from near Bishop in the Owens Valley to Bridgeport, north of Mono Lake.


Pacific Gas & Electric reported about 7,468 California homes and businesses without power at 5:56 p.m. NV Energy reported power outages for about 1,500 customers in parts of northern Nevada, including Incline Village and Reno.


In southern Nevada the weather service issued a warning Saturday for high winds gusting to 145 kph. NV Energy reported almost 29,000 customers without power in and around Las Vegas on Saturday, but by that evening the number had been reduced to about 16,000.


A tornado Friday afternoon in Madera County, California, damaged an elementary school, said Andy Bollenbacher, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Hanford.


Some ski resorts shut down Friday and were digging out Saturday with an eye toward reopening Sunday.


Palisades Tahoe, the largest resort on the north end of Tahoe and site of the 1960 Winter Olympics, closed all chairlifts Saturday because of snow, wind and low visibility.


Other areas closed Saturday included Sugar Bowl, Boreal and Sierra. Heavenly Mountain Resort planned to open late with limited operations.


The storm began barreling into the region Thursday. A blizzard warning through Sunday morning covers a 480-kilometer stretch of the mountains.


Some ski lovers raced up to the mountains ahead of the storm.


Daniel Lavely, an avid skier who works at a Reno-area home/construction supply store, was not one of them. He said Friday that he wouldn't have considered making the hour-drive to ski on his season pass at a Tahoe resort because of the gale-force winds.


But most of his customers Friday seemed to think the storm wouldn't be as bad as predicted, he said.


"I had one person ask me for a shovel," Lavely said. "Nobody asked me about a snowblower, which we sold out the last storm about two weeks ago."


Meteorologists predicted as much as 3 meters of snow was possible in the mountains around Lake Tahoe by the weekend, with 0.9 to 1.8 meters in the communities on the lake's shores and more than 30 centimeters possible in the valleys on the Sierra's eastern front, including Reno.


Yosemite National Park closed Friday. Officials said it would remain closed through at least noon Sunday.

## March 2, 2024

date: 2024-03-03, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

On February 25, 1901, financier J. P. Morgan&#8217;s men filed the paperwork to incorporate a new iron and steel trust, and over the weekend, businessmen waited to see what was coming. Five days later, on March 2, the announcement came: J. P. Morgan was overseeing the combination of companies that produced two thirds of the nation&#8217;s steel into the United States Steel Corporation. It was capitalized at $1.4 billion, which at the time was almost three times more than the federal government&#8217;s annual budget.

The big deal with ChatGPT is that it's a huge improvement over search. Instead of hunting for clues to the info you need, you can ask the question you have and get an answer. It has encyclopedic knowledge of all the development environments I use. And it knows how to put the pieces together. I don't care how it does it, it's a much higher level tool than search. Like the difference between a calculator and a computer.

A few months ago I introduced you to one of the more notable Apple pre-production units in my collection, <a href="/2023/06/new-ram-card-prototype-mac-portable.html">a late prototype Macintosh Portable</a>. But it turns out it's not merely notable for what it is than what it has on it: a beta version of System 6.0.6 (the doomed release that Apple pulled due to bugs), Apple sales databases, two online services &mdash; the maligned Mac <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodigy_%28online_service%29">Prodigy</a> client, along with classic AppleLink as used by Apple staff &mdash; and two presentations, one on Apple's current Macintosh line and one on the upcoming System 7. Now that I've got the infamous Conner hard drive it came with safely copied over, it's time to explore its contents some more.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEitMPsOX_6ygMIT0rwXlp1obnIOpqMOCMdtZAZTjgCvcuHBswcXbPce1vizDNTiTrrvIRmMqNQMCt1SJqqFfW10n_enq3TsDx3qF8mqQOofy0yTiNoSPFVijVIrJ_k7MECodWdZJ9hZ2PPm_zslc673g1GfstZGT9oPTukBpICzBSRR8swOIos4LUUftJA/s511/037.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="342" data-original-width="511" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEitMPsOX_6ygMIT0rwXlp1obnIOpqMOCMdtZAZTjgCvcuHBswcXbPce1vizDNTiTrrvIRmMqNQMCt1SJqqFfW10n_enq3TsDx3qF8mqQOofy0yTiNoSPFVijVIrJ_k7MECodWdZJ9hZ2PPm_zslc673g1GfstZGT9oPTukBpICzBSRR8swOIos4LUUftJA/s320/037.png"/></a></div>

We'll start with this Macintosh Portable itself and Apple's sales channel applications, moving from there to a brief presentation of Apple's Macintosh product line as Apple's own marketing staff would have presented it, at a distinct point in the company's history.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhvO5adw1GLQJCBfY9ETmCMPfCd4MXxdBg2Cb4jiLnza6eenBAop77BBhf88DA2QWliBZrdRNeZpG9KXJ4JVlQHtG_FktlDGLhsFg9HohHKneE2j4hNri9SNI-Sl-moPvMp36WC8tpJlLQMdq5nIoV5WrdEd4W5XClpEtsHmUau4iWeomJ5Z-0YqH2-z90/s640/004.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="480" data-original-width="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhvO5adw1GLQJCBfY9ETmCMPfCd4MXxdBg2Cb4jiLnza6eenBAop77BBhf88DA2QWliBZrdRNeZpG9KXJ4JVlQHtG_FktlDGLhsFg9HohHKneE2j4hNri9SNI-Sl-moPvMp36WC8tpJlLQMdq5nIoV5WrdEd4W5XClpEtsHmUau4iWeomJ5Z-0YqH2-z90/s320/004.png"/></a></div>

After that, we'll also look at the upcoming System 7.0 circa 1989-90 and a couple very different views of the operating system during its alpha phase.

Finally, after a brief glance at Mac Prodigy, we'll explore a little taste of AppleLink in its classic incarnation on General Electric's Mark III network &mdash; and spoof it enough to actually get it to log in.

This unit lacks U.S. Federal Communications Commission clearance, complete with a warning applique that says "ATTENTION! This unit is a demonstration unit only. It is not for sale or resale. Production units will comply with all applicable Federal Rules and Regulations." That last sentence would imply it isn't a production unit, meaning it's not at PVT stage, but it is clearly more developed than an EVT prototype would be. Since FCC certification usually occurs after hardware development is complete but before mass production begins, this makes it most likely a DVT unit. The only thing that doesn't work properly on this machine is the audio, which even after capacitor replacement remained unusually quiet, though I don't recall that it ever worked during its time in my possession.
<p>
I know of a couple other Macintosh Portable prototypes out there in collector's hands, though if you've got a Mac Portable yourself of any age, they all hail from that unpleasant turn-of-the-decade era where virtually all period Apple hardware will require new capacitors (everything in this one has been completely replaced). The Portable was not officially released until September 1989 simultaneously with the Macintosh IIci, where the base 1MB/floppy configuration started at $5799, or $6499 with one of those loathsome Conner hard disks (approximately $14,400 and $16,150 respectively in 2024 dollars). That puts this serial-less unit's manufacture likely somewhere around spring '89.
<p>
In architectural terms Apple described the Portable as an evolved Macintosh SE. Though high performance and with some innovative features, the Portable's biggest drawbacks &mdash; literally &mdash; were its size and its heavy lead-acid battery, and it sold barely a fifth of what it was expected to. Apple cancelled it in October 1991.

Naturally, being a pre-production prototype it's also not a backlit model &mdash; that of course came later &mdash; but the 640x400 screen remains excellent, an early example of an active matrix LCD that Apple boasted had an individual transistor for every pixel and one of the best displays on any portable machine from the period. (Sometime in the near future I'll dig out my Data General One, a fine example of the <em>opposite</em> extreme.) It has an Androda 7MB expansion card <a href="/2023/06/new-ram-card-prototype-mac-portable.html">to give it 8MB of RAM</a>, just shy of the 9MB maximum it was capable of addressing, though no card sold for the Portable back in the day could achieve this and even the 9MB RAM cap is problematic. This is possibly due to the lowest motherboard 1MB being shared between ROM and RAM (ROM overlays it at reset to allow the machine to start even with RAM in a non-deterministic state), as well as at least one ROM bug that makes heavily expanded units sluggish when exiting sleep. On the Portable, which is all about being able to sleep on demand, the phenomenon becomes most obnoxious with "large" amounts of RAM like this.

We'll switch at this point to screengrabs instead of photos. Neither are ideal for our purposes, but although the Portable does have an external video-out port, that port don't hunt. Despite being a DE-15 VGA-style connector instead of the expected classic Mac DA-15, you'll actually damage it plugging in a VGA display; the lines it exposes are more or less the same as the LCD drive lines and require conversion. No presentation module came with this unit and despite Apple's promises and various rumours, there is no clear evidence any such adapter was ever produced for sale by anyone. We can't get every snapshot since the old Shift-Command-3 salute only runs when apps yield to the system, but it's better than trying to hover over the screen with my Pixel 7 Pro. (System 6 takes screenshots in MacPaint 576x720 format, which I have obviously reformatted and rotated.)

The specific version of classic Mac OS this machine is running is also unusual: it's a beta 12 release of System 6.0.6 (with a beta 6.1.6 Finder), which came out simultaneously with 6.0.5 in March 1990 for early Macintosh Classic, IIsi and LC machines, but was pulled from release and replaced with 6.0.7 in September. The problems were discovered so late in production that it even forced Apple to yank and reissue the system disk packs shipped with the computers, slapping "6.0.7" stickers on the label.
<p>
6.0.6 had two major problems, one where AppleTalk was sometimes not detected when present due to a bug in <tt>Gestalt</tt>, causing connectivity issues with servers and printers, and another with timing problems between the LC and IIsi and the ADB Apple Keyboard II, where the keyboard would intermittently freeze up until the mouse was moved. However, neither of those problems have manifested on this Portable so far, and 6.0.6 additionally fixed issues with the Portable's modem and reading 800K floppy disks, so you really should run at least 6.0.7 or 6.0.8 (it originally shipped with 6.0.4, also the same as the IIci).

The machine was clearly used for both business and pleasure, at least through 1991 which was the latest file I could cursorily find. A fair bit is personal and not generally interesting (and as such I've redacted or put off-screen a few things in these grabs), but it's proof it clearly got substantial use, and why not? Slung on a desk, it was a perfectly cromulent Macintosh with a 16MHz 68000, double that of the Plus, with a big sharp screen, a high quality keyboard and a nice trackball. You definitely wouldn't be using it on your lap, but you could certainly lug it to and from work.
<p>
That said, I'm not exactly certain where "work" in fact was located. Interestingly, one application on the hard disk suggests <em>Cleveland, Ohio</em>, of all places,

... but this might just be who held the site license, and when we get to AppleLink there's good evidence that the unit spent most of its time in Silicon Valley. I know the prior user was an Apple district manager from other credentials on the disk and a little bit of Googling. For obvious reasons I won't show those.

A related point is its network configuration: the Macintosh network volume mounted in these shots is my little NetBSD Macintosh IIci (for moving the grabs off), but it doesn't seem like it was ever connected to a network before because the username was originally blank in the Chooser. After all, it would be odd that other personal stuff and credentials weren't removed while the AppleTalk username specifically had been, so more likely it was never populated in the first place.
<p>
Other relics persist on the hard disk. For example, the HyperCard stacks introducing users to the Macintosh Portable are also still here, though they seem to be slightly earlier versions than what got shipped with production models and have different wording, and the Tour of the Macintosh Portable app isn't present. This unit may have predated it.

I picked two grabs out of it for example's sake, including the active matrix display (again, as you saw, it's really good especially for 1989) and its CMOS 68HC000 CPU, which was designed by Hitachi and introduced jointly with Motorola in 1985. Besides reducing power consumption from 1.35W down to about 300mW, it ran at 16MHz in the Portable compared to its usual Mac speed of around 8MHz (and the part could run as high as 20MHz). Despite the Portable's substantial development delays it was nevertheless one of the earliest computers to use it, along with the original PowerBook 100 which in nearly every respect is a miniaturized Portable.

There were a lot of products advertised. Spoiler alert: the Portable's underwhelming market performance mostly sealed their fates.

For example, this (and a similar image in the <i>Inside</i> stack) are the only pictures I could find of the video adapter. I don't know if this is a mockup or a prototype. There are a couple switches along with a Mac DA-15 monitor jack and an RCA jack, presumably for composite output. This device doesn't seem related at all to the separate and duly sold Apple Presentation System which was made by Focus and rebadged by Apple.

One other gotcha with the Portable, besides the weight, the huge lead acid battery wired in series and (nowadays) the capacitor issue, was its prodigious need for sleep. If you check the box to <i>Stay awake when plugged in</i> ...

That said, it's the work stuff that we're here for. This machine unsurprisingly has a full complement of office applications, including Aldus PageMaker and Aldus Persuasion (pre-Adobe), MacWrite II, MacDraw, HyperCard, and early versions of Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Works.

But what also caught my eye going through the applications folder was a suite named POS&bull;IM. The name alone implies this is a point-of-sale system, divided into applications for accounts receivable, inventory and sales. I won't show any real customer records here and I don't know how widely deployed this was within the Apple sales channel at that time, but it probably wouldn't have been installed at all if there weren't some expectation it would be used.

The apps were produced by a Utah company called AnaMatrix. I can't find much information on this company and the suite appears to have been its only product. In <i>MacUser</i> February 1990, it listed for $2500 single-user and $4000 multiuser (in 2024 about $5800 and $9300 respectively), though it was called "POS/IM" with a slash instead of the interpunct. This installation is the single-user standalone release, starting here with the accounts receivable application.

We'll use this record "Bill Jones" since it's almost certainly an example (for one thing, that street address doesn't exist in the real Riverton, UT, and the zip code 87444 isn't currently valid). Each record tied back to an invoice.

This is what I suspect is the phony entry, for an XL Apple T-shirt in blue, made by "Ned the Knitter" and sold for $17.95. The reason I suspect this is a demo row is because this exact item appears in AnaMatrix's few promotional screenshots of the time, like this one in that same issue of <i>MacUser</i>:

Or get out your wallet and spring for the big one. The most expensive unit I could find in the Apple price list was this Macintosh II with a 40MB hard disk for $5498 (M7003/A); in 2024 that would be nearly $15,000. This also suggests the price list here wasn't particularly current since it didn't include the IIx (September 1998), but it does have the SE (March 1987, with the II), dating it likely to the same year.

The actual invoices themselves were in the third application, Sales&bull;Point. Parenthetically, a separate menu option for "Transfer" allowed you to jump between the three apps in the suite if you didn't have enough memory to run them simultaneously in MultiFinder, or didn't use MultiFinder at all (which would give you all the machine's available RAM minus the operating system, as these about boxes show).

Here's that invoice "Bill Jones" bought: an ImageWriter II (A9M0320, $595) and a Macintosh SE with an Extended Keyboard (M5085/A, $2998); the other SE SKU would be for the smaller Apple Keyboard.

You could also run a sales report, but only two came up, "Bill Jones"' big cash splash included (I'm not sure if there were archives maintained off-machine).

That covers billing, inventory and sales, so how about advertising? For this next part we're going to spend some time with its copy of Aldus Persuasion 1.0. Interestingly, PowerPoint beat Persuasion to the Macintosh by about a year (1987 vs 1988), but Persuasion was for a time considered the superior product due to its interface, graphing capabilities and popular outline mode.

Two Aldus Persuasion 1.0 presentations stand out in particular (this is the copy which I've mounted on my Mystic Colour Classic for reasons I'll relate in a moment), both of which were official Apple marketing material at the time. The first is Apple's then-current product line, and the second is an early glimpse at the upcoming System 7. Neither file was apparently Apple-internal or confidential and both seem to have been regularly presented to potential customers and users.

The Macintosh Product Overview slides have a collective creation and modification date of October 8, 1989, consistent with the 1989 copyright the presentation displays. However, its actual origination can be no <em>later</em> than March 1989 due to the models that it completely lacks.

No unreleased or upcoming computers are demonstrated or referenced in this presentation, dividing the existing models simply into two small "Compact" and "Modular" families. This appears to have been the manifestation of Macintosh manager Jean-Louis Gass&eacute;e's "high-right" goal which tried to sell high-margin, high-performance machines at the expense of the "low-left" budget market. Unfortunately for Apple, the strategy permitted cheaper XT-class PCs to proliferate in Apple's relative absence while failing to compete effectively with Unix workstations at the top. In December 1989 Apple's stock tanked 20 percent after a dismal holiday sales season and Gass&eacute;e departed a month later, but this presentation doesn't reflect the subsequent product shakeup that birthed the deliberately low-end Mac Classic and LC.

The long-running Macintosh Plus was still in Apple's sales list but got one measly slide, strongly suggesting it was on its way out. The 2MB and 4MB versions were also completely absent from the presentation so as not to compete with the SE. Instead, the presenter talked up the SE and especially the SE/30, putting them head to head and otherwise ignoring the Plus completely. "Memory Management" refers to the Motorola 68851 MMU, available as an option for the 68020 (but not the 68000), which was built-in to the SE/30's 68030 and also slightly faster. The SE/30 came out in January 1989, so the presentation can't be any older than that.

The Modular family, however, only lists two members: the II and the IIx. This is where the maximum <em>late</em> date of March 1989 comes in, being when the IIcx was first introduced, the first three-slot II and the next one in the series. Since it doesn't appear here, the presentation can't be any (or at least much) later than the IIcx's formal introduction.

Still, the SE/30 and the IIx were indisputably the stars of this show, and the most obvious members of the "high-right" family at that time (early 1989). Other than the slots and form factor, the two systems were very similar, with the same CPU (with FPU and MMU), same clock speed and same RAM ceiling.
<p>
The Macintosh Product Overview slideshow was entirely 1-bit black and white, so I rendered it out to PICTs from the Portable itself for the most authentic result. However, the System 7 presentation has colour elements and the Portable doesn't support Color QuickDraw. For this section we'll go back to the Color Classic to render this slide deck, which I've tweaked slightly due to minor differences in font rendering. (I'm not sure how this particular presentation would have even displayed properly on the Portable.)

This presentation has a modification and creation date of February 3, 1991. Recall that around March 1988 Apple technical staff made the first cut of what was planned for System 7 as Blue, with the remainder becoming Pink (and later Taligent) and Red. This particular presentation is oriented around Blue's modest goals ("System 6, corrected," as Wikipedia puts it) and doesn't even mention Pink. However, the presentation shows a few more primitive or speculative features than what emerged with System 7.0 in May 1991, one technology in particular (we'll discuss) can't have appeared under that name any later than May 1990, and several 1990 models don't appear in the support matrix, putting an upper bound of around March 1990 on when the deck could have been made or updated. The presentation itself carries a 1989 copyright on the final slide.

Assuming this wasn't just a mockup screenshot, the Finder and general user interface had a number of noticeable differences from the released version of 7.0. The menu bar has slightly different options in slightly different order; this earlier version used Color instead of Label, and the Special menu came before it. System 7's help icon was also part of the "menu mass" like Mac OS 8, just with a help diamond, instead of being an icon off to the side as with Balloon Help.
<p>
Individual Finder windows also appeared differently: the window title bar is fatter and the detail row is slightly skewed down, not vertically centred. There are also different icons, including a schematic of the desktop for the Finder instead of the stylised compact Mac icon used in System 6 and (with revisions) 7.0, and the Startup Items folder is just called the Startup Folder with what looks like a placeholder graphic. As with the final release, the System file remains a suitcase.

System 7 was additionally the d&eacute;but of TrueType, Apple's outline font technology and still the dominant font format on most PCs and Macs (especially given that OpenType is more or less a superset), but the actual <em>name</em> TrueType appears nowhere in this presentation, nor do its known codenames Royal and Bass. That doesn't mean Apple wasn't proud of it. Indeed, it was such a big advance over font handling in System 6 that TrueType was subsequently backported to it, and Apple granted a license to Microsoft for free to ensure TrueType's success. Ironically this was one of the slides I had to tweak on the Color Classic because the font size of the blurb on the right came out too large.

System 7 also made MultiFinder mandatory. This screenshot cannot be contemporary with the Finder screenshot above because the small icon for the Finder is still System 6's; that makes this screenshot almost certainly older, which also explains why the MultiFinder application list is still in the Apple menu. On the other hand, no desk accessories are shown in the Apple menu either like one would expect with System 6 MultiFinder, so this is probably truly an early System 7 build assuming it's also not a mockup shot.

Newly introduced was a varied class of technologies related to message passing between applications, which is foundational for higher-level features like scripting and embedding. Apple subsumed these various features under the umbrella of the Inter-Application Communications Architecture, or the IAC. These messages could be passed between applications on the local machine or over a network, using AppleTalk as the transport. Today we call those messages Apple events, and the fundamental technology remains part of modern macOS today.

However, one of the IAC features that <em>didn't</em> succeed was the Editions Manager, later redacted to the Edition Manager and surfaced to the user as "Publish and Subscribe." In this scheme an application could "publish" part or all of a file that another application could "subscribe" to (more precisely, a document could have sections in it called "publishers" connected to "subscriber" sections in other documents). If this sounds like Microsoft's Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), it's deliberate, as Publish and Subscribe was supposed to be the OLE killer with non-rectangular regions and update notifications that could even go over a network &mdash; because the notifications were just Apple events. This has nothing to do <a href="/2023/10/teaching-apple-cyberdog-10-new-tricks.html">with OpenDoc</a>, by the way, which was Apple's second failed attempt at an OLE-like technology and uses a completely different internal architecture.
<p>
The Edition Manager ended up being complicated for developers and obnoxious for users. Since publication occurred at the section level, compliant applications had to define what sections existed in a document, and for those sections that were published write their contents (termed <i>editions</i>) to an escrow-like repository called an <i>edition container</i>. On the user end, this felt like doing a special "cut and paste" from a source into a client document to create a new section and link it. When the Edition Manager saw updates happen, it would fire off Apple events to signal subscribers to read that data from the edition container into their own sections; conversely, when the Edition Manager saw a subscriber try to read or scroll a section, it would fire off other Apple events to <em>publishers</em> to remind them to update.
<p>
None of this work was automatically done by the individual applications, though, so it wasn't unusual for publishers to fail to update their editions or subscribers to fail to retrieve them, or sometimes for the link to just break completely. I personally remember screaming at CricketGraph in 1996 trying to get charts in my undergraduate cognitive science paper within Microsoft Word to actually show anything, but to this day I still have no idea whose fault that was (except that it wasn't mine, dammit). Since the feature was rickety even in those applications that tried to support it and the level of developer headache was high, it ended up little used, and when OpenDoc eclipsed P&amp;S and then fizzled itself, the Edition Manager was "edited out" (heh heh) of Rhapsody and never implemented for Carbon.

But the part of the IAC that allowed applications to send events to other applications and manipulate them became a lasting feature. This is the basic functionality that AppleScript still uses, which is pretty much all about sending events to apps, and was the basis for the Program-to-Program Communications Toolbox (PPC Toolbox, unrelated to PowerPC, which didn't exist at this point) that underlaid program linking in System 7 as well. Program linking, in this case, specifically refers to allowing programs on remote Macs to send events to programs on yours. This was how you could remotely manipulate server programs running on other Macs, and was <a href="/2023/11/the-apple-network-servers-all-too.html">ported to AIX for the Apple Network Server so that "symbiotic applications"</a> could use the ANS for backend processing: the ANS looked like just another remote Mac you could send events to via AppleTalk, which the application on the local Mac could task with jobs and then asynchronously display their results. In Mac OS 9 TCP/IP became a supported transport for network Apple events and this capability <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/allow-remote-application-scripting-mchlp1398/mac">remains part of modern macOS</a> as well.

On the other hand, for sheer obscurity you couldn't beat CL/1. CL/1 was short for "Connection Language One" and originally developed by Network Innovations (unrelated to the current business bearing the name), a small company founded in 1984 and also based in Cupertino. Based around SQL but adding control structures for cursors, program logic and looping, CL/1 was intended for writing desktop-to-host applications to query remote databases on mainframes and large systems, transforming CL/1 programs into various SQL subqueries which were collected and returned. Unlike the later ODBC, most of this processing happened on the server, reducing network bandwidth but increasing server load and requiring an "adapter" program specific to the database engine in use. However, this also meant that client applications could be straightforward, simply shipping CL/1 programs to the remote server for execution and not requiring local processing other than the data that came back.
<p>
As both a practical demonstration and a sellable product, the company's first CL/1-based package, appropriately called Mac-to-VAX, allowed Mac applications to remotely access databases, files and applications on a DEC VAX server. Released in January 1988, CL/1 could use AppleTalk, DECnet, X.25, IBM 3270 and Apple’s implementation of IBM APPC/LU6.2 as transports. Apple was immediately attracted to the technology, seeing it as both advantageous for the Mac and as a possible standard they could control, and acquired the company in March as a subsidiary (its first acquisition of another technology company, as it happens). <!-- https://techmonitor.ai/technology/apple_extends_mac_to_host_focus_with_network_innovations_buy -->

The name CL/1 didn't last very long after the merger and the last reference I can find to it in industry sources is around May 1990 when its new name, Data Access Language (DAL), started appearing. Apple also scotched Network Innovations' originally planned ports to PC in 1990, determining to make DAL at least initially an Apple-exclusive technology. That said, while this slide implies Apple intended to include some portion of DAL-n&eacute;e-CL/1 with System 7, only the Data Access Manager (DAM) API became a built-in part of the operating system; the extension(s) implementing DAL proper for a given platform seem to have been a separate install and aren't on any of my System 7 disk sets. This is important to distinguish because the DAM just moves prefabricated DAL queries and replies back and forth and doesn't implement DAL itself.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjKGSLM7Z5TIKOe46YhXTu8Xct8vK2a2w6rzhvayskICY3Ofb9WW637l0fm1O8M0uWZVyeqCwOO72GoUqRQMaqIvQOO_VNz4KAF7usdhyphenhyphen0UlluGaCs084cJa4R56KxGN9IpOtOEXMoDqWuT3fRpCcoKvGGJSVx9Ot1sb7EXjz74bZMsqUXxmRZX6c_N0UY/s1420/dalcontentsm.jpeg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" height="320" data-original-height="1420" data-original-width="863" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjKGSLM7Z5TIKOe46YhXTu8Xct8vK2a2w6rzhvayskICY3Ofb9WW637l0fm1O8M0uWZVyeqCwOO72GoUqRQMaqIvQOO_VNz4KAF7usdhyphenhyphen0UlluGaCs084cJa4R56KxGN9IpOtOEXMoDqWuT3fRpCcoKvGGJSVx9Ot1sb7EXjz74bZMsqUXxmRZX6c_N0UY/s320/dalcontentsm.jpeg"/></a></div>

Post-System 7, DAL suffered from the intermittent attention span 1990s Apple exhibited with many of its projects. Its most impressive application was as an extension for HyperCard, where it facilitated some remarkable live demos and some of the earliest data-driven fat clients with full GUIs, causing a scramble by database vendors &mdash; notably Oracle &mdash; to implement their own toolkits. (This toolkit started as Format Verlag's Plus, became Oracle Card after Oracle's acquisition, and later became Oracle Media Objects, best known for the Mac version that ran on <a href="/2023/07/apples-interactive-television-box.html">the Apple Interactive Television Box prototype</a>.) While the client side remained Apple-specific, the server side became impressively cross-platform, growing to support IBM (VM/CMS, MVS/TSO, MVS/VTAM, DOS/VSE), DEC (VMS, Ultrix), SVR4, DG/UX, HP-UX, AIX, SunOS, Stratus AOS/VS II and Tandem Guardian C-30, running databases such as SQL/DS, IBM DB2, Teradata DBC/1012, CA-Datacom, CA-IDMS, Ingres, Informix (the database I had my first job out of college on), Oracle, Sybase, DEC Rdb, CA-DB, INFOS II, DG/SQL and Tandem NonStop/SQL. Apple also expanded the network transport options to include TCP/IP with the growing reach of the Internet.
<p>
Unfortunately for Apple, development for all these server permutations was expensive, reflected in very high prices for the adapter component, and the adapters also tended to incur performance problems largely from the overhead of translating and running DAL queries which were difficult to cache. While the concept of shared <i>query documents</i> in the Data Access Manager was at least in part intended to reduce this impact, few client applications ended up having much DAL code in common. Although EveryWare's ButlerSQL tried to rectify the translation issue by using DAL as its <em>native</em> language, the most notable of the few that attempted to do so, it ran on the classic Mac OS and its performance was instead limited by Mac OS's poor multitasking and throughput. (Apple was <a href="/2023/11/the-apple-network-servers-all-too.html">well aware of this problem</a>.) Developers also complained about DAL's lack of BLOB and cross-platform support, neither of which Apple did much to address. Apple did license DAL to Blyth Software to develop a Windows client but it got little traction or interest.
<p>
Meanwhile, ODBC grew dominant both due to DAL's technical stagnation and ODBC's greater throughput, especially as network bandwidth was dramatically increasing. Apple licensed DAL to Independence Technologies (ITI) in February 1994, who intended to release DAL 2.0 supporting blobs and to take over Windows development, while Apple maintained control of DAM in Mac OS. ITI got bought itself in 1995 by BEA Systems and sold again to UniPrise in 1996, but the promised update never emerged before UniPrise went out of business in 1998. The Data Access Manager, like the Edition Manager, faded from disuse and was never ported to Rhapsody or Carbon, and ODBC became the primary database access method even in the classic Mac OS. However, the TCP port used by DAL &mdash; port 172 &mdash; remains as <tt>cl/1</tt> in <tt>/etc/services</tt> to this day.

The other piece enabling us to more precisely date this presentation is its model support list: the latest models shown are the Macintosh IIci and the Portable itself, which both came out in September 1989. The next model in the chronology would have been the IIfx in March 1990, which doesn't appear here, so the presentation can't be later than that. Notice that the original Macintosh 128K, 512K and 512Ke are listed as "supported" &mdash; but only if you effectively make them into Macintosh Pluses first.

All this was an "alpha" view of the operating system. The mention of developer seeding is prominent and intentional; Apple remembered the incompatibilities that resulted from failing to widely disseminate System 6 to developers and was determined not to make the same mistake. This slide anticipated customer availability in "Summer 1990" but System 7.0 was not released until May 1991.
<p>
So let's say we're out in the field with these presentations, doing our thing, selling our wares, hyping our master. How did we call back to the mothership?

One of the online services on this Portable was the Macintosh client for <a href="http://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/932">Prodigy</a>, the famous graphical service that used modified NAPLPS graphics as its user interface. However, I didn't find any screens in its cache, suggesting it got hardly any use. Additionally, while Prodigy used Tymnet's X.25 dial-in network for its nationwide access, neither of these numbers appears in <a href="https://github.com/TYMNET/docs/blob/master/tymnet.txt">the 1990 Tymnet dial-in number list</a>. The main telephone number lacks an area code, though area code 614 was one of Ohio's original four area codes in the North American Numbering Plan encompassing Columbus and most of the state's southeast quadrant (Cleveland, for the record, was area code 216). 614 didn't split until 1998 when most of it became new area code 740.
<p>
These screenshots were done on the Mystic Color Classic in anticipation of being able to render out some of its <tt>STAGE.DAT</tt> contents, but there appears to be much less interest and support in the Prodigy retro-community for the Mac client, and I wasn't able to get anything recognizeable out of it. (The different endianness may be only one of many reasons why.) The low interest is somewhat understandable since the Mac client wasn't used much, and the Prodigy interface wasn't very Mac-like nor very popular with Macintosh users. Since it doesn't look like this person used it much either, we won't do anything further with it in this article.

But what our district manager did appear to use is AppleLink, and that's where we'll spend the remainder of our time.
<p>
AppleLink was a client-server service for Apple employees and dealers, and later developers, established in 1985 running over the General Electric Information Services (GEIS) nationwide Mark III network. (It is distinct from the later consumer-oriented but technically unrelated AppleLink Personal Edition, which later turned into America Online; we'll talk more about that and eWorld, AppleLink's intended successor, at the end.)

AppleLink's front-end was a fat GUI client to show remote resources as folders and files, and send and receive both public (i.e., bulletin-board) and private messages. This screenshot of a typical session in System 7 is from <i>Apple Confidential</i>.

The front end allows you to work offline, which is handy since of course there's no AppleLink server to connect to anymore, along with an extensive built-in help library to reference regardless of connection status. Unfortunately relatively few tasks could be completed without a network connection.

There wasn't any mail in the outbasket (darn), but we can fake some, and you could write messages for transmission later. There was no other mail on the system I could find.

E-mail &mdash; at least within the network itself &mdash; became one of the most well-known features of AppleLink, including the first E-mail message sent from space. These are pictures of mission specialists James C. Adamson and Shannon Lucid with an original non-backlit Macintosh Portable on <a href="https://www.wikiarchives.space/index.php?/category/837">NASA Space Shuttle Mission STS-43</a>, <i>Atlantis</i>' ninth mission from August 2 to August 11, 1991. It had been lightly modified with a circuit breaker on the battery charging system for safety but was otherwise stock except for some bushings under the trackball to take up slack.
<p>
The Portable was ostensibly transported into space for the purposes of Development Test Objective (DTO) 1208, Space Station Cursor Control Device Evaluation II and Advanced Applications, which tested the in-flight ergonomics of the Portable's onboard trackball, a 2-inch external ADB trackball, an ADB optical mouse and a modified aircraft control stick with a thumb ball hat. While most of the Space Shuttle laptops were PCs such as ThinkPads (with the notable exception of the <a href="/2023/01/solbournes-in-space.html">SPARC-based Solbourne PILOT</a>), the Portable was selected for this objective because it had a larger variety of commercially available input devices. The Portable was also used to record data from the Lower Body Negative Pressure experiment (LBNP, DSO 478), in which the astronauts evaluated use of the LBNP unit for drawing body fluids down to their legs to reverse counterflow under weightlessness, as well as shuttle flight path tracking using a custom application called MacSPoC ("SPoC" being short for "Shuttle Portable Computer") and acting as an alarm clock and scheduler. This latter function was assisted by a <a href="https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/huh-a-seiko-apple-smart-watch-is-set-to-hit-the-auction-block">Seiko WristMac</a> "databank" watch which downloaded reminders from the Portable to its 2K memory.
<p>
It's not clear whose idea the "space E-mail" was, but it was publicized by Apple as early <a href="https://tidbits.com/1991/07/29/applelink-in-space/">as July 1991</a> as a means for astronauts to communicate with family and exchange files and data. The Earthbound side was GEIS's regular packet-switched network (more about that in a moment) fed into a ROLM telephone switch, terminating in a data linkup to a ground-based Mac Portable via the printer port at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Apple wrote a "forwarder" which took those packets and sent them back out through the modem port to an actual modem whose signal was then digitized, bounced off a commercial satellite to the White Sands (New Mexico) Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System, and finally sent to a TDRSS satellite geosynchronous with Shuttle Atlantis. On the Shuttle side, the spacecraft received the signal as digital data and fed it as an analogue signal into an onboard modem connected to the Mac Portable. The same convoluted process in reverse handled injecting packets from the spacebound Mac Portable back into the GEIS network. From the point of view of the Mark III, this was just another packet-switched remote node, albeit one with an incredible amount of latency. Latency wasn't something that the stock AppleLink <em>client</em> handled well, however, so a modified version of AppleLink 6.0.2 went up with the Portable that had been tweaked to tolerate transmission delays.
<p>
The connection took several tries but Adamson and Lucid were able to successfully sent the first E-mail from space on August 9, to shuttle communicator Marcia Ivins at the JSC. The exact message contents <a href="https://tidbits.com/1991/08/19/mac-in-space-ii/">vary</a> between <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140216055859/https://support.apple.com/kb/TA30635">sources</a>, but in general the message read, in its entirety,
<p>
<div class="tx" style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">
Hello Earth ! Greetings from the STS-43 Crew. This is the first AppleLink from space. Having a __GREAT__ time, wish you were here,... send cry[o], and [R]CS! Have a nice day...... Haste la vista, baby,... we'll be back!
</div>
<p>
where "cry" or "cryo" refers to cryogenics (in this case, liquid oxygen for breathing), and "CS" or "RCS" refers to the Reaction Control System, i.e., fuel for thruster manoeuvres. The shuttle was able to receive E-mail as well but this address was kept secret from the public (and various obvious honeypots also set up) to prevent the astronauts from being deluged. 
<p>
That brings us to attempting to log in ourselves, and for that we should talk briefly about the backend this time. GEIS' roots extend to the 1962 Dartmouth Time Sharing System (DTSS), a proposal by Dartmouth College professors John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz to develop a free, open timesharing system for students. Kemeny and Kurtz established a partnership with General Electric in 1963 and got funding from the National Science Foundation to deploy a 1961 GE-225 mainframe for processing, a 20-bit system with a typical eight kilowords of core memory, paired with an 18-bit GE DATANET-30 ("DN-30") connected via DMA functioning as a terminal server. The DN-30 was itself a full general purpose computer but in this application it was fully dedicated to the task of scheduling jobs on the mainframe and servicing terminals, of which it could support up to 128. This double-system concept was considered unusual and even wasteful for the time, but by the autumn of 1964 the system was operating twenty terminals serving hundreds of users and upgraded seamlessly to a larger GE-235 with triple the memory speed. This first incarnation of DTSS was the system Kemeny and Kurtz developed BASIC on in 1963.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj15rYjjnkrnKOuRLCHYQGL5_EK47TnhBHaX4_CDltGeCqxd_E2hfU_MkmVmtHMuTnzI1Dke818N1zxTixecQkdjsmebee1kUALEWMuRZlC-YLwN1ZibUnZYagR0adZHOPdRvJzZfEYdbkvIGOpHkvGFgZY1N4uONgdhBZfrbYNrI8XMgl_PF-cMajP8ZE/s2906/ge645.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="1524" data-original-width="2906" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj15rYjjnkrnKOuRLCHYQGL5_EK47TnhBHaX4_CDltGeCqxd_E2hfU_MkmVmtHMuTnzI1Dke818N1zxTixecQkdjsmebee1kUALEWMuRZlC-YLwN1ZibUnZYagR0adZHOPdRvJzZfEYdbkvIGOpHkvGFgZY1N4uONgdhBZfrbYNrI8XMgl_PF-cMajP8ZE/s320/ge645.jpg"/></a></div>

Kemeny and Kurtz had initially wanted GE to enter into a research arrangement, but GE declined their proposal, and the original partnership was structed purely as a commercial sale. However, as DTSS grew successful GE became impressed with the flexibility of the architecture and decided to take a more active role in its development. Explicitly combining the GE-235 and DN-30 as the GE-265, GE started advertising timesharing services on their own systems in 1965 and building out a national network to allow access over dedicated lines. 
<p>
At the same time GE had developed a new 36-bit mainframe architecture supporting up to four CPUs and as much as 4MW of memory as a way to reduce their own dependence on IBM. The GE 600 series started with the GE-635 in 1963 (the above picture is a GE-645, a larger version with hardware support for Multics and virtual memory) which ran GE's GECOS "GE Comprehensive Operating Supervisor" batch processing system. By 1967 DTSS had been ported to the GE-635/DN-30 and GE adopted it as their "Mark II" network, retroactively dubbing their original GE-265 implementation as "Mark I." By 1968 GE controlled somewhere between a third and forty percent of the timesharing market, serving tens of thousands of users, and the timesharing unit became its own division in 1969.
<p>
In 1970 GE decided to exit the computing hardware business and offloaded the GE 600 series to Honeywell, who renamed it the Honeywell 6000 family. The Honeywell 6000s still used the same basic architecture and still ran GECOS, merely renaming it to GCOS ("<em>General</em> Comprehensive Operating <em>System</em>"), and GE started using their hardware instead. However, GE retained their profitable timesharing service, now transitioning to Honeywell hardware, developing a means for Mark II systems to submit batch jobs to GCOS in a seamless and nearly interactive fashion. This became the Mark III network in 1972.
<p>
GE's dominance of commercial timesharing grew even stronger in the 1970s with its high availability, facilitated by specialized clustering hardware allowing users to be spread over up to six mainframes and have the same view of the Mark II machines' filesystem, and three redundant international data centers equally accessible from anywhere in the world. GE also evolved their remote access operations into a packet-switched, telephone-accessible extended X.25 international network that was included with their services. In 1979 GE spun off their services division into the joint venture GEISCO (GE Information Services Company) with Honeywell but bought back Honeywell's portion in 1982, later renaming it to General Electric Information Services (GEIS). By the mid-1980s the Mark III network had local access numbers in over 750 cities and 31 countries, handling as many as five thousand simultaneous users. GE eventually added other network types such as IBM SNA and by the 1990s had four worldwide networks running on the same backbone.

In 1984 the original Macintosh was a hit for Apple but came with new costs of its own as the expense of maintaining its traditional dealer network was skyrocketing. Interminable games of "telephone tag" had already been a problem during the Apple II days and Apple was spending half a million dollars a year &mdash; in 1984 dollars &mdash; just to print price lists. Apple management reasoned that while setting up an electronic dealer network would itself be pricey, it would enable them to contain many of their distribution expenses, facilitate better communication, and allow them to outsource their existing timesharing system used for staff E-mail. Head of support John Ebbs, formerly a senior executive at General Electric, suggested his former company could help develop a useful service that could also show off the Mac at the same time.
<p>
Apple approached GEISCO in 1984, making a key requirement to use the Macintosh's graphical interface instead of the text-based terminal access GEISCO currently afforded users. For this GE engineers developed a GCOS backend called EF3 ("Error-Free") which the Macintosh client would act as an asynchronous interface for, and Apple contracted with Central Coast Software to write the front end, who developed it in Pascal. To encourage dealer adoption Apple subsidized the network somewhat by giving them a free hour of connect time per month and $15 an hour (in 2024 about $43) thereafter, though this rate was higher outside the United States. Unlike <a href="/2022/04/tonight-were-gonna-log-on-like-its-1979.html">services such as The Source</a>, Apple's service didn't run on leftover after-hours capacity and dealers were unlikely to connect when their shops were closed, so the rate didn't vary on the time of day. The first release and availability of the new AppleLink network was in fall 1985.

The AppleLink client version on this Macintosh Portable is 5.1. The original AppleLink 1.0 client for the first generation Macintosh was quickly upgraded for the Macintosh Plus in 1986 and I have one of these floppies with "Macintosh Plus Version" prominently stamped on it. Versions through at least 6.1 are known, with additional work done on the client by Bear River Associates, then in Berkeley and <a href="https://www.bearriver.com/about/">still in business</a> in Oakland. Later versions of the client upgrade to GE's later EFX "Error-Free eXtended" protocol which replaced EF3.
<p>
We know our Apple district manager used this because their credentials are in the dialogue box (which I've suppressed). I haven't suppressed the rest, though, because they're germane to understanding how the Mark III network operated. And where we can learn the most about it is from a much more famous online service that used it too: GEnie.

Separate from its work on AppleLink and related products we'll discuss at the end, GEIS had noted the rise of nascent consumer-oriented online services like <a href="/2022/04/tonight-were-gonna-log-on-like-its-1979.html">The Source</a> (then owned by Reader's Digest in partnership with Control Data Corporation) and CompuServe (a subsidiary of H&amp;R Block), and decided they could compete in the same market &mdash; but with less overhead and presumably more profitably, because they already had their own nationwide local access network, their own hardware and their own data centres. The job was tasked to <a href="http://www.billlouden.com/bio.html">Bill Louden</a>, CompuServe's former director of communications and one of history's candidates for coining the term "email," who transplanted facsimiles of CompuServe's most popular features to the new platform along with new content while carefully concealing its GCOS underpinnings. Reportedly the name "GEnie" came from Louden's wife after a $50,000 consultant disastrously proposed calling it "Albert" (Einstein), to which they added the backronym "General Electric Network for Information Exchange."
<p>
The new GEnie service launched in October 1985 with both 300bps and 1200bps access. Criticially, although GEnie did have on-peak and off-peak rates at a startling differential (launching at $35/hr prime-time 8am-6pm on weekdays but $5/hr otherwise, or in 2024 dollars about $100/hr and $14/hr respectively), GEnie undercut CompuServe by not charging a premium for 1200 baud connections, offsetting any additional cost from higher speed users against its excess unused computing time. Eventually 2400bps access was added as well, also at the same "flat" rates.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg-2vZlR88c-fjk4GeJpFSq3Bvw3lKrWUH42ISLQwfkZvBcN2w_e6FmVADF0N4dVkJfu4C88pDnbtvjTDf8k90onB_sXeCK2XyPnCc8kvaVQQB_83QGD2mTAprYhozPLDKBGvyurVZtZ35dd3Cak4TqwMuID2paq1faQIRl-nPyOgb_RYOanQgMDGandcM/s2500/pmbyrd.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" height="320" data-original-height="2500" data-original-width="1833" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg-2vZlR88c-fjk4GeJpFSq3Bvw3lKrWUH42ISLQwfkZvBcN2w_e6FmVADF0N4dVkJfu4C88pDnbtvjTDf8k90onB_sXeCK2XyPnCc8kvaVQQB_83QGD2mTAprYhozPLDKBGvyurVZtZ35dd3Cak4TqwMuID2paq1faQIRl-nPyOgb_RYOanQgMDGandcM/s320/pmbyrd.jpg"/></a></div>

A typical user would dial their local access number (8N1, local echo-half duplex preferred) and after successful connection send a series of <tt>H</tt> characters to get the network gateway's attention (contemporary sources said <tt>HHH</tt> and press RETURN, but really any sequence of at least two would be enough). The local gateway would then open an X.25 link to one of GE's datacentres, which responded with a famously terse login prompt. The initial dance looked a little like this (<b>bold</b> is what we type):
<p>
<div class="tx"><pre>
<b>ATDT5551234</b>

CONNECT 1200
<b>HHH</b>

U#=
</pre></div>
<p>
Signons to the Mark III network were of the general form <tt>XXX#####</tt>, <tt>X</tt> being a letter and <tt>#</tt> a number. The signons for creating a GEnie account (credit card required) often literally started with <tt>X</tt>, such as <tt>XJM11878</tt> or <tt>XTX99437</tt> &mdash; these were real signons that were in use at various times. It was then followed by a comma and the password, which was frequently <tt>GENIE</tt> or some such for the signup logins. If the login was accepted, they would proceed to the main menu, which in 1986 looked like this (from the manual):
<p>
<div class="tx"><pre>
U#=<b>XXX12345,PASSWORD</b>

The menus provided a guided way to access GEnie services, but under the hood everything was organized into numerical pages using the ubiquitous <tt>MOVE</tt> (<tt>M</tt> for short) command. The main "top" menu was always on page 1. While less-opaque word mnemonics also existed for many services (printed at the top centre, so the top menu's mnemonic was <tt>TOP</tt>), if you knew the number for a particular area or application, you could jump straight to it. Many users used GEnie exclusively for games such as Kesmai's Air Warrior and Simutronics' GemStone, which offered massively multiplayer experiences decades before modern MMOs, and had scripts in their terminal programs or clients to check messages and then start their favourite game immediately. (Like GEnie's competitors, popular services like these often had surcharges, which could sometimes be sizeable.) GemStone III, for example, was 1335, E-mail was on 200, and the LiveWire "CB Simulator" chat system was on 400.
<P>
In fact, the login sequence itself could even facilitate doing so immediately upon signon, saving valuable connect time. If you logged in as, say, <tt>XTX12345,password,625;1</tt> &mdash; remember this format, it will be relevant later &mdash; which followed the login and password with another comma, the page number, a semicolon, and an item number, this would immediately move to page 625 (this was the Commodore 8-bit "Flagship" RoundTable, GEnie jargon for a bulletin board) and select option 1 from its menu (in this case showing you a list of categories). The Commodore 8-bit community was especially concentrated on GEnie during its final years after the shutdown of QuantumLink in 1993, featuring <a href="https://cbmfiles.com/genie/index.php">a large filebase</a> and roundtable roster, and login scripts like <a href="https://cbmfiles.com/genie/geniefiles/C128Telecom/GENIE-II">this one for DesTerm 128</a> relied precisely on this capability (warning: PETSCII). On the Apple side, a separate GEnie roundtable for Macintosh users existed outside of AppleLink on page 605. Fortunately for user-to-user communication services like these, most of the system used friendlier alias names for accounts and generally relegated the network login to authentication and billing.

With GEnie's operation as context, we should be able to see all the pieces in the setup dialogue necessary to start reverse-engineering the AppleLink signon process. The phone number has no area code, but 362-XXXX is one of the prefixes for nearby San Jose in Apple's home area code 408 (and since this user was dialing without an area code at the time, this system must have been local to the gateway). Although GEIS never published a comprehensive printed list of its access numbers that I could find, it's most likely that the machine on the other end was an Apple-provided gateway with a leased line into the GE network (though for the record Apple's telephone exchange in Cupertino generally looks like 408-996-XXXX). This Portable is fitted with an Apple internal 1200bps modem which was what this system was originally configured to call out through. However, you can also route the call via (using the Portable CDEV) the modem port or (this screen) the printer port to an external modem or other serial link.
<p>
As for the signon, we can see a Mark III login of the standard format in this window, here called the "System number." Knowing what we know about GEnie, that means the signon to access (at least this instance of) AppleLink was <tt>NJL37300</tt> and the password was <tt>Apple</tt> (note the comma between them), but this clearly couldn't be an individual user's identifier. The AppleLink ID <em>is</em> populated (I've only censored it), so it must transmit it somehow.
<p>
The way we find out is by looking at AppleLink's CCL scripts. CCL stands for Communications Control Language, a simple domain-specific scripting language that originated with the AppleLink client as a means of adding and adjusting connection methods without having to constantly update the main application. They work essentially by emitting strings, or, for control flow, branching on a matched string to a specified numeric label, along with a small set of register variables and special keywords to manipulate the serial port. CCL outlasted its original purpose: an updated form became the modem scripting language for Apple Remote Access, was updated again for Mac OS X through 10.4 Tiger to remove its dependency on string resources, and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/HardwareDrivers/Reference/CCLScriptingRef/CCLCommands/CCLCommands.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40005464-CH4-SW1">was updated a final time in 10.5 Leopard</a> to support strings in property lists. While most people no longer use modems and Macs haven't included them in years, the infrastructure remains supported in modern macOS for things like external USB modems and serial ports, and you can still find your Mac's available CCLs in <tt>/Library/Modem Scripts</tt>.
<p>
It will be easiest for us to spoof AppleLink by pretending to be a regular Hayes-compatible modem, and AppleLink has a CCL for that called <tt>USAModem.CCL</tt>. Happily, these scripts are regular MacRoman and readable with a text editor. Here are some extracts.
<p>

<p>
The string "Signalling the modem" emitted by the keyword <tt>DsplyMsg</tt> is the current connection status, and is displayed within the connection dialogue box like so:

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMnqBvXeXRzYQu8DHR3ZI-_bEprjiIaHd8ayJj-0eQ5u6jPyU1bpPrQoqAGwfC7I_ALIrP0uu0STcSjKjGJeP6pIqgmE_LHKs5WP9EPZD5kl9cQmgkdXwAmwV0mA8yjnYOe5cqR1U_dQYeNGwcNxSINSNXVhtKy7ftPhIHOzJ2FNEYf14KC0aunTHIoDs/s640/Screen%200.PNG" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="400" data-original-width="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMnqBvXeXRzYQu8DHR3ZI-_bEprjiIaHd8ayJj-0eQ5u6jPyU1bpPrQoqAGwfC7I_ALIrP0uu0STcSjKjGJeP6pIqgmE_LHKs5WP9EPZD5kl9cQmgkdXwAmwV0mA8yjnYOe5cqR1U_dQYeNGwcNxSINSNXVhtKy7ftPhIHOzJ2FNEYf14KC0aunTHIoDs/s320/Screen%200.PNG"/></a></div>

This segment then goes on to set the strings it intends to respond to. The <tt>MatchStr</tt> keyword takes three arguments, a string slot (only a fixed number of strings can be searched for at once), a label to branch to if the string is matched, and then the string itself. Matching occurs automatically as text is received and matches do not (indeed usually don't) need to match the entire received string. It next sends an AT command <tt>ATS0=0E0X4V1</tt> followed by a carriage return, which sets modem register 0 to 0 (never auto-answer), turns off echo, turns on busy signal and dial tone detection, and requests verbose English responses. If the pause of 180 tenths of a second expires without a matching string being received, it increments a variable and tries again, branching after three tries to label 47 which aborts with a timeout error. We'll assume the modem replied with <tt>OK</tt>, which will move us to label 2.

(Comment lines start with <tt>!</tt>, or could be appended with whitespace after a valid statement.) The <tt>DsplyPic</tt> keyword lights up one of the icons in the connection dialogue, in this case the first one, and then the next string is shown, which interpolates the built-in variable <tt>FONE</tt> to show the user the telephone number:

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj_KwM6umXOmGZ_fuzdedvEhxn2V9hGaHOHaWnyN6KT6AODprf1T5w94zRUNrbjjlLtCw9ru65vpxbv_ypxg6Y_5b9VC2qJEYQ4of2j87CqXA1QlkOEpQYqNt0ufPB7kPMWEDVF6M9R-G0UErgdltce6JfdOMbMqWuLJKnx8YnamzoCkKA_8eXL1rtHWZM/s640/Screen%201.PNG" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="400" data-original-width="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj_KwM6umXOmGZ_fuzdedvEhxn2V9hGaHOHaWnyN6KT6AODprf1T5w94zRUNrbjjlLtCw9ru65vpxbv_ypxg6Y_5b9VC2qJEYQ4of2j87CqXA1QlkOEpQYqNt0ufPB7kPMWEDVF6M9R-G0UErgdltce6JfdOMbMqWuLJKnx8YnamzoCkKA_8eXL1rtHWZM/s320/Screen%201.PNG"/></a></div>

The dial string is then constructed from the Hayes <tt>ATD</tt> command, whether tone or pulse dialing in the built-in variable <tt>TONE</tt>, and then the phone number. If it successfully gets any unambiguous part of the string <tt>CONNECT</tt>, it will assume success and move on to label 4. Strings like <tt>BUSY</tt> and <tt>CARRIER</tt> (as in <tt>NO CARRIER</tt>) branch to their own handlers. If the connection doesn't go through and isn't otherwise handled, the <tt>JSR 20</tt> calls a subroutine at label 20 which tries to hang up and reset the modem before dialing again.

Having apparently connected, we now set up a match to respond to the GCOS login prompt and send two H characters to get network attention. If we get the magic <tt>U#</tt> (notice no equals sign, even though one would be sent), we move to label 30. This is a bit more complex:

<em>Now</em> we see the structure of the logon string it's sending: the AppleLink ID and its password (separately prompted for) are appended as a parameters, apparently twice and followed by several other keywords and variables, though we don't know the exact content of all these variables yet. We can also see all the possible messages GCOS could send back, most of which are errors, like (<tt>SER</tt>)<tt>VICE INTERRUPTED</tt> or (<tt>SY</tt>)<tt>SYEM UNAVAIL</tt>(<tt>ABLE</tt>). Only one of these, what looks like <tt>SYSTEM REA</tt>(<tt>DY</tt>), actually leads to a success state, and that's label 36:
<p>
<div class="tx"><pre>

<p>
This starts the client's EFX handler and then exits back into the application with return code 0, indicating success. The failure labels all return with -1.
<p>
Now that we know what the connection script is looking for, we can type the responses it's expecting back to it. To avoid any potential conflicts with the internal modem, I'll configure AppleLink to communicate via the printer port to a null modem connected with my Raptor Talos II. (Impressively, this client version supports up to 19.2kbps, which would have been quite something in 1991. Those speeds may have been intended for direct serial connections.) You'll note the script is explicitly terminating everything it sends with a carriage return, so for display purposes we'll have <tt>picocom</tt> translate those to line feeds. Again, <b>bold</b> is what I typed back.
<p>
<div class="tx"><pre>

<p>
I'm not sure why the exact same user string is sent twice except with an exclamation point, but the rest includes the client version and presumably an encoded date of revision instead of today's date. This seems to be everything the mainframe would need to fire up EFX and start communicating with the client.

Indeed, all of the preceding screenshots were generated with that very sequence, demonstrating the client will accept our responses. But unfortunately I don't know anything about EFX, so we can't currently fake anything further. I don't see any activity on the serial port despite this message and we inevitably time out.

... and then this final message before the client gives up completely, which I suspect our intrepid astronauts on Space Shuttle Atlantis also got a few times, though for a completely different reason.
<p>
Let's finish the AppleLink story before we close. By the end of 1985 AppleLink was a roaring success, at least in user terms, handling over 4,000 calls a day. This demonstrated to GE the concept could have some utility to other corporations besides Apple, and in December 1985 GE decided to use the same technology as AppleLink in their own product, Businesstalk. Businesstalk was envisioned for any company with a large dealer network, not just computer companies, many of which would have been battling the same problems and expenses. The client was also Mac-specific and built with the same codebase, at least initially, but GEISCO's charges were heftier at $35/hr prime time and $18/hr off, presumably with the assumption that (like Apple) interested companies would partially subsidize the rate. To GE's dismay few seemed interested, so in February 1986 GE relaunched Businesstalk as Dealertalk, using the same Mac client but instead at an introductory price of $9900 that included a site license, 15 days of training and 100 hours of free connect time. The price was intended to stoke interest since GE threatened it would rise to $20,000 after July 31. It was similarly unsuccessful.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgRkpDETA21eQesqKkh10Qx6SPY4bEqTSWd-5LioRwyIsHpHLvonDsDh-iOEoykLsgrDci1gmOyM6r532UCp1_kUymgtP_MqpRwVqe0jUn1iBoqPOz1_EbubH9ChUR2CAX7VZ1RSB4munztBFu7m3zqXGTTno1Y_rkquLiyLu4ppW2koRbRhxpROnbzEnw/s1600/btalk.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="1134" data-original-width="1600" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgRkpDETA21eQesqKkh10Qx6SPY4bEqTSWd-5LioRwyIsHpHLvonDsDh-iOEoykLsgrDci1gmOyM6r532UCp1_kUymgtP_MqpRwVqe0jUn1iBoqPOz1_EbubH9ChUR2CAX7VZ1RSB4munztBFu7m3zqXGTTno1Y_rkquLiyLu4ppW2koRbRhxpROnbzEnw/s320/btalk.jpg"/></a></div>

<!-- IW 12/86-->In December 1986 GE tried once more under the BusinessTalk name again (but note the camel case), unveiling a PC client alongside the Mac version and marketing the service more as a corporate private bulletin board. It was still $20,000 and the rate crept up to $36/hour, but there was no limit on the number of clients that could connect. Possibly it was the unlimited number of machines or maybe eliminating the requirement to buy Macintoshes, but either way the third time was finally a charm. By 1989 (the screenshot is from Infoworld showing the MS-DOS version of BusinessTalk 5.0; compare similarities with the AppleLink shot) users could communicate with other corporate E-mail systems like Wang Office, DEC All-in-1 and IBM DISOSS and could even send messages by fax. While it was still $20,000 to start, GE had enough business that the connect rates were a more modest $23/hr prime and $15/hr off by then, and Business Talk became used by diverse companies such as financial company Charles Schwab to form SchwabLink. Despite being notionally separate universes, Business Talk instances and AppleLink nevertheless all ran on the same platform, and messages could be sent and received between each other as well. (These later software clients likely used a form of EFX also, so it may be possible to figure out how it worked from them, but probably even fewer examples of those still survive.)
<p>
Meanwhile, although allegedly saving them more than they spent, Apple was chafing under the substantial amount of money they paid GE to keep AppleLink operational. As more dealers and developers joined the system, the more expensive it got (<i>Apple Confidential</i> cited a ballpark fee of $30 million annually), and GE was unwilling to renegotiate. It even got bad enough that Apple later sold CD-ROMs with AppleLink content on them as a cheaper "offline" version to dampen interest.
<p>
In 1987 Apple approached Steve Case, then running Quantum Computer Services and the very successful QuantumLink online service for the Commodore 64, to develop a cheaper alternative to which AppleLink content could eventually be transferred. AppleLink Personal Edition ran atop Quantum's Stratus-based platform via Telenet and d&eacute;buted first on the Apple II in May 1988, but Apple and Quantum squabbled over the future direction of the service and users complained about missing features that the "real" AppleLink had. (In addition, some of GE's code and protocols were allegedly used without permission, further souring the relationship.) Apple eventually paid off Quantum to get out of the contract and the Mac version as such was never released. Instead, Quantum used that money to finish the Mac client without the Apple branding but using the same underlying infrastructure, and in 1991 that client became part of Quantum's new America Online.

Although Apple had managed to cut AppleLink costs somewhat in the meantime, continued high expenditures eventually caused the company to open a new request for proposals, and in 1992 they went back to Quantum again which was now also called America Online. In return for Apple paying AOL royalties, Apple would receive a stake in the company and layer an AppleLink replacement on top of AOL's infrastructure that would additionally be offered to consumers. Due to Apple corporate turmoil the new online service, christened eWorld, didn't launch until June 1994 and ended up directly competing with other new and established ones like AOL itself, Delphi, CompuServe, Prodigy and, yes, GEnie. Apple had priced its hourly rates high to temper demand, but that ended up working too well, and they failed to even include it consistently with new Macs they sold. Apple eventually forced the issue by moving employees from AppleLink to eWorld to beef up traffic and, after Gil Amelio cancelled eWorld in March 1996, started migrating to Web-based intranet alternatives rather than move people back. AppleLink was finally shut down on March 31, 1997.

As it happens, a similar process happened with GEIS. In April 1992 GE announced plans for BusinessTalk 2000, a repackaging of the service adding a Windows client to its Mac and DOS support, X.400 and X.500 message exchange, more online databases for access, and single seats starting as low as $279 (the site license increased to $30,000). By then, however, the growing Internet had started to erode customer interest in proprietary network products, especially GEIS' core Electronic Data Interchange services. GEnie, though still successful, suffered from a lack of expansion because it was only ever intended to use up excess computing capacity and GEIS' weakening revenue couldn't justify additional hardware. GEIS sold it off in 1996 as other clients started moving away from GE's proprietary services to Web-based alternatives (the screenshot above of the historical GEIS website comes from <a href="https://www.ammannato.it/geis-alumni/">this remembrance</a>). Both GEnie (under new owners Yovelle and later telecom IDT) and the Mark III network eventually succumbed to Y2K, as the GCOS version in use didn't handle it and it would have been too costly to move them to new platforms, and both shut down in December 1999. The majority of GEIS was reorganized as GXS (GE Global Exchange Services) in 2000, spun off in 2002, and subsequently bought out by OpenText in 2014.

## 2024-03-02 Oddµ themes

date: 2024-03-02, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>2024-03-02 Oddµ themes</h1>

<p>I’ve been working on <a href="oddmu/themes/index">themes</a>.</p>

<p>I recently saw two examples of chat-like interfaces for things that were regular text files or web pages. One was the app <a href="https://andadinosaur.com/gibberish-is-now-available-on-testflight">Gibberish</a> by <a class="account" href="https://mastodon.social/@zhenyi" title="@zhenyi@mastodon.social">@zhenyi</a>, and earlier I had seen the <a href="https://anhvn.com/media/">media diary</a> by <a class="account" href="https://mastodon.online/@latte" title="@latte@mastodon.online">@latte</a>.</p>

<p>And I wondered. It feels a bit like we&rsquo;re used to chat. It gives us that feeling of intimacy. Would I want that extra emotional push to get me to write, or would I abhor the idea of publishing something that I wrote in a vulnerable moment? Or is it more like those toot-storms of people that turn their blog posts into a post-per-paragraph? You know who I mean. 😅</p>

<p>My previous website engine had comments but my blog didn&rsquo;t have many commenters. Often it was just me, appending stuff! Which is why my current engine has both &ldquo;edit&rdquo; and &ldquo;add&rdquo; actions. And themes. And I started thinking… Shouldn&rsquo;t it be possible to… maybe… ah yes! And here it is: A <a href="oddmu/themes/chat/README">chat theme</a> for the website engine that has the &ldquo;add&rdquo; action at the bottom of every page, and renders paragraphs like speech bubbles. It looks… very different.</p>

<p>(Being able to just paste some HTML into my pages makes me happy…)</p>

<p>I was talking about this on fedi with <a class="account" href="https://merveilles.town/@bouncepaw" title="@bouncepaw@merveilles.town">@bouncepaw</a> and said I could perhaps take the usernames, do some hashing on them and give bubbles random colors? Or the &ldquo;owner&rdquo; gets coloured bubbles and everybody else is simple &ldquo;a guest&rdquo;? As soon as more people can add to a page, it gets complicated. Do I add names?</p>

<p>In his reply, Timur reminded me of the fact I would need a special syntax for that and how the syntax to denote authors on Community Wiki was not ideal. In the end, he ended with: “it&rsquo;s impossible to keep a publishing system pure Markdown.”</p>

<p>It’s the truth. 😳</p>

<p>Let’s try not to complicate things. Perhaps a little HTML would go a long way, for example. 😅</p>

## Trump Wins Missouri, Idaho Caucuses, Sweeps Michigan Republican Convention

date: 2024-03-02, from: VOA News USA

COLUMBIA, MISSOURI — Former President Donald Trump continued his march toward the Republican nomination Saturday, winning caucuses in Idaho and Missouri and sweeping the delegate haul at a party convention in Michigan.


Trump earned every delegate at stake Saturday, bringing his count to 244 compared with 24 for former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. A candidate needs to secure 1,215 delegates to clinch the Republican nomination.


The next event on the Republican calendar is Sunday in the District of Columbia. Two days later is Super Tuesday, when 16 states will hold primaries on what will be the largest day of voting of the year outside of the November election. Trump is on track to lock up the nomination days later.


Here's a look at Saturday's contests:


Michigan


Michigan Republicans at their convention in Grand Rapids began allocating 39 of the state's 55 Republican presidential delegates. Trump won all 39 delegates allocated.


But a significant portion of the party's grassroots force skipped the gathering because of the lingering effects of a monthslong dispute over the party's leadership.


Trump won Michigan's primary this past Tuesday with 68% of the vote compared with Haley's 27%.


Michigan Republicans were forced to split their delegate allocation into two parts after Democrats, who control the state government, moved Michigan into the early primary states, violating the national Republican Party's rules.


Missouri


Voters lined up outside a church in Columbia, home to the University of Missouri, before the doors opened for the caucuses. Once they got inside, they heard appeals from supporters of the candidates.


"Every 100 days, we're spending $1 trillion, with money going all over the world. Illegals are running across the border," Tom Mendenall, an elector for Trump in 2016 and 2020, said to the crowd. He later added: "You know where Donald Trump stands on a lot of these issues."


Christensen, a 31-year-old from Columbia who came to the caucus with his wife and three children ages 7, 5, and 2, then urged Republicans to go in a new direction.


"I don't need to hear about Mr. Trump's dalliances with people of unsavory character, nor do my children," Christensen said to the room. "And if we put that man in the office, that's what we're going to hear about all the time. And I'm through with it."


Supporters quickly moved to one side of the room or the other, depending on whether they favored Trump or Haley. There was little discussion between caucus-goers after they chose a side.


This year was the first test of the new system, which is almost entirely run by volunteers on the Republican side.


The caucuses were organized after Republican Gov. Mike Parson signed a 2022 law that, among other things, canceled the planned March 12 presidential primary.


Lawmakers failed to reinstate the primary despite calls to do so by both state Republican and Democratic party leaders. Democrats will hold a party-run primary on March 23.


Trump prevailed twice under Missouri's old presidential primary system.


Idaho


Last year, Idaho lawmakers passed cost-cutting legislation that was intended to move all of the state's primaries to the same date in May. But the bill inadvertently eliminated the presidential primaries entirely.


The Republican-led Legislature considered holding a special session to reinstate the presidential primaries but failed to agree on a proposal in time, leaving both parties with presidential caucuses as the only option.


"I think there's been a lot of confusion because most people don't realize that our Legislature actually voted in a flawed bill," said Jessie Bryant, who volunteered at a caucus site near downtown Boise. "So the caucus is really just the best-case scenario to actually get an opportunity to vote for a presidential candidate and nominate them for the (Republican Party)."


The Democratic caucuses aren't until May 23.

## US Airdrops of Humanitarian Aid Into Gaza Explained

date: 2024-03-02, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The United States on Saturday began airdrops of emergency humanitarian assistance into Gaza. President Joe Biden, who announced the operation Friday, said the U.S. was looking into additional ways to help Palestinians in the Hamas-ruled territory as the Israel-Hamas war goes on. Here is a look at what to know:


When did the airdrops start?


Three C-130 cargo planes from Air Forces Central dropped 66 bundles containing about 35,000 meals into Gaza at 8:30 a.m. EST Saturday. The bundles were dropped in southwest Gaza, on the beach along the territory’s Mediterranean coast, one U.S. official said.


The airdrop was coordinated with the Royal Jordanian Air Force, which has been airdropping food and took part in Saturday’s mission.


More airdrops are expected to follow.




Why now?


Biden's decision comes after at least 115 Palestinians were killed and more than 750 others were injured Thursday trying to access aid in northern Gaza under disputed circumstances, according to Gaza’s Hamas-run Health Ministry. Witnesses said Israeli troops opened fire as huge crowds raced to pull goods off an aid convoy, while Israel has said that it fired only when its troops felt threatened and that most of the civilian casualties were from trampling.


The U.S. has been pushing Israel to speed the flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza and to open a third crossing into the territory, but the violence Thursday showed the challenges no matter the circumstances.


“The loss of life is heartbreaking," Biden said as he announced his decision to order airdrops. "People are so desperate.”


How will the U.S. ensure aid gets to where it's needed?


Asked how the U.S. would keep the supplies from falling into Hamas' hands, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters that the U.S. would learn over the course of the aerial operation.


“There’s few military operations that are more complicated than humanitarian assistance airdrops," he said. Kirby said Pentagon planners will identify drop locations aiming to balance getting the aid closest to where it's needed without putting those on the ground in harm's way from the drops themselves.


“The biggest risk is making sure nobody gets hurt on the ground,” Kirby said. He said the U.S. is also working through how the airdropped aid will be collected and distributed once it's on the ground.


Will it make a difference?


The U.S. believes the airdrops will help address the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, but they are no replacement for trucks, which can transport far more aid more effectively — although Thursday's events also showed the risks with ground transport.


Kirby said the airdrops have an advantage over trucks in that planes can move aid to a particular location very quickly. But in terms of volume, the airdrops will be "a supplement to, not a replacement for, moving things in by ground.”


What else can be done?


The U.S. and allies have tried to broker a new temporary cease-fire between Hamas and Israel that would see the release of more hostages held by the militant group in Gaza, the freeing of some Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and an up-to-six-week pause in the fighting.


If a cease-fire were secured, the U.S. hopes it would allow large quantities of aid to flow into Gaza over a sustained period. Biden said Friday the U.S. was working with allies on establishing a “maritime corridor” to provide assistance to Palestinians from the sea.

## Governor Abbott: Texas Wildfires May Have Destroyed Up to 500 Structures

date: 2024-03-02, from: VOA News USA

STINNETT, TEXAS — Wildfires may have destroyed as many as 500 structures in the Texas Panhandle, Governor Greg Abbott said Friday, describing how the largest blaze in state history scorched everything in its path and left ashes in its wake.


Texas officials warned that the threat was not yet over. Higher temperatures and stronger winds forecast for Saturday elevated worries that fires in the Panhandle could spread beyond the more than 4,400 square kilometers (1,700 square miles) already chewed up this week by fast-moving flames.


The largest blaze, the Smokehouse Creek fire, which began Monday, has killed at least two people and left a charred landscape of scorched prairie, dead cattle and burned-out homes. The cause of the fire remains under investigation, although strong winds, dry grass and unseasonably warm weather fed the flames.


“When you look at the damages that have occurred here, it’s just gone, completely gone nothing left but ashes on the ground,” Abbott said during a news conference in Borger, Texas. He said a preliminary assessment found 400 to 500 structures had been destroyed.


Abbott praised what he called a “heroic” response from “fearless” firefighters.


“It would have been far worse and far more damaging not just to property but to people, but for those firefighters,” he said.


The National Weather Service forecast for the coming days warns of strong winds, relatively low humidity and dry conditions that pose a “significant" wildfire threat.


“Everybody needs to understand that we face enormous potential fire dangers as we head into this weekend,” Abbott said. “No one can let down their guard. Everyone must remain very vigilant.”


In the hard-hit town of Stinnett, population roughly 1,600, families who evacuated due to the Smokehouse Creek fire returned Thursday to devastating scenes: melted street signs and charred frames of cars and trucks. Homes reduced to piles of ash and rubble. An American flag propped up outside a destroyed house.


“We had to watch from a few miles away as our neighborhood burned,” Danny Phillips said, his voice trembling with emotion.


Phillips’ one-story home was still standing, but several of his neighbors weren't so fortunate.


The Smokehouse Creek fire has also crossed into Oklahoma, and the Texas A&M Forest Service said Friday that it has merged with another fire. It was 15% contained Friday afternoon, up from 3% on Thursday.


Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said individual ranchers could suffer devastating losses due to the fires, but he predicted the overall impact on the Texas cattle industry and consumer beef prices would be minimal.


Two women were confirmed killed by the fires this week. But with flames still menacing a wide area, authorities haven't yet thoroughly searched for victims or tallied homes and other structures damaged or destroyed.


Cindy Owen was driving in Texas' Hemphill County south of Canadian on Tuesday afternoon when she encountered fire or smoke, said Sergeant Chris Ray of the state's Department of Public Safety. She got out of her truck, and flames overtook her.


A passerby found Owen and called first responders, who took her to a burn unit in Oklahoma. She died Thursday morning, Ray said.


The other victim, an 83-year-old woman, was identified by family members as Joyce Blankenship, a former substitute teacher. Her grandson, Lee Quesada, said deputies told his uncle Wednesday that they had found Blankenship’s remains in her burned home.


President Joe Biden, who was in Texas on Thursday to visit the U.S.-Mexico border, said he directed federal officials to do “everything possible” to assist fire-affected communities, including sending firefighters and equipment. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has guaranteed Texas and Oklahoma will be reimbursed for their emergency costs, the president said.


When disasters strike, there’s no red states or blue states where I come from,” Biden said. “Just communities and families looking for help.”


Abbott has issued a disaster declaration for 60 counties.

When I was a grad student in Comp Sci, I was a teaching assistant for a class in <a href="https://ece252.ece.wisc.edu/ch07_inclass_01_assembly_language.pdf">assembly language</a> programming for a couple of years. One of my responsibilities was to grade the work of the students. Later, I was the CEO and lead developer at a software company I founded, and there I had to review other people's source code. I was pretty fussy about writing understandable code, because it was my job in both places to understand their code, and I also knew, even when I was just a TA, how important it is that your code be human-readable, not just machine-readable. I just want to say if ChatGPT were a student of mine, its code would get an A+, with thanks from the teacher for making my life easier.

## Pluralistic: Brinkwhump Linkdump (02 Mar 2024)

date: 2024-03-02, from: Cory Doctorow's blog

Today's links Brinkwhump Linkdump: A varied mixture for the weekend. This day in history: 2009, 2014, 2019 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading Brinkwhump Linkdump (permalink) Once again, I find myself arriving at the weekend with a giant backlog of links, triggering a linkump, the 15th such dumpage, a variety-pack of miscellany for your weekend. Here's the previous editions: https://pluralistic.net/tag/linkdump/ Let's start with the latest incredible news from KPMG, the accounting and auditing giant that is relied upon as a source of ground truth for a truly terrifying share of the world's economy. KPMG has a well-deserved reputation for incompetence and corruption. They first came on my radar in 2001 when they sent a legal threat to a blogger for linking to their website without permission: https://memex.craphound.com/2001/12/05/reason-4332442-not-to-ask/ The actual link was to KPMG's corporate anthem, which remains, to this day, a banger: https://web.archive.org/web/20040428063826/http://chkpt.zdnet.com/chkpt/uknewsita/http://anthems.zdnet.co.uk/anthems/kpmg.mp3 Don't miss the DJ remixes (and the Nokia ringtone!) that the internet thoughtfully provided when KPMG decided that it didn't want the world to know about "Our Vision of Global Strategy": https://web.archive.org/web/20011128153057/http://corporateanthems.raettig.org/ Now all this is objectively very funny, a relic of the old, good internet from one of its moments of glory, but KPMG? They were already enshittifying, even in 2001, and the enshittification only intensified thereafter. Nearly every accounting scandal of the past quarter-century has KPMG in it somewhere, from con-artists selling exhausted oil fields to rubes: https://www.desmog.com/2021/06/03/miller-energy-kpmg-auditors-oil-fraud/ To killer nursing homes that hire KPMG to audit its books &#8211; and to advise it on how to defeat safety audits and murder your grandma: https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/09/dingo-babysitter/#maybe-the-dingos-ate-your-nan They're the architects of Microsoft's tax-evasion plot: https://www.propublica.org/article/the-irs-decided-to-get-tough-against-microsoft-microsoft-got-tougher And they were behind Canada's dysfunctional covid contact-tracing app, which never worked, but generated tens of millions in billings to the government of Canada, who used KPMG to hire programmers at $1,500/day, plus KPMG's 30% commission: https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/31/mckinsey-and-canada/#comment-dit-beltway-bandits-en-canadien KPMG's most bizarre scandal is literally stranger than fiction. The company bribed SEC personnel help its own accountants cheat on ethics exams. The corrupt officials were then given high-paid jobs at KPMG: https://www.nysscpa.org/news/publications/the-trusted-professional/article/sec-probe-finds-kpmg-auditors-cheating-on-training-exams-061819 I mean it when I say this is stranger than fiction. I included it as a plot-point in my new finance crime novel The Bezzle (now a national bestseller!), and multiple readers have written to me since the book came out a couple weeks ago to say that they thought I was straining their credulity by making up such an outrageous scandal: https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865878/thebezzle But all of that is just scene-setting (and a gratuitous plug for my book) for the latest KPMG scandal, which is, possibly, the most KPMG scandal of all KPMG scandals. The Australian government hired KPMG to audit Paladin, a security contractor that oversees the asylum seekers the country locks up on one of its island gulags (yes, gulags, plural). Ever since, Paladin has been the subject of a string of ghastly human rights scandals &#8211; the worst stuff imaginable, rape and torture and murder of adults and children. Paladin made AU423 million on this contract. And here's the scandal: KPMG audited the wrong company. The Paladin that the Australia government paid KPMG to audit was based in Singapore. The Paladin that KPMG audited was a totally different company, based in Papua New Guinea, who already had a commercial relationship with KPMG. It was this colossal fuckup that led to the manifestly unfit Singaporean company getting nearly half a billion dollars in public funds: https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/feb/24/incredible-failure-kpmg-rejects-claims-it-assessed-the-wrong-company-before-423m-payment-to-paladin KPMG denies this. KPMG denies everything, always. Like, they denied creating "power maps" of decision-makers in the Australian government to target with influence campaigns in order to win contracts like this one. Who knows, maybe, this one time, they're telling the truth? After all, the company whose employees gather to sing lyrics like these can't be all bad, right? The time is now to lead the way, We share the same the idea That may win by the end of the day. Our strength is here to stay. Identity, one energy, One strategy, with sympathy. These are the words that will lead us into a new world. https://everything2.com/title/KPMG+corporate+anthem You may find it strange that I'm still carrying around the factoid that KPMG once threatened to crush a blogger for linking to its terrible corporate anthem, but that's just my "Memex Method," which helps me keep track of literally everything that seemed important to me through most of my adult life: https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/09/the-memex-method/ One of my favorite quips from the very quotable Riley Quinn is that "leftists are cursed with object-permanence" &#8211; that is, we actually remember what just happened and use it to think about what's happening now. The Memex Method is object permanence for 20+ years worth of stuff. A lot of those deep archives never see use, but there's a surprising number of leading indicators buried in the stuff that happened in years gone by. Take James Boyle's 2014, XKCD-style comic about the experience of driving a notional Apple car: https://www.thepublicdomain.org/2014/11/07/apple-updates-a-comic/ Apple, it turns out, spent the next decade working on just such a car, and while that car has now been canceled, Boyle's comic correctly anticipates so much about the trajectory Apple's products took. It's uncannily accurate &#8211; real "don't invent the torment nexus"/"cyberpunk was a warning, not a suggestion" stuff: https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/torment-nexus But no matter how many times we insist that the torment nexus shouldn't be created, the boardrooms of end-stage capitalism continue to invent them. Take HP, the poster-child for enshittification, edging out even KPMG in the race to turn everything into a pile of shit. After years of tormenting people to punish them for wanting to print things, HP has announced a new service that so mustache-twirlingly evil that it lacks verisimilitude: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/hp-wants-you-to-pay-up-to-36-month-to-rent-a-printer-that-it-monitors/ Here's the pitch: HP will sell you a printer that you don't own. In addition to paying a monthly fee for your ink &#8211; which you pay no matter whether you print or not &#8211; you will also pay a monthly fee just for having HP's printer on your premises. You are absolutely, positively forbidden from using third-party ink in this printer, and must use HP's own ink, which sells for about $10,000/gallon. But while you aren't allowed to use this printer in ways that are bad for HP's shareholders, HP is absolutely free to use the printer in ways that are bad for you. When you click through the signup agreement, you grand HP permission to surveil every document you print &#8211; and your home wifi network more generally &#8211; and to sell that data to anyone and everyone. What's more, HP reserves the right to discipline you with punitive credit-card charges if you disconnect this printer from the internet, on the basis that doing so makes it harder for them to spy on your printer. I'm sorry, this is just more torment nexus shit, the kind of thing you'd expect to drop on Apr 1, not Feb 29, but I guess this is where we are. I can only conjecture as to whether HP's businesses strategists are directly taking direction from my novella "Unauthorized Bread," or whether they're learning about it second-hand from a KPMG consultant who converted it to Powerpoint form and charged $1,500/day for the work: https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/unauthorized-bread-a-near-future-tale-of-refugees-and-sinister-iot-appliances/ All of this cartoonish villainry is the totally foreseeable consequence of a culture of impunity, in which companies like HP and KPMG can rob, cheat, steal (and sometimes even kill) without consequence. This impunity is so pervasive that the exceptions &#8211; where a rich criminal faces real consequences &#8211; become touchstones: Enron, Arthur Anderson, Theranos, and, of course, FTX. FTX was arguably the largest-scale corporate crime in world history, stealing more than $10 billion dollars, mostly from rubes sucked in by hype and Superbowl ads. When news that FTX founder and owner Sam Bankman-Fried was convicted of fraud and was in for a lengthy prison sentence made a huge stir, because criminals like SBF usually walk away from the wreckage with their hands in their pockets, whistling a jaunty tune. One of the very best commentators on cryptocurrency scams generally and FTX/SBF in particular is Molly White, whose Web3 is Going Just Great feed is utterly indispensable. White's newsletter, "Citation Needed," dives deep into the wrangle of SBF's sentencing: https://www.citationneeded.news/issue-52/ Bankman-Fried's parents &#8211; prominent law professors at top law schools &#8211; helped brief the court this week on their son's punishment. According to them, SBF faces 100 years in prison, but should be sentenced to 5.5-6.5 years at the most. Why? Because he is a vegan, who is not greedy, and feels remorse, and cares for individuals (recall that SBF presented himself as the avatar of the batshit "effective altruism" philosophy while privately admitting that he used this as a smokescreen). The most bizarre note in the 100-page filing is SBF's mother declaring that her son is an "angel of mercy," apparently unaware of the grisly meaning of that term: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_of_mercy_(criminology) America's prisons are a travesty and I wouldn't wish them on anyone, but that's not the argument SBF's parents are making; rather, they're arguing that their special boy doesn't deserve the treatment America metes out to poorer, less white people who merely steal hundreds or thousands of dollars. A crook who steals ten billion should be handled the way a casino handles a whale &#8211; with concierge service. The problem is, there are so many of these remorseless, relentless crooks that there's no way we could scale up that white-glove treatment when we finally round 'em all up and make them pay. Writing for The American Prospect, Maureen Tkacik tells us about the ransomware attack that shut down America's pharmacy system last month: https://prospect.org/health/2024-03-01-zoomer-hackers-shut-down-unitedhealthcare/ The attack brought down Change Healthcare, part of the monopolist Unitedhealth, which serves as the "pharmacy benefit manager" to a vast swathe of American pharmacies. PBM is one of those all-American finance scams, a middleman garlanded with performative complexity put there to make you feel stupid for asking why independent pharmacies all have to pay rent to this malicious, unaccountable &#8211; and now, manifestly incompetent &#8211; gang of crooks. Tkacik's breakdown of this scam &#8211; and how it rendered Americans' ability to get the drugs they depend on to go on breathing &#8211; is characteristically brilliant. Tcacik is fast emerging as my favorite Explainer of Scams, a print version of John Oliver or Adam Conover. You may recall her work from my post last week on how private equity has taken a wrecking ball to America's hospitals: https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/28/5000-bats/#charnel-house I always try to finish these linkdumps with some upbeat news to carry you through the weekend, and this week brought two genuinely wonderful &#8211; and totally underreported &#8211; pieces of amazing news. The first is that Starbucks has sued for peace in the war against its workers' unions. Hundreds of Starbucks stores have unionized in recent years, but not one of them had a contract. Instead, Starbucks had waged dirty war on their own workers, from denying gender-affirming care to unionized employees to simply shutting down whole stores after they voted to unionize: https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/14/starbucks-union-company-threatens-that-unionizing-could-jeopardize-gender-affirming-health-care.html But the workers held fast and after years of this, Starbucks has caved, promising contracts for all unionized stores and an end to its campaign of terror against workers seeking to unionize more of its stores. In a postmortem for Jacobin, Eric Blanc rounds up "seven lessons from Starbucks workers' historic victory": https://jacobin.com/2024/02/starbucks-sbwu-contract-bargaining/ This is the kind of listicle I can get behind. According to Blanc, the Starbucks unions won by deploying worker-to-worker organizing, a tactic that many of the new unions that are shaking up formerly impossible-to-organize jobsites are using (Blanc has a book about this coming from UC Press called "We Are the Union: How Worker-to-Worker Unionism Can Transform America," so he should know). Other tactics that made the difference for Starbucks unions: new digital training and support tools and partnering with established unions for support and infrastructure. Blanc also calls out the success of "salting" &#8211; the venerable but largely disused tactic of union organizers applying for a job at a non-union shop in order to organize it. Blanc also mentions government policy, including the outstanding work of NLRB general counsel Jennifer Abruzzo, a shrewd and committed tactician whose understanding of the technicalities of labor law have let her push for bold measures. For example, in Thrive Pet Care, Abruzzo is arguing that when a company refuses to bargain in good faith for a contract with its union, she can step in and order them to honor the terms of a contract at comparable unionized competitors until they produce a contract of their own: https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/06/goons-ginks-and-company-finks/#if-blood-be-the-price-of-your-cursed-wealth Abruzzo is one of several smart, competent tacticians in the Biden administration who are working to kneecap corporate power. Another is Rohit Chopra, chair of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, who just announced another bold, important initiative that will help Americans fight corporate corruption and get a fair deal: https://prospect.org/economy/2024-03-01-public-option-credit-card-shopping/ Chopra is taking aim at credit-card comparison sites that purport to show you where you can get the best deal. If you're an affluent person who doesn't carry a balance, this might not matter to you, but if you're an average working stiff, high interest rates can gobble up a massive share of your paycheck. What's more, credit card margins are higher than they have ever been: https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/credit-card-interest-rate-margins-at-all-time-high/ The most expensive credit cards come from the big, monopolistic banks, but you wouldn't know it from the leaderboards produced by Credit Karma, NerdWallet, LendingTree, and Bankrate. All of these sites take bribes from the big banks to list their credit cards above those offered by credit unions &#8211; who are typically 10% cheaper than the big banks' cards. The new CFPB rule prohibits this fraudulent ranking, but the Bureau is going even further. They're using their administrative powers to force banks to report their rates to the Bureau, which will publish them on a publicly funded, neutral website &#8211; what David Dayen calls "a public option" for shopping for credit cards. This policy makes a perfect bookend to the last CFPB initiative I wrote about here: a rule that forces banks to allow you to transfer your account to a rival with a couple of simple clicks, importing all your history, payees, and everything else you need to switch to a better bank: https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/21/let-my-dollars-go/#personal-financial-data-rights Combine that ease of switching with reliable information on which banks will give you the best deal and you get something that will directly transfer millions and millions of dollars from giant, wildly profitable banks to low-income people who've been tricked into paying them punitive interest rates. So that's it, this week's linkdump. I promised you I'd end on a high note, and I did it. The world may be full of all kinds of terrible things, but workers and regulators are scoring big, muscular victories in battles where the stakes are real and important. Have a great weekend &#8211; we've earned it. And remember! The time is now to lead the way, We share the same the idea That may win by the end of the day. Our strength is here to stay. Identity, one energy, One strategy, with sympathy. These are the words that will lead us into a new world.

## US Lawmakers Demand Probe Into Pakistan Election-Rigging Allegations

date: 2024-03-02, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Thirty-one members of the U.S. Congress recently signed a letter to President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken urging them to not recognize a new government in Pakistan until an investigation into allegations of election interference has been conducted. Voters in Pakistan went to polls on February 8.


On election day, mobile services were blocked by Pakistani authorities and there were cases of violence. Many political leaders and activists were arrested in the weeks before the elections. There was an unusual delay in issuing the election results. All these things led to accusations that the vote was rigged.


VOA Urdu Service reporter Iram Abbasi interviewed U.S. Representative Greg Casar, a Texas Democrat, who wrote the letter to Biden.


The following transcript has been edited for clarity and brevity.


VOA: What are the three demands put forward to the White House and State Department in your letter?


U.S. Representative Greg Casar: I've led a group of over 30 members of Congress asking the United States and the White House to, one, withhold recognition of the folks that say they won the Pakistani election until an independent investigation is completed, showing that the election was not rigged.


Second, we are urging the release of any of those wrongfully detained for engaging in political free speech or just political activity, because people should be able to be journalists, to be able to be candidates, to be able to be political activists without fear of detention or violence against them.


And lastly, we want to make it very clear that the United States security assistance to the military in Pakistan and, frankly, to the military anywhere in the world, is contingent on following strong human rights standards.


 




VOA: What motivated you to lead a group of 31 lawmakers to write this letter to the president and Secretary Blinken?


Casar: If we believe in democracy [in] the United States, then we should believe in democracy everywhere, especially when it comes to our allies.


I, myself, have long studied how the United States suppressed democracy in Latin America. Far too often in Latin America, the United States supposedly was leading on democracy but instead let oligarchs, let large corporations, and let military interests override the will of the people.


And so, the United States supported coups, supported military governments and suppressed democracy in Latin America. And that ultimately hurt, not just Latin Americans, but also hurt people in the United States. It did not work. It did not work economically. It did not work for our safety. The same should apply with [the] United States and Pakistan. We should not simply let geopolitics or corporations or our military alliance override our core value of democracy.


VOA: You've just said that the U.S. has supported coups around the world. Some would argue that with this letter, you might be asking the U.S. to meddle in the internal politics of Pakistan.


Casar: We are not meddling in those internal politics. In fact, the question is whether or not there was a free and fair election. So, our interest is not whether one group or another group wins an election. The people of Pakistan should be able to decide their own election. ... We have very clear laws that aid is contingent on human rights being respected, free speech being respected. We do not want the United States taxpayer dollars to go to militaries that then use that money to incarcerate journalists or suppress free speech or suppress political parties.


VOA: I've spoken to the State Department about this previously because these efforts have been made in the past as well. And their stance is that they want the people of Pakistan to decide who their leader should be. What would you say to that?


Casar: I agree that they should have that ... we should not meddle in domestic politics and that whoever the people of Pakistan want to be elected by majority vote, that's who should be elected. So, the question is, did that happen? And there is extensive video evidence, extensive testimony. And in fact, the State Department knows that there are very credible allegations that are on video, of things happening before the election and allegations after the election that are very concerning to the United States, but are also very concerning, even more concerning, to the people of Pakistan. So, I am not saying that we should withhold recognition of a government for no reason. We should only make sure that the will of the people of Pakistan is heard.


VOA: What do you think you would be able to achieve with this letter if the State Department has received such requests in the past? As you said, there are examples of how journalists are being put in jail and how there are several voices in Pakistan who are saying that elections are allegedly rigged. The government denies that. But what do you think you'll be able to achieve out of it?


Casar: I think if there is an independent and credible investigation into these allegations and it is determined that the elections either were significantly rigged or were not, but the United States and a coalition of nations stands behind whatever the investigation finds — that will be very powerful and very important on the world stage and hopefully will help us get to a more stable and secure and democratic Pakistan, which is good for the entire world, because, as you know, this is a country of over 200 million people. This isn't a small thing for the world.


VOA: In your letter, there is this notion that there was pre-poll rigging, along with the allegations of election rigging. Your letter seems to include that sentiment toward former Prime Minister Imran Khan, as though he was put in jail for the wrong reasons, or he had not been given a fair trial?


Casar: I believe that everyone deserves a fair trial, and it is so important for him [to receive a fair trial]. ... The people of Pakistan want to be able to recognize this and know that their elections are fair and that their leadership was chosen fairly. And so, I think a fair trial for him is important. It's important for everyone, but it is important, of course, for those political leaders. Again, I have no interest in whether he or anyone else leads Pakistan. That is not our interest in the United States. Pakistan should be able to determine its own domestic politics.

## Tesla’s Superchargers Just Got a Whole Lot Busier

date: 2024-03-02, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTYxOTAwMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0OTk0MzcwMH0.hpXSL3M08TidKeyQJ0s2WHb7rzuuuj98zdImmuxaptc/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">It’s a strange sight: Ford F-150 Lightning trucks and Mustang Mach-E crossovers lined up at a Tesla Supercharger, plugged into the familiar red-and-white posts. After years of driving a Model 3, and greeting only other Teslas at our charging stops, I can’t quite get used to the visual. Yet I must, because a new phase of EV charging has arrived.</p>
<p>In the year-plus since Tesla transformed its proprietary plug into an open standard and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/11/23453587/tesla-connector-north-american-standard-ccs-combo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">invited</a> the other automakers to adopt it, they did. <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/guides-and-gear/which-cars-nacs-charge-plugs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Company after company</a> pledged to adopt the renamed North American Charging Standard (which has since been given the technical name <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/02/ford-evs-gain-access-to-tesla-superchargers-starting-today/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">J3400</a>) over the tech they’d been using, which would allow their EV customers to use Tesla’s bigger and more reliable network of fast chargers. </p>
<p>This week, Ford, the first company to go all-in with Tesla’s plug, gained access to the Supercharger network. Around 15,000 Tesla chargers will be compatible with Ford EVs and will show up as part of the BlueOval charging network that appears in the cars’ infotainment screens. The Detroit giant is helping out its early adopters by offering free adapters that would normally cost more than $200, at least for now. (Future Fords will be built with the NACS plug and require no dongle). With many more brands to follow Ford’s lead, we’re about to see Supercharger access change America’s charging dynamic in several ways.</p>
<p>For one thing, buying a non-Tesla EV just got more appealing. Loren McDonald, CEO of the analyst website <a href="https://evadoption.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EVAdoption</a>, says horror stories about busted third-party chargers or the lack of sufficient plugs have dissuaded many on-the-fence drivers from going electric. When he asked his own brother-in-law, who wasn’t a total stranger to electrics, about switching to an EV, the reply was: <em>So if I take that road trip across Idaho, I've heard there's no place to charge. And what if I run out of battery? </em>“I think that was really eye-opening for me,” he says.</p>
<p>Tesla, meanwhile, has held a sales <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-ford-supercharger-network" target="_blank">advantage</a> thanks to the closed access of Superchargers. Lots of buyers, myself included, bought a Tesla over another EV <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/events/7166462372671422465/comments/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">because</a> its network was vast, fast, and reliable, which made it possible to drive an electric vehicle as the primary or only car. Once Ford EVs (or <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/02/29/rivian-confirms-tesla-supercharger-access-in-march/" target="_blank">Rivians</a>, or <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/12/18/gm-ford-ev-owners-tesla-supercharger-access-february/" target="_blank">Chevys</a>, or <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/689976/hyundai-use-tesla-nacs-connector-us-starting-2024/" target="_blank">Hyundais</a>) can use the Tesla network, too, those cars suddenly become more viable options. Just look at Tesla’s updated <a href="https://www.tesla.com/findus?v=2&bounds=47.663879927993605%2C-82.04004025%2C25.20291594072783%2C-143.2558605625&zoom=5&filters=nacs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website</a> and check out all the Supercharger locations suddenly open to other cars with NACS plugs.</p>
<p>It might be annoying for Tesla drivers like me to give up our exclusivity; I’m sure I’ll mutter under my breath the first time I <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/charging-rules-etiquette-manners-queue-plugs" target="_blank">wait</a> for an F-150 to finish charging. But it’s certainly good for electrification at large if expanded plug access gives more people the confidence to go electric.</p>
<p>Tesla, of course, isn’t opening its network out of the goodness of its heart. Even as the company loses its dominant market share in EVs, its triumph in the charging standard wars means that Elon Musk’s company gains new customers who’ll be paying Tesla for electricity. Ford sold more than 70,000 EVs in 2023, for example, all of whom became potential Supercharger users this week. With NACS having succeeded in becoming the industry standard, we’re talking about millions of vehicles around the world ready to buy Tesla’s power. </p>
<p>Those new customers might be paying extra, too. <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/02/29/business-behind-tesla-opening-supercharger-network-selling-memberships/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Electrek</em></a> reports that Tesla is charging Ford drivers a 30% premium per kilowatt hour. Ford owners can get around that fee by purchasing a $12.99 per month Supercharger subscription that would see them pay the same kWh price as Tesla drivers. Of course, that model incentivizes those drivers to subscribe indefinitely and to maximize their investment by choosing Superchargers as often as possible.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the new charging paradigm could benefit those who don’t care to pay for yet another subscription. Ford’s electric drivers could get along just fine by doing nearly all their charging at home or at stations run by Electrify America or EVgo. Then, if they need a little juice somewhere with only a Tesla supercharger, they could pay a premium and be on their way.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Tesla’s new power in the charging market means it could go the other direction, too — say, by starting a price war like it did in the EV market, which kneecapped the profitability of EV efforts by traditional carmakers like Ford. Once again, it’s Tesla’s competitors who might be in trouble. </p>

## Apple walks back decision to disable home screen web apps in the EU

date: 2024-03-02, from: OS News

Following the release of the second beta version of iOS 17.4, it emerged that Apple had restricted the functionality of iOS web apps in the EU. Web apps could no longer launch from the ‌Home Screen‌ in their own top-level window that takes up the entire screen, relegating them to a simple shortcut with an option to open within Safari instead. The move was heavily criticized by groups like Open Web Advocacy, which started a petition in an effort to persuade Apple to reverse the change, and it even caught the attention of the European Commission. Now, Apple has backtracked and says that ‌Home Screen‌ web apps that use WebKit in the EU will continue to function as expected upon the release of iOS 17.4. ↫ Hartley Charlton at MacRumors A welcome move, but they will still be restricted to opening using WebKit instead of any other engine Europeans will be allowed to install. With criticism of Apple&#8217;s DMA plans mounting, and pressure on the European Commission to not approve Apple&#8217;s plans increasing, all of this might change over the coming months, still.

## Apple silicon: a little help from friends and co-processors

date: 2024-03-02, from: OS News

So far in this series, I have looked in broad terms at how the CPU cores in Apple silicon chips work, and how they use frequency control and two types of core to deliver high performance with low power and energy use. As I hinted previously, their design also relies on specialist processing units and co-processors, the subject of this article. ↫ Howard Oakley Another excellent read from Howard Oakley.

## Why I use Firefox

date: 2024-03-02, from: OS News

Questions like “Which browser should I use?” regularly come up on the r/browsers subreddit. I sometimes respond to these posts, but my quick replies usually only contain one or two points. To be honest, until recently I wasn’t even sure myself why I use Firefox. Of course it’s a pretty good browser, but that doesn’t explain why I’ve stubbornly stayed loyal to Firefox for more than a decade. After giving it a bit more thought, I came up with the following reasons. ↫ Šime Vidas There&#8217;s really no viable alternative to Firefox for me. I wish we had more choice, more competition, and more vibrancy in the browser space, and I&#8217;m definitely anxious about the future of Firefox, but with every other browser being either Chrome, possibly with skin, or Safari, there&#8217;s really nowhere else to go.

## The GOP returns to its bad old self

date: 2024-03-02, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>I&#8217;ve recently been reading about Warren Buffett&#8217;s father, Howard Buffett, a four-term Republican congressman from Nebraska. He seems to have been a very good father, but his political worldview was predicated on a deep pessimism. He was so convinced that federal spending was ruining the country that he bought a farm so that his family could feed itself while everyone else starved. He predicted that all government bonds would soon be worthless and bought his daughters gold jewelry so that they would have something of value after the dollar became worthless.</p>

## March 1, 2024 

date: 2024-03-02, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

Today, President Joe Biden signed the continuing resolution that will give lawmakers another week to finalize appropriations bills. Lawmakers will continue to hash out the legislation that will fund the government. Republicans have been stalling the appropriations bills for months. In addition to inserting their own extremist cultural demands in the measures, they have demanded budget cuts to address the fact that the government spends far more money than it brings in.
