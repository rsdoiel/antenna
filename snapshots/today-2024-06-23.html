id="inside-out-2-scores-100m-in-its-2nd-weekend-setting-records">‘Inside
Out 2’ scores $100M in its 2nd weekend, setting records</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Weekend number two was just as joyous for “Inside Out
2.” </p>
<p>The Pixar sequel collected $100 million in ticket sales in its second
weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday, setting a record for an
animated movie in its follow-up frame in theaters. The previous best
second weekend for an animated title was the $92 million for “The Super
Mario Bros. Movie.” Only six movies ever have had better second
weekends.</p>
<p>In just a week and a half, “Inside Out 2” has become 2024’s
highest-grossing film to date with $724.4 million globally, including
$355.2 million in U.S. and Canadian theaters. That passes the $711.8
million worldwide total of “Dune: Part Two.” “Inside Out 2” will likely
blow through the $1 billion mark in about a week, which would make it
the first film since “Barbie” to do so.</p>
<p>The extent of the “Inside Out 2” success startled Hollywood, which
had grown accustomed to lower expectations as the film industry watched
ticket sales this year slump about 40% below pre-pandemic totals,
according to data firm Comscore, before “Inside Out 2” came along.</p>
<p>The record haul for “Inside Out 2,” though, recalled past years when
$1 billion grosses were more commonplace for the Walt Disney Co. It is
also a much-needed blockbuster for Pixar, which after experimenting with
direct-to-streaming releases, reconsidered its movie pipeline and
approach to mass-audience appeal.</p>
<p>Now, “Inside Out 2,” which dipped a mere 35% from its $154 million
domestic debut, is poised to challenge “The Incredibles 2” ($1.2
billion) for the all-time top grossing Pixar release. It could also
steer the venerated animation factory toward more sequels. Among its
upcoming films is “Toy Story 5,” due out in 2026.</p>
<p>For theater owners, “Inside Out 2” could hardly have been more
needed. But it also reminded exhibitors of how feast-or-famine the movie
business has become in recent years. Since the pandemic, movies like
“Barbie,” “Spider-Man: No Way Home” and “Top Gun: Maverick” have pushed
ticket sales to record heights, but fallow periods in between box-office
sensations have grown longer. Ticket sales over Memorial Day last month
were the worst in three decades.</p>
<p>Some of 2024’s downturn can be attributed to release-schedule
juggling caused by last year’s writers and actors strikes. The biggest
new release over the weekend was Jeff Nichols’ motorcycle gang drama
“The Bikeriders,” a film originally slated to open in 2023 before the
actors’ strike prompted its postponement.</p>
<p>“The Bikeriders,” starring Jodie Comer, Austin Butler and Tom Hardy,
came in on the high side of expectations with $10 million from 2,642
venues in its opening weekend. “The Bikeriders,” which cost about $35
million to produce, was originally to be released by Disney before New
Regency took it to Focus Features last fall.</p>
<p>The strong business for “Inside Out 2” appeared to raise ticket sales
generally. Sony Pictures’ “Bad Boys: Ride or Die” held well in its third
week of release, collecting $18.8 million. It remained in second place.
The “Bad Boys” sequel, starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, has
grossed $146.9 million domestically thus far.</p>
<p>Next week, the sci-fi horror prequel “A Quiet Place: Day One” and
Kevin Costner’s Western epic “Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1”
will hope some of the “Inside Out 2” success rubs off on them.</p>
<p>Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian
theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released
Monday. </p>

<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;With great timing, a post by Nicolas titled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://thejollyteapot.com/2024/06/23/should-i-remove-this-blog-from-google-search&quot;&gt;Should I remove this blog from Google Search?&lt;/a&gt;” landed in my RSS feed earlier today. I’ve been thinking a lot about the current phase the web is going through, especially after reading all the various news related to Perplexity AI. I don’t think they’re especially bad or wrong in what they’re doing, I’m sure the other companies are equally as bad and they’re also not giving half of a fuck about ingesting whatever they can find if it helps make their products better. They don’t care about book authors, they don’t care about journalists and they for sure don’t care about small personal bloggers.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
That brings up the question: what do we do? What even can we do? It’s
obvious that robots.txt is no longer an option because most companies
don’t even bother checking it. We can try to block the user agents at a
server level but they can avoid that by simply sending a generic UA. We
could de-list our sites but that would make it very hard for actual
users to find our content and I suspect the point of writing for most of
us is to share and connect with others. The legal system sure ain’t
gonna fix this situation anytime soon. So what’s left? I guess there are
only two options left:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Accept the fact that some dickheads will do whatever they want because
that’s just the world we live in
</li>
<li>
Make everything private and only allow actual human beings access to our
content
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Both solutions are suboptimal. Reading Nicolas’s post made me also think
about something else. He wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In the case of Perplexity for example, a company that obviously steals
content, lies, doesn’t really credit its sources, and — on top of it
all — ignores the robots.txt rules from websites. If I were the
TechCrunch, the New York Times, and the Financial Times of the world, I
would simply stop reporting on the company. Not a blip on the radar,
radio silence, except for their next fuck up. And then good luck finding
investors if no one talks about you. They had their chance, they blew
it.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
What if Google decided to do that? What if Google decided to not return
any result related to a company like Perplexity? I know it’s obviously
not going to happen but wouldn’t that be funny?

id="democrats-wrestle-with-whether-to-attend-netanyahus-address-to-congress">Democrats
wrestle with whether to attend Netanyahu’s address to Congress</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The last time Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
addressed the U.S. Congress, nearly 60 Democrats skipped his speech nine
years ago, calling it a slap in the face to then-President Barack Obama
as he negotiated a nuclear deal with Iran.</p>
<p>With Netanyahu scheduled to address U.S. lawmakers on July 24 and his
government now at war with Hamas in Gaza, the number of absences is
likely to be far greater.</p>
<p>Congressional Democrats are wrestling with whether to attend. Many
are torn between their long-standing support for Israel and their
anguish about the way Israel has conducted military operations in Gaza.
More than 37,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since the
Hamas attack on Oct. 7 that triggered the war, according to the Health
Ministry in Hamas-run territory. The ministry does not differentiate
between civilians and combatants in its figures.</p>
<p>While some Democrats are saying they will come out of respect for
Israel, a larger and growing faction wants no part of it, creating an
extraordinarily charged atmosphere at a gathering that normally amounts
to a ceremonial, bipartisan show of support for an American ally.</p>
<p>“I wish that he would be a statesman and do what is right for Israel.
We all love Israel,” former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said
recently on CNN about Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Tensions between Netanyahu and Democratic President Joe Biden have
been seeping into the public, with Netanyahu last week accusing the
Biden administration of withholding U.S. weapons from Israel — a claim
he made again Sunday to his Cabinet. After the prime minister leveled
the charge the first time, White House press secretary Karine
Jean-Pierre said, “We genuinely do not know what he’s talking about. We
just don’t.”</p>
<p>The invitation from House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to Netanyahu
came after consultation with the White House, according to a person
familiar with the matter who was granted anonymity to discuss the
sensitive subject. As of now, no meeting between the leaders during
Netanyahu’s Washington visit has been scheduled, this person said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said in a release that he was “very moved” by the
invitation to address Congress and the chance “to present the truth
about our just war against those who seek to destroy us to the
representatives of the American people and the entire world.”</p>
<p>Republicans first floated the idea in March of inviting Netanyahu
after Sen. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the highest-ranking Jewish
official in the United States, gave a speech on the Senate floor that
was harshly critical of the prime minister. Schumer, D-N.Y., called the
Israeli leader “an obstacle to peace” and urged new elections in Israel,
even as he denounced Hamas and criticized Palestinian Authority
President Mahmoud Abbas.</p>
<p>Republicans denounced the speech as an affront to Israel and its
sovereignty. Johnson spoke of asking Netanyahu to come to Washington, an
invitation that Schumer and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of
New York ultimately endorsed, albeit reluctantly. Pelosi, who opposed
the invitation to Netanyahu in 2015 when she was Democratic leader, said
it was a mistake for the congressional leadership to extend it again
this time.</p>
<p>Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who attended the 2015
address as a House member, said he saw no reason why Congress “should
extend a political lifeline” to Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee,
said it would be “healthy” for members of both parties to attend. “I
think that a lot of Americans are getting a one-sided narrative,
especially the younger generation, and I think it’s important they hear
from the prime minister of Israel, in terms of his perspective,” said
McCaul, R-Texas.</p>
<p>Interviews with more than a dozen Democrats revealed the breadth of
discontent over the coming address, which many feel is a Republican ploy
intended to divide their party. Some Democrats say they will attend to
express their support for Israel, not Netanyahu.</p>
<p>New York Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, said he has an “obligation” to attend because of that
position.</p>
<p>Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., who leads the Sente Foreign Relations
Committee, has signaled he will be there. Cardin said that what he’s
looking for in Netanyahu’s speech is a “type of message that can
strengthen the support in this country for Israel’s needs,” but also lay
the groundwork for peace in the region.</p>
<p>Other Democrats are waiting to see whether Netanyahu will still be
prime minister by the time he is supposed to speak to Congress.</p>
<p>There have been open signs of discontent over the handling of the war
by Netanyahu’s government, a coalition that includes right-wing
hard-liners who oppose any kind of settlement with Hamas.</p>
<p>Benny Gantz, a former military chief and centrist politician,
withdrew from Netanyahu’s war Cabinet this month, citing frustration
over the prime minister’s conduct of the war. On Monday, Netanyahu
dissolved that body.</p>
<p>Rep. Seth Magaziner, D-R.I., said he stands with those “who hope that
he’s not prime minister by the time late July rolls around. I think that
he has been bad for Israel, bad for Palestinians, bad for America.” But,
he added, he believes it his job to show up when a head of state
addresses Congress, “even if its someone who I have concerns about and
disagree with.”</p>
<p>Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., attended the 2015 speech and described it as
“among the most painful hours” he has spent while in Congress. He plans
to boycott unless Netanyahu became a “champion for a cease-fire.”</p>
<p>A large portion of the Congressional Progressive Caucus — lawmakers
who are among the most critical of Israel’s handling of the war — is
expected to skip. Among them is Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the
chair of the caucus, who told The Associated Press that it was a “bad
idea,” to invite Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Netanyahu’s visit is expected to draw significant protests.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-all-these-alerts-about-ground-level-ozone">What Are All
These Alerts About Ground-Level Ozone?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjQ4MTE2My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0Njk4MjIzNn0.t1ATfNp4EGBfnG68XEWjyzDY-lcLfamjjY7Ea72O6qw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
If you’re of a certain age, you probably remember the hole in the ozone
layer. Like Joseph Kony and Livestrong wristbands, the obsession over O3
now feels like a cultural artifact, thanks to ozone depletion being one
of the rare success stories of international environmental cooperation.
Since the world banned chlorofluorocarbons under the Montreal Protocol
in 1987, the holes over the North and South poles have
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/09/climate/ozone-hole-restoration-montreal-protocol.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>steadily
recovered</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Today, if you hear about “ozone” at all, it’s much more likely to be
from an air quality alert on your phone. Unlike the stratospheric ozone
that we were all so concerned about in the 1980s and 1990s, which makes
up a protective layer around the planet that insulates us from the sun’s
cancer-causing ultraviolet rays, “tropospheric” or “ground-level” ozone
is mainly man-made. In fact, when people throw around the word
“pollution,” what they’re <em><em>probably</em></em> talking about is
ground-level ozone, which is created by a chemical reaction between
nitrogen oxides (highly reactive gases produced by burning fuels) and
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/technical-overview-volatile-organic-compounds" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>volatile
organic compounds</u></a> (organic compounds that easily evaporate under
normal environmental conditions and can be found in vehicle exhaust as
well as scented personal care products like deodorants, lotions, and bug
sprays), plus sunlight. This chemical reaction usually occurs when cars,
refineries, power plants,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/lng-front-line-communities-louisiana" target="_self"><u>and
other industrial sources</u></a> emit pollutants into the environment
during a hot, clear day. You probably know the result by its other name:
smog.
</p>
<p>
Ozone is a climate issue not just because it is yet another concerning
consequence of burning fossil fuels. According to some estimates, high
levels of ground-level ozone pollution could grow in frequency by
<a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/04/the-complex-relationship-between-heat-and-ozone/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>three
to nine additional days per year</u></a> by 2050 because of the gas’s
close relationship with intense sunlight and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/is-extreme-weather-climate-change#:~:text=Heat%20waves%20and%20heat%20domes" target="_self"><u>high
temperatures</u></a>. While ozone dissipates
<a href="https://www.ccacoalition.org/short-lived-climate-pollutants/tropospheric-ozone" target="_blank">fairly
quickly</a> once those conditions go away, it can build up while they
last. Hot days, which are increasing in the U.S., also coincide with
weak winds and stagnant air — conditions that allow ozone to accumulate
in one place.
</p>
<p>
When the temperatures start to rise, here’s what you need to know and
what you can do to protect yourself and others from ozone pollution.
</p>
<h3>
How worried should I be when I get an air quality alert for ground-level
ozone?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
Different pollutants cause concern at different concentrations. The Air
Quality Index is
<a href="https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/" target="_blank"><u>designed</u></a>
so that, in theory, a level of “100” corresponds to the point at which
people in sensitive populations might start to be affected by the
pollutant in question. (To learn more about how the AQI is calculated,
you can read our explainer
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/air-quality-safe" target="_self"><u>here</u></a>).
</p>
<p>
That said, “The evidence has clearly been increasing that lower levels
of ozone — levels well below the current standard of 70 parts per
billion — are causing more health impacts,” Katherine Pruitt, the
national senior director of policy at the American Lung Association,
which is
<a href="https://a.lung.org/a4uvkzw?_ga=2.237242432.1103150728.1718905349-154044302.1718905349&_gl=1*1u6zfom*_gcl_au*MTMyMzU3Nzg5Ni4xNzE4OTA1MzQ5*_ga*MTU0MDQ0MzAyLjE3MTg5MDUzNDk.*_ga_P13PC1PGW8*MTcxODk4ODY4MS4yLjAuMTcxODk4ODY4My41OC4wLjA." target="_blank"><u>campaigning</u></a>
to strengthen the standard to 55 to 60 parts per billion, told me.
</p>
<p>
As Pruitt explained, ozone is a caustic irritant and can
<a href="https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6268026" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>corrode
metals</u></a>. Breathing it in can cause inflammation in anyone, “from
vulnerable children and elders to even the fittest elite athletes,”
Pruitt said, adding that it is, “at some level, like getting a sunburn
on your lungs.” Anyone who spends time outside is vulnerable to ozone,
but the more sensitive groups — including children; the elderly; people
with asthma, chronic heart disease, and other diseases; and pregnant
women — are at a higher risk. They might already be paying more
attention to the AQI levels in their area, and will potentially notice
that they need to slow down and limit exertion during “yellow” or
“orange”-level ozone events.
</p>
<p>
In the short term,
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/ground-level-ozone-pollution/health-effects-ozone-pollution" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ozone
pollution can cause</u></a> coughing, shortness of breath, and a lowered
immune response, on top of aggravating any preexisting lung conditions
or diseases. But Pruitt stressed to me that “living in places that have
high levels of ozone day in and day out, for months and years, can cause
respiratory diseases, nervous system disorders, metabolic disorders,
reproductive problems, and mortality. It’s not just a cough and a wheeze
on one bad air day.”
</p>
<h3>
Where are the worst places in the country for ozone?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
Ozone requires two main ingredients: the burning of fossil fuels and
other chemicals, and sunlight. While ozone concentrations can be high in
communities with a lot of industry and freeways nearby, ozone is “not
really so much a roadway problem; it’s more of what we call an ambient
air pollutant,” Pruitt said. Ozone can travel far away from where it was
produced, in other words.
</p>
<p>
There are some rules of thumb, though. The places with the highest
emissions and most appropriate atmospheric conditions for ozone
pollution are “increasingly the western U.S. and the Southwest,” Pruitt
said. The
<a href="https://www.lung.org/media/press-releases/sota-2024#:~:text=2.4%20million%20fewer%20people%20lived,over%20the%20last%2025%20years." target="_blank"><u>top
four worst cities for ozone</u></a> on the 2024 State of the Air report
by the ALA were all in California, led by Los Angeles and Long Beach.
</p>
<p>
Since the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1963, other regions of the
country have been doing much better, including the Southeast,
mid-Atlantic, and Northeast. (Bangor, Maine, had the cleanest air in the
report.)
</p>
<h3>
What can I do to protect myself?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
Because ozone is so strongly related to sunlight, it does not cause
indoor air pollution
<a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/when-theres-smoke-getting-indoors-isnt-enough" target="_self"><u>to
the same extent as wildfire smoke</u></a><strong> </strong>(which, if
you’re keeping score, is a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/how-many-people-will-this-smoke-kill" target="_self"><u>PM2.5
pollutant</u></a>). “Because it’s so reactive, it gloms onto your
furniture and your walls and stuff, once it gets inside,” Pruitt said of
ozone. To protect yourself, you can just stay indoors and run your air
conditioner.
</p>
<p>
But what if you want or need to go out? Because ozone is a gas rather
than a particle, HEPA filters and face masks won’t protect you. Instead,
Pruitt said that you can time your errands, tend to your garden, and
exercise when the sunlight is the weakest — mornings, especially, tend
to be less demanding on the lungs during ozone events.
</p>
<h3>
What can I do to protect others?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
The Clean Air Act of 1963 requires the Environmental Protection Agency
to review the national ambient air quality standards for ozone (as well
as several other pollutants) every five years. “It almost never actually
does it every five years” though, Pruitt said. “Sometimes advocates have
to sue them to get them to move things along.” The EPA completed its
last review in December 2020, with the Trump administration
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/12/23/trump-smog-rule/" target="_blank"><u>maintaining</u></a>
the 70 parts per billion standard set in 2015. Attacks on the Clean Air
Act would likely
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/epa-rescinds-trump-move-that-changed-how-agency-weighs-costs-benefits-new-rules-2021-05-13/" target="_blank"><u>resume</u></a>
if Trump
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self"><u>retakes
office</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Aside from agitating for stricter clean air standards, there are
measures you can take to protect others from ozone events. The simplest
is not to contribute any more nitrogen oxides and volatile organic
compounds to the environment than you otherwise have to when ozone
levels are high. Avoid driving or idling your car; top off your tank
during <a href="https://www.cabq.gov/ozone" target="_blank"><u>the
coolest parts of the day</u></a>, such as after dark; minimize your
electricity use; and
<a href="https://www3.epa.gov/region1/airquality/reducepollution.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>set
your air conditioner</u></a> no lower than 78 degrees.
</p>
<p>
In the long term, reducing ozone pollution will mean “choosing greener
products for cleaning and personal care, so that we’re not producing
volatile organic compounds,” Pruitt told me. The National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration
<a href="https://research.noaa.gov/2021/08/03/fragrant-consumer-products-a-key-source-of-ozone-forming-pollution-in-new-york-city/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>previously
found</u></a> that in New York City in 2018, “about half” of the ambient
volatile organic compounds it measured were produced by people, not
vehicle exhaust. (Here’s
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/15/well/live/personal-care-products-chemicals.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
guide</u></a> to reducing VOCs from your rotation.)
</p>
<p>
Additionally, “transitioning to zero-emission technologies so we’re not
burning fossil fuels” will help limit ozone pollution, Pruitt said. The
difference can be pretty significant: A study from the University of
Houston published earlier this month found that by
<a href="https://uh.edu/news-events/stories/2024/june/06032024-ev-air-quality-cities.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>switching
to electric vehicles</u></a>, New York and Chicago could prevent 796 and
328 premature pollution-related deaths per month, respectively.
Counterintuitively,
<a href="https://uh.edu/news-events/stories/2024/june/06032024-ev-air-quality-cities.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
study</u></a> found that more EVs on the roads could <em>increase</em>
mortality in Los Angeles due to a corresponding increase in secondary
organic aerosols caused by complicated dynamics between nitrogen oxides
and volatile organic compounds and the city’s unique geography. “This
underscores the need for region-specific environmental regulations,” the
authors said.

may soon return land US stole from Prairie Band Potawatomi chief 175
years ago</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. — Some 175 years after the U.S. government stole
land from the chief of the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation while he was
away visiting relatives, Illinois may soon return it to the tribe.</p>
<p>Nothing ever changed the 1829 treaty that Chief Shab-eh-nay signed
with the U.S. government to preserve for him a reservation in northern
Illinois: not subsequent accords nor the 1830 Indian Removal Act, which
forced all indigenous people to move west of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>But around 1848, the U.S. sold the land to white settlers while
Shab-eh-nay and other members of his tribe were visiting family in
Kansas. </p>
<p>To right the wrong, Illinois would transfer a 1,500-acre
(607-hectare) state park west of Chicago, which was named after
Shab-eh-nay, to the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation. The state would
continue providing maintenance while the tribe says it wants to keep the
park as it is. </p>
<p>“The average citizen shouldn’t know that title has been transferred
to the nation so they can still enjoy everything that’s going on within
the park and take advantage of all of that area out there,” said Joseph
“Zeke” Rupnick, chairman of the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation based in
Mayetta, Kansas.</p>
<p>It’s not entirely the same soil that the U.S. took from Chief
Shab-eh-nay. The boundaries of his original 1,280-acre (518-hectare)
reservation now encompass hundreds of acres of privately owned land, a
golf course and county forest preserve. The legislation awaiting
Illinois House approval would transfer the Shabbona Lake State
Recreation Area.</p>
<p>No one disputes Shab-eh-nay’s reservation was illegally sold and
still belongs to the Potawatomi. An exactingly researched July 2000 memo
from the Interior Department found the claim valid and shot down
rebuttals from Illinois officials at the time, positing, “It appears
that Illinois officials are struggling with the concept of having an
Indian reservation in the state.”</p>
<p>But nothing has changed a quarter-century later.</p>
<p>Democratic state Rep. Will Guzzardi, who sponsored the legislation to
transfer the state park, said it is a significant concession on the part
of the Potawatomi. With various private and public concerns now owning
more than half of the original reservation land, reclaiming it for the
Potawatomi would set up a serpentine legal wrangle.</p>
<p>“Instead, the tribe has offered a compromise, which is to say, ‘We’ll
take the entirety of the park and give up our claim to the private land
and the county land and the rest of that land,’” Guzzardi said. “That’s
a better deal for all parties involved.”</p>
<p>The proposed transfer of the park, which is 68 miles (109 kilometers)
west of Chicago, won Senate approval in the final days of the spring
legislative session. But a snag in the House prevented its passage.
Proponents will seek endorsement of the measure when the Legislature
returns in November for its fall meeting.</p>
<p>The Second Treaty of Prairie du Chien in 1829 guaranteed the original
land to Chief Shab-eh-ney. The tribe signed 20 other treaties during the
next 38 years, according to Rupnick.</p>
<p>“Yet Congress still kept those two sections of land for Chief
Shab-eh-nay and his descendants forever,” said Rupnick, a fourth
great-grandson of Shab-eh-nay. “At any one of those times the Congress
could have removed the status of that land. They never did.”</p>
<p>Key to the proposal is a management agreement between the tribe and
the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. Rupnick said the tribe
needs the state’s help to maintain the park.</p>
<p>Many residents who live next to the park oppose the plan, fearing
construction of a casino or even a hotel would draw more tourists and
lead to a larger, more congested community.</p>
<p>“Myself and my family have put a lot of money and given up a lot to
be where we are in a small community and enjoy the park the way that it
is,” resident Becky Oest told a House committee in May, asking that the
proposal be amended to prohibit construction that would “affect our
community. It’s a small town. We don’t want it to grow bigger.”</p>
<p>Rupnick said a casino doesn’t make sense because state-sanctioned
gambling boats already dot the state. He did not rule out a hotel,
noting the park draws 500,000 visitors a year and the closest lodging is
in DeKalb, 18 miles (29 kilometers) northeast of Shabbona. The park has
150 campsites.</p>
<p>In 2006, the tribe purchased 128 acres (52 hectares) in a corner of
the original reservation and leases the land for farming. The U.S.
government in April certified that as the first reservation in
Illinois.</p>
<p>Guzzardi hopes the Potawatomi don’t have to wait much longer to see
that grow exponentially with the park transfer.</p>
<p>“It keeps this beautiful public asset available to everyone,”
Guzzardi said. “It resolves disputed title for landholders in the area
and most importantly, it fixes a promise that we broke.”</p>

id="abortion-access-has-won-when-its-been-on-the-ballot-but-not-option-for-half-the-states">Abortion
access has won when it’s been on the ballot, but not option for half the
states</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CHARLESTON, W.Va. — Tucked inside the West Virginia Statehouse is a
copy of a petition to lawmakers with a simple request: Let the voters
decide whether to reinstate legal access to abortion.</p>
<p>The request has been ignored by the Republican lawmakers who have
supermajority control in the Legislature and banned abortions in the
state in 2022, shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a
constitutional right to the procedure.</p>
<p>The petition, with more than 2,500 signatures, is essentially
meaningless given the current makeup of the Legislature. But it
illustrates the frustratingly limited options millions of Americans face
in trying to re-establish abortion rights as the country marks the
two-year anniversary since the Supreme Court’s ruling.</p>
<p>West Virginia is among the 25 states that do not allow citizen
initiatives or constitutional amendments on a statewide ballot, an
avenue of direct democracy that has allowed voters to circumvent their
legislatures and preserve abortion and other reproductive rights in a
number of states over the past two years.</p>
<p>Republicans there have repeatedly dismissed the idea of placing an
abortion-rights measure before voters, which in West Virginia is a step
only lawmakers can take.</p>
<p>“It makes you wonder what they’re so afraid of,” said Democratic Del.
Kayla Young, one of only 16 women in the West Virginia Legislature. “If
they feel so strongly that this is what people believe, prove it.”</p>
<p>The court’s ruling to overturn Roe v. Wade was praised by abortion
opponents as a decision that returned the question to the states. Former
President Donald Trump, who named three of the justices who overturned
Roe, has repeatedly claimed “the people” are now the ones deciding
abortion access.</p>
<p>“The people are deciding,” he said during a recent interview with Fox
News host Sean Hannity. “And in many ways, it’s a beautiful thing to
watch.”</p>
<p>But that’s not true everywhere. In states allowing the citizen
initiative and where abortion access has been on the ballot, voters have
resoundingly affirmed the right to abortion.</p>
<p>Voters in seven states, including conservative ones such as Kentucky,
Montana and Ohio, have either protected abortion rights or defeated
attempts to curtail them in statewide votes over the past two years.
Reproductive rights supporters are trying to put citizen initiatives on
the ballot in several states this year.</p>
<p>But voters don’t have a direct say in about half the states.</p>
<p>This is particularly true for those living in the South.
Republican-controlled legislatures, many of which have been heavily
gerrymandered to give the GOP disproportionate power, have enacted some
of the strictest abortion bans since the Supreme Court ruling while
shunning efforts to expand direct democracy.</p>
<p>States began adopting the initiative process during the Progressive
Era more than a century ago, giving citizens a way to make or repeal
laws through a direct vote of the people. Between 1898 and 1918, nearly
20 states approved the citizen initiative. Since then, just five states
have done so.</p>
<p>“It was a different time,” said John Matsusaka, professor of business
and law at the University of Southern California. “There was a political
movement across the whole country when people were trying to do what
they saw as good government.”</p>
<p>Some lawmakers argue citizen initiatives bypass important checks and
balances offered through the legislative process. In Tennessee, where
Republicans have gerrymandered legislative districts to give them a
supermajority in the statehouse, House Majority Leader William Lamberth
likened ballot measures to polls rather than what he described as the
legislature’s strict review of complicated policy-making.</p>
<p>“We evaluate bills every single year,” he said.</p>
<p>As in West Virginia, abortion-rights supporters or Democratic
lawmakers have asked Republican-controlled legislatures in a handful of
states to take the abortion question straight to voters, a tactic that
hasn’t succeeded anywhere the GOP has a majority.</p>
<p>“This means you’re going to say, ‘Hey Legislature, would you like to
give up some of your power? Would you like to give up your monopoly on
policymaking?’” said Thad Kousser, professor of political science at the
University of California, San Diego. “You need a political momentum and
then have the process cooperate.”</p>
<p>In South Carolina, which bans nearly all abortions, a
Democratic-backed resolution to put a state constitutional amendment on
the ballot never got a hearing this year. Attempts to attach the
proposal to other pieces of legislation were quickly shut down by
Republicans.</p>
<p>“If you believe you are doing the right thing for all the people of
South Carolina — men and women and babies — you should have no problem
putting this to the people,” said Democratic Sen. Margie Bright
Matthews, alleging that Republicans fear they would lose if the issue
went directly to voters.</p>
<p>In Georgia, Democratic Rep. Shea Roberts said she frequently fields
questions from her constituents asking how they can get involved in a
citizen-led ballot measure. The interest exploded after voters in Kansas
rejected an anti-abortion measure from the Legislature in 2022 and was
rekindled last fall after Ohio voters overwhelmingly passed an amendment
codifying abortion rights in the state’s constitution.</p>
<p>Yet when she has brought legislation to create a citizen initiative
process in Georgia, the efforts have been ignored inside the
Republican-controlled Legislature.</p>
<p>“Voters are constantly asking us why we can’t do this, and we’re
constantly explaining that it’s not possible under our current
constitution,” Roberts said. “If almost half of states have this
process, why shouldn’t Georgians?”</p>
<p>The contrast is on stark display in two presidential swing states.
Michigan voters used a citizen initiative to enshrine abortion rights in
their state constitution in 2022. Voters in neighboring Wisconsin don’t
have that ability.</p>
<p>Instead, Wisconsin Democrats, with a new liberal majority on the
state Supreme Court, are working to overturn Republican-drawn
legislative maps that are among the most gerrymandered in the country in
the hope of eventually flipping the Legislature.</p>
<p>Analiese Eicher, director of communications at Planned Parenthood
Advocates of Wisconsin, said a citizen-led ballot measure process would
have been especially valuable for her cause.</p>
<p>“We should have legislators who represent their constituents,” she
said. “And if they don’t, there should be another option.”</p>
<p>In West Virginia, Steve Williams acknowledges the petition he
spearheaded didn’t change minds inside the Legislature.</p>
<p>But the Democratic mayor of Huntington, who is a longshot candidate
for governor, said he thinks state Republicans have underestimated how
strongly voters believe in restoring some kind of abortion access.  </p>
<p>Republican leadership has pointed to a 2018 vote in which just under
52% of voters supported a constitutional amendment saying there is no
right to abortion access in the state. But Williams said the vote also
had to do with state funding of abortion, which someone could oppose

<h2 id="israel-defense-chief-to-discuss-gaza-lebanon-on-us-trip">Israel
defense chief to discuss Gaza, Lebanon on US trip</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Jerusalem — Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant headed to
Washington on Sunday to discuss the next phase of the Gaza war and
escalating hostilities on the border with Lebanon, where exchanges of
fire with Hezbollah have stoked fears of wider conflict.</p>
<p>Iran-backed Hezbollah has been trading fire with Israel since the
Gaza war erupted more than eight months ago. The group has said it will
not stop until there is a ceasefire in Gaza.</p>
<p>“We are prepared for any action that may be required in Gaza,
Lebanon, and in more areas,” Gallant said in a statement before setting
off to Washington, where he said he will meet his counterpart Lloyd
Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.</p>
<p>Earlier in June, Hezbollah targeted Israeli towns and military sites
with the largest volleys of rockets and drones in the hostilities so
far, after an Israeli strike killed the most senior Hezbollah commander
yet.</p>
<p>U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein visited Israel and Lebanon last week in an
attempt to cool tensions, amid an uptick in cross-border fire and an
escalation in rhetoric on both sides.</p>
<p>Some Israeli officials have linked the ongoing Israeli push into
Rafah, the southern area of Gaza where it says it is targeting the last
battalions of militant Islamist group Hamas, to a potential focus on
Lebanon.</p>
<p>Gallant appeared to make the same link in his statement.</p>
<p>“The transition to Phase C in Gaza is of great importance. I will
discuss this transition with U.S. officials, how it may enable
additional things and I know that we will achieve close cooperation with
the U.S. on this issue as well,” Gallant said.</p>
<p>Scaling back Gaza operations would free up forces to take on
Hezbollah, were Israel to launch a ground offensive or step up its
aerial bombardments.</p>
<p>Officials have described the third and last phase of Israel’s Gaza
offensive as winding down fighting while stepping up efforts to
stabilize a post-Hamas rule and begin reconstruction in the enclave,
much of which has been laid to waste.</p>
<p>Gallant, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party,
has sparred with the premier in the past few months, calling for a
clearer post-war plan for Gaza that will not leave Israel in charge, a
demand echoed by the White House.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has been walking a tightrope as he seeks to keep his
government together by balancing the demands of the defence
establishment, including ex-generals like Gallant, and far-right
coalition partners who have resisted any post-Gaza strategy that could
open the way to a future Palestinian state.</p>
<p>The head of Israel’s parliamentary Foreign Affairs and Defence
Committee, Yuli Edelstein, told Army Radio on Sunday that fighting
Hezbollah would be complex either way, now or later.</p>
<p>“We are not in the right position to conduct fighting on both the
southern front and the northern front. We will have to deploy
differently in the south in order to fight in the north,” said
Edelstein, also a Likud member.</p>
<p>Edelstein criticized a video by Netanyahu released last week in which
the prime minister said the Biden administration was “withholding
weapons and ammunitions to Israel.” The video led to a spat with the
White House.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden’s administration paused a shipment of 2,000 pound
and 500-pound bombs in May over concerns about their impact if used in
densely-populated areas of Gaza. Israel was still due to get billions of
dollars worth of U.S. weaponry.</p>
<p>“I hope that in the discussions behind closed doors much more will be
achieved than by attempts to create pressure with videos,” Edelstein
said, referring to Gallant’s trip.</p>
<p>Israel’s ground and air campaign in Gaza was triggered when Hamas-led
militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200
people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli
tallies.</p>
<p>The offensive has killed more than 37,400 people, according to
Palestinian health authorities, and left nearly the entire population of
the enclave homeless and destitute.</p>

id="fbi-offers-reward-for-information-about-deadly-southern-new-mexico-wildfires">FBI
offers reward for information about deadly southern New Mexico
wildfires</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>RUIDOSO, N.M. — Federal authorities offered a reward for information
about those responsible for igniting a pair of New Mexico wildfires that
killed two people and destroyed hundreds of homes in the past week.</p>
<p>The FBI on Saturday offered up to $10,000 for information in
connection with the South Fork Fire and Salt Fire in southern New
Mexico, which forced thousands to flee.</p>
<p>An agency statement said it was seeking public assistance in
“identifying the cause” of the fires near Ruidoso, New Mexico, that were
discovered June 17. But the notice also pointedly suggested human hands
were to blame, saying the reward was for information leading to arrest
and conviction of “the person or persons responsible for starting the
fires.”</p>
<p>The South Fork Fire, which reached 26 square miles (67 square
kilometers), was 26% contained on Saturday, while the Salt Fire, at 12
square miles (31 square kilometers), was 7% contained as of Saturday
morning, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Full
containment was not expected until July 15.</p>
<p>Recent rains and cooler weather have assisted more than 1,000
firefighters working to contain the fires. Fire crews on Saturday took
advantage of temperatures in the 70s  Fahrenheit (21 to 26 Celsius),
scattered showers and light winds to use bulldozers to dig protective
lines while hand crews used shovels in more rugged terrain to battle the
fires near the mountain village of Ruidoso.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in New Mexico, heavy rain and flash flood warnings prompted
officials to order some mandatory evacuations Friday in the city of Las
Vegas, New Mexico, and communities near Albuquerque, about 200 miles
(320 kilometers) north of Ruidoso. Las Vegas set up shelters for
displaced residents, and some evacuation orders remained in place there
on Saturday.</p>
<p>Flash flood warnings were canceled Saturday, though the National
Weather Service said afternoon storms could produce excessive runoff and
more flooding in the area.</p>
<p>The wildfires have destroyed or damaged an estimated 1,400
structures. Other fallout from the fires, including downed power lines,
damaged water, sewer and gas lines, flooding in burn scars, continued
“to pose risks to firefighters and the public,” according to a Saturday
update from the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources
Department. </p>
<p>Evacuations in areas near Ruidoso and road closures were still in
effect. In Ruidoso, full-time residents will be allowed to return
Monday, though everyday life won’t return to normal.</p>
<p>“You’re going to need to bring a week’s worth of food, you’re going
to need to bring drinking water,” Mayor Lynn Crawford said on
Facebook. </p>
<p>President Joe Biden issued a disaster declaration for parts of
southern New Mexico on Thursday, freeing up funding and more resources
to help with recovery efforts including temporary housing, low-cost
loans to cover uninsured property and other emergency work in Lincoln
County and on lands belonging to the Mescalero Apache Tribe.</p>
<p>Deanne Criswell, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, met with Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, Crawford and Mescalero
Apache President Thora Walsh Padilla on Saturday. “These communities
have our support for as long as it takes to recover,” Criswell posted on
the social media platform X.</p>
<p>Much of the Southwest has been exceedingly dry and hot in recent
months. Those conditions, along with strong wind, whipped the flames out
of control, rapidly advancing the South Fork Fire into Ruidoso in a
matter of hours. Evacuations extended to hundreds of homes, businesses,
a regional medical center and the Ruidoso Downs horse track.</p>
<p>Nationwide, wildfires have scorched more than 3,344 square miles
(8,660 square kilometers) this year, a figure higher than the 10-year
average, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.</p>

<h2 id="us-political-trailblazer-shirley-chisholm-honored-in-exhibit">US
political trailblazer Shirley Chisholm honored in exhibit</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — She was the first African American woman in U.S. Congress
and the first woman and African American to seek the presidential
nomination from one of the two major U.S. political parties.</p>
<p>Shirley Chisholm, who would have turned 100 in November, has served
as an inspiration to several generations of female and minority
politicians, including current Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>Less than five months before a hotly contested presidential election
pitting Democrat Joe Biden and Republican Donald Trump, the Museum of
the City of New York is honoring Chisholm’s legacy with a special
exhibit.</p>
<p>Zinga Fraser, the co-curator of the show titled “Changing the Face of
Democracy: Shirley Chisholm at 100” said honoring the politician’s
legacy is even more important during an election year.</p>
<p>“If there’s any person to remind us about democracy and what’s
possible and where we need to go,” that would be Chisholm, Fraser
said.</p>
<p>Writing on Chisholm’s birthday on November 30, 2020 — after Harris
had just been elected the first African American vice president and the
first woman in that role — Harris said Chisholm “paved the way for me
and so many others.”</p>
<p>“We celebrate her brilliance and boldness to break down barriers,
fight to increase the minimum wage, and speak for those who otherwise
wouldn’t have a voice in the political process,” Harris wrote on
Instagram.</p>
<p>Catalyst for change</p>
<p>Born in 1924 in Brooklyn, New York, to parents from Barbados and
Guyana, Chisholm transformed American democracy in the 1960s and 1970s
with her political slogan “Unbought and Unbossed.”</p>
<p>In 1968, Chisholm became the first Black woman elected to Congress
and four years later launched a bid for the White House. While she
didn’t win the nomination of the Democratic Party, she still served as a
catalyst for change.</p>
<p>“I ran because somebody had to do it first,” she reflected later. “I
ran because most people think the country is not ready for a Black
candidate, not ready for a woman candidate. Someday …”</p>
<p>During her political career, Chisholm fought for abortion rights,
food assistance, education and worker protection, as well as police and
prison reform. She also campaigned against the war in Vietnam and
apartheid in South Africa.</p>
<p>But even more important is the example she set, according to
Fraser.</p>
<p>“I think what you also see as a part of her legacy is just more in
terms of women and women of color in the office,” Fraser said.</p>
<p>Before Chisholm was elected to the House of Representatives in 1968,
there were only four Black men and 11 white women or other minorities in
Congress.</p>
<p>According to the Center for American Women and Politics, there are
now 28 Black women in the House (out of 435 representatives, including
126 women) and one in the Senate (out of 100 senators, including 25
women).</p>
<p>‘Shirley’ on Netflix</p>
<p>During the 1972 primaries, Chisholm recruited student and activist
Barbara Lee, who went on to serve as California’s Democratic
representative in the House since 1998.</p>
<p>“Shirley Chisholm was more than a mentor to me,” 77-year-old Lee
wrote on X. “She inspired me to live a life of service, fearlessness,
&amp; dedication to justice &amp; equity.”</p>
<p>Chisholm, who died in 2005, also is being honored this year by a
Netflix documentary that was released in March.</p>
<p>In “Shirley,” the trailblazing politician, played by actress Regina
King, confronts other lawmakers and decides to compete in the primaries
alone.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>Andrew S. Tanenbaum, professor emeritus of Computer Science at VU
Amsterdam, receives the ACM Software System Award for MINIX, which
influenced the teaching of Operating Systems principles to multiple
generations of students and contributed to the design of widely used
operating systems, including Linux. Tanenbaum created MINIX 1.0 in 1987
to accompany his textbook, Operating Systems: Design and Implementation.
MINIX was a small microkernel-based UNIX operating system for the IBM
PC, which was popular at the time. It was roughly 12,000 lines of code,
and in addition to the microkernel, included a memory manager, file
system and core UNIX utility programs. It became free open-source
software in 2000. ↫ VU Amsterdam website Definitely a deserved award for
Tanenbaum, and it’s a minuscule bit of pride that VU Amsterdam happens
to be my Alma mater. He also wrote an article for OSNews way back in
2006, detailing MINIX 3, which is definitely a cool notch to have on our
belt.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“I realize that most people who’ve never been in the boardroom have a
lot of questions (and often, anxieties) about what happens on a board,
so I wanted to share a very subjective view of what I’ve seen and
learned over the years.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is great, and jibes with my experiences both being on boards and
supporting them as a part of various organizations.
</p>
<p>
The most functional boards I’ve seen do what Anil describes here:
they’re pre-briefed and are ready to have a substantive discussion in a
way that pushes the organization forward. Board meetings have a heavy
reporting component, for sure, but the discussion and working sessions
are always the most meaningful component.
</p>
<p>
This is also often true, and a challenge:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“I believe in the structure of a board (usually along with some separate
advisors) to help an organization reach its fullest potential, in much
the same way as I believe in governments having separate branches with
separate forms of accountability and appointment. In practice, having
nearly all-powerful executives select the membership of the organization
that’s meant to hold them accountable tends to fail just as badly in
business or non-profits as it does in governments.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The board meetings I’ve attended that are the most robust and open to
discussion and genuine debate have also been the ones attached to the
most successful companies. I don’t think it’s quite causation, but
rather two things that come from a particularly pragmatic attitude
towards running a business: one where outside perspectives and
differences of opinion are a strength, not a threat.

<h2
id="trump-backs-ten-commandments-in-all-schools-urges-christians-to-vote">Trump
backs Ten Commandments in all schools, urges Christians to vote</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Donald Trump told a group of evangelicals they “cannot
afford to sit on the sidelines” of the 2024 election, imploring them at
one point to “go and vote, Christians, please!” </p>
<p>Trump also endorsed displaying the Ten Commandments in schools and
elsewhere while speaking to a group of politically influential
evangelical Christians in Washington on Saturday. He drew cheers as he
invoked a new law signed in Louisiana this week requiring the Ten
Commandments to be displayed in every public school classroom. </p>
<p>“Has anyone read the ‘Thou shalt not steal’? I mean, has anybody read
this incredible stuff? It’s just incredible,” Trump said at the
gathering of the Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition. “They don’t want it to
go up. It’s a crazy world.’’ </p>
<p>Trump a day earlier posted an endorsement of the new law on his
social media network, saying: “I LOVE THE TEN COMMANDMENTS IN PUBLIC
SCHOOLS, PRIVATE SCHOOLS, AND MANY OTHER PLACES, FOR THAT MATTER. READ
IT — HOW CAN WE, AS A NATION, GO WRONG???” </p>
<p>The former president and presumptive Republican presidential nominee
backed the move as he seeks to galvanize his supporters on the religious
right, which has fiercely backed him after initially being suspicious of
the twice-divorced New York City tabloid celebrity when he first ran for
president in 2016. </p>
<p>That support has continued despite his conviction in the first of
four criminal cases he faces, in which a jury last month found him
guilty of falsifying business records for what prosecutors said was an
attempt to cover up a hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels
just before the 2016 election. Daniels claims she had a sexual encounter
with Trump a decade earlier, which he denies. </p>
<p>Trump’s stated opposition to signing a nationwide ban on abortion and
his reluctance to detail some of his views on the issue are at odds with
many members of the evangelical movement, a key part of Trump’s base
that’s expected to help him turn out voters in his November rematch with
Democratic President Joe Biden. </p>
<p>But while many members of the movement would like to see him do more
to restrict abortion, they cheer him as the greatest champion for the
cause because of his role in appointing U.S. Supreme Court justices who
overturned national abortion rights in 2022. </p>
<p>Trump highlighted that Saturday, saying, “We did something that was
amazing,” but the issue would be left to people to decide in the
states. </p>
<p>“Every voter has to go with your heart and do what’s right, but we
also have to get elected,” he said. </p>
<p>While he still takes credit for the reversal of Roe v. Wade, Trump
has also warned abortion can be tricky politically for Republicans. For
months, he deferred questions about his position on a national ban. </p>
<p>Last year, when Trump addressed the Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition, he
said there was “a vital role for the federal government in protecting
unborn life” but didn’t offer any details beyond that. </p>
<p>In April of this year, Trump said he believed the issue should now be
left to the states. He later stated in an interview that he would not
sign a nationwide ban on abortion if it was passed by Congress. He has
still declined to detail his position on women’s access to the abortion
pill mifepristone. </p>
<p>About two-thirds of Americans say abortion should generally be legal,
according to polling last year by The Associated Press-NORC Center for
Public Affairs Research. </p>
<p>Attendees at the evangelical gathering on Saturday said that while
they’d like to see a national abortion ban, Trump isn’t losing any of
their deep support. </p>
<p>“I would prefer if he would sign a national ban,” said Jerri
Dickinson, a 78-year-old retired social worker and Faith &amp; Freedom
member from New Jersey. “I understand though, that as in accordance with
the Constitution, that decision should be left up to the states.” </p>
<p>Dickinson said she can’t stand the abortion law in her state, which
does not set limits on the procedure based on gestational age. But she
said outside of preferring a national ban, leaving the issue to the
state “is the best alternative.” </p>
<p>John Pudner, a 59-year-old who recently started a Faith &amp; Freedom
chapter in his home state of Wisconsin, said members of the movement
feel loyal to Trump but “we’d generally like him to be more
pro-life.” </p>
<p>“I think a lot, you know, within the pro-life movement feel like,
well, gosh, they’re kind of thinking he’s too far pro-choice,” he said.
“But because they appreciate his Supreme Court justices, like that’s a
positive within the pro-life community.” </p>
<p>According to AP VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of the electorate,
about 8 in 10 white evangelical Christian voters supported Trump in
2020, and nearly 4 in 10 Trump voters identified as white evangelical
Christians. White evangelical Christians made up about 20% of the
overall electorate that year. </p>
<p>Beyond just offering their own support in the general election, the
Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition plans to help get out the vote for Trump
and other Republicans, aiming to use volunteers and paid workers to
knock on millions of doors in battleground states. </p>
<p>Trump on Saturday said evangelicals and Christians “don’t vote as
much as they should,” and joked that while he wanted them to vote in
November, he didn’t care if they voted again after that. </p>
<p>He portrayed Christianity as under threat by what he suggested was an
erosion of freedom, law and the nation’s borders. </p>
<p>He returned several times during his roughly 90-minute remarks to the
subject of the U.S.-Mexico border and at one point, when describing
migrants crossing it as “tough,” he joked that he told his friend Dana
White, the president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, to enlist
them in a new version of the sport. </p>
<p>“‘Why don’t you set up a migrant league and have your regular league
of fighters. And then you have the champion of your league, these are
the greatest fighters in the world, fighting the champion of the
migrants,’” Trump described saying to White. “I think the migrant guy
might win, that’s how tough they are. He didn’t like that idea too
much.” </p>
<p>His story drew laughs and claps from the crowd. </p>
<p>Later Saturday, Trump plans to hold an evening rally in
Philadelphia.</p>

what to think</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-22, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<div class="e-content entry-content">
<p>
<img src="https://werd.io/file/6676f7cc87e89afb84043d82/thumb.jpg" alt="A protest" width="1024" height="683">
</p>
<p>
Last year I wrote a little about how I hope AI will be
used, <a href="https://werd.io/2023/the-map-reduce-is-not-the-territory">using
the GPS navigation in my car as an analogy</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I like my GPS. I use it pretty much every time I drive. But it’s not
going to make the final decision about which way I go.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Perhaps it seems obvious, but I’d like to extend that analogy to news,
media, and influencers.
</p>
<p>
We all need journalism — and particularly investigative journalism — to
inform us and help us make better decisions. We need to take in sources,
form opinions based on them, and vote accordingly as a baseline. But
democratic participation doesn’t start and end with voting: we also need
to know how to use our voices, spend our money, organize our
communities, and, in areas we feel particularly strongly about, protest.
</p>
<p>
I do think we all need to use our voices. I’m wary when people are
silent: whether this is their intention or not, silence is acquiescence
to the status quo. If our government is doing something harmful on our
behalf and we don’t speak out about it, or an atrocity is taking place
somewhere and we choose not to speak up, our lack of action is an
endorsement. Change only happens when people speak up.
</p>
<p>
But this only makes sense when we make up our own mind. If our opinions
that copy what’s popular, or what a particular news outlet has to say,
then we’re not exercising our democratic rights at all. We’re handing
over that power to someone else. When we let someone make our mind up
for us, using our voice is just amplifying <em>their</em> voice.
</p>
<p>
When people complain that we’re not all watching the same newscasts
anymore, that’s the world they want to create: one where we’re all
getting the same narrow band of information and forming opinions in the
same way. That’s not democracy; that’s homogeny. It’s worth considering
<em>whose</em> voices could be heard in that world. How diverse was it?
Who was really represented?
</p>
<p>
Similarly, while there is certainly disinformation put out in the world
that’s designed to coerce people to exercise their democratic rights in
a particular direction (often towards fascism), some people have also
used the words “misinformation” and “disinformation” (or “fake news”) to
describe reporting that they simply don’t like.
</p>
<p>
This is the playbook of Trumpworld. When all of journalism is painted as
biased and “fake news” — as Trump has taken pains to do — supporters are
left with the officially-endorsed channels like Fox News, OANN, and
Newsmax. They receive a narrow band of information that becomes the
basis of their opinion-making. For example, during Trump’s presidency
and beyond, these channels frequently pushed narratives that undermined
trust in mainstream media, labeled critical reports as conspiracies, and
even presented alternative facts about significant events like the
COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 election results. This systematic
discrediting of journalism fosters an echo chamber that isolates its
audience from opposing viewpoints and critical analysis.
</p>
<p>
But there’s a streak of this in Democrat-land, too: a subset of the
community that’s sometimes been described as “blue MAGA” for its use of
similar rhetoric. Here, any voice that criticizes Biden is <em>also
</em>described as fake news, or even a Putin plot. For instance, when
progressive commentators or journalists critique Biden’s policies on
immigration or healthcare, they are sometimes met with accusations of
undermining the Democratic agenda or aiding Republican narratives. This
phenomenon isn’t as pervasive as Trumpworld’s approach, but it
highlights a discomfort with internal criticism within certain
Democratic circles. While I’d clearly prefer a Democratic America to one
run by Trump, this dismissal of uncomfortable sources as being fake
because we don’t like them is no less undemocratic.
</p>
<p>
And, of course, the same goes for people who learn how to vote and what
to think from their places of worship. In some religious communities,
congregants are encouraged to vote in line with specific doctrinal
beliefs, which can limit their exposure to broader societal issues and
alternative viewpoints. It’s a hell of a waste of a free mind and a
democratic bill of rights.
</p>
<p>
We need to consume information from a variety of sources, be critically
aware of the biases and origins of those sources so that we can properly
evaluate and contextualize them, and then <em>make up our own
minds</em>, regardless of whether our conclusions are popular or not.
</p>
<p>
Making up our own minds has gotten a bad name lately through people who
“do their own research” and end up promoting ivermectin for covid,
believing that vaccines cause autism, or that climate change isn’t real.
I’m not arguing for abandoning critical reasoning or scientific fact
here; quite the opposite. The antidote to this kind of quackery is
stronger critical thinking and source evaluation, not — as some have
argued — restricting our information diet to a few approved sources.
</p>
<p>
New voices and sources matter. The world changes. Lots of things that
were wildly unpopular and sneered at in the past are now part of
ordinary life. For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Abolition
</li>
<li>
Women’s suffrage
</li>
<li>
Access to birth control
</li>
<li>
Interracial marriage
</li>
<li>
Marriage equality
</li>
<li>
The 40 hour work-week
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Each of these things were hard-won by people who were very much outside
the mainstream until they weren’t. Consider what it would have meant to
be silent while each of those struggles for basic rights were underway,
or what it might say about a person if they stayed silent because doing
otherwise would affect their job prospects or earnings potential. These
ideas weren’t popular to begin with, but they were <em>right</em>.
</p>
<p>
Even the internet was dismissed as a weird fad in the nineties. The
mainstream press didn’t think it would catch on; people inside newsrooms
had to fight to establish the first news websites. Memorably, one
British magazine called it “the new name for ham radio” — just a few
years before it took over the world.
</p>
<p>
What matters is not adherence to the values of a tribe. We aren’t better
people if we demonstrate that our values are the same as an accepted
set. The world isn’t like supporting a sports team, where you put on a
red or a blue jersey and sing the same songs in the stands. It’s
nuanced, and each of us can and should have our own nuanced perspectives
that are informed by our lived experiences and those of the people
around us, and a set of diverse, freely-reported information sources.
</p>
<p>
For the avoidance of doubt, my values are vehemently anti-war,
pro-immigration, and fiercely on the side of diversity, equity, and
inclusion. I believe in the right to choose. I believe that trans women
are women and trans men are men. I believe that too-small government
leads to big corporate power, and too-big government leads to
authoritarianism, so a continual balance must be found. I believe that
universal healthcare is a fundamental human right. I believe guns must
be controlled. I roll my eyes when people complain about socialism in
America, because usually what they mean when they use that word is what
I’d consider to be basic infrastructure. I think there needs to be a
ceasefire in Gaza and in Ukraine. I dislike patriotism because I think
it encourages people to care more about people who are geographically
close to them. I believe Ayn Rand’s “morality of self-interest” is an
excuse to act without compassion. I like startups and believe in the
right to start and run a business — and that they can be the vehicle for
great change. I think climate change is not just real and behind many of
the geopolitical decisions we’re seeing playing out today. I believe
that the civil rights marches and movements of the 2020s are the signs
of really exciting progressive change. I believe Trump must not become
President. I believe a progressive world is a better world.
</p>
<p>
And <em>I believe in talking about those things and why I believe
them</em>. Loudly. Even when it’s uncomfortable. There is no media
outlet I’m aware of that publishes based on that exact set of values.
You might nod your head in agreement with some of them and be angered by
others.
</p>
<p>
The news I read and the information I gather is my GPS. I appreciate the
signal, and it will certainly inform my actions and beliefs. I’m still
going to find my own way.

id="exclusive-us-confirms-iran-will-run-absentee-ballot-stations-in-us">Exclusive:
US confirms Iran will run absentee ballot stations in US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The Biden administration will again allow Iran to run
absentee voter stations on U.S. soil for next week’s Iranian
presidential election, VOA has learned, prompting the Islamic republic’s
critics to denounce the plan as absurd and shameful.</p>
<p>Iranian Foreign Ministry official Alireza Mahmoudi told state media
on Sunday that Tehran is planning to set up more than 30 ballot stations
across the United States for the June 28 vote to replace Iranian
President Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash last month.</p>
<p>Mahmoudi said ballot boxes for Iranian absentee voters would be set
up at the Iranian Interests Section of the Pakistani embassy in
Washington and in New York but did not identify other locations.</p>
<p>Iranian state media say the United States is home to the largest
proportion of overseas-based Iranians at 30%. The U.S. Census Bureau’s
American Community Survey estimates there are about half a million
people born in Iran or of Iranian origin in the U.S., while the Iranian
American nonprofit group National Union for Democracy in Iran, or NUFDI,
says it has a higher estimate of more than 1 million.</p>
<p>Canada and Turkey follow with 12% shares of the Iranian diaspora,
according to Iranian state media. Mahmoudi said Iran is arranging
absentee voting in other diaspora locations as well.</p>
<p>In a statement reported exclusively by VOA, the U.S. State Department
said on Friday it has no expectation that Iran’s presidential election
will be free or fair. The Islamic republic’s ruling clerics permit only
loyalists of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to run for offices
such as president and parliament, which are subservient to him on key
policy issues.</p>
<p>Iran’s last parliamentary and presidential elections, in March and
2021, respectively, drew record-low official turnouts, with the lack of
choices leaving much of the electorate disinterested.</p>
<p>Opponents of Iran’s clerical rulers at home and abroad repeatedly
have called for boycotts of Iranian elections, which they view as shams,
and they have done so again for the June 28 vote. They also have noted
that the Islamic republic seeks legitimacy for its 45-year authoritarian
rule by trying to boost turnout for such elections.</p>
<p>VOA asked the State Department how authorizing ballot stations in the
U.S. for Iran, whose poor human rights record it has strongly
criticized, is consistent with the U.S. view of Iranian elections as
neither free nor fair.</p>
<p>A spokesperson responded by noting that Iran set up U.S.-based ballot
stations for previous presidential elections, in 2021 and 2017, with
approval from the Biden administration and its predecessor, the Trump
administration, respectively.</p>
<p>“This is nothing new,” the spokesman said, in reference to the
planned ballot stations for next week’s vote.</p>
<p>Richard Goldberg, a senior adviser to the Washington-based Foundation
for Defense of Democracies, countered that permitting Iran to engage in
another round of absentee balloting on U.S. soil is a “theater of the
absurd.”</p>
<p>In a statement to VOA, Goldberg wrote: “How and why we would
facilitate such a charade for a state sponsor of terrorism that is
hunting Americans every day is beyond me.” He also questioned who would
be operating Iran’s ballot stations in the U.S. and what relationship
they have to the Iranian government.</p>
<p>VOA put those questions to Iran’s U.N. mission, which responded by
saying it declines to comment because it “believes the issue is not of
interest to an American audience.”</p>
<p>A day before Iran’s 2021 presidential election, the Iranian Interests
Section in Washington published an online chart showing the addresses of
ballot stations in 29 U.S. cities where Iranian citizens could vote.
Besides the Interests Section, the other listed venues included 20
properties of U.S. and British hotel companies and eight Islamic
centers. There was no indication of who operated the stations.</p>
<p>VOA contacted three hotels that hosted the 2021 ballot stations on
Friday to ask if they were planning to host such stations again next
week. Staff members who answered the phones at the Marriott Spring Hill
Suites in Gaithersburg, Maryland, and at the Hilton Garden Inn
Irvine-Orange County Airport in California said they had no record of
such events on their schedules. A woman who answered the phone at the
Comfort Inn Sandy Springs in Atlanta, Georgia, repeatedly hung up when
asked if it is hosting an event next Friday.</p>
<p>Cameron Khansarinia, vice president of the Iranian American group
NUFDI, told VOA that diaspora Iranians have a responsibility to protest
the Islamic republic’s “shameful” absentee voter stations wherever they
are set up.</p>
<p>In reference to those who operate and vote at the planned ballot
stations, Khansarinia said, “While we should respect the physical safety
of these individuals and U.S. law, they deserve to be publicly shamed
for their absolutely amorality.”</p>
<p>VOA also asked the State Department whether U.S. authorities have
granted licenses to businesses and nonprofit groups that plan to host
the Iranian ballot stations to exempt them from U.S. sanctions that
generally prohibit the provision of commercial services to Iran.</p>
<p>The spokesperson replied, “Foreign governments carrying out
election-related activities in the U.S. must do so in a manner
consistent with U.S. law and regulations.”</p>
<p>The Treasury Department did not respond to similar questions sent by
VOA on Tuesday, regarding the granting of licenses for Iranian ballot
stations.</p>
<p>Brian O’Toole, a former senior adviser in the Treasury Department’s
Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, told VOA it is a gray
area.</p>
<p>O’Toole, a nonresident senior fellow at the Washington-based Atlantic
Council, identified two U.S. regulations, OFAC’s General License E and
the Code of Federal Regulations section 560.545, as potentially
permitting election activity and democracy-building in Iran.</p>
<p>“Despite the Iranian government’s issues with elections, the U.S. has
a clear interest in promoting democracy,” said O’Toole, who managed
OFAC’s sanctions program during former President Barack Obama’s
administration.</p>
<p>“What this administration probably would lean toward is the principle
that people who are eligible to vote [in Iran’s election] should make
the decision as to whether they should or should not,” he said.</p>

rain, flash flooding prompt evacuations in New Mexico</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LAS VEGAS, NEW MEXICO — Heavy rain and flash flood warnings in the
U.S. state of New Mexico prompted officials to order mandatory
evacuations Saturday, with shelters set up for displaced residents.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service announced a flash flood emergency on
Friday night through early Saturday. The impacted areas included the
city of Las Vegas and communities near Albuquerque.</p>
<p>Up to 5 centimeters (2 inches) of rain had fallen by late Friday,
with additional rainfall up to 3.8 centimeters (1.5 inches) expected
overnight, the weather service said.</p>
<p>There was flash flooding with multiple road closures on the north and
west sides of Las Vegas, the weather service said.</p>
<p>The Las Vegas municipal government announced mandatory evacuations of
parts of the city in social media posts, warning residents to prepare
for overnight stays. The city said it established shelters for residents
on the west and east sides of the city.</p>
<p>The city government asked residents to limit nonessential water use,
while also clarifying that online rumors suggesting the city’s dams had
broken were false and that the dams “are currently intact.”</p>
<p>New Mexico also suffered devastating wildfires this week that killed
at least two people and forced thousands to flee from the flames. The
South Fork and Salt fires in south-central New Mexico destroyed or
damaged an estimated 1,400 structures. FEMA Administrator Deanne
Criswell and New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham planned to tour
the disaster area Saturday.</p>

aircraft carrier arrives in South Korea as show of force against
North</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SEOUL, South Korea — A nuclear-powered United States aircraft carrier
arrived Saturday in South Korea for a three-way exercise stepping up
their military training to cope with North Korean threats that escalated
with its alignment with Russia.</p>
<p>The arrival of the USS Theodore Roosevelt strike group in Busan came
a day after South Korea summoned the Russian ambassador to protest a
pact reached between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean
leader Kim Jong Un this week that pledges mutual defense assistance in
the event of war. South Korea says the deal poses a threat to its
security and warned that it could consider sending arms to Ukraine to
help fight off the Russian invasion as a response — a move that would
surely ruin its relations with Moscow.</p>
<p>Following a meeting between their defense chiefs in Singapore earlier
in June, the United States, South Korea and Japan announced Freedom
Edge. The new multidomain exercise is aimed at sharpening the countries’
combined response in various areas of operation, including air, sea and
cyberspace.</p>
<p>The Theodore Roosevelt strike group will participate in the exercise
that is expected to start within June. South Korea’s military didn’t
immediately confirm specific details of the training.</p>
<p>South Korea’s navy said in a statement that the arrival of
the Theodore Roosevelt demonstrates the strong defense posture of the
allies and “stern willingness to respond to advancing North Korean
threats.” The carrier’s visit comes seven months after another U.S.
aircraft carrier, the USS Carl Vinson, came to South Korea in a show of
strength against the North.</p>
<p>The Theodore Roosevelt strike group also participated in a three-way
exercise with South Korean and Japanese naval forces in April in the
disputed East China Sea, where worries about China’s territorial claims
are rising.</p>
<p>In the face of growing North Korean threats, the United States, South
Korea and Japan have expanded their combined training and boosted the
visibility of strategic U.S. military assets in the region, seeking to
intimidate the North. The United States and South Korea have also been
updating their nuclear deterrence strategies, with Seoul seeking
stronger assurances that Washington would swiftly and decisively use its
nuclear capabilities to defend its ally from a North Korean nuclear
attack.</p>

id="after-mass-killings-complex-question-follows-demolish-or-press-on">After
mass killings, complex question follows: Demolish, or press on?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PITTSBURGH — Last week in Parkland, Florida, wrecking equipment began
demolishing the building at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School where a
gunman’s rampage in 2018 ended with 17 people dead. As the rumble of
destruction echoed, people in the community set to explaining exactly
why ripping the building down was so meaningful — and so crucial.</p>
<p>From former student Bryan Lequerique: “It’s something that we all
need. It’s time to bring an end to this very hurtful chapter in
everyone’s lives.” And Eric Garner, a broadcasting and film teacher,
said: “For 6½ years we have been looking at this monument to mass murder
that has been on campus every day. … So coming down, that’s the
monumental event.”</p>
<p>Parkland. Uvalde. Columbine. Sandy Hook. A supermarket in Buffalo. A
church in South Carolina. A synagogue in Pittsburgh. A nightclub in
Orlando, Florida. When violence comes to a public place, as it does all
too often in our era, a delicate question lingers in the quiet
afterward: What should be done with the buildings where blood was shed,
where lives were upended, where loved ones were lost forever?</p>
<p>Which is the appropriate choice — the defiance of keeping them
standing, or the deep comfort that can come with wiping them off the
map? Is it best to keep pain right in front of us, or at a distance?</p>
<p>How different communities have approached the problem</p>
<p>This question has been answered differently over the years.</p>
<p>The most obvious example in recent history is the decision to
preserve the concentration camps run by Nazi Germany during World War II
where millions of Jews and others died — an approach consistent with the
post-Holocaust mantras of “never forget” and “never again.” But that was
an event of global significance, with meaning for both the descendants
of survivors and the public at large.</p>
<p>For individual American communities, approaches have varied. Parkland
and others chose demolition. In Pittsburgh, the Tree of Life synagogue,
site of a 2018 shooting, was torn down to make way for a new sanctuary
and memorial.</p>
<p>But the Tops Friendly Markets in Buffalo, New York, and the Emanuel
African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, where
racist mass shootings happened, both reopened. And Columbine High School
still stands, though its library, where so much bloodshed occurred, was
replaced after much impassioned debate. “Finding a balance between its
function as a high school and the need for memorialization has been a
long process,” former student Riley Burkhart wrote earlier this year in
an essay.</p>
<p>What goes into these decisions? Not only emotion and heartbreak.
Sometimes it’s simply a question of resources; not all school districts
can afford to demolish and rebuild. Sometimes it’s about not wanting to
give those who might support the shooter a place to focus their
attention.</p>
<p>“Denying such opportunities for those who celebrate the persecution
and deaths of those different from themselves is a perfectly sound
reason to tear down buildings where mass killings occurred,” Daniel
Fountain, a professor of history at Meredith College in North Carolina,
said in a email.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most significant driving force, though, is the increasing
discussion in recent years about the role of mental health.</p>
<p>“There are changing norms about things like trauma and closure that
are at play that today encourage the notion of demolishing these
spaces,” said Timothy Recuber, a sociologist at Smith College in
Massachusetts and author of “Consuming Catastrophe: Mass Culture in
America’s Decade of Disaster.”</p>
<p>For many years, he said, “the prevailing idea of how to get past a
tragedy was to put your head down and push past it. Today, people are
more likely to believe that having to return to the scene of the crime,
so to speak, is liable to re-inflict harm.”</p>
<p>In Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood, a fence masks the site
where the Tree of Life synagogue stood until it was razed earlier this
year, more than five years after a gunman killed 11 people in the
deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history.</p>
<p>David Michael Slater grew up across the street from the synagogue. He
understands the ambivalence that can come with choosing whether to knock
down.</p>
<p>“It’s easy to see why decision-makers might have chosen one path or
the other. And to me, it seems presumptuous for anyone not part of, or
directly affected by, the choice to quibble with it,” said Slater, who
retired this month after 30 years of teaching middle and high school
English. “That said, the decision to demolish such sites, when seen in
the context of our escalating culture of erasure, should raise
concern.”</p>
<p>The power of memory cuts both ways</p>
<p>From World War II to 9/11, the politics of American memory are
powerful — and nowhere more intricate than in the case of mass
shootings. The loss of loved ones, societal disagreements over gun laws
and differing approaches to protecting children create a landscape where
the smallest of issues can give rise to dozens of passionate and angry
opinions.</p>
<p>To some, keeping a building standing is the ultimate defiance: You
are not bowing to horror nor capitulating to those who caused it. You
are choosing to continue in the face of unimaginable circumstances — a
robust thread in the American narrative.</p>
<p>To others, the possibility of being retraumatized is central. Why,
the thinking goes, should a building where people met violent ends
continue to be a looming — literally — force in the lives of those who
must go on?</p>
<p>It stands to reason, then, that a key factor in deciding the fates of
such buildings coalesces around one question: Who is the audience?</p>
<p>“It’s not a simple choice of should we knock it down or renovate or
let it be,” said Jennifer Talarico, a psychology professor at Lafayette
College in Pennsylvania who studies how people form personal memories of
public events.</p>
<p>“If we’re interested in the memories of the people who directly
experienced the event, that physical space will serve as a specific and
powerful reminder. But if we’re talking about remembering or
commemorating an event for other people, those who did not experience
it, that’s a slightly different calculus,” Talarico said. “Remembering
and forgetting are both powerful forces.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, of course, there is a middle ground: eliminating the
building itself but erecting a lasting memorial to those who were lost,
as Uvalde and other communities have chosen. In that way, the virtues of
mental health and memory can both be honored. Life can go on — not
obliviously, but not impeded by a daily, visceral reminder of the
heartbreak that once visited.</p>
<p>That approach sits well with Slater, who has contemplated such
tragedies both from the standpoint of his hometown synagogue and the
classrooms where he spent decades teaching and keeping kids safe.</p>
<p>“Like every problem in life that matters, simple answers are hard to
come by,” Slater said. “If what replaces the Tree of Life, or Parkland,
or the next defiled place of worship or learning or commerce, can be
made to serve both as proof of our indomitable spirit and as
memorialized evidence of what we strive to overcome, perhaps we can have
the best of both worst worlds.”</p>

families rejoice over move toward citizenship, but some are left
out</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HOUSTON, TEXAS — Hundreds of thousands of immigrants had reason to
rejoice when U.S. President Joe Biden unveiled a highly expansive plan
to extend legal status to spouses of U.S. citizens, but, inevitably,
some were left out.</p>
<p>Claudia Zuniga, 35, married in 2017, which was 10 years after her
husband came to the United States. He moved to Ciudad Juarez, Mexico,
after they wed, knowing that, by law, he had to live outside the country
for years to gain legal status. “Our lives took a 180-degree turn,” she
said.</p>
<p>Biden announced Tuesday that his administration will, in coming
months, allow U.S. citizens’ spouses without legal status to apply for
permanent residency and eventually citizenship without having to first
depart the country for up to 10 years. Some 500,000 immigrants may
benefit, according to senior administration officials.</p>
<p>To qualify, an immigrant must have lived in the United States for 10
years and be married to a U.S. citizen, both as of Monday. Zuniga’s
husband is ineligible because he wasn’t in the United States.</p>
<p>“Imagine, it would be a dream come true,” said Zuniga, who works part
time in her father’s transportation business in Houston. “My husband
could be with us. We could focus on the well-being of our children.”</p>
<p>Every immigration benefit — even those as sweeping as Biden’s
election-year offer — has a cutoff date and other eligibility
requirements. In September, the Democratic president expanded temporary
status for nearly 500,000 Venezuelans who were living in the United
States on July 31, 2023. Those who had arrived a day later were out of
luck.</p>
<p>The Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which
has shielded from deportation hundreds of thousands of people who came
to the United States as young children and is popularly known as DACA,
required applicants be in the United States on June 15, 2012, and
continuously for the previous five years.</p>
<p>About 1.1 million spouses who are in the country illegally are
married to U.S. citizens, according to advocacy group FWD.us., meaning
hundreds of thousands won’t qualify because they were in the United
States for less than 10 years.</p>
<p>Immigration advocates were generally thrilled with the scope of
Tuesday’s announcement, just as Biden’s critics called it a horribly
misguided giveaway.</p>
<p>Angelica Martinez, 36, wiped away tears as she sat next to her
children, ages 14 and 6, and watched Biden’s announcement at the Houston
office of FIEL, an immigrant advocacy group. A U.S. citizen since 2013,
she described a flood of emotions, including regret that her husband
couldn’t travel to Mexico when his mother died five years ago.</p>
<p>“Sadness, joy all at the same time,” said Martinez, whose husband
arrived in Houston 18 years ago.</p>
<p>Brenda Valle of Los Angeles, whose husband has been a U.S. citizen
since 2001 and, like her, was born in Mexico, renews her DACA permit
every two years. “We can start planning more long-term for the future
instead of what we can do for the next two years,” she said.</p>
<p>Magdalena Gutierrez of Chicago, who has been married to a U.S.
citizen for 22 years and has three daughters who are U.S. citizens, said
she had “a little more hope” after Biden’s announcement. Gutierrez, 43,
is eager to travel more across the United States without fearing an
encounter with law enforcement could lead to her being deported.</p>
<p>Allyson Batista, a retired Philadelphia teacher and U.S. citizen who
married her Brazilian husband 20 years ago, recalled being told by a
lawyer that he could leave the country for 10 years or “remain in the
shadows and wait for a change in the law.”</p>
<p>“Initially, when we got married, I was naive and thought, ‘OK, but
I’m American. This isn’t going to be a problem. We’re going to fix
this,’” Batista said. “I learned very early on that we were facing a
pretty dire circumstance and that there would be no way for us to move
forward in an immigration process successfully.”</p>
<p>The couple raised three children who are pursuing higher education.
Batista is waiting for the details of how her husband can apply for a
green card.</p>
<p>“I’m hopeful,” Batista said. “The next 60 days will really tell. But,
obviously, more than thrilled because every step forward is a step
toward a final resolution for all kinds of immigrant families.”</p>
<p>About 50,000 noncitizen children with parents who are married to a
U.S. citizen could also potentially qualify, according to senior
administration officials who briefed reporters on the condition of
anonymity. Biden also announced new regulations that will allow some
DACA beneficiaries and other young immigrants to more easily qualify for
long-established work visas.</p>

id="trump-departs-from-anti-immigrant-rhetoric-with-green-card-proposal">Trump
departs from anti-immigrant rhetoric with green card proposal</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Miami, florida — Former President Donald Trump said in an interview
posted Thursday he wants to give automatic green cards to foreign
students who graduate from U.S. colleges, a sharp departure from the
anti-immigrant rhetoric he typically uses on the campaign trail.</p>
<p>Trump was asked about plans for companies to be able to import the
“best and brightest” in a podcast taped Wednesday with venture
capitalists and tech investors called the “All-In.”</p>
<p>“What I want to do, and what I will do is, you graduate from a
college, I think you should get automatically as part of your diploma a
green card to be able to stay in this country. And that includes junior
colleges, too, anybody graduates from a college. You go there for two
years or four years,” he said, vowing to address this concern on day one
if he is elected president in November.</p>
<p>Immigration has been Trump’s signature issue during his 2024 bid to
return to the White House. His suggestion that he would offer green
cards — documents that confer a pathway to U.S. citizenship — to
potentially hundreds of thousands of foreign graduates would represent a
sweeping expansion of America’s immigration system that sharply diverges
from his most common messages on foreigners.</p>
<p>Trump often says during his rallies that immigrants who are in the
country illegally endanger public safety and steal jobs and government
resources. He once suggested that they are “poisoning the blood of our
country.” He has promised to carry out the largest deportation operation
in U.S. history if elected.</p>
<p>Trump and his allies often say they distinguish between people
entering illegally versus legally. But during his administration, Trump
also proposed curbs on legal immigration such as family-based visas and
the visa lottery program.</p>
<p>Right after taking office in 2017, he issued his “Buy American and
Hire American” executive order, directing Cabinet members to suggest
reforms to ensure that business visas were awarded only to the
highest-paid or most-skilled applicants to protect American workers.</p>
<p>He has previously said the H1-B program commonly used by companies to
hire foreign workers temporarily — a program he has used in the past —
was “very bad” and used by tech companies to get foreign workers for
lower pay.</p>
<p>During the conversation with “All-In,” Trump blamed the coronavirus
pandemic for being unable to implement these measures while he was
president. He said he knew of stories of people who graduated from top
colleges and want to stay in the U.S. but can’t secure visas to do so,
forcing them to return to their native countries, specifically naming
India and China. He said they go on and become multibillionaires,
employing thousands of workers.</p>
<p>“You need a pool of people to work for your company,” Trump said.
“And they have to be smart people. Not everybody can be less than smart.
You need brilliant people.”</p>
<p>In a statement released hours after the podcast was posted, campaign
press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: “President Trump has outlined the
most aggressive vetting process in U.S. history, to exclude all
communists, radical Islamists, Hamas supporters, America haters and
public charges. He believes, only after such vetting has taken place, we
ought to keep the most skilled graduates who can make significant
contributions to America. This would only apply to the most thoroughly
vetted college graduates who would never undercut American wages or
workers.”</p>

dismisses Nevada fake elector case over venue question</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>las vegas, nevada — A Nevada judge dismissed an indictment Friday
against six Republicans accused of submitting certificates to the U.S.
Congress falsely declaring Donald Trump the winner of the state’s 2020
presidential election.</p>
<p>Nevada was one of four states with criminal charges pending against
so-called fake electors.</p>
<p>Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford stood after Clark County District
Judge Mary Kay Holthus ruled that Las Vegas was the wrong venue for the
case and said he’d take the case to the state Supreme Court.</p>
<p>“The judge got it wrong, and we’ll be appealing immediately,” Ford, a
Democrat, told reporters, declining additional comment.</p>
<p>Defense attorneys bluntly declared the case dead, saying that to
bring it now before another grand jury in another venue such as Nevada’s
capital of Carson City would violate a three-year statute of limitations
that expired last December.</p>
<p>“They’re done,” said Margaret McLetchie, attorney for Clark County
Republican Party chairman Jesse Law, one of the defendants in the
case.</p>
<p>‘Society is the victim’</p>
<p>The judge called off the trial, which had been scheduled for January,
for defendants who included state GOP chairman Michael McDonald;
national party committee member Jim DeGraffenreid; national and Douglas
County committee member Shawn Meehan; Storey County clerk Jim Hindle;
and Eileen Rice, a party member from the Lake Tahoe area. Each was
accused of offering a false instrument for filing and uttering a forged
instrument — felonies carrying a penalty of up to four or five years in
prison.</p>
<p>Defense attorneys led by McDonald’s lawyer, Richard Wright, contended
that Ford improperly brought the case before a grand jury in Las Vegas —
Nevada’s largest and most Democratic-leaning city — instead of Carson
City or Reno, northern Nevada cities in a more Republican region where
the alleged crimes occurred.</p>
<p>Challenged by Holthus to respond, Deputy State Attorney General
Matthew Rashbrook argued that “no one county contains the entirety of
these crimes.”</p>
<p>“Society is the victim of these crimes,” the prosecutor said. “Voters
who would have been disenfranchised by these acts … would have been
victims of these crimes.”</p>
<p>But the judge decided that even though McDonald and Law live in Las
Vegas, “everything took place up north.”</p>
<p>After the court hearing, Hindle’s attorney, Brian Hardy, declined to
comment on calls from advocacy groups for his client to resign from his
elected position as overseer of elections in Story County.</p>
<p>Meehan is the only defendant not to have been named by the state
party as a Nevada delegate to the 2024 Republican National Convention
next month in Milwaukee. His defense attorney, Sigal Chattah, said her
client chose not to seek the position. Chattah ran as a Republican in
2022 for state attorney general and lost to Ford by just under 8% of the
vote.</p>
<p>False certifications</p>
<p>Nevada is one of seven presidential battleground states where slates
of fake electors falsely certified that Trump had won in 2020, not
Democrat Joe Biden. The others were Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New
Mexico, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Nevada’s case, filed last December, focused on the actions of six
defendants. Criminal cases in three other states focus on many more — 16
in Michigan, 19 in Georgia and 18 in Arizona.</p>
<p>Kenneth Chesebro, a lawyer who pleaded guilty in Georgia last October
of helping to orchestrate the Trump campaign fake elector scheme in
2020, cooperated with prosecutors in the Nevada criminal investigation
and was not charged.</p>
<p>In testimony before the grand jury that met in Las Vegas in November,
Chesebro said he provided the state GOP with an “organized step-by-step
explanation of what they would have to do” to sign and submit
certificates falsely stating that Trump, not Biden, won in Nevada.</p>
<p>He also called Nevada “extremely problematic” to the fake elector
plot, compared with other states, because the meeting of electors was
overseen by the secretary of state. Also, unlike other states, Nevada
did not have a legal challenge pending in courts at the time.</p>
<p>Trump lost Nevada in 2020 by more than 30,000 votes to Biden and the
state’s Democratic electors certified the results in the presence of
Nevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, a Republican.</p>
