## FreeBSD as a platform for your future technology

date: 2024-07-25, from: OS News

Choosing an operating system for new technology can be crucial for the success of any project. Years down the road, this decision will continue to inform the speed and efficiency of development.&#160;But should you build the infrastructure yourself or rely on a proven system? When faced with this decision, many companies have chosen, and continue to choose, FreeBSD. Few operating systems offer the immediate high performance and security of FreeBSD, areas where new technologies typically struggle. Having a stable and secure development platform reduces upfront costs and development time. The combination of stability, security, and high performance has led to the adoption of FreeBSD in a wide range of applications and industries. This is true for new startups and larger established companies such as Sony, Netflix, and Nintendo. FreeBSD continues to be a dependable ecosystem and an industry-leading platform. ↫ FreeBSD Foundation A FreeBSD marketing document highlighting FreeBSD&#8217;s strengths is, of course, hardly a surprise, but considering it&#8217;s fighting what you could generously call an uphill battle against the dominance of Linux, it&#8217;s still interesting to see what, exactly, FreeBSD highlights as its strengths. It should come as no surprise that its licensing model &#8211; the simple BSD license &#8211; is mentioned first and foremost, since it&#8217;s a less cumbersome license to deal with than something like the GPL. It&#8217;s philosophical debate we won&#8217;t be concluding any time soon, but the point still stands. FreeBSD also highlights that it&#8217;s apparently quite easy to upstream changes to FreeBSD, making sure that changes benefit everyone who uses FreeBSD. While I can&#8217;t vouch for this, it does seem reasonable to assume that it&#8217;s easier to deal with the integrated, one-stop-shop that is FreeBSD, compared to the hodge-podge of hundreds and thousands of groups whose software all together make up a Linux system. Like I said, this is a marketing document so do keep that in mind, but I still found it interesting.

## AI stocks lead tech slump

<p>From the BBC World Service: The stock market sell-off is spreading from the U.S. to Asia and Europe. There have been declines across the board, but companies specializing in AI and semiconductor chips have been hit especially hard. Part of it has to do with expectations of additional trade restrictions from the U.S. on chip trade with China. Then, smaller brands are competing against fashion giants to deck out this year&#8217;s Olympic athletes.</p>

## EPA Union Gets Behind Harris

During GE’s second quarter earnings call yesterday, CEO Scott Strazik and Vice President of Investor Relations Michael Lapides said the company had identified a “material deviation” at one of its factories in Canada and would “re-inspect all of the blades that we have made for offshore wind.” At a public meeting in Nantucket last night, Roger Martella, GE Vernova’s chief sustainability officer, said there were two issues at play. The first was the manufacturing issue — basically, the adhesives applied to the blade to hold it together did not do their job. The second was quality control. “The inspection that should have caught this did not,” he said. Two dozen turbines have been installed as part of the Vineyard Wind project so far, with 72 blades total. GE Vernova has not responded to requests for clarification about how many of them originated at the Canada facility, <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/vineyard-wind-answers?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_ygkWMx7ig1_53E0FhCWukhxmdhiKVXVQMyuhI3hAebhLKiQWquH5UkaaOLi9RJR5U2lWe" rel="noopener" target="_self">reported Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo</a>.

The automaker reported adjusted earnings of 46 cents per share, far below analysts’ expectations of 68 cents per share. The company cited unforeseen costs for repairing problems on slightly older vehicles that are still under warranty. But its EV losses grew, too, reaching $2.5 billion through the first half of 2024. CEO Jim Farley <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/24/ford-motor-company-f-q2-2024-earnings-call-transcr/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_ygkWMx7ig1_53E0FhCWukhxmdhiKVXVQMyuhI3hAebhLKiQWquH5UkaaOLi9RJR5U2lWe#:~:text=We%20are%20increasing%20our%20adjusted,delivering%20at%20the%20low%20end" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">remained bullish</a> in the earnings call, telling investors the company is committed to reducing the losses on EVs but basically said the market has been tough and turbulent, and Ford is honing its strategy. That includes expanding its hybrid portfolio and prioritizing smaller, more affordable EVs. He said Ford “must do a much better job in educating our customers” about the advantages of owning an EV. “Overall, the EV journey has been humbling,” he said, “but it has forced us to get even more fit as a company.”

	Firefighters are battling hundreds of wildfires in Canada’s Alberta province, one of which is nearing a crucial oil pipeline. The Trans Mountain Pipeline carries 890,000 barrels of oil per day from Edmonton to Vancouver. Its operator is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/canadas-imperial-oil-reduces-non-essential-staff-kearl-wildfires-spread-2024-07-24/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_ygkWMx7ig1_53E0FhCWukhxmdhiKVXVQMyuhI3hAebhLKiQWquH5UkaaOLi9RJR5U2lWe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reportedly</a> using sprinklers to protect the pipeline, which was still operating normally yesterday. Some oil producers with operations in Canada’s Fort McMurray oil sands region have pulled staff as a precaution and reduced production. “While wildfires have already forced some producers to curtail production, these fires still threaten a large amount of supply,” ING Group analysts said.
</p><h3>5. Study: Tree bark removes methane from atmosphere</h3><p>
	Microbes living in tree bark are surprisingly effective at removing methane from the atmosphere, according to a new <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07592-w?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_ygkWMx7ig1_53E0FhCWukhxmdhiKVXVQMyuhI3hAebhLKiQWquH5UkaaOLi9RJR5U2lWe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> published in the journal <em><em>Nature</em></em>. Up until now, soil was the only known “terrestrial sink” for methane, a potent but short-lived greenhouse gas that’s responsible for about one third of the global warming since the pre-industrial age. But the research suggests tree bark may be just as effective as soil when it comes to methane removal. Trees are already climate champions because of their ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere, and the authors think these new findings boost their overall climate contribution <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/07/240724123005.htm?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_ygkWMx7ig1_53E0FhCWukhxmdhiKVXVQMyuhI3hAebhLKiQWquH5UkaaOLi9RJR5U2lWe#:~:text=from%20the%20atmosphere.-,Tree%20bark%20surfaces%20play%20an%20important%20role%20in%20removing%20methane,a%20surprising%20additional%20climate%20benefit." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by about 10%</a>.

## Some US states purge Chinese companies from investments amid tensions with China

date: 2024-07-25, from: VOA News USA

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. — As state treasurer, Vivek Malek pushed Missouri's main retirement system to pull its investments from Chinese companies, making Missouri among the first nationally to do so. Now Malek is touting the Chinese divestment as he seeks reelection in an August 6 Republican primary against challengers who also are denouncing financial connections to China.


The Missouri treasurer's race highlights a new facet of opposition to China, which has been cast as a top threat to the U.S. by many candidates seeking election this year. Indiana and Florida also have restricted their public pension funds from investing in certain Chinese companies. Similar legislation targeting public investments in foreign adversaries was vetoed in Arizona and proposed in Illinois and Oklahoma.


China ranks as the world's second-largest economy behind the U.S.


Between 2018 and 2022, U.S. public pension and university endowments invested about $146 billion in China, according to an analysis by Future Union, a nonprofit pro-democracy group led by venture capitalist Andrew King. The report said more than four-fifths of U.S. states have at least one public pension fund investing in China and Hong Kong.


"Frankly, there should be shame — more shame than there is — for continuing to have those investments at this point in time," said King, who asserts that China has used intellectual property from U.S. companies to make similar products that undercut market prices.


"You're talking a considerable amount of money that frankly is competing against the U.S. technology and innovation ecosystem," King said.


But some investment officials and economists have raised concerns that the emerging patchwork of state divestment policies could weaken investment returns for retirees.


"Most of these policies are unwise and would make U.S. citizens poorer," said Ben Powell, an economics professor who is executive director of the Free Market Institute at Texas Tech University.


The National Association of State Retirement Administrators opposes state-mandated divestments, saying such orders should come only from the federal government against specific companies based on U.S. security or humanitarian interests.




The U.S. Treasury Department recently proposed a rule prohibiting American investors from funding artificial intelligence systems in China that could have military uses, such as weapons targeting. In May, President Joe Biden blocked a Chinese-backed cryptocurrency mining firm from owning land near a Wyoming nuclear missile base, calling it a "national security risk."


Yet this isn't the first time that states have blacklisted particular investments. Numerous states, cities and universities divested from South Africa because of apartheid before the U.S. Congress eventually took action. Some states also have divested from tobacco companies because of health concerns.


Most recently, some states announced a divestment from Russia because of its war against Ukraine. But that has been difficult to carry out for some public pension fund administrators.


The quest to halt investments in Chinese companies comes as a growing number of states also have targeted Chinese ownership of U.S. land. Two dozen states now have laws restricting foreign ownership of agricultural land, according to the National Agricultural Law Center at the University of Arkansas. Some laws apply more broadly, such as one facing a legal challenge in Florida that bars Chinese citizens from buying property within 16 kilometers of military installations and critical infrastructure.


State pension divestment policies are "part of a broader march toward more confrontation between China and the United States," said Clark Packard, a research fellow for trade policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. But "it makes it more challenging for the federal government to manage the overall relationship if we've got to deal with a scattershot policy at the state level."


Indiana last year became the first to enact a law requiring the state's public pension system to gradually divest from certain Chinese companies. As of March 31, 2023, the system had about $1.2 billion invested in Chinese entities with $486 million subject to the divestment requirement. A year later, its investment exposure in China had fallen to $314 million with just $700,000 still subject to divestment, the Indiana Public Retirement System said.


Missouri State Treasurer Malek tried last November to get fellow trustees of the Missouri State Employees' Retirement System to divest from Chinese companies. After defeat, he tried again in December and won approval for a plan requiring divestment over a 12-month period. Officials at the retirement system did not respond to repeated questions from The Associated Press about the status of that divestment.


In recent weeks, Malek has highlighted the Chinese divestment in campaign ads, asserting that fentanyl from China "is drugging our kids" and vowing: "As long as I'm treasurer, they won't get money from us. Not one penny."


Two of Malek's main challengers in the Republican primary — state Rep. Cody Smith and state Sen. Andrew Koenig — also support divestment from China.


Koenig said China is becoming less stable and "a more risky place to have money invested."


"In China, the line between public and private is much more blurry than it is in America," Smith said. "So I don't think we can fully know that if we are investing in Chinese companies that we are not also aiding an enemy of the United States." 


A law signed earlier this year by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis requires a state board overseeing the retirement system to develop a plan by September 1 to divest from companies owned by China. The oversight board had announced in March 2022 that it would stop making new Chinese investments. As of May, it still had about $277 million invested in Chinese-owned entities, including banks, energy firms and alcohol companies, according to an analysis by Florida legislative staff.


Florida law already prohibits investment in certain companies tied to Cuba, Iran, Sudan, Venezuela, or those engaged in an economic boycott against Israel.


In April, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs vetoed a bill that would have required divestment from companies in countries determined by the federal government to be foreign adversaries. That list includes China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia and Venezuela.


Hobbs said in a letter to lawmakers that the measure "would be detrimental to the economic growth Arizona is experiencing as well as the State's investment portfolio."

## Former Trump NSC official explains his vision for ending war in Ukraine

date: 2024-07-25, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Retired Army Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg, who was chief of staff on former President Donald Trump’s national security council, spoke with VOA about his vision for ending the war in Ukraine.


Kellogg says he is not a formal adviser to the former president and has not presented his plan to Trump, but it is one of the options that he could consider if he is elected in November.


Kellogg also served as the national security adviser to former Vice President Mike Pence in the Trump administration. He now co-chairs the Center on American Security at America First Policy Institute, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group.


The Ukraine strategy was published back in May by AFPI as part of their An America First Approach to U.S. National Security, edited by Fred Fleitz, who also served as chief of staff at the National Security Council during Trump's presidency and co-wrote with Kellogg the chapter on the Russia-Ukraine war.


It suggests that the U.S. should begin a formal policy "to seek a cease-fire and negotiated settlement of the Ukraine conflict." The U.S. would continue to arm Ukraine to deter Russia from attacking during or after a deal is reached, but under the condition that Kyiv agrees to enter into peace talks with Russia.


To persuade Russia to participate in the negotiations, the U.S. and other NATO partners would delay Ukraine's membership in the alliance for an extended period in exchange for a "comprehensive and verifiable deal with security guarantees."


They write that Ukraine will not be asked to give up its ambition to regain all land seized by Russia, but Kyiv should agree to use diplomatic means only and realize that it might take a long time to regain all the territories. The strategy proposes to use the partial lifting of sanctions on Russia to encourage the Kremlin to take steps toward peace and establish levies on Russian energy imports to fund Ukraine's reconstruction.


The interview with Kellogg, recorded on July 18 at the Republican convention in Milwaukee, has been edited for brevity and clarity.


VOA: Can you tell a little bit about the plan? I think it's the most detailed paper coming publicly from Republican and Republican-affiliated groups.


Retired Army Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg: We've said very clearly in our paper that Ukraine has fought valiantly. They are very well led. We think the Russians did clearly an unwarranted invasion of a sovereign state and this must be addressed. President Trump, to his credit, said in the very first debate when he was asked by one of the commentators, Dana Bash, do the Russians basically get to keep the territories? He said no, not at all. He said not once, he did it twice.


So, there's a negotiation, you are going to figure out what your starting points are going to be. You want to make sure that Ukrainians are not put at the position when they're operating from weaknesses, but from strength. So, the question is how do you do that? And how you put all the pieces and parts in place? Nobody is ever saying that: "Oh, we just have to make Ukrainians to give up land and give it to Russia." Look when you look at your losses, the losses in Ukraine alone, depending on who you talk to, you're talking between 100,000 and 130,000 deaths. That's enormous because when I look at [Russia’s losses] they have had three times that. The United States of America lost 60,000 in the Vietnam war. That was a 20-year war we went away from. The Russians, then the Soviets, lost 15,000 in Afghanistan and walked away from it.


If the Ukrainians say no and the Russians say no, then they can do it in a different way. But I think you started to ask yourself questions is this what's best for Ukraine as a nation? I don't care about Russia. I care about Ukraine.


Let’s say a year and a half ago the Russians turn their heels and if the West had provided the equipment that [Ukrainian] President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy asked for, then you probably could have finished the job. You could have gotten into the Sea of Azov through Kherson, splitting them in half, and that is what you wanted to do. So, I blame this administration and the West to a degree for not supporting Ukraine when they should have.


VOA: The Biden administration is saying that they want to put Ukraine in the position of strength before it can negotiate with Russia. You are suggesting pretty much the same, right?


Kellogg: No, that’s a false statement. Have the United States given Ukraine a support of F-16s? No. Did we provide long-range fires early for the Ukrainians to shoot in Russians? No. Did we provide permission for them to shoot deep into Russia? No. Did the United States provide them the armored capabilities they needed? We gave 31 tanks. Thirty-one tanks is not even a battalion in the United States army. So, they talk about it, but it didn't really happen.


VOA: Ukrainian officials might be cautious about entering into the negotiations with Russians because it might send a signal to their partners that they don't need military aid anymore.


Kellogg: You have to give more arms to them because you can't trust the Russians. You just have to do it, and the question is, do you do this before Europe tires, Americans tire, Ukrainians tire? Two and a half years -- that's a long war and the destruction is enormous. Sometimes you have to look at what we call in America the long game. And that is security guarantees, financial support and military support. We have to bring that to the American people, you know, President Biden has only talked to American people one time. You got to talk to them a lot. President Biden has only talked to [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin one time. When I was with President Trump, he was talking to him 17 different times. It doesn’t mean he likes him. But you have to talk to your adversary.


VOA: Why would Russians want to negotiate?


Kellogg: You need to give them reasons to negotiate. You can give an extreme reason and say, OK, you've got to get back all the land from Ukraine. Maybe, short-term you tell Ukraine, we're not going to support you coming to NATO, but we give you a bilateral security agreement.


VOA: The U.S. and Ukraine have just signed a security agreement.


Kellogg: That was not a defense agreement. A defense agreement should be ratified by the Senate. What you have to do is to come up with a peace agreement like we've done with Korea, we did years ago with Taiwan.


VOA: But what is the contingency plan if Russia doesn’t abide by the agreement.


Kellogg: That is part of negotiation. That's where both sides draw the red lines. That's where both sides make the determination: this is what we're going to do or not do.


VOA: Ukraine already tried that signing the Minsk agreements with Russia.


Kellogg: Minsk agreements worked very well, didn't they? They're lousy. They didn't do anything because nobody trusted anybody, and nobody worked together. You had Minsk 1, failed; Minsk 2, failed. Budapest memorandum, failed. So, you have to have some kind of degree of confidence and security.


VOA: One of the reasons why the negotiations in Istanbul broke down was that Russians demanded Ukraine’s demilitarization, a smaller army.


Kellogg: Yes. And this is an unacceptable demand. And you don't walk into negotiating with unacceptable demands. But you have to have an ability, we call it an interlocutor. An interlocutor is somebody who can sit down and actually negotiate with both parties. It can be Trump, President Trump believes he can do it, but you also have to look at who else is out there. President [Recep Tayyip] Erdogan of Turkey, do you think he could do it? No, he's not going to do it. [Chancellor Olaf] Scholz from Germany, you think he will do it? No, he is not going to do it. [President Emmanuel] Macron from France, he tried but hasn't done it. Well, now they had a change in government in Britain. So that's gone away. You know, I don't know maybe [Klaus] Iohannis, [the president] of Romania. Maybe he could do it, but you have to have somebody that both sides could talk to.


President Trump is talking to both parties. And President Biden is not. Now the option is quite clear: If Ukraine doesn't want to negotiate, fine, but then accept the fact that you can have enormous losses in your cities and accept the fact that you will have your children killed, accept the fact that you don't have 130,000 dead, you will have 230,000–250,000. Demographically, what does that do to the country?


You have to accept the fact that maybe the threat will remain on Kyiv, you have to accept the fact that Kharkiv will have more damage or do you want to say this is time maybe we take a pause and figure out how to push the Russians out of there so that they don't get territorial gain. And how do you have a long-term peace agreement?


Let's use NATO as an example. NATO has already said they're not going to support Ukraine going into NATO until the war is over. That's the reality and that's where you need somebody to stand as a negotiator and say no, this is where we want to go.


The size of this war is not appreciated in the West. That is the largest war in Europe since World War II, it is between the two largest countries in Europe. The losses have been horrific.


It is too great of a country, and I've been there. I have been to Izyum, I've been to Kharkiv and I've seen what Russians did to it. There's no love for Russians. There's a support for sovereignty. Figure out a way does not mean we say give up land.


VOA: The other reason why the negotiations in Istanbul broke down is because it became known what happened in Bucha. It means that if Ukraine allows Russia to continue occupying any of its lands, it condemns the people who live there. ...


Kellogg: Who is saying to give up land?


VOA: Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance alluded to that.


Kellogg: J.D. Vance was just nominated as the vice president last night. Until that, he was just a senator, one of 100. Yeah, you can say a lot of things in the Senate. When you speak for an administration, things change.

## Black Boxes

date: 2024-07-25, from: Ed Summers blog, Inkdroid

<p>
One of the primary reasons I’ve resisted using machine learning models
in my professional work is that they always appear to me in the guise of
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box">black box</a>.
</p>
<p>
A black box is a metaphor used to talk about some computational process
which has known inputs and outputs, but whose internal workings are not
known. It’s an idea that goes back to the beginnings of cybernetics and
modern computing.
</p>
<p>
Computer professionals are trained to distinguish between the <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/model-explainability-aws-ai-ml/interpretability-versus-explainability.html">interpretability
and explainability</a> of machine learning models. But at the end of the
day our ability to understand and adequately communicate how and why
these models work are <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence">active
areas of research</a>.
</p>
<p>
Of course, our ability to understand is constrained because the details
of some models are guarded as business secrets. But more and more we are
seeing documentation efforts increase transparency about how “open
source” models are built. We’ve seen significant efforts to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence_Act">regulate</a>
how they are used and by who. But it’s important to recognize that even
these “Glass Boxes” don’t explain <em>why</em> some of the models work.
</p>
<p>
And that’s the <em>glass half full</em> version.
</p>
<p>
The <em>glass half empty</em> version is that <em>we do understand</em>
how these models work, if you define “we” as <em>someone</em>, or some
set of people, somewhere. The past isn’t evenly distributed too.
</p>
<p>
For a given model <em>someone</em> knows what software was used to build
it–because someone installed it right? Someone made choices about what
algorithms and data structures were used. Someone knows what data was
used to train it because they collected it and fed it in. Someone knows
what data was not fed in, and (maybe) how that biases the model. Someone
knows how much money was spent training and using the model because the
electricity bill got paid.
</p>
<p>
But these systems are very complex that these <em>someones</em> are
almost certainly not the same people. They may not work in the same
organizations. They may not be willing, or even able, to communicate
these things to you, even if you could find them.
</p>
<p>
This is why Nick Seaver says that algorithmic systems are in fact
<em>culture</em>, which require ethnographic methods to understand <span
class="citation" data-cites="Seaver:2017">(<a href="#ref-Seaver:2017"
role="doc-biblioref">Seaver, 2017</a>)</span>.
</p>
<p>
I got my start as a professional programmer when the World Wide Web was
being built in the mid-1990s. I didn’t have a computer science degree,
but I was fortunate to be able to lean on the modest programming
experience I got in high school (BASIC, Pascal and Fortran) to learn a
new language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl">Perl</a> and
apply it. I didn’t become a .com millionaire, but it helped pay the
rent. I felt lucky, and in truth I was. I was already a participant in a
network of privilege.
</p>
<p>
Perl had lots of features for working with text, which leant itself to
be useful in web applications. It had an <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open source</a> culture
that encouraged the sharing of “modules” on <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPAN">CPAN</a> that extended the
language to do things like talk to databases, or work with specific data
formats, or thousands of other things. I loved the attention to detail
in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_Perl">Camel
Book</a> about how the language was built and evolved. I knew that the
<a href="https://xkcd.com/378/">real programmers</a> had written the
Perl interpreter in C. I didn’t really know C that well, but I knew
other people did, and understood that (in theory) I could too. It was
all a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_matter_of_programming">simple
matter of programming</a>, as they say.
</p>
<p>
But the reality was, I didn’t know the details of some of the open
source Perl modules I installed and used. I <em>trusted</em> that the
authors did. I didn’t know how some of the Perl language primitives were
coded in C, but I learned from experience using them, while in
conversation with other programmers, and knew that someone else
somewhere did understand. I participated in the culture of programming
in Perl.
</p>
<p>
The scary thing for me about generative AI is that I don’t have any
meaningful trust relationships with the people who know parts of the
answers to why/how it works. At a fundamental level I don’t know if it
is even theoretically possible to know. Not only that, I have an active
<em>mistrust</em> of some of the organizations that are trying to
convince professionals that this is The New Way, because they stand to
gain so much, while workers and consumers stand to gain so little, and
the environment stands to lose so much more.
</p>
<p>
But, if I’m being generous, perhaps it appears that way because it’s not
my culture?
</p>
<p>
It’s important to recognize that all of us experience some aspect of
computing as a black box. Whether it is using a model from HuggingFace,
an ATM, an app on our phone, or ChatGPT. I think the important question
to ask is how do we participate in its the creation and use of this
technology?
</p>
<p>
Can we open the black box? Can we open the other black boxes we find
inside? Do we know other people who can? What do they say? What is the
culture of this black box? Do I want to be a part of it? Why? Why not?
What choices do I have? What about others?
</p>
<p>
I no longer program in Perl, but I still marvel at how <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall">Larry Wall</a> practiced
computing as a culture.

## Biden speaks, with hope and wistfulness, of decision to leave race

date: 2024-07-25, from: VOA News USA

washington — After three days of silence over his stunning decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race, U.S. President Joe Biden took to prime time television Tuesday to give Americans, and the world, an explanation in a speech that was at times hopeful, at times determined, and at times wistful.


Biden spoke of his five decades in public office, touted his presidential record of domestic and political achievements – but then called for energetic new leadership to face tomorrow’s challenges.



"I revere this office,” said Biden, his hands resting on the glossy, hulking Resolute Desk, the gold-brocade drapes of the Oval Office framing his sloping shoulders. “But I love my country more.”




“Nothing – nothing – can come in the way of saving our democracy,” he said. “That includes personal ambition. So, I decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. It’s the best way to unite our nation. You know, there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life. There's also a time and a place for new voices. Fresh voices. Yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now.”


Biden also thanked Vice President Kamala Harris, who has taken to the campaign trail with his endorsement and enough delegate pledges to net the nomination. He described her as "experienced," "tough," and "capable" but added: “the choice is up to you.”


He did not name-check his Republican opponent in the race. But analysts say Biden’s stark warnings all point to one man.


“He talked about polarization,” said Jennifer Mercieca, a professor of communication and journalism at Texas A&M University. “He talked about violence and political violence. Those are all things that harken back to Donald Trump and his presidency. He talked about the threats facing the nation when he first took office, January 2021. And so that was certainly about Donald Trump. But yeah, this wasn't a place for him to talk about Donald Trump. It wasn't a place for him to give a campaign speech.”


Biden’s job now, he said, will focus on domestic challenges like civil rights and voter freedom, gun safety reforms, the quest to end cancer and Supreme Court reform. He also cited the various challenges the U.S. faces abroad, with wars raging in Gaza and Ukraine and China becoming more emboldened in the Indo-Pacific.


It’s those foreign fires, analysts say, that are likely to concern voters who were already worried about Biden’s future.


“That's really the concern I think people will have, which is: How does a lame duck president deal with foreign policy crises?” said Thomas Schwartz, a history professor at Vanderbilt University.


That question may be answered as soon as Thursday, when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visits the White House in what administration officials told reporters Wednesday is an attempt to stitch up the first phase of a longer cease-fire deal that will end the brutal nine-month conflict in Gaza.


In a sign that foreign leaders may be hedging their bets in this electric American election cycle, the Israeli leader is also holding two other meetings while in the U.S., with Harris and Trump.


But for the final act of this presidency, Joe Biden remains the protagonist on America’s biggest stage. The ending, analysts say, is a classic.


“What has stopped Joe Biden is the thing that has stopped every human being since the beginning of time, and that is, we age,” said Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at the policy and research firm Third Way. “And it got to the point where I feel he could do the job, but he couldn't convince the American people that he could do the job.”




But this could also be a triumphant moment for the 81-year-old president, who was widely thanked by Democrats for making the decision to step aside.


”In some ways,” Kessler said, “he's like an athlete that is going to make the Hall of Fame and is retiring and gets the cheers from the crowds, finally, for a long, 50-year, tremendous career.”


Biden clearly understood that this address would be a dramatic peak. So, he used his final words to break the fourth wall, with a message as old as America:


“The great thing about America,” he said, “is here, kings and dictators do not rule, the people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands.”

## Surprise Yellowstone geyser eruption highlights little-known hazard at park

date: 2024-07-25, from: VOA News USA

BILLINGS, Montana — A surprise eruption of steam in a Yellowstone National Park geyser basin that sent people scrambling for safety as basketball-sized rocks flew overhead has highlighted a little-known hazard that scientists hope to be able to predict someday.


The hydrothermal explosion on Tuesday in Biscuit Basin caused no injuries as dozens of people fled down the boardwalk before the wooden walkway was destroyed. The blast sent rocks, steam, water and dirt high into the air, according to a witness and a scientist who reviewed video footage of the event.


It came in a park teeming with geysers, hot springs and other hydrothermal features that attracts millions of tourists annually. Some, like the famous Old Faithful, erupt like clockwork and are well understood by the scientists who monitor the park's seismic activity.


But the type of explosion that happened this week is less common and understood, and potentially more hazardous given that it occurs without warning.


"This drives home that even small events — and this one in the scheme of things was relatively small, if dramatic — can be really hazardous," said Michael Poland, lead scientist at the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory. "We've gotten pretty good at being able to understand the signs that a volcano is waking up and may erupt. We don't have that knowledge base for hydrothermal systems like the one in Yellowstone."


Monitoring system


Poland and other scientists are trying to change that with a fledgling monitoring system that was recently installed in another Yellowstone geyser basin. It measures seismic activity, deformations in the Earth's surface and low-frequency acoustic energy that could signal an eruption.


The hydrothermal explosions are believed to result from clogged passageways in the extensive natural plumbing network under Yellowstone, Poland said. A clog could cause the heated, pressurized water to turn into steam instantly and explode.


Tuesday's explosion came with little warning.


Witness Vlada March, who captured widely circulated video of the explosion, said steam started rising in the Biscuit Basin "and within seconds, it became this huge thing. ... It just exploded and became like a black cloud that covered the sun."


March's tour guide, Isaac Fisher, told The Associated Press that he heard a hiss coming from Cliff Pool and told his group it was unusual. It looked like a geyser erupting 60 to 70 feet (18 to 21 meters) into the air for a few seconds and then, "Ba-boom!" he said.


"You felt the shock wave hit your chest and vibrate the bones in your chest," he said. "The explosion was so significant, you felt your feet shaking. You felt the boardwalk shake and you felt everything shaking."




He estimated the whole event lasted about 25 seconds as the debris plume climbed to about 100 meters (328 feet) into the air.


"I cannot believe nobody got hurt," Fisher said. "There were rocks whizzing over our heads that were the size of basketballs."


March's mother, who was closest to the eruption, pulled her hoodie over her head and face and wasn't injured, Fisher said.


Some of the rocks hurled into the air measured about a meter (3.3 feet) across, said Poland.


Slumbering volcano


Yellowstone encompasses the caldera of a huge, slumbering volcano that shows no sign of erupting anytime soon but provides the heat for the national park's famous geysers, hot springs, mud pots and various other hydrothermal features. While far less common than geyser eruptions, hydrothermal explosions happen often enough in Yellowstone to be studied — and to be a safety concern.


Scientists don't know if they'll be able to devise a way to predict the blasts, Poland said.


For a geologist, seeing one in person is a payday. That's what happened in 2009, when Montana Tech geology professor Mike Stickney and several other geologists were nearby when one happened close to the scene of Tuesday's blast in the Biscuit Basin.


"It was very sudden and without any detectable warning, just standing on the boardwalk there. It was just was one 'whoosh' and it was done. No one saw it coming," Stickney said.


Though it didn't register on a sensitive seismometer at Old Faithful a couple miles (3.2 kilometers) away, he estimated the recent explosion was 10 times bigger.


In May, after scientists found a crater a few feet (1-2 meters) wide in the Norris Geyser Basin 18 miles (29 kilometers) north of Biscuit Basin, they consulted acoustic and seismic data from the basin's new monitoring system and determined a hydrothermal explosion happened April 15, just a few days before roads opened for spring tourist season.


The data included no obvious precursors, however, that could potentially be used to develop a warning system.


Long-term study of where hydrothermal explosions and other ground disruptions can happen in Yellowstone is a focus of University of Wyoming geology professor Ken Sims, who has used ground-penetrating radar and other techniques to identify problem areas.


The information is critical to building roads and bridges in Yellowstone, he said.


"Whenever you build in a super active system like that, you have to pay attention to what's going on," Sims said.


A detection system takes time and money to develop, with monitoring stations that can cost roughly $30,000 each.


Yet even if explosions such as the recent one in Yellowstone could be predicted, there's no feasible way to prevent them, said Poland.


"One of the things people ask me occasionally is, 'How do you stop a volcano from erupting?' You don't. You get out of the way," Poland said. "For any of this activity, you don't want to be there when it happens."

## Wildfire smoke chokes parts of Canada and western US

date: 2024-07-25, from: VOA News USA

LOS ANGELES — Fires burning in California, Oregon, Arizona, Washington and other western states, as well as Canada, have filled the skies in regions of the western U.S. with smoke and haze, forcing some affected areas to declare air quality alerts or advisories.


As of Wednesday morning, there were 79 large active wildfires across the country being managed that have burned 1,431,460 acres (579,292 hectares), according to the National Interagency Fire Center.


Evacuation orders are in effect for 15 fires in the Northwest, where fires continue to show active to extreme behavior. Communities near several fires in California, the Northern Rockies and the Great Basin are also under evacuation orders.


Where are the big fires?


Oregon has 31 large active fires that have burned 791,653 acres (320,371 hectares). The Durkee Fire, the largest active blaze in the U.S., was burning near the Oregon-Idaho border and was 0% contained as of Wednesday morning and had burned nearly 400 square miles (1,036 square kilometers). The Cow Valley, Falls and Lone Rock fires, the next largest, have collectively seared some 404,404 acres (163,657 hectares).


There are 12 active large wildfires in both California and Arizona. In the Golden State, the Lake Fire in Santa Barbara has scorched 38,664 acres (15,647 hectares) and was 90% contained; the 2024 SQF Lightning Complex in Tulare has burned 31,309 acres (12,670 hectares) and was 7% contained; and the Shelly Fire in Siskiyou County that's charred 15,656 acres (6,336 hectares) was 62% contained. Hot, dry and windy conditions have increase fire activity in some areas, including the Hill Fire in northern California.


The Black Fire east of Phoenix is the largest in Arizona, followed by the Romero Fire west of Dudleyville.


The Pioneer Fire in Washington is the largest in the state at 30,667 acres (12,410.5 hectares). In Montana, the Deadman Fire in Rosebud County grew to 19,982 acres (8,086 hectares) and was 95% contained.


In Canada, there are about 430 active wildfires in British Columbia and 177 in neighboring Alberta, including two that led to the evacuation of up to 25,000 visitors and residents of Canadian Rockies' largest national park.


Fuels and fire behavior advisories were in effect for California, Nevada, Southeast and Central Oregon, Southern Idaho and the Utah and Arizona Strip.


What areas are under air quality alerts?


Unhealthy air pollution from wildfires have triggered air quality alerts and advisories in regions of the western U.S.


The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality issued air quality alerts for the eastern counties of Harney, Malheur, Grant, Baker and Morrow until further notice. Unhealthy air was reported in cities of Bend and La Pine today and forecaster for tomorrow, with smoke expected to continue degrading air quality in La Pine after Thursday. Smoke from the Durkee Fire was choking the air in Boise, Idaho and beyond. An air quality warning was in effect for the entire region on Wednesday.


In Idaho, air quality advisories were sent out to the central counties of Ada, Canyon, Gem, Owyhee, Payette and Washington.


In north central Washington, the Colville Reservation, all of Chelan County, plus the Methow Valley down to Brewster in Okanogan County were under air quality alerts until further notice.


And in Canada, authorities issued an air quality advisory for Calgary, Alberta due to the wildfire smoke. The government agency called it high risk and said children and the elderly should avoid outdoor physical exertion.


How do I stay safe from wildfire smoke?


Wildfire smoke can cause unhealthy air quality in areas many miles away from fires. To stay safe, the South Coast Air Quality Management District recommends people start by learning about air quality conditions and forecasts in their area.


Those with an air conditioning system should change filters often, with high-efficiency filters labeled "MERV13" or higher being the most effective at removing smoke particles. Portable HEPA air purifiers also help.


To limit exposure to unhealthy air quality, people should stay indoors with windows and doors closed. Avoid heavy exertion outdoors, using fans or swamp coolers that take air from outside, all wood-burning appliances, and lighting candles and incense.


If you need to be outside in smoky conditions, a respirator mask such as an N-95 or P-100 can offer some protection.


Lastly, know your risks. Some people, such as children and those with heart or lung issues, can be more sensitive to moderate to unhealthy air quality.

## Democrats poised to virtually nominate Harris and running mate by August 7

date: 2024-07-25, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON  — Democratic National Convention delegates can make Vice President Kamala Harris their presidential nominee — and even start approving her yet-to be-named running mate — in online voting beginning next week, as the party races to coalesce around a new top of its ticket heading into November.


The convention's rules committee on Wednesday passed a proposal where delegates from around the country will be able to vote on potential presidential nominees to replace President Joe Biden, who abandoned his reelection bid last weekend.


But Harris is the only major Democrat to announce publicly that she's seeking the nomination, meaning she'll almost-certainly be approved in a single round of virtual balloting beginning August 1 — some 18 days before the party's convention opens in Chicago.


Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison referenced the unprecedented shakeup in the presidential race left by Biden's bowing out, telling a virtual meeting of the convention's rulemaking arm, "In the darkness of night, we see our brightest stars."


The plan was approved after more than 90 minutes of online discussion that featured little objection. The final vote to pass the full set of convention's rules was 157-3.


They require Harris, and any other potential Democrat willing to challenge her, to submit 300 electronic signatures from convention delegates, not more than 50 of whom can be from the same state, by the evening of July 30.


If multiple candidates qualify, it could spark multiple rounds of voting over several days. But, if Harris is the only candidate, voting would begin August 1. Delegates voting "uncommitted," or for another candidate who hasn't qualified under the rules, will have their choices converted simply to "present."


Delegates will receive ballots via secure email. The process will be designed not only to formally nominate Harris, but to eventually do the same for her vice presidential selection prior to August 7 — giving her a tight window to pick a running mate.


Who she might choose is unclear. Early favorites include Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, but potentially half a dozen other candidates are being considered.


Biden dropped out of the race last weekend and endorsed Harris, and hundreds of Democratic members of Congress and governors, as well as leading labor unions and activist organizations have since backed her to replace him. An Associated Press survey of delegates to the convention also revealed that the vice president has the support of well more than the 1,976 delegates she'll need to win on a first ballot.


That doesn't automatically make her the nominee, though, and the party is pushing ahead with the virtual voting process because it says it can't wait until the convention starts to formally choose its nominee. It blames a deadline to appear on the Ohio ballot stating that candidates must be selected by August 7.


Ohio state lawmakers there have since changed that, but the modification doesn't take effect until September 1 — and DNC attorneys warn that waiting until after the initial deadline to determine a presidential nominee could prompt legal challenges.


"Our party remains steadfast to an open, fair and transparent nominating process," said Minyon Moore, chair of the Democratic convention. "We will do this right."

## Missouri high court blocks release of man whose conviction was overturned

date: 2024-07-25, from: VOA News USA

ST. LOUIS, missouri — The Missouri Supreme Court has blocked the immediate release of a man whose murder conviction was overturned — just as the man was about to walk free.


A St. Louis Circuit Court judge had ordered Christopher Dunn to be released by 6 p.m. CDT Wednesday and threatened the prison warden with contempt if Dunn remained imprisoned. But the attorney general has been fighting his release.


Corrections Department spokeswoman Karen Pojmann said Dunn was signing paperwork to be released when the Missouri Supreme Court issued a stay, blocking his freedom. His wife was en route to pick him up.


St. Louis Circuit Judge Jason Sengheiser's decision to release Dunn came after he overturned Dunn's murder conviction Monday, citing evidence of "actual innocence" in the 1990 killing. He ordered Dunn's immediate release then, but Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey appealed, and the state Department of Corrections declined to release him.


St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore filed a motion Wednesday urging the judge to immediately order Dunn's freedom.


"The attorney general cannot unilaterally decide to ignore this court's order," Gore wrote.




A court filing said an attorney for the Department of Corrections told a lawyer in Gore's office that Bailey advised the agency not to release Dunn until the appeal played out. When told it was improper to ignore a court order, the Department of Corrections attorney "responded that the attorney general's office is legal counsel to the DOC and the DOC would be following the advice of counsel."


On Wednesday, Sengheiser said the prison in Licking had until 6 p.m. CDT to release Dunn, or he would hold an order for the warden to be held in contempt of court.


"Barring a new court order that supersedes the current court order, Mr. Dunn will be released before 6 p.m.," Missouri Corrections Department spokeswoman Karen Pojmann said in an email to The Associated Press, later texting that she expected him to be released in about an hour.


"It shouldn't be this hard," said Dunn's attorney, Tricia Rojo Bushnell, the executive director of the Midwest Innocence Project.


'Over the moon'


Dunn's wife told the AP she couldn't believe the news.


"I'm over the moon," Kira Dunn said as she headed to the prison.


"We're so grateful to the judge. We're so grateful that he didn't allow his ruling to be disrespected that way and he put his foot down and said, 'You will respect the rule of law and you will respect a court order.' "


She said her husband looks forward to being freed after decades of longing to embrace his family for as long as he wants and having "a say in his own life."


"He wants to just feel free ground against his feet. He wants to walk barefoot. He wants to open and close doors as he chooses. He wants to select the temperature of his shower. He wants to go out in the middle of the night and look at the stars and just sit there. And, he wants to sleep in a real bed," she said.


Dunn's situation is similar to what happened to Sandra Hemme.


The 64-year-old woman spent 43 years in prison for the fatal stabbing of a woman in St. Joseph in 1980. A judge on June 14 cited evidence of "actual innocence" and overturned her conviction. She had been the longest-held wrongly incarcerated woman known in the U.S., according to the National Innocence Project, which worked to free Hemme.




But appeals by Bailey — all the way up to the Missouri Supreme Court — kept Hemme imprisoned at the Chillicothe Correctional Center. During a court hearing Friday, Judge Ryan Horsman said that if Hemme wasn't released within hours, Bailey himself would have to appear in court with contempt of court on the table. She was released later that day.


Judicial scolding


The judge also scolded Bailey's office for calling the Chillicothe warden and telling prison officials not to release Hemme after he ordered her to be freed on her own recognizance.


Dunn was convicted of first-degree murder in the 1990 shooting of Ricco Rogers, 15. Gore's office examined the case and filed a motion in February seeking to vacate the guilty verdict.


After weighing the case for nearly two months, Sengheiser issued a ruling that cited "a clear and convincing showing of 'actual innocence' that undermines the basis for Dunn's convictions, because in light of new evidence, no juror, acting reasonably, would have voted to find Dunn guilty of these crimes beyond a reasonable doubt."


Lawyers for Bailey's office said at the hearing that initial testimony from two boys at the scene who identified Dunn as the shooter was correct, even though they recanted as adults.


A Missouri law adopted in 2021 lets prosecutors request hearings when they see evidence of a wrongful conviction. Although Bailey's office is not required to oppose such efforts, he also did so at a hearing for Lamar Johnson, who spent 28 years in prison for murder. Another St. Louis judge ruled in February 2023 that Johnson was wrongfully convicted, and he was freed.


Another hearing begins August 21 for death row inmate Marcellus Williams. Bailey's office is opposing the challenge to Williams' conviction, too. Timing is of the essence: Williams is scheduled to be executed September 24.


St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell filed a motion in January to vacate the conviction of Williams for the fatal stabbing of Lisha Gayle in 1998. Bell's motion said three experts determined that Williams' DNA was not on the handle of the butcher knife used in the killing.


Steven Puro, professor emeritus of political science at St. Louis University, said Bailey is in a highly competitive race for the attorney general position, with the primary quickly approaching on August 6.


"Bailey is trying to show that he is 'tough on crime,' which is a very important Republican conservative position. Clearly, he's angering members of the judicial system that he will have to argue before in the future. But he's making the strategic notion that he needs to get his name before the voters and try to use that to win the primary election."


'Court has to be obeyed'


Michael Wolff, a former Missouri Supreme Court judge and chief justice, concurred with Puro's observation, saying the handling of the case appears to be influenced by politics, also noting that the primary is quickly approaching.


"Does August 6 have anything to do with it?" he asked.


"If there's a finding of actual innocence and there's no case left, then that's all," Wolff said. "Then it seems to me that it's just whatever he believes and whatever his political instincts tell him to do. But one of the things is that no matter what your beliefs are, if a court orders something to happen, it's not your purview to say no. The court has to be obeyed."

## North Korea seen unlikely to engage US after fall election, regardless of winner

date: 2024-07-24, from: VOA News USA

washington — North Korea’s broadening ties with Russia make a possible re-engagement with the U.S. less appealing for Pyongyang despite an apparent overture from Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, analysts said.


A delegation from the Russian prosecutor’s office wrapped up a three-day visit to Pyongyang and headed home Wednesday, North Korea’s state-run KCNA said.


Prosecutor General Igor Krasnov, the head of the delegation, and Kim Chol Won, director of North Korea’s Central Public Prosecutors Office, signed an agreement on Monday to cooperate on law enforcement countering foreign influence.


Krasnov said the two countries are “actively developing their comprehensive partnership” in “openly and successfully fighting off attempts to impose alien development models and values on us,” according to the Russian news agency Tass.


Krasnov said Moscow and Pyongyang seek to consolidate their efforts in countering “crimes in the area of information and communications technologies,” among other areas.


The ties between the two have been expanding rapidly in multiple areas since Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Pyongyang in June and signed a mutual defense treaty with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, promising closer military cooperation.




Russia-North Korea ties


“Kim Jong Un may see less need to engage with the U.S. than in 2018 because the regime is now getting economic and possibly military benefits from Russia,” said Bruce Klingner, senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at the Heritage Foundation.


North Korea said, “We do not care” that “any administration takes office in the U.S.” or that Trump has “lingering desire for the prospects of the DPRK-U.S. relations,” according to state-run KCNA on Tuesday.


The statement was released after Trump said last week in his presidential nomination acceptance speech at the Republic National Convention that he “got along very well with Kim” and thought Kim wanted him to win the presidential election in November.


During his term, Trump’s personal diplomacy with Kim resulted in their first 2018 summit in Singapore, a failed 2019 summit in Hanoi, and a last meeting at the inter-Korean border in 2019.


But that engagement came before Kim had Putin by his side, according to Andrew Yeo, the SK-Korea Foundation  chair in Korea studies at the Brookings Institution.  “There’s less incentive for Kim to engage with the U.S.” now that Russia and China are backing him, Yeo said.


“That said, Kim is an opportunist, so I wouldn’t rule out the possibility of Kim reaching out to Trump at some point if Trump is reelected,” Yeo added.


Little incentive for talks


In its KCNA statement, North Korea also said, “It is true that Trump, when he was president, tried to reflect the special personal relations between the heads of states in the relations between states, but he did not bring about any substantial positive change.”


Robert Manning, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center’s Reimagining U.S. Grand Strategy Program, said the KCNA statement "reflected that Kim felt humiliated when Trump walked out of the Hanoi summit rather than continuing negotiations, and the strategic choices Kim has made since 2019 — that he has abandoned long-standing North Korean interest in normalizing relations with the U.S.


“If Trump wins, he may be tempted to try to revive nuclear talks with Kim, but Pyongyang has taken denuclearization off the table. The political space for a more limited, credible U.S.-North Korea deal has shrunk immensely.”


Trump walked out of the summit in Hanoi, rejecting Kim’s offer to dismantle the Yongbyon nuclear facility in return for sanctions relief.




Nuclear talks between the U.S. and North Korea have remained stalled since 2019 despite the Biden administration's call for Pyongyang to return to dialogue.


In the same KCNA statement that rebuffed Trump’s outreach, North Korea expressed its dissatisfaction with the deployment of U.S. FA-18 Super Hornets to the Suwon Air Force Base for joint drills with South Korea that began Tuesday and will run through this summer.


Washington’s continued call for dialogue in this context is a “sinister attempt” and “an extension of confrontation,” North Korea said.


The Heritage Foundation's Klingner said North Korea's message "hinted that the price for it reengaging with Washington would be the cancellation of bilateral military exercises, rotational deployment of U.S. strategic assets and reduction of the U.S. extended deterrence guarantee.


“If Washington capitulated to those demands, Pyongyang could seek to further divide the U.S.-ROK alliance and degrade deterrence by proposing a peace declaration or treaty which could then lead to advocacy for a premature decrease of U.S. troops in South Korea.”

## Blinken heads to Asia after Thursday's meeting between Biden, Netanyahu

date: 2024-07-24, from: VOA News USA

State Department  — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will depart for Asia on Thursday to reaffirm ties with strategic allies, following his attendance at a highly anticipated White House meeting between President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.


“The secretary will now depart tomorrow for Asia, instead of tonight, as we had originally planned, so he can attend the meeting between the president and Prime Minister Netanyahu tomorrow here in Washington,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters during Wednesday's briefing.  


Washington said it is committed to allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific region, despite the Middle East crisis.  


"This is the secretary's 18th trip to the region," Miller added. "He will still travel to Laos, to Vietnam, to Japan, to Singapore, to the Philippines and to Mongolia."  


Blinken will hold talks with senior officials from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Vientiane, Laos, before traveling to Hanoi, Vietnam. Although a schedule change will prevent him from attending the funeral of General Secretary Nguyen Phú Trong, the head of Vietnam’s ruling Communist Party, he will still visit Vietnam to pay his respects and meet with senior officials.  


In Tokyo and Manila, Blinken will join Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin for 2+2 security talks with their counterparts.   




Blinken will also travel to Singapore and Mongolia to hold talks with senior officials there.

## FBI: Would-be assassin was fixated on Trump, studied earlier high-profile killing

date: 2024-07-24, from: VOA News USA

washington  — The 20-year-old man who tried to kill former President Donald Trump during a campaign rally earlier this month appeared to have set his sights on the attempted assassination at least a week before the incident.


FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers on Wednesday that while many questions remained unanswered, analysis of a laptop connected to Thomas Matthew Crooks showed the would-be assassin seemed to be fixated on high-profile public figures and searched for information on the 1963 killing of then-U.S. President John F. Kennedy by lone gunman Lee Harvey Oswald.


“On July 6, he did a Google search for – quote – ‘how far away was Oswald from Kennedy,' ” Wray said. 


“That’s obviously significant in terms of his state of mind,” Wray added. “That is the same day that he registered for the Butler rally.”


Seven days later, on July 13, Crooks climbed onto a roof overlooking the campaign rally in western Pennsylvania and fired at least eight shots from an AR-style assault rifle, leaving Trump with a bloody ear while killing a rallygoer and injuring two others.




Crooks, who was killed by a U.S. Secret Service sniper, also carried a remote detonator for two explosive devices left in his car, though the FBI director said the receivers had not been activated and likely would not have gone off had he tried to activate them.


"What else he had in mind is something that I think is very much an open question," Wray told the House Judiciary Committee. “We'd love to have a road map that tells us exactly what he was thinking. We haven't found that yet."


What investigators have found, Wray said, is evidence that the shooter had developed a fascination with high-profile figures, using his mobile phone to get more information.


"The shooter appears to have done a lot of searches of public figures in general … news articles and things like that," Wray said, adding that images of high-profile officials and politicians found on the shooter’s phone were linked to the articles.


“This does not appear to be some sort of target list," he said. “There doesn't seem to be a lot of rhyme or reason to it so far, other than that these are all prominent public people."


By July 6, however, that fascination had morphed into a fixation.


“In the period around July 6, leading up to July 13, he does seem to have become very focused on this particular rally and former President Trump,” Wray said. “But exactly what his thought process was in doing that, that's something that's still very much under investigation.”


Other searches of the shooter’s mobile phone and electronic devices have so far not provided any additional insight into Crooks’ mindset.


Wray said the investigation had failed to turn up any evidence of a political ideology or a manifesto, nor have investigators come across any indication that the shooter had help or that he alerted anyone else to his plans.


"So far, we have not found any evidence of any accomplices or co-conspirators, foreign or domestic," Wray said, adding the investigation appeared to confirm accounts that Crooks was a loner.


“His list of contacts, for example, is very short compared to what you would normally see from most people. It doesn’t appear to be a whole lot of interaction between him, face-to-face or digital, with a lot of people,” he said. 


Still, Wray cautioned that the FBI had not been able to access all of the shooter’s social media accounts and that investigators might never get past some of the passwords and encryption.


U.S. lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats, have repeatedly expressed outrage in the days since the shooting, leading to Tuesday’s resignation of the director of the U.S. Secret Service, the agency responsible for providing security to current and former presidents and their families.




The now former director, Kimberly Cheatle, drew additional ire from lawmakers the day before she resigned, repeatedly refusing to answer questions about the attempted assassination while calling the event the “most significant operational failure … in decades.”




The FBI’s Wray on Wednesday took a different tack, assuring lawmakers that the bureau would “leave no stone unturned” in its investigation, while committing to provide as much information as possible. 


"We need to know what happened play by play, moment by moment, second by second," said Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan.


"A significant portion of the country has a healthy skepticism regarding the FBI's ability to conduct a fair, honest, open and transparent investigation," the Republican lawmaker said, accusing the law enforcement agency of what he described as multiple failures over the past several years.


During the more than three hours of testimony, the FBI’s Wray confirmed reports that the shooter had flown a drone at the site of campaign rally about two hours before the event got underway.


He said the flight path took the drone over an area about 180 meters from the stage where Trump was to speak, and that it appeared the drone livestreamed video.


However, the camera appeared to have been pointing away from the podium. 


"We think it would have shown him what would have been behind him [on the roof],” Wray said. “Like, it's almost like giving him a rear-view mirror of the scene behind him.”


Wray also said investigators had determined the shooter visited the rally site at least three times. 




The first visit, which came a week before the shooting, lasted 20 minutes. A second visit, which lasted 70 minutes, took place the morning of the shooting. And the final visit was the afternoon of the shooting, when Crooks arrived and waited to carry out the attempted assassination. 


Yet for all that investigators think they know after digging into the shooter’s social media and communications, and after more than 400 interviews, Wray said there were other questions that had yet to be answered.


One of those questions is how Crooks got up on the roof of the building overlooking the rally.


Investigators found a receipt showing he had bought a 1.5-meter ladder, but that it was never brought to the scene of the shooting.


Wray said there was also still confusion about whether the shooter had placed the rifle on the roof before the shooting or had carried it up with him right before he started firing.


“The weapon had a collapsible stock, which might explain why it was less easy to observe," Wray said, noting that the first sighting by law enforcement officers of the shooter actually holding the gun came just seconds before the first shots rang out.

## Harris was never 'border czar,' experts say, despite Republican claims

date: 2024-07-24, from: VOA News USA

washington  — After President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him as the Democratic nominee, Republicans quickly focused on Harris and her work on immigration issues, calling her a “border czar.”


Congressman Guy Reschenthaler, a Republican from Pennsylvania, said at a House Rules Committee hearing Tuesday that Biden appointed Harris as the border czar 64 days into his administration. The hearing focused on an emergency resolution addressing the "failures of the border czar position and its negative impact on our fellow citizens across the country."


“With Harris at the helm, the Biden-Harris administration made good on their promise to systematically dismantle President [Donald] Trump’s secure border [policies],” Reschenthaler said.


But was Harris appointed as border czar?


Immigration experts say no.


Theresa Cardinal Brown, senior adviser on immigration and border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said that early in the Biden administration, Harris was assigned the task of reducing migration to the U.S. southern border and collaborating with Central American nations to address the root causes of migration through diplomacy, development and investment.


“She was never named a border czar. In fact, the border was not her priority issue at all. The border was the responsibility of Homeland Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. She was never in charge of the border per se,” Brown said.


Brown said "czar" is not a recognized term under the U.S. legal system.


“But it has been adopted into American political discourse as, I’d say, a shorthand title for somebody who is given within a White House administration – within the executive branch – broad responsibility and authority to direct the administration across different Cabinet departments on a particular issue or policy,” Brown said.




Border politics


During the pandemic, the Trump administration virtually closed the border to migration, as officials implemented a health order that allowed for the rapid expulsion of migrants, effectively turning away most migrants without giving them a chance to seek asylum.


When President Biden took office in January 2021, expulsions continued, except for unaccompanied minors. Both Biden and Harris openly urged migrants not to come, but they did, presenting a political crisis for Biden at the beginning of his administration.


Biden soon asked Harris to spearhead a "root causes" strategy, banking heavily on using American investments to improve living conditions and discourage migrants from leaving three Central American nations where a significant number of migrants come from: Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.


The Biden administration also reunited families separated under the Trump administration and expanded legal immigration pathways, including increasing refugee admissions and creating a humanitarian program for migrants from Central America, Venezuela and Haiti.




Although it is not known what Harris’ immigration policy will look like, immigration attorney Hector Quiroga said he thinks Harris will continue Biden’s policies, but he noted that Harris’ immigration message has changed.


“Her record is rather interesting because in the beginning, she was very much in the diplomatic kind of way. … With experience [in the vice president office], she has said, ‘Please don’t come’ to migrants,” he said, referring to Harris’ evolution to a stricter tone and tougher message.


Quiroga is referring to Harris’ 2021 trip to Guatemala to meet with former Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei and address the root causes of illegal migration. During her visit, she emphasized the Biden administration's commitment to helping Guatemalans find "hope at home."


And she issued a stern warning to potential migrants.


“I want to be clear to folks in this region who are thinking about making that dangerous trek to the United States-Mexico border,” Harris said. “Do not come. Do not come.”


The Biden administration has been highlighting progress at the border, noting that arrests for illegal crossings from Mexico dropped by 29% in June, marking the lowest number during Joe Biden's presidency.

## The Upside of Tesla’s Decline

date: 2024-07-24, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mjk2OTA2Ni9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MTU4NjQyOX0.thEvO8nzBOl9nnvHKJ8bYY-W7wfGaHkUn8OciNGiYJI/image.png?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	Tesla, formerly the golden boy of electric vehicle manufacturers, has hit the skids. After nearly continuous sales growth for a decade, in May sales were <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/727144/us-ev-registrations-may2024/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>down 15% year-on-year</u></a> — the fourth consecutive month of decline. Profits were down fully <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/23/business/tesla-q2-earnings-elon-musk.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>45</u></a>% in the second quarter thanks to soft sales and price cuts. The only new model the company has produced in five years, the Cybertruck, has gotten weak reviews and been plagued with problems.
</p><p>
	Electrifying transportation is a vital part of combating climate change, and for years Tesla benefited from the argument that as the pioneering American EV company, it was doing great work on the climate.
</p><p>
	Declining sales aren’t good for Tesla CEO Elon Musk or the company’s shareholders. But the fact that other companies are <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/726327/ev-sales-brands-non-tesla/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>taking up the slack</u></a> — now accounting for a <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/10/tesla_electric_car_sales/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>majority of EV sales</u></a> — is good for the EV market as a whole. Here’s why.
</p><p>
	First, from a traditional business standpoint, it is good to have several competitors in a market. This is how capitalism is supposed to work — for any particular good or service, a number of different businesses should be constantly fighting each other for profits by improving their products on price and quality (within the bounds of government regulations on safety, efficiency, and so on). When there is sustained competition, old, established companies have to keep researching and innovating, lest they lose market share to someone else.
</p><p>
	We have seen this in the automobile space many times before, as when General Motors improved on Ford’s assembly line to come out with regular new models in the 1920s, or when upstart Japanese companies caught the incumbent American players flatfooted in the 1970s and 80s with small, reliable cars at a lower price. Modern cars are dramatically safer, cleaner, more reliable, and more efficient thanks in large part to this history of competition.
</p><p>
	Second, Tesla’s peculiar history makes it a poor foundation for the EV industry. The company comes out of California’s Big Tech culture, with its ideology of “move fast and break things” and deep disdain for prior experience. The result, as auto journalist Edward Neidermeyer explains in his book <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/692346/ludicrous-by-edward-niedermeyer/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Ludicrous: The Unvarnished Story of Tesla Motors</em></em></u></a>, is an unusually shoddy and dangerous manufacturing culture. Tesla’s factories are notorious for <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-german-plant-union-claims-poor-working-conditions-long-hours-2023-1?op=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>poor working conditions</u></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/21/23971138/tesla-gigafactory-austin-texas-injury-reports-robot-claw-explosion" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>regular injuries</u></a>, and its cars are infamous for inconsistent panel gaps, <a href="https://www.afr.com/technology/tesla-blamed-drivers-for-failures-of-parts-it-long-knew-were-defective-20231226-p5etok" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>structural failures</u></a>, and of course <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/26/24141361/tesla-autopilot-fsd-nhtsa-investigation-report-crash-death" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Autopilot accidents</u></a>.
</p><p>
	We can see these two factors at work in the growing number of superior options available from other EV companies. Tesla’s habit of putting as many controls as possible into a massive central screen seemed fancy at first, but drivers are starting to remember that physical buttons are both more reliable and easier to use while driving. In the economy segment, Hyundai’s Kona EV or Chevy’s Bolt EUV both have dead simple rocker switches for adjusting the temperature — no touchscreen menu fiddling required. Indeed, Tesla has even replaced such a bog standard control as the turn signal stalk with capacitive buttons in the most recent Model 3 and Model S, which is <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/2024-tesla-model-3-turn-signals-long-term-update.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>straight-up dangerous</u></a>.
</p><p>
	Even in the upmarket segments Tesla is falling behind. The new GM Silverado EV is far more of a real utility vehicle than the Cybertruck — in particular, it can <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2024/03/28/four-electric-trucks-go-head-to-head-towing-over-the-rockies/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>actually tow serious distances</u></a>. Unlike Tesla, Kia and Rivian now have three-row vehicles for big families with the EV9 and Rivian R1S. For enthusiasts, Tesla’s top-shelf Model S Plaid is very fast in a straight line, but Hyundai’s new Ioniq 5 N both <a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/reviews/a44287146/hyundai-ioniq-5-n-drive-nurburgring-autobahn/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>handles far better</u></a> and comes with a (faintly comical, yet fun) manual transmission simulation system. This is what happens when serious companies cater to as many market segments as possible.
</p><p>
	Then there is the fact that Musk seems to have turned against Tesla’s Supercharger network, which is legitimately the best in the business. That fact, along with some government subsidies and requirements, is why every other EV company has settled on the Tesla charging plug as the North American standard. But Musk recently fired almost the entire Supercharger team <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/inside-story-elon-musks-mass-firings-tesla-supercharger-staff-2024-05-15/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>apparently in a fit of pique</u></a>, and though <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/tesla-does-180-on-superchargers-rehiring-laid-off-staff-amid-new-plans/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he hired some of them back</u></a>, the system’s future is in doubt. Relying on Tesla to build out a proper national charging network is unwise.
</p><p>
	Finally, there is Elon Musk himself. Last year, <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/elon-musk-tesla-twitter" target="_self"><u>I argued</u></a> that Tesla could evolve into a normal car company if it could just be run by somebody other than him — like, for instance, then-Chief Financial Officer Zach Kirkhorn, who seemed to be running things at the time. Unfortunately, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-did-tesla-cfo-zach-210619337.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Kirkhorn is out</u></a>, and Musk has since taken back control. His pet project Cybertruck looks to be a flop, and he’s reportedly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/wall-street-wants-answers-musk-teslas-affordable-car-2024-04-17/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>canceled</u></a> the $25,000 model that was supposed to be the end goal of Tesla’s entire business plan (though Musk denies this). Instead he is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/05/business/elon-musk-tesla-robotaxi-august-8/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pivoting back to robotaxis</u></a> — which, if year after year of <a href="https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-robotaxi-promise-broken-august-8-tesla-day-1851392219" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>broken promises</u></a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-video-promoting-self-driving-was-staged-engineer-testifies-2023-01-17/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>misleading promotions</u></a> are any judge — is not going to happen.
</p><p>
	More importantly, Musk has harnessed his vast fortune—which is mostly Tesla stock—on behalf of Donald Trump. Musk promised to donate <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/15/elon-musk-45-million-donation-trump-super-pac/74418715007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$45 million per month</u></a> for the rest of the presidential campaign (though he <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/07/23/elon-musk-backs-down-from-45-million-a-month-pledge-to-trump-says-he-doesnt-subscribe-to-cult-of-personality/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>later walked back</u></a> that specific figure). A second Trump presidency will probably not end the EV transition—all the world’s big automakers have bet heavily on it—but it might dramatically slow it down in this country. Trump has <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/02/26/1088921/trump-wants-to-unravel-bidens-landmark-climate-law-here-is-whats-most-at-risk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>promised to repeal</u></a> the Inflation Reduction Act, which would end the $7,500 tax credit for EV purchases, not to mention the hundreds of billions in other subsidies for renewable power, utility-scale batteries, and much more. This would be a catastrophe for the climate and the American economy, which will lose out on the industries of the future to China and Europe.
</p><p>
	Indeed, it could be that Musk sees his company can’t compete with the traditional manufacturers on quality or price, and so is hoping to strangle their EV divisions by cutting off their subsidies before they’ve reached profitability, so that Tesla remains the only big player in a much smaller market.
</p><p>
	In doing so, he might hamstring all kinds of forthcoming EV innovations — from more energy-dense <a href="https://www.rideapart.com/news/727370/solid-state-ev-batteries-coming-soon-motorcycles/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>solid-state batteries</u></a>, to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/13/23024041/mercedes-benz-vision-eqxx-ev-distance-battery-charge-test" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hyper-efficient</u></a> new models, to using one’s car as a <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/02/07/1087836/how-virtual-power-plants-are-shaping-tomorrows-energy-system/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>virtual power plant</u></a>, to who knows what else. (Although to be fair Chinese companies will surely figure these out sooner or later, even if Americans can’t buy them.)
</p><p>
Whatever the case, the fact that every new Tesla purchase or lease is now effectively an in-kind donation to the Trump campaign blows up any claim Musk has to be doing good on climate change, and makes buying one grossly irresponsible for the climate. The quicker this company loses its <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tesla-egregiously-overvalued-amid-transition-150929181.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ludicrously overvalued</u></a> stock price, the better.

## Man who attacked author Salman Rushdie charged with supporting terrorist group

date: 2024-07-24, from: VOA News USA

Buffalo, New York — A man who severely injured author Salman Rushdie in a frenzied knife attack in western New York faces new terrorism charges.


A three-count indictment unsealed in U.S. District Court in Buffalo on Wednesday charges Hadi Matar with attempting to provide material support to Hezbollah, a militant group based in Lebanon and backed by Iran. The indictment didn't detail what evidence linked Matar to the group. It also includes charges of committing terrorism transcending national boundaries and providing material support to terrorists.


The federal charges come after Matar earlier this month rejected an offer by state prosecutors to recommend a shorter prison sentence if he agreed to plead guilty in Chautauqua County Court, where he is charged with attempted murder and assault. The agreement also would have required him to plead guilty to a federal terrorism-related charge, which hadn't been filed yet at the time.


Instead, both cases will now proceed to trial separately. Jury selection in the state case is set for Oct. 15.


Matar was scheduled to appear on the new indictment Wednesday afternoon.


"Mr. Matar plans on denying the accusations in the indictment," his attorney, Nathaniel Barone, said by phone. "He plans on proceeding with a vigorous defense and maintain his innocence."


Matar, 26, has been held without bail since the 2022 attack, during which he stabbed Rushdie more than a dozen times as the acclaimed writer was onstage about to give a lecture at the Chautauqua Institution. Knife wounds blinded Rushdie in one eye. The event moderator, Henry Reese, was also wounded.


Rushdie detailed the attack and his long and painful recovery in a memoir published in April.


The author spent years in hiding after the Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran issued a fatwa, or edict, in 1989 calling for Rushdie's death over his novel "The Satanic Verses." Khomeini considered the book blasphemous. Rushdie reemerged into the public the late 1990s.


Matar was born in the U.S. but holds dual citizenship in Lebanon, where his parents were born. He lived in New Jersey prior to the attack. His mother has said that her son became withdrawn and moody after he visited his father in Lebanon in 2018.


The attack raised questions about whether Rushdie had gotten proper security protection, given that he is still the subject of death threats. A state police trooper and county sheriff's deputy had been assigned to the lecture. In 1991, a Japanese translator of "The Satanic Verses" was stabbed to death. An Italian translator survived a knife attack the same year. In 1993, the book's Norwegian publisher was shot three times but survived.


The investigation into Rushdie's stabbing focused partly on whether Matar had been acting alone or in concert with militant or religious groups.

## You can contribute to KDE with non-C++ code

date: 2024-07-24, from: OS News

Not everything made by KDE uses C++. This is probably obvious to some people, but it’s worth mentioning nevertheless. And I don’t mean this as just “well duh, KDE uses QtQuick which is written with C++ and QML”. I also don’t mean this as “well duh, Qt has a lot of bindings to other languages”. I mean explicitly “KDE has tools written primarily in certain languages and specialized formats”. ↫ Thiago Sueto If you ever wanted to contribute to KDE but weren&#8217;t sure if your preferred programming language or tools were relevant, this is a great blog post detailing how you can contribute if you are familiar with any of the following: Python, Ruby, Perl, Containerfile/Docker/Podman, HTML/SCSS/JavaScript, Web Assembly, Flatpak/Snap, CMake, Java, and Rust. A complex, large project like KDE needs people with a wide variety of skills, so it&#8217;s definitely not just C++. An excellent place to start.

## Why the Vineyard Wind Blade Broke

date: 2024-07-24, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mjk2Nzk5Mi9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1ODc1NzYzNH0.yiofVKu0DOZEjxWRc62srj-HFcwelA85zFsBuVqIIvU/image.png?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/><p>The blade that <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/vineyard-wind-turbine-nantucket" target="_self"><u>snapped off an offshore turbine</u></a> at the Vineyard Wind project in Massachusetts on July 13 broke due to a manufacturing defect, according to GE Vernova, the turbine maker and installer. </p><p>During GE’s second quarter earnings call on Wednesday, CEO Scott Strazik and Vice President of Investor Relations Michael Lapides said there was no indication of a design flaw in the blade. Rather, the company has identified a “material deviation” at one of its factories in Gaspé, Canada. </p><p>“Because of that, we're going to use our existing data and re-inspect all of the blades that we have made for offshore wind,” Strazik told investors, adding that the factory has produced about 150 blades total.  </p><p>Company executives shared more details about their findings at a public meeting in Nantucket on Wednesday night. Roger Martella, GE Vernova’s chief sustainability officer, said there were two issues at play. The first was the manufacturing issue — basically, the adhesives applied to the blade to hold it together did not do their job. The second was quality control. “The inspection that should have caught this did not,” he said. “So it’s a combination of the two factors.”</p><p>Two dozen turbines have been installed as part of the Vineyard Wind project so far, with 72 blades total. GE Vernova has not responded to requests for clarification about how many of them originated at the Gaspé facility. </p><p>The re-inspection process does not involve physically inspecting each blade, Martella explained. The company takes “incredibly detailed ultrasound pictures” of every blade it produces, he said, and will be reviewing the images as “a desktop exercise.” He likened the process to getting a second, more detailed opinion from a doctor on an MRI. When asked why the company did not catch the defect the first time these scans were inspected, Martella said answering that is part of the ongoing investigation. In the meantime, blade production at the factory is on pause.</p><p>GE also stressed that the incident at Vineyard Wind was unrelated to a blade failure at the Dogger Bank wind farm in the U.K. earlier this year, which was due to an installation error. Installation has resumed at Dogger Bank.</p><p>Tensions were high at Wednesday night’s meeting, where Nantucket residents again lined up to lambast Vineyard Wind. Select Board chair Brooke Mohr opened the meeting by saying that the incident has shown the inadequacy of the <a href="https://nantucket-ma.gov/DocumentCenter/View/37347/Good-Neighbor-Agreement-PDF" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Good Neighbor Agreement</u></a>, a settlement between the town and Vineyard Wind reached in 2020. Under the agreement, the company would contribute $4 million to a community fund and take steps to minimize visual impacts of the wind farm. In return, the town would “convey support” for the project to the community and to state and federal officials. Mohr said the town now intends to renegotiate these terms. “The Select Board is committed to holding vineyard wind and GE, the manufacturer of the turbine blades, accountable,” she said.</p><p>Town representatives are going to meet with Vineyard Wind next week to negotiate compensation for the costs it has incurred as a result of the accident.</p><p>Meanwhile, on the ground and in the water around Nantucket, crews from Vineyard Wind and GE <a href="https://nantucket-ma.gov/3176/Week-2-July-22---28" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>continued to collect blade debris</u></a> on Wednesday morning, for the ninth day straight. An initial <a href="https://nantucket-ma.gov/DocumentCenter/View/48366/Vineyard-Wind-CSM---7-23-2024-FINAL-for-Distribution-PDF" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>environmental assessment</u></a> of the blade debris published late Tuesday night began to answer key questions about the risks all that debris poses to people and marine life.</p><p>The report was commissioned by GE and conducted by Arcadis US, an engineering and environmental consultancy. It asserts that the primary risk to people is injury from the sharp edges of fiberglass fragments and that the debris “are considered inert, non-soluble, stable, and nontoxic.” </p><p>It also cautions, however, that further evaluation will be required to understand the risks posed by any blade materials that remain in the environment, such as assessing the potential for degradation. At the meeting in Nantucket on Wednesday night, one resident asked whether they should be worried about eating fish or shellfish that may have ingested pieces of the blade. Jim Nuss, one of the authors of the Arcadis report, said the firm had “not considered that yet,” and that it would be “one of the future looking activities.”</p><p>One particularly concerning question has been whether the debris could discharge dangerous per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS or “forever chemicals,” into the environment. Though there are no PFAS used in the blade construction itself, the firm did identify the chemicals in “aerodynamic add-ons,” small 6 inch by 8 inch pieces of plastic that are installed on the outside of the blade to improve its efficiency that are also commonly used on airplanes, it said. </p><p>According to the report, the total amount of PFAS on one blade equals 28.2 grams, or about 0.06 pounds. To put that in perspective, the chemical company Daikin once estimated it would release roughly 200 pounds of PFAS <em><em>per day</em></em> into the wastewater at one of its paper mills, <a href="https://blogs.edf.org/health/2018/05/21/pfas-paper-mills/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according to federal filings</u></a> obtained by the Environmental Defense Fund in 2018. It’s not yet clear how many of those plastic “add-ons” made it into the ocean.</p><p>A comprehensive list of all materials that make up the blades shows that more than half, by weight, is fiberglass. The other key ingredients include carbon fiber and <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/polyester-pet-plastic-14-dioxane" target="_self"><u>PET foam</u></a>, a common construction material. “There are 33 different materials involved in the production of a turbine blade, from the most basic common household adhesives to the more complex industrial materials used to build the blade,” the report says.</p><p>An introduction to the report notes that GE is creating an inventory of the debris collected to assess how much of the blade has been recovered. The company has also hired Resolve Marine, a marine salvage firm, to aid in dismantling the remainder of the blade that’s still attached to the turbine, though it didn’t offer a timeline for this work.</p><p><em>Editor’s note: This story has been updated to reflect the events of the July 24 Nantucket Select Board meeting.</em><br/></p>

**@Liam on Linux** (date: 2024-07-24, from: Liam on Linux)

&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARRA_(computer)">ARRA</a> was the first ever Dutch computer.<br />&nbsp;<br />There's an account of its creation entitled <a href="https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/13534">9.2 Computers ontwerpen, toen</a>&nbsp;(<em>&quot;Computer Designs, then&quot;</em>)&nbsp;by the late&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carel_S._Scholten">Carel S Scholten</a>,&nbsp;but sadly for Anglophone readers it's in Dutch.<br /><br />This is a translation into English, done using ChatGPT 4o by Gavin Scott. I found it readable and fun, although I have no way to judge how accurate it is.<br /><br /><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">C.S. Scholten<br /><br /><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">In the summer of 1947, I was on vacation in Almelo. Earlier that year, on the same day as my best friend and inseparable study mate, Brain Jan Loopstra, I had successfully passed the qualifying exams in mathematics and physics. The mandatory brief introduction to the three major laboratories&mdash;the Physics Laboratory, the V.d. Waals Laboratory, and the Zeeman Laboratory&mdash;was behind us, and we were about to start our doctoral studies in experimental physics. For two years, we would be practically working in one of the aforementioned laboratories.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">One day, I received a telegram in Almelo with approximately the following content: &quot;Would you like to assist in building an automatic calculating machine?&quot; For assurance, another sentence was added: &quot;Mr. Loopstra has already agreed.&quot; The sender was &quot;The Mathematical Center,&quot; according to further details, located in Amsterdam. I briefly considered whether my friend had already confirmed my cooperation, but in that case, the telegram seemed unnecessary, so I dismissed that assumption. Both scenarios were equally valid: breaking up our long-standing cooperation (dating back to the beginning of high school) was simply unthinkable. Furthermore, the telegram contained two attractive points: &quot;automatic calculating machine&quot; and &quot;Mathematical Center,&quot; both new concepts to me. I couldn&rsquo;t deduce more than the name suggested. Since the cost of a telegram exceeded my budget, I posted a postcard with my answer and resumed my vacation activities. Those of you who have been involved in recruiting staff will, I assume, be filled with admiration for this unique example of recruitment tactics: no fuss about salary or working hours, not to mention irrelevant details like pension, vacation, and sick leave. For your reassurance, it should be mentioned that I was indeed offered a salary and benefits, which, in our eyes, were quite generous.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">I wasn't too concerned about how the new job could be combined with the mandatory two-year laboratory work. I believed that a solution had to be found for that. And a solution was found: the laboratory work could be replaced by our work at the Mathematical Center.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Upon returning to Amsterdam, I found out the following: the Mathematical Center was founded in 1946, with a goal that could roughly be inferred from its name. One of the departments was the 'Calculation Department,' where diligent young ladies, using hand calculators&mdash;colloquially known as 'coffee grinders'&mdash;numerically solved, for example, differential equations (in a later stage, so-called 'bookkeeping machines' were added to the machinery). The problems dealt with usually came from external clients. The head of the Calculation Department was Dr. ir. A. van Wijngaarden. Stories about automatic calculating machines had also reached the management of the Mathematical Center, and it was clear from the outset that such a tool&mdash;if viable&mdash;could be of great importance, especially for the Calculation Department. However, it was not possible to buy this equipment; those who wanted to discuss it had to build it themselves. Consequently, it was decided to establish a separate group under the Calculation Department, with the task of constructing an automatic calculating machine. Given the probable nature of this group&rsquo;s activities, it was somewhat an oddity within the Mathematical Center, doomed to disappear, if not after completing the first machine, then certainly once this kind of tool became a normal trade object.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">We were not the only group in the Netherlands involved in constructing calculating machines. As we later discovered, Dr. W.L. v.d. Poel had already started constructing a machine in 1946.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Our direct boss was Van Wijngaarden, and our newly formed two-man group was temporarily housed in a room of the Physics Laboratory on Plantage Muidergracht, where Prof. Clay was in charge. Our first significant act was the removal of a high-voltage installation in the room, much to the dismay of Clay, who was fond of the thing but arrived too late to prevent the disaster. Then we thought it might be useful to equip the room with some 220V sockets, so we went to Waterlooplein and returned with a second-hand hammer, pliers, screwdriver, some wire, and a few wooden (it was 1947!) sockets. I remember wondering whether we could reasonably submit the exorbitant bill corresponding to these purchases. Nonetheless, we did.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">After providing our room with voltage, we felt an unpleasant sensation that something was expected from us, though we had no idea how to start. We decided to consult the sparse literature. This investigation yielded two notable articles: one about the ENIAC, a digital (decimal) computer designed for ballistic problems, and one about a differential analyzer, a device for solving differential equations, where the values of variables were represented by continuously variable physical quantities, in this case, the rotation of shafts. The first article was abominably written and incomprehensible, and as far as we understood it, it was daunting, mentioning, for instance, 18,000 vacuum tubes, a number we were sure our employer could never afford. The second article (by V. Bush), on the other hand, was excellently written and gave us the idea that such a thing indeed seemed buildable.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Therefore, it had to be a differential analyzer, and a mechanical one at that. As we now know, we were betting on the wrong horse, but first, we didn&rsquo;t know that, and second, it didn&rsquo;t really matter. Initially, we were not up to either task simply because we lacked any electronic training. We were supposed to master electricity and atomic physics, but how a vacuum tube looked inside was known only to radio amateurs among us, and we certainly were not. Our own (preliminary) practicum contained, to my knowledge, no experiment in which a vacuum tube was the object of study, and the physics practicum for medical students (the so-called 'medical practicum'), where we had supervised for a year as student assistants, contained exactly one such experiment. It involved a rectifier, dated by colleagues with some training in archaeology to about the end of the First World War. The accompanying manual prescribed turning on the 'plate voltage' only tens of seconds after the filament voltage, and the students had to answer why this instruction was given. The answers were sometimes very amusing. One such answer I won&rsquo;t withhold from you: 'That is to give the current a chance to go around once.'<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Our first own experiment with a vacuum tube would not have been out of place in a slapstick movie. It involved a triode, in whose anode circuit we included a megohm resistor for safety. Safely ensconced behind a tipped-over table, we turned on the 'experiment.' Unlike in a slapstick movie, nothing significant happened in our case.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">With the help of some textbooks, and not to forget the 'tube manuals' of some manufacturers of these useful objects, we somewhat brushed up on our electronic knowledge and managed to get a couple of components, which were supposed to play a role in the differential analyzer, to a state where their function could at least be guessed. They were a moment amplifier and a curve follower. How we should perfect these devices so that they would work reliably and could be produced in some numbers remained a mystery to us. The solution to this mystery was never found. Certainly not by me, as around this time (January 1948), I was summoned to military service, which couldn&rsquo;t do without me. During the two years and eight months of my absence (I returned to civilian life in September 1950), a drastic change took place, which I could follow thanks to frequent contacts with Loopstra.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">First, the Mathematical Center, including our group, moved to the current building at 2nd Boerhaavestraat 49. The building looked somewhat different back then. The entire building had consisted of two symmetrically built schools. During the war, the building was requisitioned by the Germans and used as a garage. In this context, the outer wall of one of the gymnasiums was demolished. Now, one half was again in use as a school, and the other half, as well as the attic above both halves, was assigned to the Mathematical Center. The Germans had installed a munitions lift in the building. The lift was gone, but the associated lift shaft was not. Fortunately, few among us had suicidal tendencies. The frosted glass in the toilet doors (an old school!) had long since disappeared; for the sake of decorum, curtains were hung in front of them.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Van Wijngaarden could operate for a long time over a hole in the floor next to his desk, corresponding with a hole in the ceiling of the room below (unoccupied). Despite his impressive cigar consumption at that time, I didn&rsquo;t notice that this gigantic ashtray ever filled up.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">The number of employees in our group had meanwhile expanded somewhat; all in all, perhaps around five.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">The most significant change in the situation concerned our further plans. The idea of a differential analyzer was abandoned as it had become clear that the future belonged to digital computers. Upon my return, a substantial part of such a computer, the 'ARRA' (Automatische Relais Rekenmachine Amsterdam), had already been realized. The main components were relays (for various logical functions) and tubes (for the flip-flops that composed the registers). The relays were Siemens high-speed relays (switching times in the order of a few milliseconds), personally retrieved by Loopstra and Van Wijngaarden from an English war surplus. They contained a single changeover contact (break-before-make), with make and break contacts rigidly set, although adjustable. Logically appealing were the two separate coils (with an equal number of windings): both the inclusive and exclusive OR functions were within reach. The relays were mounted on octal bases by us and later enclosed in a plastic bag to prevent contact contamination.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">They were a constant source of concern: switching times were unreliable (especially when the exclusive OR was applied) and contact degradation occurred nonetheless. Cleaning the contacts ('polishing the pins') and resetting the switching times became a regular pastime, often involving the girls from the Calculation Department. The setting was done on a relay tester, and during this setting, the contacts were under considerable voltage. Although an instrument with a wooden handle was used for setting, the curses occasionally uttered suggested it was not entirely effective.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">For the flip-flops, double triodes were used, followed by a power tube to drive a sufficient number of relays, and a pilot lamp for visual indication of the flip-flop state. Since the A had three registers, each 30 bits wide, there must have been about 90 power tubes, and we noted with dismay that 90 power tubes oscillated excellently. After some time, we knew exactly which pilot lamp socket needed a 2-meter wire to eliminate the oscillation.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">At a later stage, a drum (initially, the instructions were read from a plugboard via step switches) functioned as memory; for input and output, a tape reader (paper, as magnetic tape was yet to be invented) and a teleprinter were available. A wooden kitchen table served as the control desk.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Relays and tubes might have been the main logical building blocks, but they were certainly not the only ones. Without too much exaggeration, it can be said that the ARRA was a collection of what the electronic industry had to offer, a circumstance greatly contributed to by our frequent trips to Eindhoven, from where we often returned with some 'sample items.' On the train back, we first reminisced about the excellent lunch we had enjoyed and then inventoried to determine if we brought back enough to cover the travel expenses. This examination usually turned out positive.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">It should be noted that the ARRA was mainly not clocked. Each primitive operation was followed by an 'operation complete' signal, which in turn started the next operation. It is somewhat amusing that nowadays such a system is sometimes proposed again (but hopefully more reliable than what we produced) to prevent glitch problems, a concept we were not familiar with at the time.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">Needless to say, the ARRA was so unreliable that little productive work could be done with it. However, it was officially put into use. By mid-1952, this was the case. His Excellency F.J. Th. Rutten, then Minister of Education, appeared at our place and officially inaugurated the ARRA with some ceremony. For this purpose, we carefully chose a demonstration program with minimal risk of failure, namely producing random numbers &agrave; la Fibonacci. We had rehearsed the demonstration so often that we knew large parts of the output sequence by heart, and we breathed a sigh of relief when we found that the machine produced the correct output. In hindsight, I am surprised that this demonstration did not earn us a reprimand from higher-ups. Imagine: you are the Minister of Education, thoroughly briefed at the Department about the wonders of the upcoming computing machines; you attend the official inauguration, and you are greeted by a group explaining that, to demonstrate these wonders, the machine will soon produce a series of random numbers. When the moment arrives, they tell you with beaming faces that the machine works excellently. I would have assumed that, if not with the truth, at least with me, they were having a bit of fun. His Excellency remained friendly, a remarkable display of self-control.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">The emotions stirred by this festivity were apparently too much for the ARRA. After the opening, as far as I recall, no reasonable amount of useful work was ever produced. After some time, towards the end of 1952, we decided to give up the ARRA as a hopeless case and do something else. There was another reason for this decision. The year 1952 should be considered an excellent harvest year for the Mathematical Center staff: in March and November of that year, Edsger Dijkstra and Gerrit Blaauw respectively appeared on the scene. Of these two, the latter is of particular importance for today's story and our future narrative. Gerrit had worked on computers at Harvard, under the supervision of Howard Aiken. He had also written a dissertation there and was willing to lend his knowledge and insight to the Mathematical Center. We were not very compliant boys at that time. Let me put it this way: we were aware that we did not have a monopoly on wisdom, but we found it highly unlikely that anyone else would know better. Therefore, the 'newcomer' was viewed with some suspicion. Gerrit&rsquo;s achievement was all the greater when he convinced us in a lecture of the validity of what he proposed. And that was quite something: a clocked machine, uniform building blocks consisting of various types of AND/OR gates and corresponding amplifiers, pluggable (and thus interchangeable) units, a neat design method based on the use of two alternating, separate series of clock pulses, and proper documentation.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">We were sold on the plan and got to work. A small difficulty had to be overcome: what we intended to do was obviously nothing more or less than building a new machine, and this fact encountered some political difficulties. The solution to this problem was simple: formally, it would be a 'revision' of the ARRA. The new machine was thus also called ARRA II (we shall henceforth speak of A II), but the double bottom was perfectly clear to any visitor: the frames of the two machines were distinctly separated, with no connecting wire between them.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">For the AND/OR gates, we decided to use selenium diodes. These usually arrived in the form of selenium rectifiers, a sort of firecrackers of varying sizes, which we dismantled to extract the individual rectifier plates, about half the diameter of a modern-day dime. The assembly&mdash;the selenium plates couldn't tolerate high temperatures, so soldering was out of the question&mdash;was as follows: holes were drilled in a thick piece of pertinax. One end of the hole was sealed with a metal plug; into the resulting pot hole went a spring and a selenium plate, and finally, the other end of the hole was also sealed with a metal plug. For connecting the plugs, we thought the use of silver paint was appropriate, and soon we were busy painting our first own circuits. Some time later, we had plenty of reasons to curse this decision. The reliability of these connections was poor, to put it mildly, and around this time, the 'high-frequency hammer' must have been invented: we took a small hammer with a rubber head and rattled it along the handles of the units, like a child running its hand along the railings of a fence. It proved an effective means to turn intermittent interruptions into permanent ones. I won't hazard a guess as to how many interruptions we introduced in this way. At a later stage, the selenium diodes were replaced by germanium diodes, which were simply soldered.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">The AND/OR gates were followed by a triode amplifier and a cathode follower. ARRA II also got a drum and a tape reader. For output, an electric typewriter was installed, with 16 keys operable by placing magnets underneath them. The decoding tree for these magnets provided us with the means to build an echo-check, and Dijkstra fabricated a routine where, simultaneously with printing a number, the same number (if all went well) was reconstructed. I assume we thus had one of the first fully controlled print routines. Characteristic of ARRA II&rsquo;s speed was the time for an addition: 20 ms (the time of a drum rotation).<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">ARRA II came into operation in December 1953, this time without ministerial assistance, but it performed significantly more useful work than its predecessor, despite the technical difficulties outlined above.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">The design phase of ARRA II marks for me the point where computer design began to become a profession. This was greatly aided by the introduction of uniform building blocks, describable in a multidimensional binary state space, making the use of tools like Boolean algebra meaningful. We figured out how to provide ARRA II with signed multiplicative addition for integers (i.e., an operation of the form (A,S) := (M) * (&plusmn;S') + (A), for all sign combinations of (A), (S), and (M) before and of the result), despite the fact that ARRA II had only a counter as wide as a register. As far as I can recall, this was the first time I devoted a document to proving that the proposed solution was correct. Undoubtedly, the proof was in a form I would not be satisfied with today, but still... It worked as intended, and you can imagine my amusement when, years later, I learned from a French book on computers that this problem was considered unsolvable.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">In May 1954, work began on a (slightly modified) copy of ARRA II, the FERTA (Fokker's First Calculating Machine Type A), intended for Fokker. The FERTA was handed over to Fokker in April 1955. This entire affair was mainly handled by Blaauw and Dijkstra. Shortly thereafter, Blaauw left the service of the Mathematical Center.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">In June 1956, the ARMAC (Automatic Calculating Machine Mathematical Center), successor to ARRA II, was put into operation, several dozen times faster than its predecessor. Design and construction took about 1&frac12; years. Worth mentioning is that the ARMAC first used cores, albeit on a modest scale (in total 64 words of 34 bits each, I believe). For generating the horizontal and vertical selection currents for these cores, we used large cores. To drive these large cores, however, they had to be equipped with a coil with a reasonable number of windings. Extensive embroidery work didn&rsquo;t seem appealing to us, so the following solution was devised: a (fairly deep) rim was turned from transparent plastic. Thus, we now had two rings: the rim and the core. The rim was sawed at one place, and the flexibility of the material made it possible to interlock the two rings. Then, the coil was applied to the rim by rotating it from the outside using a rubber wheel. The result was a neatly wound coil. The whole thing was then encased in Araldite. The unintended surprising effect was that, since the refractive indices of the plastic and Araldite apparently differed little, the plastic rim became completely invisible. The observer saw a core in the Araldite with a beautifully regularly wound coil around it. We left many a visitor in the dark for quite some time about how we produced these things!<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">The time of amateurism was coming to an end. Computers began to appear on the market, and the fact that our group, which had now grown to several dozen employees, did not really belong in the Mathematical Center started to become painfully clear to us. Gradual dissolution of the group was, of course, an option, but that meant destroying a good piece of know-how. A solution was found when the Nillmij, which had been automating its administration for some time using Bull punch card equipment, declared its willingness to take over our group as the core of a new Dutch computer industry. Thus it happened. The new company, N.V. Elektrologica, was formally established in 1956, and gradually our group&rsquo;s employees were transferred to Elektrologica, a process that was completed with my own transfer on January 1, 1959. As the first commercial machine, we designed a fully transistorized computer, the XI, whose prototype performed its first calculations at the end of 1957. The speed was about ten times that of the ARMAC.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">With this, I consider the period I had to cover as concluded. When I confront my memories with the title of this lecture, it must be said that 'designing computers' as such hardly existed: the activities that could be labeled as such were absorbed in the total of concerns that demanded our attention. Those who engaged in constructing calculating machines at that time usually worked in very small teams and performed all the necessary tasks. We decided on the construction of racks, doors, and closures, the placement of fans (the ARMAC consumed 10 kW!), we mounted power distribution cabinets and associated wiring, we knew the available fuses and cross-sections of electrical cables by heart, we soldered, we peered at oscillographs, we climbed into the machine armed with a vacuum cleaner to clean it, and, indeed, sometimes we were also involved in design.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">We should not idealize. As you may have gathered from the above, we were occasionally brought to the brink of despair by technical problems. Inadequate components plagued us, as did a lack of knowledge and insight. This lack existed not only in our group but globally the field was not yet mastered.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">However, it was also a fascinating time, marked by a constant sense of 'never before seen,' although that may not always have been literally true. It was a time when organizing overtime, sometimes lasting all night, posed no problem. It was a time when we knew a large portion of the participants in international computer conferences at least by sight!<o:p></o:p></p><br type="_moz" /><br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=91041" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments

## This Is the Best Permitting Reform Deal We’re Going to Get

date: 2024-07-24, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mjk2NjY2My9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczODI4NDYxNH0.6IACdedHJD1qYmFie243-XcG9DDxWKZC-x_sNTBX0wA/image.png?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">We now know what a real bipartisan permitting overhaul could look like. </p><p>Senators Joe Manchin and John Barrasso on Monday unveiled the <a href="https://www.energy.senate.gov/2024/7/manchin-barrasso-release-bipartisan-energy-permitting-reform-legislation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Energy Permitting Reform Act</u></a>, the product of months of negotiations over how to craft a sweeping change to the nation’s federal energy project approvals system that could actually pass through Congress. It’s got a little bit of everything: For the oil and gas folks, there’s mandatory offshore oil and gas lease sales and streamlined permitting requirements; for renewables, there’s faster permits for “low-impact” construction jobs and new deployment goals; for transmission, there’s siting authority for interstate lines, compulsory interregional planning, and clarity on cost allocation. There are also sections devoted to helping mining projects navigate legal uncertainties around mill sites and assistance for hydropower projects needing extended licenses. Lastly there’s a fresh limit on the length of time allowed for legal challenges against energy projects of all types. </p><p>In other words, it’s an energy smorgasbord, and all sorts of fuels and resources are invited to the party. </p><p>Will such a bill be able to sail through Congress in the middle of a close election cycle? Unclear, but highly doubtful. Will it be able to overcome opposition from the major environmental groups — Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and Earthjustice — that stymied Manchin’s prior permitting deal? We have yet to hear from President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, or congressional Democratic leaders on whether they support the bill, and representatives for the White House and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer did not respond to requests for comment. </p><p>But to the people most deeply invested in bipartisan permitting compromise, none of that matters — for now, at least. In their view, this bill sets the parameters for whatever permitting deal will eventually become law, whether that’s in this Congress or the next. </p><p>“Some of the environmental community is going to look at this and see it as a net win for climate change, and some in the environmental community are more anti-fossil fuel than they are pro-reducing emissions, and so it’s harder for them to get over the fossil fuel aspect of the bill,” Xan Fishman, senior director of the energy program at the Bipartisan Policy Center, told me. “But to some extent, that’s how bipartisan deals come together. Not everyone is going to be happy.”</p><p>The biggest gain for energy transition advocates is plainly the transmission language. Since the Inflation Reduction Act (which also similarly frustrated environmental groups with its giveaways to oil and gas) became law, it has been <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/permitting-reform-transmission-nepa-geothermal" target="_self"><u>painfully apparent</u></a> that easing the federal permitting burden on transmission could speed up the deployment of renewables projects boosted by the climate law. But Republicans have so far been unwilling to consider advancing transmission support on its own, in which case the Beltway Elite conventional wisdom calls for sweetening the deal with measures that benefit fossil fuels. </p><p>Agencies have already tried to advance permitting assistance sans new legislation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has advanced a <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/ferc-transmission-planning-rule" target="_self"><u>potential fix</u></a> to regional transmission planning via Order 1920, and the Interior Department has <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-proposes-rule-bolster-solar-and-wind-development-public-lands" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>moved forward</u></a> with regulation to ease permitting burdens on solar and wind projects. Congress has also moved piecemeal solutions to sector-specific problems, such as the <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/advance-act-fusion" target="_self"><u>ADVANCE Act</u></a>, which provided federal officials with new legal resources to process cutting-edge nuclear projects. But these have not achieved anything close to the broad changes that industry representatives say are needed for the overall permitting regime. </p><p>Fishman and other observers in D.C. expect Manchin to try and move the bill out of his Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee imminently, but it’s best shot of seeing the floor won’t come until after the election, during the so-called “lame duck” session. They’re also expecting more permitting proposals out of a different committee, Senate Environment and Public Works, which has key jurisdiction over activities of the Environmental Protection Agency. Manchin couldn’t touch those because they don’t fall under the remit of his committee, but advocates for a deal believe EPA language would help relieve more of the burden projects face. </p><p>Yet with some <a href="https://x.com/SenatorHick/status/1815803108217246109" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate Democrats</u></a> coming out in support of the bill already, those seeking a permitting deal say the immediate odds for the Manchin-Barrasso bill enactment into law are not at all the point. What matters is that we now have a real life example of what a true blue bipartisan compromise on permitting that advances the energy transition can look like. </p><p>“Even if this doesn’t pass, this is the baseline for conversations,” Ryan Fitzpatrick of Third Way told me. “This is a net win for climate … it’s the starting point, however it may be adapted.”</p>

## On goals, online projects, and the usefulness of money

date: 2024-07-24, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>I’m currently a <em>“<a href="https://getkirby.com/partners">Certified Kirby Partner</a>”</em>. Fancy title, I know. What that means is that I paid some money, last summer, to be listed on a website. This upcoming August, I will no longer be a <em>“Certified Kirby Partner”</em> because I am not going to pay money—again—to be listed on a website. But my certified status is not what I want to write about. It’s just an excuse to talk about the role money plays in achieving goals in the context of online projects.</p>
<p>Most online projects exist to fulfil a goal. Sometimes that goal is stated, sometimes it’s implied. And money may or may not be an aid in achieving said goal. I was chatting about online communities with <a href="https://kevquirk.com/blog">Kev</a> the other day and we both reached the same conclusion that in order to create something meaningful in that space it has to be a paid product. Not because you need that to make it sustainable financially but because a monetary commitment—even a small one—is a helpful tool to find people who are genuinely interested in what you’re creating. You’re not likely to spend money on something you don’t care about. So in that context, money is a helpful tool to achieve the goal of creating a small community of people who care about the shared space.</p>
<p>That same way of reasoning wouldn’t make sense for something like my <a href="https://peopleandblogs.com">People and Blogs</a> series. My goal with that project is to help as many people as possible rediscover the beauty of having a personal blog and owning your corner of the web, and to encourage a healthier way to live online. Making it a paid series wouldn’t help me reach that goal. It would probably be an obstacle. This is why I started the series knowing it was going to be a cost for me both in terms of time and in terms of actual money but it was one I was willing to sustain because I believe it’s important.</p>
<p>It’s easy for me to commit to paying money when stated goals and monetisation schemes are aligned. To bring it back to Kirby, I absolutely love it both as a tool and as a project. It’s been run fantastically for more than a decade by a great group of people and I have nothing but positive things to say about it. I plan to keep using it and buying licenses for as long as they stay in business. But it’s also why I won’t pay again to be a <em>“Certified Kirby Partner”</em>. Because there the stated goals and the monetisation scheme are not aligned. As they say, money talks.</p>                <hr>

## US links Pakistan's economic growth to political stability

date: 2024-07-24, from: VOA News USA

ISLAMABAD — The United States urged Pakistan Wednesday to protect the rights of all citizens, including freedom of expression and assembly, as a military-backed crackdown on the opposition party of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan continues.


Donald Blome, the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, stressed during a seminar in Islamabad that upholding constitutionally guaranteed rights is crucial to the country’s economic progress.


“Protecting human rights for all is not just a fundamental pillar of a democracy; it’s a critical component of a vibrant and stable society drawing on the talents and contributions of all its citizens for the country’s benefits,” Blome said.


“Without such stability, the prospects for investment and economic growth appear far less certain,” he noted, without directly naming Pakistani political stakeholders.




The U.S. ambassador’s remarks came as Pakistan faces prolonged political turmoil stemming from Khan’s removal from power in 2022 through a parliamentary no-confidence vote and his subsequent imprisonment last August, which the United Nations described as having no legal basis.


The ongoing crackdown has led to the arrest of hundreds of supporters of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or PTI, party, including women.


This week, police raided the PTI’s headquarters in the Pakistani capital, detaining its chief spokesman and several other media team professionals, accusing them of running an “anti-state campaign.”


Khan’s aides have denounced the arrests as part of a campaign of suppression and intimidation.




Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s coalition government, struggling to address Pakistan’s deep economic problems, has publicly stated its intention to ban the party over charges of anti-state activities and maligning the military.


“We will, under no circumstances, tolerate such actions against our motherland, innocent people, or the armed forces of Pakistan,” Sharif reiterated Wednesday, while presiding over a cabinet meeting.


The threat of banning the country’s most popular and the single largest party in parliament has further fueled political tensions.


On Tuesday, during a congressional hearing in Washington, the crackdown and potential banning of the Pakistani opposition party also came under discussion when Donald Lu, the U.S. assistant secretary of state, was responding to questions from lawmakers.


Democratic Congressman Brad Sherman, a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, raised the issue of Pakistan banning Khan from holding public office and preventing his party from using its iconic cricket bat symbol on the ballots in the February 8 vote.




“The information minister and two other ministers have said that they want to ban the PTI. And we see in the latest development that the PTI office has been sealed, their national information security and many women have been arrested,” Sherman said.


“The best thing you can do is ask Ambassador Blome to go visit Imran Khan in prison, and I wonder if you would consider that,” the congressmen told Lu. “We’ll definitely discuss it with Ambassador Blome,” responded the assistant secretary of state.


"Pakistan’s future must be decided by its people. It's clear that the PTI is Pakistan's most popular party. I disagree with Imran Khan on many things, but it's the right of Pakistan's people to choose their leader,” Sherman wrote on his social media X platform after the hearing.




Khan’s arrest last year sparked violent street protests in Pakistan, with some of his supporters attacking facilities linked to the country’s powerful military.


The Sharif government and the military used the riots to defend the crackdown on the PTI and as a reason to keep Khan in prison after several of his convictions in other cases were recently overturned by appeals courts for lack of evidence.


Earlier this week, the Supreme Court ruled that the PTI was eligible for around two dozen extra reserved seats in parliament, saying the Election Commission of Pakistan deprived the party of them in breach of the constitution.


Once implemented, the verdict will further strengthen the PTI in the parliament and weaken the ruling coalition. It has also given credence to the opposition and independent monitors' allegations that the February 8 elections were rigged in favor of pro-military parties and prevented the PTI from sweeping the polls.


Khan, 71, rejects all charges against him — ranging from corruption to sedition and a fraudulent marriage — as politically motivated and part of a larger effort by the military to keep him and his party from returning to power.


The former cricket hero turned politician insists on the return of his party's "stolen mandate" or new elections overseen by an impartial election commission.


Sharif, who has the backing of the military, denies his government is unfairly targeting Khan and his party, saying it was determined to bring to justice those responsible for the May 2023 attacks on military facilities.


Last month, the U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted 368-7 to approve a resolution urging “the full and independent investigation of claims of interference or irregularities” in Pakistan’s election, a move Islamabad rejected.

## Whale surfaces, capsizes fishing boat off New Hampshire coast

date: 2024-07-24, from: VOA News USA

RYE, New Hampshire — Two fishermen are safe after a whale crashed onto their boat, capsizing it off the New Hampshire shore, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. 


The incident occurred Tuesday near Odiorne Point State Park in Rye. The two men, who were thrown overboard, said they had seen the whale earlier and were trying to keep their distance. 


“He went under, he disappeared for a few minutes, and then the next thing we know, he just popped right up on our transom,” fisherman Ryland Kenney told WMUR-TV. 


The Coast Guard posted to social media platform X that they had received a mayday call stating that a 7-meter center console boat had turned over because of a whale breach. 


“The occupants were ejected from the vessel as the boat capsized,” the Coast Guard posted, adding that an urgent marine information broadcast was issued, and the Coast Guard Station Portsmouth Harbor was alerted. 


“A good Samaritan recovered both individuals from the water. No injuries were reported,” the Coast Guard posted. 


The rescuers were two young brothers. 


“I saw it come up, and I was just like, ‘Oh, it’s going to hit the boat,’” Wyatt Yager told the station. “It started to flip.” His brother, Colin Yager, caught what happened on his phone. 


The boat crew from Station Portsmouth reported that the whale appeared not to be injured. The incident was reported to the Center of Coastal Studies Marine Animal Hotline and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 


The vessel has also been salvaged. 


The whale probably did not know the boat was there, said Sara Morris of the University of New Hampshire Shoals Marine Laboratory. 


“If you look at the video really carefully, you can see that the whale has its mouth open,” she told the station. “It looks like it’s lunge feeding and actually trying to catch fish.”

## Coco Gauff to be female flag bearer for US team at Olympic opening ceremony, joining LeBron James

date: 2024-07-24, from: VOA News USA

Paris — Tennis star Coco Gauff will join LeBron James as a flag bearer for the U.S. Olympic team at Friday's opening ceremony.


Gauff, the reigning U.S. Open champion, is set to make her Olympic debut at the Paris Games and will be the first tennis athlete to carry the U.S. flag. She and James were chosen by Team USA athletes.


"I mean, for me, the Olympics is a top priority. I would say equal to the Grand Slams. I wouldn't put it above or below, just because I've never played before. This is my first time," Gauff said earlier this year. "Obviously, I always want to do well, try to get a medal."


Gauff and James, the 39-year-old leading scorer in NBA history, both compete in sports that are outside the traditional Olympic world and get attention year-round, not just every four years.




The 20-year-old Gauff made the American team for the Tokyo Games three years ago as a teenager but had to sit out those Olympics because she tested positive for COVID-19 right before she was supposed to fly to Japan.


Now Gauff, who is based in Florida, is a Grand Slam title winner in singles and doubles. She won her first major championship in New York in September, defeating Aryna Sabalenka in the singles final of the U.S. Open, then added her first Grand Slam doubles trophy at the French Open this June alongside Katerina Siniakova of the Czech Republic.


The same clay courts at Roland Garros used for the French Open will be where matches are going to be held for the Paris Olympics. The draw to set the brackets is Thursday, and play begins on Saturday.


Gauff is seeded No. 2 in singles, matching her current WTA ranking behind No. 1 Iga Swiatek of Poland, and will be among the medal favorites.


She and her usual doubles partner, Jessica Pegula, are seeded No. 1 in women's doubles. It's possible Gauff could also be entered in mixed doubles, but those pairings have not been announced yet.


"I'm not putting too much pressure on it, because I really want to fully indulge in the experience," Gauff said about her Olympics debut. "Hopefully I can have the experience multiple times in my lifetime, (but) I'll treat it as a once-in-a-lifetime experience."

## The moral bankruptcy of Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz

## IOC awards 2034 Winter Games to Utah, pushes state officials to help end investigation

date: 2024-07-24, from: VOA News USA

Paris — What was expected to be a simple coronation of Salt Lake City as the 2034 Winter Olympic host turned into complicated Olympic politics Wednesday, as the IOC pushed Utah officials to end an FBI investigation into a suspected doping coverup.


The International Olympic Committee is angry about an ongoing U.S. federal investigation of suspected doping by Chinese swimmers who were allowed to compete at the Tokyo Games despite positive drug tests. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) accepted Chinese explanations for the tests, and U.S. officials are now investigating that decision under an anti-conspiracy law passed after the Russian doping scandal at the Sochi Winter Games.


President Thomas Bach wants to make sure WADA is the sole authority on Olympic doping cases, especially with the Sumer Olympics headed to Los Angeles in 2028. The IOC added a clause to Salt Lake's host contract, demanding that local organizers - including Utah Gov. Spencer Cox - push to shut down the federal investigation or risk losing the Olympics.




Cox and others promised to lobby the U.S. president and Congress.


"We agree that if the United States does not support or violates the World Anti-Doping Federation's rules, that they can withdraw the Games from from us and from the United States, " Cox said after the announcement. "That was the only way that that we could we could guarantee that we would get the Games."


Even in the world Olympic diplomacy, it was a stunning power move to force government officials to publicly agree to do the IOC's lobbying. 


After getting the Utah contingent's agreement on the clause, the IOC formally awarded the 2034 Winter Games to Salt Lake in an 83-6 vote. 


The capital city of Utah was the only candidate after the IOC gave Salt Lake City exclusive negotiating rights last year in a fast-tracked process.


The campaign team presenting the bid on stage to IOC members included Cox, Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall and Alpine ski great Lindsey Vonn. Back home, a 3 a.m. public watch party gathered to see the broadcast from Paris.


The clause inserted into the contract requires Utah officials to to work with current and future U.S. presidents and members of Congress "to alleviate your concerns" about the federal investigation into doping.


The IOC clause allows the Olympic body to terminate Salt Lake City's deal if the authority of WADA was undermined on U.S. territory. 


WADA's role is under scrutiny for accepting a Chinese investigation that declared all 23 swimmers were contaminated by traces of a banned heart medication in a hotel kitchen. Three Chinese gold medals in the Tokyo Olympic pool were won by swimmers implicated in the case. Some are also competing in Paris next week.


The case an be investigated in the U.S. under federal legislation named for a whistleblower of Russian state doping at the 2014 Sochi Winter Games.


The IOC and WADA lobbied against passing the law, known as the Rodchenkov Act, which gives U.S. federal agencies wide jurisdiction of doping enforcement worldwide ahead of Los Angeles hosting the 2028 Summer Games.


"We will work with our members of Congress," Gov. Cox told Bach and IOC voters ahead of the 2034 vote, "we will use all the levers of power open to us to resolve these concerns."




Salt Lake City first hosted the Winter Games in 2002. That bid was hit with a bribery scandal, which led to anti-corruption reforms at the IOC.


Future U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney was brought in to clean up the Games, which went off well despite tightened security. The Games were the biggest international sports event hosted by the U.S. following the Sept. 11 attacks five months earlier.


"I am sorry for you, and for us, that this issue arose now," Bach said, addressing the Salt Lake City delegation ahead of the vote.


It is an Olympic tradition for lawmakers and even heads of state to come to an IOC meeting and plead their case to be anointed as an host city.


Russian President Vladimir Putin did it in 2007, speaking in English to secure the 2014 Winter Games for Sochi. British Prime Minister Tony Blair made a key intervention in 2005 to help win the 2012 Olympics for London. U.S. President Barack Obama's visit to Copenhagen in 2009 did not help in Chicago's losing cause for the 2016 Summer Games that went to Rio de Janeiro.


For its second turn, Salt Lake City will get almost 10 full years to prepare — the longest lead-in for a modern Winter Games — amid longer-term concerns about climate change affecting snow sports and reducing the pool of potential hosts.


Salt Lake City opted to target 2034 and so avoided potential commercial and logistical clashes with the 2028 Summer Games being hosted by Los Angeles.


It will be the fifth Winter Games in the U.S. Before Salt Lake City in 2002, there was Lake Placid in 1980 and 1932, and Squaw Valley — now known as Olympic Valley — in 1960.


In a separate decision earlier in Paris, the 2030 Winter Games was awarded — with conditions — to France for a regional project split between ski resorts in the Alps and the French Riviera city Nice.


That project needs official signoff from the national government being formed, and the Prime Minister yet to be confirmed, after recent elections called by President Emmanuel Macron. He helped present the 2030 bid Wednesday to IOC members.

## What pathways to work do immigrants without permanent legal status have?

date: 2024-07-24, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Working for cash off the books is illegal. But there are routes to work for immigrants who don&#8217;t have permission to in the U.S. as an independent contractor or by establishing a Limited Liability Company, or LLC. Today, we&#8217;ll hear from one young man who&#8217;s seeking a visa that would allow him to work — but he&#8217;s looking to start an LLC in the meantime. But first: Tesla is losing ground overseas.</p>

Musk, who endorsed Trump, established a Super PAC called the America PAC, which he said will “promote the principles that made America great in the first place.” Trump and Musk have <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/elon-musk-tesla-ev-trump-488336b5?&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9tPiDGlXvWoDjeQuCqGpK-TBxDoVpJmBAIwdB-BKBke8la5z74mM1OEFA0MRheZ5Y9XNAI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reportedly</a> been speaking by phone, with Musk trying to persuade Trump on the merits of EVs.

This gas is far more potent than carbon dioxide but doesn’t last as long in the atmosphere. The White House said the new initiative would seek to reduce N2O emissions from industry by 50% next year compared to 2020 levels as companies work to curb their own pollution. The U.S. will also try to work with China to reduce these emissions from chemical plants across both countries. Together, the U.S. and China produce about 80% of industrial N2O pollution. “If successful, the two countries could reduce greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to taking approximately 50 million automobiles off the road at a fraction of the cost of other emission reduction efforts,” <em><em>Inside Climate News </em></em><a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/23072024/biden-administration-targets-nitrous-oxide-emissions/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9tPiDGlXvWoDjeQuCqGpK-TBxDoVpJmBAIwdB-BKBke8la5z74mM1OEFA0MRheZ5Y9XNAI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p><h2>THE KICKER</h2><p>The British royal family’s Crown Estate saw <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/nv65su7t80y5/4cHI3byqnqBjSzElMsT2mM/9d67c8052d316a7915b627e0a22a7fdd/TCE_AR24_Web_FINAL.pdf?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9tPiDGlXvWoDjeQuCqGpK-TBxDoVpJmBAIwdB-BKBke8la5z74mM1OEFA0MRheZ5Y9XNAI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">profits more than double</a> over the last year, thanks largely to six offshore wind leasing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/23/world/europe/uk-royal-family-finances.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9tPiDGlXvWoDjeQuCqGpK-TBxDoVpJmBAIwdB-BKBke8la5z74mM1OEFA0MRheZ5Y9XNAI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">deals</a>.</p>

## The Real Hero of ‘Twisters’ Is Geoengineering

At moments, it almost seemed like you could <em><em>feel</em></em> our place in the great continuum of history — at once stretching backward to <a href="https://youtu.be/cXm5IN2qE-k?feature=shared&t=52" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>those who came before us</u></a> while also extending forward, onward, to those who’ve <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/glen-powell-interview-2024" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>been passed the torch</u></a>.</p>
<p>I am talking, of course, about the <em><em>Twister</em></em> sequel.</p>
<p><em><em>Twisters</em></em> touched down in theaters last Friday, nearly 30 years after its precursor was released on LaserDisc and VHS with a message from the FEMA administrator to “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1996/10/15/fema-goes-hollywood-in-path-of-twister/3718ba80-6f4d-4b72-90a5-eeefe4259b91/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>never try to outdrive a tornado</u></a>.” For Hollywood reboots and the meteorological sciences both, three decades is an eon; <em><em>Twisters</em></em>’ lead actress, Daisy Edgar-Jones, was born two years after <em><em>Twister</em></em> premiered, and while Helen Hunt’s Jo had dreamed of improving tornado warning times in the mid-1990s, the Millennial storm chasers in <em><em>Twisters </em></em>own drones and plausibly discuss snuffing out the storms entirely. (Speaking of warnings: There are spoilers ahead.)</p>
<p><em><em>Twisters</em></em> is a movie that loves science and shows its work. Director Lee Isaac Chung reportedly consulted researchers from the <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/twisters-noaa-tornado-science-behind-the-scenes" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</u></a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/weather/twisters-tornado-storm-chasers-real.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>elsewhere</u></a> to get the basic facts right, and in the opening minutes of the film, the screenplay debunks the common “one Mississippi” method of calculating a storm’s distance (in case you’re not familiar, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=848687651852546&id=126747474046571&set=a.129569323764386&locale=zh_CN" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>here’s an explanation</u></a>); casually references <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Lagrangian mechanics</u></a>; and features a memorable PSA on why you should <a href="https://community.fema.gov/ProtectiveActions/s/article/Tornado-Vehicle-Do-Not-Use-Overpass-Underpass-as-Shelter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>never use an overpass for shelter</u></a> during a tornado. <em><em>Twisters</em></em> protagonists work for, or use taxpayer-funded technologies from, NOAA, the National Weather Service, and <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/russ-vought-schedule-f#:~:text=how%20connected%20climate%20hazards%20are%20to%20the%20core%20duties%20of%20what%20the%20military%20is%20focused%20on" target="_self"><u>the military</u></a> — a particularly meaningful inclusion at a time when <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2024/07/noaa-project-2025-weather/678987/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>government-funded science is under open threat</u></a> by <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self"><u>one of the leading candidates</u></a> for highest office. </p><p>Even <em><em>Twisters</em></em>’ lack of focus on climate change is relatively accurate: While it might feel odd for there not to be an obvious <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2024/07/twisters-2024-movie-glen-powell-climate-change.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate nod</u></a> in a weather disaster movie, scientists still haven’t demonstrated <a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/is-extreme-weather-climate-change#:~:text=regional%20variability.-,Tornadoes,-Tornadoes%20are%20extremely" target="_self"><u>a strong correlation</u></a> between global warming and tornadoes. Suggesting otherwise might actually have done <em><em>more</em></em> damage to public understanding by blurring the line between a <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/summer-2024-heat-records" target="_self"><u>frightening enough reality</u></a> and Hollywood fiction in the name of topical relevance.</p>
<p>Still,<em><em> Twisters</em></em> does take some dramatic liberties.

## The Real Hero of ‘Twisters’ Is Geoengineering

At moments, it almost seemed like you could <em><em>feel</em></em> our place in the great continuum of history — at once stretching backward to <a href="https://youtu.be/cXm5IN2qE-k?feature=shared&t=52" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>those who came before us</u></a> while also extending forward, onward, to those who’ve <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/glen-powell-interview-2024" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>been passed the torch</u></a>.</p>
<p>I am talking, of course, about the <em><em>Twister</em></em> sequel.</p>
<p><em><em>Twisters</em></em> touched down in theaters last Friday, nearly 30 years after its precursor was released on LaserDisc and VHS with a message from the FEMA administrator to “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1996/10/15/fema-goes-hollywood-in-path-of-twister/3718ba80-6f4d-4b72-90a5-eeefe4259b91/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>never try to outdrive a tornado</u></a>.” For Hollywood reboots and the meteorological sciences both, three decades is an eon; <em><em>Twisters</em></em>’ lead actress, Daisy Edgar-Jones, was born two years after <em><em>Twister</em></em> premiered, and while Helen Hunt’s Jo had dreamed of improving tornado warning times in the mid-1990s, the Millennial storm chasers in <em><em>Twisters </em></em>own drones and plausibly discuss snuffing out the storms entirely. (Speaking of warnings: There are spoilers ahead.)</p>
<p><em><em>Twisters</em></em> is a movie that loves science and shows its work. Director Lee Isaac Chung reportedly consulted researchers from the <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/twisters-noaa-tornado-science-behind-the-scenes" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</u></a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/weather/twisters-tornado-storm-chasers-real.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>elsewhere</u></a> to get the basic facts right, and in the opening minutes of the film, the screenplay debunks the common “one Mississippi” method of calculating a storm’s distance (in case you’re not familiar, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=848687651852546&id=126747474046571&set=a.129569323764386&locale=zh_CN" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>here’s an explanation</u></a>); casually references <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Lagrangian mechanics</u></a>; and features a memorable PSA on why you should <a href="https://community.fema.gov/ProtectiveActions/s/article/Tornado-Vehicle-Do-Not-Use-Overpass-Underpass-as-Shelter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>never use an overpass for shelter</u></a> during a tornado. <em><em>Twisters</em></em> protagonists work for, or use taxpayer-funded technologies from, NOAA, the National Weather Service, and <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/russ-vought-schedule-f#:~:text=how%20connected%20climate%20hazards%20are%20to%20the%20core%20duties%20of%20what%20the%20military%20is%20focused%20on" target="_self"><u>the military</u></a> — a particularly meaningful inclusion at a time when <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2024/07/noaa-project-2025-weather/678987/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>government-funded science is under open threat</u></a> by <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self"><u>one of the leading candidates</u></a> for highest office. </p><p>Even <em><em>Twisters</em></em>’ lack of focus on climate change is relatively accurate: While it might feel odd for there not to be an obvious <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2024/07/twisters-2024-movie-glen-powell-climate-change.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate nod</u></a> in a weather disaster movie, scientists still haven’t demonstrated <a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/is-extreme-weather-climate-change#:~:text=regional%20variability.-,Tornadoes,-Tornadoes%20are%20extremely" target="_self"><u>a strong correlation</u></a> between global warming and tornadoes. Suggesting otherwise might actually have done <em><em>more</em></em> damage to public understanding by blurring the line between a <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/summer-2024-heat-records" target="_self"><u>frightening enough reality</u></a> and Hollywood fiction in the name of topical relevance.</p>
<p>Still,<em><em> Twisters</em></em> does take some dramatic liberties. At one point, a weaker EF1 tornado <a href="https://youtu.be/wdok0rZdmx4?feature=shared&t=67" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>breaks the blade</u></a> off a wind turbine, <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2024/05/23/powerful-tornado-topples-wind-turbines-in-us-experts-say-such-destruction-is-extremely-rar" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>which probably wouldn’t happen</u></a>.

(I bet Warner Bros. <em><em>loved</em></em> that one.)

## Humanity’s Most Abundant Material Is a Huge Climate Problem

date: 2024-07-24, from: Heatmap News

</p><p class="drop-caps">
	The world uses about 30 billion tons of concrete every year — more than any other material except water. It is the most ubiquitous human-made substance in the global economy. It’s also a huge climate problem. Producing cement, which is the key ingredient in concrete, generates roughly 8% of global annual greenhouse gas emissions.
</p><p>
<a href="https://x.com/cody_finke" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Cody Finke</u></a> has a plan to change that. He is the chief executive officer and cofounder of Brimstone, a startup that says it can cheaply produce ordinary Portland cement — the kind used in construction worldwide — without carbon emissions. This week, Rob chats with Finke about why cement’s carbon emissions aren’t from fossil fuels, why there are fewer cement plants than you might think, and the all-important difference between cement and concrete.

	Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p><blockquote>
<strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>Concrete is such an archetypal big machine problem in decarbonization. Because not only is it carbon intensive, but also — like car engines or like plane engines but, notably, unlike power plants — maybe like power plants — the technology to do it is extremely dispersed. There are hundreds of thousands of concrete plants around the world, and they all have to be replaced to decarbonize this process. It’s just a huge, huge scaling endeavor, and one that, forces you to reckon with the material implications of decarbonization in a way that, I think, it can often be easier to skip over or, just think, in the form of electricity: <em><em>Oh, we can just drop new power plants in, we can build renewables</em></em>. But that’s not how decarbonizing concrete will work.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Cody Finke:</strong> I would actually want to challenge that slightly.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>Perfect.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Finke: </strong>So, for many solutions, that’s the case because you’re absolutely right, there are hundreds of thousands of concrete plants. But there are not hundreds of thousands of cement plants. Cement is the binder in concrete, and for the listeners —<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>Yeah, let’s actually do this because clearly I also don’t fully understand.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Finke: </strong>Concrete’s the building material. It is the most consumed material on the planet. We make 40 to 50 billion tons of it every year as humans. Concrete is sand, gravel, water, and cement — cement is the glue. Without cement, concrete would just be a pile of sand and gravel — a wet pile of sand and gravel. Cement is essential for turning that pile of sand and gravel into a pourable rock.<br/>
<br/>
But cement is only about 10% of concrete — 10% to 20% — and it's made in large, centralized facilities that are located basically around big population centers. There are only 2,000 or 3,000 cement plants in the world. So it depends on your solution, right? If your solution is making a novel material, then it may require working at the concrete level, which can be good and bad. There’s a lot of those facilities, but they’re also a bit cheaper. There’s good and bad attributes of that.<br/>
<br/>
But if you were to do something like what Brimstone is doing, which is making ordinary Portland cement, then what you have to do is replace those 2,000 or 3,000 cement plants, which is still a big number —<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> It is still a big number, but actually not a very big number.

## In Indianapolis, Harris addresses Black sorority, a key campaign mobilizer

date: 2024-07-24, from: VOA News USA

Indianapolis — U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a speech to a historically Black sorority in Indianapolis on Wednesday, marking one of her first public appearances since President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and endorsed her for the Democratic Party nomination on Sunday.


Speaking at the biennial gathering of the Zeta Phi Beta (ZPB) sorority, Harris delivered a speech that closely echoed remarks made on the campaign trail, though the event was part of her official duties as vice president.


Founded in 1920 at Harris' alma mater, Howard University, ZPB is one of the nation's largest historically Black sororities — social organizations with female-only memberships at colleges and universities whose purpose is to foster community, academic achievement and career development, among other things.


In remarks during the visit, announced as an official White House stop before Biden dropped out, Harris lauded the president, saying that “we are deeply, deeply grateful for his service to our nation.”


“He cares about the future, he thinks about the future,” Harris said. “He has extraordinary determination and profound compassion for the people of our country.”




Earlier this month in Dallas, Texas, Harris spoke to more than 20,000 members and alumnae of her own sorority at Howard University, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc., at its national convention.


Sorority figures play key roles in the group Win With Black Women, which organized a Zoom call with 44,000 attendees just hours after Biden endorsed Harris. The group said it raised more than $1.5 million for her campaign in just a few hours.


A similar effort by Win With Black Men raised more than $1 million, adding to the $100 million raised by the Harris campaign in less than 48 hours. This is in addition to money raised by political action committees separate from the campaign. The largest one, the Future Forward PAC, reported $150 million in commitments in the first 24 hours.


Sororities and fraternities 


There are nine historically Black sororities — and fraternities, their male equivalent — known as the "Divine Nine."


Sororities and fraternities are among the most important networks in the African American community, said Steve Phillips, founder of the political media organization Democracy in Color, and author of several books on demographic shifts in the American electorate.


"Members are passionate, energetic and engaged throughout their entire lives," he told VOA, so these pre-existing and highly involved groups can swiftly emerge as formidable campaign resources.


"We saw some of this with [Barack] Obama in 2007 and 2008, and I expect it to be another order of magnitude fundraising and volunteering with Harris," he said.


Sororities are pathways to another key resource — Black female celebrities.


These groups are actively recruiting notable figures and celebrities as honorary members, said Samantha N. Sheppard, Associate Professor and Chair of the Department of Performing and Media Arts at Cornell University.


With Hollywood big names including Kerry Washington, Viola Davis, Jenifer Lewis and others pledging support for Harris, the "groundswell of Black women celebrity activism" has already begun, she told VOA.


Harris' run for the nation's top job has energized African American voters, a key Democratic constituency whose enthusiasm waned when Biden was on top of the ticket. However, amid the rampant racist and sexist attacks on Harris online, they are also bracing themselves.


"It's critical for Black women with platforms to work together to rise above the misogynoir that Harris will face," Sheppard said, using a term that combines racism and sexism to describe the oppression of Black women.


Attacks are already being launched at Harris for traveling to Indianapolis and declining to preside over Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to Congress, also happening Wednesday.


From Indianapolis, Harris heads to Houston, Texas, to speak in front of the American Federation of Teachers on Friday. After landing in Houston, Harris is scheduled to meet with local emergency response officials for a briefing on the Hurricane Beryl recovery efforts, where she will reiterate the administration’s commitment to delivering resources to affected communities.

## Harris promises compassion over 'fear and hate' in debut campaign rally

date: 2024-07-24, from: VOA News USA

MILWAUKEE — U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris assailed Donald Trump on Tuesday at her first campaign rally since replacing President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate.


In a 17-minute speech, Harris went after Trump's vulnerabilities, comparing her background as a former prosecutor to his record as a convicted felon.


Harris ticked through a list of liberal priorities, saying that if elected she would act to expand abortion access, make it easier for workers to join unions, and address gun violence, drawing a sharp contrast with Trump, the Republican nominee for president in the November 5 election.


"Donald Trump wants to take our country backward," she told a cheering crowd of several thousand at West Allis Central High School in a Milwaukee suburb in Wisconsin, a battleground state with a pivotal role in deciding the election outcome.


"Do we want to live in a country of freedom, compassion and rule of law, or a country of chaos, fear and hate?"




The raucous rally was a notable contrast to the smaller, more subdued events Biden held, underscoring Democrats' hope that Harris, 59, can revive what had been a flagging campaign under Biden, 81. The audience danced and waved Harris signs, while chants of "Ka-ma-la!" broke out when she took the stage.


She emphasized her commitment to reproductive rights, an issue that has plagued Republicans since the U.S. Supreme Court — powered by three Trump-appointed justices — eliminated a nationwide right to abortion in 2022.


Trump and his allies have tried to tether Harris to some of Biden's more unpopular policies, including his administration's handling of the surge of migrants at the southern border with Mexico.


In a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, Trump expressed confidence in his ability to defeat Harris, noting that her previous presidential run in 2020 did not even survive until the first statewide nominating contest.


Trump offered to debate Harris multiple times. Trump and Biden had one more debate scheduled on September 10 after their encounter on June 27. Biden's poor performance that night led to Democratic calls for him to step aside.


"I want to debate her, and she'll be no different because they have the same policies," Trump said.


Harris swiftly consolidated her party's support after Biden abandoned his reelection campaign under pressure from members of his party who worried about his ability to beat 78-year-old Trump, or to serve another four-year term.


Harris has received pledges from enough delegates to win the nominations, the campaign said. But nothing is certain until next month's Democratic National Convention, when the delegates will vote to determine the nominee.


Her campaign said it had raised $100 million since Sunday.


Most Democratic lawmakers have lined up behind her candidacy, including the party's leaders in the Senate and House, Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, who endorsed Harris on Tuesday at a joint press conference.


Harris' rise dramatically reshapes an election in which many voters were unhappy with their options. As the first Black woman and Asian American to serve as vice president, she would make further history as the first woman elected U.S. president.


Wisconsin is among a trio of Rust Belt states, along with Michigan and Pennsylvania, that are critical to Democrats' chances of defeating Trump.


Alyssa Wahlborg, 19, vice chair of the Whitewater College Democrats, said Harris had reenergized young voters, particularly women who want Harris to break the ultimate U.S. glass ceiling.


"I talked to my grandmom. We are both excited that she may live to see the first woman president," said Wahlborg while attending Tuesday's rally. "It's taken too long."

## Demonstrators protest Netanyahu's US visit, military aid to Israel

date: 2024-07-24, from: VOA News USA

washington — Protesters against the Gaza war staged a sit-in at a U.S. congressional office building on Tuesday, ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to Congress. Capitol Police made multiple arrests.


Netanyahu arrived in Washington on Monday for a visit that includes meetings with President Joe Biden and a Wednesday speech before a joint session of Congress. Dozens of protesters rallied outside his hotel Monday evening, and on Tuesday afternoon, hundreds staged a flashmob-style protest in the Cannon Building, which houses offices of members of the U.Sl House of Representatives.


Organized by Jewish Voice for Peace, protesters — wearing red T-shirts that read "Not In Our Name" — took over the building's rotunda by sitting on the floor, unfurling signs and chanting "Let Gaza Live!"


After about a half-hour of clapping and chanting, officers from the U.S. Capitol Police issued several warnings, then began arresting protesters — binding their hands with zip ties and leading them away one-by-one.


"I am the daughter of Holocaust survivors and I know what a Holocaust looks like," said Jane Hirschmann, a native of Saugerties, New York, who drove down for the protest along with her two daughters — both of whom were arrested. "When we say 'Never again,' we mean never for anybody."


Anger aimed at US president


The demonstrators focused much of their ire on the Biden administration, demanding the president immediately cease all arms shipments to Israel.


"We're not focusing on Netanyahu. He's just a symptom," Hirschmann said. "But how can (Biden) be calling for a cease-fire when he's sending them bombs and planes?"


As of 8 p.m. Tuesday, the Capitol Police said they did not have a final tally of the number of people arrested. But JVP said in a statement that 400 people, "including over a dozen rabbis," had been arrested.


Mitchell Rivard, chief of staff for Representative Dan Kildee of Michigan, said in a statement that his office called for Capitol Police intervention after the demonstrators "became disruptive, violently beating on the office doors, shouting loudly, and attempting to force entry into the office."


Kildee later told The Associated Press that he was confused why his office was targeted, saying he had voted against a massive supplemental military aid package to Israel earlier this year.


Netanyahu's U.S. visit has touched off a wave of protest activity, with some demonstrations condemning Israel and others expressing support but pressuring Netanyahu to strike a cease-fire deal and bring home the hostages still being held by Hamas.


Families of some of the remaining hostages held a protest vigil Tuesday evening on the National Mall, demanding that Netanyahu come to terms with Hamas and bring home the approximately 120 Israeli hostages remaining in Gaza.


About 150 people wearing yellow shirts that read "Seal the Deal NOW!" chanted "Bring Them Home" and listened to testimonials from relatives and former hostages. The demonstrators applauded when Biden's name was mentioned, but several criticized Netanyahu — known by his nickname "Bibi" — on the belief that he was dragging his feet or playing hardball on a proposed cease-fire deal that would return all of the hostages.


"I'm begging Bibi. There's a deal on the table and you have to take it," said Aviva Siegel, 63, who spent 51 days in captivity and whose husband, Keith, remains a hostage. "I want Bibi to look in my eyes and tell me one thing: that Keith is coming home."


Anticipating protests, security boosted


Multiple protests are planned for Wednesday, when Netanyahu is slated to address Congress. In anticipation, police have boosted security around the Capitol building and closed multiple roads for most of the week.


Biden and Netanyahu are expected to meet Thursday, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of the White House announcement. Vice President Kamala Harris also will meet with Netanyahu separately that day.


Harris, as Senate president, would normally sit behind foreign leaders addressing Congress, but she'll be away Wednesday on an Indianapolis trip scheduled before Biden withdrew his reelection bid and she became the likely Democratic presidential candidate over the weekend.


Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that he would meet with Netanyahu on Friday.

## Biden returns to White House as Harris soars on campaign

President Joe Biden returned to the White House Tuesday after an eventful news week that he spent entirely out of the spotlight – yet still managed to dominate with news of his exit from the presidential race. Meanwhile, his vice president hit the road launching her presidential campaign. VOA’s Anita Powell reports from the White House.

## Harris' campaign starts search for running mate

date: 2024-07-24, from: VOA News USA

washington — Who will she pick? That's the big political question in America after U.S. President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, who has quickly collected a critical mass of Democratic Party support and funding.


The selection in question is Harris' running mate, the person who would step into the role she will shed if the Democrats are victorious in November's presidential election against Republicans Donald Trump and J.D. Vance.


Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and his law firm are vetting Harris' potential vice presidential candidates, according to media reports.


The campaign has requested vetting materials from five Democratic governors — Roy Cooper of North Carolina, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Tim Walz of Minnesota and J.B. Pritzker of Illinois — and one U.S. senator, Democrat Mark Kelly of Arizona, reports The Wall Street Journal.


Those who pass the vetting "will probably have a one-on-one conversation with Harris and then she'll make a choice, probably in the week or so before the convention," William Galston, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told VOA. "The danger of an accelerated process is that you know things will be overlooked. Mistakes will be made that a more leisurely process would have prevented. But she has no choice. She has to do it fast and get it right."


Quest to balance ticket 


It "is most likely" that Harris, as the daughter of a Black father and a mother who emigrated from India, will choose a white man to be her number two, according to Joel K. Goldstein, a scholar of U.S. vice presidents and the Vincent C. Immel professor of law emeritus at the St. Louis University School of Law.


Geographical balance is another factor. Harris, who is from California, a solidly Democratic state, likely desires someone who can boost the party's chance in one of the critical swing states — territory that spans westward from Pennsylvania to Michigan, as well as the southern state of Georgia.


"Someone from the Midwest or even from the South would be a good choice," said Jay Chen, Democratic National Committee delegate from California and co-chair of Taiwanese Americans for Progress.


"Andy Beshear, he's a governor from Kentucky. I think he would make a good choice. We want to make sure that we're balancing out the ticket, because we have someone [Harris] from California," said Chen. "I think we do have to make sure that folks in the Midwest on the East Coast from the South, that they don't feel like they're going to be ignored by this administration and this is an excellent opportunity to try to try to balance out the ticket."


Historically, geographic balance "was perhaps the most common type of balance that you would see on tickets," according to Goldstein. Nowadays, "the idea of geographic balance is not really as important a calculation as some other things."


The governors of both Pennsylvania and Michigan, who are Democrats, endorsed Harris on Monday. That quashed any speculation that Shapiro or Whitmer might challenge Harris for delegates ahead of the party's national nominating convention next month. It also appeared to automatically place them into consideration to be the vice presidential nominee.


Pennsylvania in play


Pennsylvania is practically a must-win for either party. The Keystone State offers 19 electoral votes — the most of any 2024 battleground state — of the 270 required to reach the threshold for victory in a U.S. presidential election.


In an on-air conversation about Shapiro, CNN chief national correspondent John King said the governor is a contender, but "he's Jewish. There could be some risks with putting him on the ticket."


Commentators on social media quickly responded that Harris may be hesitant to select Shapiro, who is a strong supporter of Israel, as he could jeopardize her chances in Michigan, where there has been a primary election backlash against the Biden-Harris ticket from Arab American voters because of the president's support for Israel's war against Hamas.


"It says a lot about the state of American politics, and perhaps especially in progressive circles that one of the 'cons' of Kamala Harris selecting" Shapiro as her vice president, is that he is Jewish and the pushback this might receive, Arsen Ostrovsky, CEO of the International Legal Forum, a global network of lawyers supporting Israel, wrote on X on Sunday.




Harris' husband, second gentleman Douglas Emhoff, is Jewish.


There has never been a Jewish president or vice president in the United States. Democrat Al Gore in 2000 selected a Jewish U.S. senator, Joe Lieberman, as his running mate on the ticket that lost to Republicans George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.


Jews comprise less than 3% of the American population but play an outsized role in academia, business, law, the U.S. Congress, popular culture and, as has been the case with other minorities, traditionally faced institutional discrimination. Antisemitism has resurged in recent years on both the far left and far right.


The Illinois governor is also Jewish. Pritzker, a billionaire heir to the Hyatt Hotels fortune, runs a state that has a large bounty of 19 electoral votes and is considered reliably blue (Democratic).


Pritzker denied in an MSNBC interview on Tuesday that he had received a request for vetting materials from the Harris campaign. Asked if he is interested in running with her, he avoided giving a direct answer.


"I love being the governor of the state of Illinois, and I've been out on the campaign trail fighting hard for Democrats to win," he responded.


A possible first


The governor of Michigan (15 electoral votes) on the ticket with Harris would present an unprecedented combination — female candidates for both president and vice president.


Whitmer on Monday dampened such speculation.


"No, I am not planning to go anywhere," she told a reporter from WLNS TV on Monday, who asked Whitmer if she would be willing to accept an offer to join Harris on the party ticket. "I am not leaving Michigan."


No other woman is known to be under consideration by the Harris campaign.


The Republicans once nominated a woman as their vice presidential candidate. Alaska Governor Sarah Palin was selected by Senator John McCain in the 2008 election that saw Barack Obama, a Democrat, elected as the country's first African American president.


The Democrats are also the only major party to have nominated a woman for president. Hillary Clinton, who was secretary of state and the wife of former President Bill Clinton, won the popular vote in 2016, but Trump captured the most electoral votes, thus becoming president.


North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat, was elected in 2016 and again in 2020, despite Trump winning the state on the same ballot both times. Cooper is term-limited and cannot seek reelection in the Tar Hill State, which holds 16 electoral votes.


Cooper was asked repeatedly during a Monday appearance on MSNBC whether he would consider the Number 2 spot if offered by Harris.


"I appreciate people talking about me," he said, "But I think the focus right now needs to be on her this week."


Then there is Governor Andy Beshear of Kentucky (eight electoral votes), whose state some decades ago turned reliably Republican red in presidential contests. The last time a majority of Kentuckians chose a Democrat for president was in 1996, when Bill Clinton, successfully running for reelection, bested former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole in the Bluegrass State.


Some suggest a nonpolitician


Senator Mark Kelly is the sole non-governor known to be under consideration. Arizona is a Southwestern swing state with 11 electoral votes. A former Navy combat pilot and retired astronaut, Kelly is married to former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who resigned in 2012 due to severe brain injury caused by an assassination attempt.


There are suggestions Harris should think outside the box and choose a nonpolitician, such as a retired general, to bolster her chances with conservative-leaning independent voters concerned about Trump returning as commander-in-chief.


Law professor Goldstein, author of two books about the evolution of the role of the American vice presidency, does not expect that will happen.


"Every first-time vice presidential pick since 1940 has been either a current or former United States senator, governor, member of the House of Representative or a person who held high federal executive office," he said. "So, it would be surprising if the choice was somebody who came from the military."


These days, Goldstein told VOA, the primary consideration for selecting a vice presidential candidate is whether they have "the caliber that they are plausible as president, at least in the eyes of people who might support the ticket, or they have the stature and the ability [that] they can take on the sort of assignments that Vice President Harris has the last three and a half years."

## Mistral: Are LLMs Commodities Now?

date: 2024-07-24, updated: 2024-07-24, from: Tom Kellog blog

Mistral 2 Large is out, and it's right up there with GPT-4o, ...and Llama 3.1, and Claude Sonnet 3.5, and...yeah, there's a lot of them. These "Frontier Models" are starting to look more like commodities. And with that shift, we need to adjust AI strategy to match. There's strong arguments to make for using an operator that doesn't also train models. Read more!
