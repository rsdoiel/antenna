## Transit Agencies Are Climate Agencies, Too

date: 2024-01-22, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTEzMTYxNy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MTcwOTU0NH0.9scVF7NYG0LGobRnugFTGw4KT6v2l8E-upZvOf5a7Go/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Last September, Jeanie Ward-Waller, a deputy director at California’s state transportation department, was called into her supervisor’s office and told she was being removed from her role, no explanation given. But Ward-Waller <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/caltrans-freeway-project-california-18449992.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">thinks she knows what happened</a>.</p>
<p>A few weeks earlier, she’d threatened to blow the whistle on the agency for a highway repaving project that she believed was covertly — and illegally — going to widen the road. Under state law, highway expansions require environmental review and public input. It was also exactly the kind of project the agency was supposedly moving away from, according to its climate action plan, which said it would prioritize alternative forms of transit.</p>
<p>“Caltrans leaders believe they are widening highways in the public interest, despite decades of empirical research proving otherwise, and the agency’s own policies requiring solutions that reduce driving,” Ward-Waller wrote in an essay for the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> after leaving the agency.</p>
<p>Ward-Waller’s firing riled up climate advocates and sustainable transit proponents, and not just in California. (Multiple people I interviewed for this story mentioned it to me.) State transportation agencies all over the country are stuck in this kind of outdated thinking, critics say. Transportation is the biggest source of emissions in the U.S., and one of the <a href="https://rhg.com/research/us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2023/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">only sectors where emissions grew</a> last year. But most state transportation agencies are still funneling most of their budgets into road expansion projects. Few have taken on addressing climate change as part of their mission. </p>
<p>“State departments of transportation are kind of the next frontier for climate advocacy to conquer,” Justin Balik, the state program director for Evergreen Action told me. “There’s a lot of blue states where the transportation decisions are still divorced from the climate conversation.”</p>
<p>It’s a pivotal moment to change that, Balik argued. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, signed in 2021, has been <a href="https://rmi.org/states-will-determine-the-future-of-us-transportation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sending billions of dollars of flexible funding</a> into states for transportation projects. The Biden administration will also soon begin requiring these agencies to <a href="https://highways.dot.gov/newsroom/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-greenhouse-gas-emissions-reduction-tool-moves" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">set greenhouse gas reduction targets</a>. Although the targets are non-binding and states won’t be penalized for failing to achieve them, they will have to regularly report on their progress. </p>
<p>States have until February 1 to submit their initial plans to the federal Department of Transportation. So on Monday, climate and clean transportation advocates around the country <a href="https://www.evergreenaction.com/press/in-letters-to-governors-climate-and-transportation-orgs-call-for-strong-greenhouse-gas-emissions-reduction-targets?utm_source=press&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=states" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sent letters</a> to the governors of 22 states urging them to set targets consistent with reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. The letters ask officials to consider what’s achievable both through vehicle electrification and by reducing highway expansion.</p>
<p>“Electrification is critical and essential, but it’s not enough, just looking at the math, in terms of how long it's going to take for the vehicle fleet to turn over,” said Balik. “We need to think about the transportation system holistically and stop digging the hole deeper when we’re making transportation investment decisions.”</p>
<p>He directed me to a <a href="https://www.georgetownclimate.org/articles/federal-infrastructure-investment-analysis.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> published by the Georgetown Climate Center after the infrastructure law passed. The policy think tank modeled two scenarios, one where about a third of the $600 billion of flexible funding went to highway expansion, and one where states put more toward public transit and road maintenance. It found that the first scenario would increase emissions 1.6% by 2032, compared to business-as-usual, whereas the second would enable deeper emissions cuts — 1.3% more — than would otherwise have been expected with market forces and existing policies.</p>
<p>The reason is an effect called “induced demand,” and it’s at the center of this whole story. When state departments of transportation evaluate projects, they use models that assume building new roads or adding lanes increases the flow of traffic — thereby reducing congestion and reducing emissions. But real-world evidence has shown that expanding highways, especially in dense areas, actually encourages more people to drive — and within a few years, the traffic is just as bad as before.</p>
<p>“They're vastly overestimating the benefits of expansion projects,” Miguel Moravec, a senior associate at RMI told me. “If the models are not capturing the reality that expanded lanes lead to more traffic, then you can't really seriously engage with the pollution problem.”</p>
<p>The modeling is a symptom of a more entrenched issue. State Departments of Transportation are big agencies that can have thousands of staff, many of whom have been in their roles for decades. (Caltrans, for example, has <a href="https://dot.ca.gov/about-caltrans/executive-biographies/director" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than 22,000 people</a>.) The culture of these offices is built around an old paradigm where the primary metric of performance is to relieve traffic congestion — to help people drive places more quickly and easily. </p>
<p>“There's a new movement to say, maybe it’s about helping people get to where they need to go efficiently, affordably, and safely,” Matt Frommer, the senior transportation advocate at the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, told me. “But that is a really hard shift to make in a giant institution like a state DOT. Because all of the models and all of the policies and funding decision processes have been set up around the old paradigm.”</p>
<p>Even in places where that’s beginning to shift, there are still long-term challenges. California, for example, has had <a href="https://www.sb743.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a law on the books for a decade</a> that says the state must assess the impacts of transportation projects by measuring the amount of driving they induce or reduce — not by their effect on congestion. But local advocates like Jamie Pew, a climate advisor at NextGen Policy, say this has failed to move the state meaningfully away from highway expansion. </p>
<p>Ward-Waller’s firing brought long-simmering criticisms of the state’s climate strategy to a boil, he said. “For all of the money that we're investing in new transit infrastructure, electrification, and green mobility options, as long as we continue to invest in freeway expansion, we're not going to see the progress in emissions that we need to see.”</p>
<p>There are a few states that are starting to do things differently. Colorado, for example, has seen a significant shift in the way the state approaches transportation projects. In 2021, the state legislature passed a law directing its transportation agency to set regional greenhouse gas reduction targets and incorporate them into project planning. Frommer said the new approach has already resulted in real changes. In 2022, the state scrapped a long-planned highway expansion through downtown Denver after it was found that it would undermine the agency’s targets.</p>
<p>“That freed up hundreds of millions, if not over a billion dollars for other multimodal projects to help enable transit, biking and walking,” said Frommer. </p>
<p>The state that is leading the nation in innovative transportation policy, however, is Minnesota. Like Colorado, it has transportation-specific greenhouse gas targets. But it also has a specific goal to reduce “vehicle miles traveled” — a measure of how much people drive. Last year, lawmakers passed a big transportation package that gave more teeth to these goals, requiring the state’s DOT take them into account in decision making. It also went a step further and said that if the agency moves forward with any projects that induce demand, it has to offset them with additional projects that get people out of their cars.</p>
<p>The new federal rule requiring state transportation departments to report on their progress achieving declining greenhouse gas targets could help nudge more states in this direction. As climate advocates tell me on a weekly basis, “you can’t manage what you don’t measure.” </p>

Exxon hits climate activist-investors with lawsuit</h3><p><strong></strong>ExxonMobil <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=ed32aade0f&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">filed a lawsuit</a> against environmental activists who are using a shareholder resolution to push the oil giant to more aggressively cut its planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. The company accused the shareholders from activist-investor groups Follow This and Arjuna Capital of having an “extreme agenda” and wants their proposal removed from the ballot so it cannot be voted on at the annual investor meeting. The lawsuit is “highly unusual,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=f48aeb3f84&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a> Kevin Crowley at <em>Bloomberg Green</em>, because large companies typically have to appeal to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) if they want to block individual shareholder motions. A legal judgment in Exxon’s favor “could have a chilling effect on shareholder petitions,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=02ac1cd9d9&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> the <em>Financial Times.</em><br/><br/>Until recently, companies were allowed to exclude shareholder proposals that demanded climate timelines and targets. The SEC nixed this rule in 2021 and since then the number of environmental social shareholder proposals voted on has <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=75bac6fdc7&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">increased</a> by 125%.</p><h3>3. Ford to cut F-150 Lightning production</h3><p><strong></strong>In case you missed it: Ford is cutting production of its electric pickup truck, the F-150 Lightning, to 1,600 models per week, down from 3,200. The company announced the news late last week, saying it wanted its output to better match market demand. <em>Quartz</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=726812bb5c&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suggested</a> this was code for<em> “people don’t like electric trucks as much as we thought they did.”</em> And indeed, Ford is ramping up production of its gas-powered Bronco and Raptor vehicles. Kelley Blue Book analysts <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=8367564b7a&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> the <em>FT</em> that the EV slowdown is real, but followed that up by saying that “the EV market in the U.S. is still growing.” Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares urged automakers to avoid triggering a “race to the bottom” by reducing prices to boost sales, and singled out Tesla.<br/><br/>All this push-pull is happening at the same time that the Environmental Protection Agency is trying to firm up <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=627534d15a&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stringent new emissions rules</a> that would result in nearly 70% of all new vehicles in 2032 being electric. Major automakers say the rules are unreasonable, <em>Reuters</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=5ea1402d4f&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>, while environmentalists, Democratic lawmakers, and – naturally – Tesla want to see them go ahead.</p><h3>4. H2 Green Steel raises $5.17 billion </h3><p><strong></strong>The company promising to build the world’s first large-scale green steel manufacturing plant has <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=3798dbbccc&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raised</a> $5.17 billion in new funding, bringing its total to about $7 billion. <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=aac6901e64&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">H2 Green Steel</a> is building a plant in Sweden that can make steel using hydrogen produced from renewable electricity, eliminating the need for coal and reducing manufacturing emissions by 95%. The company hopes to have the plant up and running by 2025 and produce 5 million metric tons of green steel by 2030. As <em>Canary Media</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=7e4f0935c3&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a>, “that’s just a fraction of the nearly 2 billion metric tons of steel produced globally each year,” but still, the factory “would be a milestone for the push to decarbonize steel.” H2 says it has already sold half the initial yearly volumes of steel it will make. The steelmaking industry produces somewhere between 7% and 9% of global human-caused carbon emissions.</p><h3>5. AI could help grocery stores reduce food waste</h3><p><strong></strong>Grocery stores are <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=c6d59ab7f8&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reportedly</a> starting to use artificial intelligence to help reduce food waste. The inefficent chore of finding, pricing, and positioning older products takes up a lot of workers’ time, costs supermarkets revenue, and results in wasted food. And since food waste accounts for between 8% and 10% of greenhouse gas emissions, selling more food before it goes bad is an admirable quest. A Danish company called Too Good To Go has developed AI software that can help stores optimize discounts on food items that are nearing their expiration date to improve sales.

## Hubble Observes an Askew Galaxy Coaxing Star Formation from its Partner

date: 2024-01-22, from: NASA breaking news

Arp 300 consists of two interacting galaxies, UGC 05028 (the smaller face-on spiral galaxy) and UGC 05029 (the larger face-on spiral). Likely due to its gravitational dance with its larger partner, UGC 05028 has an asymmetric, irregular structure, which is not as visible from ground-based telescopes but is quite distinct in this new image from […]

## Yet another headache for Boeing

date: 2024-01-22, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Scrutiny of Boeing planes have grown beyond the 737 Max 9, the aircraft that was thrust into the spotlight following the Alaska Airlines accident earlier this month. The Federal Aviation Administration has urged airlines to inspect some older 737 model with the same door plug designs as the Max 9. We&#8217;ll explore what&#8217;s at stake. Plus, higher interest rates and the troubled commercial real estate are piling pressure onto regional banks.</p>

## Pluralistic: Boeing, Spirit and Jetblue, a monopoly horror-story (21 Jan 2024)

date: 2024-01-22, from: Cory Doctorow's blog

Today's links Boeing, Spirit and Jetblue, a monopoly horror-story: 43 years later, Reagan's other shoe drops. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading Boeing, Spirit and Jetblue, a monopoly horror-story (permalink) Last week, William Young, an 82 year old federal judge appointed by Ronald Reagan, blocked the merger of Spirit Airlines and Jetblue. It was a seismic event: https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.254267/gov.uscourts.mad.254267.461.0_6.pdf Seismic because the judge's opinion is full of rhetoric associated with the surging antitrust revival, sneeringly dismissed by corporate apologists as "hipster antitrust." Young called America's airlines and "oligopoly," a situation he blamed on out-of-control mergers. As Matt Stoller writes, this is the first airline merger to be blocked by the DOJ and DOT since deregulation in 1978: https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/antitrust-enforcers-block-the-jetblue The judge wasn't shy about why he was reviving a pre-Jimmy Carter theory of antitrust: "[the merger] does violence to the core principle of antitrust law, 'to protect] markets –- and its market participants &#8212; from anticompetitive harm." The legal arguments the judge advances are fascinating and worthy of study: https://twitter.com/johnmarknewman/status/1747343447227519122 But what really caught my eye was David Dayen's American Prospect article about the judge's commentary on the state of the aviation industry: https://prospect.org/infrastructure/transportation/01-19-2024-how-boeing-ruined-the-jetblue-spirit-merger/ Why, after all, have Spirit and Jetblue been so ardent in pursuing mergers? Jetblue has had two failed merger attempts with Virgin, and this is the third time they've failed in an attempt to merge with Spirit. Spirit, meanwhile, just lost a bid to merge with Frontier. Why are these two airlines so obsessed with combining with each other or any other airline that will have them? As Dayen explains, it's because US aviation has been consumed by monopoly, hollowed out to the point of near collapse, thanks to neoliberal policies at every part of the aviation supply-chain. For one thing, there's just not enough pilots, nor enough air-traffic controllers (recall that Reagan's first major act in office was to destroy the air traffic controller's union). But even more importantly, there are no more planes. Boeing's waitlist for airplane delivery stretches to 2029. And Boeing is about to deliver a lot fewer planes, thanks to its disastrous corner-cutting, which grounded a vast global fleet of 737 Max aircraft (again): https://prospect.org/infrastructure/transportation/2024-01-09-boeing-737-max-financial-mindset/ The 737 disaster(s) epitomize the problems of inbred, merger-obsessed capitalism. As Luke Goldstein wrote, the rampant defects in Boeing's products can be traced to the decision to approve Boeing's 1997 merger with McDonnell-Douglas, a company helmed by Jack Welch proteges, notorious for cost-cutting at the expense of reliability: https://prospect.org/infrastructure/transportation/2024-01-09-boeing-737-max-financial-mindset/ Boeing veterans describe the merger as the victory of the bean-counters, which led to a company that chases short-term profits over safety and even the viability of its business: https://www.airliners.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=213075 After all, the merger turned Boeing into the single largest exporter in America, a company far too big to fail, teeing up tens of billions from Uncle Sucker, who also account for 40% of Boeing's income: https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/its-time-to-nationalize-and-then The US government is full of ex-Boeing execs, just as Boeing's executive row is full of ex-US federal aviation regulators. Bill Clinton's administration oversaw the creation of Boeing's monopoly in the 1990s, but it was the GOP that rescued Boeing the first time the 737 Maxes started dropping out of the sky. Boeing's biggest competitor is the state-owned Airbus, a joint venture whose major partners are the governments of France, Spain and Germany &#8211; governments that are at least theoretically capable of thinking about the public good, not short-term profits. Boeing's largest equity stakes are held by the Vanguard Group, Vanguard Group subfiler, Newport Trust Company, and State Street Corporation: https://prospect.org/blogs-and-newsletters/tap/2024-01-18-airbus-advantage/ As Matt Stoller says, America has an airline that the public bails out, protects, and subsidizes but has no say over. Boeing has all the costs of public ownership and none of the advantages. It's the epitome of privatized gains and socialized losses. This is Reagan's other legacy, besides the disastrous shortage of air-traffic controllers. The religious belief in deregulation &#8211; especially deregulation of antitrust enforcement &#8211; leads to a deregulated market. It leads to a market that is regulated by monopolists who secretly deliberate, behind closed board-room doors, and are accountable only to their shareholders. These private regulators are unlike government regulators, who are at least nominally bound by obligations to transparency and public accountability. But they share on thing in common with those public regulators: when they fuck up, the public has to pay for their mistakes. It's a good thing Boeing's executives are too big to fail, because they fail constantly. Boeing execs who are warned by subcontractors of dangerous defects in their planes order those subcontractors to lie, or lose their contracts: https://www.levernews.com/boeing-supplier-ignored-warnings-of-excessive-amount-of-defects-former-employees-allege/ As a result of Boeing's mismanagement, America's only aircraft supplier steadily has lost ground to Airbus, which today enjoys a 2:1 advantage over Boeing. But it's not just Boeing that's the weak link aviation. US aviation is a chain entirely composed of weak links. Take jet engines: Pratt &#38; Whitney are Spirit's major engine supplier, but these engines suck as much as Boeing's fuselages. Much of Spirit's fleet is chronically grounded because the engines don't run. The reason Spirit buys its engines from those loveable goofballs at Pratt &#38; Whitney? The Big Four airlines have bought all the engines for sale from other suppliers, leaving smaller airlines to buy their engines from fat-fingered incompetents. This is why &#8211; as Dayen notes &#8211; smaller US airlines are so horny for intermarriage. They can't grow by adding routes, because there are no pilots. Even if they could get pilots, there'd be no slots because there are no air traffic controllers. But even if they could get pilots and slots, there are no planes, because Boeing sucks and Airbus can't make planes fast enough to supply the airlines that don't trust Boeing. And even if they could get aircraft, there are no engines because the Big Four aviation cartel cornered the market on working jet engines. Part of Jetblue and Spirit's pitch was that they hand off the routes that they'd cut after their merger to other small airlines, like Frontier and Allegiant. But Frontier and Allegiant can't service those routes: they don't have pilots, slots, planes or engines. Spirit hasn't been profitable since 2019 and is sitting on $4b in debt. Jetblue was proposing to finance its acquisition with another $3.5b in debt. The resulting airline could only be profitable by sharply cutting routes and massively raising prices, cutting 6.1m seats/year. With a debt:capital ratio of 111%, the company would have no slack and would need a bailout any time anything went wrong. Not coincidentally, the Big Four airlines also have debt:capital ratios of about 100-120%, and they do get bailouts ever time anything goes wrong. As William McGee reminds us, it's been 14 years since anyone's started a new US airline: https://twitter.com/WilliamJMcGee/status/1747363491445375072 US aviation is deeply cursed. But Boeing's self-disassembling aircraft show us why we can't fix it by allowing mergers: private monopolies, shorn of the discipline of competition and regulation, are extraction machines that turn viable businesses into debt-wracked zombies. This is a subject that's beautifully illustrated in Dayen's 2020 book Monopolized, in the chapter on health care: https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/29/fractal-bullshit/#dayenu The US health care system has been in trouble for a long time, but the current nightmare starts with the deregulation of pharma. Pharma companies interbred with one another in a string of incestuous marriages that produced these dysfunctional behemoths that were far better at shifting research costs to governments and squeezing customers than they were at making drugs. The pharma giants gouged hospitals for their products, and in response, hospitals underwent their own cousin-fucking merger orgy, producing regional monopolies that were powerful enough to resist pharma's price-hikes. But in growing large enough to resist pharma profiteering, the hospitals also became powerful enough to screw over insurers. Insurers then drained their own gene pool by combining with one another until most of us have three or fewer insurers we can sign up with &#8211; companies that are both big enough to refuse hospital price-hikes, and to hike premiums on us. Thus monopoly begets monopoly: with health sewn up by monopolies in medical tech, drugs, pharmacy benefit managers, insurance, and hospitals, the only easy targets for goosing profits are people: https://pluralistic.net/2022/01/05/hillrom/#baxter-international This is how you get a US medical system that costs more than any other rich nation's system to operate, delivers worse outcomes than those other systems, and treats medical workers worse than any other wealthy country. Now, rich people can still buy their way out of this mess, but you have to be very rich indeed to buy your way out of the commercial aviation system. There's a lot of 1%ers who fly commercial, and they're feeling the squeeze &#8211; and there's no way they're leasing their own jets. Stein's Law holds that "anything that can't go on forever will eventually stop." America's aviation mergers &#8211; in airlines, aircraft and engines &#8211; have hollowed out the system. The powerful, brittle companies that control aviation have so much power over their workforce that they've turned air traffic controller and pilot into jobs that no one wants &#8211; and they used their bailout money to buy out the most senior staff's contracts, sending them to early retirement. Now, I'm with the people who say that most of US aviation should be replaced with high-speed rail, but that's not why our technocrats and finance barons have gutted aviation. They did it to make a quick buck. A lot of quick bucks. Now the system is literally falling to pieces in midair. Now the system is literally on fire: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/19/us/miami-boeing-plane-engine-fire.html Which is how you get a Reagan appointed federal judge issuing an opinion that has me punching the air and shouting, "Yes, comrade! To the barricades!" Anything that can't go on forever will eventually stop. When the system is falling to pieces around you, ideology disintegrates like a 737 Max.

## Australia axes its “golden visa” scheme for wealthy investors

date: 2024-01-22, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Designed to attract foreign business, Australia&#8217;s visa scheme was cut in an immigration overhaul after the government found it was &#8220;delivering poor economic outcomes.&#8221; Also on the program: A month-long fishing ban comes into force off the French Atlantic coast today. Then we&#8217;ll head to Bolivia, the world&#8217;s biggest exporter of Brazil nuts. But nut producers there are grappling with volatile prices.</p>

## Private conversations in public

date: 2024-01-22, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>I’m currently <a href="https://json.blog/letters/">taking part</a> in Jason’s <a href="https://json.blog/2022/11/28/a-new-project.html">Letters</a> experiment and I have to say that it’s a lot of fun. As I said to him, writing something that is usually meant to be private knowing that will be published somewhere is a weird feeling.</p>
<p>I like that it offers readers a glimpse into what corresponding with people online looks like. As I wrote many times before, if you want to engage with me, please do write me an email. I read every single one of them and I also try my best to reply to everyone. Sometimes life takes over and I forget but I really do try my best to reply because I believe it’s important to connect with others.</p>
<p>I also believe in kindness, in curiosity, in being open to learn about others and their lives. I love to know what you do, and what you’re passionate about so, again, if you want to make a new connection, please do get in touch.</p>

On January 22, 1973, the Supreme Court handed down the Roe v. Wade decision. By a 7&#8211;2 vote, the Supreme Court found that the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution guaranteed the right of privacy under its &#8220;concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action.&#8221; This right to privacy, the court said, guarantees a pregnant woman the right to obtain an abortion without restriction in the first trimester of a pregnancy. After that point, the state can regulate abortion, it said, &#8220;except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.&#8221;

## Stanford's Tara Vanderveer Now Winningest Coach in Major College Basketball

date: 2024-01-22, from: VOA News USA

STANFORD, Calif.  — Tara VanDerveer's face shined in every corner of Maples Pavilion with that very message. Yes, the Stanford Hall of Famer now stands atop major college basketball as the winningest coach of all time.


"Today was just so wonderful," VanDerveer said. Even though she had to text her 96-year-old mother, Rita, they'd need to cancel a scheduled bridge game because of all the postgame festivities to celebrate her. "It is a big number and I'm very appreciative of the great players I've coached and the great places I've been and the attention it's brought to women's basketball."


Just as those who love her so hoped it would turn out, VanDerveer passed former Duke and Army coach Mike Krzyzewski with her 1,203rd career victory at home in Maples when No. 8 Stanford beat Oregon State, 65-56.


And it never fails that VanDerveer always takes a minute to thank everybody for coming to the game, and that includes offering her immense gratitude to the Stanford band. On Sunday, moments after her latest remarkable milestone in a career filled with them, she politely asked the band to stop playing. VanDerveer took the microphone and began with her words of appreciation once more.


"I'm overwhelmed," she told the crowd. "I'm not usually lost for words but it's pretty impressive, all these people here, all the former players coming back."


A head coach since age 24, VanDerveer celebrated with thousands of supporters and a couple dozen former players on hand to cheer her on for yet another triumph in a decorated 45-year career featuring so many memorable accomplishments.


And for a nearly full arena, this was also a chance for fans to show their love to the Hall of Fame coach who has been shining her light on women's basketball for 4 1/2 decades.


"Tara! Tara!" they yelled in the closing seconds before the celebration began.


"This is a tremendous accomplishment for Tara VanDerveer, who is already one of the most accomplished coaches in the history of basketball," Krzyzewski said in a statement. "This is yet another milestone to add to an amazing legacy. More important than all the astounding numbers and career accomplishments, she's positively impacted countless lives as a coach and a mentor. Tara remains a true guardian of our sport."


A video tribute with messages from everyone from Billie Jean King to Steve Kerr, Dawn Staley and Coach K himself showed on the big screen.


It was tense at times, with VanDerveer standing with arms crossed and pacing the sideline as Kiki Iriafen and her supporting cast made the big plays when it mattered most — including Iriafen's first 3-pointers. Stanford was missing All-American Cameron Brink because of a lower left leg injury suffered in Friday's win over Oregon.


"I want to bring attention to the beauty of women's basketball and the wonderfulness of these players that work so hard," VanDerveer said. "I'm so jealous because I never got to do what they get to do and I'm able to watch a little girl's dream play out through them."


Iriafen contributed a career-high 36 points on 16-for-26 shooting and 11 rebounds and Talana Lepolo 14 points and six assists for the Cardinal (17-2, 6-1 Pac-12). The game drew a near-capacity crowd of 7,022 at Maples Pavilion, which holds 7,233.


VanDerveer improved to 1,203-267 overall and 1,051-216 over 38 seasons at Stanford. A 17-time Pac-12 Coach of the Year with five national Coach of the Year honors, VanDerveer has captured three NCAA titles with Stanford — 1990, '92 and 2021 — and coached the 1996 U.S. Olympic team to a gold medal at the Atlanta Games during a year away from Stanford.


Stanford led 28-22 at the break having shot just 12 of 34 but was willed in the second half as former star players such as Jennifer Azzi, Chiney Ogwumike, Ros Gold-Onwude and Jayne Appel-Marinelli were among those in attendance along with former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice supporting the beloved coach.


"What does it mean to me? It means everything. It's like your family member getting married or someone had a baby, Coach is making history, we all come back and we celebrate," Ogwumike said. "It's just a part of our life now. Showing up for Tara is the same way you show up for a sister, an aunt, a brother. She's family to all of us."


VanDerveer received warm ovations at every chance, from the moment she walked out onto the court during pregame warmups and again for introductions. She credited the Beavers for their grace in offering congratulations in the hand-shake line after the final buzzer.


Oregon State coach Scott Rueck credits VanDerveer for elevating the entire conference over the decades.


"The most remarkable thing about her is she's done it for so long and she's remained at such a high level of excellence," Rueck said. "And that's her preparation, her attention to detail is the separator."


Azzi offered a sentiment that hundreds of other former VanDerveer players would certainly share: "I got to play for the greatest coach of all-time."

## EPA Assessment Shows Almost No Gains in Nitrogen Pollution

date: 2024-01-22, from: VOA News USA

St. LOUIS — The nation's rivers and streams remain stubbornly polluted with nutrients that contaminate drinking water and fuel a gigantic dead zone for aquatic life in the Gulf of Mexico, according to a recently released Environmental Protection Agency assessment.


It's a difficult problem that's concentrated in agricultural regions that drain into the Mississippi River. More than half of the basin's miles of rivers and streams were in poor condition for nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizer that drains into waterways, the agency found. For decades, federal and state officials have struggled to control farm runoff, the biggest source of nutrient pollution that is not typically federally regulated.


It's a problem only expected to get harder to control as climate change produces more intense storms that dump rain on the Midwest and South. Those heavy rains flood farm fields, pick up commercial fertilizers and carry them into nearby rivers.


"It's really worrying that we are clearly not meeting the goals that we've set for ourselves," said Olivia Dorothy, director of river restoration with the conservation group American Rivers.


The assessment is based on samples collected in 2018 and 2019 and it allows experts to compare river conditions from previous rounds of sampling, although different sampling sites were used. It takes years for the agency to compile the results and release the report, which is the most comprehensive assessment of the nation's river and stream health. Phosphorus levels dipped slightly while nitrogen levels remained almost exactly the same.


About half of all river miles were found to be in poor condition for snails, worms, beetles and other bottom-dwelling species that are an important indicator of biological health of the river. About a third were also rated as having poor conditions for fish based on species diversity.


"Controlling pollution is a big job. It is hard work," said Tom Wall, director of watershed restoration, assessment and protection division at EPA. "Things are not getting worse, despite the tremendous pressures on our waterways. And we would like to see more progress."


Water pollution from factories and industry is typically federally regulated. The Biden administration recently proposed toughening regulations on meat and poultry processing plants to reduce pollution, Wall said.


When nutrient pollution flows into the Gulf of Mexico, it spurs growth of bacteria that consume oxygen. That creates a so-called "dead zone," a vast area where it's difficult or impossible for marine animals to survive, fluctuating from about the size of Rhode Island to the size of New Jersey, according to Nancy Rabalais, professor of oceanography and wetland studies at Louisiana State University.


That affects the productivity of commercial fisheries and marine life in general, but nutrient pollution is also damaging upstream. Too much nitrate in drinking water can affect how blood carries oxygen, causing human health problems like headaches, nausea and abdominal cramps. It can especially affect infants, sometimes inducing "blue baby syndrome," which causes the skin to take on a bluish hue.


The EPA established the hypoxia task force in the late 1990s to reduce nutrient pollution and shrink the dead zone, but it relies on voluntary efforts to reduce farm runoff and hasn't significantly reduced the dead zone.


Anne Schechinger, Midwest director with the Environmental Working Group, said new regulations are needed, not voluntary efforts. She said the Biden administration has done a lot to improve drinking water, but not enough to reduce agricultural runoff.


Methods to prevent runoff include building buffers between farmland and waterways, creating new wetlands to filter pollutants and applying less fertilizer.


It's a politically fraught issue, especially in major Midwest farming states that significantly contribute to the problem. Many of those states cite their voluntary conservation programs as evidence they're taking on the problem, yet the new EPA data shows little progress.


Minnesota is one of the few states that has a so-called "buffer law" that requires vegetation to be planted along rivers, streams and public drainage ditches. But because groundwater and surface water are closely connected in much of the Upper Midwest, nutrient pollution can end up leaching underground through farm fields and eventually bypass those buffers, ending up in streams anyway, said Gregory Klinger, who works for the Olmsted County, Minnesota soil and water conservation district.


There should also be a focus on preventing over-fertilizing – about 30% of farmers are still using more than the recommended amounts of fertilizer on their fields, said Brad Carlson, an extension educator with the University of Minnesota who communicates with farmers about nutrient pollution issues.


Martin Larsen, a farmer and conservation technician in southeast Minnesota, said he and other farmers are interested in practices that reduce their nutrient pollution. He's broken up his typical corn and soybean rotation with oats and medium red clover, the latter a kind of plant that can increase nitrogen levels in the soil naturally. He's been able to get by with about half as much fertilizer for a corn crop that follows a clover planting as compared to a corn-corn rotation.


Growing oats and red clover as cover crops improves soil, too. But Larsen said it's difficult for many farmers to plant them when they often rely on an immediate payback for anything they grow. Cover crops are planted on just 5.1% of harvested farmland, according to 2017 data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.


Larsen said since regulations are so unpopular, more should be done to incentivize better practices. For example, he said that could include companies shifting the makeup of feed they use for animals, giving farmers an opening to plant some crops that use less fertilizer. Or government programs that do more to subsidize things like cover crops.


He said that many farmers in his community acknowledge the need to do things differently. "But we also feel very trapped in the system," he said.

Smartwatches at the turn of the century were a more motley assortment than today&#8217;s, with an even wilder range of functionality. If you had a few hundred dollars or so, there were some interesting options, even back then. But if all you had was $85 (in 2024 dollars about $150), you still weren&#8217;t left out, because in 2001 you could get the Web-@nywhere (the &#8220;Worldwide Web Watch&#8221;). Load up the software on your PC and slap it in its little docking station, and you could slurp down about 93K of precious Web data to scroll on the 59&#215;16 screen — 10 characters by 2 characters — to read any time you wanted! That is, of course, if the remote host the watch&#8217;s Windows 9x-based client accessed were still up, on which it depended for virtually anything to download and install.

## Platform tilt: documenting the uneven playing field for an independent browser like Firefox

date: 2024-01-22, from: OS News

This tilt manifests in a variety of ways. For example: making it harder for a user to download and use a different browser, ignoring or resetting a user’s default browser preference, restricting capabilities to the first-party browser, or requiring the use of the first-party browser engine for third-party browsers. For years, Mozilla has engaged in dialog with platform vendors in an effort to address these issues. With renewed public attention and an evolving regulatory environment, we think it’s time to publish these concerns using the same transparent process and tools we use to develop positions on emerging technical standards. So today we’re publishing a new issue tracker where we intend to document the ways in which platforms put Firefox at a disadvantage and engage with the vendors of those platforms to resolve them. ↫ The official Mozilla blog Excellent initative.

## What’s that touchscreen in my room?

date: 2024-01-22, from: OS News

Roughly a year ago I moved into my new apartment. One of the reasons I picked this apartment was age of the building. The construction was finished in 2015, which ensured pretty good thermal isolation for winters as well as small nice things like Ethernet ports in each room. However, there was one part of my apartment that was too new and too smart for me. It is obviously a touchscreen of some sort, but there was zero indication as to what it controls. The landlord had no idea what this is. There are no buttons or labels on the thing, just a tiny yellow light to let you know it has the power. ↫ Nikita Lapkov What follows is an investigation into what it is, how to get it working, and, of course, how to hack it and make it more useful.

## The case for Rust (in the FreeBSD base system)

date: 2024-01-21, from: OS News

FreeBSD is discussing adding Rust to the FreeBSD base system. In a recent thread on src-committers, we discussed the costs and benefits of including Rust code in the FreeBSD base system. To summarize, the cost is that it would double our build times. imp suggested adding an additional step after buildworld for stuff that requires an external toolchain. That would ease the build time pain. The benefit is that some tools would become easier to write, or even become possible. ↫ Warner Losh on the freebsd-hackers mailing list From everything I&#8217;ve read and what you, the readers, have told me, someone who isn&#8217;t a programmer, languages like Rust really are a big improvement over older languages, and it&#8217;s probably not a good idea for a major, important project like FreeBSD to isolate its base system from such progress. Now, I&#8217;m not at all qualified to say whether Rust, specifically, is the right choice, but a language like Rust should probably be part of the base system. A big issue is FreeBSD&#8217;s architecture support. Rust is not well-supported or even supported at all on all the various platforms FreeBSD supports, which might prove to be a road block for now. That being said, letting barely used ISAs hamper your progress too much might not be a good idea either. Rust has already become a supported language for the development of the Linux kernel.

## 'Mean Girls' Fetches $11.7M in Second Weekend to Stay No. 1 at US Box Office

date: 2024-01-21, from: VOA News USA

New York — On a quiet weekend in movie theaters, "Mean Girls" repeated atop the box office with $11.7 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday, while a handful of awards contenders sought to make an impact ahead of Oscar nominations Tuesday.


With a dearth of new releases in cinemas, Paramount Pictures' Tina Fey-scripted musical "Mean Girls" pushed its two-week total past $50 million, along with $16.2 million internationally. So far, it's outpacing the tally for the 2004 original "Mean Girls."


Only one new film debuted in wide release: "I.S.S.," a modestly budgeted sci-fi thriller starring Ariana DeBose. The film, which speculates what would happen aboard the International Space Station if war broke out between the U.S. and Russia, debuted with $3 million on 2,518 screens for Bleecker Street.


Expectations weren't high for "I.S.S.," which drew only so-so reviews and was lightly marketed. Audiences also didn't like it, giving the film a "C-" CinemaScore.


But even for January, historically a low ebb for moviegoing, it was a sparsely attended weekend, with paltry options on the big screen. The top 10 films collectively accounted for just $51.3 million in box office, according to Comscore.


With a similarly thin release schedule on deck for next weekend, it could be the start of a chastening trend for Hollywood in 2024. Due to production delays caused by last year's strikes, there are significant holes throughout this year's movie calendar.


The Jason Statham thriller "The Beekeeper," from Amazon MGM Studios, remained in second place, grossing $8.5 million in its second weekend to bring its total to $31.1 million. Warner Bros. "Wonka," six weeks into its smash run in theaters, was third, with $6.4 million in ticket sales. It's taken in $187.2 million domestically.


Also continuing to leg out was Sony Pictures' "Anyone But You." The rom-com starring Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell, crossed $100 million globally in its fifth week of release. It's the highest grossing R-rated romantic comedy — a genre that has largely migrated to streaming platforms — since 2016's "Bridget Jones's Baby." Domestically, it came in fourth with $5.4 million.


Much of the weekend's action was in expanding awards contenders.


After a qualifying release in December, Ava DuVernay's "Origin," starring Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor as the "Caste" author Isabel Wilkerson, launched in 125 theaters and pulled in $875,000 — a strong start for the acclaimed film.


Yorgos Lanthimos' dark fantasy "Poor Things," starring Emma Stone, added 820 theaters and grossed $2 million from 1,400 locations. The Searchlight Pictures release, which won the Golden Globe for best comedy-musical, has earned $33.7 million globally in seven weeks of slowly expanding release.


Cord Jefferson's "American Fiction," starring Jeffrey Wright as a frustrated novelist, expanded to 850 screens and pulled in $1.8 million. "American Fiction," up to $8 million in six weeks, will look for a boost in Tuesday's Oscar nominations.


Jonathan Glazer's Auschwitz film "The Zone of Interest" expanded to 82 screens, grossing $447,684 for A24.


But after a strong launch, another awards contender, "The Color Purple," has quickly fallen off the radar of moviegoers. Though widely acclaimed and with the backing of producers Oprah Winfrey and Steven Spielberg, the Warner Bros. musical has dropped fast in recent weeks. In its fourth week of release, the Blitz Bazawule-directed film starring Fantasia Barrino, Taraji P. Henson and Danielle Brooks, grossed just $720,000. Its domestic total is $59.3 million, below hopes for the $100-million budgeted film.


Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.


1. "Mean Girls," $11.7 million.


2. "The Beekeeper," $8.5 million.


3. "Wonka," $6.4 million.


4. "Anyone But You," $5.4 million.


5. "Migration," $5.3 million.


6. "Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom," $3.7 million.


7. "I.S.S.," $3 million.


8. "Night Swim," $2.7 million.


9. "The Boys in the Boat," $2.5 million.


10. "Poor Things," $2 million.

## In 2024, Genode to focus on multi-monitor, suspend/resume, touchpads, and much more

date: 2024-01-21, from: OS News

Without hesitation, our developer community quickly rallied behind the topic &#8220;Sculpt OS usability&#8221;, desiring to boost the user experience with respect to multi-monitor usage, convenient interactive UIs for common tasks, profound support for touchpads and touchscreens, tearing-free graphics, low-latency audio, casual on-target debugging, and suspend/resume. The focus on usability notwithstanding, we will steadily continue with the gardening of Genode&#8217;s driver landscape, fostering the consistent use of drivers ported from up-to-date Linux kernels, clear-cut ACPI support, and making drivers pluggable. In 2024, we will also promote Genode&#8217;s custom (base-hw) microkernel to become the default kernel for Sculpt OS, which is the culmination of a multi-year effort. ↫ Official Genode news post The updated roadmap for 2024 details the goals of the project for the coming current year.

## Ron Desantis, Once Trump's Biggest Threat, Ends 2024 White House Run

date: 2024-01-21, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Presidential contender Ron DeSantis, who was once viewed as Republicans' best shot at moving past Donald Trump, dropped out of the primary race on Sunday, a relatively early exit that underlines the iron grip the former president retains on the party.


DeSantis, 45, endorsed Trump in a video posted to the X social media site.  


DeSantis had been widely seen as a top contender for the 2024 Republican nomination and a natural heir to Trump due to his combative style and deeply conservative views. Early in 2023, he led several head-to-head polls against Trump.  


But the Florida governor's support has been declining for several months, due to a flawed campaign strategy, his seeming lack of ease with voters on the campaign trail and Trump's so far unshakeable hold on much of the party's base.  


The end of DeSantis' bid means that former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, is now the last Republican in the race with a shot - albeit a long one - of denying Trump the nomination. The winner of the Republican nominating contest will take on President Joe Biden, the likely Democratic nominee, in the general election in November.  


More than 70% of Republicans have a favorable opinion of Trump, according to most opinion polls. That put DeSantis in a position where he had to appeal to voters who still admired Trump, as well as those who passionately disliked him.  


DeSantis failed on both counts. He never successfully articulated to most Trump supporters why he was a better option, while Republicans looking to ditch the former president split their votes among multiple candidates. Haley, in particular, has emerged as the favorite among moderate Republicans as the field has consolidated. Where DeSantis differed from Trump on policy, it was almost always to stake out a more conservative position. He signed a six-week abortion ban in Florida in April, which he eventually embraced on the campaign trail, even as it made some donors and moderate Republicans wary.  


DeSantis opposed additional U.S. military assistance to Ukraine and took punitive actions against the Walt Disney Co. after the company spoke out against Florida legislation that limited discussion of gender and sexuality in classrooms.  


The Disney fight was one that pro-business critics within the party said DeSantis didn't need to wage.  


While many major donors threw their support behind DeSantis early on, they began to rebel as early as the summer.  


Robert Bigelow, who gave millions to the super PAC fundraising group backing DeSantis, told Reuters in August he was cutting off funding, turned off by the governor's uncompromising position on abortion.  


Campaign errors  


DeSantis' troubles began before he ever entered the race.  


In March, when Trump was indicted in New York on charges he conspired to conceal hush money payments to a porn star, the former president received a significant bump in the polls as Republicans rallied around him. Many of them believed Trump's claims that law enforcement officials were targeting him to keep him out of office.  


Several DeSantis allies say the governor waited too long to become a candidate, finally throwing his hat into the ring in May, more than six months after Trump had done so. That left DeSantis open to blistering attacks by Trump, while the governor himself did little to defend himself, insisting he was not a candidate.  


When DeSantis did formally launch his White House run in May 2023, it was a glitch-filled disaster on Twitter, now known as X, an inauspicious start for a campaign predicated on the governor's executive competence.  


The campaign then overhired, burning through cash at a rapid rate. DeSantis let go of some 38 staffers in July and ousted his campaign manager in August, sowing a narrative of internal chaos that proved hard to shake.  


He outsourced much of the traditional work of a campaign to an outside super PAC, which can accept donations of unlimited size, but cannot coordinate with the campaign itself.  


The campaign and the PAC, known as Never Back Down, came to distrust one another. A series of back-to-back departures of senior staffers from the PAC in November and December created a sense of turmoil that furthered the narrative that the governor's campaign was mortally wounded.

<p>The vision hardware looks lovely, but I am more impressed by the depth of the user experience, the guidance to developers, the design system, the operating system and the tooling to support it.</p><p>Previous headsets have been cool and exciting (I own pretty much one of each), yet none got this level of necessary scaffolding in place, so the experiences are a mish-mash of half baked ideas. </p><p>We finally go from “this is a neat idea” to a viable platform.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-01-21, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/05/30/quickley.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I realize that most of the people who read this blog aren't sports fans, something that I wish were different, because sports, like HBO series, give us a way to talk about complex human relationships in the 21st century that we don't get any other way to imho. If we all watch <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+succession">Succession</a>, for example, then we know how to talk about the relationship between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Succession_characters#Shiv_Roy">Shiv</a> and her wimpy husband whose name I now have trouble remembering (later: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Succession_characters#Tom_Wambsgans">Tom</a>). (No spoilers as to why he's significant, and won the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/75th_Primetime_Emmy_Awards">Emmy</a> for best supporting dramatic performance.) We all know the scene where they both nailed it. For anyone who has ever loved someone yet had to say goodbye anyway, it reached into your heart, and gave you a way to say to your friends -- there! -- <i>that's</i> what I was talking about. Same thing in sports, esp basketball, where you get to know a team a few players at a time, and you get to see them perform in really personal ways. Last night there was a rematch between the Knicks and the Raptors, which was one of those games you don't ever forget, because of a <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/02.html#a123238">recent trade</a> where the teams exchanged core players who formed the personality of the teams, playing each other, so we could see in a memorable and visual way what was exchanged. Understand, we loved the players who were traded away. One day they're our team, and the next day, supposedly they're the other guys. Impossible to see it that way. The love doesn't just leave, maybe it never does. But. But now you know that one of the players, a former <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10002703-rj-barrett-talks-knicks-future-i-hope-im-here-for-the-rest-of-my-career">Great Hope</a> of ours, didn't pan out, and now it's nice to see him on the court, fumbling an easy play or missing a shot you think he could've gotten, but doing it for the other team. Sadly, we think while he was the more expensive of the two stars the Knicks traded, the other one, the <a href="https://theknickswall.com/immanuel-quickley-changes-the-knicks-future/">hotshit kid</a> with an attitude is going to be the real thing, a starting point guard of a contender, an opportunity he was unlikely to get with the Knicks. Anyway thanks for listening. Last night's <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/nba/knicks-crush-raptors-as-barrett-quickley-return-to-msg-after-trade/">game</a> was something else. I understand that <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/39351490/49ers-packers-nfc-championship-game-jordan-love-brock-purdy-deebo-samuel">Niners and Packers</a> fans were emoting in other ways at the same time. I can relate.

## How to get started with Advanced Squad Leader

date: 2024-01-21, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>How to get started with Advanced Squad Leader</h1>

<p>The PDF for Advanced Squad Leader (ASL) rules has 714 pages. How do you even get started?</p>

<p>There are four <a href="https://mmpgamers.com/asl-starter-kit-c-2_8">starter kits</a> (SK):</p>

<ol>
<li>Regular infantry</li>
<li>Guns</li>
<li>Tanks</li>
<li>Pacific Theater of Operations (PTO)</li>
</ol>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to take that route and tried to dive straight in but this is not how it works. Start small.</p>

<p>You can get the <a href="https://mmpgamers.com/support/aslsk/ASLSK4_Rules_September_2021.pdf">rules for all four starter kits</a> as a PDF.</p>

<p>Buy <a href="https://www.wargamevault.com/product/344879/Electronic-Advanced-Squad-Leader-Rulebook">the complete rules</a> once you know that you like the game.</p>

<p>For online gaming, you need to download the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://vassalengine.org/">VASSAL</a>. Vassal is a game engine for building and playing online adaptations of board games and card games. Vassal is free, open-source software.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://vasl.info/">VASL</a>. VASL is the module you need to run ASL on VASSAL.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The VASL site has a section called &ldquo;Download Scenarios&rdquo; where you can download setups for many scenarios (without the mission goals). If you load those games, you&rsquo;ll see messages about all the extensions you&rsquo;re missing. Often you don&rsquo;t need them, but feel free to install them.</p>

<p>If you want a physical box of the games, with physical counters, be aware that you must buy <em>Beyond Valor</em> because it has some stuff that gets used in later boxes.</p>

<p>(Earlier: <a href="2022-11-05_Advanced_Squad_Leader">Advanced Squad Leader</a>, 2022.)</p>

## Brutally Cold Weather Reaching Deep Into Lower United States

date: 2024-01-21, from: VOA News USA

MEMPHIS, Tenn. — Arctic weather brought more misery to much of the U.S. on Saturday, especially for people unaccustomed to such bitter cold in places like Memphis, Tennessee, where residents were urged to boil water and some had no water at all after freezing temperatures broke water mains across the city. Temperatures weren't expected to rise until after the weekend.


The bracing cold followed a week of storms blamed for at least 67 deaths around the U.S., many involving hypothermia or road accidents. 


At the Four Way Grill in Memphis, owner Patrice Bates Thompson said the water problems have closed their soul food kitchen for days.


“This is our staple, and this is what basically drives the force of my family financially," Thompson told Fox-13 Memphis. "We depend on business, and we have been at home.”


So many pipes broke in Memphis that water pressure fell throughout the city. Concerned about possible contamination, Memphis Light, Gas & Water urged its more than 400,000 customers to boil water for drinking or teeth-brushing or use bottled supplies on Saturday while crews worked around the clock to make repairs.


“Our production and treatment of water is working well,” the utility said in an email. “We cannot give restoration estimates until all leaks are identified.”


The utility said more than 100 employees volunteered Saturday to identify breaks, and residents were urged to report leaks in the street, at homes and in unoccupied buildings.


Without water since Thursday morning, Pamela Wells was visited Saturday by a worker who asked whether they had a leak.


“My husband said, ‘How can we have a leak, if we don’t have any water?'” she said.


They had filled a bathtub with water to flush toilets with when they noticed the pressure dropping, Wells said. For everything else they were using a dwindling supply of bottled water until their street became passable on Saturday and friends brought in fresh supplies.


“It’s been a struggle,” she said, recalling how they lost water for a 10-day stretch in December 2022. “You don’t know how long it’ll be out.”


Meanwhile, the Memphis City Council opened seven bottled water distribution stations on Saturday, one in each council district. Two others were operating at fire stations. One had 300 cars lined up when it opened on Saturday, Shelby County Emergency Management Director Brenda Jones said in a telephone interview.




“You have people with absolutely no water, people with low water pressure, and you have the boil water advisory,” she said.


A huge swath of the U.S. was under wind chill advisories, from Montana into central Florida. It was particularly harsh in the Midwest. The wind made it feel like minus 16 degrees (minus 26 Celsius) in Iowa City on Saturday, and overnight wind chills hovered around zero in Oklahoma City, where David Overholser sought shelter at the non-profit Homeless Alliance.


“Being 63 and from Florida originally, I don’t like cold. I can’t handle it,” Overholser told The Oklahoman. “It’s been very, very rough and painful and I just, you know, try to hang on one day, one hour at a time ... it’s definitely scary.”


Wind chills dipped to minus 20 Fahrenheit (minus 28 Celsius) early Saturday in Vermont, where the Stowe Mountain Resort urged hardy skiers to "bust out all the stuff you need to hang on the mountain safely, take frequent warm up breaks inside, and keep a close eye on each other for signs of frostbite.”




Ravens fans unaccustomed to such cold in Baltimore bundled up for wind chills near zero (minus 17 Celsius) for Saturday’s playoff against the Houston Texans, but the weekend weather was business as usual in Buffalo, where the Bills called out for more shovelers to finish clearing snow from the stands before Sunday’s big game. Highmark Stadium got smothered by five feet of lake-effect snow in five days. 


Snow tapered in the Northeast after blanketing a large area including Washington and New York City. In New York, aid groups distributed food and clothes near an elementary school Saturday to migrants who bundled up in thick coats and knit caps to ward off the freezing temperatures. 




More snow was coming to West Virginia, where the weather service predicted up to 4 more inches (10 centimeters) Saturday, along with winds gusting to 40 mph (64 kph), driving wind chills down to 20 below zero (minus 29 Celsius).


More lake-effect snow pounded northwestern Indiana Friday into Saturday, creating near white-out conditions near Lake Michigan and making the busy highway corridor in and out of Chicago treacherous. 


“We’re kind of taking a chance — rolling the dice,” Frank Finney told WBBM-TV. Finney and his family were navigating Interstate 94 through Michigan City to La Porte, Indiana.


Tennessee alone recorded 26 deaths, including a 25-year-old man found dead on the floor of a mobile home in Lewisburg after a space heater overturned and turned off, said Bob Johnson, chief deputy for the Marshall County Sheriff’s Office.


“There was ice on the walls in there,” Johnson said.


On the West Coast, more freezing rain was forecast Saturday in the Columbia River Gorge and the area was expected to remain near or below freezing through at least Sunday night. Trees and power lines already coated with ice could topple if they get more, the National Weather Service warned.


“Stay safe out there over the next several days as our region tries to thaw out,” the weather service said. “Chunks of falling ice will remain a hazard as well.”


Thousands have been without power since last weekend in parts of Oregon’s Willamette Valley because of storm damage. Despite work by repair crews, about 25,000 customers were without electricity in Oregon on Saturday, according to the website poweroutage.us.


The weather service forecast above-average temperatures across most of the country next week. Meanwhile, not everyone hated the white stuff. 


“It’s fun right now,” Michigan City resident Andrew Smith told WBBM-TV. “We haven’t had this much snow in a minute, and Christmas wasn’t snowy, so it’s fun to do this. I can play with the kids, make snowballs, make a snowman.”

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump seem on track for a rematch in November’s presidential election.

## US, China Officials Conclude Meeting on Financial Issues

date: 2024-01-21, from: VOA News USA

BANGKOK — U.S. and Chinese officials have completed the third meeting of a working group established to cooperate on financial issues, in a step that continues the trend set by the two powers last November to ease tensions. 


Officials from the U.S. Treasury Department met with counterparts in the People's Bank of China to discuss issues ranging from financial stability to countering money laundering. The delegation also met with Vice Premier He Lifeng while they were in China, according to a statement Friday from the Treasury Department. 


The group also indicated that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen would return to China for a visit at some point in the future. She was previously there in July. 


In November, Yellen met with He in San Francisco. Their two-day meeting was seen as paving the way for the later meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and China's President Xi Jinping. 


The two sides had agreed to resume cooperation on issues such as curbing fentanyl's spread, as well as military-to-military communication. While the meeting kept the relationship from getting any worse, it failed to resolve any of the major differences between the two countries. 


There have been longstanding economic issues between China and the U.S. ever since former U.S. President Donald Trump launched a trade war, setting high taxes on a number of Chinese goods.

## North Korea Stresses Alignment With Russia Against US

date: 2024-01-21, from: VOA News USA

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korea said Sunday it has agreed to further strategic and tactical cooperation with Russia to establish a "new multi-polarized international order," as the two countries work to build a united front in the face of their separate, intensifying tensions with the United States.


In describing North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui's meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minster Sergey Lavrov in Moscow last week, the North's Foreign Ministry said Putin also reaffirmed his willingness to visit Pyongyang and said that could come at an "early date."


North Korea has been actively strengthening its ties with Russia, highlighted by leader Kim Jong Un's September visit to Russia for a summit with Putin. Kim is trying to break out of diplomatic isolation and strengthen his footing as he navigates a deepening nuclear standoff with Washington, Seoul and Tokyo.


In a separate statement on Sunday, the North's Foreign Ministry condemned the U.N. Security Council for calling an emergency meeting over the country's latest ballistic test, which state media described as a new intermediate-range solid-fuel missile tipped with a hypersonic warhead. The ministry said the test-firing on January 14 was among the country's regular activities to improve its defense capabilities and that it didn't pose a threat to its neighbors.


South Korea on Thursday urged the Security Council "to break the silence" over North Korea's escalating missile tests and threats. Russia and China, both permanent members of the council, have blocked U.S.-led efforts to increase sanctions on North Korea over its recent weapons tests, underscoring a divide deepened over Russia's war on Ukraine.


The alignment between Pyongyang and Moscow has raised international concerns about alleged arms cooperation, in which the North provides Russia with munitions to help prolong its fighting in Ukraine, possibly in exchange for badly needed economic aid and military assistance to help upgrade Kim's forces. Both Pyongyang and Russia have denied accusations by Washington and Seoul about North Korean arms transfers to Russia.


North Korea's Foreign Ministry, in comments published by state media, said Choe and the Russian officials in their meetings expressed a "strong will to further strengthen strategic and tactical cooperation in defending the core interests of the two countries and establishing a new multi-polarized international order."


Russia expressed "deep thanks" to North Korea for its "full support" over its war on Ukraine, the North Korean ministry said. It said Choe and the Russian officials expressed "serious concern" over the United States' expanding military cooperation with its Asian allies that they blamed for worsening tensions in the region and threatening North Korea's sovereignty and security interests.


Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are at their highest point in years, after Kim in recent months used Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to ramp up his weapons tests and military demonstrations. The United States, South Korea and Japan have responded by strengthening their combined military exercises, which Kim portrays as invasion rehearsals, and sharpening their deterrence plans built around nuclear-capable U.S. assets.


In the latest tit-for-tat, North Korea on Friday said it conducted a test of a purported nuclear-capable underwater attack drone in response to a combined naval exercise by the United States, South Korea and Japan last week, as it continued to blame its rivals for tensions in the region.


Choe's visit to Moscow came as Kim continues to use domestic political events to issue provocative threats of nuclear conflict.


At Pyongyang's rubber-stamp parliament last week, Kim declared that North Korea is abandoning its long-standing goal of a peaceful unification with war-divided rival South Korea and ordered the rewriting of the North's constitution to cement the South as its most hostile foreign adversary. He accused South Korea of acting as "top-class stooges" of the Americans and repeated a threat that he would use his nukes to annihilate the South if provoked.


Analysts say North Korea could be aiming to diminish South Korea's voice in the regional nuclear standoff and eventually force direct dealings with Washington as it looks to cement its status as a nuclear weapons state.

## Election-Year Politics Threaten Border Deal as Trump, Allies Rally Opposition

date: 2024-01-21, from: VOA News USA

washington — A politically treacherous dynamic is taking hold as negotiators in the U.S. Congress work to strike a bipartisan deal on the border and immigration with vocal opposition from the hard right and former U.S. President Donald Trump threatening to topple the carefully negotiated compromise.


Senators are closing in on the details of an agreement on border measures that could unlock Republican support for Ukraine aid. Though they hope to unveil it as soon as next week, the deal is already wobbling, as House Speaker Mike Johnson faces intense pressure from Trump and his House allies to demand more sweeping concessions from Democrats and the White House.


"I do not think we should do a Border Deal, at all, unless we get EVERYTHING needed to shut down the INVASION of Millions & Millions of people," Trump posted on social media this week.


It's a familiar political dynamic, one that has repeatedly thwarted attempts to reform U.S. immigration law, including in 2013 when House Republicans sought to pin illegal immigration on a Democratic president and in 2018 when Trump helped sink another bipartisan effort. The path for legislation this time around is further clouded by an election year in which Trump has once again made railing against illegal immigration a central focus of his campaign.


Even though the terms of the policy negotiations have shifted significantly in the Republicans' direction, skepticism is running high among conservatives, creating a precarious moment that could determine not only the contours of U.S. immigration and border law for years, but the future of Ukraine as it faces dwindling U.S. supplies in its fight against Russia.


U.S. President Joe Biden is pressing lawmakers to say "yes." During a White House meeting this week with congressional leaders that was meant to underscore how desperately Ukraine needs funding, the president said he was ready for a "big deal on the border."




The president has reason to want an agreement. The historic number of migrants who have come to the U.S. border with Mexico during Biden's term is seen as one of the largest political vulnerabilities in his re-election campaign.


During Iowa's Republican caucuses last week, which Trump won, immigration was a top issue. An AP VoteCast survey found about 9 in 10 caucus-goers backed building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, with about 7 in 10 expressing strong support for the idea.


As asylum seekers have made their way across the country, often by the busloads to Democratic-leaning cities as part of Texas Governor Greg Abbott's program, they have strained the resources and political tolerance of areas that will be vital to Biden's re-election chances.


"It's gotten to the point where, in a way, everybody's back is against the wall," said Senator Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat. "I'm not talking about politically, I mean, substantively, these are challenges that the country can't ignore."


Bennet was joined at the Capitol on Thursday by Denver Mayor Mike Johnston, a Democrat who told reporters that the recent influx of migrants has caused "a humanitarian crisis and a fiscal crisis unlike anything we've seen in the last 25 years."


Democrats in Congress are split on the merits of the Senate package. Progressive and Hispanic lawmakers decry changes that would toughen the process for claiming asylum in the United States. Still, many Democrats say that Johnson's resistance to bipartisan compromise shows that Republicans aren't serious about solving the problems at the border.


"They basically want to make sure that the situation is as chaotic as possible so that they can win elections in November," said Representative Joaquin Castro, a Democrat. "That is their strategy. It's not a sincere attempt to do something about what's going on at the border."


Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, meanwhile, has been strongly making the case for the deal. He's told fellow Republicans that the border package, which he insisted be paired with Biden's $110 billion request for war aid for Ukraine, Israel and other national security priorities, is a rare opportunity to get stronger policies through Congress.




The proposal crafted by the Senate would toughen the asylum process with a goal of cutting the number of migrants who come to the southern border to make an asylum claim.


Negotiators have worked on some policies intended to aid immigrants. The plan could include a pathway to citizenship for Afghans who came during the U.S. withdrawal from their country, along with work permits for migrants who enter the asylum system, according to two people familiar with the talks who were granted anonymity to discuss the private negotiations.


But the package will mostly leave out broad immigration changes — such as protections for immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally as children — that have been foundational in previous Senate bills.


"It will be by far the most conservative border security bill in four decades," said Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford, the lead Republican negotiator.


Lankford and other Senate Republicans have urged their House colleagues to remain open-minded. They argue that the changes would actually pave the way for Trump to implement his border agenda if he wins the election. Lankford has also said that the legislation would not dramatically reduce the number of migrants at the border for months — a tacit signal that border security could remain a top issue through the election.


Still, Johnson has argued that a hardline House bill, H.R. 2 which passed the chamber in May without a single Democratic vote, is the solution to America's border woes. It would create a sweeping system intended to bottle up illegal immigration.


Johnson also has made clear that he has been speaking regularly with Trump.


"We're not playing politics with this," Johnson said this week. "We're demanding real, transformative policy change." 


Even beyond Trump, Johnson is dealing with far-right House members who are furious over his willingness to work with Democrats to pass legislation. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a close Trump ally, has threatened to trigger a motion to oust Johnson if he brings a border bill with Ukraine aid to the House floor.


Greene this week said Trump is backing the House conservatives' plan because "it brings back all of his strong border policies." In December, she said that passing bipartisan border legislation would only give Biden an opportunity to tout the legislation on the campaign trail.


"I've been telling everyone that President Trump is the leader of the Republican Party," Greene said. "That decisive victory in Iowa should be the shot across the bow to every single Republican that's elected."


Despite the pressure, Johnson signaled some support for the legislative push after a meeting this week at the White House, calling the talks "productive." But what he does next remains to be seen.

## Trump Becomes Indignant in Deposition Video of Civil Fraud Lawsuit

date: 2024-01-21, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Months before Donald Trump’s defiant turn as a witness at his New York civil fraud trial, the former president came face-to-face with the state attorney general who is suing him when he sat for a deposition last year at her Manhattan office.


Video made public Friday of the seven-hour, closed-door session last April shows the Republican presidential front runner’s demeanor going from calm and cool to indignant — at one point ripping Attorney General Letitia James lawsuit against him as a "disgrace" and "a terrible thing."


Sitting with arms folded, an incredulous Trump complained to the state lawyer questioning him that he was being forced to "justify myself to you" after decades of success building a real estate empire that’s now threatened by the court case.


Trump, who contends James’ lawsuit is part of a politically motivated "witch hunt" was demonstrative from the outset. The video shows him smirking and pouting as the attorney general, a Democrat, introduced herself and told him that she was "committed to a fair and impartial legal process."


James’ office released the video Friday in response to requests from media outlets under New York’s Freedom of Information Law. Trump’s lawyers previously posted a transcript of his remarks to the trial docket in August.


James’ lawsuit accuses Trump, his company and top executives of defrauding banks, insurers and others by inflating his wealth and exaggerating the value of assets on annual financial statements used to secure loans and make deals.


Judge Arthur Engoron, who will decide the case because a jury is not allowed in this type of lawsuit, has said he hopes to have a ruling by the end of January.


Friday’s video is a rare chance for the public at large to see Trump as a witness.


Cameras were not permitted in the courtroom when Trump testified on November 6, nor were they allowed for closing arguments in the case on January 11, where Trump defied the judge and gave a six-minute diatribe after his lawyers spoke.


Here are the highlights from Trump’s videotaped deposition:


‘You don’t have a case'


Telling James and her staff, "you don’t have a case," Trump insisted the banks she alleges were snookered with lofty valuations suffered no harm, got paid in his deals, and "to this day have no complaints."


"Do you know the banks made a lot of money?" Trump asked, previewing his later trial testimony. "Do you know I don’t believe I ever got even a default notice and, even during COVID, the banks were all paid. And yet you’re suing on behalf of banks, I guess. It’s crazy. The whole case is crazy."


Banks "want to do business with me because I’m rich," Trump told James. "But you know what, they’re petrified to do business because of you."


Trump complained New York authorities "spend all their time investigating me, instead of stopping violent crime in the streets."


He said they’d put his recently jailed ex-finance chief Allen Weisselberg "through hell and back" for dodging taxes on company-paid perks.


At a previous deposition in the case, in August 2022, Trump invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and refused to answer questions more than 400 times. He said he did so because he was certain his answers would be used as a basis for criminal charges.


Don’t take my word for it


Trump said he never felt his financial statements "would be taken very seriously," and that people who did business with him were given ample warning not to trust them.


Trump described the statements as "a fairly good compilation of properties" rather than a true representation of their value. Some numbers, he noted, were "guesstimates."


Trump claimed the statements were mainly for his use, though he conceded financial institutions sometimes asked for them. Even then, he insisted it didn’t matter legally if they were accurate or not, because they came with a disclaimer.


"I have a clause in there that says, ’Don’t believe the statement. Go out and do your own work," Trump testified. "You’re supposed to pay no credence to what we say whatsoever."


What’s in a name? $10 billion


Trump estimated that his "brand" alone is worth "maybe $10 billion."


He called it "the most valuable asset I have" and attributed his political success to the ubiquity of his name and persona.


"I became president because of the brand, OK," Trump said. "I became president. I think it’s the hottest brand in the world."


‘Most important job in the world’


After Trump was elected, he put the Trump Organization into a trust overseen by his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and longtime finance chief, Weisselberg.


Trump claimed he did so not because it was required but because he wanted to be a "legitimate president" and avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest.


Plus, Trump said, he was busy solving the world’s problems — like preventing North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un from launching a nuclear attack.


"I considered this the most important job in the world, saving millions of lives," Trump testified. "I think you would have nuclear holocaust if I didn’t deal with North Korea. I think you would have a nuclear war, if I weren’t elected. And I think you might have a nuclear war now, if you want to know the truth."


Obstructed view


In one of his more animated moments, Trump urged his inquisitors to look right out the window for a view of his 40 Wall Street office tower — just across the street from James' office where he testified.


Asked how the building was doing, financially, Trump gestured toward the building with his thumb and answered: "Good. It’s right here. Would you like to see it?"


"I don’t think we’re allowed to open the windows," state lawyer Kevin Wallace said.


"Open the curtain," Trump suggested, bobbing his head around waiting for someone to oblige.


"No," Wallace said.


"Open the curtain, go ahead," Trump said. "It’s right here. I just looked out the window."


"Can’t open it?" defense lawyer Clifford Robert asked, after a beat.


"I wouldn’t," Wallace said.


‘Beautiful’ and ’incredible’


Trump showed off his knack for superlatives, uttering the words "beautiful" and "incredible" 15 times each and "phenomenal" six times as he described his properties.


Trump called his Turnberry, Scotland, golf course "one of the most iconic places in the world," and the renovated villas at his Doral golf resort near Miami "the most beautiful rooms you’ve ever seen."


Trump described his 213-acre Seven Springs estate north of New York City as "the greatest house in New York State."


His golf courses in Aberdeen, Scotland? "Really incredible." Jupiter, Florida? "An incredible facility." Just outside Los Angeles? "An incredible property … an unbelievable property ... a phenomenal property that fronts on the ocean."


"I don’t want to sell any of them," Trump testified. "But if I ever sold them — if I ever put some of these things up for sale — I would get numbers that were staggering."


He said he could get $1.5 billion for his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and maybe $2.5 billion for Doral.


Trump suggested he could get "a fortune" from the Saudi Arabia-backed LIV golf league for the Turnberry course, a former British Open site.


"There would be people that would do anything to own Doral. There are people that would do anything to own Turnberry or Mar-a-Lago or ... Trump Tower or 40 Wall Street," he added.
