<h2 id="ready-to-come-out-scientists-emerge-after-year-on-mars">‘Ready
to come out?’ Scientists emerge after year ‘on Mars’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The NASA astronaut knocks loudly three times on what
appears to be a nondescript door and calls cheerfully: “You ready to
come out?” </p>
<p>The reply is inaudible, but beneath his mask he appears to be
grinning as he yanks the door open, and four scientists who have spent a
year away from all other human contact, simulating a mission to Mars,
spill out to cheers and applause. </p>
<p>Anca Selariu, Ross Brockwell, Nathan Jones and team leader Kelly
Haston have spent the past 378 days sealed inside the “Martian” habitat
in Houston, Texas, part of NASA’s research into what it will take to put
humans on the Red Planet.  </p>
<p>They have been growing vegetables, conducting “Marswalks,” and
operating under what NASA terms “additional stressors,” such as
communication delays with “Earth,” including their families; isolation
and confinement.  </p>
<p>It’s the kind of experience that would make anyone who lived through
pandemic lockdowns shudder, but all four were beaming as they reemerged
Saturday, their hair slightly more unruly and their emotion apparent.
 </p>
<p>“Hello. It’s actually so wonderful just to be able to say hello to
you,” Haston, a biologist, said with a laugh. </p>
<p>“I really hope I don’t cry standing up here in front of all of you,”
Jones, an emergency room doctor, said as he took to the microphone, and
nearly doing just that several moments later as he spotted his wife in
the crowd.  </p>
<p>The habitat, dubbed Mars Dune Alpha, is a 3D-printed,
160-square-meter facility, complete with bedrooms, a gym, common areas,
and a vertical farm for growing food. </p>
<p>An outdoor area, separated by an airlock, is filled with red sand and
is where the team donned suits to conduct their “Marswalks,” though it
is still covered rather than being open air. </p>
<p>“They have spent more than a year in this habitat conducting crucial
science, most of it nutrition-based and how that impacts their
performance … as we prepare to send people on to the Red Planet,” Steve
Koerner told the crowd. Koerner is the deputy director at NASA’s Johnson
Space Center. </p>
<p>“I’m very appreciative,” he added. </p>
<p>This mission is the first of a series of three planned by NASA,
grouped under the title CHAPEA — Crew Health and Performance Exploration
Analog. </p>
<p>A yearlong mission simulating life on Mars took place in 2015-2016 in
a habitat in Hawaii, and although NASA participated in it, it was not at
the helm. </p>
<p>Under its Artemis program, America plans to send humans back to the
Moon to learn how to live there long-term to help prepare a trip to
Mars, sometime towards the end of the 2030s.</p>

records may shatter as excessive heat threatens 130 million</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>portland, oregon — Roughly 130 million people were under threat
Saturday and into next week from a long-running heat wave that already
has broken records with dangerously high temperatures — and is expected
to shatter more from East Coast to West Coast, forecasters said. </p>
<p>Oppressive heat and humidity could team up to spike temperatures
above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (about 38 degrees Celsius) in parts of the
Pacific Northwest, the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast, said Jacob
Asherman, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. </p>
<p>In Oregon, records could be broken in cities including Eugene,
Portland and Salem, Asherman said. Dozens of other records throughout
the U.S. could fall, Asherman added, causing millions to seek relief
from the blanket of heat in cooling centers from Bullhead City, Arizona,
to Norfolk, Virginia. </p>
<p>The National Weather Service said Saturday it was extending the
excessive heat warning for much of the Southwest into Friday. </p>
<p>“A dangerous and historic heatwave is just getting started across the
area, with temperatures expected to peak during the Sunday-Wednesday
timeframe,” the National Weather Service in Las Vegas said in an updated
forecast. </p>
<p>Excessive heat will likely continue through Friday, the service
said. </p>
<p>In sweltering Las Vegas, where the temperature hit 100 F (37.7 C) by
10:30 a.m., Marko Boscovich said the best way to beat the heat is in a
seat at a slot machine with a cold beer inside an air-conditioned
casino. </p>
<p>“But you know, after it hits triple digits it’s about all the same to
me,” said Boscovich, who was visiting from Sparks, Nevada, to see a Dead
&amp; Company concert later Saturday night at the Sphere. “Maybe they’ll
play one of my favorites — ‘Cold Rain and Snow.’” </p>
<p>Heat records being shattered across the southwest </p>
<p>By 10:30 a.m. Saturday, the National Weather Service said the
temperature already had risen to 100 F (36.6 C) in Phoenix, which saw a
record high of 118 F (47.7 C) for Friday. </p>
<p>Meteorologists predict temperatures will be near daily records
region-wide through most, if not all, of the coming week with lower
desert highs reaching 115 to 120 F (46.1 to 48.8 C). </p>
<p>Rare heat advisories had been extended even into the upper
elevations, including around Lake Tahoe, with the National Weather
Service in Reno, Nevada, warning of “major heat risk impacts, even in
the mountains.” </p>
<p>“How hot are we talking? Well, high temperatures across (western
Nevada and northeastern California) won’t get below 100 degrees (37.8 C)
until next weekend,” the service posted online. “And unfortunately,
there won’t be much relief overnight either.” </p>
<p>A new heat record for the day was set Friday in California’s Death
Valley — one of the hottest places on Earth — with the mercury climbing
to 127 F (52.8 C). The old mark of 122 F (50 C) was last tied in
2013. </p>
<p>Palm Springs, California, hit 124 F (51.1 C) Friday, breaking the
city’s record of 123 F (50.5 C). </p>
<p>More extreme highs are in the near forecast, including 129 F (53.8
degrees C) for Sunday at Furnace Creek in Death Valley National Park,
and then around 130 (54.4 C) through Wednesday. The hottest temperature
ever officially recorded on Earth was 134 degrees (56.67 C) in Death
Valley in July 1913, though some experts dispute that measurement and
say the real record was 130 F (54.4 C) recorded there in July 2021. </p>
<p>Worst is yet to come </p>
<p>The worst was yet to come across much of the West, with triple-digit
temperatures likely higher than average into next week, the National
Weather Service said.  </p>
<p>The Eastern U.S. also was bracing for more hot temperatures.
Baltimore and other parts of Maryland were under an excessive heat
warning, as heat index values could climb to 110 F (43 C), forecasters
said.</p>
<p>Heat-related deaths mounting </p>
<p>In Arizona’s Maricopa County, which encompasses Phoenix, there have
been at least 13 confirmed heat-related deaths this year, along with
more than 160 other suspected heat deaths are still under investigation,
according to the county’s most recent report. </p>
<p>That does not include the death of a 10-year-old boy this week in
Phoenix who suffered a “heat-related medical event” while hiking with
family at South Mountain Park and Preserve, according to police.</p>

<h2 id="android-15-could-include-a-desktop-mode-but-what-for">Android 15
could include a desktop mode — but what for?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>If there was ever a “will they, won’t they?” love story in mobile
computing, it’s definitely Google’s on and off again relationship with
Android’s desktop mode. There have been countless hints, efforts, and
code pertaining to the mythical desktop mode for Android, but so far,
Google has never flipped the switch and made it available. It’s 2024,
Android 15 development is in full swing, and it seems Google and
Android’s desktop mode are dating again. This past spring, Google added
DisplayPort support to the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro in a Feature Drop
update, allowing for easy wired connections to external monitors. Then,
tinkering in Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2.1, Mishaal Rahman was able to get a
new desktop interface up and running, complete with Android apps running
in resizeable floating windows. It’s not confirmed that Android 15 will
ship with a built-in desktop mode, but the bones are there. It does make
me wonder, though: why? What would a desktop interface add to Android? ↫
Taylor Kerns at Android Police I’m actually fairly convinced Android
could, indeed, serve as an excellent desktop operating system, but
without any official backing by Google, it’s always been a massive hack
to use Android with a mouse and keyboard. It’s not so much the hardware
support – it’s all there – but rather the software support, and the
clunky way common Android UI tasks feel when performing them with a
mouse. I’ve installed Android desktop ‘distributions’ countless times,
and the third-party hacks they use, like clunky taskbars and custom
menus and so on, make for a horrid user experience. Samsung DEX seems to
be the only somewhat successful attempt at adding a desktop mode to
Android, but it can’t be installed on any regular PC or laptop, and
requires cumbersome cabling or expensive docks, making it more of a
curiosity than a true desktop mode in the sense most of us are thinking
of. This feature needs to come from Google itself, and it needs to be
something third parties can use in their ROMs and x86 builds so we can
truly use Android on a desktop. I don’t believe that’s going to happen,
though. It’s clear Google is more interested in pushing Chrome OS for
desktop and laptop use, and it seems more likely that any desktop mode
that gets added to Android is going to be similar in nature to DEX –
something you can only use by hooking up your phone to a display and
configuring wireless input devices. Cool, but not exactly something that
will turn Android into a desktop contender.</p>

I think I sense a theme in Final Cut Pro UI elements: it goes out of its
way to avoid using the system keyboard for data entry.

And come to think of it, the TextField with a keyboard is really a bad

Lots of wasted space when all you need are the top row, “.” and

coast braces for Beryl, expected to regain hurricane strength</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>houston, texas — Texas officials Saturday urged coastal residents to
brace for a potential hit by Beryl as the storm is expected to regain
hurricane strength in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. </p>
<p>“We’re expecting the storm to make landfall somewhere on the Texas
coast sometime Monday, if the current forecast is correct,” said Jack
Beven, a senior hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center in
Miami. “Should that happen, it’ll most likely be a Category 1
hurricane.” </p>
<p>The earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the
Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the
Caribbean islands earlier in the week. It then battered Mexico as a
Category 2 hurricane, toppling trees but causing no injuries or deaths
before weakening to a tropical storm as it moved across the Yucatan
Peninsula. </p>
<p>Texas officials warned the state’s entire coastline to brace for
possible flooding, heavy rain and wind as they wait for a more defined
path of the storm. The hurricane center has issued hurricane and storm
surge warnings from Baffin Bay south of Corpus Christi to San Luis Pass,
less than 80 miles (130 kilometers) south of Houston. </p>
<p>Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, the acting governor while
Governor Greg Abbott is traveling in Taiwan, issued a preemptive
disaster declaration for 121 counties.  </p>
<p>“Beryl is a determined storm, and incoming winds and potential
flooding will pose a serious threat to Texans who are in Beryl’s path at
landfall and as it makes its way across the state for the following 24
hours,” Patrick said in a statement Saturday.</p>
<p>Some Texas coastal cities called for voluntary evacuations in
low-lying areas prone to flooding, banned beach camping, and urged
tourists traveling on the July 4 holiday weekend to move recreational
vehicles from coastal parks. </p>
<p>Mitch Thames, a spokesperson for Matagorda County, said Saturday that
officials issued a voluntary evacuation request for the coastal areas of
the county about 160 kilometers (about 99 miles) southwest of Houston to
inform the large number of visitors in the area for the holiday
weekend. </p>
<p>“I certainly don’t want to ruin the holiday weekend for our visitors.
But at the same time, our Number 1 goal is the health and safety of all
our visitors and of course our residents,” Thames said. </p>
<p>Residents secure homes with boards, sandbags</p>
<p>In Corpus Christi, officials asked visitors to cut their trips short
and return home early if possible. Officials asked residents to secure
their homes by boarding up windows if necessary and using sandbags to
guard against possible flooding. </p>
<p>“We’re taking the storm very serious and we’re asking the community
to take the storm very serious as well,” Corpus Christi Fire Chief
Brandon Wade said Friday.  </p>
<p>Traffic has been nonstop for the past three days at Ace Hardware in
Corpus Christi as customers buy up tarps, rope, duct tape, sandbags and
generators, employee Elizabeth Landry said Saturday. </p>
<p>“They’re just worried about the wind, the rain,” she said. “They’re
wanting to prepare just in case.” </p>
<p>Ben Koutsoumbaris, general manager of Island Market on Corpus
Christi’s Padre Island, said there’s “definitely a lot of buzz about the
incoming storm,” with customers stocking up on food and drinks —
particularly meat and beer. </p>
<p>“I heard there’s been some talk about people having like hurricane
parties,” he said by telephone Saturday. </p>
<p>County mandates evacuation</p>
<p>In Refugio County, north of Corpus Christi along Texas’ Gulf Coast,
officials issued a mandatory evacuation order for its 6,700 residents
Saturday. </p>
<p>Refugio County Judge Jhiela “Gigi” Poynter, the county’s top elected
official, said that based on the growing confidence of Beryl’s track and
the uncertainty regarding the storm’s intensity and holiday weekend
traffic that is already backing up roads, she made the decision to call
for the mandatory evacuation. </p>
<p>“I would rather be cautious and let Tropical Storm Beryl come
crawling in with a little bit of rain and a little bit of wind to an
empty Refugio County than the alternative if it were to strengthen more
than the predictions, which we know has happened with several storms in
the past,” Poynter said in a video posted on Facebook. </p>
<p>On Saturday, Beryl was about 615 kilometers (about 382 miles)
southeast of Corpus Christi and had top sustained winds of 95 kilometers
(50 miles) per hour, according to the National Hurricane Center. It was
moving west-northwest at 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) per hour.</p>
<p>Before hitting Mexico and moving into the Gulf, Beryl had already
spread destruction in Jamaica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and
Barbados this week. Three people have been reported dead in Grenada,
three in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, three in Venezuela and two in
Jamaica, officials said.</p>

Beryl spares Mexico’s Yucatan beaches, takes aim at Texas</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CANCUN/TULUM, Mexico — Tropical Storm Beryl was blowing out to the
Gulf of Mexico on Friday afternoon and appeared likely to reach Texas by
late Sunday, after its strong winds and heavy rain largely spared
Mexico’s top beach destinations.</p>
<p>The core of the storm, downgraded from a hurricane, crossed the
Yucatan Peninsula by Friday afternoon, with its maximum wind speeds
slowing to around 105 kph after striking near the coastal beach resort
of Tulum in the morning.</p>
<p>The storm, which at one point intensified to a massive Category 5
hurricane, left a deadly trail of destruction across the Caribbean
earlier this week. However, there were no casualties in Mexico, the head
of the country’s civil protection agency, Laura Velazquez, said in a
press conference on Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>While Beryl’s passage over Mexico’s Quintana Roo and Yucatan states
resulted in slower winds, the U.S. National Hurricane Center still
forecast dangerous storm surges in the surrounding area.</p>
<p>For those who hunkered down as Beryl churned overhead, a sense of
relief prevailed.</p>
<p>“Holy cow! It was an experience!” said Mexican tourist Juan Ochoa,
who was staying in Tulum.</p>
<p>“Really only some plants flew up in the air,” he said. “Thank God
we’re all OK.”</p>
<p>Tourist infrastructure was without major damage in Quintana Roo, the
state government said in a statement.</p>
<p>Still, many in the area lost electricity, including 40% of Tulum,
said Guillermo Nevarez, an official with Mexico’s national electricity
company CFE, speaking to local broadcaster Milenio.</p>
<p>Civil protection chief Velazquez said she expected service to be
restored in full by Sunday.</p>
<p>Among Mexico’s top tourist getaways, the Yucatan Peninsula is known
for its white sand beaches, lush landscapes and Mayan ruins.</p>
<p>Stranded tourists camped out in Cancun’s international airport on
Friday, unsure of when they would make it home.</p>
<p>Nora Vento said her flight home to Chile was postponed multiple
times, and that her airline’s counter was unstaffed.</p>
<p>“So, I don’t know when I will get to Chile,” she said.</p>
<p>Beryl, currently located over the port of Progreso in Mexico’s
Yucatan state, was expected to pick up intensity as it enters the Gulf
of Mexico and forecast to regain hurricane status and approach the
western Gulf coast on Sunday.</p>
<p>A hurricane watch was in effect for the Texas coast from the mouth of
the Rio Grande northward to Sargent, according to the U.S. National
Hurricane Center (NHC).</p>
<p>Mexico’s meteorological service issued a hurricane watch for the
northeastern coast of Mexico from Barra el Mezquital to the mouth of the
Rio Grande.</p>
<p>“There is an increasing risk of damaging hurricane-force winds and
life-threatening storm surge in portions of northeastern Mexico and the
lower and middle Texas Coast late Sunday and Monday where hurricane and
storm surge watches have been issued,” the NHC said.</p>
<p>It warned that flash and urban flooding were possible across portions
of the Texas Gulf Coast and eastern Texas from Sunday through the middle
of next week.</p>
<p>Rainfall of 13 to 25 centimeters, with localized amounts of 38
centimeters, is projected across portions of the Texas Gulf Coast and
eastern Texas beginning late on Sunday through the middle of next
week.</p>
<p>Mexico’s national water commission, CONAGUA, flagged a risk of
flooding around the tourist hubs, as well as in neighboring Campeche
state.</p>
<p>Quintana Roo schools were closed, as were local beaches, and
officials lifted a temporary ban on alcohol sales.</p>
<p>Beryl was the first hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic season, and this
week became the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record, with scientists
pointing to its rapid strengthening as almost certainly fueled by
human-caused climate change.</p>
<p>Before reaching Mexico, Beryl wreaked havoc across several Caribbean
islands. It swept through Jamaica, Grenada, St. Vincent and the
Grenadines, in addition to unleashing heavy rainfall on northern
Venezuela. It has claimed at least 11 lives, tearing apart buildings
while felling power lines and trees.</p>
<p>Destruction in the islands of Grenada was especially pronounced.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell pointed to major damage to homes in
Grenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique during a video briefing
Thursday night. Parts of the latter two islands suffered “almost
complete devastation,” he said.</p>
<p>“Many of our citizens have lost everything.”</p>
<p>Mexico’s major oil platforms, primarily located in the southern rim
of the Gulf of Mexico, are not expected to be affected or shut down.</p>
<p>Beryl is also expected to have little impact on U.S. offshore oil and
gas production, energy companies said on Friday while evacuating
personnel from some facilities out of caution.</p>
<p>Research by the ClimaMeter consortium determined that climate change
significantly intensified Beryl. According to the study, the storm’s
severity, along with its associated rainfall and wind speed, saw an
increase of 10%-30% as a direct result of climate change.</p>

focus on Harris as talk of replacing Biden intensifies</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — For years it’s been a Republican scare tactic.</p>
<p>A vote to reelect President Joe Biden, the GOP often charges, is
really a vote for Vice President Kamala Harris. It’s an attack line
sometimes tinged with racist and misogynist undertones and often macabre
imagery.</p>
<p>But after Biden’s dismal performance at last week’s presidential
debate, which has sparked Democratic calls for him to step aside, what
was once dismissed as a far-right conspiracy — Harris replacing Biden —
could now have a chance of coming to pass. And Republicans, including
Donald Trump, are ramping up their attacks.</p>
<p>Trump and his allies have been rolling out new attack lines against
Harris, insulting her abilities, painting her as Biden’s chief enabler
and accusing her of being part of a coverup of his health. It’s an
effort, campaign officials insist, is not a reflection of their concerns
about a potential change at the top of the ticket, given Biden’s
insistence he is not leaving the race.</p>
<p>But in a post marking Independence Day on his Truth Social site
Thursday, Trump singled out Harris, calling her his “potentially new
Democrat Challenger” and giving her a new derisive nickname: “Laffin’
Kamala Harris.”</p>
<p>“She did poorly in the Democrat Nominating process, starting out at
Number Two, and ending up defeated and dropping out, even before getting
to Iowa, but that doesn’t mean she’s not a”highly talented” politician!
Just ask her Mentor, the Great Willie Brown of San Francisco,” he wrote.
(Harris dated Brown in the mid-1990s.)</p>
<p>The post came after Trump campaign senior advisers Chris LaCivita and
Susie Wiles released a statement earlier this week that offered a
different, but similar, moniker, calling her Biden’s “Cackling Copilot
Kamala Harris.”</p>
<p>Trump also posted an expletive-laced video, which was first been
reported by The Daily Beast, in which he was captured on the golf course
calling Biden an “old broken-down pile of crap” and declaring that he’d
driven the president from the race. (Trump, in interviews, has
repeatedly said he did not expect Biden to be pushed aside.)</p>
<p>“He’s quitting the race,” Trump said. “And that means we have Kamala.
I think she’s going to be better. She’s so bad. She’s so pathetic,” he
said.</p>
<p>Allies have also joined the attacks, painting Harris as a chief
defender of Biden’s faculties and accusing her of lying to the American
public.</p>
<p>Biden, the White House and his campaign insist he has no plans to
drop out of the race. He told reporters Friday he was “completely ruling
that out.”</p>
<p>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre pushed back against
the tenor of attacks against Harris, particularly Trump’s decision to
invoke a decades-old relationship.</p>
<p>“I think it’s gross, I think it’s disturbing,” Jean-Pierre told
reporters Friday aboard Air Force One. “She should be respected in the
role that she has as vice president. She should be respected like any
other vice president before her who was in that room. It is appalling
that, I’m going to be careful here, that a former president is saying
that about a current vice president. And we should call that out — it is
not OK.”</p>
<p>It remains unclear how Harris would fare against Trump, compared to
Biden. Replacing a candidate this late in a presidential cycle — much
less an incumbent president who has already sailed through the
Democratic Party’s primaries — would be unprecedented in modern history,
and the mechanics are complicated and potentially messy.</p>
<p>Polling shows that Harris’ favorability ratings are similar to
Biden’s and Trump’s. A June AP-NORC poll found about 4 in 10 Americans
have a favorable opinion of her. But the share of those who have an
unfavorable opinion is slightly lower than for Trump and Biden, and
about 1 in 10 have no opinion of her yet.</p>
<p>Harris, at 59, would be a marked generational contrast to Trump, who
is 78 and has also shown signs of aging. As the first woman, the first
Black person and the first person of South Asian descent to serve as
vice president, she would also chart a potentially barrier-breaking
candidacy that could draw the support of women, minority voters and
younger people — groups with whom Trump has been working to make
significant inroads.</p>
<p>Harris has also been the Biden administration’s leading voice on
abortion rights, an animating issue for Democrats since the overturning
of Roe v. Wade that could again motivate turnout this fall.</p>
<p>Trump’s campaign, however, said it was confident in Trump’s chances
regardless of his opponent and dismissed the idea that Harris might pose
a greater challenge to Trump, seeing her as a more polarizing figure
than the president.</p>

id="heat-wave-scorches-much-of-us-record-setting-temperatures-predicted">Heat
wave scorches much of US; record-setting temperatures predicted</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>portland, oregon — A slow-moving and potentially record-setting heat
wave is spreading across the Western United States, the National Weather
Service said, sending many residents in search of a cool haven from the
dangerously high temperatures.</p>
<p>The Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. are also
sweltering, with oppressive heat and humidity expected to last through
Saturday.</p>
<p>Widespread temperature records are expected to be tied or even broken
during the heat wave, with much of the West Coast likely to see
temperatures that are between 15- and 30-degrees Fahrenheit (8 and 16
degrees Celsius) higher than average, the National Weather Service
said.</p>
<p>“The duration of this heat is also concerning, as scorching above
average temperatures are forecast to linger into next week,” the weather
service said.</p>
<p>In the Portland, Oregon, suburb of Gresham, Sherri Thompson, 52, was
waiting in her car with her 14-year-old Chihuahua Kiwani for a cooling
center to open late Friday morning. Thompson has lived in her car for
three years and can only run its air conditioning for about 20 minutes
at a time as it causes the engine to overheat.</p>
<p>Thompson said the high temperatures prompted health concerns, as she
has been hospitalized for heat stroke in the past.</p>
<p>“I have anxiety and panic attacks and I get worried,” she said. “I
don’t want to have another heat stroke, and everything just triggers my
anxiety a lot.” </p>
<p>Pavement, sidewalks magnify heat</p>
<p>Inside the air-conditioned center, Multnomah County spokesperson
Julia Comnes oversaw county staff and people working with a local
homeless services provider as they lined up thin mattresses in rows on
the floor and set up cots for people with disabilities. She said the
space had capacity for up to 80 people.</p>
<p>“We had a pretty cool June, so our bodies aren’t totally acclimated
yet to the heat,” she said. “For people living outside or more
vulnerable people, the cooling space like this is really important for
them to just cool off for a few hours.”</p>
<p>The blistering weather in the Portland region is expected to last at
least through Monday, National Weather Service meteorologist Clinton
Rockey said. If the triple-digit Fahrenheit temperatures (well over 37
degrees Celsius) stretch into Tuesday, then the region will match a
record last seen in July 1941, with five consecutive days of more than
100-degree weather, Rockey said.</p>
<p>The duration is a problem: Many homes in the area lack air
conditioning, and round-the-clock hot weather means people’s bodies
can’t cool down at night. The issue is compounded in many city settings,
where concrete and pavement can store the heat, essentially acting as an
oven.</p>
<p>“That’s what drives people batty,” Rockey said. “It’s going to be
obnoxious. And unfortunately for some people, if you’re not having good
shelter, it could be a very challenging, life-threatening
situation.”</p>
<p>Heat leads to 13 deaths</p>
<p>In Arizona’s Maricopa County, which encompasses the city of Phoenix,
there have been at least 13 confirmed heat-related deaths this year,
while the causes of more than 160 other suspected heat deaths were still
under investigation, according to the county’s most recent report on
such deaths through June 29.</p>
<p>That doesn’t include the death of a 10-year-old boy earlier this week
in Phoenix, who suffered a “heat-related medical event” while hiking
with his family at South Mountain Park and Preserve, according to the
Phoenix Police Department.</p>
<p>Among extremes, the forecast for Furnace Creek in Death Valley
National Park calls for daytime highs of 129 degrees Fahrenheit (53.8
degrees Celsius) Sunday, and then around 130 F (54.44 C) through
Wednesday. The official world record for hottest temperature recorded on
Earth was 134 degrees F (56.67 C) in Death Valley in July 1913, but some
experts dispute that measurement and say the real record was 130 F
recorded there in July 2021.</p>
<p>At Bullhead City, Arizona, the temperature already had reached 111 F
(44.4 C) by 11 a.m. Friday. The city opened a pair of cooling centers
for seniors and others, but locals seemed to be taking it in stride.</p>
<p>“While this is a heat wave and we urge everyone to be cautious, we
typically don’t see large attendance at our cooling centers unless there
are power outages,” Bullhead City spokesperson Mackenzie Covert said
Friday.</p>
<p>Figure skaters took to the ice at the Reno Ice Rink in Nevada
starting at 6 a.m. Friday, general manager Kevin Sunde said. By the time
the rink closes at 10:30 p.m. Friday, Sunde expected nearly 300 people
would have visited, with more parents hanging around to watch kids’
hockey practice than usual.</p>
<p>“They may not be getting on the ice themselves, but enjoying the
cool,” Sunde said. “We’re the only sheet of ice within about an hour’s
drive.”</p>

id="trump-denies-knowledge-of-project-2025-allies-plan-to-transform-us-government">Trump
denies knowledge of Project 2025, allies’ plan to transform US
government</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>miami — Donald Trump distanced himself Friday from Project 2025, a
massive, proposed overhaul of the federal government drafted by longtime
allies and former officials in his administration — days after the head
of the think tank responsible for the program suggested there would be a
second American Revolution.  </p>
<p>“I know nothing about Project 2025,” Trump posted on his social media
website. “I have no idea who is behind it. I disagree with some of the
things they’re saying and some of the things they’re saying are
absolutely ridiculous and abysmal. Anything they do, I wish them luck,
but I have nothing to do with them.”</p>
<p>Plan expands presidential power</p>
<p>The 922-page plan outlines a dramatic expansion of presidential power
and a plan to fire as many as 50,000 government workers to replace them
with Trump loyalists.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign has worked to draw more
attention to the agenda, particularly as Biden tries to keep fellow
Democrats on board after his disastrous debate. </p>
<p>Trump has outlined his own plans to remake the government if he wins
a second term, including staging the largest deportation operation in
U.S. history and imposing tariffs on potentially all imports. His
campaign has previously warned outside allies not to presume to speak
for the former president and suggested their transition-in-waiting
efforts were unhelpful. </p>
<p>‘The second American Revolution’</p>
<p>Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts said on Steve Bannon’s
“War Room” podcast Tuesday that Republicans are “in the process of
taking this country back.” Former U.S. Representative Dave Brat of
Virginia hosted the show for Bannon, who is serving a four-month prison
term.   </p>
<p>“We are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will
remain bloodless if the left allows it to be,” Roberts said. </p>
<p>Those comments were widely circulated online and blasted by the Biden
campaign, which issued a statement saying Trump and his allies were
“dreaming of a violent revolution to destroy the very idea of
America.” </p>
<p>Some of the people involved in Project 2025 are former senior
administration officials. The project’s director is Paul Dans, who
served as chief of staff at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management
under Trump. Trump’s campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt was featured
in one of Project 2025’s videos. </p>
<p>John McEntee, a former director of the White House Presidential
Personnel Office in the Trump administration, is a senior adviser.
McEntee told the conservative news site The Daily Wire this year that
Project 2025’s team would integrate a lot of its work with the campaign
after the summer when Trump would announce his transition team.   </p>
<p>Trump’s comments on Project 2025 come ahead of the Republican Party’s
meetings next week to begin to draft its party platform. </p>
<p>Project 2025 has been preparing its own 180-day agenda for the next
administration that it plans to share privately, rather than as part of
its public-facing book of priorities for a Republican president. A key
Trump ally, Russ Vought, who contributed to Project 2025 and is drafting
this final pillar, is also on the Republican National Committee’s
platform writing committee. </p>
<p>A spokesperson for the plan said Project 2025 is not tied to a
specific candidate or campaign.   </p>
<p>“We are a coalition of more than 110 conservative groups advocating
policy and personnel recommendations for the next conservative
president,” a statement said. “But it is ultimately up to that
president, who we believe will be President Trump, to decide which
recommendations to implement.”   </p>
<p>Plan ‘should scare’ Americans, say Democrats </p>
<p>The Democratic National Committee said the plan and the Trump
campaign are part of the same “MAGA operation.” A Biden campaign
spokesperson said that Project 2025 staff members are also leading the
Republican policy platform. </p>
<p>“Project 2025 is the extreme policy and personnel playbook for
Trump’s second term that should scare the hell out of the American
people,” said Ammar Moussa.   </p>
<p>On Thursday, as the country celebrated Independence Day and Biden
prepared for his television interview after his halting debate
performance, the president’s campaign posted on X a shot from the
dystopian TV drama “The Handmaid’s Tale” showing a group of women in the
show’s red dresses and white hats standing in formation by a reflecting
pool with a cross at the far end where the Washington Monument should
be. The story revolves around women who are stripped of their identities
and forced to give birth to children for other couples in a totalitarian
regime. </p>
<p>“Fourth of July under Trump’s Project 2025,” the post said.</p>

is bringing Fuchsia OS to Android devices, but not in the way you’d
think</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>To evolve Fuchsia beyond smart home devices, Google has been working
on projects such as Starnix to run unmodified Linux binaries on Fuchsia
devices. In addition, since late April of this year, Google has been
working on a new project called “microfuchsia” that aims to make Fuchsia
bootable on existing devices via virtualization. Microfuchsia, according
to Google, is a Fuchsia OS build that targets virtual machines and is
designed to be bootable in virtualization solutions such as QEMU and
pKVM. ↫ Mishaal Rahman at Android Authority The goal here might be,
according to Mishaal Rahman, might be to use this new microfuchsia thing
to replace the stripped-down Android version that’s currently being used
inside Android’s pKVM to run certain secured workloads. Relevant patches
have been submitted to both the Fuchsia and Android side of things for
this very purpose. At this point, it really seems that Google’s grand
ambitions with Fuchsia simply didn’t survive the massive employee
culling, with leadership probably reasoning that Android and Chrome OS
are good enough, and that replacing them with something homegrown and
possibly more suited – speculation, of course – simply isn’t worth the
investment in both time and money. It probably makes sense from a
financial standpoint, but it’s still sad.</p>

<h2 id="us-refutes-russias-denial-of-violating-north-korea-sanctions">US
refutes Russia’s denial of violating North Korea sanctions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The United States has flatly rejected Russia’s claim
that it has not violated international sanctions imposed on North Korea,
calling on Moscow to stop illegal arms transfers from Pyongyang.</p>
<p>“The U.S. and like-minded countries have successfully highlighted
Russia’s U.N. Security Council Resolutions violations,” a State
Department spokesperson said in an email to VOA’s Korean Service on
Wednesday, responding to an inquiry made about Russia’s denial of
violating North Korea sanctions.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, we now have a permanent member of the U.N. Security
Council willing to openly flout sanctions to support the Kim [Jong Un]
regime’s priorities.”</p>
<p>The spokesperson continued: “We call on the DPRK and Russia to cease
unlawful arms transfers and urge the DPRK to take concrete steps toward
abandoning all nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles, and related
programs.” DPRK stands for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,
North Korea’s official name.</p>
<p>In a Monday press conference, Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily
Nebenzia insisted that his country had complied with international
sanctions against North Korea.</p>
<p>“We’re not violating the North Korea sanctions regime and all those
allegations that come out. They are not proved by material evidence,” he
said.</p>
<p>The Russian ambassador went even further, questioning the integrity
of a now-defunct U.N. panel of experts charged with monitoring North
Korea sanctions. The panel’s annual mandate was not extended this year,
following Russia’s veto at the U.N. Security Council in March.</p>
<p>Nebenzia alleged that the panel of experts got involved in the
politics after being encouraged by certain countries, adding that “that
was the major mistake that they made.”</p>
<p>“The sanctions regime against DPRK is an unprecedented thing in the
United Nations. It’s not time bound. It doesn’t have any provisions for
reviewing, and this cannot be tolerated.”</p>
<p>The Kremlin’s refusal to renew the expert panel’s annual mandate
marked a drastic change from its earlier support for U.N. Resolution
1718, which put in place an arms embargo on North Korea by banning all
imports and exports of most weapons and related material.</p>
<p>The U.N. Security Council passed the resolution unanimously in
October 2006, just several days after North Korea’s first nuclear
test.</p>
<p>This week’s exchange between Washington and Moscow comes as Russia
has been deepening military ties with North Korea.</p>
<p>Russian President Vladmir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un
signed a comprehensive strategic partnership treaty during their summit
in Pyongyang last month.</p>
<p>In recent months. the U.S. government has repeatedly blown the
whistle on Russia’s alleged violations of international sanctions,
accusing Moscow of financially and materially facilitating Pyongyang’s
efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>In a May briefing, White House national security spokesperson John
Kirby released specific figures of the refined oil Russia has provided
to North Korea so far this year, stressing it has already exceeded the
limit set by the U.N. Security Council.</p>
<p>“Russia has been shipping refined petroleum to the DPRK. Russian
shipments have already pushed DPRK inputs above [those] mandated by the
U.N. Security Council. In March alone, Russia shipped more than 165,000
barrels of refined petroleum to the DPRK,” Kirby said.</p>
<p>In October last year, the White House released three satellite images
showing containers moved by ships and trains, saying North Korea had
provided Russia with more than 1,000 containers of military equipment
and ammunition.</p>
<p>Experts in Washington say this standoff between the U.S. and Russia
over North Korea will likely persist for some time.</p>
<p>Scott Snyder, president of the Korea Economic Institute of America,
told VOA’s Korean Service via email on Thursday that the recent defense
pact between Moscow and Pyongyang is not something the U.S. can afford
to ignore.</p>
<p>“North Korea will remain a source of conflict in U.S.-Russia
relations as long as North Korea sustains their strategic relationship,
which will continue at least until the end of military hostilities in
Ukraine,” Snyder said.</p>
<p>Evans Revere, who formerly served as deputy assistant secretary of
state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said in an email to VOA’s
Korean Service on Friday that Russia is setting itself up as North
Korea’s backer.</p>
<p>“Russia has made it clear that it intends to oppose U.N. Security
Council sanctions, work with North Korea and others to find ways to get
around current U.N. Security Council restrictions and strengthen its
tactical and strategic coordination with North Korea,” Revere said.</p>
<p>“Russia, which was once part of the important coalition supporting
the use of pressure and sanctions to deal with Pyongyang’s nuclear and
missile programs, has now gone over to the other side and become
Pyongyang’s de facto protector.”</p>

bows to Russian censorship once more, removes VPN apps from Russian App
Store</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I broke the news that Mozilla had removed several
anti-censorship Firefox extensions from its store in Russia, and a few
days later I also broke the news they reversed course on their decision
and reinstated the extensions. Perhaps not worthy of a beauty prize, as
a Dutch saying goes, but at least the turnaround time was short, and
they did the right thing in the end. Well, let’s see how Apple is going
to deal with the exact same situation. Novaya Gazeta Europe reports that
bowing under pressure from the same Russian censors that targeted
Mozilla, the company has removed a whole slew of VPN applications used
by Russians to evade the stringent totalitarian censorship laws in the
warmongering nation. Apple has removed several apps offering virtual
private network (VPN) services from the Russian AppStore, following a
request from Roskomnadzor, Russia’s media regulator, independent news
outlet Mediazona reported on Thursday. The VPN services removed by Apple
include leading services such as ProtonVPN, Red Shield VPN, NordVPN and
Le VPN. Those living in Russia will no longer be able to download the
services, while users who already have them on their phones can continue
using them, but will be unable to update them. ↫ Novaya Gazeta Europe
Apple has a long history of falling in line with the demands from
dictators and totalitarian regimes, and Russia is no stranger to telling
Apple what to do. Earlier this year, Apple was ordered to remove an
application developed by the team of the murdered opposition figure
Alexey Navalny, and of course, Apple rolled over and complied. Much like
Apple’s grotesque suck-up behaviour in China, This stands in stark
contrast to Apple’s whining, complaining, and tantrums in the European
Union. It seems Apple finds it more comfortable to operating under
dictators than in democracies.</p>

Beryl destroys homes, uproots trees in Grenada</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — The extent of Hurricane Beryl’s damage became clearer
Friday, as communications were reestablished with the small,
storm-ravaged eastern Caribbean islands and relief began to arrive. </p>
<p>The Grenadian islands of Carriacou and Petit Martinique sustained the
most severe damage when Beryl made landfall Monday as a Category 4 storm
and later saw its winds strengthen to a Category 5. About 11,000 people
inhabit the two islands. </p>
<p>“The desalination plants have been knocked out; all of the cell
towers have been knocked out; all of the fiber optic cables have been
knocked out,” said Simon Springett, the United Nations resident
coordinator for Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean. “The roads are
impassable. We probably have about 95% of the housing stock destroyed.
And by default, all of the local businesses, all the income-generating
activities — and the list goes on.” </p>
<p>Beryl is the first Category 5 hurricane on record in the Atlantic
Ocean in June. The hurricane season runs until November 30 and officials
with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are forecasting
17 to 25 named storms.</p>
<p>Springett, who briefed reporters from Grenada, said communications
were only restored with Carriacou Thursday night. About 9,000 people
live on the island known for its coral reefs and sandy beaches. </p>
<p>“The entire island is completely affected,” he said. </p>
<p>Rough seas hamper delivery of help</p>
<p>Springett said the relief operation has been complicated by extremely
rough seas following the hurricane and airport control towers being
knocked offline. </p>
<p>“So, there is only fly-by visibility,” he said. “Even when things get
into the airport, there are no roads to be able to access the
goods.” </p>
<p>He said a French naval vessel is due to arrive in Carriacou on
Friday. Neighbors Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago also have sent
support. </p>
<p>The United Nations, which has nine agencies active in Grenada
normally, is surging more staff in. Springett said a supply ship would
be arriving Saturday from St. Vincent and the Grenadines to bring aid to
the outer islands of the Grenadines and then continue to Carriacou and
Petite Martinique. </p>
<p>Three islands in St. Vincent and the Grenadines also were hit badly:
Canouan, Union Island and Mayreau. Springett said about 15,500 people
live there. </p>
<p>One confirmed death in Jamaica</p>
<p>Beryl hit Jamaica Wednesday. It was the strongest storm there in over
a decade, but the island was spared the worst. </p>
<p>Dennis Zulu, U.N. resident coordinator for Jamaica, told reporters on
the same briefing call that about 70% of people are without water and
40% without power. </p>
<p>The island is a major tourism destination and Zulu said the
government had moved quickly to reopen the main tourist airport at
Montego Bay and to clear road access to resorts. </p>
<p>“From preliminary assessments, very little harm came to the
infrastructure in terms of tourist hotels and resorts,” Zulu said.  “So
that is really positive.” </p>
<p>He said at least one person was confirmed dead in Jamaica from Beryl
and a flash flood warning remains in effect. There was damage to homes,
but some government shelters were shutting after people had returned
home. </p>
<p>“Jamaica is up and running, if I may say that, and the government is
moving seriously to ensure that,” Zulu said. </p>
<p>The United Nations has made an initial allocation of $1.5 million
from its emergency fund for Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.
Another $2.5 million has been allocated for Jamaica.</p>

<h2 id="psion-opl-when-we-owned-our-devices">Psion OPL: when we owned
our devices</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>We talked about Psion last week, and we’re talking about Psion again
this week. This time, Kian Ryan highlights a very important capability
of Psion’s devices, a capability that’s entirely absent from today’s
mobile devices: a built-in IDE and dedicated programming language so you
can write code and build applications, including ones with a graphical
user interface, right on the device. All Psion devices could run OPL,
either preinstalled on the device or via a DATAPAK memory card. It’s a
BASIC-esque programming language, and while you could develop OPL
programs on your PC in DOS, Psion devices also shipped with an IDE
preinstalled so you could get just as much done on the device itself.
Back then, this wasn’t particularly unique, but these days, mobile
devices have become so locked-down and dumb that developing applications
on-device is basically a non-starter. Which can’t be said about my
current mobile. My mobile is a great device to consume content on, but
it has no built in tools to extend its functionality. If I want to build
an application for it, I have to use another computer to download a
build environment, build the application, sign it, and then transfer the
packaged app to my phone. On the Psion, all the tools are right there,
on my home screen. It does feel like we’re missing an opportunity here.
↫ Kian Ryan They’re entirely right, of course. Our current mobile
devices are faster and technically more capable than ever, but extending
the functionality of your smartphone using the smartphone itself by
writing and compiling code on it is far more cumbersome than it was in
the past. Even my Psion Organiser II LZ64, from 1986, has OPL on it, and
if I took the time to relearn the basic BASIC I once knew, I could
probably still program something useful on it today, almost 40 years
later, without being gatekept by anyone, and without needing any other
device. That’s something quite magical that we’ve lost, and that’s
sad.</p>

id="citing-supreme-court-immunity-ruling-trumps-lawyers-seek-to-freeze-classified-documents-case">Citing
Supreme Court immunity ruling, Trump’s lawyers seek to freeze classified
documents case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Donald Trump asked a federal judge Friday to freeze the
classified documents case against him in light of a Supreme Court ruling
this week that said former presidents have broad immunity from
prosecution.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers told U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon that the
prosecution should be put on pause until she resolves pending defense
motions that assert that Trump is immune from criminal charges in the
case and that special counsel Jack Smith was illegally appointed by the
Justice Department.</p>
<p>Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in a 6-3 opinion Monday that
presidents enjoy absolute immunity from prosecution for actions
involving their core constitutional powers and are presumptively immune
for all other official acts. In a separate concurring opinion, Justice
Clarence Thomas wrote that Smith’s appointment was invalid because there
is “no law establishing” the office of the special counsel.</p>
<p>The request Friday underscores the potentially far-reaching
implications of the high court’s opinion. On Tuesday, sentencing for
Trump’s hush money convictions was postponed until at least September as
the judge in the New York case agreed to weigh the possible impact of
the opinion.</p>
<p>The opinion came in a separate case brought by Smith charging Trump
with plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.
But Trump’s lawyers in the documents case in Florida, where he is
charged with illegally retaining top secret records from his presidency
at his Mar-a-Lago estate, have challenged the indictment on the same
legal grounds raised in Monday’s Supreme Court opinion.</p>
<p>Cannon heard arguments last month on the legality of Smith’s
appointment but did not immediately rule. She has also not ruled on the
immunity question.</p>
<p>“Resolution of these threshold questions is necessary to minimize the
adverse consequences to the institution of the Presidency arising from
this unconstitutional investigation and prosecution,” defense lawyers
wrote as they requested the opportunity to make additional
paperwork.</p>
<p>They said the case should be frozen, with the exception of a
separate, and also unresolved, dispute over an effort by prosecutors to
bar Trump from making public comments that could endanger FBI agents
involved in the case.</p>

<h2 id="people-attacked-by-sharks-in-florida-texas">3 people attacked by
sharks in Florida, Texas</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Sharks attacked three people on beaches in Texas and
Florida on Thursday as the Independence Day weekend got underway,
according to officials, adding to a growing list of such incidents in
the U.S. this summer. </p>
<p>A 21-year-old Ohio man was bitten on his foot while standing in
knee-deep water at Florida’s New Smyrna Beach, said Tamra Malphurs,
interim director of Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue. He was
treated at a hospital for non-life-threatening injuries. </p>
<p>On the same day at South Padre Island on the Gulf Coast of Texas,
four people encountered a shark and two were bitten, according to a
press release by Texas Parks and Wildlife. The two victims were taken to
a hospital, but their conditions were unknown. </p>
<p>There have been 28 reported shark attacks in the U.S. so far this
year, according to the website Tracking Sharks. At least three others,
in addition to Thursday’s attacks, have occurred since June 2, including
a California man who was injured by a great white shark and a man in
Hawaii who was killed by a shark. </p>
<p>Three women were injured by what authorities believed to be a bull
shark in Walton County, Florida, the state where shark attacks are most
frequent, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History’s
International Shark Attack File. </p>
<p>The museum found that unprovoked shark attacks and fatalities around
the world rose slightly in 2023 — there were a total of 69 attacks, 10
of which were fatal. </p>
<p>The U.S. had the most incidents last year with 36 attacks and two
fatalities. The number of shark attacks have trended downward since they
spiked in 2021 with 47 attacks, the most ever recorded by the
museum. </p>
<p>Gavin Naylor, director of the Florida Museum of Natural History’s
shark research program, said that while the numbers may oscillate year
by year, reported shark bites have dropped slightly decade by decade. He
attributes the trend to commercial fisheries reducing global shark
populations. </p>
<p>“But the number of people on beaches keeps going up. And as a few
more shark populations are starting to recover, I think in the next 10
years we may see an increase in incidents,” said Naylor.</p>

id="former-reporter-gets-235000-part-of-lawsuit-over-police-raid-on-newspaper">Former
reporter gets $235,000, part of lawsuit over police raid on
newspaper</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TOPEKA, Kansas — A former reporter for a weekly Kansas newspaper has
agreed to accept $235,000 to settle part of her federal lawsuit over a
police raid on the paper that made a small community the focus of a
national debate over press freedoms.  </p>
<p>The settlement removed the former police chief in Marion from the
lawsuit filed by former Marion County Record reporter Deb Gruver, but it
doesn’t apply to two other officials she sued over the raid: the Marion
County sheriff and the county’s prosecutor. Gruver’s lawsuit is among
five federal lawsuits filed over the raid against the city, the county
and eight current or former elected officials or law enforcement
officers. </p>
<p>Gruver’s attorney did not immediately respond to emails Friday
seeking comment. An attorney for the city, its insurance company, the
former chief and others declined to comment but released a copy of the
June 25 settlement agreement after the Record filed an open records
request. He also provided a copy to The Associated Press.  </p>
<p>Former Police Chief Gideon Cody led the Aug. 11, 2023, raid on the
newspaper’s office, the home of publisher Eric Meyer and the home of a
then-city council member who had been critical of the then-mayor. Marion
is a city of about 1,900 people set among rolling prairie hills about
150 miles (241 kilometers) southwest of Kansas City, Missouri, and the
Record is known for its aggressive coverage of local government. </p>
<p>At the time, Cody said he had evidence that the newspaper, reporter
Phyllis Zorn and the city council member had committed identity theft or
other computer crimes in obtaining information about a local business
owner’s driving record. All his targets said they did nothing illegal,
and no charges were ever filed. </p>
<p>A federal lawsuit filed by Meyer and the newspaper alleges that the
raid caused the death the next day of his 98-year-old mother, who lived
with him, and he and the paper’s attorney have suggested that the raid
was Cody’s response to the paper investigating his background. Cody
seized Gruber’s personal cell phone and had her desk searched; she had
no connection to the driving record but was looking into Cody’s
past. </p>
<p>The raid sparked national outrage, and Cody resigned as chief in
early October, less than two months after the raid. Legal experts have
said the raid likely violated state or federal laws.</p>

General Breedlove says NATO must not capitulate to Russia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The United States will host a NATO summit in Washington
next week, at which more military support for Ukraine in the face of
Russia’s ongoing invasion will top the agenda. </p>
<p>Douglas Jones, deputy U.S. assistant secretary of state for European
and Eurasian Affairs, told VOA earlier this week that NATO will put
forward “concrete ways” to accelerate Ukraine’s eventual membership in
the alliance. </p>
<p>Retired U.S. Air Force four-star General Philip Breedlove was the
commander of U.S. European Command and the 17th Supreme Allied Commander
Europe of NATO Allied Command Operations from 2013 to 2016.  </p>
<p>In an interview with VOA, Breedlove said that NATO should use next
week’s summit to detail how it will help Ukraine “win the war against
Russia and to expel Russian forces from Ukrainian lands.”  </p>
<p>Allowing Russia to keep that Ukrainian territory it has occupied
would amount to “capitulation,” Breedlove said, adding that whoever wins
the U.S. presidential election in November must remember that
capitulation to Russia’s ambitions in Ukraine “is not a way
forward.”  </p>
<p>The following transcript has been edited for brevity and
clarity: </p>
<p>VOA: What are the main challenges for NATO ahead of the summit in
Washington? </p>
<p>Retired four-star U.S. Air Force General Philip Breedlove: I think
the main challenge is going to be how to move forward with Ukraine.
There are quite a number of NATO nations that want to get started on
Ukraine’s program to join [NATO], there are other nations that are not
ready for that yet. And so I think that the compromise is this “bridge”
to NATO, whereby Ukraine will be invited to join in the headquarters on
a U.S. base somewhere. I hear that maybe Wiesbaden [Germany] is that
place. More importantly though, since there will not be a formal offer
to Ukraine for membership, the members of NATO are going to need to
discuss how do we begin to guarantee the security of Ukraine. </p>
<p>VOA: How do you think the elections in Europe and the U.K. will
affect — and maybe already have affected — NATO’s immediate
future?  </p>
<p>Breedlove: So I would broaden that scope. In elections in America,
elections in many of our countries, we see a growing nationalistic
trend, some isolationist trends, and these are all going to have to be
addressed by NATO as a body. Because the strength of NATO is solidarity
first, and so we have to figure out how to maintain that solidarity in
the alliance when we have several nations that are now challenging
norms. NATO has always made it through this. I remind people — and some
of my French friends hate it when I do — but we were once thrown out of
a capital of a NATO country. And so NATO has faced challenges in the
past.  </p>
<p>And I think that NATO will survive this current set of issues as well
and frankly maybe be stronger. The absolute audacity, the criminality,
the inhumane war that [Russian President] Mr. [Vladimir] Putin is waging
on Ukraine is in a way drawing NATO closer together, even though there
are less than perfect conversations about how we should go about fixing
things. Broadly now, people understand what Mr. Putin is, what Russia
represents, and the problems that this is going to give us in the
future. And we see nations now realizing that they have to invest in
their defense.  </p>
<p>VOA: According to Politico, some Trump-aligned national security
experts are saying that he is “mulling a deal” where NATO commits to no
further eastward expansion, specifically into Ukraine and Georgia, and
negotiates with Putin over how much Ukrainian territory “Moscow can
keep” in exchange for a cease-fire. What would that mean for Georgia and
Ukraine?  </p>
<p>Breedlove: So, what you’re talking about, to me, amounts to
capitulation. I don’t believe that Mr. [Donald] Trump would capitulate
in quite that manner to Russia and give in to all of Russia’s demands. I
think what we need to focus on is what changes in respect to Russia in
these conversations, remembering that Russia is a nation that amassed
its army, marched across internationally recognized borders and is now
trying to subjugate one of its neighbors. I do not believe that even
Mr. Trump will sign up to that as an end result. </p>
<p>At some point we will have to sit down at the table, and what it
looks like coming away from the table, I think, is a long way from being
determined. And I do not believe that the American people will support
capitulation. … And so I think that whoever is the next president, as
their team sits down to try to resolve this, we’re going to have to
remember that capitulation is not a way forward. </p>
<p>VOA: If Georgia’s domestic political problems grow, what effect will
that have on its prospects for joining NATO? </p>
<p>Breedlove: I think that the question should be asked like this: if
Russia’s interference in Georgia’s internal affairs continues and gets
worse, what does that mean? Because I believe that there is Russian bad
money and Russian bad people and politics involved in Georgia right now.
Georgia is a hybrid warfare battleground whereby Russia is trying to use
all manner of influence to drag Georgia away from the West and to regain
control of Georgian politics. </p>
<p>VOA: It’s clear that during next week’s summit, Ukraine will not be
offered NATO membership. But apart from the offer to establish a
“bridge” at a NATO base, what do you think can be done to bring Ukraine
and NATO closer together?   </p>
<p>Breedlove: Well, the first thing to do is to help them win this war.
Our policies are very weak. We say things like “we’re going to be there
for as long as it takes” or “we’re going to give them everything they
need.” What we fail to say is — we’re going to be there as long as it
takes to do what? We’re going to give them everything they need to do
what? And that “to do what” should sound something like “to completely
defeat the Russian forces inside of Ukraine and drive them back behind
Russia’s borders.” But we are not doing that. And so one of the most
important things about this upcoming summit … is that we need a
demonstrative public declaratory policy on how we would support Ukraine
to win the war against Russia and to expel Russian forces from Ukrainian
lands.</p>

<h2 id="alaska-public-media-given-boost-for-local-broadcasts">Alaska
Public Media given boost for local broadcasts</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — A grant of nearly $1 million is being provided to Alaska
Public Media as part of a two-year plan to strengthen local news for
rural communities.</p>
<p>The nonprofit Cooperation for Public Broadcasting, or CPB, awarded
the $936,000 grant to the Alaska Public Media, which is made up of radio
and TV media outlets.</p>
<p>Lori Townsend, news director for Alaska Public Media, or APM, said
the funding will help deepen “the connection between the local community
and its public broadcasting station.”</p>
<p>Investing in this way, she told VOA via email, means “the community
will continue to support the local and regional journalism they can only
get from their local newsroom.”</p>
<p>Townsend said the grant will allow Alaska Public Radio to help rural
station partners better reach remote areas that have less coverage.</p>
<p>An NPR-member station, Alaska Public Radio produces national and
state-specific daily news programming such as Alaska News Nightly. The
award-winning statewide program has been broadcast for over four
decades.</p>
<p>The stations also relay national and international news through NPR
and the BBC. But many of the 733,400 Alaska residents receive important
information in their regions from local stations, information such as
emergency messages related to fires, earthquakes or other disasters as
part of emergency messaging system for the state.</p>
<p>Most of Alaska’s communities are not on the road system and public
radio is a lifeline, said Townsend.</p>
<p>“The public radio system in Alaska has been a more than four-decade
model of collaboration and providing critical news, information and
public safety service to Alaskan communities,” she added.</p>
<p>Federal investment in rural communities is critical for the 99% of
the U.S. population who have access to public broadcastings, said
Brendan Daly, of CPB. The nonprofit oversees federal investment in
public broadcasting.</p>
<p>Rural and Indigenous communities depend on the state’s public media
for news and public affairs, said Daly. “This is especially true in
Alaska, which is such a large and rural state.”</p>
<p>The two-year grant will be used to fund reporters and editors, travel
and equipment.</p>
<p>“The editors and reporters will mostly likely be a mix of new hires
and existing Alaska journalists, currently working in the APM network
and other newsrooms in Alaska,” said Townsend.</p>
<p>Stations will apply to host the new hires, Townsend said. The idea is
to put the staff in stations across the state to make it easier to
collaborate.</p>
<p>“We are in an exciting time of increased recognition of the
importance of journalism in supporting and strengthening the bedrock of
democracy,” said Townsend.</p>
<p>She added that the Alaska desk will work closely with communities on
local priorities and on “elevating voices that are seldom heard.”</p>
<p>The plan is to produce stories that “resonate with not only Alaskans,
but the rest of the nation and world, as geopolitical conflicts and
world resource needs draw more attention to the Arctic,” she said.</p>

id="australia-plans-to-build-secret-data-centers-with-amazon">Australia
plans to build secret data centers with Amazon</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SYDNEY — Australia said Thursday a $1.35 billion deal with U.S.
technology giant Amazon to build three secure data centers for
top-secret information will increase its military’s “war-fighting
capacity.”</p>
<p>The data centers are to be built in secret locations in Australia and
be run by an Australian subsidiary of the U.S. technology company Amazon
Web Service, the government said.</p>
<p>The deal is part of Australia’s National Defense Strategy, outlining
its commitment to Indo-Pacific security and maintaining “the global
rules-based order.” The country has a long-standing military alliance
with the United States and is a member, with the United Kingdom, U.S.,
Canada and New Zealand, of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance.</p>
<p>Australian officials said the project would create a
“state-of-the-art collaborative space” for intelligence and defense
agencies to store and gain access to sensitive information in a
centralized network.</p>
<p>Andrew Shearer, director-general of Australia’s Office of National
Intelligence, said in a statement that the project would allow “greater
interoperability with our most important international intelligence
partners.”</p>
<p>Similar data clouds have been set up in the United States and
Britain, allowing the sharing of information among agencies and
departments.</p>
<p>Richard Marles, Australia’s deputy prime minister and defense
minister, told reporters that highly sensitive national security data
will be safely secured in the new system.</p>
<p>“If you consider that any sensor which is on a defense platform,
which in turn feeds that data to a high tech capability, such as the
Joint Strike Fighter, which will use that to engage in targeting or
perhaps to defend itself from an in-coming threat, or … to defend
another asset, such as a ship — all of that is top secret data,” Marles
said.</p>
<p>The government said the Amazon Web Services storage system will use
artificial intelligence to detect suspected intrusions and to retrieve
data.</p>
<p>Richard Buckland, a professor in CyberCrime, Cyberwar and Cyberterror
at the University of New South Wales, told the Australian Broadcasting
Corporation that the storage plan has risks.</p>
<p>“Putting more data together in a central spot and sharing it widely
as people intend to do obviously increases the risk of a data breach,”
he said.</p>
<p>In a statement, Amazon Web Services’ managing director in Australia,
Iain Rouse, said the system would “enable the seamless sharing of
classified data between Australia’s National Intelligence Community and
the Australian Defense Force.”</p>
<p>The so-called top-secret cloud is scheduled to be in operation by
2027.</p>

<p>date: 2024-07-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>I’ve been working on a bunch of small projects involving
microcontrollers. Currently a lot of them are based around the Raspberry
Pi Pico boards because I like the development experience of those a lot.
They have a decent SDK and cheap hardware to get started and the
debugger works with gdb/openocd so it just integrates in all IDEs that
support that. One of my current projects is making a fancy hardware
controller for a bunch of video equipment I use. The main things that
will be controlled are two PTZ cameras (those are cameras that have
motors to move them). One stationary camera and the video switching
equipment that that’s hooked up to. ↫ Martijn Braam There’s more to
building something like this than connecting up hardware components –
there’s also software that needs to be taken care of. In this case, the
author is weighing several real-time operating systems for use in the
project, namely FreeRTOS, NuttX, and Zephyr. If you’re working on a
similar project, this article may help in choosing the RTOS that’s right
for you.</p>

<p>
While the Labour Party saw a historic win in Thursday’s general election
in the U.K., the new prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer, is without a raft
of money to implement sweeping reforms. So how will the new government
differ economically from the one seen under Conservative rule? And
later, it’s hard to prepare a meal with a newborn in your hands. That
inspired one couple to open a restaurant in Atlanta.

<p class="drop-caps">
Minneapolis may be the only city in the country with a carbon
sequestration program manager on staff. Now, Jim Doten — who holds that
title — is about to realize his dream of starting up one of the first
municipally owned and operated carbon removal projects.
</p>
<p>
The Minnesota metropolis has just purchased its very own biomass
pyrolyzer, a machine that heats up tree clippings in a low-oxygen
environment and turns them into a form of charcoal called
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/biochar-carbon-removal-microsoft" target="_self"><u>biochar</u></a>.
As the wood grew, it sucked carbon out of the air during photosynthesis;
as biochar, that carbon becomes stable for hundreds of years, if not
longer.
</p>
<p>
Biochar can be mixed into soil, and has a wide range of demonstrated
benefits, including increasing crop yields and enhancing the soil’s
capacity to hold water. Some studies suggest it can filter contaminants
out of stormwater. The city plans to use the biochar in public works
projects and donate it to community groups in “green zones,”
neighborhoods with high levels of pollution and marginalized
populations. It’s also in talks with other local governments that might
be interested in buying some.
</p>
<p>
“One of the things we want to do is be a regional resource for other
government agencies,” Doten told me, “whether it be city, county, state
agencies, making biochar available for projects addressing the effects
of climate change, sequestering carbon, as well as providing
environmental benefits throughout our infrastructure.”
</p>
<p>
Studies say that we should be shoveling billions of tons of CO2 out of
the skies each year by 2050 to keep climate change in check — and that’s
on top of cutting emissions to near-zero. Scholars have compared the
vast responsibility of cleaning up the carbon in the atmosphere to
municipal waste management: Since the task is more of a public good than
a profitable enterprise, it may be best suited for the folks we already
rely on to take out the trash.
</p>
<p>
A number of other municipalities have been experimenting with carbon
removal to support their climate goals. Notably, Boulder County,
Colorado teamed up with Flagstaff, Arizona, and a number of other
cities, to form the
<a href="https://grist.org/climate/why-boulder-and-flagstaff-are-pooling-resources-to-purchase-carbon-removal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Four
Corners Coalition</u></a>, which is pooling resources to finance local
carbon removal projects. But Minneapolis is the first, at least that I’m
aware of, to essentially start its own carbon removal department.
</p>
<p>
Doten became a biochar evangelist more than a decade ago. He first
learned of the substance’s various benefits while working in southern
Afghanistan with the Minnesota National Guard in 2012. He was serving as
a hydrologist on an agribusiness development team and helping village
farmers rebuild soil health to improve crop yields. When he returned to
Minneapolis the following year, he was eager to test out biochar’s
benefits at home.
</p>
<p>
Over the decade that followed, Doten worked days as the supervisor of
environmental services for the city’s health department. But on the
side, he led a number of biochar passion project. He convinced the
public works department to use biochar in landscaping projects along
street medians. He started a partnership with the Shakopee Mdewakanton
Sioux, a tribe that runs a compost facility, to provide a mix of compost
and biochar to urban gardens around the city. He got the health
department to sponsor a research trial at the community farm at
<a href="https://www.littleearth.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Little
Earth</u></a>, a federally-subsidized housing complex primarily occupied
by indigenous families. Though the study was disrupted by vandalism, the
city gathered enough data to show that the plots with biochar-amended
compost saw superior plant health, food production and water retention
during August drought conditions.
</p>
<p>
Doten told me the limiting factor for expanding these programs was the
availability of biochar. The city was buying it and shipping it in from
elsewhere, which Doten was also not happy about because the emissions
from shipping cuts into any climate benefits. Then, in 2019, he had the
opportunity to see what the city could do if finding biochar wasn’t an
issue. Bloomberg Philanthropies flew Doten and his colleagues to
Stockholm, Sweden, where five years earlier, the charity had helped the
city finance its own biochar production facility.
</p>
<p>
“So I went to Stockholm along with one of our city council members and
the head of public works, and ’I’ll be darned, oh my gosh, Jim, you
weren’t lying, this is a real program and it does really great things in
Stockholm!” Doten recalled. He waxed on about the “Stockholm method” for
planting urban trees that involves using biochar and which can help
manage the flow of stormwater. Stockholm is also sending waste heat from
its pyrolysis facility into a district heating system used to warm
apartments.
</p>
<p>
A few years later, Bloomberg Philanthropies invited other cities to
apply for funding to build similar programs. Minneapolis was
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.org/press/bloomberg-philanthropies-announces-mayors-challenge-winning-project-to-combat-climate-change-will-spread-to-seven-global-cities/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>one
of three U.S. cities</u></a>, along with Lincoln, Nebraska, and
Cincinnati, Ohio, to win $400,000 in 2022 to develop city-wide biochar
projects. All three are expected to begin construction on their
production facilities this year; Doten hopes the Minneapolis facility
will be operational this fall.
</p>
<p>
The city has made an agreement with Xcel Energy, the local utility, to
collect the tree clippings from the company’s electrical line
maintenance work — previously that material was getting burned in a
power plant. Doten has also found a site for the facility — a somewhat
isolated industrial property near railroad tracks — which was no easy
feat in an urban environment. “It’s very difficult to site a place like
this within the city that’s not near residences, properly zoned, get the
neighborhood approvals, council approvals, and make sure everybody’s
happy — well I shouldn’t say happy, but at least satisfied with the
result.”
</p>
<p>
The other big piece was sourcing the equipment. As my colleague Katie
Brigham has
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/biochar-carbon-removal-microsoft" target="_self"><u>reported</u></a>,
there are <em><em>a lot</em></em> of biochar companies. According to
<a href="https://alliedoffsets.com/cdr-data/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>one
carbon removal database</u></a>, there are more than 240 such companies
around the world — more than any other type of carbon removal company.
But most of them have developed fancy pyrolysis machines for their own
use, to develop their own carbon removal projects. There aren’t that
many offering the technology for sale. Doten said he talked to most of
the ones that did, and there was one company whose bid came in far below
the rest — BluSky, a small startup based in Connecticut. Minneapolis
purchased the company’s equipment, nicknamed the “Vulcan” system, for
$585,000.
</p>
<p>
“We really believe in what Jim is doing and what the city is doing,”
Will Hessert, the company’s CEO, told me. “We want to see more cities
doing this.”
</p>
<p>
Writing in <em><em>The New Republic</em></em> in 2022, four scholars
made a case for a public model for carbon removal. They argued that if
the responsibility is left to private companies, it could end up like
plastic recycling, which is
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/03/31/822597631/plastic-wars-three-takeaways-from-the-fight-over-the-future-of-plastics" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>basically
a big lie</u></a> and “distracts from underlying causes while pollution
continues.” Or it could end up like privately owned electric utilities
who take shortcuts that end up costing lives, like how PG&amp;E’s
inadequate maintenance led to the 2018 Camp Fire in California.
</p>
<p>
“Imagine a regional, community-run carbon removal authority,” they
wrote, “that simultaneously pursues wetland restoration and forest
management, safely operates an industrial removal facility and
associated mining and geological sequestration operations, monitors
carbon levels in forests, and works with farmers to maintain healthy
fields that store carbon in the soil.”
</p>
<p>
That’s not what’s happening in Minneapolis. The climate benefits are
likely to be minimal. The city couldn’t provide me with an estimate, but
a
<a href="https://www.minneapolismn.gov/news/2023/november/biochar/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>story
about the project</u></a> from last year noted that the city anticipated
having a system that could handle 3,600 tons of wood waste per year,
resulting in an estimated 1,500 tons of CO2 removed. That’s about 0.04%
of the city’s current annual emissions.
</p>
<p>
There is a real opportunity for cities to play a role in carbon removal.
A
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44284-024-00069-x" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>study</u></a>
from 2022 found that cities might be able to play a significant role in
carbon removal — potentially removing up to 1 billion tons per year,
though the numbers are “plagued by uncertainties” — by sequestering
carbon in vegetation, soils, and the built environment. In that sense,
Minneapolis’ biochar program could be one component of this larger
vision.

<h2>
Let’s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?
</h2>
<p>
I’m originally from Ukraine, I grew up there and finished university.
Moved out in 2010 to explore the world. Since 2014 US was my home base.
</p>
<p>
I’m software engineer by trade. It was my education and first I worked
as a programmer because it was my career choice. But sometime around
2011 I fell in love with the web and programming. I worked at several
startups and few bigger tech companies and also created countless side
projects.
</p>
<h2>
What’s the story behind your blog?
</h2>
<p>
I created my personal site around 2013. It is 10+ years old. I think I
created it during the period when I was falling in love with programming
and ideas behind web and the Internet. I got exposed to them way later
in my life than people who grew up in Western Europe or US. I had a lot
of personal revelations at that time in my life.
</p>
<h2>
What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?
</h2>
<p>
Super simple. I discovered that writing feels “painful” for me. I really
do struggle. The only way that works for me is to remove editing part
and also write in the “stream of consciousness style”. I write stuff in
one go. I write some essay in Apple Notes and it gets published
automatically to my site while I’m writing it. I might reread it some
time later and edit few things - but usually I don’t do that and just
discover some typos years later.
</p>
<p>
Another important thing is that I mostly write on topics I don’t want to
think anymore. Writing is the final step of thinking over something for
me. I write down about some topic, publish it and then don’t think about
that again for a while.
</p>
<h2>
Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the
physical space influences your creativity?
</h2>
<p>
I wrote decent amount of essays on airplanes and trains. They are
uncomfortable physically, but I found them to be a great time to write
and to speed up the travel, Internet is flaky and I have space to
reflect. I also like to write(and program) in coffeeshops. I like noise
and I can usually fully block it out.
</p>
<h2>
A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech
stack?
</h2>
<p>
I’m software engineer. I always made custom stacks for my personal site.
For the past 2 years my website is powered by a small tool I made. It’s
a tool that publishes Apple Notes to my site. It’s called Montaigne.
</p>
<h2>
Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do
anything differently?
</h2>
<p>
I want to say: start even earlier. But that is also difficult because I
do feel that I didn’t have much to say before I was 25 yo and also I
didn’t discover my “voice”. But I think trying writing helps to discover
that voice.
</p>
<p>
Write as often as you can. If it’s 5 essays per year - it’s still good.
I collected many over the years and sometimes I open some and read and
get surprised with some insights I got. It’s a very interesting feeling.
</p>
<p>
I feel like even now I don’t capture most of the insights I have during
the year. So writing more is always a good advice.
</p>
<h2>
Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does
it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some
revenue? And what’s your position on people monetising personal blogs?
</h2>
<p>
I think people should do what they feel is good for them. If you are in
the position where you want/need to monetize - do that. If money is not
critical, do not do it. Eg write for yourself first. On top of that
there might be some second order unpredictable benefits to writing. Eg
someone would reach out to you and would offer a job or collaboration.
This is way better than money(if you don’t need them).
</p>
<p>
Hard to say how much does it cost to run my site since it runs using the
tool that I made. But for other people this tool is free:)
</p>
<h2>
