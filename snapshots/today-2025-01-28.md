## Reviews of New Food: Jeni’s Cosmic Bloom Ice Cream

date: 2025-01-28, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p>Have you ever time-traveled? I didn’t think I had until that day in the freezer aisle at Horizon Market, staring at an ice cream flavor that seemed like a practical joke: Jeni’s Cosmic Bloom. It sounded like an overpriced candle. The carton teased: “Citric like a mandarin, refreshing like a kiwi, punchy like passion fruit.” That told me absolutely nothing. But the color—a dreamy pastel orange—made my inner child hope, <i>could it be?</i></p> <p>I dropped my usual raspberry sorbet and gambled on this pastel-orange mystery. Back home, I tore off the lid, scooped up a perfectly creamy ball, and popped it in my mouth.</p> <p>Indistinguishable citrus. It had that same syrupy, borderline-fluorescent smell I hadn’t experienced since the early 2000s, a tangy, wildly unnatural orange, radioactive creamsicle. Cosmic Bloom was not trying to pretend it was made of real fruit—something the future ruined with its obsession over real ingredients. It was something else, something familiar.</p> <p>The second I had a second bite, my kitchen vanished.</p> <p>Gone. </p> <p>I looked around, bewildered. A kid zoomed past me on a neon-green bike with handlebar streamers. Another was arguing about the rules of tetherball. And in the distance, the faint sound of the <i>X-Files</i> theme hummed from a boxy TV inside someone’s house. A boom box blasted <i>Wannabe</i> by the Spice Girls. I looked down at my frozen treat, a small cylinder of ice cream encased in a colorful cardboard tube, a plastic stick protruding from the bottom, pale orange droplets spreading down my hand. The flavor I knew to be extinct in 2024. That must mean…</p> <p>I was standing barefoot on a crumbling suburban driveway, wearing stonewashed jeans and a Ren &amp; Stimpy T-shirt, and clutching—of all things—a Flintstones Push-Up Pop.</p> <p>I was in the 1990s.</p> <p>What would I do first? Would I binge on Dunkaroos, waste hours playing Super Mario Kart, and kill off my Tamagotchi? The world smelled faintly of Nickelodeon slime and pizza bagels.</p> <p>I took a bite, shoving the entire popsicle into my mouth, and—BAM.</p> <p>I was back in my kitchen, holding a spoon and staring at the empty countertop where the Cosmic Bloom carton had been. All that was left was its orange carton. My iPhone pinged with a loud Slack message, <i>Real Housewives of Salt Lake City </i>screeched, and three bottles of oat milk warmed on my white marble counter.</p> <p>It was 2024, again. I rushed to Horizon Mart, desperate to return to the nineties. I scoured the freezer aisle. No Cosmic Bloom.</p> <p>I returned to the store again and again. Waiting for it to reappear. While Flintstones Push-Up Pops had vanished from the modern world long ago, Cosmic Bloom had brought it back, but only for a moment. The taste of nostalgia, where flavors were colors and everything had a touch of synthetic Red.</p> <p>Now, every time I pass the freezer aisle, I search for Cosmic Bloom with the same quiet hope I once reserved for Flintstones Push-Up Pops—an elusive treasure I stopped chasing long ago. Each time I peel back the frosted glass, I hold my breath, wishing—just for a fleeting moment—to discover something else that can whisk me back to the past.</p>

## Book: The Problem with Change

date: 2025-01-28, from: Accidentally in Code

I think the thing I enjoyed most about Ashley Goodall’s The Problem with Change is the author’s cynicism about corporate America. In places it’s a little bit of a diatribe, but what can I say, I love it. I love it all the more that it comes from someone who successfully navigated the Byzantine ladder [&#8230;]

## Everything You Need to Know about Rememory, the $150 Million Apple TV Hit That Can Be Watched Only in a Retirement Community in Ohio

date: 2025-01-28, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p>Following in the footsteps of Apple TV’s star-studded non-<i>Severance</i> critically acclaimed shows that no one has ever heard of because they never advertise them, like <i>Disclaimer</i>, <i>Presumed Innocent</i>, and <i>For All Mankind</i>, <i>Rememory</i> has been described by Apple’s Tim Cook as “our greatest achievement yet.” With the second season likely to pick up a whole host of Emmys to add to the streamer’s growing collection, here’s everything you need to know about television’s newest era-defining show.</p> <p><i>Rememory</i> is set in the early 2010s, centering on a seemingly normal group of suburban Americans who wake up one day to find themselves haunted by memories of lives that don’t seem to be theirs. With their every waking moment occupied by fragments of someone or something not from their consciousness, the so-called &#8220;re-rememberers&#8221; try to ground themselves in their strange new reality.</p> <p>Carried by incredible performances from Brian Tyree Henry, Steven Yeun, Hunter Schafer, Mark Ruffalo, Ayo Edebiri, and Tom Hanks, the show oozes stardom. Most importantly, in a boundary-pushing decision taken by Apple TV’s marketing team, the series can be viewed only if you are a current resident of Golden Acres Senior Living Community, an elder-care complex located in scenic Rocky River, Ohio.</p> <p>Apple TV spared no expense in bringing the complex emotions and multi-layered timelines of <i>Rememory</i> to the small screen, with season 2 rumored to have a budget of $150 million. Much of that was spent on creating an immersive reality never before seen on a television show, with every part of <i>Rememory</i>’s suburban setting being recreated on a soundstage in LA.</p> <p>In addition to John’s (Yeun) condo, in which he grieves the life whose sad re-remembrances he now experiences, and Marie’s (Schafer) workplace, a nondescript and soul-crushing call center, the production team custom-built a fully functional replica of a Target that appears for only twenty seconds in the second episode of season 2. As a result, the Apple TV marketing team was left with a fifty-dollar budget, which they spent on ensuring that the residents of Golden Acres could pool together for one Apple TV login that allowed them to watch the show. While no one else in America has seen <i>Rememory</i>, the Golden Acres residents were entranced by the show, especially once they realized they couldn’t figure out how to turn the TV back to the Browns game they were trying to watch.</p> <p>With a previously unheard-of level of detail and budget flowing into the show, Apple TV decided not to advertise for the program. Relying on word of mouth, the streaming service pursued a viral marketing strategy consisting of a QR code that Golden Acres residents did not know how to access or share. As a result, the show had an average viewership of fourteen people per episode, one more than the number of Emmy nominations season 2 received.</p> <p>Despite that, Apple TV is determined to make sure its new hit is put in front of as many eyes as possible. Starting this upcoming season, people interested in watching the show can check themselves into Golden Acres for luxurious end-of-life care and the chance to see Nicole Kidman’s cameo in episode 5.</p>

<p>Again, just to emphasize this point, all of the decisions DeepSeek made in the design of this model only make sense if you are constrained to the H800; if DeepSeek had access to H100s, they probably would have used a larger training cluster with much fewer optimizations specifically focused on overcoming the lack of bandwidth.</p></blockquote>

## Executive Order: We Must Stop Everyone from Transitioning, So the President Knows Who to Grope

date: 2025-01-28, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p><i>&#8220;An executive order President Donald Trump signed on his first day back in office offers a new federal government definition of the sexes that could have a major impact on transgender people nationwide. The order calls for the federal government to define sex as only male or female and for that to be reflected on official documents such as passports and policies such as federal prison assignments.&#8221; &#8212; <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-transgender-passports-prisons-eggs-sperm-da1d1d280658a8c85c57cfec2f30cefb">AP</a></i></p> <div class='break'>- - -</div><p><span class="dropcap">B</span>y the authority vested in me as President by whatever shreds of the Constitution I feel like keeping today, it is hereby ordered:</p> <p><strong>Section 1. Purpose.</strong> <br /> Folks, we have to get a handle on the genders. There’s a lot of trans-ing going on, in multiple directions. They’re trans-ing all over the place. California’s on fire. Eggs are too goddamned expensive, and dogs and cats are making out in the streets. Somewhere, a thirty-four-year-old comedy writer is wearing a compression top and sipping a green tea. It’s anarchy. And it’s hurting the women, which is something that I definitely care about. Women should have at least three rights, I think.</p> <p>We need women, probably. We also need sex. They’ve taken out all the sex and replaced it with gender, which is a big problem because it makes it very boring. No more.</p> <p><strong>Section 2. Policy and Definitions.</strong> <br /> It is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes: “groper” and “grope-ee.” These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality. Maintaining this clear distinction between the sexes is critical to prurient inquiry, “public safety,” my personal morale, and trust in the infallibility of my urges.</p> <p style="padding-left:2em;">a. Men who have rejected their biological realities as “gropers” will heretofore be reclassified as “cucks.” Women not deemed to be “gropable” shall be known as “dogs.”</p> <p style="padding-left:2em;">b. For science purposes, “women” are likewise defined as large reproductive cells encased in sexy hourglass meat globs.</p> <p><strong>Section 3. Recognizing That Women Are Biologically Distinct from Men.</strong> <br /> Within thirty days, the trans-ing back and forth has got to stop, folks.</p> <p style="padding-left:2em;">a. “Women” are “women” because I want to grope them. “Men” are “men” because I do not. If we start crossing those lines, then I have to think about things I don’t want to think about, like the word “fluid” and how innate biological differences shouldn’t need aggressive legislative reinforcement.</p> <p style="padding-left:2em;">b. We especially have to stop this for the kids. It’s just too upsetting and confusing. For me. We need to protect our girls. These young girls, they’re the gropable future. And sometimes the present, if they’re at least solid eights&#8212;which shall forthwith be defined as “asking for it.”</p> <p style="padding-left:2em;">c. To clarify (a), “men” are “men,” and “women” are “women,” but “girls,” or “juvenile human females,” are also “women,” when it’s convenient for me.</p> <p><strong>Section 4. On the Protection and Control of Women and Children.</strong></p> <p style="padding-left:2em;">a. When kids get trans-ed, they’re sexualized inappropriately instead of appropriately, which is to say, when they marry us as soon as they’re legal and can bear our blond offspring.</p> <p style="padding-left:2em;">b. No man shall invade intimate single-sex spaces and activities designed for women, like <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jtes/a-fifth-teen-beauty-queen-says-trump-visited-dressing-room#.puz1qYYKy">dressing rooms</a>, unless he owns the pageant and he’s inspecting to make sure there are no men in there, and he’s already “seen it all before.”</p> <p style="padding-left:2em;">c. Nonbinaries are nonsensical and will not be recognized for efficiency. If I have unsupervised access to a fifteen-year-old in an evening gown, I don’t want to waste time trying to figure out what kind of “Dylan” they are.</p> <p style="padding-left:2em;">d. We condemn trans surgeries for minors, which <a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/gender-affirming-surgeries-rarely-performed-on-transgender-youth/">I like to say is a thing</a>. We need to know that Madison’s new B-cups are naturals. To be clear, we’re still in favor of implants. But they have to go on top of naturals. Or else that would be unnatural.</p> <p><strong>Section 5. On the Protection of the President and His Capacities.</strong></p> <p style="padding-left:2em;">a. We must preserve the sanctity of the American family and my future <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/jeffrey-epstein-introduced-trump-14-ghislaine-maxwell-accuser-says-rcna7253">dating pool</a>, since Melania’s getting a little long in the tooth.</p> <p style="padding-left:2em;">b. But it’s not about age. Not at all. It’s about consent, people. <a href="https://19thnews.org/2023/10/donald-trump-associates-sexual-misconduct-allegations/">I love consent</a>. I’d kiss consent on the mouth. Trans-ing is a slippery slope. If there’s an incredible-looking girl at a party — even if she was a little up there, like, say <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/turning-35-donald-trump-comments">thirty-five</a> — I’d rather that girl be in a pine box (<a href="https://www.hrc.org/resources/fatal-violence-against-the-transgender-and-gender-expansive-community-in-2023">many such cases</a>) than touch her without asking and then learn that she once did Pinewood Derby as a Cub Scout. That would be a violation of my consent, very bad.</p> <p style="padding-left:2em;">c. All federal agencies must subordinate their current functions to indulge the President’s need to live out the first fifteen minutes of <i>Wag the Dog</i>. This is what your tax dollars are going to.</p> <p style="padding-left:2em;">d. By eliminating trans-ing, we will eliminate transphobia. Transphobia is a terrible, terrible thing. It’s too complicated. We must return to being a proper country where “misogyny” is “misogyny” and “homophobia” is “homophobia,” so you can keep your sexual assault and your gay panic separate.</p> <p><strong>Section 6. On Documentation and Language.</strong></p> <p style="padding-left:2em;">a. All citizens must have their correct sex on their identification. When it comes to the transed, you see, we can always tell, so we need extensive documentation that tells us what we already know.</p> <p style="padding-left:2em;">b. The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security will <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/24/politics/state-department-suspends-passports-x-gender-marker/index.html">suspend the processing of any passport with a gender change marker</a>. We don’t want the trans here, but I’ll be damned if I let them leave.</p> <p style="padding-left:2em;">b. To enforce the mutably immutable truth of binary sex, I hereby eliminate all use of the prefix “trans.” The White House doesn’t stand for divisive concepts like “transgender,” “translation,” “transcultural,” “transformation,” “transcendence,” or “transparency.” “Transgression” and “transaction” can stay, but only for the President and his cabinet.</p> <p>You’re all safer now, and you’re welcome. Some things aren’t meant to change. I know I sure won’t.</p> <p>&#8212; <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">WHITE</span> <span class="caps">HOUSE</span></p>

## DeepSeek Janus-Pro

date: 2025-01-27, updated: 2025-01-27, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/Janus?tab=readme-ov-file">DeepSeek Janus-Pro</a></strong></p>
Another impressive model release from DeepSeek. Janus is their series of "unified multimodal understanding and generation models" - these are models that can both accept images as input <em>and</em> generate images for output.</p>
<p>Janus-Pro is the new 7B model, which DeepSeek describe as "an advanced version of Janus, improving both multimodal understanding and visual generation significantly". It's released under the not fully open source <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-LLM/blob/HEAD/LICENSE-MODEL">DeepSeek license</a>.</p>
<p>Janus-Pro is accompanied by <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/Janus/blob/main/janus_pro_tech_report.pdf">this paper</a>, which includes this note about the training:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our Janus is trained and evaluated using <a href="https://www.high-flyer.cn/en/blog/hai-llm/">HAI-LLM</a>, which is a lightweight and efficient distributed training framework built on top of PyTorch. The whole training process took about 7/14 days on a cluster of 16/32 nodes for 1.5B/7B model, each equipped with 8 Nvidia A100 (40GB) GPUs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It includes a lot of high benchmark scores, but closes with some notes on the model's current limitations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In terms of multimodal understanding, the input resolution is limited
to 384 × 384, which affects its performance in fine-grained tasks such as OCR. For text-to-image generation, the low resolution, combined with reconstruction losses introduced by the vision tokenizer, results in images that, while rich in semantic content, still lack fine details. For example, small facial regions occupying limited image space may appear under-detailed. Increasing the image resolution could mitigate these issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The easiest way to try this one out is using the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/deepseek-ai/Janus-Pro-7B">Hugging Face Spaces demo</a>. I tried the following prompt for the image generation capability:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>A photo of a raccoon holding a handwritten sign that says "I love trash"</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And got back this image:</p>
<p><img alt="I cute raccoon is holding a sign which says the word I, then a red heart, then a garbled word like tratieh, then a less garbled wrd trash" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/janus-i-love-trash.jpg" /></p>
<p>It's now also been ported to <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/en/index">Transformers.js</a>, which means you can run the 1B model directly in a WebGPU browser such as Chrome <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/webml-community/janus-pro-webgpu">here at webml-community/janus-pro-webgpu</a> (loads about 2.24 GB of model files).

## Qwen2.5 VL! Qwen2.5 VL! Qwen2.5 VL!

date: 2025-01-27, updated: 2025-01-27, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-vl/">Qwen2.5 VL! Qwen2.5 VL! Qwen2.5 VL!</a></strong></p>
Hot on the heels of yesterday's <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/26/qwen25-1m/">Qwen2.5-1M</a>, here's Qwen2.5 VL (with an excitable announcement title) - the latest in Qwen's series of vision LLMs.</p>
<p>They're <a href="https://huggingface.co/collections/Qwen/qwen25-vl-6795ffac22b334a837c0f9a5">releasing multiple versions</a>: base models and instruction tuned models at 3B, 7B and 72B. There's a lot of additional information <a href="https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-VL/blob/main/README.md">in their README</a>.</p>
<p>The 72B model can be selected on Qwen's <a href="https://chat.qwenlm.ai/">Qwen Chat</a> interface. I gave it this image of our dog Cleo joy rolling on the beach:</p>
<p><img alt="Cleo having a joyful roll on the beach" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/cleo-sand.jpg" /></p>
<p>And prompted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Describe this image in detail, be flowery</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Since the Qwen team tends to use <a href="https://simonwillison.net/search/?q=flowery&amp;tag=qwen">flowery language</a> in their announcements.)</p>
<p>Here's what I got back:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this enchanting tableau, a canine companion finds solace in the embrace of nature's softest bed. The sandy expanse stretches out like an endless canvas, its surface etched with the delicate imprints of countless wanderers who have come and gone, leaving behind a tapestry of footprints that whisper tales of joyous romps and serene strolls.</p>
<p>The dog, a vision of contentment, lies sprawled upon the sand, its dark fur gleaming under the gentle caress of the sun. Its body is relaxed, limbs splayed in abandon, as if it has surrendered to the soothing rhythm of the beach. A vibrant red collar adorns its neck, a splash of color against the muted tones of the surroundings, hinting at the care and love bestowed upon this cherished pet.</p>
<p>The sand itself is a work of art, its grains shimmering with a silvery sheen that catches the light. Here and there, small tufts of seaweed peek through, remnants of the ocean's bounty, adding a touch of wild beauty to the scene. The shadows cast by unseen objects dance across the sand, creating a play of light and dark that lends an air of mystery to the tranquil setting.</p>
<p>This moment, frozen in time, speaks of peace and harmony, where man's best friend finds respite in the simple pleasures of life. It is a scene that invites one to pause, breathe deeply, and revel in the serenity of nature's embrace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm looking forward to trying out their smaller models - the 3B model in particular should be small enough to run comfortably even on an iPhone, so hopefully someone will wire up an example of that soon (maybe using MLX).</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/reach_vb/status/1883959714796675206">VB points out</a> that the vision benchmarks for Qwen 2.5 VL 7B show it out-performing GPT-4o mini!</p>
<p><img alt="Qwen 2.5-VL 7B scores highest on MMMU Pro, DocVQA, InfoVQA, CC-OCR, OCRBenchV2, MMStar, MMBench1.1, MathVista, MathVision, VideoMME, LVBench, and AITZ. GPT-4o Mini scores best on MMMU, MegaBench. Other models of a similar size score better on CharadesSTA, Android Control, ScreenSpot, and ScreenSpot Pro." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/qwen-25-vl-benchmarks.jpg" /></p>

## Steam Brick Mod converts a Steam Deck handheld into a tiny portable gaming desktop

## ggml : x2 speed for WASM by optimizing SIMD

date: 2025-01-27, updated: 2025-01-27, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/11453">ggml : x2 speed for WASM by optimizing SIMD</a></strong></p>
PR by Xuan-Son Nguyen for <code>llama.cpp</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This PR provides a big jump in speed for WASM by leveraging SIMD instructions for <code>qX_K_q8_K</code> and <code>qX_0_q8_0</code> dot product functions.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, 99% of the code in this PR is <strong>written by DeekSeek-R1</strong>. The only thing I do is to develop tests and write prompts (with some trails and errors)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They shared <a href="https://gist.github.com/ngxson/307140d24d80748bd683b396ba13be07">their prompts</a> here, which they ran directly through R1 on <a href="https://chat.deepseek.com/">chat.deepseek.com</a> - it spent 3-5 minutes "thinking" about each prompt.</p>
<p>I've been seeing some very promising results from DeepSeek R1 for code as well. Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/5a3ac1454328ca335fee796e57e26b09">a recent transcript</a> where I used it to rewrite the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-groq/blob/c001f3b261f99dfd663d3c8083d11d71c1f870f1/llm_groq.py">llm_groq.py</a> plugin to imitate the cached model JSON pattern used by <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mistral/blob/30fb4fb9f25fe421267560e8216f72d235a1dc89/llm_mistral.py">llm_mistral.py</a>, resulting in <a href="https://github.com/angerman/llm-groq/pull/19">this PR</a>.</p>
<p>I tried the <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/c9024b7feffda865ef10138dacfddcdc">same thing against o1</a>, but I think DeepSeek R1 did it better. In particular, from the R1 chain of thought:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wait, but in the model_map, "groq-gemma" maps to "gemma-7b-it". So, perhaps the model_map is needed to map the local model IDs to the actual Groq model names.</p>
<p>But since the model_map is hardcoded, and the API returns available models, perhaps the model_map should be built dynamically from the API response.</p>
<p>Alternatively, perhaps the model_map can be eliminated, and the models are registered based on the fetched models.</p>
<p>Wait, perhaps the model_map is no longer necessary. Instead, when the models are fetched from the API, each model's "id" is the actual model name used in the Groq API. So, when registering the models, the local model ID is "groq-{id}", and the groq_model_id is "id".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(It thought about <code>model_map</code> a <em>lot</em> before finally deciding to eliminate it, which was also my preferred resolution.)

## Watch as I Destroy Your Society, Gradually, Over the Course of One Hundred to Two Hundred Years

date: 2025-01-27, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p>Now that I have defeated you, I shall feed my conceit and explain the horrors I will enact upon you&#8230;</p> <p>Behold despair. Behold destruction. Behold the ultimate instrument of my revenge&#8212;a multifactorial framework of social, political, and economic pressures to undermine your country via the erosion of its complex systems!</p> <p>What? Why are you looking at me like that? What did you expect? I can tell from your face that you clearly wanted something different. Trust me when I say I wish it were something cooler too. For my sake and yours, just admit you’re disappointed.</p> <p>I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but, uh, most societal collapses aren’t really that dramatic. Everyone imagines like a hurricane made of tornadoes or AI cyborgs declaring war on humanity. Or worst yet, AI cyborgs taking white-collar jobs.</p> <p>I could spend all my time and money on some crazy technological feat. I did consider pouring a ton of baking soda and vinegar into the Yellowstone supervolcano, but luckily for you, I consider myself an <i>artiste</i>&#8212;and a realist. We’re talking about the dismantling of the social contract, the collapse of human networks, and the end of life as you know it!</p> <p>If I wanted to chase delusions of grandeur, I would have become a politician, not a supervillain.</p> <p>Nuclear hellfire? Yawn, so gauche. What is this? 1982? Oops, I dropped my nostalgia for neon and Stephen King–inspired tales of youthful adventure and lost innocence. How about instead of wasting my time, you go read <i>Ready Player One</i>?</p> <p>You see, the combination of my PhD in early modern European history and more therapy sessions than I’m willing to admit led me to this, my greatest revelation. Looking in the mirror, I asked myself, <i>Who is my greatest enemy?</i></p> <p>Eureka! My greatest enemy is <i>me</i>. Your greatest enemy is <i>you</i>. Get it? Please, don’t take it like that. You’re still a close second on my nemesis list. I’m just trying to make a point.</p> <p>Sure, it may take ten years, a hundred years, or even a thousand years, but eventually, I will have my revenge. You will, at some indeterminate point in the abstract future, suffer a prolonged period of societal decay due to withering social institutions, economic contraction, and political instability brought about by elite infighting.</p> <p>You think you’re different? So optimistic. Nothing will impede my efforts, nothing except&#8230; no, I fear to even think of it&#8230; nothing except… <br /> maybe&#8230; just maybe&#8230; the aggregate efforts of prosocial forces over the centuries.</p> <p>HA!</p> <p>Good luck sustaining, let alone maintaining, institutional memory in the Internet Age. What’s that? Committed nurturing of the social fabric requires dedicated effort over a period of time longer than the average human lifespan?</p> <p>My rebuttal: Silly kitty wants a cheeseburger.</p> <p>And the best part of it all, the most devious implication of my plan, is that I don’t even have to lift a finger. It just kinda&#8230; uh&#8230; happens…</p> <p>Look, I don’t like admitting that, as an individual, I really have little say over how and when your society collapses. I mean, hell, it might not even be that bad. You don’t have to be treasured British classicist Mary Beard to know that the Dark Ages were really a tapestry of population movement and more of an evolution, rather than an implosion, of existing social norms. I mean, <i>duh</i>. Who’s to say the same won’t happen once my plan takes hold?</p> <p>You can stop me, you can imprison me, you can even kill me. But you can’t kill the abstract amalgamation of socioeconomic forces that compose history. And that leaves nothing to say about the warm, gooey narrative structure humanity likes to add on top.</p> <p>So, yes, yes, <span class="caps">YES</span>. Right on schedule&#8230;</p> <p>Only fifty short years until the first event in a long, long series of social perturbations. I need only kick back, relax, and watch as it partially unfolds during the rest of my long, long life.</p>

## A Chinese Spy’s Surveillance Report on American  TikTok Users

date: 2025-01-27, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<h2><span class="caps">SURVEILLANCE</span> <span class="caps">REPORT</span> #4891</h2> <p><span class="caps">SUBJECT</span>: American Social Media Behavioral Analysis <br /> <span class="caps">DATE</span>: 01/22/2025<br /> <span class="caps">AGENT</span>: Chen Wei</p> <p>I continue to monitor American social media trends on TikTok to identify opportunities for ideological influence and assess potential threats to collectivist ideals. Below are my findings on key creators of interest.</p> <h4>@corporatebestie</h4> <p>A twenty-eight-year-old marketing coordinator living in a major metropolitan area, simultaneously critiquing and participating in late-stage capitalism. Her content primarily revolves around “day in the life” videos and career advice.</p> <ul> <li>Her direct messages indicate that she is &#8220;girl bossing too close to the sun.&#8221;</li> <li>Recently posted a TikTok complaining about an eighteen-dollar acai bowl. Seems to have a basic grasp of commodity fetishism.</li> <li>Shows promising signs of class consciousness despite LinkedIn premium membership.</li> <li>Recommendation: She is one algorithmic nudge away from embracing socialism with Chinese characteristics.</li> </ul> <h4>@to.the.moon_</h4> <p>A twenty-one-year-old male living in Austin, Texas. Quit his job during the pandemic to trade cryptocurrency. Content is exclusively ill-advised crypto trading advice.</p> <ul> <li>Initially flagged as a capitalist threat.</li> <li>After losing life savings in cryptocurrency, has begun posting about &#8220;rigged system.&#8221;</li> <li>Recently learned the word &#8220;proletariat&#8221; (pronounces it incorrectly).</li> <li>Recommendation: Monitor for recruitment potential once savings are fully depleted.</li> </ul> <h4>@karen.miller79</h4> <p>A forty-two-year-old mother of one. Initial channel success derived from cute baby content. Currently experiencing a decline in engagement as her baby has aged into a toddler of average attractiveness. Experienced a resurgence in popularity due to her Stanley Tumbler videos.</p> <ul> <li><span class="caps">WITHDRAWAL</span> OF <span class="caps">PREVIOUS</span> <span class="caps">EXPENSE</span> <span class="caps">REQUEST</span>: After months of surveillance, I am officially declaring the Stanley cup trend <span class="caps">OVER</span>.</li> <li>I have spent $472 of state funds tracking this trend, which will not please my supervisor. These cups are <span class="caps">NOT</span> worth the bureaucratic explanation I must now provide.</li> <li>Interest has shifted to miniature “Trader Joe’s” tote bags. These bags seem to serve little to no utilitarian purpose. Perhaps an example of American excess? Submitted expense report (#28732) requesting exactly five (5) miniature tote bags for further study.</li> </ul> <h4>@gregleary</h4> <p>A twenty-six-year-old male fitness influencer. Current content strategy involves pivoting to what appears to be an attempt at sketch comedy.</p> <ul> <li>Believes personal transformation can overcome systemic barriers.</li> <li>Actually just selling protein powder and performative masculinity.</li> <li>His “meal prep for the week” videos appear to emulate central planning but are fundamentally flawed by individualist overtones</li> <li>Recommendation: Let him continue. He is harmless.</li> </ul> <h4>@kenny_boy</h4> <p>Kenny is a well-mannered Maltese dog. Continue promoting his content.</p> <h4>Special Intelligence Briefing: <br /> Justin Baldoni/Blake Lively <br /> Cultural Conflict</h4> <p>After extensive analysis of the recent social media conflict between Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively, we formally request an official party stance from the Ministry of Cultural Affairs. Ministerial guidance is urgently needed on this critical conflict.</p> <p><strong>Context:</strong> Blake Lively accused Justin Baldoni of inappropriate on-set behavior during the filming of <i>It Ends with Us</i>. Baldoni denied the allegations, releasing footage that has only further divided public opinion.</p> <p><strong>Agent&#8217;s Analysis:</strong> This situation has become a cultural flashpoint, making it difficult to discern whether to critique Baldoni’s performative activism or focus on Lively’s contradictions as a critique of capitalist moral posturing. Immediate guidance is required to determine whether either narrative can be used for soft-power propaganda.</p>

## The impact of competition and DeepSeek on Nvidia

date: 2025-01-27, updated: 2025-01-27, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://youtubetranscriptoptimizer.com/blog/05_the_short_case_for_nvda">The impact of competition and DeepSeek on Nvidia</a></strong></p>
Long, excellent piece by Jeffrey Emanuel capturing the current state of the AI/LLM industry. The original title is "The Short Case for Nvidia Stock" - I'm using the Hacker News alternative title here, but even that I feel under-sells this essay.</p>
<p>Jeffrey has a rare combination of experience in both computer science and investment analysis. He combines both worlds here, evaluating NVIDIA's challenges by providing deep insight into a whole host of relevant and interesting topics.</p>
<p>As Jeffrey describes it, NVIDA's moat has four components: high-quality Linux drivers, CUDA as an industry standard, the fast GPU interconnect technology they acquired from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mellanox_Technologies">Mellanox</a> in 2019 and the flywheel effect where they can invest their enormous profits (75-90% margin in some cases!) into more R&amp;D.</p>
<p>Each of these is under threat.</p>
<p>Technologies like <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/mlx/">MLX</a>, Triton and JAX are undermining the CUDA advantage by making it easier for ML developers to target multiple backends - plus LLMs themselves are getting capable enough to help port things to alternative architectures.</p>
<p>GPU interconnect helps multiple GPUs work together on tasks like model training. Companies like Cerebras are developing <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/16/cerebras-yield-problem/">enormous chips</a> that can get way more done on a single chip.</p>
<p>Those 75-90% margins provide a huge incentive for other companies to catch up - including the customers who spend the most on NVIDIA at the moment - Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Google, Apple - all of whom have their own internal silicon projects:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, it's no secret that there is a strong power law distribution of Nvidia's hyper-scaler customer base, with the top handful of customers representing the lion's share of high-margin revenue. How should one think about the future of this business when literally every single one of these VIP customers is building their own custom chips specifically for AI training and inference?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The real joy of this article is the way it describes technical details of modern LLMs in a relatively accessible manner. I love this description of the inference-scaling tricks used by O1 and R1, compared to traditional transformers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Basically, the way Transformers work in terms of predicting the next token at each step is that, if they start out on a bad "path" in their initial response, they become almost like a prevaricating child who tries to spin a yarn about why they are actually correct, even if they should have realized mid-stream using common sense that what they are saying couldn't possibly be correct.</p>
<p>Because the models are always seeking to be internally consistent and to have each successive generated token flow naturally from the preceding tokens and context, it's very hard for them to course-correct and backtrack. By breaking the inference process into what is effectively many intermediate stages, they can try lots of different things and see what's working and keep trying to course-correct and try other approaches until they can reach a fairly high threshold of confidence that they aren't talking nonsense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last quarter of the article talks about the seismic waves rocking the industry right now caused by <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/deepseek/">DeepSeek</a> v3 and R1. v3 remains the top-ranked open weights model, despite being around 45x more efficient in training than its competition: bad news if you are selling GPUs! R1 represents another huge breakthrough in efficiency both for training and for inference - the DeepSeek R1 API is currently 27x cheaper than OpenAI's o1, for a similar level of quality.</p>
<p>Jeffrey summarized some of the key ideas from the <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3/blob/main/DeepSeek_V3.pdf">v3 paper</a> like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A major innovation is their sophisticated mixed-precision training framework that lets them use 8-bit floating point numbers (FP8) throughout the entire training process. [...]</p>
<p>DeepSeek cracked this problem by developing a clever system that breaks numbers into small tiles for activations and blocks for weights, and strategically uses high-precision calculations at key points in the network. Unlike other labs that train in high precision and then compress later (losing some quality in the process), DeepSeek's native FP8 approach means they get the massive memory savings without compromising performance. When you're training across thousands of GPUs, this dramatic reduction in memory requirements per GPU translates into needing far fewer GPUs overall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then for <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948">R1</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With R1, DeepSeek essentially cracked one of the holy grails of AI: getting models to reason step-by-step without relying on massive supervised datasets. Their DeepSeek-R1-Zero experiment showed something remarkable: using pure reinforcement learning with carefully crafted reward functions, they managed to get models to develop sophisticated reasoning capabilities completely autonomously. This wasn't just about solving problems— the model organically learned to generate long chains of thought, self-verify its work, and allocate more computation time to harder problems.</p>
<p>The technical breakthrough here was their novel approach to reward modeling. Rather than using complex neural reward models that can lead to "reward hacking" (where the model finds bogus ways to boost their rewards that don't actually lead to better real-world model performance), they developed a clever rule-based system that combines accuracy rewards (verifying final answers) with format rewards (encouraging structured thinking). This simpler approach turned out to be more robust and scalable than the process-based reward models that others have tried.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This article is packed with insights like that - it's worth spending the time absorbing the whole thing.
