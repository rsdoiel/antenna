id="building-python-tools-with-a-one-shot-prompt-using-uv-run-and-claude-projects">Building
Python tools with a one-shot prompt using uv run and Claude
Projects</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-19, updated: 2024-12-19, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
I’ve written a lot about how I’ve been using Claude to build one-shot
HTML+JavaScript applications
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude-artifacts/">via Claude
Artifacts</a>. I recently started using a similar pattern to create
one-shot Python utilities, using a custom Claude Project combined with
the dependency management capabilities of
<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a>.
</p>
<p>
(In LLM jargon a “one-shot” prompt is a prompt that produces the
complete desired result on the first attempt.)
</p>
<p>
I’ll start with an example of a tool I built that way.
</p>
<p>
I had another round of battle with Amazon S3 today trying to figure out
why a file in one of my buckets couldn’t be accessed via a public URL.
</p>
<p>
Out of frustration I prompted Claude with a variant of the following
(<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/9f69cf35889b0445b80eeed691d44504">full
transcript here</a>):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>I can’t access the file at EXAMPLE_S3_URL. Write me a Python CLI
tool using Click and boto3 which takes a URL of that form and then uses
EVERY single boto3 trick in the book to try and debug why the file is
returning a 404</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It wrote me
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/python/debug_s3_access.py">this
script</a>, which gave me exactly what I needed. I ran it like this:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>uv run debug_s3_access.py \
  https://test-public-bucket-simonw.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/0f550b7b28264d7ea2b3d360e3381a95.jpg</pre>
</div>
<p>
<img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/debug-s3.jpg" alt="Terminal screenshot showing S3 access analysis results. Command: '$ uv run http://tools.simonwillison.net/python/debug_s3_access.py url-to-image' followed by detailed output showing bucket exists (Yes), region (default), key exists (Yes), bucket policy (AllowAllGetObject), bucket owner (swillison), versioning (Not enabled), content type (image/jpeg), size (71683 bytes), last modified (2024-12-19 03:43:30+00:00) and public access settings (all False)" style="max-width: 100%;" />
</p>
<p>
You can
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/tree/main/python#debug_s3_accesspy">see
the text output here</a>.
</p>
<h4 id="inline-dependencies-and-uv-run">
Inline dependencies and uv run
</h4>
<p>
Crucially, I didn’t have to take any extra steps to install any of the
dependencies that the script needed. That’s because the script starts
with this magic comment:
</p>
<pre><span class="pl-c"># /// script</span>
<span class="pl-c"># requires-python = "&gt;=3.12"</span>
<span class="pl-c"># dependencies = [</span>
<span class="pl-c">#     "click",</span>
<span class="pl-c">#     "boto3",</span>
<span class="pl-c">#     "urllib3",</span>
<span class="pl-c">#     "rich",</span>
<span class="pl-c"># ]</span>
<span class="pl-c"># ///</span></pre>
<p>
This is an example of
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/#declaring-script-dependencies">inline
script dependencies</a>, a feature described in
<a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/">PEP 723</a> and implemented
by <code>uv run</code>. Running the script causes <code>uv</code> to
create a temporary virtual environment with those dependencies
installed, a process that takes just a few milliseconds once the
<code>uv</code> cache has been populated.
</p>
<p>
This even works if the script is specified by a URL! Anyone with
<code>uv</code> installed can run the following command (provided you
trust me not to have replaced the script with something malicious) to
debug one of their own S3 buckets:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>uv run http://tools.simonwillison.net/python/debug_s3_access.py \
  https://test-public-bucket-simonw.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/0f550b7b28264d7ea2b3d360e3381a95.jpg</pre>
</div>
<h4 id="writing-these-with-the-help-of-a-claude-project">
Writing these with the help of a Claude Project
</h4>
<p>
The reason I can one-shot scripts like this now is that I’ve set up a
<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/projects">Claude Project</a>
called “Python app”. Projects can have custom instructions, and I used
those to “teach” Claude how to take advantage of inline script
dependencies:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
You write Python tools as single files. They always start with this
comment:
</p>
<pre><span># /// script</span>
<span># requires-python = "&gt;=3.12"</span>
<span># ///</span></pre>
<p>
These files can include dependencies on libraries such as Click. If they
do, those dependencies are included in a list like this one in that same
comment (here showing two dependencies):
</p>
<pre><span># /// script</span>
<span># requires-python = "&gt;=3.12"</span>
<span># dependencies = [</span>
<span>#     "click",</span>
<span>#     "sqlite-utils",</span>
<span># ]</span>
<span># ///</span></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
That’s everything Claude needs to reliably knock out full-featured
Python tools as single scripts which can be run directly using whatever
dependencies Claude chose to include.
</p>
<p>
I didn’t suggest that Claude use
<a href="https://github.com/Textualize/rich">rich</a> for the
<code>debug_s3_access.py</code> script earlier but it decided to use it
anyway!
</p>
<p>
I’ve only recently started experimenting with this pattern but it seems
to work <em>really</em> well. Here’s another example - my prompt was:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>Starlette web app that provides an API where you pass in ?url= and
it strips all HTML tags and returns just the text, using
beautifulsoup</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here’s
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/08957a1490ebde1ea38b4a8374989cf8">the
chat transcript</a> and
<a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/simonw/08957a1490ebde1ea38b4a8374989cf8/raw/143ee24dc65ca109b094b72e8b8c494369e763d6/strip_html.py">the
raw code it produced</a>. You can run that server directly on your
machine (it uses port 8000) like this:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre>uv run https://gist.githubusercontent.com/simonw/08957a1490ebde1ea38b4a8374989cf8/raw/143ee24dc65ca109b094b72e8b8c494369e763d6/strip_html.py</pre>
</div>
<p>
Then visit
<code>http://127.0.0.1:8000/?url=https://simonwillison.net/</code> to
see it in action.
</p>
<h4 id="custom-instructions">
Custom instructions
</h4>
<p>
The pattern here that’s most interesting to me is using custom
instructions or system prompts to show LLMs how to implement new
patterns that may not exist in their training data. <code>uv run</code>
is less than a year old, but providing just a short example is enough to
get the models to write code that takes advantage of its capabilities.
</p>
<p>
I have a similar set of custom instructions I use for creating single
page HTML and JavaScript tools, again running in a Claude Project:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Never use React in artifacts - always plain HTML and vanilla JavaScript
and CSS with minimal dependencies.
</p>
<p>
CSS should be indented with two spaces and should start like this:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-text-html-basic">
<pre><span class="pl-kos">&lt;</span><span class="pl-ent">style</span><span class="pl-kos">&gt;</span>
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}</pre>
</div>
<p>
Inputs and textareas should be font size 16px. Font should always prefer
Helvetica.
</p>
<p>
JavaScript should be two space indents and start like this:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-text-html-basic">
<pre><span class="pl-kos">&lt;</span><span class="pl-ent">script</span> <span class="pl-c1">type</span>="<span class="pl-s">module</span>"<span class="pl-kos">&gt;</span>
// code in here should not be indented at the first level</pre>
</div>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="java-in-the-small">Java in the Small</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-18, updated: 2024-12-18, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://horstmann.com/unblog/2024-12-11/index.html">Java
in the Small</a></strong>
</p>
Core Java author Cay Horstmann describes how he now uses Java for small
programs, effectively taking the place of a scripting language such as
Python.
</p>
<p>
TIL that hello world in Java can now look like this - saved as
<code>hello.java</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>void main(String[] args) {
    println("Hello world");
}
</code></pre>
<p>
And then run (using <code>openjdk 23.0.1</code> on my Mac, installed at
some point by Homebrew) like this:
</p>
<pre><code>java --enable-preview hello.java
</code></pre>
<p>
This is so much less unpleasant than the traditional, boiler-plate
filled Hello World I grew up with:
</p>
<pre><code>public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
<p>I always hated how many concepts you had to understand just to print
out a line of text. Great to see that isn’t the case any more with
modern Java.</p>

<h2 id="a-new-free-tier-for-github-copilot-in-vs-code">A new free tier
for GitHub Copilot in VS Code</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-18, updated: 2024-12-18, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-in-vscode-free/">A
new free tier for GitHub Copilot in VS Code</a></strong>
</p>
It’s easy to forget that GitHub Copilot was the first widely deployed
feature built on top of generative AI, with its initial preview
launching all the way back in June of 2021 and general availability in
June 2022, 5 months before the release of ChatGPT.
</p>
<p>
The idea of using generative AI for autocomplete in a text editor is a
really significant innovation, and is still my favorite example of a
non-chat UI for interacting with models.
</p>
<p>
Copilot evolved <em>a lot</em> over the past few years, most notably
through the addition of
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/asking-github-copilot-questions-in-your-ide">Copilot
Chat</a>, a chat interface directly in VS Code. I’ve only recently
started adopting that myself - the ability to add files into the context

Today’s announcement of a permanent free tier (as opposed to a trial)
for anyone with a GitHub account is clearly designed to encourage people
to upgrade to a full subscription. Free users get 2,000 code completions
and 50 chat messages per month, with the option of switching between
GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been using Copilot for free thanks to their open source maintainer
program for a while, which
<a href="https://github.com/pricing#i-work-on-open-source-projects-can-i-get-access-to-github-copilot-for-free">is
still in effect today</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
People who maintain popular open source projects receive a credit to
have 12 months of GitHub Copilot access for free. A maintainer of a
popular open source project is defined as someone who has write or admin
access to one or more of the most popular open source projects on
GitHub. […] Once awarded, if you are still a maintainer of a popular
open source project when your initial 12 months subscription expires
then you will be able to renew your subscription for free.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It wasn’t instantly obvious to me how to switch models. The option for
that is next to the chat input window here, though you may need to
enable Sonnet in the

polite disagreement bot ring is flooding Bluesky — reply guy as a
(dis)service</a></strong>
</p>
Fascinating new pattern of AI slop engagement farming: people are
running bots on Bluesky that automatically reply to “respectfully
disagree” with posts, in an attempt to goad the original author into
replying to continue an argument.
</p>
<p>
It’s not entirely clear what the intended benefit is here: unlike
Twitter there’s no way to monetize (yet) a Bluesky account through
growing a following there - and replies like this don’t look likely to
earn followers.

One of the bots leaked part of its prompt (nothing public I can link to

<code>Your response should be a clear and respectful disagreement, but
it must be brief and under 300 characters. Here’s a possible response:
“I’m concerned that your willingness to say you need time to think about
a complex issue like the pardon suggests a lack of preparedness and
critical thinking.”</code>
