date: 2024-12-09, from: Aaron Bos blog

## Episode 127 - Molecular Electronic Computer

date: 2024-12-09, from: Advent of Computing

<p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">In 1961 Texas Instruments unveiled the Molecular Electronic Computer, aka: Mol-E-Com. It was a machine that fit in the palm of your hand, but had all the power of a much larger computer. This was in an age of hefty machines, which made the achievement all the more marvelous. How was this even possible? It was all thanks to the wonders of molecular electronics, and a boat load of funding from the US Air Force.</p> <p>Selected Sources:</p> <p> <a href= "https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071831/http://corphist.computerhistory.org/corphist/documents/doc-496d289787271.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-link-auto= "">https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071831/http://corphist.computerhistory.org/corphist/documents/doc-496d289787271.pdf</a> - Invention of the Integrated Circuit, Kilby</p> <p><a href= "https://archive.org/details/DTIC_AD0411614/page/n15/mode/2up" rel= "noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-link-auto= "">https://archive.org/details/DTIC_AD0411614/page/n15/mode/2up</a> - Investigation of Silicon Functional Blocks, TI</p> <p><a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/AD0273850.pdf" rel= "noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/AD0273850.pdf</a> - Silicon Semiconductor Networks, TI</p>
