## The Family-Sized Hole in the Electric Car Market

date: 2024-02-20, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTUxMDMyOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxNDAwODQ0Nn0.c7OKUocMGuBuJSNubgoXfAB2Jfgi8xeRdTW9uCp1IvI/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">The exemplar of the American “family car” is an ever-changing thing. Mid-century land yachts gave way to wood-paneled <a href="https://fraserengineco.com/fraser-fast-facts/wagon-queen-family-truckster/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Griswold family station wagons</a>. The SUV craze of the 1990s established vehicles like the forest green Eddie Bauer Ford Explorer I grew up in as the de facto kid-haulers, especially for parents who wouldn’t be caught dead in a minivan. Today’s suburb-dominating soccer-practice crossovers are their spiritual descendants.</p><p>Now, though, the question of which car is right for a family has a new wrinkle: <em>Should we get an electric vehicle? </em>Unfortunately, the answer for most people who survey the auto landscape appears to be, “not yet,” a fact that has contributed to the current feeling of EV limbo.</p><p><br/></p><p class="drop-caps">The right family car depends upon your family. My Tesla Model 3 happily accommodates a newborn, a dog, and a stroller that lives in the trunk. For most Americans, though, the family car has come to mean something much larger than my ride: a tall, spacious, affordable, safe, and reliable crossover with lots of room for endless kid gear and clutter. Three rows are a must for those with a flock of kids.</p><p>Therein lies the trouble with today’s EV fleet. Check <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/te7y2s/ev_for_family/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">online</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/comments/17piiil/family_car_ice_or_ev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">conversations</a> between parents about the available options and it becomes clear that perhaps no available electric fits the bill perfectly. The top-selling Tesla Model Y is a crossover, but not a huge one, and the available choices like it, the Volkswagen ID.4, and the Ford Mustang Mach-E are going to cost you more than $40,000, not counting EV tax breaks. Truly spacious EVs like the Rivian R1S and Tesla Model X have prices that soar to $70,000 or more. Well-regarded electrics such as the Hyundai Ioniq5 and 6 can’t match the cargo space of your neighbors’ combustion crossover. (Ioniq5 has 27 cubic ft. in the back and the Model Y about 30, versus 37.5 for the typical Toyota RAV4 and nearly 40 for the Honda CR-V.) The parental consensus in many of those Reddit threads? The best electric family ride is the Chrysler Pacifica plug-in hybrid minivan, which delivers 32 electric miles before it reverts to gas.</p><p>A new slate of EVs is just starting to fill in this obvious hole. The forthcoming <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/chevrolet/equinox-ev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chevy Equinox EV</a>, in addition to carrying the name of a top-selling familiar, safe family car, is supposed to start at a more reasonable $35,000. Kia used a Super Bowl ad to show off the <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/super-bowl-lviii-kia-volkswagen-bmw" target="_self">EV9</a>, one of the first giant three-row family crossovers to go full EV, and <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/hyundai/ioniq-7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hyundai’s Ioniq7</a> will soon follow. The ID.Buzz, an update to the classic VW bus, brings an all-electric minivan to the market. When it comes down to a car-buying decision, though, the dealer lots of America are still wanting for a simple mom-and-dad-mobile to compete with the $30,000 starting price of the Honda CR-V.</p><p>This gap helps to explain some of the gloom around electric vehicle sales in 2024. Nearly all the car companies have some kind of true EV on the market by now, but most of those entrants require buyers to navigate the confusing, fluid EV tax breaks in order for them to be competitive with gasoline counterparts. For EVs to make the leap from the early adoption to the mass adoption state, we need a truly cheap car like what Tesla and Ford are <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/redwood-is-exactly-what-tesla-needs" target="_self">reportedly developing</a> for entry-level carbuyers, yes (though, to Detroit’s chagrin, it just might come from <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ford-gm-stellantis-byd" target="_self">China</a>.) But we also need family-sized EVs that compete on price with the well-known suburban warriors.</p><p><br/></p><p class="drop-caps">Here’s the bright side. The EV space may be in a “gap year,” but electric vehicles will soon become big and cheap enough to take their place as the family car. They will be great at it, and families will get to experience the ways that <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/why-are-electric-cars-better" target="_self">electric driving is better</a>.</p><p>Now that EVs come with battery ranges around 300 miles, a person can drive down the highway for several hours without stopping to charge. In other words, the kid’s need for a bathroom, not the need to charge, will be the primary motivator behind pit stops. </p><p>An EV’s <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-battery-ac-dc-bidirectional" target="_self">ability</a> to use its battery power for applications other than driving is tailor-made for the family. While picking up a kid — and waiting for them to come get in the car already — one can run the air conditioner indefinitely and watch Netflix on the big center screen without running a gasoline engine and polluting the neighborhood. Child can’t sleep in the tent on their first camping trip? Sleep in the car all night with Camp Mode on.</p><p>Any errand avoided is a gift from the gods, which is why so many parents now rely on online shopping for durable goods and apps like Instacart to deliver the groceries. For those who can charge at home or at work, EV ownership negates the extra stop at the gas station on the way home, the one where the little ones ask, over and over, whether they can get some junk food from the convenience store. The absence of oil changes is pretty great, too. And the first time you use the car’s battery to keep the house lights on during a blackout, you’ll feel like you really earned that World’s Greatest Dad (or Mom) coffee mug.</p><p>Don’t believe the doom, then. Unless you’re buying a vehicle right now, your next family car probably <em>is</em> going to be an EV.</p>

## Supreme Court Rejects Appeal From Trump-Allied Lawyers Over 2020 Election Lawsuit

date: 2024-02-20, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected an appeal from Sidney Powell and other lawyers allied with former President Donald Trump over $150,000 in sanctions they were ordered to pay for abusing the court system with a sham lawsuit challenging the 2020 election results in Michigan. 


The justices did not comment in leaving in place the sanctions against seven lawyers who were part of the lawsuit filed on behalf of six Republican voters after Joe Biden's 154,000-vote victory over Trump in the state. 


Among the lawyers is L. Lin Wood, whose name was on the lawsuit. Wood has insisted he had no role other than to tell Powell he would be available if she needed a seasoned litigator. 


The money is owed to the state and Detroit, for their costs in defending the lawsuit. The sanctions initially totaled $175,000, but a federal appeals court reduced them by about $25,000. 


In October, Powell pleaded guilty to state criminal charges in Georgia over her efforts to overturn Trump's loss in the state. She pleaded guilty to six misdemeanors accusing her of conspiring to intentionally interfere with the performance of election duties. 


Powell gained notoriety for saying in November 2020 that she would "release the Kraken," invoking a mythical sea monster when talking about a lawsuit she planned to file to challenge the results of the presidential election.

## Background on that Capital One-Discover deal

date: 2024-02-20, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Once upon a time, Sears department stores were everywhere. A subsidiary of Sears launched the Discover card in 1986. It wasn’t unusual for department stores to offer their own credits cards, but the Discover card was accepted by other merchants. Today, we&#8217;ll hear a brief primer on the history that predated the recently announced Capital One-Discover purchase. Plus, China slashes mortgage rates, and northeastern Spain faces tough water restrictions.</p>

## Ski boot sizing

<p>One thing that's great about ChatGPT is they can help you make a decision in an area you lack expertise and where there is no human you can ask for help making the decision. It's making this human smarter, and it's hard to see the downside of that. </p>
<p>Here's an <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/be9ca3a4-4e74-4fe0-a778-d5595fe8482d">example</a>. I'm trying to decide whether I should get size 11 rental ski boots or size 11.5.

Surely there must be people inside the NYT that find <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/02/20/exhaustedPeopleAtNYTimes.png">this</a> as exhausting as we do. How can we set up a receptacle for leaks from inside the NYT and WP so we can get the truth about who's selling us out to Trump and Putin inside those supposedly great public-serving news orgs?

## Pluralistic: Pluralistic is four; The Bezzle excerpt (Part III) (20 Feb 2024)

date: 2024-02-20, from: Cory Doctorow's blog

Today's links Pluralistic is four: Reflections on four years of Memex Method, Phase II. The Bezzle excerpt (Part III): In which Steve Soul lawyers up. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading Pluralistic is four (permalink) Four years ago, I started pluralistic.net, my post-Boing Boing, solo blog project: an ad-free, tracker-free site that anyone can republish, commercially or noncommercially. It's been a wild four years, featuring over 1,150 editions, many consisting of multiple articles: https://pluralistic.net/2020/02/19/pluralist-19-feb-2020/ As a project, Pluralistic has been a roaring success. I've published multiple, significant "breakout" articles that popularized obscure, important, highly technical ideas, most notably "adversarial interoperability": http://pluralistic.net/tag/adversarial-interoperability "End-to-end" as a remedy for multiple internet ripoffs, including as a superior alternative to link-taxes as a means of saving the news industry from Big Tech predation: https://pluralistic.net/tag/e2e/ and, of course, "enshittification": https://pluralistic.net/tag/enshittification/ These are emblematic of the sorts of ideas that I've spent the past 20+ years trying to popularize in tech-policy debates dominated by technologically illiterate policy ideas ("abolish Section 230!") and politically illiterate technical ideas (so many to choose from, but let's just say "cryptocurrency"). They require that the reader come along for a lot of cross-disciplinary analysis that often gets deep into the weeds. These are some of the hardest ideas to convey, but nuanced proposals and critiques that work on both political and technical axes are the best hope we have of successfully weathering the polycrisis. Blogging has always been a part of this project. For nearly 20 years, I posted nearly every day on Boing Boing &#8211; 53,906 posts in all! &#8211; taking note of everything that seemed important. Keeping a "writer's notebook" in public imposes an unbeatable rigor, since you can't slack off and leave notes so brief and cryptic that they neither lodge in your subconscious nor form a record clear enough to refer to in future. By contrast, keeping public notes produces both a subconscious, supersaturated solution of fragmentary ideas that rattle around, periodically cohering into nucleii that crystallize into full-blown ideas for stories, novels, essays, speeches and nonfiction books. What's more, those ripened ideas are supported by a searchable database of everything I've thought about the subject, often annotated by readers and other writers who've commented on the posts. I call this "The Memex Method": https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/09/the-memex-method/ Pluralistic marks a new phase in my deployment of the Memex Method. With 50K+ notes in a database, I've gradually turned Pluralistic into a forum for far more synthetic, longer-form work that pulls on threads from decades of research into nothing in particular and everything that seemed important. Pluralistic is also an experiment in retaining control over my destiny &#8211; but not my work. Rather than hitching my ability to reach an audience through a platform that can be enshittified at the whim of a mercurial, infantile billionaire or their venal, callous shareholders, Pluralistic is published web-first, on a site I control, and then syndicated to every platform that matters to me. It's a process called POSSE (Post Own Site, Syndicate Everywhere): https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/13/two-decades/#hfbd I want to spread the ideas I fight for, so I post them everywhere, and license them Creative Commons Attribution-Only, encouraging others to repost them. Lots of small sites do this, but so do large ones. Notably, Wired picked up my first breakout piece on enshittification and republished it under the CC terms: https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/ This was a really interesting process. On the one hand, I didn't get paid for this feature, which did really well for Wired. On the other hand, nearly 30 years of writing for Wired makes me doubtful that I could have gotten this piece out in the form it emerged, without substantially toning down (or, if you prefer, neutering) the rhetoric that made that piece more persuasive. A commissioning editor from one of the largest newspapers in the world got in touch with me after it came out and said they wished they'd published it &#8211; but also that they knew they couldn't possibly have done so. By publishing the story first on my blog, proving its audience, and establishing its canonical form, I was able to get it amplified by a service with a much bigger platform than me, without having to compromise on the form. That republication gave me the much-maligned "exposure" &#8211; but it also carried the message to places it wouldn't have reached on its own. I don't write &#8211; have never written &#8211; solely as an income source. As both an artist and an activist, connecting with audiences has always been co-equal in my mind with earning my living. That's why I don't do a lot of film-writing: it pays well, but most of it never sees the light of day. It's also why I stopped writing for ad agencies: it paid well, but it didn't matter to me or my audience. To mangle Dr Johnson: "No man but a blockhead ever wrote solely for money." The open nature of this blog, with its many open syndication channels, creates multidirectional pathways for evaluating and refining my attempts at making my ideas understood and my art land. My posts often circle back to points I made earlier, incorporating useful feedback from readers and colleagues, sure, but also anticipating and rebutting those areas where critics have convinced others in various forums. Vanity searching is unjustly maligned: I learn a ton about how to make by work better by lurking in Reddit comments, Hacker News, Twitter, Slashdot, Metafilter and other forums. I also take a sneaky pleasure in knowing that the persistent trolls who reliably pop up to grind their weird axes about me (sometimes referencing blog posts I made decades ago) have taught me how to neutralize them in advance, and it's delightful to see them try their same old lines, only to have other commentators point out that my latest piece makes it absolutely undeniable how wrong they are. Living well is the best revenge, indeed. Four years. I've been writing Pluralistic for four years. During that time, I've published eight books &#8211; and beyond any doubt, Pluralistic helped me get those books into readers' hands. But far more importantly, during that time, I've written nine books &#8211; and contracted for a tenth &#8211; as the Memex Method paid off again and again. I don't know how long I'll do Pluralistic for, but I don't foresee stopping any time soon. What's more, no matter what happens to Pluralistic, I can't ever see giving up on the Memex Method, keeping notes in public and making them work for me. The Bezzle excerpt (Part III) (permalink) This week, I'm serializing part of chapter 14 from my new novel The Bezzle, which is out in stores TODAY (!!!): https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865878/thebezzle The Bezzle is a Martin Hench novel, the followup to last year's Red Team Blues &#8211; though each book in the series is designed to be read in any order, and to stand alone (RTB just came out in paperback): https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865854/redteamblues Hench is a two-fisted, high-tech forensic accountant whose career spans 40 years of busting high-tech scams, from the earliest days of the PC to the white-hot center of the cryptocurrency bubble. Each book revolves around a single, central scam (in The Bezzle, it's the unbelievably slimy prison-tech industry): https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/14/minnesota-nice/#shitty-technology-adoption-curve But each book also features lots of subplots that unpick different kinds of fraud. In this serialized excerpt, we get to watch Marty unwind a music royalty theft scheme, the kind of thing that Rebecca Giblin and I pulled apart in our 2022 book, Chokepoint Capitalism (also now in paperback!): https://chokepointcapitalism.com/ Today's installment gets into one of the major tactics of any semi-respectable scam &#8211; simply ignoring the victim in the hope that they'll get tired and go away. Any of us who've been ripped off by a big company can surely relate. I'm leaving on my tour for this one tomorrow, starting with a gig in Salt Lake City at Weller Bookworks (Feb 21) at 630PM: https://www.wellerbookworks.com/event/store-cory-doctorow-feb-21-630-pm From there, it's on to LA (with Adam Conover), Seattle (with Neal Stephenson) and many, many more cities &#8211; maybe one near you! https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/16/narrative-capitalism/#bezzle-tour Here's part one of the serial: https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/17/the-steve-soul-caper/#lead-singer-disease And part two: https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/19/crad-kilodney-was-an-outlier/#copyright-termination And now, onto part three! * * * Stefon cooked Jamal another dinner and Jamal wrote another letter, this one more forceful, and addressed to Gounder by name. Two weeks later, Jamal wrote another letter without needing dinner because “that motherfucker went to Harvard fucking law”—­Jamal had looked him up in the ALA directory—­“and he knows you can’t make legal problems go away just by ignoring them. Time for that piece of shit to put on his big-­boy pants and be a goddamned lawyer.” The one thing Jamal wouldn’t do was file a lawsuit. “You need a lawyer for that,” he said. “I mean, I can help you with the paperwork, but a paralegal can’t file the suit. And you shouldn’t file your own suit, either. Those guys’ll just hire some blow-dried asshole from a big law firm and they’ll crush you like a cockroach.” “Well, shit,” Stefon said. But it all made sense. Anyone doing business with Chuy Flores would do business like Chuy Flores—­that is, crooked as hell. “What you need is a contingency lawyer,” Jamal said. “Someone who’ll take the job for a piece of the action.” Which is how Stefon ended up being represented by Benny Caetani II, son of Benedetto Caetani, who graduated at the top of his Yale class, won a string of spectacular class-­action suits, then got disbarred after someone leaked calls where he admitted moving money from one client trust account into another to cover a shortfall. No one seriously thought that Benedetto was stealing anyone’s money—­he’d had receivables due within a week that let him make the trust account whole—­but he was also clearly guilty. Equally, no one seriously believed that the high-­powered surveillance that led to Benedetto’s downfall was random. Benedetto had transferred more than a hundred million dollars from the balance sheets of America’s largest, dirtiest corporations—­ poison-­peddling pharma giants, toxic-­waste-­dumping chemical companies, a global chain of botox parlors with some very loose syringes indeed—­and they were gunning for him. Officially, Benedetto was out of the lawyer game. Unofficially, he was the brains behind Benny, and the two of them ran a squeaky-­clean shop, making sure that everything that an actual lawyer had to do, Benny did—­while Benedetto did ­everything else. Father and son got along well and they were a hell of a team. When Benedetto called me in to audit Inglewood Jams’ books, I jumped at the opportunity. They were a delight to work for. “They played tough,” Benedetto said, as his minions arranged the bankers’ boxes on the steel kitchen shelves he’d had installed on the long walls of the storefront he’d rented for me to work out of for the month. “At first. Told me they didn’t owe Stefon a dime, and that they’d rather bankrupt themselves in court than pay some broken-­down, washed-­up disco king anything. Told me his problem was with Chuy, not Inglewood Jams.” “Well, to be fair, that Chuy guy sounds like a class-­A piece of shit.” “A broke piece of shit. Guy’s got a million-­dollar nose and an empty bank account.” “So you had to go after Inglewood Jams.” Benedetto twirled around in his Aeron chair. He’d sent over a pair of them, asking if I needed more, because he had a storage locker full of them that he’d gotten as part of a settlement with a broke Santa Monica crowdsourcing company that stiffed its workers when it folded. “I did. I went after them. That Gounder lawyer tried to bluff, then when that didn’t work, he tried to dodge service. Which was such a kindergarten move. Plus he was no good at it. Caught him outside the rub-­and-­tug parlor he went to every Friday after work. Handed him the papers. Wore a bodycam. Didn’t mention his wife. Didn’t have to.” “You think he settled because he didn’t want his wife to find out he was getting hand jobs at a massage parlor?” “No, he held out awhile after that. But I could see it preying on him, every time I was face-­to-­face with him. Eventually, he musta told his bosses that they were gonna lose, and so they offered a settlement. It was trash. I laughed in his face. He tossed out some better offers, but none of them even in the ballpark of what we would get in court. Finally, I told him to get serious or send his court suit out to the dry cleaner’s. That’s when he offered to make Stefon whole and pay me a little for my trouble on top of things.” I suppressed a snort. I was sure that a little on top amounted to some real folding money. “Even then he tried to pull a fast one, told me he’d calculate Stefon’s royalties and send a check the next week. I was like, ‘Hold up, there is no way you’re going to be able to make an honest accounting for Stefon’s royalties in a week. The dude’s samples are in hundreds of songs. The mere fact that you claimed that you could come up with a fair amount in a week tells me you were planning to pull a lowball number out of your ass and pass it off as the audited total, so tell you what, I’m gonna get the best forensic accountant in the state of California to come down here to LA and crawl all over your papers, and you are going to send him everything he needs to do it, or we’re going to court, motherfucker.” “And he agreed?” “Hell no. He refused. We went to a preliminary hearing. Judge turned out to be a classic soul fan. It didn’t go well for Gounder or Inglewood. The next day, he was back in my office, and now, well, here we are.” Hey look at this (permalink) Manulife reversed its pharmacy deal with Loblaw’s Shoppers Drug Mart – so what? https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-manulife-reversed-its-pharmacy-deal-with-loblaws-shoppers-drug-mart-so/ (h/t Regs to Riches) Are We Transitioning From Capitalism to Silicon Serfdom? https://jacobin.com/2024/02/yanis-varoufakis-techno-feudalism-capitalism-interview/ Every Time We Meet for Ice Cream Your Whole F*cking Face Explodes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orfDpGNh_kc (h/t Nelson Minar) This day in history (permalink) #20yrsago GreyTuesday: mass mirroring of the Grey Album https://web.archive.org/web/20040220061627/http://www.greytuesday.org/ #15yrsago Terry Pratchett gets a knighthood https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7896865.stm #15yrsago Irish cops finally “catch” Prawo Jazdy https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/7899171.stm?lss #10yrsago Ukraine security forces torch #euromaidan’s IT tent, kill journalist, beat tech protester to near-death https://web.archive.org/web/20140302031342/http://it-namet.com.ua/news/zayava-it-spilnoti-shodo-podij-19-lyutogo #10yrsago Survivors of the Florida School for Boys return to the site of legal kidnapping, torture and murder of children https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/02/returning-to-dozier-florida-school-for-boys/ #10yrsago XKCD’s brilliant explanation of Fermi Estimation https://what-if.xkcd.com/84/ #10yrsago NH legislator introduces bill to stop small-town cops from buying tanks https://www.techdirt.com/2014/02/18/new-hampshire-state-legislator-hopes-to-push-back-against-police-militarization-with-new-bill/ #10yrsago Detailed analysis of Syria’s network censorship with logs from Blue Coat’s surveillance boxes https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.3401.pdf #5yrsago Scientists finally explain why microwaved grapes emit glorious bursts of plasma https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1818350116 #5yrsago “We take your privacy and security seriously” is the “thoughts and prayers” of data-breaches https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/17/we-take-your-privacy-and-security-seriously/ #5yrsago Study suggests that Flat Eartherism spread via Youtube https://aaas.confex.com/aaas/2018/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/21432 #5yrsago Publisher of Alabama newspaper calls for the Klan to ride on DC with “hemp ropes” https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2019/02/18/alabama-newspaper-ku-klux-klan-to-night-ride-again-linden-democrat-reporter-goodloe-sutton/2910436002/ #5yrsago Ontario parliamentarian calls for Right to Repair legislation https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/02/18/ontario-mpp-right-repair/ #5yrsago EU Commission calls opponents of Copyright Directive a “mob,” as thousands take to the streets for the #Artikel13Demo https://torrentfreak.com/eu-commission-deletes-article-13-post-because-mob-understood-it-incorrectly-190218/N #1yrago Twiddler https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/19/twiddler/ #1yrago Pluralistic is three https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/19/drei-drei-drei/#now-we-are-three Colophon (permalink) Today's top sources: Currently writing: A Little Brother short story about DIY insulin PLANNING Picks and Shovels, a Martin Hench noir thriller about the heroic era of the PC.

## This New Interactive Tool Can Help Inform Climate Policy

<em><strong>Current conditions: </strong>A tropical storm has formed in the South Atlantic for the first time in three years • Ongoing wildfires in Chile forced residents to evacuate • It’s 51 degrees Fahrenheit and cloudy in London where a pod of dolphins was spotted in the River Thames. </em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Hawaii considers charging tourists to enter</h3><p>
<strong></strong>Hawaii may introduce a $25 tourist fee this spring to help protect the state from wildfires. Hawaii’s Democratic governor, Josh Green, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=09f8dc480e&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a><em> The Wall Street Journal </em>the fee would bring in close to $70 million annually, and that the money would pay for things like fire breaks, disaster prevention and insurance, and establishing a state fire marshal. “It’s a very small price to pay to preserve paradise,” Green said. Hawaii is still recovering from the deadly Lahaina wildfires that struck Maui last year. The tourist fee would follow a larger trend of visitors being asked to help contribute to climate resilience efforts in high-risk destinations across the world.

</p><h3>3. EU industry CEOs fret over energy shift</h3><p>
<strong></strong>A bunch of European industrial business leaders are worried their firms are losing their competitive edge in the energy transition, and they want the EU to do something about it. About 70 CEOs from major European companies are petitioning the EU to introduce a “European Industrial Deal” that would reduce energy costs, boost funding for clean tech, cut red tape, and limit companies’ reporting obligations. “The group says Europe risks losing out to China and the U.S. in the race to supply the technologies needed to roll out renewables and slash industrial emissions,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=7fa327c07a&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">reported</a> <em>Bloomberg</em>. Ursula von der Leyen will join the group in Antwerp today in a bid to garner support as she launches her bid for a second term as European Commission president.

<strong></strong>A French company that manufactures parts for about half the world’s cars is cutting 10,000 jobs as the global shift to electric vehicles changes the automotive landscape, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e09df82bc0&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">reported</a> <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>. Forvia provides exhaust systems as well as interiors for carmakers including Ford, Tesla, Stellantis, and Volkswagen. The cuts, which will happen over the next five years, come as the company strives to stay competitive as new policies in the EU favor electric vehicles, and Chinese carmakers like BYD look to expand. Automotive suppliers “have made hefty investments in the shift to electric, and now they are seeing their markets being hit due to slower uptake than expected,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=4fd766f731&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> Jennifer Mossalgue at <em>Electrek</em>.
</p><h3>5. Culture wars target lab-grown meat</h3><p>
<strong></strong>Florida is one of a handful of states trying to ban lab-grown meat, seen by some as a potential way to help cut the greenhouse gas emissions of the meat and dairy industries. A new bill in the state legislature would make it a misdemeanor to sell or manufacture lab-grown meat (which is made from animal cells), and anyone caught doing so would be fined $1,000. “The development of lab-grown meat has been drawn into America’s culture wars, like other ventures aimed at disrupting traditional food production,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=ed0dd067f8&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">explained</a><em> The New York Times</em>. The irony is that “it likely will be years before lab-grown meat is a staple on dinner plates in America, if it happens at all.”

## One less credit card company, one more giant bank. Maybe.

date: 2024-02-20, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Capital One says it’s reached an all-stock deal to take over Discover Financial Services. The acquisition would create a stronger rival to Visa and Mastercard, but it&#8217;s far from a done deal and is likely to face heavy scrutiny from regulators. Also on the show: why the average age of Americans farmer is on the rise, and what the producer price index can reveal about inflationary trends.</p>

## The Cost of Courage

date: 2024-02-20, from: Dan Rather's Steady

Courage is the moral strength to venture, persevere, and withstand danger, fear, or difficulty, according to Merriam-Webster. It comes from the Latin cor, meaning heart. My father instilled in me a respect for the word and the ideal when I was very ill as a young child.

## Microsoft Is Spying on Users of Its AI Tools

date: 2024-02-20, updated: 2024-02-19, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Microsoft announced that it <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/02/14/us-adversaries-using-artificial-intelligence-boost-hacking-efforts/">caught</a> Chinese, Russian, and Iranian hackers using its AI tools&#8212;presumably coding tools&#8212;to improve their hacking abilities.</p>
<p>From their <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-insider/reports/cyber-signals/cyber-signals-issue-6-navigating-cyberthreats-and-strengthening-defenses/">report</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In collaboration with OpenAI, we are sharing threat intelligence showing detected state affiliated adversaries&#8212;tracked as Forest Blizzard, Emerald Sleet, Crimson Sandstorm, Charcoal Typhoon, and Salmon Typhoon&#8212;using LLMs to augment cyberoperations.</p></blockquote>
<p>The only way Microsoft or OpenAI would know this would be to spy on chatbot sessions. I&#8217;m sure the terms of service&#8212;if I bothered to read them&#8212;gives them that permission. And of course it&#8217;s no surprise that Microsoft and OpenAI (and, presumably, everyone else) are spying on our usage of AI, but this confirms it...</p>

## The surprising truth about pixels and accessibility

date: 2024-02-20, from: OS News

Should web developers use pixels or ems/rems for accessible fonts? It&#8217;s an emotionally-charged question because there are a lot of conflicting opinions out there, and it can be overwhelming. Maybe you&#8217;ve heard that rems are better for accessibility. Or maybe you&#8217;ve heard that the problem is fixed and pixels are fine? The truth is, if you want to build the most-accessible product possible, you need to use both pixels and ems/rems. It&#8217;s not an either/or situation. There are circumstances where rems are more accessible, and other circumstances where pixels are more accessible. ↫ Joshua Comeau The linked article isn&#8217;t just an explanation of why, but also a tutorial.

## Reddit sells training data to unnamed AI company ahead of IPO

date: 2024-02-20, from: OS News

On Friday, Bloomberg reported that Reddit has signed a contract allowing an unnamed AI company to train its models on the site&#8217;s content, according to people familiar with the matter. The move comes as the social media platform nears the introduction of its initial public offering (IPO), which could happen as soon as next month. Reddit initially revealed the deal, which is reported to be worth $60 million a year, earlier in 2024 to potential investors of an anticipated IPO, Bloomberg said. The Bloomberg source speculates that the contract could serve as a model for future agreements with other AI companies. ↫ Benj Edwards at Ars Technica Properly paying for the content you&#8217;re feeding into your &#8220;AI&#8221; model is a huge improvement over just taking it without users&#8217; consent, but it does add yet another area of concern for users of all kinds of platforms. Whatever you write, create, or post might be fed into &#8220;AI&#8221; models without you ever realising it, and while the platform you use gets paid for that, you aren&#8217;t. In any event, OSNews is not selling your comments to an &#8220;AI&#8221; company, but with how old we are, there&#8217;s no doubt both your comments and our stories have already found their way into countless &#8220;AI&#8221; black holes.

## GhostBSD 24.01.1 released

date: 2024-02-20, from: OS News

This new release is based on FreeBSD 14.0-STABLE. Update Station got a significant change to upgrade to a major FreeBSD version, allowing upgrading GhostBSD from 13.2-STABLE to 14.0-STABLE. Also, a major change to the installer is the user created is an admin, and the root user gets the same password as the admin. If the admin password is changed after the installation, the root password will not change. ↫ GhostBSD&#8217;s website GhostBSD is a user-friendly, desktop-first &#8216;distribution&#8217; of FreeBSD &#8211; a project which, in my humble view, should be part of the FreeBSD project-proper. With some old-time Linux feeling a sense of disenfranchisement towards Linux due to things like Wayland and systemd, FreeBSD could serve as an excellent alternative, and an official desktop-first ISO could play a role in that. Of course, that&#8217;s not exactly core to FreeBSD&#8217;s mission, and they really shouldn&#8217;t be listening to idiots like me, but I think it&#8217;s an idea worth pondering.

## Global Operation Smashes 'Most Harmful Cyber Crime Group'

date: 2024-02-20, from: VOA News USA

LONDON — An international operation led by UK and U.S. law enforcement has severely disrupted "the world's most harmful cybercrime group", the Russian-linked ransomware specialist LockBit, officials announced Tuesday. 

 

LockBit and its affiliates have targeted governments, major companies, schools and hospitals, causing billions of dollars of damage and extracting tens of millions in ransoms from victims. 

 

Britain's National Crime Agency (NCA), working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Europol and agencies from nine other countries in Operation Cronos, said it had infiltrated LockBit's network and taken control of its services. 

 

"We have hacked the hackers, we have taken control of their infrastructure, seized their source code, and obtained keys that will help victims decrypt their systems," NCA director general Graeme Biggar told reporters in London. 

 

LockBit's website -- selling services that allow people to organize cyber attacks and hold data until a ransom is paid appears -- was taken over on Monday evening. 

 

A message appeared on the site stating that it was "now under control of law enforcement". 

 

"As of today LockBit is effectively redundant, LockBit has been locked out," Biggar said. 

 

The U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) said the agencies had seized control of "numerous public-facing websites used by LockBit to connect to the organization's infrastructure" and taken control of servers used by LockBit administrators. 

 

The NCA added that it had obtained more than 1,000 decryption keys and will be contacting UK-based victims in the coming days and weeks to offer support and help them recover encrypted data. 

 

Biggar said the network had been behind 25 percent of all cyber attacks in the past year. 

 

LockBit has targeted over 2,000 victims and received more than $120 million in ransom payments since it formed four years ago, according to the DOJ. 

 

Those targeted have included Britain's Royal Mail, US aircraft manufacturer Boeing, and a Canadian children's hospital. 

 

In January 2023, US law enforcers shut down the Hive ransomware operation which extorted some $100 million from more than 1,500 victims worldwide. 

 

Since then, LockBit has been seen as the biggest current threat. 

 

 

Hive and LockBit are part of what cybersecurity experts call a "ransomware as a service" style, or RaaS -- a business that leases its software and methods to others to use in extorting money. 

 

Ariel Ropek, director of cyber threat intelligence at cybersecurity firm Avertium, told AFP last year that this structure makes it possible for criminals with minimal computer fluency to get into ransomware by paying others for their expertise. 

 

On the so-called dark web, providers of ransomware services pitch their products openly. 

 

At one end are the initial access brokers, who specialise in breaking into corporate or institutional computer systems. 

 

They then sell that access to the hacker, or ransomware operator. 

 

But the operator depends on RaaS developers like Hive or LockBit, which have the programming skills to create the malware needed to carry out the operation. 

 

Typically, their programs -- once inserted by the ransomware operator into a target's IT systems -- are manipulated to freeze, via encryption, the target's files and data. 

 

RaaS developers offer a full service to the operators, for a large share of the ransom paid out, said Ropek. 

 

When the ransomware is planted and activated, the target receives a message telling them how much to pay to get their data unencrypted. 

 

That ransom can run from thousands to millions of dollars. 

 

On Tuesday, the U.S. unsealed an indictment against two Russian nationals, bringing to five the number of Russians it has charged in connection with LockBit. 

 

In a separate notice, the U.S. Treasury Department said it is imposing sanctions on the pair, affiliates of LockBit, who "actively engaged" in ransomware attacks. 

 

Biggar said a "large concentration" of the cyber criminals are in Russia and are Russian-speaking, but law enforcement agencies have not seen any direct support for LockBit from the Russian state. 

 

"There is clearly some tolerance of cyber criminality within Russia," he added.

## Wet Winter Storm Closes Airport, Prompts Rescues in California

date: 2024-02-20, from: VOA News USA

SAN FRANCISCO  — Another wet winter storm swamped California with heavy rainfall on Monday, flooding the runways at a regional airport and leading to several rescues on swollen rivers and creeks.


The Santa Barbara airport, on the state's central coast, closed Monday after as much as 25 centimeters of rain had fallen in the area by noon, covering the runways with water and closing the airport.


The National Weather Service had warned that California's central coast was at risk of "significant flooding," with up to 12 cm of rain predicted for many areas and isolated rain totals of 25 cm possible in the Santa Lucia and Santa Ynez mountain ranges as the storm headed toward greater Los Angeles.


The storm is expected to move through quicker than the devastating atmospheric river that parked itself over Southern California earlier this month, turning roads into rivers, causing hundreds of landslides and killing at least nine people.


Moderate showers were reported Monday afternoon, but more rain was expected to impact the state through the night and into Tuesday, forecasters said.


The storm has led to a number of rescues, including in San Luis Obispo County, where crews helped three people out of the rising Salinas River in the city of Paso Robles. Firefighters were getting ready to train on swift-water rescues when they received word that someone was stranded on an island in the river, Paso Robles Fire and Emergency Services Battalion Chief Scott Hallett told KSBY-TV.




Farther to the north, firefighters rescued two people from the top of their vehicle, which had stalled in flood waters in Sloughhouse, a community about 32 kilometers southeast of Sacramento, the Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District said.


Hours earlier, a man was rescued along a creek in El Dorado Hills, northeast of Sacramento. The man, who had been camping in the area, was trapped in a tree as floodwaters rose, El Dorado Hills Deputy Fire Chief Dave Brady told KCRA-TV.


Thunderstorms in valleys around the state capital on Monday could bring "brief tornadoes, large amounts of small hail, heavy rain, lightning, and gusty winds," the weather service in Sacramento warned on X.


Residents in the region, including Sacramento, Chico, Yuba City, Stockton and Modesto, "are advised to pay close attention to the weather," the office said later in a separate statement.




Kelly Curtis, a personal trainer in Long Beach, prepared by getting sandbags to protect her home.


"I don't think it will be as bad as the last storm, but last time I got flooded and I kept the sandbags just in case," she said.


Forecasters said the storm would be strong enough to cause problems including flash flooding and power outages. Flood watches and warnings were issued in coastal and mountain areas up and down the state.


Several feet of snow is possible at elevations above about 2,070 meters across the Sierra Nevada, the weather service said. Motorists were urged to avoid mountain routes.


"Consider completing Sierra travel during the day Sunday, or rescheduling to later next week," said the weather service office in Reno, Nevada. The office issued a backcountry avalanche watch for the greater Lake Tahoe area and the eastern Sierra in Inyo and Mono counties.


The California Governor's Office of Emergency Services activated its operations center Saturday and positioned personnel and equipment in areas most at risk.

## WikiLeaks' Assange Set to Begin Last-ditch Effort to Stop Extradition to US

date: 2024-02-20, from: VOA News USA

london — WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange begins what could be his last chance to stop his extradition from Britain to the United States on Tuesday after more than 13 years battling the authorities in the English courts. 


U.S. prosecutors are seeking to put Assange, 52, on trial on 18 counts relating to WikiLeaks' high-profile release of vast troves of confidential U.S. military records and diplomatic cables. 


They argue that the leaks imperiled the lives of their agents and that there is no excuse for his criminality. Assange's many supporters hail him as an anti-establishment hero and a journalist who is being persecuted for exposing U.S. wrongdoing. 


Assange's legal battles began in 2010, and he subsequently spent seven years holed up in Ecuador's embassy in London before he was dragged out and jailed in 2019 for breaching bail conditions. He has been held in a maximum-security jail in southeast London ever since, even getting married there. 


Britain finally approved his extradition to the U.S. in 2022 after a judge initially blocked it because concerns about his mental health meant he would be at risk of suicide if deported. 


His lawyers will try to overturn that approval at a two-day hearing in front of two judges at London's High Court in what could be his last chance to stop his extradition in the English courts. His wife, Stella, last week described it as a matter of life and death. 


They will argue that Assange's prosecution is politically motivated and marks an impermissible attack on free speech, as the first time a publisher has been charged under the U.S. Espionage Act. 


His supporters include Amnesty International, Reporters Without Borders, media organizations that worked with WikiLeaks, and Australian politicians, including Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who last week voted in favor of a motion calling for his return to Australia. 


Pope Francis even granted his wife an audience last year. 


'His life is at risk'


If Assange wins permission in the latest case, a full appeal hearing will be held to again consider his challenge. If he loses, his only remaining option would be at the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), where he has an appeal already lodged pending the London ruling. 


Speaking last week, Stella Assange said they would apply to the ECHR for an emergency injunction if necessary. She said her husband would not survive if he was extradited. 


"His health is in decline, physically and mentally," she said. "His life is at risk every single day he stays in prison – and if he is extradited, he will die." 


Assange's brother Gabriel Shipton compared the WikiLeaks founder with Alexey Navalny, the Russian opposition activist who died in prison Friday while serving a 19-year sentence. 


"I know exactly what it feels like to have a loved one unjustly incarcerated with no hope," he told the BBC. "To have them pass away, that's what we live in fear of: that Julian will be lost to us, lost to the U.S. prison system or even die in jail in the U.K." 


WikiLeaks first came to prominence in 2010 when it published a U.S. military video showing a 2007 attack by Apache helicopters in Baghdad that killed a dozen people, including two Reuters news staff. 


It then released thousands of secret classified files and diplomatic cables that laid bare often highly critical U.S. appraisals of world leaders from Russian President Vladimir Putin to members of the Saudi royal family.

## Fully documented source code for Lander on the Acorn Archimedes

date: 2024-02-19, from: OS News

This site contains reconstructed source code for Lander, David Braben&#8217;s epic game for the Acorn Archimedes, with every single line documented and (for the most part) explained. Lander was the very first game to be released for the ARM processor, and it is both a milestone and a masterpiece. My hope is that this site will be useful for those who want to learn more about Lander and what makes it tick. It is provided on an educational and non-profit basis, with the aim of helping people appreciate the second classic game from this legend of 3D coding (the first classic being Elite, of course). ↫ Mark Moxon An incredibly valuable resource.

date: 2024-02-19, from: VOA News USA

state department — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken heads to Brazil and Argentina on Tuesday morning to hold talks and foster rapport with the independent-minded leaders from the two countries while also attending the Group of 20 foreign ministers’ meetings in Rio de Janeiro.


With Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also expected at the G20 meetings, there’s potential for a rare face-to-face interaction between the two.


Blinken’s visits to Brazil and Argentina will be his first as the top U.S. diplomat.


Blinken will meet with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in Brasilia and the newly inaugurated Argentine President Javier Milei in Buenos Aires to discuss bilateral and global issues.


The State Department said Blinken will emphasize U.S. support for Brazil’s G20 presidency, the U.S.-Brazil Partnership for Workers Rights, cooperation on the clean energy transition and commemorations for the bicentennial of diplomatic relations between the two countries.


Blinken also plans to discuss the Multinational Security Support Mission in Haiti with G20 partners on the sidelines of the meetings, addressing the Haitian people’s call for help to restore security and stability.


Argentina boasts one of the largest Jewish populations in South America. Following Milei's recent visit to Israel, a senior U.S. official said Blinken will engage in discussions with Milei regarding “the way forward between Israel and Gaza.” Other topics high on the agenda include critical minerals and sustainable economic growth.


No G20 joint statement expected on Gaza, Ukraine


The G20, comprising 19 countries including the G7, the European Union and the African Union, represents about 85% of global GDP, 75% of global trade and two-thirds of the global population.


The G7 comprises the world's richest and most powerful countries.


Last week, G7 foreign ministers expressed outrage over the detention death of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny and pledged unwavering support to Ukraine as the two-year mark of Russia’s invasion approaches.


The G7 foreign ministers’ joint statement also advocated for “prolonged and durable pauses in the hostilities leading to a sustainable cease-fire” in Gaza while expressing “deep concern” over the “devastating” impact of Israel’s planned military operations in Rafah, where more than a million civilians are taking refuge.


Ramin Toloui, assistant secretary of state for economic and business affairs, said the U.S. will underscore the damage caused by the “Kremlin’s war of aggression” and “encourage all G20 partners to redouble their calls for a just, peaceful and lasting end” to the war on Ukraine.


But Toloui said Brazil would not “attempt to mobilize a joint statement” during the upcoming G20 foreign ministers’ meetings.


Distinct foreign relations


Blinken's diplomatic missions to Argentina and Brazil will navigate the countries' distinct foreign relations concerning various countries and issues, such as Russia, Gaza and China.


Lula initially assured that Russian President Vladimir Putin, who faces an International Criminal Court arrest warrant, would not be arrested if he attended the G20 summit in November in Brazil. However, he later amended his stance, indicating that the decision would ultimately be in the hands of Brazil's judiciary.


During his visit to Cairo, February 14 and 15, Lula strongly criticized Israel's military actions in Gaza, advocating for a "definitive cease-fire." He announced Brazil's new contribution to the United Nations’ Palestinian refugee agency, or UNRWA, and supported Palestine's recognition as a sovereign state with full U.N. membership.


Lula wrote on the social media platform X, “While Hamas militants' attack on October 7 against Israeli civilians is indefensible and deserved strong condemnation from Brazil, Israel's disproportionate and indiscriminate response is unacceptable."


In contrast, during his visit to Israel in early February, Milei, a pro-Israel far-right leader, announced his intention to relocate Argentina's embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a move previously made by only the United States and a few other countries.


Milei also announced his government's intention to classify Hamas as a terrorist organization.


This visit marked his first bilateral trip since his inauguration in December.




Following his meeting with Blinken on Friday, Milei plans to visit Washington and speak at the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, on February 24, a gathering expected to be filled with supporters of former U.S. President Donald Trump.



BRICS and China


In 2025, Brazil will lead the BRICS group (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) of emerging nations, in which China is a key player. During a state visit to Beijing last year, Lula called for BRICS countries to trade in their own currencies and end the U.S. dollar’s trade dominance. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates officially joined the bloc on January 1.


Last month, Lula held talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in which the two pledged to strengthen a comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries.


In comparison, Milei has turned down an offer to join BRICS. During his presidential campaign, he said he would freeze relations with China.


Milei also chose to acquire secondhand American F-16 fighters from Denmark, favoring them over new Chinese JF-17 fighter aircraft.


“The United States is the largest source of foreign direct investment in Brazil, and we have a robust presence of U.S. companies in Brazil, as well as in Argentina, and we’re looking forward to deepening our economic ties between both of them,” Brian Nichols, the assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, told VOA in a recent phone briefing.


Nichols emphasized the importance of countries trading freely while understanding the trade-offs involved.


“The United States is offering up a comprehensive and powerful alternative to those who may not necessarily have others’ best interests at heart,” he said.

With Turkey-U.S. relations improving rapidly, Washington offered to allow Ankara to buy its advanced F-35 military jet if it removes to a third country the S-400 missiles it purchased from Russia. But as Dorian Jones reports from Istanbul, the missiles remain a potent symbol of deepening Turkish-Russian ties.

## US-China Rivalry Expands to Biotech; Lawmakers Raise Alarm

date: 2024-02-19, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON  — U.S. lawmakers are raising alarms about what they see as America's failure to compete with China in biotechnology, warning of the risks to U.S. national security and commercial interests. But as the two countries' rivalry expands into the biotech industry, some say that shutting out Chinese companies would only hurt the U.S.


Biotechnology promises to revolutionize everyday life, with scientists and researchers using it to make rapid advances in medical treatment, genetic engineering in agriculture and novel biomaterials. Because of its potential, it has caught the attention of both the Chinese and U.S. governments.


Bills have been introduced in the House and Senate to bar "foreign adversary biotech companies of concern" from doing business with federally funded medical providers. The bills name four Chinese-owned companies.


The Chinese Embassy said those behind the bills have an "ideological bias" and seek to suppress Chinese companies "under false pretexts." It demanded that Chinese companies be given "open, just, and non-discriminatory treatment."


The debate over biotechnology is taking place as the Biden administration tries to stabilize the volatile U.S.-China relationship, which has been battered by a range of issues, including a trade war, the COVID-19 pandemic, cybersecurity and militarization in the South China Sea.


Critics of the legislation warn that restrictions on Chinese companies would impede advances that could bring a greater good.


"In biotech, one cannot maintain competitiveness by walling off others," said Abigail Coplin, an assistant professor at Vassar College who specializes in China's biotech industry. She said she was worried that U.S. policymakers would get too obsessed with the technology's military applications at the cost of hindering efforts to cure disease and feed the world's population.


In a letter to senators sponsoring the bill, Rachel King, chief executive officer of the trade association Biotechnology Innovation Organization, said the legislation would "do untold damage to the drug development supply chain both for treatments currently approved and on market as well as for development pipelines decades in the making."


But supporters say the legislation is crucial to protecting U.S. interests.


The National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology, a group created by the U.S. Senate to review the industry, said the bill would help secure the data of the federal government and of American citizens and it would discourage unfair competition from Chinese companies.


The commission warned that advancement in biotechnology can result not only in economic benefits but also rapid changes in military capabilities.


Much is at stake, said Rep. Mike Gallagher, chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party. Gallagher introduced the House version of the bill and last week led a congressional delegation to Boston to meet with biotech executives.




"It's not just a supply chain battle or a national security battle or an economic security battle; I would submit it's a moral and ethical battle," Gallagher said. "Just as the sector advances at a really astronomic pace, the country who wins the race will set the ethical standards around how these technologies are used."


He argues that the U.S. must "set the rules of the road" and if not, "we're going to live in a less free, less moral world as a result."


Both the United States and China, the world's two largest economies, have identified biotech as a critical national interest.


The Biden administration has put forward a "whole-of-government approach" to advance biotechnology and biomanufacturing that is important for health, climate change, energy, food security, agriculture and supply chain resilience.


The Chinese government has plans to develop a "national strategic technology force" in biotech, which would be tasked with making breakthroughs and helping China achieve "technological independence," primarily from the U.S.


"Both the Chinese government and the Americans have identified biotech as an area important for investment, a sector that presents an opportunity to grow their economy," said Tom Bollyky, the Bloomberg chair in global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. He said any restrictive U.S. measures should be tailored to address military concerns and concerns about genomic data security.


"Naturally there's going to be competition, but what's challenging in biotech is that we are talking about human health," Bollyky said.


Ray Yip, who founded the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention office in China, also worries that the rivalry will slow medical advancements.


The benefit of coming up with better diagnostics and therapy is beyond any individual country, Yip said, "and will not overshadow the capacity or prestige of the other country."


What concerns Anna Puglisi, a senior fellow at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology, is Beijing's lack of transparency and its unfair market practices. "Competition is one thing. Unfair competition is another thing," she said.


Puglisi described BGI, a major Chinese biotech company identified in both the House and Senate bills, as "a national champion" that is subsidized and given favored treatment by the state in a system that "blurs private and public as well as civilian and military."


"This system creates market distortions and undermines the global norms of science by using researchers and academic and commercial entities to further the goals of the state," Puglisi said.


BGI, which has stressed its private ownership, offers genetic testing kits and a popular prenatal screening test to detect Down syndrome and other conditions. U.S. lawmakers say they are concerned such data could end up in the hands of the Chinese government.


The Defense Department has listed BGI as a Chinese military company, and the Commerce Department has blacklisted it on human rights grounds, citing a risk that BGI technology might have contributed to surveillance. BGI has rejected the allegations.


In raising its concerns about BGI, the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology says the company is required to share data with the Chinese government, has partnered with the Chinese military, and has received considerable Chinese state funding and support.


State subsidies have allowed BGI to offer genomic sequencing services at a highly competitive price that is attractive to U.S. researchers, according to the commission. The genomic data, once in the hands of the Chinese government, "represents a strategic asset that has privacy, security, economic, and ethical implications," it said.


BGI could not immediately be reached for comment.

## Reunited with Vision Pro

date: 2024-02-19, from: Om Malik blog

Your body has a weird way of reminding you of your “age.” For me, that reminder came in the form of jetlag. There was a time when&#160;my jet lag would be gone&#160;in&#160;a day&#160;when I would fly back from Delhi,&#160;but this&#160;time it has taken three days to bounce back and adjust to California&#160;time. No harm was &#8230;

That's what it's going to take -- we have to capture the imaginations of the smartest web writers.

## EU Court of Human Rights Rejects Encryption Backdoors

date: 2024-02-19, updated: 2024-02-19, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>The European Court of Human Rights has <a href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng/#{%22itemid%22:[%22001-230854%22]}">ruled</a> that breaking end-to-end encryption by adding backdoors <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/human-rights-court-takes-stand-against-weakening-of-end-to-end-encryption/">violates human rights</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Seemingly most critically, the [Russian] government told the ECHR that any intrusion on private lives resulting from decrypting messages was &#8220;necessary&#8221; to combat terrorism in a democratic society. To back up this claim, the government pointed to a 2017 terrorist attack that was &#8220;coordinated from abroad through secret chats via Telegram.&#8221; The government claimed that a second terrorist attack that year was prevented after the government discovered it was being coordinated through Telegram chats...</p></blockquote>

## Abortion Rights Could Complicate Republican Larry Hogan's US Senate Bid

date: 2024-02-19, from: VOA News USA

Annapolis, Maryland — Republicans hoping to pick up an open U.S. Senate seat in deep blue Maryland have the most competitive candidate they've fielded for decades. But former Gov. Larry Hogan will need more than GOP support to overcome sustained outrage about the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to strike down constitutional protections for abortion.


With Maryland voters set to decide whether to enshrine the right to abortion in the state constitution in November, it may be harder for Hogan to reassemble the bipartisan coalition that elected him to the governor's office in 2014 and kept him there four years later.


His task was laid out vividly by Lynn Johnson Langer, a Democrat walking to lunch in downtown Annapolis several days after Hogan announced his Senate bid. Hogan is likable enough to have won her vote in his second campaign for governor, but the stakes are too high for her to support handing Republicans another win in a closely divided Senate.


“We need more Democrats, so, sorry Hogan,” Langer said. ”I don’t think he’s a bad guy. Like I said, I don’t always agree with him. In fact, a lot I don’t agree with him.”


Hogan's decision to veto legislation to expand abortion access in Maryland in 2022 lingers with voters like Langer. She supports abortion rights unequivocally and said she probably will back a candidate who doesn't hedge.


Hogan has said he does not support taking abortion rights away, even though he personally opposes abortion. However, as governor, he vetoed legislation to end a restriction that only physicians provide abortions. When his veto was overridden by Democrats who control the Legislature, he used the power of his office to block funding set aside to support training non-physicians to perform them.


Abortion already is protected in Maryland law, but Democrats who control the Legislature voted last year to put a state constitutional amendment before voters. In doing so they were following a proven political formula used successfully by several states in the aftermath of the Supreme Court decision.


“This is an issue the Democrats care about, and this is a big thing about Maryland: It doesn’t matter how popular you are with your base, and it doesn’t matter how popular you are among independents, the path to the Senate in Maryland goes through the Democratic Party,” said Mileah Kromer, an associate professor of political science at Goucher College, who has written a book about Hogan. “You need Democratic votes to win, and that’s just the math of the state.”


Hogan attracted national attention during his tenure as governor as one of the rare Republicans willing to criticize Donald Trump, who appointed three conservative justices that created the Supreme Court's conservative majority that voted to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022. Now, Hogan could be on the same ballot as the former president, who is favored to win the Republican nomination but is deeply unpopular in Maryland.


Mary Kfoury, a Democrat who lives in Edgewater, Maryland, praised Hogan for speaking out against Trump, though that's not enough to get her vote.


“I really don’t think we can afford to have a Republican," Kfoury said. "I want to keep Maryland as blue as possible, especially with things as close as they are, but I think if we had to have a Republican in the Senate he would be a terrific person to have, because he truly states what he thinks and he’s for more traditional Republican values and has bravely spoken against Trump.”


Hogan focused his governorship on pocketbook concerns, largely avoiding social issues and maintaining civility with the Legislature. In a video announcing his candidacy, he highlighted that aspect of his tenure.


“For eight years, we proved that the toxic politics that divide our nation need not divide our state," Hogan said. “We overcame unprecedented challenges, cut taxes eight years in a row, balanced the budget, and created a record surplus. And we did it all by finding common ground for the common good.”


While Kromer describes Hogan's Senate candidacy as “an uphill battle,” she said it would be wrong to dismiss a candidate who consistently maintained high approval ratings during his eight years as governor, despite the 2-1 advantage Democrats hold over Republicans in the state.


“For me, it’s not just that Hogan was popular, it was that Hogan was persistently popular for eight years," said Kromer, who wrote “Blue State Republican: How Larry Hogan Won Where Republicans Lose and Lessons for a Future GOP.”


Democrats running to succeed retiring Sen. Ben Cardin pounced on concerns about abortion rights, after Hogan announced his surprise Senate bid just hours before the state's filing deadline.


“We know what’s at stake in this election — our fundamental freedoms over our bodies,” said Angela Alsobrooks, the chief executive in Prince George's County, the state's second-largest jurisdiction in the suburbs of the nation's capital.


Alsobrooks, who could make history as Maryland's first Black U.S. senator, is running in the Democratic primary against U.S. Rep David Trone, the wealthy founder of Total Wine and More who has invested more than $23 million in his own campaign.


Hogan, speaking publicly for the first time since announcing his candidacy last week, told CNN on Wednesday that “I would not vote to support a national abortion ban."


He also said that while he understands “why this is such an important and emotional issue for women across Maryland and across the country,” he doesn't believe the constitutional amendment in Maryland is necessary, because abortion rights already are protected in state law.


The state approved legislation in 1991 to protect abortion rights if the Supreme Court were to allow abortion to be restricted. Voters showed their support for the law the following year, when 62% backed it in a referendum.


“I think Democrats put this on the ballot to try to make it a political issue, and voters can make their decision on whether they think it’s important or not, but it’s not going to change anything in our state,” Hogan told CNN.


Alsobrooks said Hogan's comments echoed years of Republican rhetoric asserting that public policy on abortion had been “settled law.”


“That’s what they told us right up until the day they overturned Roe v. Wade and took away a 50-year precedent that had protected our rights," Alsobrooks said in a statement.


The Maryland legislation approved in 2022 to expand abortion access was passed after supporters contended the measure was needed because the state didn't have enough providers. They also said the state needed to be prepared to respond to a growing number of women coming to Maryland for abortions after bans in other states.


After his veto was overridden, Hogan, who is Catholic, refused to release $3.5 million in the state budget to help fund training. One of Democratic Gov. Wes Moore's first actions as governor last year was to release the money that Hogan had withheld.


Hogan entered a GOP primary with seven other candidates, none as well known politically as the former governor. One of the candidates, Robin Ficker, garnered national attention years ago as an acid-tongued sports heckler at basketball games for Washington's NBA team when it played in Landover, Maryland.


A Republican has not won a U.S. Senate election in Maryland since 1980.

<a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/293">Random thought</a> -- maybe the fastest way to get full ActivityPub support for WordPress is to offer a feature in any WP site to cross-post to a Mastodon gateway operated by Automattic. It's possible I don't understand the problem of course. But Mastodon is open source, so it's not like depending on another vendor to do this for you. And then you avoid all the hassles with having to say what part of the protocol is ActivityPub and what part is Mastodon's API.

## Minnesota Community Mourns 2 Officers, 1 Firefighter Killed at the Scene of Domestic Call

date: 2024-02-19, from: VOA News USA

BURNSVILLE, Minn. — A suburban Minneapolis community was in mourning on Monday after authorities said two police officers and a firefighter were killed by a heavily armed man who shot at them from inside a home that was filled with children.


The shooting on Sunday in a tree-lined neighborhood of Burnsville, Minnesota, left a third officer wounded. The suspect, who officials said had multiple guns and large amounts of ammunition, also died.


Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans said there was an exchange of gunfire, and authorities were still piecing together details of what he described as a “terrible day.”


The firefighter, who also works as a paramedic, was shot while providing aid to an injured officer, Evans said. He told reporters the paramedic was a part of a SWAT team that had been called to a domestic situation at the home. 


Inside, an armed man had barricaded himself with his family, including seven children ranging in age from 2 to 15, Evans said.


He said negotiations lasted for hours before the suspect opened fire. He wasn’t specific on the exact amount of time, but the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association said the standoff lasted four hours before a SWAT team entered the home.


Evans said the suspect had several guns and large amounts of ammunition and shot at the police officers from multiple positions within the home, including the upper and lower floors. Evans said at least one officer was shot inside the home.


“We still don’t know the exact exchange of gunfire that occurred,” Evans said. “Certainly several officers did return fire.”


He said that around 8 a.m. the suspect was found dead and the family and children were released from the home. None of them were hurt.




City officials identified the slain officers as Paul Elmstrand and Matthew Ruge, both 27. Adam Finseth, 40, a firefighter and paramedic for the city since 2019, also was killed.


Elmstrand, a member of the department’s mobile command staff, joined the department in 2017. Ruge was hired in 2020 and was part of the department’s crisis negotiations team and was a physical evidence officer.


Another police officer, Sgt. Adam Medlicott, was injured and being treated at a hospital with what are believed to be non-life-threatening injuries, the city said.


As the bodies of the dead left a hospital, officers saluted, before they were taken in a convoy to the medical examiner’s office. Medical staff watched in scrubs.


“We’re hurting,” said Police Chief Tanya Schwartz. “Today, three members of our team made the ultimate sacrifice for this community. They are heroes.” 


Neighbors were startled awake by loud pops about an hour before sunrise.


Alicia McCullum said she and her family dropped to the floor, uncertain whether the noise was gunshots. She and her husband peered out of their sunroom and saw squad cars and a phalanx of police officers.


“I didn’t think it was a gunshot at first, but then we opened the windows and we saw police everywhere and police hiding in our neighbors’ yards,” said McCullum, who lives two houses down from the source of the commotion.


“Then there were three more gunshots,” she said. “It was like a bunch of fireworks.” That’s when she and her husband and two children sought safety in a bathroom and dropped to the floor. They prayed.


McCullum said she was relieved to see a woman and children escorted out of their home. “We’re so thankful for those police officers that risked their lives to save those kids,” McCullum said. “And my heart goes out to that mother.”


Fire Chief BJ Jungmann said the community was grieving and asked for privacy for the families. None of the relatives of the officers or the firefighter immediately returned phone messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.


Evans said the medical examiner would identify the suspect and said autopsies were planned for Monday. There was no indication the home had been a source of troubles in the past.


“There have not been many calls for service at all,” Evans said.


As the investigation unfolded, the neighborhood was ringed with police cars to keep reporters and the public away. A police armored vehicle had bullet damage to its windshield, and Evans confirmed it sustained the damage in the gunfight.


Police scanner recordings on Broadcastify.com capture a rattled man saying, “I need any ambulance,” as he struggled to catch his breath. Someone later could be heard talking about three being loaded into ambulances, uttering the word “critical.”


As news spread, other law enforcement agencies immediately began posting messages of condolence on social media, including images of badges with blue bars through them. It is a mark of solidarity in mourning.


“In times like these, it is essential to come together as a community and support one another through the uncertainty and grief,” said Marty Kelly, the sheriff in neighboring Goodhue County.


Flags also were lowered to half-staff, with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz urging those who walked past them to take a moment and think about the first responders who lost their lives.


“Minnesota mourns with you,” he said. “The state stands ready to assist in any way possible.”


Hundreds of people gathered in front of Burnsville City Hall on Sunday night for a candlelit vigil to remember the victims. Several uniformed officers from other departments also attended.


A fire truck and police car were in front of the building. The police vehicle had bouquets of flowers on the hood and handwritten signs tucked under the windshield wipers, one of which read: “We are praying for you.” Those gathered joined together in prayer and sang “Amazing Grace.”


“Right now is a time to grieve, to come together and grieve our community’s loss, and to support the families,” said U.S. Rep. Angie Craig.


“I can’t imagine the pain that you’re all going through,” Craig continued, “but what I can say is that to all our officers out there, the paramedics, our firefighters, thank you for what you do.” The crowd applauded.


“It’s an important community,” said area resident Kris Martin, “and we feel very saddened by what happened.”


Burnsville, a city of around 64,000, is located about 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of downtown Minneapolis.

## Miami Expects Trophies From Messi's First Full Season in Major League Soccer

date: 2024-02-19, from: VOA News USA

Miami, Florida — Lionel Messi and Inter Miami get the new Major League Soccer season under way on Wednesday with pressure on the Argentine star to deliver trophies for his club and more eyeballs on the league.


The World Cup winner joined Inter from Paris Saint Germain in mid-July, the biggest name ever to move to MLS and his signing caused a massive spurt in interest in American soccer.


The eight-times and current Ballon d'Or winner, made an instant impact, leading Miami to the Leagues Cup title, packing stadiums and massively increasing subscriptions to Apple TV's MLS Season Pass broadcast package.


But the excitement waned as the 36-year-old struggled to maintain his fitness in the face of a hectic schedule and Miami were unable to overcome their poor early season results and make the playoffs.


Then Inter's decision to undertake a grueling overseas pre-season tour backfired with Messi and the team booed in Hong Kong after the star sat out a high-profile friendly due to injury.


Poor performances added to the sense that money-spinning trips to El Salvador, Saudi Arabia and Japan had been a mis-step for a team looking to hit the ground running this season.


A long and busy season awaits for Messi and his team-mates who as well as competing in MLS, have qualified for the regional CONCACAF Champions Cup.


Miami will also aim to defend their Leagues Cup title — against Mexican as well as MLS opposition — and all those challenges come in a summer which will include Argentina's bid for the Copa America in the USA.


Messi has been joined in Miami by another veteran striker in Uruguayan Luis Suarez, making up a quartet of former Barcelona players with midfielder Sergio Busquets and left-back Jordi Alba.


Coping with expectation


No MLS team has ever been able to draw on players of such pedigree and experience and with that comes the expectation that they will land the club's first MLS title.


Messi is well used to such pressure but it is a new sensation for some of the younger players in Gerardo Martino's squad.


Shanyder Borgelin, the 22-year-old striker who scored in last week's home friendly against Argentine club Newells Old Boys, says the team can cope with the high expectations.


"That's expected when you have the greatest player in the world, four of the greatest players in the world, but I think we're ready," he told the Miami Herald.


"We are all called up to a big task. I definitely think the [preseason] losses and everything that comes with that made us a lot stronger," he added.


Miami kick-off their campaign on Wednesday at home to Real Salt Lake with the rest of the league getting under way on Saturday.


Defending champions Columbus Crew start their title defense at home to Atlanta United with their French coach Wilfried Nancy looking to maintain the momentum of a playoff campaign which ended in victory over Los Angles FC.


LAFC, the 2022 MLS Cup winners, host Western Conference rivals the Seattle Sounders in the biggest clash of the opening weekend.


LAFC have lost four regular starters from last season's team including Italian Giorgio Chiellini, who has retired.


But Steve Cherundolo's side have added a World Cup winner of their own with France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris joining from Tottenham Hotspur.


Top-scorer Denis Bouanga remains with the club despite reports he could head back to France but the future of the team's talismanic Mexican forward Carlos Vela remains unclear.


The 34-year-old Vela is a free agent after his contract with the club was not yet renewed.


There are some new faces on the bench with former Aston Villa manager Dean Smith taking charge at Charlotte and Phil Neville, the former Manchester United player and ex-Inter Miami boss now at the Portland Timbers.


The opening games are set to be officiated by replacement referees after talks over a new collective deal between the refs union and the league's Professional Referees.

## I look forward to dumping Trump again

I read today in the NYT that the resistance <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/19/us/politics/trump-resistance-democrats-voters.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Wk0.0hoY.duTfLtk_PUxj&smid=url-share">is exhausted</a>. Bullshit. We're very well rested. Anyway I look forward to once again, pretending Trump doesn't exist, next year or the year after, Murphy-willing. </p>
<p>The other day when I was skiing at <a href="https://www.belleayre.com/">Belleayre</a>, I got to ride up on a chairlift with a Trump supporter. He told me he got Covid but it wasn't a big deal, just like a cold. I said a lot of people died from Covid. He said most were already sick or overweight. I said yeah but they deserve to live too. He said he didn't get vaccinated, he doesn't like to put drugs in his body. What bullshit I muttered under my breath. I looked at him, maybe ten years younger than me. From New Jersey, a house painter. I said that my life has been saved by drugs at least twice, once when I was perfectly healthy other than having a ruptured appendix at 9 years old. I also said you're really lucky not to have needed medical care, but before you die I bet you will. And I thought to myself but didn't say out loud that what about your parents and grandparents, siblings even children? Have they all been perfectly healthy until they died? Anyway a chairlift is not a safe place for real anger, but -- you also can't walk away from the other person. There's a lot of soul-sharing on rides like that.  </p>

## Pluralistic: Middlemen without enshittification; The Bezzle excerpt (Part II) (19 Feb 2024)

date: 2024-02-19, from: Cory Doctorow's blog

Today's links Middlemen without enshittification: Not every author can be a DIY author. The Bezzle excerpt (Part II): Let's learn about copyright termination! Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading Middlemen without enshittification (permalink) Enshittification describes how platforms go bad, which is also how the internet goes bad, because the internet is made of platforms, which is weird, because platforms are intermediaries and we were promised that the internet would disintermediate the world: https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/30/go-nuts-meine-kerle/#ich-bin-ein-bratapfel The internet did disintermediate a hell of a lot of intermediaries &#8211; that is, "middlemen" &#8211; but then it created a bunch more of these middlemen, who coalesced into a handful of gatekeepers, or as the EU calls them "VLOPs" (Very Large Online Platforms, the most EU acronym ever). Which raises two questions: first, why did so many of us end up flocking to these intermediaries' sites, and how did those sites end up with so much power? To answer the first question, I want you to consider one of my favorite authors: Crad Kilodney (RIP): https://archive.org/details/thecradkilodneypapers When I was growing up, Crad was a fixture on the streets of Toronto. All through the day and late into the evening, winter or summer, Crad would stand on the street with a sign around his neck ("Very famous Canadian author, buy my books, $2" or sometimes just "Margaret Atwood, buy my books, $2"). He wrote these deeply weird, often very funny short stories, which he edited, typeset, printed, bound and sold himself, one at a time, to people who approached him on the street. I had a lot of conversations with Crad &#8211; as an aspiring writer, I was endlessly fascinated by him and his books. He was funny, acerbic &#8211; and sneaky. Crad wore a wire: he kept a hidden tape recorder rolling in his coat and he secretly recorded conversations with people like me, and then released a series of home-duplicated tapes of the weirdest and funniest ones: https://archive.org/details/on-the-street-crad-kilodney-vol-1 I love Crad. He deserves more recognition. There's an on-again/off-again documentary about his life and work that I hope gets made some day: https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/09/free-sample/#putrid-scum But &#8211; and this is the crucial part &#8211; there are writers out there I want to hear from who couldn't do what Crad did. Maybe they can write books, but not edit them. Or edit them, but not typeset them. Or typeset, but not print. Or print, but not spend the rest of their lives standing on a street-corner with a "PUTRID SCUM" sign around their neck. Which is fine. That's why we have intermediaries. I like booksellers (I was one!). I like publishers. I like distributors. I like their salesforce, who go forth and convince the booksellers of the world to stock books like mine. I have ten million things I want to do before I die, and I'm already 52, and being a sales-rep for a publisher isn't on my bucket list. I am so thankful that someone else wants to do this for me. That's why we have intermediaries, and why disintermediation always leads to some degree of re-intermediation. There's a lot of explicit and implicit knowledge and specialized skill required to connect buyers and sellers, creators and audiences, and other sides of two-sided markets. Some producers can do some of this stuff for themselves, and a very few &#8211; like Crad &#8211; can do it all, but most of us need some help, somewhere along the way. In the excellent 2022 book Direct, Kathryn Judge lays out a clear case for all the good that middlemen can do: https://pluralistic.net/2022/06/12/direct-the-problem-of-middlemen/ So why were we all so anxious for disintermediation back in the late 1990s? Here's a hint: it wasn't because we hated intermediaries &#8211; it was because we hated powerful intermediaries. The point of an intermediary is to serve as a conduit between producers and consumers, buyers and sellers, audiences and creators. When an intermediary gains power over the audience &#8211; say, by locking them inside a walled garden &#8211; and then uses that lock-in to screw producers and appropriate an ever larger share of the value going between them, that's when intermediaries become a problem. The problem isn't that someone will handle ticketing for your gig. The problem is that Ticketmaster has locked down all the ticketing, and the venues, and the promotions, and it uses that power to gouge fans and rip off artists: https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/20/anything-that-cant-go-on-forever-will-eventually-stop/ The problem isn't that there's a well-made website that lets you shop for goods sold by many small merchants and producers. It's that Amazon has cornered this market, takes $0.51 out of every dollar you spend there, and clones and destroys any small merchant who succeeds on the platform: https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/25/greedflation/#commissar-bezos The problem isn't that there's a website where you can stream most of the music ever recorded. It's that Spotify colludes with the Big Three labels to rip off artists and sneaks crap you don't want to hear into your stream in order to collect payola: https://pluralistic.net/2022/09/12/streaming-doesnt-pay/#stunt-publishing The problem isn't that there's a website where you can buy any audiobook you want. It's that Amazon's Audible locks every book to its platform forever and steals hundreds of millions of dollars from creators: https://pluralistic.net/2022/07/25/can-you-hear-me-now/#acx-ripoff The problem, in other words, isn't intermediation &#8211; it's power. The thing that distinguishes a useful intermediary from an enshittified bully is power. Intermediaries gain power when our governments stop enforcing competition law. This lets intermediaries buy each other up and corner markets. Once they've formed cozy cartels, they can capture their regulators and commit rampant labor, privacy and consumer violations with impunity. That capture also lets them harness governments to punish smaller players that want to free workers, creators, audiences and customers from walled gardens. It also hands them a whip-hand over their workers, so that any worker who refuses to aid in these nefarious plans can be easily fired: https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/30/go-nuts-meine-kerle/#ich-bin-ein-bratapfel A world with intermediaries is a better world. As much as I love Crad Kilodney's books, I wouldn't want to live in a world where the only books on my shelves came from people prepared to stand on a street-corner wearing a "FOUL PUS FROM DEAD DOGS" sign. The problem isn't intermediaries &#8211; it's powerful intermediaries. That's why the world's surging antitrust movement is so exciting: by reinstating competition law, we can keep intermediaries small and comparatively weak, so that creators and audiences, drivers and riders, sellers and buyers, and other groups seeking to connect will not find themselves made subservient to middlemen. The Bezzle excerpt (Part II) (permalink) Today, I'm bringing you part two of this week's serialized excerpt from The Bezzle, my new Martin Hench high-tech crime revenge thriller: https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865878/thebezzle Though most of the scams that Hench &#8211; a two-fisted forensic accountant specializing in Silicon Valley skullduggery &#8211; goes after in The Bezzle have a strong tech component, this excerpt concerns a pre-digital scam: music royalty theft. This is a subject that I got really deep into when researching and writing 2022's Chokepoint Capitalism &#8211; a manifesto for fixing creative labor markets: https://chokepointcapitalism.com/ My co-author on that book is Rebecca Giblin, who also happens to be one of the world's leading experts in "copyright termination" &#8211; the legal right of creative workers to claw back any rights they signed over after 35 years: https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/26/take-it-back/ This was enshrined in the 1976 Copyright Act, and has largely languished in obscurity since then, though recent years have seen creators of all kinds getting their rights back through termination &#8211; the authors of The Babysitters Club and Sweet Valley High Books, Stephen King, and George Clinton, to name a few. The estates of the core team at Marvel Comics, including Stan Lee, just settled a case that might have let them take the rights to all those characters back from Disney: https://www.thewrap.com/marvel-settles-spiderman-lawsuit-steve-ditko/ Copyright termination is a powerful tonic to the bargaining disparities between creative workers. A creative worker who signs a bad contract at the start of their career can &#8211; if they choose &#8211; tear that contract up 35 years later and demand a better one. Turning this into a plot-point in The Bezzle is the kind of thing that I love about this series &#8211; the ability to take important, obscure, technical aspects of how the world works and turn them into high-stakes technothriller storylines that bring them to the audience they deserve. If you signed something away 35 years ago and you want to get it back, try Rights Back, an automated termination of tranfer tool co-developed by Creative Commons and Authors Alliance (whose advisory board I volunteer on): https://rightsback.org/ All right, onto today's installment. Here's part one, published on Saturday: https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/17/the-steve-soul-caper/#lead-singer-disease * * * It was on one of those drives where Stefon learned about copyright termination. It was 2011, and NPR was doing a story on the 1976 Copyright Act, passed the same year that was on the bottom of the document Chuy forged. Under the ’76 act, artists acquired a “termination right”—­ that is, the power to cancel any copyright assignment after thirty-­five years, even if they signed a contract promising to sign away their rights forever and a day (or until the copyright ran out, which was nearly the same thing). Listening to a smart, assured lady law professor from UC Berkeley explaining how this termination thing worked, Stefon got a wild idea. He pulled over and found a stub of a pencil and the back of a parking-­ticket envelope and wrote down the professor’s name when it was repeated at the end of the program. The next day he went to the Inglewood Public Library and got a reference librarian to teach him how to look up a UC Berkeley email address and he sent an email to the professor asking how he could terminate his copyright assignment. He was pretty sure she wasn’t going to answer him, but she did, in less than a day. He got the email on his son’s smartphone and the boy helped him send a reply asking if he could call her. One thing led to another and two weeks later, he’d filed the paperwork with the U.S. Copyright Office, along with a check for one hundred dollars. Time passed, and Stefon mostly forgot about his paperwork adventure with the Copyright Office, though every now and again he’d remember, think about that hundred dollars, and shake his head. Then, nearly a year later, there it was, in his mailbox: a letter saying that his copyright assignment had been canceled and his copyrights were his again. There was also a copy of a letter that had been sent to Chuy, explaining the same thing. Stefon knew a lawyer—­well, almost a lawyer, an ex–­trumpet player who became a paralegal after one time subbing for Sly Stone’s usual guy, and then never getting another gig that good. He invited Jamal over for dinner and cooked his best pot roast and served it with good whiskey and then Jamal agreed to send a letter to Inglewood Jams, informing them that Chuy no longer controlled his copyrights and they had to deal with him direct from now on. Stefon hand-­delivered the letter the next day, wearing his good suit for reasons he couldn’t explain. The receptionist took it without a blink. He waited. “Thank you,” she said, pointedly, glancing at the door. “I can wait,” he said. “For what?” She reminded him of his boy’s girlfriend, a sophomore a year younger than him. Both women projected a fierce message that they were done with everyone’s shit, especially shit from men, especially old men. He chose his words carefully. “I don’t know, honestly.” He smiled shyly. He was a good-­looking man, still. That smile had once beamed out of televisions all over America, from the Soul Train stage. “But ma’am, begging your pardon, that letter is about my music, which you all sell here. You sell a lot of it, and I want to talk that over with whoever is in charge of that business.” She let down her guard by one minute increment. “You’ll want Mr. Gounder,” she said. “He’s not in today. Give me your phone number, I’ll have him call.” He did, but Mr. Gounder didn’t call. He called back two days later, and the day after that, and the following Monday, and then he went back to the office. The receptionist who reminded him of his son’s girlfriend gave him a shocked look. “Hello,” he said, and tried out that shy smile. “I wonder if I might see that Mr. Gounder.” She grew visibly uncomfortable. “Mr. Gounder isn’t in today,” she lied. “I see,” he said. “Will he be in tomorrow?” “No,” she said. “The day after?” “No.” Softer. “Is that Mr. Gounder of yours ever coming in?” She sighed. “Mr. Gounder doesn’t want to speak with you, I’m sorry.” The smile hadn’t worked, so he switched to the look he used to give his bandmates when they wouldn’t cooperate. “Maybe someone can tell me why?” A door behind her had been open a crack; now it swung wide and a young man came out. He looked Hispanic, with a sharp fade and flashy sneakers, but he didn’t talk like a club kid or a hood rat—­he sounded like a USC law student. “Sir, if you have a claim you’d like Mr. Gounder to engage with, please have your attorney contact him directly.” Stefon looked this kid up and down and up, tried and failed to catch the receptionist’s eye, and said, “Maybe I can talk this over with you. Are you someone in charge around here?” “I’m Xavier Perez. I’m vice president for catalog development here. I don’t deal with legal claims, though. That’s strictly Mr. Gounder’s job. Please have your attorney put your query in writing and Mr. Gounder will be in touch as soon as is ­feasible.” “I did have a lawyer write him a letter,” Stefon said. “I gave it to this young woman. Mr. Gounder hasn’t been in touch.” Perez looked at the receptionist. “Did you receive a letter from this gentleman?” She nodded, still not meeting Stefon’s eye. “I gave it to Mr. Gounder last week.” Perez grinned, showing a gold tooth, and then, in his white, white voice, said, “There you have it. I’m sure Mr. Gounder will get back in touch with your counsel soon. Thank you for coming in today, Mr.—­” “Stefon Magner.” Stefon waited a moment, then said, for the first time in many years, “I used to perform under Steve Soul, though.” Perez nodded briskly. He’d known that. “Nice to meet you, Mr. Magner.” Without waiting for a reply, he disappeared back into his office.

## Biden’s Shifting Tailpipe Emissions Rules

date: 2024-02-19, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDM0MDAwMC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODQzODE2Nn0.7qLtGHwtvJDuHPOt-W4Ue-pqu3d_1ggV3S7sxzg1utg/image.png?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C1%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/><p><em><strong>Current conditions: </strong>A sandstorm blanketed China’s Xinjiang region in a cloud of yellow dust • Perth, Australia, has seen seven February days with temperatures over 104 degrees Fahrenheit • At least three planes hit speeds of 800 mph thanks to a powerful jet stream over the Atlantic.</em></p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Biden administration expected to ease tailpipe emissions rules</h3><p><strong></strong>The Biden administration will scale back a proposal to set aggressive limits on vehicle tailpipe emissions, a move seen as a “concession to automakers and labor unions,” <em>The New York Times </em><a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=6198bb657c&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">reported</a> over the weekend. Two sources confirmed the news to <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=377c73244f&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Reuters</em></a>, as well. The Environmental Protection Agency’s original proposal, aimed at speeding the nation’s shift to zero-emissions electric vehicles, would have resulted in EVs making up 60% of new vehicle sales by 2030, rising to 67% by 2032. For context, EVs accounted for just 7.6% of new car sales last year. Carmakers and the United Auto Workers union called the proposal unreasonable, citing high EV prices and a lack of charging infrastructure. The new rules are expected to give manufacturers more time to ramp up EV sales. The move “could be worth it” if it boosts Biden’s re-election bid against Donald Trump, analysts told the <em>Times</em>. But some researchers warn it will lead to faster warming.</p><h3>2. Another atmospheric river drenches California</h3><p><strong></strong>The West Coast isn’t getting much relief from the rain. Another atmospheric river is lashing California, following intense rain earlier this month that triggered flooding and landslides across cities including Los Angeles. Those regions are expected to see <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=b9e178c0ef&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">“much less rain”</a> with this storm, which will continue through Wednesday, but some areas remain at risk of flooding and mudslides because they’re still saturated from the last soaker. Flood watches are in effect up and down the coastline, covering nearly <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=17fab12c27&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">30 million people</a>. The flood risk will be highest Tuesday morning, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=8994ea5e2a&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> weather service meteorologist David Gomberg.</p><h3>3. Natural gas prices plummet</h3><p><strong></strong>Natural gas prices in the U.S. are nearing their lowest levels in 30 years thanks to a lack of demand combined with soaring production, the <em>Financial Times</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=130e96ad77&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>. The country is experiencing its warmest winter on record due to a combination of global warming and El Niño, so demand for the fuel to help heat homes is low. Meanwhile, gas production hit a record high in December. But some producers have signaled they plan to cut back on drilling programs. </p><h3>4. Therapists report rise in patients with climate anxiety </h3><p><strong></strong>Therapists are seeing more patients experiencing climate anxiety, and they’re grappling with the best ways to treat them, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=25921c9a4d&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">reported</a> <em>Bloomberg</em>. Weather disasters and big climate conferences tend to be followed by an uptick in patients, and scientists studying the crisis are especially vulnerable. Most therapists aren’t making any diagnoses, because “anxiety about climate change isn’t a disorder.” Instead they’re looking for a new playbook for treating a rising existential threat. One interesting observation? It seems climate anxiety and climate denial can sometimes overlap: “The conspiracy theorists are reassuring,” psychotherapist Caroline Hickman said. “If you can’t tolerate anxiety, you will then spin off into believing somebody who gives you false promises.”</p><h3>5. Study: Forest restoration cools eastern U.S.</h3><p><strong></strong>Research suggests that reforestation efforts in the southeastern United States have helped cool the region over the last century. “In addition to regulating atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, forests modify surface and near-surface air temperatures,” the authors <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=dcb070da17&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">wrote</a>. They estimate the annual cooling effect of forests to be between 1.8 degrees and 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. On sweltering summer days, the trees lower temperatures by up to 9 degrees Fahrenheit. “Moving forward, we need to think about tree planting not just as a way to absorb carbon dioxide but also the cooling effects in adapting for climate change, to help cities be resilient against these very hot temperatures,” Mallory Barnes, an environmental scientist at Indiana University, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=6d3e88df63&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a><em> The Guardian</em>.</p><h2>THE KICKER</h2><p><em>“[R]ather than echoing the concerns of a vocal minority that opposes any form of climate action, we need to effectively communicate that the vast majority of people around the world are willing to act against climate change and expect their national government to act.” </em>–A team of researchers behind a recent <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=516ab990a4&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> that found we may be vastly <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=22e5b60954&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">underestimating global support for climate action</a><span></span></p>

## Presidents Day: From George Washington's Modest Birthdays to Big Sales, 3-Day Weekends

date: 2024-02-19, from: VOA News USA

NORFOLK, Va. — Like the other Founding Fathers, George Washington was uneasy about the idea of publicly celebrating his life. He was the first leader of a new republic — not a tyrant.


And yet the nation will once again commemorate the first U.S. president on Monday, 292 years after he was born.


The meaning of Presidents Day has changed dramatically, from being mostly unremarkable and filled with work for Washington in the 1700s to the consumerism bonanza it has become today. For some historians the holiday has lost all discernible meaning.


Historian Alexis Coe, author of "You Never Forget Your First: A Biography of George of Washington," said she thinks about Presidents Day in much the same way as the towering monument in D.C. that bears his name.


"It's supposed to be about Washington, but can you really point to anything that looks or sounds like him?" she said. "Jefferson and Lincoln are presented as people with limbs and noses and words associated with their memorials. And he's just a giant, granite point. He has been sanded down to have absolutely no identifiable features."


Here is a look at how things have evolved:


Washington's birthdays 


Washington was born Feb. 22, 1732, on Popes Creek Plantation near the Potomac River in Virginia.


Technically, though, he was born Feb. 11 under the ancient Julian calendar, which was still in use for the first 20 years of his life. The Gregorian calendar, intended to more accurately mark the solar year, was adopted in 1752, adding 11 days.


Either way, Washington paid little attention to his birthday according to Mountvernon.org, the website of the organization that manages his estate. Surviving records make no mention of observances at Mount Vernon, while his diary shows he was often hard at work.


"If he had it his way, he would be at home with his family," Coe said. "Maybe some beloved nieces and nephews [and friend] Marquis de Lafayette would be ideal. And Martha's recipe for an indulgent cake. But that's about it."


Washington's birthday was celebrated by his peers in government when he was president — mostly.


Congress voted during his first two terms to take a short commemorative break each year, with one exception, his last birthday in office, Coe said. By then Washington was less popular, partisanship was rampant and many members of his original Cabinet were gone, including Thomas Jefferson.


"One way to show their disdain for his Federalist policies was to keep working through his birthday," Coe said.


The Library of Congress does note that a French military officer, the comte de Rochambeau, threw a ball celebrating Washington's 50th birthday in 1782.


After his death


Washington was very aware of his inaugural role as president and its distinction from the British crown. He didn't want to be honored like a king, said Seth Bruggeman, a history professor at Temple University in Philadelphia.


Still, he said, a market for Washington memorabilia sprang up almost immediately after his death in 1799 at age 67, with people snapping up pottery and reproductions of etchings portraying him as a divine figure going off into heaven.


"Even in that early moment, Americans kind of conflated consumerism with patriotic memory," said Bruggeman, whose books include "Here, George Washington Was Born: Memory, Material Culture, and the Public History of a National Monument." 


Making it official 


It wasn't until 1832, the centennial of his birth, that Congress established a committee to arrange national "parades, orations and festivals," according to the Congressional Research Service.


And only in 1879 was his birthday formally made into a legal holiday for federal employees in the District of Columbia.


The official designation is as Washington's Birthday, although it has come to be known informally as Presidents Day. Arguments have been made to honor President Lincoln as well because his birthdate falls nearby, on Feb. 12.


A small number of states, including Illinois, observe Lincoln's birthday as a public holiday, according to the Library of Congress. And some commemorate both Lincoln and Washington on Presidents Day.


But on the federal level, the day is still officially Washington's Birthday.


Shift to consumerism


By the late 1960s, Washington's Birthday was one of nine federal holidays that fell on specific dates on different days of the week, according to a 2004 article in the National Archives' Prologue magazine.


Congress voted to move some of those to Mondays, following concerns that were in part about absenteeism among government workers when a holiday fell midweek. But lawmakers also noted clear benefits to the economy, including boosts in retail sales and travel on three-day weekends.


The Uniform Monday Holiday Act took effect in 1971, moving Presidents Day to the third Monday in February. Sales campaigns soared, historian C.L. Arbelbide wrote in Prologue.


Bruggeman said Washington and the other Founding Fathers "would have been deeply worried" by how the holiday became taken over by commercial and private interests.


"They were very nervous about corporations," Bruggeman said. "It wasn't that they forbade them. But they saw corporations as like little republics that potentially threatened the power of The Republic."


Coe, who is also a fellow at the Washington think tank New America, said by now the day is devoid of recognizable traditions.


"There's no moment of reflection," Coe said. Given today's widespread cynicism toward the office, she added, that sort of reflection "would probably be a good idea."

## California Again Braces for Flooding as Another Wet Winter Storm Hits the State

date: 2024-02-19, from: VOA News USA

SAN FRANCISCO — The latest in a series of wet winter storms gained strength in California early Monday, with forecasters warning of possible flooding, hail, strong winds and even brief tornadoes as the system moves south over the next few days.


Gusts topped 30 mph (48 kph) in Oakland and San Jose as a mild cold front late Saturday gave way to a more powerful storm on Sunday, said meteorologist Brayden Murdock with the National Weather Service office in San Francisco.


“The winds are here and getting stronger, and the rains will follow quickly,” he said Sunday afternoon.


California’s central coast is at risk of “significant flooding,” with up to 5 inches (12 cm) of rain predicted for many areas, according to the weather service. Isolated rain totals of 10 inches (25 cm) are possible in the Santa Lucia and Santa Ynez mountain ranges as the storm heads toward greater Los Angeles.


Thunderstorms in valleys around the state capital on Monday could bring “brief tornadoes, large amounts of small hail, heavy rain, lightning, and gusty winds,” the weather service office in Sacramento warned on X, formerly Twitter.


The latest storm is expected to move through quicker than the devastating atmospheric river that parked itself over Southern California earlier this month, turning roads into rivers, causing hundreds of landslides and killing at least nine people.


“It’s not the ideal setup for an atmospheric river, but it does have some of the characteristics,” including a band of subtropical moisture bringing up the rear of the storm, Murdock said. “Otherwise it’s just a cold front.”


But it’s a cold front strong enough to cause problems including flash flooding and power outages, forecasters said. Flood watches and warnings were issued in coastal and mountain areas up and down the state.


Rainfall will be widespread even in the mountains, but several feet of snow is possible at elevations above about 6,800 feet (2,070 meters) across the Sierra Nevada, the weather service said. Motorists are urged to avoid mountain routes.


“Consider completing Sierra travel during the day Sunday, or rescheduling to later next week,” said the weather service office in Reno, Nevada. The office issued a backcountry avalanche watch for the greater Lake Tahoe area and the eastern Sierra in Inyo and Mono counties.


The California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services activated its operations center Saturday and positioned personnel and equipment in areas most at risk.

## Biden to Welcome Kenyan President to the White House in May

date: 2024-02-19, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden plans to welcome Kenyan President William Ruto to the White House in May, hosting a state visit after reneging on his promise to visit Africa last year.


White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Friday that the visit set for May 23 will mark the 60th anniversary of U.S.-Kenya diplomatic relations and "celebrate a partnership that is delivering for the people" of both countries while affirming "our strategic partnership" with Ruto's country.


It "will strengthen our shared commitment to advance peace and security, expand our economic ties, and stand together in defense of democratic values," Jean-Pierre said in a statement. "The leaders will discuss ways to bolster our cooperation in areas including people-to-people ties, trade and investment, technological innovation, climate and clean energy, health, and security."




Word of Ruto's visit comes after Haiti announced this week that it is working on an official agreement with Kenyan officials to secure the long-awaited deployment of Kenyan police forces there. High-ranking officials from both countries recently met in the U.S. for three days to draft a memorandum of understanding and set a deadline for the arrival of forces in Haiti from the east African country.


Jean-Pierre added Friday that, beyond Kenya, Ruto's visit to Washington will "further the vision" that "African leadership is essential to addressing global priorities."


First lady Jill Biden traveled to Kenya last February during a five-day, two-country tour of the continent. The White House also confirmed that both Ruto and Kenyan first lady Rachel Ruto will be honored with a dinner with the Bidens.


The White House hosted a state dinner celebrating close ally Australia in October, which followed the president's skipping a stop in that country earlier in 2023 to focus on debt limit talks in Washington. But those festivities last fall were toned down some given Israel's ongoing war with Hamas.


Biden said in December 2022 that he would visit sub-Saharan Africa the following year, which would have made him the first U.S. president to travel there in a decade. The president pledged at the end of a U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington with 49 leaders, in which he suggested the continent would be a strategic focus as the U.S. made political and financial commitments.


But other priorities interceded in 2023. Biden pulled off last-minute trips to Israel and Vietnam, as well as a secretive journey to Ukraine. He ended last year by skipping a December U.N. climate change conference in Dubai, while sending Vice President Kamala Harris in his place, and never scheduled an Africa trip.


Biden is now seeking reelection in November's election while juggling a host of pressing foreign security matters, including the Israel-Hamas war and continuing discussion in Congress over proposed foreign aid for Ukraine amid its war with Russia.


On Friday he traveled to East Palestine, Ohio, making good on months of saying he'd visit the site of a Norfolk Southern train derailment that spilled a cocktail of hazardous chemicals and caught fire in February 2023.


Vice President Kamala also spoke Friday at the Munich Security Conference and was asked about Washington's "growing transitional mindset" toward Africa — a characterization she disputed, countering that "the future has to be about partnership and investment."


"I believe that we must think differently about the relationship between the United States and the continent of Africa," the vice president said, adding, "We look at the future of the continent and how it will affect the world: It is indisputable. There will be a direct impact."


Harris noted that the median age on the African continent is 19 and that population growth means that, in the coming decades, as many as 1 in 4 people in the world will live there.


"In terms of the future, we must see the innovation that is currently happening there and partner with African leaders and nations," she said.

A few weeks ago, my local supermarket converted to a &ldquo;Woolworths Metro&rdquo; store, and I had no idea what the implications of that were, except that they stopped stocking some stuff I actually want and need (cooking ingredients, mainly) in favour of expanding their range of potato chips. <em>Now</em> I see why they&rsquo;ve done this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[W]hile Woolworths supermarkets are subject to a flat pricing system — which means all products except fresh produce are sold at the same price wherever you are in the country — the same does not apply to Metros.</p>
