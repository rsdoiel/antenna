“optimistically cautious” forecast for the year ahead</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
Economic forecasts for the coming year are decently optimistic, painting
a picture of fairly low unemployment, gradually slowing inflation and
continued economic growth. But there are still risks to this mostly
sunny outlook — some that are global and some coming from D.C. Plus,
soft landing or not, the Richmond Fed president advises us to buckle up.
Oh, and Happy Dry January!

<li>Tesla and Rivian release Q4 sales numbers
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>Tesla and Rivian yesterday reported their production
and sales figures for the final three months of 2023: Tesla delivered
484,507, besting expectations. Rivian, a newcomer still trying to secure
itself a foothold in the market, delivered 13,972 cars over the same
time period, missing estimates by a hair. “The two companies’ numbers
serve as snapshots of both the promise and peril of auto electrification
as we roll into 2024,”

Matthew Zeitlin at <em>Heatmap</em>. Tesla, having been overtaken by BYD
in the global EV market, must now focus on scaling beyond the early EV
adopters. Rivian, however, is at a very different stage, Zeitlin says:
“not the early days of using investor money to develop a new vehicle,
but the next stage, where you have an actual car to sell but you have to
figure out a way to make money doing it.”

Martha’s Vineyard and will eventually consist of 62 turbines that can
power more than 400,000 homes and businesses in Massachusetts. Its first
five turbines have been installed, and things were looking good for a

said</a> the project needed more testing. No timeline was given but the
spokesperson said the goal was to “deliver power to shore soon.” The
project was supposed to be fully operational by the middle of 2024 but
developers have now “clarified” that the timeline is sometime within
2024. In December, the South Fork Wind project in New York

<li>U.K. fossil fuel electricity generation drops to 66-year low

<p>
<strong></strong>The amount of the United Kingdom’s electricity that
came from fossil fuels dropped by 22% last year to the lowest level
since 1957,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=95354efb78&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according
to</a> <em>CarbonBrief</em>. Electricity from coal, oil, and gas peaked
in 2008 but has since plummeted thanks to the rapid expansion of
renewables like wind and solar, a drop in electricity demand, and a
boost in electricity imports. Coal use is down 97% since 2008; gas is
down by 45%. Meanwhile, renewables output has increased six-fold, and
last year renewable energy was the UK’s single largest source of power.
“Overall, the electricity generated in the UK in 2023 had the
lowest-ever carbon intensity,” <em>CarbonBrief</em> concludes.
<br/><br/>On the flip side, UK power generation from nuclear plants
dropped to a 42-year low last year as old stations were decommissioned.
Without more nuclear power to fall back on during cloudy or wind-free
days, the country may have to rely more on fossil fuels,

<strong></strong>A major carbon removal project planned for Wyoming
would rely on small modular nuclear reactors – a new kind of nuclear
power plant that has never been built in the U.S. – prompting concerns
about its feasibility,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=24b14b79f2&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a><em>

more than $10 million from the Department of Energy to explore plans for
a direct air capture hub in Wyoming, dubbed “Project Bison.” Scientists
say removing carbon from the air is necessary to help fight global
warming. Small modular reactors could, in theory, provide carbon capture
facilities with emissions-free power, but the nation’s first small

from Virginia Tech and the U.S. Geological Survey finds that major
cities on the East Coast – from New York to Virginia Beach – are
sinking. The team analyzed satellite data to spot land subsidence and
found that some areas are sinking by as much as 5 millimeters per year.
This subsidence, when combined with sea level rise caused by climate
change, means essential structures like roads to airports are at risk in
many major U.S. cities. “The problem is that the hotspots of sinking
land intersect directly with population and infrastructure hubs,”

Pollan Rule Applies to Fashion, Too</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDg2ODcxOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMTU3NzUxNH0.t4kM3WfHp30rfAUO_NHoGxw-EYS7DH4lJOKQoTuX16Y/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
News broke in early November that the U.S. federal dietary guidelines
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/11/07/dietary-guidelines-ultraprocessed-foods/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">might
soon warn</a> Americans against eating “ultraprocessed food.”
</p>
<p>
It’s far from a done deal — an advisory committee is merely examining
the issue, with no action expected before 2025. But it’s still somewhat
of a <em>duh</em> moment for the millions of people who, over the past
two decades, have turned away from food that comes in instant packets,
boxes, and cans, and toward things that come from the produce aisle or
the farmers market. Recent research
<a href="https://slate.com/technology/2023/07/ultraprocessed-foods-parenting-health.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">makes
a strong case that</a> — more than individual villains like sugar, corn
syrup, trans fats, and salt — it’s the way all these ingredients and
more are pounded, mixed, extruded, and stuffed into shelf-stable forms
that lead to health problems and weight gain.
</p>
<p>
Michael Pollan — the author who brought you the mantra “Eat real food,
not too much, mostly plants” — is arguably one of the biggest catalysts
for the real food movement. In a
<a href="https://www.masterclass.com/classes/michael-pollan-teaches-intentional-eating/chapters/eat-food" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lesson
from his Masterclass on intentional eating</a>, he warns against foods
with “very long ingredient lists,” saying that “the simplest way to
think about an ultraprocessed food is you can’t imagine making it at
home.”
</p>
<p>
You’ve heard of fast food and its linguistic child: the
<a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/environmental-costs-fast-fashion" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">environmental
scourge</a> that is fast fashion. I would like to add a new term to the
health and environmental zeitgeist:
</p>
<p>
Ultraprocessed fashion.
</p>
<h3>
Corn Syrup versus Gore-Tex
</h3>
<p>
In the early 2010s, I saw my own health and happiness vastly improve
after overhauling my diet to eat whole, farm-fresh foods. But I wanted
to take it further. I figured that if it matters to the environment and
our health where we buy our food from, it might matter where we get
other things, like beauty products, home goods, and fashion.
</p>
<p>
Still, for a long, the argument for U.S. shoppers in favor of buying
more sustainable fashion — the kind of classic, durable pieces
skillfully made of natural fibers by artisans and American factories —
was largely an altruistic one. Sustainable fashion purchases were meant
to benefit a cotton farmer in India you would never meet, to protect a
river in Kenya you would never see, or support a community of
craftspeople in Thailand you would never have the privilege of knowing.
</p>
<p>
Even more nebulous, arguments that purchasing <em>this</em> instead of
<em>that </em>would prevent the release of (super rough estimate) a few
pounds of invisible climate-polluting gas into the atmosphere have not
proven to be a very strong motivator for shoppers. In survey after
survey, consumers
<a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/opinions/sustainability/sustainability-surveys-fashion-consumers-black-friday/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">swear
up and down</a> that they care deeply about sustainability … as long as
it doesn’t inconvenience them, cost more money, or look too crunchy.
</p>
<p>
That’s an impossible standard. Sustainable fashion, whether it takes the
form of a 100% wool sweater from California, a hand-block-printed cotton
sundress, or a naturally dyed button-down, is always going to be more
expensive than its synthetic counterpart made in a sweatshop somewhere
where the workers are cheap and the laws are loose. Neither does slow
fashion keep up with TikTok trends, by definition.
</p>
<p>
I initially had a hard time connecting sustainable fashion to Western
shoppers’ well-being beyond the argument that an overstuffed, chaotic
closet full of fast fashion can’t be good for your mental health or time
management. After all, we’re not eating our clothing, right?
</p>
<p>
That all changed in 2019, when I first heard that Delta Air Lines
attendants were
<a href="https://deltaafa.org/news/toxic-uniform-lands-end-class-action-lawsuit" target="_blank">suing</a>
Lands’ End, the maker of their uniforms, saying the new clothes were
making them sick.
</p>
<p>
If you could call any clothing ultraprocessed, it would be these
uniforms. While old airline outfits were made of traditional wool
suiting and cotton button-downs in staid colors, the uniforms introduced
in the past decade or so at
<a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-017-4982-4" target="_blank">Alaska
Airlines</a>,
<a href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/airlines-airports/american-airlines/american-airlines-new-uniforms-lawsuit" target="_blank">American
Airlines</a>,
<a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/7/16/20686075/flight-attendants-uniform-sick-delta-alaska-twin-hill-lands-end" target="_blank">Delta</a>,
and
<a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/southwest-air-toxic-uniform-class-claims-advance-against-cintas" target="_blank">Southwest</a>
all were made of synthetic blends. They came in super-saturated colors
and were coated in layers of performance chemicals: flame retardants,
Teflon for stain resistance, and formaldehyde-based wrinkle-free
finishes. They were made fast and cheap by suppliers in countries with
lax environmental standards.
</p>
<p>
As I reported in my book
<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/705645/to-dye-for-by-alden-wicker/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>To
Dye For: How Toxic Fashion Is Making Us Sick – and How We Can Fight
Back</em></a><em>, </em>at every single one of those four major
airlines, up to a quarter of the attendants reported having health
reactions, including rashes and skin burns, breathing problems, hair
loss, blurry vision, brain fog, and extreme fatigue. Some attendants had
to be taken off their planes and brought to the ER. Though the lawsuit
by Delta flight attendants didn’t move forward, in November of this year
a jury awarded
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2023/11/02/flight-attendants-toxic-uniforms-verdict/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">over
$1 million</a> to four American Airlines flight attendants who said
their Twin Hill uniforms made them sick.
</p>
<p>
The next question that arises is: Is this happening to regular folks,
too? And the answer is yes, but in more subtle and insidious ways. For
example, the kinds of dyes used on synthetic materials like polyester
(disperse dyes)
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12165928/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">are
well-known to dermatologists</a> to be common skin sensitizers. But many
people may not know it’s clothing exacerbating their toddler’s eczema or
setting off their own skin problems.
</p>
<p>
But the issue is more serious than just rashes, though rashes are often
the first sign that something is wrong. Researchers and advocacy groups
have tested fashion from well-known brands and counterfeits alike
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/jul/02/fashion-chemicals-pfas-bpa-toxic" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">and
found</a> heavy metals like lead, chromium, and cadmium; endocrine
disruptors like Bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, and per-and
poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS); biocides, pesticides, and
fungicides; and known carcinogens like benzene, certain azo dyes, and
formaldehyde. (This is an abbreviated list, by the way.)
</p>
<p>
We’ve known for a long time these chemicals end up in our water and
environment. PFAS, a toxic class of chemicals used for imbuing
synthetics with water resistance, has been found all
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/mt-everest-pollution/2021/04/16/7b341ff0-909f-11eb-bb49-5cb2a95f4cec_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">over
Mount Everest’s summit</a>, for example. But what we’re increasingly
seeing is that our fashion, like our diets, affects our physical health.
</p>
<p>
Take microfibers, which in Heatmap’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/change-polling-concern-belief-republicans-vs-democrats" target="_self">recent
survey</a> were deemed to be a problem by 61% of respondents, and an
“extremely serious” problem by 25% of respondents. When microfibers come
off our clothes in the wash or break off our clothes and become part of
our house dust, they bring with them everything that is in and on
clothing. Given that we’re
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10151227/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ingesting
microfibers every day</a>, we <em>are</em> eating our clothes. We’re
also breathing in their VOCs, and our sweat is
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2023/nov/02/workout-clothes-sweat-chemicals-cancer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pulling
those chemicals out of fibers onto our skin</a>, where they can be
absorbed into our bloodstream.
</p>
<p>
One of the main reasons fashion has turned from a field-to-closet
endeavor to a chemistry experiment is the same as for food: It’s more
profitable to sell highly processed, branded products made exclusively
from petrochemicals and with a lot of marketing promises than it is to
sell traditional pieces made from natural materials.
</p>
<p>
This happens at both ends of the fashion spectrum. At the low end, as
Shein has shown, you can grow your company at an unprecedented speed by
sourcing huge volumes of $5 polyester minidresses from garment factories
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/30/shein-faces-scrutiny-over-forced-labor-before-ipo.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">with
dubious working conditions</a>, according to numerous reports.
</p>
<p>
At the other end, a company can add proprietary, brand-name chemistry
like Gore-Tex to outdoor gear and sell it at a huge markup. Just observe
<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@chadahooche_/video/7307625278484811051" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
bit currently going around on TikTok</a> where a spouse or partner
requests you wear your most expensive clothing to an event or to meet
the parents, so you show up in hiking gear.
</p>
<p>
Sure, if you’re a professional fisherman plowing through rough seas for
your catch, a first responder, or a scientist living in the Arctic, you
may well need high-performance gear. But for the rest of us, it’s just
aspirational marketing, kind of like drinking Gatorade while you’re on
the couch watching football.
</p>
<h3>
Yes, It’s That Bad
</h3>
<p>
Like the food industry before it, the fashion industry’s focus when it
comes to safe and non-toxic fashion has been on individual chemicals or
classes of chemicals instead of the holistic picture. The (completely
voluntary) standards used by some fashion brands and certifications will
test a textile for a tiny percentage of the
<a href="https://icca-chem.org/news/how%E2%80%91do%E2%80%91we%E2%80%91calculate-the%20-number%E2%80%91of%E2%80%91chemicals%E2%80%91in%E2%80%91use-around-the-globe/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tens
of thousands</a> of possible chemical substances in circulation, and if
each is under the (often arbitrary) limit, the fashion piece will be
declared safe.
</p>
<p>
This approach, however, doesn’t take into account how chemicals can mix
to have synergistic effects on the same organs or cause the same health
effects.
</p>
<p>
For example, it’s completely within the realm of possibility for one
clothing item or outfit to have BPA, phthalates, <em>and</em> PFAS, each
of which by itself wreaks havoc on our hormonal system, even
<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/low-doses-hormone-like-chemicals-may-have-big-effects/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in
tiny, tiny amounts</a>. Some of these chemicals are used to process
fibers. Some chemicals such as finishes, dyes, and glues are used
deliberately and are meant to stay in and on the fashion. Some chemicals
are accidental contaminants, as fabrics and components flow through an
opaque, unregulated, and just plain sloppy supply chain.
</p>
<p>
That then can affect everything from our reproductive system and energy
levels to our skin appearance and weight. And all this while you’re
trying to take care of your health by taking a hike or hitting the gym.
It kind of reminds me of when cereal brands will brag about the vitamins
they’ve added to their sugary, processed cereal.
</p>
<p>
What’s more, unlike food, cleaning products, and beauty products,
clothing doesn’t come with a complete ingredient list. Anything under 5%
of the weight of the product doesn’t have to be included. So what kind
of finishes, dyes, threads, or contaminants are present in any piece of
fashion is somewhat of a mystery.
</p>
<p>
When people ask me what they should buy or what they should clean out of
their closets, I usually give them a list of things to look for and
things to avoid — yes to natural fibers like cotton, wool, linen, bamboo
rayon, and silk; no to toxic “vegan” leather polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
and other synthetics, which are more likely to contain hazardous or
sensitizing chemicals; avoid neon bright colors and buy naturally dyed
or undyed products when you can; don’t dry clean your clothes.
</p>
<p>
But a simpler way to think about it would be to avoid clothing and
accessories that your grandparents would look askance at, just like
Pollan has encouraged us to do at the grocery store. Wait, what is
Pertex® 20D Diamond Fuse Ripstop nylon? Or a polyester Lycra® elastane
blend with anti-odor technology? What does it mean when something has
Durable Water Repellant? What is actually in Memory Foam™ or the smelly
glue that bonds it to the bottom of a sneaker? Do you really believe
that a piece of clothing that smells like gasoline out of the box is
okay for your health — or for anyone’s health? Which sounds better to
you: chromium-tanned leather or vegetable-tanned leather?
</p>
<p>
Sure, it may take a bit more time, skill, and investment than buying
synthetic clothing that you drop off at the dry cleaner. But then again,
so does making a nutritious meal from ingredients you get at the
farmer’s market. And, I would argue, both are a core part of cultivating
a healthier, more vibrant, community-oriented, and nurturing life.

<h2 id="answers-to-my-analytics-inquiry">Answers to my analytics
inquiry</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
I’m aware it’s not Saturday but I realised I didn’t need to collect a
full week worth of data to get
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/analytics-inquiry">an answer to my
question</a> and so I decided that three full days were enough. I have
data for December 30th and 31st and January 1st. That’s more that
enough. So let’s do some digging shall we.
</p>
<h2>
A quick acknowledgement
</h2>
<p>
Before I cruch the numbers I want to highlight two people who got in
touch mentioning their similar experiments:
<a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2020/google-vs-netlify-analytics/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Jim
Nielsen</a>—who’s also a
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-jim-nielsen">P&amp;B guest</a>—and
<a href="https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/analytics-for-sites-with-tech-savvy-audiences/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Chris
Krycho</a>.
</p>
<h2>
The metrics
</h2>
<p>
I think it’s important to first establish what these tools are
measuring. I’m interested in one single data point: how many people have
accessed my content. Should be simple enough in theory. That information
is often referred to as Unique user or Unique visitor. But how are these
tools determining what counts as unique?
</p>
<p>
Plausible doesn’t use cookies and to track unique visitors they do the
following:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Every single HTTP request sends the IP address and the User-Agent to the
server so that’s what we use. We generate a daily changing identifier
using the visitor’s IP address and User-Agent. To anonymize these
datapoints and make them impossible to relate back to the user, we run
them through a hash function with a rotating salt.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
So a combination of IP and User Agent. So if someone if browsing from
different devices they’d probably be counted multiple times.
<a href="https://plausible.io/data-policy">More info are available on
the Plausible website</a>.
</p>
<p>
Simple Analytics tracks a slightly different metric called “unique
visits” which is based, according to their docs, on the referrer.
<a href="https://docs.simpleanalytics.com/explained/unique-visits">More
info at this page</a>.
</p>
<p>
Fathom tracks “Visitors” defined as:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A visitor is a unique person who’s visited your site.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Not very helpful. I tried to poke around the docs but I couldn’t find
how they track it so I’ll move on to the final platform, Pirsch. They do
something similar to what Plausible is doing
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Pirsch generates a unique number for each visitor calculated from the
visitor’s IP address, the User-Agent, and a random string that is set
for each website.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Finally, we have Goaccess, the tool I’m going to use to analyse my
server logs. Goaccess defines a Unique Visitor as
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
HTTP requests containing the same IP, the same date, and the same user
agent are considered a unique visitor. By default, it includes web
crawlers/spiders.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We have our definitions, it’s time to get to some numbers.
</p>
<h2>
The numbers
</h2>
<p>
These are the (Unique) Visitors reported by the four online services and
my server logs
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Plausible <code>358</code>
</li>
<li>
Fathom <code>403</code>
</li>
<li>
Pirsch <code>273</code>
</li>
<li>
Simple Analytics <code>728</code>
</li>
<li>
Server Logs <code>3894</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Already, the difference between logs and client analytics is HUGE. But
we need to dig a bit deeper into the logs because the situation there is
messy. To start, there’s the issue of bots, spiders and crawlers.
Goaccess has an optional flag I turned on to ignore a huge number of
those. That <code>3894</code> is already ignoring a good % of non-human
traffic. But I am sure something is still slipping through. Another
thing that is present in my server logs that is obviously not present in
the other four tools is RSS traffic because the JS necessary to keep
track of the traffic is not included in the RSS feed. If I remove all
the entries in my logs mentioning either <code>rss</code> or
<code>feed</code> the Unique Visitors go from <code>3894</code> to
<code>2111</code>. Lower but still way higher than the client side data
that was averaging around <code>440</code>.
</p>
<p>
Clearly more work is needed on these logs because they’re incredibly
noisy. I removed all 404s, manually removed all the entries mentioning
any type of bot, I also grabbed only entries matching this regex
<code>(Gecko|Chrome|Firefox|AppleWebKit|Mac OS|Windows
NT|Android)</code>. And that leaves us with <code>1821</code> unique
visitors, according to my logs.
</p>
<p>
That number is still a lot higher than what I’m seeing in the online
dashboard so what gives? Well, I think something obvious is happening
here. I am a web developer with an indie blog that is followed by a lot
of people who are also passionate about the web and are tech savvy. So
I’d bet the % of people running one or multiple ad blockers between my
readers is quite high. An article from the
<a href="https://plausible.io/blog/google-analytics-adblockers-missing-data">Plausible
blog</a> reports that a huge % of people is blocking google analytics
for example but I’m sure modern ad blockers are also preventing these
tools to work properly. Hell I had to disable mine just to access those
dashboards. My visits to my site were not counted. Estimating the number
of people running ad blockers is impossible and a quick online search
tells me the numbers are anything between 30% to 65%.
</p>
<p>
If I were to adjust the numbers coming out of the four tools I used
based on the 65% which is probably reasonable considering my type of
audience we’d get
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Plausible <code>967</code>
</li>
<li>
Fathom <code>1089</code>
</li>
<li>
Pirsch <code>737</code>
</li>
<li>
Simple Analytics <code>1967</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A lot closer to the <code>1821</code> coming out of my server logs. We
can probably safely assume that some of those <code>1821</code> are bots
cleverly disguised as genuine traffic and the true number has to be
somewhere in the <code>~1200</code> range.
</p>
<p>
So, do I finally have an answer? Is <code>~1200</code> the answer I was
looking for? Well, not quite. We excluded RSS earlier because it was not
part of the data gathered by the four client side tools but RSS traffic
is still traffic worth counting. Especially in 2024! Figuring out actual
RSS traffic is close to impossible. Goaccess tells me there were
<code>1973</code> unique IPs pinging the various feeds on my site. I’m
going to follow
<a href="https://darekkay.com/blog/rss-subscriber-count/">Darek</a> lead
here and simply count exposed subscribers. According to my logs we have:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
12 different Feedbin feeds with unique <code>feed-id</code> for a total
of <code>439</code> subscribers;
</li>
<li>
3 instances of Inoreader with very distinct subscribers number for a
total of <code>126</code>
</li>
<li>
4 Feedly instances with very distinct subscribers number for a total of
<code>391</code>
</li>
<li>
NewsBlur, BazQux Reader, and The Old Reader are the other services
exposing subscribers number and combined are other <code>70</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
So the total, according to these services is <code>1026</code>
subscribers, if my math is correct. Only thing missing to this weird
roundup is the <code>110</code> people who are getting my posts directly
in their inbox.
</p>
<h2>
The conclusion
</h2>
<p>
Is there even a lesson to be learn here? Don’t trust numbers blindly
perhaps? Server logs are messy and can be over inflated while client
based analytics can greatly under report your numbers if you have a very
tech savvy audience. Also RSS is still doing fine and you should
definitely have an RSS feed if you have a personal blog. And if you
don’t have a personal blog I don’t know what you’re waiting for. Ditch
social media and start blogging. You can thank me later. And if you
don’t know where to start hit me up and I’ll be happy to help.

National Debt Hits Record $34 Trillion as Congress Gears up for Funding
Fight</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The federal government’s gross national debt has
surpassed $34 trillion, a record high that foreshadows the coming
political and economic challenges to improve America’s balance sheet in
the coming years. </p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury Department issued a report Tuesday logging U.S.
finances, which have become a source of tension in a politically divided
Washington that could possibly see parts of the government shut down
without an annual budget in place. </p>
<p>Republican lawmakers and the White House agreed last June to
temporarily lift the nation’s debt limit, staving off the risk of what
would be a historic default. That agreement lasts until January 2025.
Here are some answers to questions about the new record national
debt. </p>
<p>How did the national debt hit $34 trillion?  </p>
<p>The national debt eclipsed $34 trillion several years sooner than
pre-pandemic projections. The Congressional Budget Office’s January 2020
projections had gross federal debt eclipsing $34 trillion in fiscal year
2029. </p>
<p>But the debt grew faster than expected because of a multiyear
pandemic starting in 2020 that shut down much of the U.S. economy. The
government borrowed heavily under then-President Donald Trump and
current President Joe Biden to stabilize the economy and support a
recovery. But the rebound came with a surge of inflation that pushed up
interest rates and made it more expensive for the government to service
its debts. </p>
<p>“So far, Washington has been spending money as if we had unlimited
resources,” said Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at Loyola
Marymount University. “But the bottom line is, there is no free lunch,”
he said. “And I think the outlook is pretty grim.” </p>
<p>The gross debt includes money that the government owes itself, so
most policymakers rely on the total debt held by the public in assessing
the government’s finances. This lower figure — $26.9 trillion — is
roughly equal in size to the U.S. gross domestic product. </p>
<p>Last June, the Congressional Budget Office estimated in its 30-year
outlook that publicly held debt will be equal to a record 181% of
American economic activity by 2053. </p>
<p>What is the impact to the economy?  </p>
<p>The national debt does not appear to be a weight on the U.S. economy
right now, as investors are willing to lend the federal government
money. This lending allows the government to keep spending on programs
without having to raise taxes. </p>
<p>But the debt’s path in the decades to come might put at risk national
security and major programs, including Social Security and Medicare,
which have become the most prominent drivers of forecasted government
spending over the next few decades. Government dysfunction, such as
another debt limit showdown, could also be a financial risk if investors
worry about lawmakers’ willingness to repay the U.S. debt. </p>
<p>Foreign buyers of U.S. debt — like China, Japan, South Korea and
European nations — have already cut down on their holdings of Treasury
notes. </p>
<p>A Peterson Foundation analysis states that foreign holdings of U.S.
debt peaked at 49% in 2011 but dropped to 30% by the end of 2022. </p>
<p>“Looking ahead, debt will continue to skyrocket as the Treasury
expects to borrow nearly $1 trillion more by the end of March,” said
Peterson Foundation CEO Michael Peterson. “Adding trillion after
trillion in debt, year after year, should be a flashing red warning sign
to any policymaker who cares about the future of our country. </p>
<p>How could it affect me?  </p>
<p>The debt equates to about $100,000 per person in the U.S. That sounds
like a lot, but the sum so far has not appeared to threaten U.S.
economic growth. </p>
<p>Instead, the risk is long term if the debt keeps rising to uncharted
levels. Sohn said a higher debt load could put upward pressure on
inflation and cause interest rates to remain elevated, which could also
increase the cost of repaying the national debt. </p>
<p>And as the debt challenge evolves over time, choices may become more
severe as the costs of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid
increasingly outstrip tax revenues. </p>
<p>When it could turn into a more dire situation is anyone’s guess, says
Shai Akabas, director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy
Center. “But if and when that happens, it could mean very significant
consequences that occur very quickly. </p>
<p>“It could mean spikes in interest rates. It could mean a recession
that leads to lots more unemployment. It could lead to another bout of
inflation or weird goings-on with consumer prices — several of which are
things that we’ve experienced just in the past few years,” he said. </p>
<p>How do Republicans and Democrats differ?  </p>
<p>Both Democrats and Republicans have called for debt reduction, but
they disagree on the appropriate means of doing so. </p>
<p>The Biden administration has been pushing for tax hikes on the
wealthy and corporations to reduce budget deficits, in addition to
funding its domestic agenda. Biden also increased the budget for the IRS
so that it can collect unpaid taxes and possibly reduce the debt by
hundreds of billions of dollars over 10 years. </p>
<p>Republican lawmakers have called for large cuts to non-defense
government programs and the repeal of clean energy tax credits and
spending passed in the Inflation Reduction Act. But Republicans also
want to trim Biden’s IRS funding and cut taxes further, both of which
could cause the debt to worsen. </p>
<p>A Treasury Department representative did not respond to a request for
comment. </p>
<p>“There is growing concern among investors and rating agencies that
the trajectory we’re on is unsustainable — when that turns into a more
dire situation is anyone’s guess,” Akabas said.</p>

Add Accusations to Bribery Indictment of US Senator</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — Federal authorities are accusing U.S. Senator Bob Menendez
of introducing a member of the Qatari royal family to a New Jersey
businessman seeking investments in a real estate project, an indictment
said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The indictment against the New Jersey Democrat in Manhattan federal
court did not identify the member of the Qatari royal family, but it
said the individual was a principal of the Qatari Investment
Company.</p>
<p>The indictment said the Qatari investor negotiated a
multimillion-dollar investment in the real estate project planned by
Fred Daibes, one of three businessmen charged in the indictment along
with the senator and his wife. All have pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>Messages left with lawyers and a spokesperson for Menendez were not
immediately returned.</p>
<p>Tim Donohue, a lawyer for Daibes, said he had no immediate
comment.</p>
<p>The indictment is the latest version of one that already charged
Menendez in a bribery conspiracy that allegedly enriched the senator and
his wife with cash, gold bars and a luxury car. The charges involving
Qatar allegedly occurred from 2021 through 2023, according to the
indictment, which did not add any new charges.</p>
<p>After his September arrest, the senator gave up his position as chair
of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He has resisted calls to
resign from his Senate seat.</p>
<p>According to the indictment, Menendez accepted cash and gold bars in
exchange for seeking to induce the Qatari Investment Company to invest
with Daibes, including by taking actions favorable to the government of
Qatar.</p>
<p>The indictment said that while the Qatari Investment Company was
considering its investment in the real estate development owned by
Daibes, Menendez made multiple public statements supporting the
government of Qatar and then provided them to Daibes so he could share
them with a Qatari investor and a Qatari government official.</p>
<p>In an earlier version of the indictment, Menendez, his wife and one
of the businessmen were charged with conspiring to illegally use the
senator as an agent of the Egyptian government.</p>
<p>Judge Sidney H. Stein, who is presiding over the case, refused last
week to extend a May 5 trial date after defense lawyers requested more
time to prepare for a trial that they said already includes more than
6.7 million documents.</p>

microbiota signatures associated with different types of urinary
diversion: a comparative study</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Radical cystectomy and urinary diversion (UD) are gold standards for
non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Orthotopic neobladder (or
Studer), ileal conduit (or Bricker) and cutaneous ureterostomy (CU) are
mainstream UD types. Little is known about urinary microbiological
changes after UD.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
In this study, urine samples were collected from healthy volunteers and
patients with bladder cancer who had received aforementioned UD
procedures. Microbiomes of samples were analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA
gene sequencing, and microbial diversities, distributions and functions
were investigated and compared across groups.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Highest urine microbial richness and diversity were observed in healthy
controls, followed by Studer patients, especially those without
hydronephrosis or residual urine, α-diversity indices of whom were
remarkably higher than those of Bricker and CU groups. Studer UD type
was the only independent factor favoring urine microbial diversity. The
urine microflora structure of the Studer group was most similar to that
of the healthy individuals while that of the CU group was least similar.
Studer patients and healthy volunteers shared many similar urine
microbial functions, while Bricker and CU groups exhibited opposite
characteristics.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Our study first presented urinary microbial landscapes of UD patients
and demonstrated the microbiological advantage of orthotopic neobladder.
Microbiota might be a potential tool for optimization of UD management.

and animal exposure to newly discovered sand fly viruses, China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
The Hedi virus (HEDV) and Wuxiang virus (WUXV) are newly discovered
Bunyaviruses transmitted by sandflies. The geographical distribution of
isolation of these two viruses continues to expand and it has been
reported that WUXV causes neurological symptoms and even death in
suckling mice. However, little is known about the prevalence of the two
viruses in mammalian infections.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
In order to understand the infection status of HEDV and WUXV in humans
and animals from regions where the viruses have been isolated, this
study used Western blotting to detect the positive rates of HEDV and
WUXV IgG antibodies in serum samples from febrile patients, dogs, and
chickens in the forementioned regions.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
The results showed that of the 29 human serum samples, 17.24% (5/29)
tested positive for HEDV, while 68.96% (20/29) were positive for WUXV.
In the 31 dog serum samples, 87.10% (27/31) were positive for HEDV and
70.97% (22/31) were positive for WUXV, while in the 36 chicken serum
samples, 47.22% (17/36) were positive for HEDV, and 52.78% (19/36) were
positive for WUXV.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Discussion
</title>
<p>
These findings suggest there are widespread infections of HEDV and WUXV
in mammals (dogs, chickens) and humans from the regions where these
viruses have been isolated. Moreover, the positive rate of HEDV
infections was higher in local animals compared to that measured in
human specimens. This is the first seroepidemiological study of these
two sandfly-transmitted viruses. The findings of the study have
practical implications for vector-borne viral infections and related
zoonotic infections in China, as well as providing an important
reference for studies on the relationship between sandfly-transmitted
viruses and zoonotic infections outside of China.

transmission of mosquito-borne viruses: a systematic review</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
A number of mosquito-borne viruses (MBVs), such as dengue virus (DENV),
zika virus (ZIKV), chikungunya (CHIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), and
yellow fever virus (YFV) exert adverse health impacts on the global
population. <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and <italic>Aedes
albopictus</italic> are the prime vectors responsible for the
transmission of these viruses. The viruses have acquired a number of
routes for successful transmission, including horizontal and vertical
transmission. Transovarial transmission is a subset/type of vertical
transmission adopted by mosquitoes for the transmission of viruses from
females to their offspring through eggs/ovaries. It provides a mechanism
for these MBVs to persist and maintain their lineage during adverse
climatic conditions of extremely hot and cold temperatures, during the
dry season, or in the absence of susceptible vertebrate host when
horizontal transmission is not possible.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
The publications discussed in this systematic review were searched for
using the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, and websites
such as those of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European
Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, using the search terms
“transovarial transmission” and “mosquito-borne viruses” from 16 May
2023 to 20 September 2023.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
A total of 2,391 articles were searched, of which 123 were chosen for
full text evaluation, and 60 were then included in the study after
screening and removing duplicates.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
The present systematic review focuses on understanding the above
diseases, their pathogenesis, epidemiology and host–parasite
interactions. The factors affecting transovarial transmission, potential
implications, mosquito antiviral defense mechanism, and the control
strategies for these mosquito-borne viral diseases (MBVDs) are also be
included in this review.

impact of Helicobacter pylori infection on low skeletal muscle mass risk
in Chinese women over 40: a cross-sectional analysis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Sarcopenia can lead to significant personal, social, and economic
burdens. The diagnosis of sarcopenia heavily relies on the
identification of Low Skeletal Muscle Mass (LSMM), which is an
independent predictor of frailty, disability, and increased risk of
death among seniors. Women have physiologically lower levels of skeletal
muscle mass than men, and female sarcopenia appears to be more
influenced by menopause. They also tend to have higher body fat levels
than man, which increases the risk of sarcopenia obesity. On another
front, it’s also recognized that humans are largely prone to
<italic>Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)</italic> infection, with global
prevalence rates often surpassing 50%. Nevertheless, the interconnection
between <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection and LSMM remains relatively
unexplored. Hence, our study specifically targeted women as the research
population and sought to explore several risk factors for LSMM.
Additionally, we delved into the potential correlation between LSMM and
<italic>H. pylori</italic> infection in women, hoping to gain insights
into potential preventative measures or treatment options that may
enhance the quality of life for women affected by sarcopenia.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
We conducted a cross-sectional study among women aged over 18 years
undergoing physical examination. We performed 13C-urea breath test (UBT)
for diagnosis of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection and Bioelectrical
impedance analysis (BIA) for the assessment of LSMM. Logistic regression
models were used to analyze the associations of <italic>H.
pylori</italic> infection with LSMM.

This study enrolled 1984 Chinese women who were undergoing health
check-ups. A univariate logistic regression analysis did not reveal a
direct correlation between <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection and LSMM
among this female population (OR=1.149, 95% CI 0.904-1.459,
<italic>p</italic>=0.257). Yet, upon dividing the participants into
age-based subgroups, an evident link was observed between <italic>H.
pylori</italic> infection and LSMM in women aged 40 or above (OR=1.381,
95%CI 1.032-1.848, <italic>p</italic>= 0.030). After adjusting for
variables including Age, BMI, TP, ALK, Cre, this relationship remained
statistically relevant (OR=1.514, 95%CI 1.085-2.113, <italic>p</italic>=
0.015).
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusions
</title>
<p>
Women who are over 40 years old and currently infected with <italic>H.
pylori</italic> have an increased risk of developing LSMM. Therefore,
timely treatment for <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication is
recommended for this group of women to reduce the occurrence of LSMM.

crosstalk of intratumor bacteria and the tumor</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
The in-depth studies reveal the interaction between the host and
commensal microbiomes. Symbiotic bacteria influence in tumor initiation,
progression, and response to treatment. Recently, intratumor bacteria
have been a burgeoning research field. The tumor microenvironment is
under vascular hyperplasia, aerobic glycolysis, hypoxia, and
immunosuppression. It might be attractive for bacterial growth and
proliferation. As a component of the tumor microenvironment, intratumor
bacteria influence tumor growth and metastasis, as well as the efficacy
of anti-tumor therapies. Therefore, understanding the intricate
interplay of intratumoral bacteria and the host might contribute to
better approaches to treat tumors. In this review, we summarize current
evidence about roles of intratumor bacteria in tumor initiation and
anti-tumor therapy, and what is remained to be solved in this field.

of Lactobacillus plantarum ZFM4 in Helicobacter pylori-infected C57BL/6
mice: prevention is better than cure</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-03, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Objectives
</title>
<p>
This study was performed to explore the preventive and therapeutic
effects of <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> ZFM4 on H. pylori
infections of the stomach tissue in C57BL/6 mice.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
In this study, 40 specific-pathogen-free female C57BL/6 mice were
randomly divided into five groups, namely, the control, ZFM4
pretreatment) ZFM4 pretreatment before <italic>H. pylori</italic>
infected), model (<italic>H. pylori</italic> infected), triple therapy
(<italic>H. pylori</italic> infected and treated with triple therapy),
and ZFM4 treatment groups (<italic>H. pylori</italic> infected and
treated with ZFM4). The preventive and therapeutic effects of
<italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> ZFM4 were evaluated in
<italic>H. pylori-</italic>infected C57BL/6 mice by assessing gastric
tissue morphology, inflammatory cytokine levels, microbial composition,
and microbial diversity.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
<italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> ZFM4 was able to survive in low
gastric pH and play a role in preventing <italic>H. pylori</italic>
infection. This was evident from a reduction in both, the gastric
inflammatory response and expression of inflammatory factors caused by
<italic>H. pylori</italic> infection. <italic>Lactobacillus
plantarum</italic> ZFM4 could also inhibit the growth of <italic>H.
pylori</italic> via its beneficial impact on the gastric microbiota.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Our findings suggest that <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> ZFM4
offers superior preventive effects against <italic>H. pylori</italic>
infections when used alone. However, the therapeutic effect on
established infections is weaker. Further clinical trials are needed to
confirm the specific dosage, duration, and other aspects of
administration.

Condemns Israeli Ministers’ Call for Palestinians to Emigrate</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The United States on Tuesday denounced controversial
comments by two Israeli ministers who said Palestinians should be
encouraged to emigrate from Gaza and for Jewish settlers to return to
the besieged territory.</p>
<p>State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Washington “rejects
recent statements from Israeli Ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben
Gvir advocating for the resettlement of Palestinians outside of
Gaza.”</p>
<p>“This rhetoric is inflammatory and irresponsible,” added Miller, who
reiterated the “clear, consistent, and unequivocal” U.S. position that
“Gaza is Palestinian land and will remain Palestinian land, with Hamas
no longer in control of its future and with no terror groups able to
threaten Israel.”</p>
<p>Ben Gvir, Israel’s firebrand national security minister, had called
on Monday for promoting “a solution to encourage the emigration of
Gaza’s residents.”</p>
<p>Israel unilaterally withdrew the last of its troops and settlers from
Gaza in 2005, ending a presence inside Gaza that began in 1967 but
maintaining near complete control over the territory’s borders.</p>
<p>The government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not
officially suggested it has any plans to evict Gazans or to send Jewish
settlers back to the territory since the current war broke out on
October 7.</p>
<p>But Ben Gvir argued that the departure of Palestinians and
re-establishment of Israeli settlements “is a correct, just, moral and
humane solution.”</p>
<p>“This is an opportunity to develop a project to encourage Gaza’s
residents to emigrate to countries around the world,” he told a meeting
of his ultranationalist Otzma Yehudit, or “Jewish Power,” party.</p>
<p>His comments came the day after Israel’s far-right Finance Minister
Smotrich also called for the return of settlers to Gaza, equally saying
Israel should “encourage” the territory’s 2.4 million Palestinians to
leave.</p>
<p>The bloodiest ever Gaza war was triggered by Hamas’ October 7 attacks
on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,200 people, most of
them civilians, according to Israel.</p>
<p>After the worst attack in its history, Israel began a relentless
bombardment and ground offensive that has killed at least 22,185 people,
mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Hamas-run health
ministry.</p>
<p>With heavy combat raging on, 85% of the people in the Gaza Strip have
been internally displaced, according to the United Nations.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-forked-steamos-for-my-living-room-pc">How I forked SteamOS
for my living room PC</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>SteamOS 3 (“Holo”) is the Arch-based Linux distribution built for the
Steam Deck, Valve Software’s portable PC gaming device. It’s a very
interesting Linux distribution even when you only focus on how it
updates itself: updates are performed atomically by downloading a new
read-only root filesystem to an inactive partition, then rebooting into
that partition. But consumers can also run steamos-devmode to unlock the
root filesystem, put the pacman database in working order, and give them
a working Linux distro with a normal package manager. This A/B atomic
updates system is pretty standard for OSes these days, but there’s a lot
going on in SteamOS that makes them work even with heavy customization
by the end-user. I wanted to explore that while still being able to make
changes to the root filesystem images. steamos-devmode is the easy way
out; I wanted to make a proper fork. Here’s how I did it. ↫ iliana
etaoin This article has sparked my interest to build a living room PC
for Steam gaming for my wife and I, so we can play couch coop Steam
games on an actual couch instead of behind our PC desk. Very detailed
and in-depth, this article also teaches a lot about how SteamOS works
under the hood.</p>

<h2
id="harvard-president-gay-resigns-after-rocky-testimony-plagiarism-allegations">Harvard
President Gay Resigns After Rocky Testimony, Plagiarism Allegations</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Harvard President Claudine Gay said she would resign
from her position on Tuesday, after her first months in the role were
rocked by her congressional testimony about antisemitism on campus and
allegations of plagiarism.</p>
<p>Gay had faced pressure to resign from Harvard’s Jewish community and
some members of Congress over her comments at the Dec. 5 congressional
hearing, and she has also faced several allegations of plagiarism for
her academic work in recent months.  </p>
<p>In a letter to the Harvard community, Gay said her decision to step
down had been “difficult beyond words.”</p>
<p>“After consultation with members of the Corporation, it has become
clear that it is in the best interests of Harvard for me to resign so
that our community can navigate this moment of extraordinary challenge
with a focus on the institution rather than any individual.”</p>
<p>The Harvard Corporation, the university’s 11-member governing body,
said in an email to the community that its members had accepted Gay’s
resignation “with sorrow.”</p>
<p>Gay, former University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill and
Massachusetts Institute of Technology President Sally Kornbluth
testified before a U.S. House of Representatives committee on Dec. 5
about a rise in antisemitism on college campuses following the outbreak
of the Israel-Hamas war in October.</p>
<p>The trio declined to give a definitive “yes” or “no” answer to
Republican Representative Elise Stefanik’s question as to whether
calling for the genocide of Jews would violate their schools’ codes of
conduct regarding bullying and harassment, saying they had to balance it
against free speech protections.</p>
<p>More than 70 U.S. lawmakers signed a letter demanding that the
governing boards of the three universities remove the presidents, citing
dissatisfaction with their testimony.</p>
<p>Magill resigned after receiving backlash for her comments.</p>
<p>“Harvard knows that this long overdue forced resignation of the
antisemitic plagiarist president is just the beginning of what will be
the greatest scandal of any college or university in history,”
Representative Stefanik said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Despite the controversy ensnaring Gay, the Harvard Corporation last
month reaffirmed its confidence that she could lead the school through a
period of high tension over the war in the Middle East. It also said an
independent review of Gay’s academic work found she had not committed
research misconduct. She has submitted several corrections for citation
errors in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Gay, who became the university’s first Black president six months
ago, and the members of the Harvard Corporation said in their letters to
the community on Tuesday that she had been subject to racist attacks.
 </p>
<p>Some of Gay’s critics, including billionaire hedge fund manager Bill
Ackman, have argued that she was chosen for the role as part of the
school’s effort to promote diversity rather than for her
qualifications.</p>
<p>Ackman could not immediately be reached for comment on Tuesday. He
reposted the Harvard Crimson’s story about Gay’s resignation on social
media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.</p>
<p>“It has been distressing to have doubt cast on my commitments to
confronting hate and to upholding scholarly rigor - two bedrock values
that are fundamental to who I am - and frightening to be subjected to
personal attacks and threats fueled by racial animus,” Gay said in her
statement.</p>
<p>The Harvard Corporation wrote that she had been subjected to “deeply
personal and sustained attacks” that included “racist vitriol directed
at her through disgraceful emails and phone calls.”</p>

The Department of Treasury
<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1379" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published</a>
<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2023-06822/section-30d-new-clean-vehicle-credit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new
rules</a> last year that will determine which new electric vehicles,
purchased for personal use, will qualify for
<a href="https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/credits-for-new-clean-vehicles-purchased-in-2023-or-after" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
$7,500 tax credit</a>. They went into effect on April 18, 2023, and last
for the next decade or so.
</p>
<p>
These new tax credit rules are complicated. The list of cars that
qualify for the new tax credit can change from year to year — and even
month to month. Many buyers in the EV market might have a few questions,
including: Should I buy that new car now, or should I wait? Which cars
qualify for the current tax credit, and which ones will earn the new
one?
</p>
<p>
This is Heatmap’s guide to the new tax credit, why it matters, and what
to keep in mind as you go EV shopping.
</p>
<h3>
Who is affected by these new rules?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
If you’re an ordinary American buying a brand-new EV to run errands and
pick up the kids, these new rules apply to you. They will determine
which cars you can get a federally funded discount on.
</p>
<p>
If you’re not buying a <em>new</em> car for <em>personal</em> use —
because you’re getting it for your business, say, or because you’re
buying a used EV — these new rules don’t apply to you. But you may
qualify for other new subsidies. We get into those below.
</p>
<p>
And even if you <em>are </em>in that first category, you may discover
it’s much cheaper to lease a new EV instead of buying it outright. We
get into why below, too.
</p>
<h3>
Why are these new rules important?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
They completely change how the United States approaches the EV industry.
</p>
<p>
During the Bush and Obama administrations, the U.S. was focused mostly
on getting automakers to begin to experiment with EVs. So it discounted
<a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409#vehicles-purchased-before-august-17-2022" target="_blank">the
first 200,000 or so electric vehicles</a> that each manufacturer sold by
up to $7,500. If a company had cumulatively sold more than that number
over time, as Tesla and General Motors eventually did, then the discount
expired. By 2022, that had led to a peculiar situation where foreign
automakers, such as Hyundai, could use the subsidy, while some of the
largest American automakers couldn’t.
</p>
<p>
Now, U.S. policy is focused on two goals: (1) building up a domestic
supply chain for EVs and (2) getting more EVs on the road. So the tax
break is completely uncapped — any automaker can use it as many times as
possible if they meet the criteria.
</p>
<p>
But many new requirements apply: Only cars that undergo final assembly
in North America will qualify for <em>any </em>of the tax credit. Then,
cars with a battery that was more than 50% made in North America will
qualify for a $3,750 subsidy. And cars where at least 40% of the
“critical minerals” used come from the U.S. or a country with whom we
have a free-trade agreement will qualify for another $3,750 subsidy.
</p>
<p>
Those percentage-based requirements will ramp up over time. By 2029, for
instance, 100% of a car’s battery and battery components must be made in
North America.
</p>
<h3>
Why is this change happening now?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
Because Congress said so. The Inflation Reduction Act, which Democratic
majorities in the House and Senate passed last year, mandated this
change to the EV tax credit as part of its broad expansion of American
climate policy.<span></span><br/>
</p>
<h3>
Will more EVs or fewer EVs qualify for a subsidy under those new rules?
</h3>
<br>
<p>
Initially, fewer EVs will receive a subsidy under the new rules, Biden
officials say. On a press call with reporters, a senior Treasury
official argued that more cars will eventually qualify under the new
rules than qualified under the old ones.
</p>
<h3>
Which EVs will qualify under the new rules in 2024?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
This year, at least 14 car or light trucks will receive some or all of
the credit. Only some of those vehicles will qualify for the full $7,500
tax credit; some will qualify for a partial $3,750 tax credit. Here is
the full list of qualifying models, along with the amount of the tax
credit that they will earn:
</p>
<p>
• Chevrolet Bolt ($7,500)<br/>• Chevrolet Bolt EUV ($7,500)<br/>•
Chrysler Pacifica PHEV ($7,500)<br/>• Ford Escape Plug-in Hybrid
($3,750)<br/>• Ford F-150 Lightning, Standard &amp; Extended Range
($7,500)<br/>• Jeep Wrangler PHEV 4xe ($3,750)<br/>• Jeep Grand Cherokee
PHEV 4xe ($3,750)<br/>• Lincoln Corsair Grand Touring ($3,750)<br/>•
Rivian R1S, Dual Large &amp; Quad Large ($3,750)<br/>• Rivian R1T, Dual
Large, Dual Max, &amp; Quad Large ($3,750)<br/>• Tesla Model X Long
Range ($7,500)<br/>• Tesla Model 3 Performance ($7,500)<br/>• Tesla
Model 3 Long Range AWD ($3,500)<br/>• Tesla Model Y AWD, Rear-Wheel
Drive, &amp; Performance ($7,500)<br/><span></span>
</p>
<p>
Some vehicles that earned the full tax credit in 2023, such as the Ford
Mustang Mach E or Volkswagen ID.4, don’t qualify for any benefit as of
January 2, 2024.
</p>
<h3>
Are there any EVs that definitely do not qualify for either tax credit?
</h3>
<br>
<p>
Yes. A few examples: The Hummer EV, which costs more than $110,000 a
piece, won’t qualify for either the new or old tax credit — it’s too
expensive. And the Polestar 2 won’t qualify because it’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/americans-are-willing-to-pay-more-to-reject-chinese-evs?draft=1" target="_self">assembled
in China</a>.
</p>
<h3>
Have there been any other recent changes to the EV tax credit? 
</h3>
<br>
<p>
Yes. Starting this year, the U.S. is preventing cars
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-tax-credit-china-rule-2024" target="_blank">that
receive too much manufacturing input</a> from a “foreign entity of
concern” — that is, China — from qualifying for <em></em>any<em> </em>of
the tax credit. This has reduced the number of vehicles that qualify for
the $7,500 bonus.
</p>
<p>
This year, the government will also allow buyers
<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/EV-Tax-Credit-FAQs.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to
refund their EV tax credit at the dealership</a>. That means buyers can
now get up to a $7,500 discount at the moment when they buy their car
instead of waiting until they file their taxes in the following year.
</p>
<h3>
Are there any income caps on the $7,500 tax credit?
</h3>
<br>
<p>
Yes. A married couple must have an adjusted gross income of less than
$300,000 a year, and a single filer must have an AGI of less than
$150,000 a year, to qualify for any aspect of the subsidy. A
head-of-household must have an income of less than $225,000 a year.
</p>
<h3>
Lots of rules! Is there a price limit on the EVs that can qualify for
this new subsidy?
</h3>
<br>
<p>
Yes. Under the proposed rule, cars must have an MSRP below $55,000 to
qualify for the credit. Vans, pickup trucks, and SUVs must have an MSRP
below $80,000.
</p>
<h3>
If my household makes more than that, do I have any other options?
</h3>
<br>
<p>
Yes. The Inflation Reduction Act also included a new $7,500 tax credit
for EVs used for any commercial purpose. The Treasury Department is
<em>expected </em>to interpret that provision to cover leasing, but it
hasn’t announced the guidelines for that rule yet, so we don’t know for
sure.
</p>
<p>
But the provision will probably tilt new EV drivers toward leasing their
car rather than buying it outright, because the dealer should — emphasis
on <em>should —</em> offer relative discounts on leasing vehicles as
compared to buying them.
</p>
<h3>
There’s no way I can afford a new EV. Does the IRA contain any subsidies
for buying a used EV?
</h3>
<br>
<p>
Yes. There’s also
<a href="https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/used-clean-vehicle-credit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
new $4,000 tax credit</a> for buying a used EV that costs $25,000 or
less. It went into effect on January 1, 2023, so you can go ahead and
use it today.
</p>
<p>
But note that it has even stricter income limits: Married couples can
only take advantage of it if they make $150,000 or less, and other
filers if they make $75,000 or less.
</p>
<h3>
Out of the curiosity, what models qualified for the $7,500 credit before
April 18?
</h3>
<br>
<p>
Here’s the list of cars that qualified for the $7,500 tax credit before
April 18, 2023,
<a href="https://fueleconomy.gov/feg/tax2023.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according
to the Department of Energy</a>.

</p>
<p>
** Only some BMW X5 xDrive45e vehicles qualify — it depends where the
car was made. Check the VIN or ask the dealership to confirm it was made
in North America before buying.

<h2 id="teslas-and-rivians-year-end-sales-are-messy">Tesla’s and
Rivian’s Year-End Sales Are Messy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-02, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p>
How is the electric car industry doing? It depends on how you ask the
question and who you ask it of.
</p>
<p>
Two leading U.S. companies — one a startup turned stalwart, the other
still trying to secure itself a foothold in the market — reported their
production and sales figures for the final three months of 2023. The
behemoth Tesla
<a href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-vehicle-production-deliveries-and-date-financial-results-webcast-fourth-quarter-2023" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">delivered
484,507</a>, besting expectations,
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-02/rivian-s-fourth-quarter-ev-deliveries-fall-short-of-estimates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according
to <em>Bloomberg</em></a>. Rivian, the newcomer,
<a href="https://rivian.com/newsroom/article/rivian-releases-fourth-quarter-2023-financial-results" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">delivered
13,972</a> cars over the same time period, missing estimates by a hair.
The stock market response tells the rest of the story: Rivian shares
were down around 10% in morning trading Tuesday, while Tesla shares are
basically flat.
</p>
<p>
While the more-than-30-times difference is scale is obvious, the two
companies’ numbers serve as snapshots of both the promise and peril of
auto electrification as we roll into 2024. EVs are a real business, in
which Tesla is a large but no longer dominant player.
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/elon-musk-tesla-poll-ev-buyers" target="_blank">Elon
Musk’s company</a> has slipped into the number two slot behind China’s
BYD. Rivian, meanwhile, is not just competing with Tesla to sell
electric vehicles in the United States, but also with legacy automakers
who have ramped up their electric vehicle businesses to the tune of
<a href="https://prospect.org/infrastructure/transportation/2024-01-02-electric-vehicle-transition-surging-ahead/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter" target="_blank">about
10% of the American car market</a>.
</p>
<p>
For Tesla, everything now is about scale — how it can pump out as many
(increasingly competitively priced) cars to snare the average car
buyer’s dollar. Rivian is at a different stage of its evolution, more
reminiscent of the
<a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/05/tesla-profit-q1-2013/" target="_blank">Tesla
of more than a decade ago</a>. The company still loses a staggering
amount of money on every car it sells (although that figure is
narrowing) and
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=zeitlin+heatmap+rivian&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS940US940&oq=zeitlin+heatmap+rivian&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRigAdIBCDMwNDhqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">competes<strong></strong>
in a defined sector that Tesla has notably declined to directly play in:
full-size luxury trucks and SUVs</a>. And on another worrying note,
while Rivian’s full-year production numbers came in more than 3,000
vehicles over its own guidance,
<a href="https://stories.rivian.com/q3-2023" target="_blank">its fourth
quarter deliveries were short of the third quarter’s 15,564
deliveries</a>.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>While the challenge for Tesla is to sell as many cars as it
can,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/rivian-ceo-rj-scaringe-r2" target="_self">the
challenge for Rivian</a> is to navigate the most dangerous part of a new
car company’s growth — not the early days of using investor money to
develop a new vehicle, but the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-news-tesla-cybertruck-ford-gm" target="_blank">next
stage</a>, where you have an actual car to sell but you have to figure
out a way to make money doing it.
</p>
<p>
<em>Editor’s note: This article has been updated to correct the
difference in scale between Tesla and Rivian deliveries. We regret the
error.</em><br/>

The good news for Tether is shown in this graph, with two huge surges in
“market cap” this year. One of about $15B early in the year, and another
of about $6B recently. It looks like the euphoria over the prospect of

Bitcoin has gone from about $16K at the start of the year to around $42K
recently. Ethereum has merely doubled, from about $1.2K to about
$2.4K.<br /> <br /> So all is well with the world; Tether gets to keep
the interest on another $20B, which at say 4% is an extra $800M/year on
their bottom line, and the Bitcoin HODL-ers see their
<strike>investment</strike> gamble return a 160% gain. Is all really
well with the world? Follow me below the fold.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> Did hordes of retail
<strike>investors</strike> gamblers really send $20B in cash to Tether?
No, because Tether only deals with authorized institutions, and only in
amounts over $100K, Did institutions send Tether $20B in cash? It seems
unlikely. At various times over its history Tether has been caught
minting USDT in return for things other than cash, such as loans to
mysterious Chinese companies, or even thin air. It has never been
audited, and has been described as being
“<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-07/crypto-mystery-where-s-the-69-billion-backing-the-stablecoin-tether">practically
quilted out of red flags</a>”. Matt Levine
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-10-31/bad-passwords-are-securities-fraud">says</a>
“I feel like eventually Tether is going to be an incredibly interesting
story, but I still don’t know what it is.”<br /> <br /> Part of the
story was revealed by Dirty Bubble Media in
<a href="https://www.dirtybubblemedia.com/p/tethers-secret-agent"><i>Tether’s
Secret Agent</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
When people talk about the leaders of Tether, a few names typically
occupy the conversation. Paolo Ardoino, recently promoted from CTO to
CEO of the company, is the public face of Tether on Twitter and in the
media. Giancarlo Devasini, the failed plastic surgeon, then failed
software pirate, now billionaire CFO (how’s that for a career
trajectory?), is widely regarded as the de facto leader of the company.
And people often joke about Tether’s absentee former CEO, JL van der
Velde, asking whether he even exists (he does, and he also was a serial
failure before joining Tether).<br /> …<br /> We have been puzzled by
Tether’s leadership for some time. The massive success of the company
and the complexity of its operations seem beyond the abilities of a
small-time scam operator and repeat failure (Giancarlo), an
inexperienced and sweaty front man (Paolo), and another failed
businessman and absentee executive (JL). Notably, none of these guys had
any significant prior experience in finance, and it is unlikely that any
of them had the sorts of business and political ties that would be
essential for keeping a controversial company like Tether afloat.

But Dirty Bubble Media identifies
<a href="https://www.dirtybubblemedia.com/p/tethers-secret-agent">someone
else involved</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
His name is Christopher Charles Sherriff Harborne, AKA Chakrit
Sakunkrit. Styling himself a “digital nomad,” Mr. Harborne’s busy hands
reach across continents, industries, and political movements. The scope
of Mr. Harborne’s activities and the apparent wealth backing his
activities is staggering. Among those many diverse interests, it appears
that Tether has become one of his most important interests. And
Mr. Harborne has been far more than a passive investor in the company.
Indeed, the available evidence suggests that Mr. Harborne’s involvement
in Tether is far more significant than generally recognized…
</blockquote>
The details of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Harborne">Harborne</a>’s
career are
<a href="https://www.dirtybubblemedia.com/p/tethers-secret-agent">fascinating</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Mr. Harborne has major ownership interests in other notable companies.
Through a Delaware corporation he is the largest minority shareholder in
QinetiQ, a major British defense contractor; this stake is worth around
$200 million at present. He is also the sole owner of IFX Payments, a
British fintech company specializing in moving large sums of money
around the globe (hm). In total, over a dozen corporate entities spread
across the globe have been linked to Mr. Harborne, with many more likely
still hidden.
</blockquote>
He was a major funder of the
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/dec/30/britons-brexit-bad-uk-poll-eu-finances-nhs">disastrous
Brexit campaign</a> and the UK’s second
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/20/iceberg-lettuce-in-blonde-wig-outlasts-liz-truss">worst
recent Prime Minister</a>, Boris Johnson. He owns
“<a href="https://www.dirtybubblemedia.com/p/tethers-secret-agent">around
12% of Tether and a similar percentage of equity in Bitfinex</a>”. After
the
<a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-ends-virtual-currency-trading-platform-bitfinexs-illegal">Crypto
Capital Corp seizure</a> they lost access to the US banking system, and
Harborne was apparently
<a href="https://www.dirtybubblemedia.com/p/tethers-secret-agent">critical
to rescuing them both</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
He used his fuel-selling business AML Global to obtain an account with
the crypto-friendly Signature Bank. On the account application,
Mr. Harborne did not disclose his significant stake in Tether, nor did
he indicate the true purpose of the new account: It was intended to
serve as a backdoor for Bitfinex to access the U.S. banking system.
However, Signature caught on shortly thereafter and closed the
account.<br /> <br /> In other words, Mr. Harborne cared so deeply for
the fate of Bitfinex and Tether that he <b>risked the welfare of one of
his primary companies, and a <i>conviction for bank fraud</i></b>, to
try to save the company. It’s worth noting that Mr. Harborne received
some $70 million in Tether stablecoins over 2019, making him one of the
largest individual recipients of the token.
</blockquote>
With a cast of characters this sketchy, skepticism is warranted, and in

goes up! Can 5 billion unbacked tethers kickstart a fresh crypto
bubble?</i></a> Amy Castor and David Gerard supply some:<br />
<blockquote>
Bitcoin is over $44,000! In just the last week, the
<a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2022/04/10/the-national-posts-invisible-hand-society-nft-collection-the-facepalm-manifesto/">invisible
hand of the market</a> suddenly decided that bitcoins are really good
now!<br /> <br /> By complete coincidence, Tether has printed five
billion USDT stablecoins in the past month out of thin air as “loans” —
backed in the Tether reserve only by the “loans” themselves.<br />
<br /> How high can you pump a number with five billion fake dollars to
deploy?<br /> …<br /> In just one month, from November 5 to December 5,
Tether’s issuance climbed from 85 billion to 90 billion.<br />
</blockquote>
And the printer is still going. Molly White reports that
<a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/?id=tether-christmas-2023-mint"><i>Tether
mints itself a $1 billion Christmas present</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
On December 25, Tether minted 1 billion of its USDT dollar-pegged
stablecoin. CEO Paolo Ardoino announced on Twitter that the mint was an
“authorized but not issued transaction, meaning that this amount will be
used as inventory for next period issuance requests and chain swaps”.
This seems to be a recent trend for Tether, as similar language was used
for a $1 billion mint in September.<br /> <br /> The activity has raised
more questions around where the real money backing Tether is coming
from, and if it even exists at all. Some have argued that these recent
Tether mints are being used to artificially inflate the price of
Bitcoin, which has been on an upward trend since mid-October.

Amy Castor and David Gerard
<a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2023/12/06/bitcoin-goes-up-can-5-billion-unbacked-tethers-kickstart-a-fresh-crypto-bubble/">ask
the right question</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
You would think, with that kind of totally genuine and organic market
demand for stablecoins, USDC’s issuance would also be going up — but no.
USDC’s issuance is 24.4 billion, having seen a steady decrease from 44
billion in March 2023.<br /> <br /> So where is Tether getting all the
dollars to back these tethers?<br /> <br /> It isn’t. Tether’s printing
press is not fueled by demand. This is Tether issuing loans to some of
its biggest customers — printing pseudo-dollars out of thin air, with
the only “backing” being the loan itself, counted as an asset. The loans
are secured by cryptos held as collateral — not as reserves. No actual
dollars flow into the system this way.<br />
</blockquote>
Why would crypto-bros prefer USDT to USDC if it is doubtful that it is
fully backed? It might have something to do with USDT lacking
“regulatory clarity”. How do we know Tether is printing USDT out of thin
air?
<a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2023/12/06/bitcoin-goes-up-can-5-billion-unbacked-tethers-kickstart-a-fresh-crypto-bubble/">Because</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Tether spent years denying that they issued tethers from thin air as
loans — then Alex Mashinsky of Celsius Network confirmed in October 2021
that Celsius had been taking out such loans from Tether. It came out in
the
<a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2021/10/29/the-cftc-settlement-with-tether-and-bitfinex-42-5-million-dollars-in-fines/">CFTC
settlement</a> later that month that they had been doing this precise
thing for a while.<br /> <br /> Tether admitted in September that it was
making “secured” loans again — after saying in December 2022 that it
would reduce its secured loans to zero.
[<a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/tether-is-lending-its-stablecoins-again-b11705f2">WSJ</a>]
</blockquote>
Presumably, during the “crypto winter”, there would have been a need for
customers to exchange USDT for USD. But
<a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2023/12/06/bitcoin-goes-up-can-5-billion-unbacked-tethers-kickstart-a-fresh-crypto-bubble/">did
they?</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In mid-2022, after
<a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2022/05/10/terras-stablecoin-does-a-2008-crisis-ust-crashes-and-takes-bitcoin-with-it/">the
Terra-Luna collapse</a>, Tether
<a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2022/06/13/celsius-goes-fahrenheit-451-and-number-goes-down/">bragged</a>
that it had
<a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2022/06/22/crypto-collapse-latest-the-contagion-spreads/">“redeemed”
16 billion USDT</a>. We would assume most or all of that was loans being
canceled and the tethers burned. We certainly don’t know of any
independently verifiable evidence that a single actual dollar was
transferred in return.<br /> <br /> For comparison, USDC reserves are
held in short-term treasuries and cash in US bank accounts. A USDC
appears to have an actual dollar backing it — and now that interest
rates are up, Circle has been making a ton of money.<br /> <br /> If
Tether had billions of real dollars backing its tethers — as it claims —
then the folks running Tether could also make a ton of money simply by
putting the reserve into Treasury bills. They do not need to be making
loans.<br /> <br /> In late 2022, CZ from Binance was deeply upset that
Sam Bankman-Fried from FTX might destabilize tethers by
<a href="https://amycastor.com/2022/12/18/crypto-collapse-binance-is-not-so-fine-ftx-delaware-vs-ftx-bahamas-celsius-voyager-gemini-tether/">trying
to cash out … $250,000 worth</a>. That’s out of a supposed reserve in
the <i>billions</i>. This brings into serious question how many actual
dollars are anywhere near Tether — clearly not enough.
</blockquote>
What is going on has similarities with Celsius’
<a href="https://celsius.network/cel-token-explained">“flywheel”</a>.
<a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2023/12/06/bitcoin-goes-up-can-5-billion-unbacked-tethers-kickstart-a-fresh-crypto-bubble/">Castor
and Gerard explain</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Crypto institutions — exchanges, hedge funds — use the tethers to buy
leverage and pump the price. They post their inflated crypto as
collateral to borrow more USDT and keep pumping.
[<a href="https://www.dirtybubblemedia.com/p/examining-tethers-secret-loan-portfolio">Dirty
Bubble</a>]
</blockquote>
These crypto-backed loans are the fuel for the pump inflating the
cryptocurrency bubble.
<a href="https://www.dirtybubblemedia.com/p/examining-tethers-secret-loan-portfolio">Dirty
Bubble Media concludes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Based on the current dataset, we can estimate that Tether issued many
billions of USDT backed by crypto collateral. The impact is far larger
than one might assume just from looking at the loan balances. For
example, Tether lent Celsius Network just over $4 billion in total. Our
data indicates that other parties like Amber and 3AC similarly received
billions in loans, which round-tripped their way through the
crypto-conomy without ever touching the real financial system or ever
being backed by real money….<br /> <br /> Many questions remain
unanswered:<br />
<ul>
<li>
What percentage of Tether’s “redemptions” are actually loan repayments?
</li>
<li>
What is the impact of cycling billions of crypto-backed USDT through the
crypto markets?
</li>
<li>
And, why did Tether’s reported secured loans massively diverge from this
data starting in May/June 2022, around the same time as Terra, Celsius
Network, and Three Arrows Capital collapsed?
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
US regulators have been suspicious of Tether for a long time, and they
<a href="https://amycastor.com/2023/12/28/crypto-collapse-mt-gox-payouts-tether-hooks-up-the-feds-sec-says-no-to-coinbase-crypto-media-mergers/">seem
to have lost patience</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The US government isn’t entirely happy with Tether’s financial
shenanigans. But they’re really unhappy about sanctions violations,
especially with what’s going on now in the Middle East. <br /> <br /> So
Tether has announced that it will now be freezing OFAC-sanctioned
blockchain addresses — and it’s onboarded the US Secret Service and FBI
onto Tether!

<a href="https://medium.com/chainargos/what-happens-when-tether-freezes-your-tether-5a8ece2bd508">concludes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The Victim’s transactions are at very most 3 hops away from known bad
actors, so it’s not entirely unreasonable for Indian authorities to
require more information and detailed documents, not to mention the
backdrop of ongoing scams abusing already stretched Indian law
enforcement agencies.<br /> <br /> For Tether’s part, it looks as though
they received a request from Indian law enforcement and followed
it.<br /> <br /> But perhaps, and somewhat more significantly, there is
also the risk that Tether blacklists the USDT in your wallet, in
response to government requests, regardless if those requests are lawful
or not.<br /> <br /> It’s entirely possible for government officials or
authorities with a personal vendetta, to target causes, or political
opponents who receive donations or are known to transact in USDT, and
for Tether to err on the side of caution and comply.<br /> <br /> It’s
entirely possible that many “innocent” addresses are blacklisted in such
opaque processes, collateral damage in purges.
</blockquote>
<p>The Victim might well be collateral damage, but it was essentially
impossible to supply the “more information and detailed documents” that
law enforcement required to lift the freeze. Such are the risks of
operating without “regulatory clarity”. But the kind of “regulatory
clarity” the US has imposed on Tether isn’t likely to help The Victim or
others who become collateral damage, it is likely to increase their
numbers. An increasing number of users unable to access their funds is a
double-edged sword for Tether; the good news is that Tether gets to keep
the interest on frozen funds, the <i>good</i> news is that more and more
people figure out how risky USDT is.<br /> <br /></p>

women grapple with the Taliban’s university ban, one year on</h2>

<p>
The Taliban banned women from attending universities in Afghanistan in
December 2022, a move that the World Bank warns will hinder the
country’s prospects for economic growth. We’ll hear from three women who
share how the lack of educational opportunities has affected their
lives. Plus, the stock market opens for the year. And later: What we can

Ford F-150 Lightning. Under the new rules, cars that use battery
components made by Chinese manufacturers are disqualified, a move meant
to wean the U.S. market off the Chinese supply chain. And the
restrictions will become even tighter in 2025, targeting raw materials
like lithium. U.S. automakers are working to expand their domestic
manufacturing capabilities but this won’t happen overnight. In the
meantime, propsective EV owners could consider leasing rather than
buying, which will let you “skirt much of the red tape,”

<li>BYD closes in on Tesla’s global EV lead

<strong></strong>Tesla is expected to release its fourth quarter sales
figures today and the big question is whether it will hold onto its
position as the world’s top-selling EV maker. Yesterday Chinese
automaker BYD
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=04145d2eea&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a>
it had sold 526,409 fully electric vehicles in the final three months of
the year; analysts forecast Tesla’s sales to come in at around 483,200.
BYD has been closing in on Tesla for a while, and if it takes the top
spot, “it will be both a symbolic turning point for the EV market and
further confirmation of China’s growing clout in the global automotive
industry,”

the average global temperature for 2024 is forecast to be between 1.34
degrees and 1.58 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average. “We
expect two new global temperature record-breaking years in succession,
and, for the first time, we are forecasting a reasonable chance of a
year temporarily exceeding 1.5 °C,” says the Met Office’s Dr. Nick

<strong></strong>A rise in extreme weather and natural disasters in the
U.S. is prompting a big hike in so-called reinsurance rates, which is
likely to trickle down to propery insurance costs. As <em>Reuters</em>

“reinsurers provide insurance for insurers and the prices they agree at
the beginning of each year set the trend for the cost of insurance for
the next 12 months.” On January 1, U.S. property catastrophe reinsurance
rates jumped by as much as 50% for policies that previously experienced
natural disasters, according to broker Gallagher Re. The U.S.
experienced at least 25 climate-related weather disasters with losses
exceeding $1 billion last year,

is the best game to watch because you get to know the players. Only five
players on the court at once, they play both offense and defense, and
they aren’t wearing armor like football players, you see their faces,
whether they’re cool or hot, emotional or stoic, up or down. So when
your team trades two of its best-known players for three players you’ve
never heard of, to a team that’s rebuilding, first you feel sad, and
then you wonder what the new teams will be like. One of the traded
players,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Quickley">Immanuel
Quickley</a>, is a young, happy warrior with a deadly offense, but he
was a Knicks bench player because they already had an All-Star quality
player at his position, point guard, the quarterback of a basketball
team. He led the second unit, and probably had a lot to do with the
Knicks’ success last year. I watched the Raptors game last night, and
while the joy seemed to be gone from his demeanor, he was their starting
point guard, and now he gets a chance to prove himself. The Knicks got
something they needed, desperately, now that their defensive leader,

never became the producer we hoped he would. The new Knicks starting
five are a much better team than they were before the trade, or so it

Given the research above, we assess a strong possibility that content on
TikTok is either amplified or suppressed based on its alignment with the
interests of the Chinese Government. Future research should aim towards
a more comprehensive analysis to determine the potential influence of
TikTok on popular public narratives. This research should determine if
and how TikTok might be utilized for furthering national/regional or
international objectives of the Chinese Government…

Are All Bad</h2>

<p class="drop-caps">
Suppose you’d never heard of the gas-powered car. One day, someone comes
along to evangelize a new Honda CR-V as the hottest thing in technology.
You might rightfully ask: <em>Are you serious? You want me to put my
family inside a box propelled by petroleum explosions? I’m supposed to
maintain a machine made of thousands of moving parts ready to fail at
any time, and that needs a fossil fuel imported largely from hostile
nations?</em>
</p>
<p>
Hank Green of YouTube fame recently posted such a thought experiment on
Threads to point out the power of the status quo. After a century of our
burning gasoline to get around, the frankly bizarre nature of internal
combustion has become invisible. Instead, it is the ascendant electric
car that is met by the doubt and derision that scoffs at anything new
and different.
</p>
<p>
I’m not going to tell you EVs don’t have growing pains. But the big
arguments against them
<a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/all-the-arguments-against-evs-are" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">aren’t
as impressive as they sound</a>.
</p>
<p>
Some anti-EV complaints are little more than bad-faith attacks drummed
up by petroleum partisans and others with an ax to grind against
electrification. For example, there is the notion that EVs aren’t
actually better for the climate because they produce more emissions than
gas cars. Opponents adore this one, since it would negate the rationale
for electrifying the car fleet.
</p>
<p>
Except, it’s wrong. It may be true that <em>building</em> an EV requires
slightly more upfront carbon emissions, which are caused by mining the
essential materials and making the battery. However, combustion cars
<a href="https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/are-electric-vehicles-definitely-better-climate-gas-powered-cars" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more
than make up the difference</a> by burning fossil fuels, and spewing a
constant stream of climate pollution, for as many years as they run.
Meanwhile, an EV gets cleaner and cleaner as the grid that supplies its
electricity adds more and more renewables to its makeup. You’d basically
have to burn nothing but coal for EVs to be worse over their lifespans.

What about the annoyance of EV ownership? Some antagonists suggest
driving electric is like using cloth diapers: an onerous, soul-sucking
inconvenience taken on for the sake of saving the planet. Don’t believe
it. EV life has its quirks, sure. On the other hand, I’ve covered the
numerous ways that
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/why-are-electric-cars-better" target="_self">EVs
are just plain better than gas cars</a>, which includes the impressive
zoom off the starting line, the ability to use your garage as a
refueling station, and much more.
</p>
<p>
Range anxiety, held up as a dealbreaker for some buyers considering an
EV, isn’t the problem you think it is. The fear is essentially nil for
people who can charge an EV at home: You’ll wake up each morning with 80
or 90 percent of battery capacity, which is more than enough for all
your daily driving needs. Finding a public charger is mainly a problem
for longer trips, and the growing number of fast-charging stations means
there’ll be one. Furthermore, battery ranges are getting longer and
charging times are getting shorter. As this trend continues, range
anxiety is quickly diminishing, as is the convenience difference between
gas and electric.
</p>
<p>
Some naysayers say it’s impossible for an electric vehicle to meet their
needs. I get it. It’d be easy to look at
<a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/find/nearest?fuel=ELEC" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">maps</a>
of U.S. charging infrastructure and conclude that if you don’t live in
one of the big metropolitan areas where plugs are abundant, then EV
ownership is impossible or impractical. Well, not necessarily.
</p>
<p>
Yes, those who reside in truly rural parts of America, and drive many
miles far from the interstate highway system, ought to wait on going
electric. But you don’t need to live in Los Angeles to live with an EV.
Remember, if you can charge at home, then your house supplies the energy
for the vast majority of your driving. Fast chargers now line the major
highways even in states with low EV ownership to date, so you could
drive a long distance as long as it’s not into the hinterlands. Having
an EV especially makes sense in a two-car family where the other car is,
say, a traditional hybrid. Simply accomplish most of your local driving
on cleaner, electric power, and take out the Prius if you’re driving to
a far-flung national park.
</p>
<p>
EVs are too expensive, they say. That one is true. However, while the
federal tax credits for electric vehicles were already perplexing and
are
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-tax-credit-china-rule-2024" target="_self">getting
worse</a>, they exist. If you can manage to navigate them, it is still
possible to save $7,500 up front on buying an EV, an amount that brings
them much closer to their gasoline counterparts. And that’s before the
credits and rebates
<a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/state" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">available
in many states</a> for buying zero-emissions cars or installing home
charging stations. It also doesn’t include the savings from reduced
routine maintenance and low fuel costs, both of which make electrics
cheaper to operate as the years go by.
</p>
<p>
In addition, those high sticker prices won’t stay high forever. A lot of
the EVs that have hit the market so far are high-end, and their
eye-popping MSRP helps carmakers cover the costs of designing new
all-electric platforms and building big batteries. As the electric
market matures, more entry-level models will emerge, made possible in
part by the cost of batteries falling as the industry reaches a bigger
scale.
</p>
<p>
There is a long list of alleged reasons why electrification supposedly
cannot work across an entire country or the world. Among them:
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/01/do-electric-cars-have-problem-mining-for-minerals" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Battery
materials</a> are scarce, and must be mined in problematic areas. The
grid supposedly can’t handle the extra demand
(<a href="https://advocacy.consumerreports.org/research/blog-can-the-grid-handle-evs-yes/#:~:text=A%20question%20that%20frequently%20comes,a%20little%20bit%20of%20math." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it
can</a>), and we can’t put enough renewable energy on the grid for EVs
to make a maximum climate impact. Charging infrastructure is woefully
inadequate.
</p>
<p>
These all are issues to be sorted, surely. The fundamental problem with
this kind of anti-electric rhetoric around them, though, is that it
suggests such problems are unsolvable. They’re not. New sources for raw
materials are being found, such as the giant lithium deposit
<a href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/lithium-discovery-in-us-volcano-could-be-biggest-deposit-ever-found/4018032.article" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">discovered</a>
this year near the Oregon-Nevada border. The ascendant EV battery
recycling has the potential to recover most of the precious metals from
spent cells. In the longer term, scientists are at work on novel
chemistries that could use more abundant and easily obtained materials
to make the batteries of tomorrow from something other than lithium,
cobalt, and nickel.
</p>
<p>
The electricity grid does need to be improved, with more high-capacity
transmission lines and energy storage solutions to allow for saving
solar and wind energy for later. Frankly, though, our decaying
infrastructure needs hardening <em>anyway</em>, and the EV revolution
may help provide the push to get such projects past political gridlock.
In the meantime, there are available smart solutions such as trying to
line up energy demand with renewable supply — for example, by
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/every-office-should-have-an-electric-car-charger" target="_self">charging
all our new EVs in midday</a> when the sun is shining.
</p>
<p>
Maybe the people who say those solutions are too expensive or too
difficult simply have no vision. After all, many of them would be out
there stumping about the power of American ingenuity — if that ingenuity
were in pursuit of a technology that profited them or appealed to their
voters. While the EV transition will be hard, what would be even harder
is giving up and living with the effects of unmitigated climate change,
or trying to realize 11th-hour miracle solutions to save the planet like
direct air capture.
</p>
<p>
The only truly compelling argument against EVs is that they don’t go far
enough. They are still cars, after all, and a society that drives
electric cars still wastes its land on parking lots and kills thousands
of its citizens each year through crashes and collisions with other
vehicles, bikes, and pedestrians. Sticking with cars just because they
fit into the civilization we’ve built is a missed opportunity to build a
walkable, bikeable, better future. There’s no arguing with that one.

<h2 id="create-more.-consume-less.">Create more. Consume less.</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-02, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
I spend a lot of time online. One could argue it’s too much time. And in
that time, I consume content. Mountains of content. Huge mountains of
content. Maybe insurmountable mountains of content. No matter how much I
try, there will always be another interesting blog post, YouTube video,
or podcast episode. I consume a lot more than I create. I suspect I’m
not alone in this. And I think there’s a good balance to be found here.
Right now I feel the pendulum has swung too far in the direction of the
consumption and I have to bring it back towards the middle.
</p>
<p>
I feel that is something I need to do for myself, for the sake of my
mental sanity but I also think that’s something the internet as a whole
would benefit from. Consuming content online is, for the most part, a
mindless act. But creating content forces you to reflect, to introspect,
to look at yourself and the world around you in different ways.
</p>
<p>
More people <a href="https://ma.tt/2024/01/birthday-gift">should follow
Matt’s advice</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Publish a post. About anything! It can be long or short, a photo or a
video, maybe a quote or a link to something you found interesting. Don’t
sweat it. Just blog. Share something you created, or amplify something
you enjoyed. It doesn’t take much. The act of publishing will be a gift
for you and me.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think this is going to be my 2024 mantra: <em>Create more. Consume
less.</em>

ice cream, aged fish, Hanwoo beef: A food editor’s 16 best dishes of the
year</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-02, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Every year around this time, Google Trends releases its top searched recipes of the year. In 2023, there was a surprise: TikTok trends dominated the list as usual (lasagna soup, cottage cheese), but there was also a dish that will never again make an appearance on the list. It was Coronation Quiche, a cheesy, vegetarian number that celebrated Britain&amp;#8217;s newly crowned King Charles. That quiche might have flooded the internet this year, but I didn&amp;#8217;t have one bite of it. Even if I had, and even though I have a thing for cheese, it&amp;#8217;s highly doubtful that Coronation quiche would have made it onto my list of the best dishes I got to eat in 2023. I&amp;#8217;ve eaten in literally hundreds of restaurants and tasted a thousand dishes; now is my moment to look back. Last year, my theme was butter; this year, I gravitated towards birds, in particular a glorious, bacon-butter roasted chicken at Dovetale in 1 Hotel Mayfair in Central London. (It&amp;#8217;s been a great year to eat chicken &amp;#8212; shout out to the rotisserie options at Bebe Bob in London and whole roasted bird, at Sailor in Brooklyn, New York.) Meaty duck featured in exquisite stuffed pasta at another new hotel restaurant, Cafe Carmellini in New York, and also in an intense game bird sauce for pasta at a fantastic East Village joint, Foul Witch. Although in my job as a restaurant editor, I primarily focus on new and new-to-me dining spots, there are a couple innovative dishes on this list from established hangouts that had to feature on my roster. One of the very best came courtesy of chef James Lowe at Lyle&amp;#8217;s in London for a very delightful reason: Though he has been cooking for a couple decades, he hadn&amp;#8217;t served tuna. The fish &amp;#8220;is ubiquitous around the world, on menus everywhere. But it&amp;#8217;s the first time it&amp;#8217;s been fished off the coast in the UK since the 60s,&amp;#8221; he says. &amp;#8220;To be cooking for 20 years and all of a sudden have an ingredient I haven&amp;#8217;t cooked with, it&amp;#8217;s great fun.&amp;#8221; In fact, so unfamiliar was a whole tuna to the chef that he and his team had to watch YouTube videos to master the art of butchering a 200-plus kilo (more than 440 pound) fish, a procedure that took over five dining room tables the first time they tried it. The dish he settled on for the fall, while the fish was in season, was sublime tuna belly alongside a toast that was topped with fatty scrapings from the bones; you&amp;#8217;ll find more details below.&lt;/p&gt;

<h2 id="twenty-twenty-three">Twenty Twenty-Three</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-02, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
2023 has been a memorable year and –at times– downright existential.
Looking at the scorecard, it’s pretty clear there’s been more downs than
ups. Despite everything, I maintain a positive outlook and am
forward-looking.
</p>
<p>
I’m happy to report that I failed at all
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2022/12/twenty-twenty-two/">my SMART
goals from 2022</a>. Every. Single. One. Zero KPIs were harmed during
the course of the last year. Running a quick postmortem, I think setting
goals like this is stupid now. That said, I love data. So as I wrap up
this year, I’ll start with the quantifiable outcomes and move into the
less quantifiable aspects of 2023…
</p>
<h2>
Fell short in the books department
</h2>
<p>
I read or listened to 39 books this year which means I officially fell
out of the “Book-A-Week” club and I’m glad about that outcome. Rather
than powering through an endless backlog, I took a more one-in/one-out
approach with the library. I feel like I got more enjoyment out of the
books I picked up this year by taking it slower.
</p>
<p>
I had a goal of reading four Japanese language manga but failed at that.
I started two (<em>Delicious in Dungeon</em> and <em>Mobile Suit Gundam:
Cucuruz Doan’s Island</em>) but got hung up on cooking and military
vocabulary. Japanese has always been like that for me, it takes a lot to
load the “domain” into my Brain RAM. With some effort this may be
something I can re-pick up in 2024.
</p>
<p>
I planned to read less in 2023, so I guess I succeeded there. I had
another goal of watching more TV, but that didn’t happen. I watched some
anime (Gundam) so perhaps I qualified but I didn’t keep track. I also
switched from audiobooks to catching up on podcasts. No regrets.
</p>
<h2>
The year of the personal website
</h2>
<p>
I wrote ~70 blog posts this year between my blog and the Luro blog.
That’s not a good year… that’s my best year yet! And I have 39 drafts in
the hopper. My short term goal is to push publish on half of them. But
let’s look back at some of the greatest hits from this year.

And it’s not just a good year of blogging for me, I can feel the
resurgence of blogging in my bones.
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/07/one-friend-a-day/">I cleared out
over 2000 items in my RSS queue</a> and there’s 500 more unreads in
there again. If I were running a clandestine XML-based social network,
then I bet the number of people in that club would have tripled this
year. More people blogging on their personal sites makes the web feel
small and
<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-commentary/internet-future-about-to-get-weird-1234938403/">weird
again</a>, like walking through a friendly neighborhood as opposed to
being under the florescent lights of a giant shopping mall.
</p>
<p>
It will be interesting to see what happens with websites in 2024 and
beyond. We’re at a weird tipping point for the web where ChatGPT makes
it trivial to flood the internet with disingenuous, cheaply generated
content spam. What’s the point of writing if a machine can bullshit
faster than I can? Why would I put effort into reading that which you
didn’t put effort into writing? Did you hear that story about the male
conference organizer who was also a fake dev influencer e-girl? Big
yikes.
</p>
<p>
I wonder if the “personal” part of personal websites is the difference
maker going forward. I’m more apt to share something written by someone
I know than some AI content farm.

<h2>
A year of emergencies, loss, maladies, and stress
</h2>
<p>
We hit the deductible on our health insurance this year and I think
that’s a perfect metaphor for 2023. A brief chronological recounting of
this year’s trauma…
</p>
<ul>
<li>
(Feb) <a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/02/vibe-check-25/">Austin
froze again</a> - 125 hours without power. Thankful for friends who
housed us and helped us chainsaw branches.
</li>
<li>
(Apr) <a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/04/goodbye-rudy/">Goodbye,
Rudy</a> - Our sweet dog crossed the rainbow bridge.

(Apr) An emergency appendectomy - As family boarded a plane to visit us,
an appendix decided to leave town. Thanks to Mark, our friend, who
performed the surgery.
</li>
<li>
(May) Back-to-back-to-back-to-back cases of strep - Thank you, public
school system.
</li>
<li>
(May) Stress attack - Ack! Began
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/10/the-plan-and-the-plateau/">dieting</a>
and trying to relax.
</li>
<li>
(Sept) Root canal to kill a jaw-eating bacteria in tooth - No more
purple tooth!
</li>
<li>
(Sept) Diagnosing a mysterious foot fungus - Not fungus, Disney rash.
</li>
<li>
(Oct) Physical therapy and an MRI for a herniated L4 - Back pain is the
dumbest pain
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Managing stress and losing weight was my big personal focus this year.
It feels good to lose 30 pounds, but it feels even better to lower my
resting heart rate 10+ BPM. Being on a “no fun” diet for 7+ months is
good for me but contributes to a feeling of a boring year. I’ll take
that trade I guess or sell a kidney so I can afford Ozempic.
</p>
<h2>
The Good Parts
</h2>
<p>
2023 wasn’t all bad vibes! Some notable and good events happened this
year…
</p>
<ul>
<li>
My wife and I celebrated 15 years of marriage.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/08/vibe-check-28/">Vacationed in
San Diego</a> with friends and family.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/07/my-dad-recliner/">I got a

</li>
<li>

Web components are having a moment and I like web components.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/596/">ShopTalk wrapped our 12th
year</a> and we’ll hit Episode 600 in a few weeks.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
What made this year were the small moments that don’t make the “Year in
Review” lists. Like watching my son play baseball, or my daughter master
new cheer skills, the jokes and tickles, playing Christmas songs on the
piano, building the occasional plastic model, or playing games with the
family. Those are the moments that make up the majority of my days.
</p>
<h2>
🔮 What’s in store for 2024…
</h2>
<p>
2024 is gearing up to be a year of big changes, hopefully with less
medical surprises… but it’s New Year’s Day and I already know that’s not
the case. Ughck. Nevertheless, we persist. For me it’s a season of
reassessing, reprioritizing, and rethinking my personal goals. What do I
want for ol’ Dave Rupert and how do I get there? Not an easy question to
ask myself, but worthwhile.
</p>
<p>
Since I failed at quantifiable goals, I’m not doing those again. Here’s
what I have on my brain that would make for a successful 2024.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Activate an active lifestyle</strong> - I addressed a lot of
stress and weight loss this past year, I’d like to layer in sustainable
activity as well.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Write more shitty sci-fi</strong> - I have about six stories on
deck and I’d love to complete them.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Draw more</strong> - I’d love to be someone who doodles all the
time. I could be that guy.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Write for other publications</strong> - I’m comfortable with
self-publishing on my blog and I’d like to up the editorial challenge
this year by writing for other sites or zines.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Survive the 2024 US Election</strong> - This will occupy enough
mental bandwidth that I am reserving space for it.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Make a video game?</strong> - Always chasing this dream.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
That seems like a year’s worth of ambition right there and a good place
to end this retrospective. Tired, weak, and worn; I hope this year is
better for you than the last and that those around you are happy and
healthy.

Protest Restricts Access to NYC Airport’s International Terminal</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Access to a busy terminal at New York’s John F. Kennedy
International Airport was restricted Monday as pro-Palestinian
protesters converged on the airport for the second time in a week.</p>
<p>Videos posted online show heavy traffic and a slow-moving line of
cars, some flying Palestinian flags and featuring text on the windows
such as “Stop the genocide.” Police directed a line of cars around a
checkpoint. Protesters also had planned to arrive at the airport in
Queens, New York, by public transportation.</p>
<p>The New Year’s Day action was the latest in a series of protests
around the nation calling for a cease-fire since the Israel-Hamas war
began on Oct. 7. Last Wednesday, activists brought traffic to a
standstill on an expressway leading up to JFK for about 20 minutes.
Protesters shut down a major thoroughfare leading to the Los Angeles
International Airport on the same day.</p>
<p>Entry into JFK’s Terminal 4 was temporarily restricted Monday
afternoon to ticketed passengers, employees and people with what
authorities consider a valid reason to be there, such as passenger
pickups, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey,
which operates the region’s airports. </p>
<p>Similarly, AirTrain access was temporarily restricted to ticketed
passengers and employees.</p>
<p>“The Port Authority, in coordination with our local, state, and
federal partners, has deployed safety and security measures to help
ensure an uninterrupted travel experience at JFK,” port authority
spokesperson Seth Stein said in an email.</p>
<p>The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey didn’t report any
arrests.</p>
<p>City officials had warned people flying out of JFK on Monday, a busy
travel day, to get to the airport early because of the protests.</p>
<p>Police said the caravan of cars was later headed to protest outside
LaGuardia Airport, which is also in Queens.</p>

Rose Parade Boasts Floral Floats, Sunny Skies as California Tradition
Kicks Off New Year</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>pasadena, california — Floral floats, marching bands and equestrian
units took to the streets under a sunny California sky as the 135th Rose
Parade drew hundreds of thousands of spectators on New Year’s Day.</p>
<p>The Pasadena tradition on Monday featured Broadway legend Audra
McDonald as grand marshal and the theme “Celebrating a World of Music:
The Universal Language.”</p>
<p>After recent rains and gray skies, there was plenty of sun for the 8
a.m. start of the spectacle with a military flyover of a B-2 stealth
bomber.</p>
<p>Among the fanciful floats was Kaiser Permanente’s colorful “Symphony
of You,” which featured 8,000 roses and received the President Award for
most outstanding use and presentation of flowers.</p>
<p>The top prize, the 2024 Sweepstakes Trophy, went to the San Diego Zoo
for the 16.8-meter float “It All Started With a Roar,” depicting its
mascot Rex the Lion and celebrating wildlife conservation.</p>
<p>Huge crowds lined the 8.8-kilometer parade route. Many camped out on
sidewalks overnight, staking out their spots in the afternoon on New
Year’s Eve.</p>
<p>The parade was briefly interrupted by about 50 pro-Palestinian
protesters carrying a banner demanding a cease-fire in the war between
Israel and Hamas. They blocked the route before peacefully dispersing
under police orders, said city spokesperson Lisa Derderian.</p>
<p>McDonald was set to toss the coin before the 110th Rose Bowl college
football game between Alabama and Michigan.</p>

North American Hockey League Launches</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Montreal — Women’s ice hockey kicked off 2024 with the launch of a
new professional league that debuted Monday with a match between the
Toronto and New York teams.</p>
<p>The Professional Women’s Hockey League “rings in the New Year with
the very first regular season game in league history,” the PWHL said in
a press release.</p>
<p>Toronto earned the first victory in the new league, beating New York
4-0 in Toronto.</p>
<p>The regular season includes more than 20 games and runs until May,
and will be followed by playoffs.</p>
<p>The league has six teams: Boston, Minnesota and New York on the
American side, and Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto on the Canadian
side.</p>
<p>Ice hockey is Canada’s national winter sport but remains largely
dominated by men.</p>

countries.</p>
