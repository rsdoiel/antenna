<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: Rachel Kwon blog</p>
<p>I recently got contact lenses, for the first time in 34 years, as
someone who has required corrective eyewear since the age of 6. I have
attributed the decision mostly to my ongoing midlife/existential crisis
— as a way to prove to myself that I’m NOT set in my ways and I CAN do
new things — and for whatever reason I had increasingly been thinking
that my eyeglasses are my whole personality and I was interested in
experimenting with a different look.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago everyone was arguing about “founder mode”, but before
it came the idea of “Peace time CEO/War time CEO”. The removal of the
unnecessary violence in the metaphor is an improvement, but the content
of peacetime/wartime is actually better. It’s more specific, and more
about operating with focus and efficiency. Founder mode […]</p>

id="microsoft-maintains-its-own-windows-debloat-scripts-on-github">Microsoft
maintains its own Windows debloat scripts on GitHub</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s no secret that a default Windows installation is… Hefty. In more
ways than one, Windows is a bit on the obese side of the spectrum, from
taking up a lot of disk space, to requiring hefty system requirements
(artificial or not), to coming with a lot of stuff preinstalled not
everyone wants to have to deal with. As such, there’s a huge cottage
industry of applications, scripts, modified installers, custom ISOs, and
more, that try to slim Windows down to a more manageable size. As it
turns out, even Microsoft itself wants in on this action. The company
that develops and sells Windows also provides a Windows debloat script.
Over on GitHub, Microsoft maintains a repository of scripts simplify
setting up Windows as a development environment, and amid the collection
of scripts we find RemoveDefaultApps.ps1, a PowerShell script to
“Uninstall unnecessary applications that come with Windows out of the
box”. The script is about two years old, and as such it includes a few
applications no longer part of Windows, but looking through the list is
a sad reminder of the kind of junk Windows comes with, most notably
mobile casino games for children like Bubble Witch and March of Empires,
but also other nonsense like the Mixed Reality Portal or Duolingo. It
also removes something called “ActiproSoftwareLLC“, which are apparently
a set of third-party, non-Microsoft UI controls for WPF? Which comes
preinstalled with Windows sometimes? What is even happening over there?
The entire set of scripts makes use of Chocolatey wrapped in Boxstarter,
which is “a wrapper for Chocolatey and includes features like managing
reboots for you”, because of course, the people at Microsoft working on
Windows can’t be bothered to fix application management and required
reboots themselves. Silly me, expecting Microsoft’s Windows developers
to address these shortcomings internally instead of using third-party
tools. The repository seems to be mostly defunct, but the fact it even
exists in the first place is such a damning indictment of the state of
Windows. People keep telling us Windows is fine, but if even Microsoft
itself needs to resort to scripts and third-party tools to make it
usable, I find it hard to take claims of Windows being fine seriously in
any way, shape, or form.</p>

<h2 id="gsoc-2024-the-1001-thresholds-in-llvm">GSoC 2024: The 1001
thresholds in LLVM</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-21, from: LLVM Blog</p>
<p>
Hey everyone! My name is Shourya and I worked on LLVM this summer
through GSoC. My project is called
<a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/MnheN07A">The
1001 thresholds in LLVM</a>. The main objective of this project was to
study how varying different thresholds in llvm affect performance
parameters like compile-time, bitcode-size, execution-time and llvm
stats.
</p>
<h1 id="background">
Background
</h1>
<p>
LLVM has lots of thresholds and flags to avoid “costly cases”. However,
it is unclear if these thresholds are useful, their value is reasonable,
and what impact they really have. Since there are a lot, one cannot do a
simple exhaustive search. An example of work in this direction includes
the introduction of a C++ class that can replace hardcoded values which
offers control over the threshold, e.g., one can increase the recursion
limit via a command line flag from the hardcoded “6” to a different
number. As such there is a need to explore different thresholds in llvm,
understand what it means for a threshold to be hit, profile different
thresholds and select optimal values for different thresholds.
</p>
<h1 id="what-we-did">
What We Did
</h1>
<p>
This work provides a tool that can efficiently explore these knobs and
understand how modifying them affects metrics like compile time, size of
the generated program, or any statistic that LLVM emits like “Number of
loops vectorized”. (Note that execution-time is currently not evaluated
because input-gen does not work on optimized IR and is thus part of
future work.)
</p>
<p>
We first built a clang matcher for which we looked for the following
patterns :
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Const knob_name = knob_val
</li>
<li>
Cl::init
</li>
<li>
Enum {knob_name = knob_val}
</li>
</ol>
<p>
to first identify the
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J8G06FVoI6dyoz36_zCz1Z1udcLLg5If5gdSpcII-S8/edit?usp=sharing">knobs</a>
in the codebase and then used a custom python tool (optimised to deal
with I/O and cache bottlenecks) to collect the different stat values in
parallel and stored them in a json file. After manual selection of
interesting knobs, we have so far conducted three studies in which we
measure compile-time and bitcode-size along with various other
statistics, and present them in the form of interactive graphs. Two of
them (on 10,000 and 100 bitcode files) look at average statistics for
each knob value while the third one (on 10,000 bitcode files) studies
how each file is affected individually by changing knob values. We see
some very interesting patterns in these graphs, for instance in the
following two graphs, representing the jump-threading-threshold, we can
observe improved statistics (top graph) and decreased average compile
time (bottom graph) if the knob value is increased.

Results
</h1>
<p>
The per file study proves that there is no one single magic knob value
and the optimum, with regards to compile time or code size, depends on
the file that is currently being compiled. For instance here we can see
that different knob values (for the knob licm-mssa-optimization-cap)
give good cumulative compile time improvements for different files. In
detail, most files benefit from a knob value of 300 while 60 is the best
knob value for the second most files.

</div>
<p>
We further show that the presence of an oracle that can tell the best
knob value for each file can significantly improve the cumulative
compile time.

<p>
In this project, we explored various thresholds in LLVM—specifically, 93
thresholds (a 100 file study for each can be found
<a href="https://sh0g0-1758.github.io/GSOC-X-LLVM/100.html">here</a>)
using the Clang matcher—and observed that these thresholds are largely
file-specific. This indicates that there is no universally optimal
value, or even a set of values, that can be applied across different
scenarios. Instead, what is needed is an adaptive mechanism within LLVM,
an oracle, that can dynamically determine the appropriate threshold
values during compilation.
</p>
<p>
We also experimented with varying thresholds cumulatively by leveraging
file-specific information through an LLVM pass. However, after
discussions with the mentors, this approach was set aside due to the
significant changes it would necessitate across other parts of the LLVM
codebase.
</p>
<p>
As a result, we have not yet categorized different thresholds, such as
identifying optimal threshold values for specific file types (e.g.,
I/O-intensive files). Nonetheless, we provide a tool that can
efficiently collect this data (LLVM statistics, bitcode-size and
compile-time) and help visualize it with the help of interactive graphs
as well as histograms that examine these variations on a per-file basis.
Additionally, a correlation table between knob values and performance
metrics further illustrates the significant impact this study could have
on improving LLVM’s overall performance.
</p>
<h1 id="future-work">
Future Work
</h1>
<p>
The early results show that we need a better understanding of knob
values to maximise various objectives. Our results will provide the
community with the first step in developing a guided compilation model
attune to the file that is being compiled. We further intend to show how
these knobs interact with each other and whether modifying multiple
knobs together compounds the benefits or not. One more area of work
could be on
<a href="https://llvm.org/devmtg/2024-04/slides/LightningTalks/Ivanov-AutomaticProxyAppGeneration.pdf">input-gen</a>
that would enable us to collect and study execution-time in our
performance parameters.
