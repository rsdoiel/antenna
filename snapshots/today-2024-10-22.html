<h2 id="tmp-should-not-exist">/tmp should not exist</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>I commented on Lobsters that /tmp is usually a bad idea, which caused
some surprise. I suppose /tmp security bugs were common in the 1990s
when I was learning Unix, but they are pretty rare now so I can see why
less grizzled hackers might not be familiar with the problems. I guess
that’s some kind of success, but sadly the fixes have left behind a lot
of scar tissue because they didn’t address the underlying
problem: /tmp should not exist. ↫ Tony Finch Not only is this an
excellent, cohesive, and convincing argument against the existence of
/tmp, it also contains some nice historical context as to why things are
the way they are. Even without the arguments against /tmp, though, it
just seems entirely more logical, cleaner, and sensible to have /tmp
directories per user in per user locations. While I never would’ve been
able to so eloquently explain the problem as Finch does, it just feels
wrong to have every user resort to the exact same directory for
temporary files, like a complex confluence of bad decisions you just
know is going to cause problems, even if you don’t quite understand the
intricate interplay.</p>

id="apples-airpods-pro-hearing-health-features-are-as-good-as-they-sound">Apple’s
AirPods Pro hearing health features are as good as they sound</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>Apple announced a trio of major new hearing health features for the
AirPods Pro 2 in September, including clinical-grade hearing aid
functionality, a hearing test, and more robust hearing protection. All
three will roll out next week with the release of iOS 18.1, and
they could mark a watershed moment for hearing health awareness. Apple
is about to instantly turn the world’s most popular earbuds into an
over-the-counter hearing aid. ↫ Chris Welch at The Verge Rightfully so,
most of us here have a lot of issues with the major technology companies
and the way they do business, but every now and then, even they
accidentally stumble into doing something good for the world. AirPods
are already a success story, and gaining access to hearing aid-level
features at their price point is an absolute game changer for a lot of
people with hearing issues – and for a lot of people who don’t even yet
know they have hearing issues in the first place. If you have people in
your life with hearing issues, or whom you suspect may have hearing
issues, gifting them AirPods this Christmas season may just be a perfect
gift. Yes, I too think hearing aids should be a thing nobody has to pay
for and which should just be part of your country’s universal healthcare
coverage – assuming you have such a thing – but this is not a bad option
as a replacement.</p>

<h2 id="system76-unveils-arm-ampere-altra-workstation">System76 unveils
ARM Ampere Altra workstation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>System76, purveyor of Linux computers, distributions, and now also
desktop environments, has just unveiled its latest top-end workstation,
but this time, it’s not an x86 machine. They’ve been working together
with Ampere to build a workstation based around Ampere’s Altra ARM
processors: the Thelio Astra. Phoronix, fine purveyor of Linux-focused
benchmarks, were lucky enough to benchmark one, and has more information
on the new workstation. System76 designed the Thelio Astra in
collaboration with Ampere Computing. The System76 Thelio Astra makes use
of Ampere Altra processors up to the Ampere Altra Max 128-core ARMv8
processor that in turn supports 8-channel DDR4 ECC memory. The Thelio
Astra can be configured with up to 512GB of system memory, choice of
Ampere Altra processors, up to NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada Generation graphics,
dual 10 Gigabit Ethernet, and up to 16TB of PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD storage.
System76 designed the Thelio Astra ARM64 workstation to be complemented
by NVIDIA graphics given the pervasiveness of NVIDIA GPUs/accelerators
for artificial intelligence and machine learning workloads. The Astra is
contained within System76’s custom-designed, in-house-manufactured
Thelio chassis. Pricing on the System76 Thelio Astra will start out at
$3,299 USD with the 64-core Ampere Altra Q64-22 processor, 2 x 32GB of
ECC DDR4-3200 memory, 500GB NVMe SSD, and NVIDIA A402 graphics card. ↫
Michael Larabel This pricing is actually remarkably favourable
considering the hardware you’re getting. System76 and its employees have
been dropping hints for a while now they were working on an ARM variant
of their Thelio workstation, and knowing some of the prices others are
asking, I definitely expected the base price to hit $5000, so this is a
pleasant surprise. With the Altra processors getting a tiny bit long in
the tooth, you do notice some oddities here, specifically the DDR4 RAM
instead of the modern DDR5, as well as the lack of PCIe 5.0. The problem
is that while the Altra has a successor in the AmpereOne processor, its
availability is quite limited, and most of them probably end up in
datacentres and expensive servers for big tech companies. This newer
variant does come with DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 support, but doesn’t yet have a
lower core count version, so even if it were readily available it might
simply push the price too far up. Regardless, the Altra is still a
ridiculously powerful processor, and at anywhere between 64 and 128
cores, it’s got power to spare. The Thelio Astra will be available come
12 November, and while I would perform a considerable number of
eyebrow-raising acts to get my hands on one, it’s unlikely System76 will
ship one over for a review.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago everyone was arguing about “founder mode”, but before
it came the idea of “Peace time CEO/War time CEO”. The removal of the
unnecessary violence in the metaphor is an improvement, but the content
of peacetime/wartime is actually better. It’s more specific, and more
about operating with focus and efficiency. Founder mode […]</p>

id="microsoft-maintains-its-own-windows-debloat-scripts-on-github">Microsoft
maintains its own Windows debloat scripts on GitHub</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s no secret that a default Windows installation is… Hefty. In more
ways than one, Windows is a bit on the obese side of the spectrum, from
taking up a lot of disk space, to requiring hefty system requirements
(artificial or not), to coming with a lot of stuff preinstalled not
everyone wants to have to deal with. As such, there’s a huge cottage
industry of applications, scripts, modified installers, custom ISOs, and
more, that try to slim Windows down to a more manageable size. As it
turns out, even Microsoft itself wants in on this action. The company
that develops and sells Windows also provides a Windows debloat script.
Over on GitHub, Microsoft maintains a repository of scripts simplify
setting up Windows as a development environment, and amid the collection
of scripts we find RemoveDefaultApps.ps1, a PowerShell script to
“Uninstall unnecessary applications that come with Windows out of the
box”. The script is about two years old, and as such it includes a few
applications no longer part of Windows, but looking through the list is
a sad reminder of the kind of junk Windows comes with, most notably
mobile casino games for children like Bubble Witch and March of Empires,
but also other nonsense like the Mixed Reality Portal or Duolingo. It
also removes something called “ActiproSoftwareLLC“, which are apparently
a set of third-party, non-Microsoft UI controls for WPF? Which comes
preinstalled with Windows sometimes? What is even happening over there?
The entire set of scripts makes use of Chocolatey wrapped in Boxstarter,
which is “a wrapper for Chocolatey and includes features like managing
reboots for you”, because of course, the people at Microsoft working on
Windows can’t be bothered to fix application management and required
reboots themselves. Silly me, expecting Microsoft’s Windows developers
to address these shortcomings internally instead of using third-party
tools. The repository seems to be mostly defunct, but the fact it even
exists in the first place is such a damning indictment of the state of
Windows. People keep telling us Windows is fine, but if even Microsoft
itself needs to resort to scripts and third-party tools to make it
usable, I find it hard to take claims of Windows being fine seriously in
any way, shape, or form.</p>

thresholds in LLVM</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-21, from: LLVM Blog</p>
<p>
Hey everyone! My name is Shourya and I worked on LLVM this summer
through GSoC. My project is called
<a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/MnheN07A">The
1001 thresholds in LLVM</a>. The main objective of this project was to
study how varying different thresholds in llvm affect performance
parameters like compile-time, bitcode-size, execution-time and llvm
stats.
</p>
<h1 id="background">
Background
</h1>
<p>
LLVM has lots of thresholds and flags to avoid “costly cases”. However,
it is unclear if these thresholds are useful, their value is reasonable,
and what impact they really have. Since there are a lot, one cannot do a
simple exhaustive search. An example of work in this direction includes
the introduction of a C++ class that can replace hardcoded values which
offers control over the threshold, e.g., one can increase the recursion
limit via a command line flag from the hardcoded “6” to a different
number. As such there is a need to explore different thresholds in llvm,
understand what it means for a threshold to be hit, profile different
thresholds and select optimal values for different thresholds.
</p>
<h1 id="what-we-did">
What We Did
</h1>
<p>
This work provides a tool that can efficiently explore these knobs and
understand how modifying them affects metrics like compile time, size of
the generated program, or any statistic that LLVM emits like “Number of
loops vectorized”. (Note that execution-time is currently not evaluated
because input-gen does not work on optimized IR and is thus part of
future work.)
</p>
<p>
We first built a clang matcher for which we looked for the following
patterns :
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Const knob_name = knob_val
</li>
<li>
Cl::init
</li>
<li>
Enum {knob_name = knob_val}
</li>
</ol>
<p>
to first identify the
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J8G06FVoI6dyoz36_zCz1Z1udcLLg5If5gdSpcII-S8/edit?usp=sharing">knobs</a>
in the codebase and then used a custom python tool (optimised to deal
with I/O and cache bottlenecks) to collect the different stat values in
parallel and stored them in a json file. After manual selection of
interesting knobs, we have so far conducted three studies in which we
measure compile-time and bitcode-size along with various other
statistics, and present them in the form of interactive graphs. Two of
them (on 10,000 and 100 bitcode files) look at average statistics for
each knob value while the third one (on 10,000 bitcode files) studies
how each file is affected individually by changing knob values. We see
some very interesting patterns in these graphs, for instance in the
following two graphs, representing the jump-threading-threshold, we can
observe improved statistics (top graph) and decreased average compile
time (bottom graph) if the knob value is increased.

<p>
The per file study proves that there is no one single magic knob value
and the optimum, with regards to compile time or code size, depends on
the file that is currently being compiled. For instance here we can see
that different knob values (for the knob licm-mssa-optimization-cap)
give good cumulative compile time improvements for different files. In
detail, most files benefit from a knob value of 300 while 60 is the best
knob value for the second most files.

<p>
We further show that the presence of an oracle that can tell the best
knob value for each file can significantly improve the cumulative
compile time.

<p>
In this project, we explored various thresholds in LLVM—specifically, 93
thresholds (a 100 file study for each can be found
<a href="https://sh0g0-1758.github.io/GSOC-X-LLVM/100.html">here</a>)
using the Clang matcher—and observed that these thresholds are largely
file-specific. This indicates that there is no universally optimal
value, or even a set of values, that can be applied across different
scenarios. Instead, what is needed is an adaptive mechanism within LLVM,
an oracle, that can dynamically determine the appropriate threshold
values during compilation.
</p>
<p>
We also experimented with varying thresholds cumulatively by leveraging
file-specific information through an LLVM pass. However, after
discussions with the mentors, this approach was set aside due to the
significant changes it would necessitate across other parts of the LLVM
codebase.
</p>
<p>
As a result, we have not yet categorized different thresholds, such as
identifying optimal threshold values for specific file types (e.g.,
I/O-intensive files). Nonetheless, we provide a tool that can
efficiently collect this data (LLVM statistics, bitcode-size and
compile-time) and help visualize it with the help of interactive graphs
as well as histograms that examine these variations on a per-file basis.
Additionally, a correlation table between knob values and performance
metrics further illustrates the significant impact this study could have
on improving LLVM’s overall performance.

Future Work
</h1>
<p>
The early results show that we need a better understanding of knob
values to maximise various objectives. Our results will provide the
community with the first step in developing a guided compilation model
attune to the file that is being compiled. We further intend to show how
these knobs interact with each other and whether modifying multiple
knobs together compounds the benefits or not. One more area of work
could be on
<a href="https://llvm.org/devmtg/2024-04/slides/LightningTalks/Ivanov-AutomaticProxyAppGeneration.pdf">input-gen</a>
that would enable us to collect and study execution-time in our
performance parameters.
