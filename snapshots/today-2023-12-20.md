## Negotiations Over US Aid to Ukraine Expected to Stretch Past Christmas

date: 2023-12-20, from: VOA News USA

Capitol Hill — U.S. lawmakers will work into the Christmas holiday next week, seeking to negotiate a deal on border security in return for Republican votes to send more aid to Ukraine.


“Challenging issues remain, but we are committed to addressing needs at the southern border and to helping allies and partners confront serious threats in Israel, Ukraine and the Indo-Pacific. The Senate will not let these national security challenges go unanswered,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a joint statement late Tuesday.


“As negotiators work through remaining issues, it is our hope that their efforts will allow the Senate to take swift action on the national security supplemental early in the new year,” the statement continued.


Schumer told reporters earlier Tuesday that while he is optimistic about the progress of negotiations, lawmakers need more time.


“The details in this matter immensely, because this is not a topic that Congress has tackled in many years. We know that this is going to be not easy to do,” said the Senate’s top Democrat. “But we know too, that we must get it done. And while we've made important progress over the past week on border security, everyone agrees on both sides that it takes more time.”


Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell also acknowledged the difficulties, noting the last major piece of legislation on immigration and border security became law in the late 1980s.


“We haven't passed a significant immigration bill since Reagan’s second term. This is not easy. But we're working hard to get an outcome because the country needs it, and the country needs it soon,” McConnell told reporters Tuesday, referring to former president Ronald Reagan who served in the 1980s.


The United States has already dedicated more than $100 billion to arming and supporting Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, and President Joe Biden has asked Congress to approve another $60 billion. Republicans in Congress have become increasingly skeptical about the need to continue underwriting Ukraine's defense.


In recent weeks, Republicans in the Senate have conditioned approval of any additional money for Ukraine on the simultaneous strengthening of immigration rules aimed at reducing the number of people illegally entering the United States at its southern border and expelling some who are already in the country.




The White House has warned there is only enough for one more military aid package to Ukraine before funding runs out at year’s end.


“The United States has done the preponderance of military support,” Colin Cleary, an adjunct professor at the George Washington University and a veteran of the Foreign Service who served in Ukraine, told VOA.


“The crisis really would be on the military side if aid didn't happen. And in those two dimensions — the positional warfare that requires a lot of ammunition and supplies, and also the protection of the civilian infrastructure through air defense,” he said.




Even if an agreement passes in the Senate, it might not survive in the House, where Republicans hold a very narrow majority. A significant group of Republican House members opposes additional aid to Ukraine, and the party recently voted out a speaker who partnered with Democrats to pass legislation.




House Speaker Mike Johnson, who took over after predecessor Kevin McCarthy was ousted, has said that more funding for the border is essential to any Ukrainian aid package; however, he also wants more conditions placed on the aid.


"What the Biden administration seems to be asking for is billions of additional dollars with no appropriate oversight, no clear strategy to win, and none of the answers that I think the American people are owed," he said last week.


International reaction


Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin publicly celebrated the fact that Ukraine appears to be losing support in the West.


"Ukraine today produces nearly nothing; they are trying to preserve something, but they don't produce practically anything themselves and bring everything in for free," he said, according to The Associated Press. "But the freebies may end at some point and apparently it's coming to an end little by little."


While opponents of aid to Ukraine often denigrate aid packages as being a "blank check" handed over to the Ukrainian government, most of the aid is in the form of military hardware. The dollar figures in the aid packages mostly represent money spent in the U.S. to pay arms manufacturers for the equipment the U.S. ships to Ukraine.




Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Tuesday he was confident the U.S. would not "betray" his country by withholding crucial wartime funding as it fights off a Russian invasion.


"We are working very hard on this, and I am certain the United States of America will not betray us, and that on which we agreed in the United States will be fulfilled completely," Zelenskyy said during a televised news briefing in Kyiv.

## US Charges Alleged Hezbollah Member Over 1994 Argentina Bombing

date: 2023-12-20, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — A U.S. court on Wednesday unsealed an indictment charging an alleged senior Hezbollah operative with terrorism charges, in part for coordinating a 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires that killed 85 people. 


Federal prosecutors in Manhattan said Samuel Salman El Reda, 58, had coordinated Hezbollah's activities in South America, Asia and Lebanon since 1993. The Iran-backed, heavily armed Shiite group is part of Lebanon's coalition government.  


Prosecutors said El Reda is based in Lebanon and remains at large. The U.S. State Department in 2019 sanctioned El Reda and offered a $7 million reward for information on his whereabouts.  


Argentina also blames Hezbollah for a 1992 attack on the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires that killed 29 people.

## Chinese telecom giant Huawei pushes forward with ambitious plan to dethrone Android

date: 2023-12-20, from: OS News

Hundreds of technical experts from many of China’s biggest state-owned and private companies, including the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China Telecom, Meituan, and Baidu, all gathered in Beijing last month. The purpose behind the meeting was for their staff to receive training so they could be certified as developers on Huawei’s Harmony Operation System (OS). While most observers were looking the other way, Huawei has been quietly building an independent Chinese operating system that isn’t subject to U.S. sanctions. In the four years after the telecom giant was banned from using Google apps, the Shenzhen-based company has been making significant strides toward achieving its long-term goal: To dethrone Android and make its HarmonyOS the default operating system in China. ↫ Nina Xiang for Forbes Asia HarmonyOS is poised to succeed in beating iOS and Android where others have failed, if only because the Chinese state is pushing homegrown solutions hard. It&#8217;s already hit 10% market share in China, closing in on iOS&#8217; 17%, but still kilometres away from Android&#8217;s 72%. However, with both local governments and the government in Beijing enacting all kinds of laws and guidelines to force companies, institutions, and people to switch to homegrown solutions, it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me to see this market share climb fast. And that&#8217;s actually okay! Setting aside the fact the Chinese government is a genocidal totalitarian surveillance nightmare apparatus, I think it&#8217;s entirely understandable, reasonable, and a good investment to have homegrown technology solutions and platforms. I wish the European Union did something similar, but that ship has probably sailed after we let Microsoft gut whatever was left of Nokia after Apple was done with it.

## Japan Court Orders Okinawa to Approve Modified Plan to Build Runways for US Marine Corps

date: 2023-12-20, from: VOA News USA

TOKYO  — A Japanese court on Wednesday ordered the governor of Okinawa to approve the central government's modified plan for landfill work at the planned relocation site of a key U.S. military base on the southern island despite persistent opposition and protests by residents. 


The decision will move forward the suspended construction at a time Okinawa's strategic importance is becoming key for the Japan-U.S. military alliance in the face of growing tensions with China. Japan also rapidly seeks to build up its military in the southwestern region. 


The ruling by the Fukuoka High Court Naha branch allows the Land and Transport Ministry to order the modification work designed to reinforce extremely soft ground at the designated relocation site for U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, overriding Gov. Denny Tamaki's disapproval. The ruling ordered Tamaki to issue the approval within three working days. 


Tamaki said it was unjust that the will of the residents is crushed by the central government. 


Tamaki, noting the spirit of local government autonomy and democracy, said in a statement that the ruling that allows the government's forcible execution of its planned construction of a new military base is "absolutely unacceptable." 


If completed, the new site will serve a key Marine Corps facility for the region and also will be home to MV-22 Ospreys that are currently deployed at Futenma. 


Tamaki can still appeal to the Supreme Court, but the local government at this point has no power to stop the work unless the top court overturns the decision. 


Okinawa and the central government have long tussled over the relocation of the Futenma base. 


The Japanese and U.S. governments initially agreed in 1996 to close the Futenma air station a year after the rape of a schoolgirl by three U.S. military personnel led to a massive anti-base movement. But persistent protests and lawsuits between Okinawa and Tokyo have held up the plan for nearly 30 years. 


Japan's central government began the reclamation work off Henoko Bay on the eastern coast of Okinawa in 2018 to pave the way for the relocation of the Futenma base from its crowded neighborhood on the island. 


The central government later found out that large areas of the designated reclamation site are on soft ground, which some experts described "as soft as mayonnaise," and submitted a revision to the original plan with additional land improvement. But Okinawa's prefectural government rejected the revision plan and suspended the reclamation work. 


The ground improvement plan requires tens of thousands of pillars and massive amounts of soil, which opponents say would damage the environment. It is expected to cost 930 billion yen ($6.5 billion), 2.5 times the initial estimate, and take 12 years to finish, according to the Defense Ministry. 


The Supreme Court in September turned down Okinawa's appeal in another lawsuit that ordered the prefecture to withdraw its rejection of the modified landfill plan. 


Tamaki has called for a significant reduction of the U.S. military on the island, which is home to more than half of 50,000 American troops based in Japan under the bilateral security pact. Tamaki also has demanded the immediate closure of Futenma base and the scrapping of the base construction at Henoko. Okinawa accounts for just 0.6% of Japanese land. 


Tokyo and Washington say the relocation within Okinawa, instead of moving it elsewhere as demanded by many Okinawans, is the only solution. 


"We believe that action should be taken promptly in line with this ruling," Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said. He pledged that the government will continue to make effort for the return of the Futenma air station as soon as possible to reduce the burden from the base.

## Around $1 billion in IRS penalties waived

date: 2023-12-20, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>With the new year, the IRS will resume sending reminder letters to taxpayers with old debts to the federal government, which were paused during the pandemic. But to avoid causing sticker shock when people receive reminders, the IRS is waiving the penalties it usually charges for back taxes. We dig in. And later, a boost in U.S. oil production spoils OPEC&#8217;s effort to prop up prices.</p>

## They're letting us have RSS

date: 2023-12-20, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Assume that FB doesn't really want to interop, so that's why there's a year timeline on developing AP functionality. No rush. Let's keep growing and later on we can have an app store that only lets certain sites into our world, subject to our turning them off at any time. </p>
<p>Assuming this is true, RSS is their worst nightmare. It's implemented in a week, if you're really careful and there are good toolkits for every platform, and lots of developers know what to do with it, and even worse, there already is a huge installed base of such apps and they all have vociferous users who would be thrilled to be heard, because they largely feel like they're pissing in the wind. </p>
<p>Remember they said RSS is Dead. I always felt that was aimed at me, but it was aimed at them too, even more so.</p>
<p>The thing to do, build -- intelligently, slowly, showing interop at every step. Watch out for people who take stuff out with out putting back. </p>

If journalism wants to help inform the populace of the stakes, I'd like them to stop using the term neo-Nazi. There's nothing new about being a Nazi. It adds a tiny bit of confusion at exactly the point where you want zero confusion. It took journalism a long time to use the term insurrection about the January 6 events, that hurt us too. Understand where the path we're on leads, and don't give people a reason to hope that it's not as serious as it is.

## How the candy cane gets made

<p>What can a beloved, sugary holiday treat teach us about trade protectionism, overseas farm subsidies, inflation and inelastic demand? Turns out, quite a bit. Today, we trace how sugarcane from Louisiana becomes a hand-spun, red-and-white-striped delight at a New Jersey candy shop — and learn a thing or two about economics along the way. But first: The Senate leaves for a holiday recess without any approved aid for Ukraine or Israel.</p>

Biden moves to protect ‘old growth’ forests</h3><p style=""><strong></strong>President Biden issued a <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=ce7ee686d9&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proposal</a> yesterday to protect some of the oldest trees in America’s national forests from commercial logging. The move has climate ramifications because older trees are natural carbon sinks, so keeping them alive prevents that carbon from being released into the atmosphere and contributing to global warming. “Older forests provide the most above-ground carbon storage potential on Earth, with mature forests and larger trees driving most accumulation of forest carbon in the critical next few decades,” a group of scientists wrote in a <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=82e0cac143&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">letter</a> to Biden last year. “Left vulnerable to logging, though, they cannot fulfill these vital functions.” The proposal doesn’t protect “mature” trees, which aren’t quite as ancient as “old growth” trees. This concession is “a middle ground between environmentalists and the timber industry,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=80e50a04bb&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">says</a> Lauren Aratani at <em>The Guardian</em>. The ban is set to come into place in 2025 and comes as part of an executive order, so whether it goes ahead could depend on the outcome of the 2024 election.</p><h3 style="">3. California will start turning wastewater into drinking water</h3><p style=""><strong></strong>California officials yesterday approved regulations allowing wastewater from toilets and showers to be recycled into drinking water for hundreds of thousands of people. “As we look to make our communities more resilient to drought, to climate change, this is really going to be an important part of that solution,” Heather Cooley, director of research at water think tank Pacific Institute, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=0b72864112&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tells</a> the<em> Los Angeles Times</em>. Colorado has similar rules in place already, and Arizona and Florida could soon follow suit. The wastewater recycling process has undergone extensive review by scientists and engineers who insist it is clean and safe. The water is filtered, decontaminated, disinfected, and monitored, making it “purer than many drinking water sources we now rely on,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=62607efa33&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">says</a> E.

The deal will last for 10 years and the money is expected to help pay for museum upgrades and refurbishments. The sponsorship isn’t new: BP has partnered with the museum since 1996. But it comes at a time when cultural institutions in Britain and elsewhere are under pressure from climate activists to cut ties with fossil fuel companies. One activist group has threatened legal action in response to the move, and Greenpeace <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=350c1ea918&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called it</a> “brazen greenwashing.” But, as the <em>Times</em> of London <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e6f0fe5bb0&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">points out</a>, most of Britain’s museums charge nothing for entrance and rely heavily on philanthropy and sponsorship. “Money needs to come from somewhere,” the paper says.</p><h3 style="">5.

## Airbnb fined for its dollar dilemma down under

date: 2023-12-20, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Airbnb has been ordered to pay up to $20 million in fines and compensation after misleading customers in Australia. Some bookings there were listed in U.S. dollars rather than Australian dollars, making them look cheaper than they actually were. Plus, we look at the delisting of Toshiba in Japan. And later: Inflation can even affect candy canes.</p>

## US baby boomers over 70 hold more than 30% of country’s wealth

date: 2023-12-20, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>Most don&#8217;t work anymore, but Americans age 70 and older have seen their share of collective wealth surge during the pandemic. As a group, these older baby boomers have accumulated more than $14 trillion in additional net worth since the end 2019, based on Federal Reserve data. Their share of the country&#8217;s wealth has jumped to a record 30% last quarter, even though they account for 11% of the population. The aging population helps explain some the gains: There are about 2.3 million more people over 70 in the country than in 2019. But one major driver was the surge in home values and stocks during the pandemic, which benefited older generations most likely to own a house &#8212; or two &#8212; and hold equities or mutual funds.</p>

## Zelenskyy says Ukraine not at risk of losing war with Russia

				<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his military isn&#8217;t at risk of losing the war with Russia and expressed confidence the U.S. will deliver on its $61 billion in aid held up by a political standoff. &#8220;I&#8217;m certain the U.S. won&#8217;t betray us &#8212; and what has been agreed upon will be fulfilled,&#8221; Zelenskyy told reporters in Kyiv at a wide-ranging press conference organized to close out the year.

## Hex time

date: 2023-12-20, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>Hex time</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>My wife left to spend the day in a spa with a friend of hers and I
  am listening to Louis Armstrong recordings from the 1930s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I read a discussion between <a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@munroe" title="@munroe@dice.camp">@munroe</a> and <a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@Da_Gut" title="@Da_Gut@dice.camp">@Da_Gut</a>
about hex sizes for a hexcrawl. My personal take is to think of hexes
as distances one can travel in a certain time.</p>

<p>Think about the diversity of the landscape one can see in a day of
travel. Arable lands and a forest. Two regions? Arable lands, a
forest, hills, a plateau. Four? That is the number of hexes per day.
And nobody cares about the miles.</p>

<p>In my case, I think that &ldquo;one hex is one day of walking&rdquo; makes the most
sense. In the morning, you&rsquo;re leaving one hex and in the afternoon
you&rsquo;re arriving in the next hex. This assumes an uncharted wilderness.
When I try to leave the forest trails in the hills around Zürich or in
the Swiss mountains, I feel that progress is really slow. Super slow.
Extremely slow. Sure, I can walk as far as the horizon in some cases,
but that&rsquo;s on gravel roads prepared by industrial machines and
maintained by a state that is fed by all the tax evading billionaires
and conglomerates of the whole planet. So out there in Fantasy land,
it&rsquo;s more like me trying to find a shortcut in the Swiss mountains and
forests.</p>

<p>And sure, if people have horses and mules to carry their stuff, they
can travel faster. Twice as fast makes it easy to move the little
token around on the map. And roads also speed things up. Like, twice
as fast? With horses and mules to carry stuff, on a flat road: 4 hexes
per day. If you want to read up on ancient rows, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_roads_and_trails">historic roads
and trails</a>
on Wikipedia.</p>

<p>Regular exploration of the wilderness where the players are strangers,
intruders, colonizers, potential murderers, belonging to the
wannabe-conquerors, then surely it&rsquo;s going to be 1 hex per day. This
is the equivalent of slow and careful dungeon exploration speed. Avoid
getting lost in the bogs, crossing the rivers and creeks without
losing your stuff, without getting ambushed in gullies and canyons,
without getting lost in forests, without slipping into ravines,
spraining angles or scraping your knees, keeping dry, finding good
camping sites, digging a latrine, digging a fire pit, washing clothes,
maintaining equipment, baking bread, and on and on. This is the speed
you can maintain for long expeditions.</p>

<p>Now, you can get into all the nitty-gritty of it all. Luckily,
<a class="account" href="https://rollenspiel.social/@settembrini" title="@settembrini@rollenspiel.social">@settembrini</a> already did all that and wrote <a href="https://hofrat.rsp-blogs.de/2023/12/01/inch-by-inch-its-all-a-cinch-by-the-yard-its-hard/">Inch
by inch it’s all a cinch, by the yard it’s
hard</a>.
It&rsquo;s a long article and not an easy read. But here&rsquo;s one of the things
I can put into my gamer notes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1 hour’s walk = 1 league = 3 miles = 3000 double paces = 15 000
feet= 5000 yards.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So let&rsquo;s go back to my example. Using the above equivalences, 8 hours
of walking takes you 24 miles out in the open, on a road or well kept
and straight trail. At the same time, I said that 1 day of walking is
2 hexes in my world, without mules or horses. So now we know: one day
of walking is 24 miles and 2 hexes. Therefore my hexes should be 12 miles
across, if you really need to know.</p>

<p>But of course you don&rsquo;t because nothing happens &ldquo;per mile&rdquo; in the
game. All the things happen &ldquo;per unit of time&rdquo;. The most important one
of these is &ldquo;how many random encounters per day?&rdquo; Or &ldquo;per 4 hour
watch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m serious about one thing, however: It&rsquo;s better if you don&rsquo;t think
about the miles per hex. If you do, you&rsquo;ll keep thinking about all the
other things, too. How far was your hike last summer? Did you have to
set up camp? How heavy was your backpack? Did you wear armour? Is
travelling by horse really faster than walking by foot if you can&rsquo;t
switch horses? How fast are you if you have two horses per person? How
fast is a wagon. The questions are endless and somehow I find them all
very boring questions. These are not <a href="2023-01-20_The_power_of_questions.md">good
questions</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s better if you think about what&rsquo;s important in the game for you
and the table and go from there. Is the world dangerous because of
random encounters? Start with the question of how often you want to
roll for random encounters as the party travels from landmark to
landmark. Think about the distances between settlements.
Traditionally, that would be about a day&rsquo;s march by foot in arable
land: half a day out and do a bit of work and half a day back is the
limit.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s say you answered the above with &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to roll once for
random encounters per day of travel&rdquo;. And every landmark has
something: either it&rsquo;s arable land so there are people living there, a
camp, a hamlet, a village, or it&rsquo;s dangerous because of a monster
lair, or because of a natural hazard like mountains, swamps, deep
forest, or something else that&rsquo;s similarly inhospitable.</p>

<p>If you follow this train of thought then you&rsquo;ll arrive at my setup:
the slowest speed is one hex per day, and then there are ways to speed
things up with transporation methods and infrastructure. Take a boat
downriver or along the coast: 8 hexes per day? More? What about taking
a boat upriver? Just as slow as walking but you can unlimited
supplies? How far can the flying carpet go? All these questions need
settling, eventually. All I am concerned about right now, however, is
that they can be answered in principle: a certain multiple of the
slowest speed is good enough.</p>

<p>The only good argument for switching things up that I can think of is
wanting to present more variety to your players. No problem. If the
land is full of stuff, a river ford, a tower ruin, then up onto the
plateau and into the moors until you reach the cairns of Arguable, you
can scale it up. Multiply it all by two or three or four and you&rsquo;re
good to go. I find that this leads to a lot more mapping and so I
don&rsquo;t do it, but if you feel like it, you have my blessings.</p>

<p>If you are like me and prefer more diversity in theory but cannot be
bothered to map in practice, I have a suggestion: start with the
sparse map and keep adding. Using the example above, there&rsquo;s a hex
with a settlement, and the next hex is hills, and there&rsquo;s a river
between the two. You can improvise a story about the fields giving way
to brushland, the river winding its way between the willows and the
ford with the poles of King Borgobob who raised them in the times of
your grandfather, and then there&rsquo;s that plateau. If the players don&rsquo;t
look for the tower, it does not show up. But if the players know about
the old tower you add a tower symbol to the hill hex and presto, one
more landmark in the same hex. They know about the cairn, too? Then
it&rsquo;s a tower and a cairn. You can even number the sides of a hex: 1 is
north, 2 is south-east, 3 is south-west, and so on. Then your notes
can say &ldquo;1: cairn, 4: old tower&rdquo; and depending on how the party
crosses the hexes, you&rsquo;ll know whether they pass by the thing or
wether they can spot it from a distance or whether they&rsquo;ll have to
search for it.</p>

<p>I also like to label geographic features. Label settlements, forests,
mountains, swamps, rivers, trails. I feel that adds so much.</p>

<p>Down below is a snapshot of the player map in my German Greyhawk
campaign where I run the Elredd region on the Wild Coast. How long
does it take to travel from Elredd to Moorwies along the
Miesbohlenweg? 1 hex/day in the wilderness, 2 hexes/day on the road:
From Elredd to Brackmühl is a day, from Brackmühl to Kreuzdorf is a
day, and from Kreuzdorf to Moorwies is half a day, or perhaps the
swamp slows things down and the road is shit so it&rsquo;s a full day. So
three days total. If you had horses, then it&rsquo;s one day from Elredd to
Kreuzdorf, and then the shit trackway into the swamp… a second day? Or
maybe you can travel right through Moorwies and out of the swamp on
the other side. But my players don&rsquo;t know what lies to the west…</p>

<p>OK, but now I have a different problem. <a class="account" href="https://rollenspiel.ch/users/settembrini" title="@settembrini@rollenspiel.ch">@settembrini</a>
says that each hex is 10 km across. Now what? Let&rsquo;s take those
equivalences again and add a rough conversion to kilometers. 3 miles ×
1½ km/mi = 4½ km or 5000 years × 9/10 m/yard = 4500 m = 4½ km. Let&rsquo;s
round that to 5 km – or in keeping with this blog post: a 10 km hex
takes 2 h to walk through and in 8 h you can walk through 4 hexes, if
you&rsquo;re on a road, 2 hexes cross-country, 8 hexes if you ride on a good
road. Speed is sort-of doubled because 12 mi × 1½ km/mi = 18 km which
is nearly twice as much as 10 km.</p>

<p>So bow how long does it take to travel from Elredd to Moorwies along
the Miesbohlen way? 1 day from Elredd to Kreuzdorf. Plus 2 h on the
next day.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1 hour’s walk = 1 league = 3 miles = 3000 double paces = 15 000
feet= 5000 yards = 5 km</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My point with all of this: keep in mind how the map relates to events
in your <a href="-20_Hexcrawl_Procedure2012-06-20_Hexcrawl_Procedure">hexcrawl
procedure</a>. With
the &ldquo;new&rdquo; ruling handed down to me regarding my map, I keep the idea
that there is a single encounter check to be made during the day (and
one to be made during the night if the party is camping out in the
open).</p>

## Trump Defends Comments About Immigrants ‘Poisoning the Blood’ of America

date: 2023-12-20, from: VOA News USA

WATERLOO, Iowa — Former U.S.  President Donald Trump on Tuesday defended his comments about migrants crossing the southern border "poisoning the blood" of America, and he reinforced the message while denying any similarities to fascist writings others had noted.


"I never read 'Mein Kampf,'" Trump said at a campaign rally in Waterloo, Iowa, referencing Adolf Hitler's fascist manifesto.


Immigrants in the U.S. illegally, Trump said Tuesday, are "destroying the blood of our country, they're destroying the fabric of our country."


In the speech to more than 1,000 supporters from a podium flanked by Christmas trees in red MAGA hats, Trump responded to mounting criticism about his anti-immigrant "blood" purity rhetoric over the weekend.


Several politicians and extremism experts have noted his language echoed writings from Hitler about the "purity" of Aryan blood, which underpinned Nazi Germany's systematic murder of millions of Jews and other "undesirables" before and during World War II.


As illegal border crossings surge, topping 10,000 some days in December, Trump continued to blast Biden for allowing migrants to "pour into our country." He alleged, without offering evidence, that they bring crime and potential disease with them.


"They come from Africa, they come from Asia, they come from South America," he said, lamenting what he said was a "border catastrophe."


Trump made no mention of the Colorado Supreme Court's decision Tuesday to disqualify him from the state's ballot under the U.S. Constitution's insurrection clause, though his campaign blasted out a fundraising email about it during his speech.


The former president has long used inflammatory language about immigrants coming to the United States, dating back to his campaign launch in 2015, when he said immigrants from Mexico are "bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists."


But Trump has espoused increasingly authoritarian messages in his third campaign, vowing to renew and add to his effort to bar citizens from certain Muslim-majority countries, and to expand " ideological screening " for people immigrating to the U.S. He said he would be a dictator on "day one" only, in order to close the border and increase drilling.


In Waterloo on Tuesday, Trump's supporters in the crowd said his border policies were effective and necessary, even if he doesn't always say the right thing.


"I don't know if he says the right words all of the time," said 63-year-old Marylee Geist, adding that just because "you're not fortunate enough to be born in this country," doesn't mean "you don't get to come here."


"But it should all be done legally," she added.


It's about the volume of border crossings and national security, said her husband, John Geist, 68.


"America is the land of opportunity, however, the influx — it needs to be kept to a certain level," he said. "The amount of undocumented immigrants that come through and you don't know what you're getting, things aren't regulated properly."


Alex Litterer and her dad, Tom, of Charles City said they were concerned about migrants crossing the southern border, especially because the U.S. doesn't have the resources to support that influx. But the 22-year-old said she didn't agree with Trump's comments, adding that immigrants who come to the country legally contribute to the country's character and bring different perspectives.


Polling shows most Americans agree, with two-thirds saying the country's diverse population makes the U.S. stronger.


But Trump's "blood" purity message might resonate with some voters.


About a third of Americans overall worry that more immigration is causing U.S.-born Americans to lose their economic, political and cultural influence, according to a late 2021 poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.


Jackie Malecek, 50, of Waterloo said she likes Trump for the reasons that many people don't — how outspoken he is and "that he's a little bit of a loose cannon." But she thought Trump saying immigrants are "poisoning the blood" took it a little too far.


"I'm very much for cutting off what's happening at the border now. There's too many people pouring in here right now, I watch it every single day," Malecek said. "But that wording is not what I would have chosen to say."


Malecek said she supports allowing legal immigration and accepting refugees, but she is concerned about the waves of migrants crossing the border who are not being vetted.


Sen. JD Vance, a Republican from Ohio, lashed out at a reporter asking about Trump's "poisoning the blood" comments, defending them as a reference to overdoses from fentanyl smuggled over the border.


"You just framed your question implicitly assuming that Donald Trump is talking about Adolf Hitler. It's absurd," Vance said. "It is obvious that he was talking about the very clear fact that the blood of Americans is being poisoned by a drug epidemic."


At a congressional hearing July 12, James Mandryck, a Customs and Border Protection deputy assistant commissioner, said 73% of fentanyl seizures at the border since the previous October were smuggling attempts carried out by U.S. citizens, with the rest being done by Mexican citizens.


Extremism experts say Trump's rhetoric resembles the language that white supremacist shooters have used to justify mass killings.


Jon Lewis, a research fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism, pointed to the 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue shooter and this year's Texas mall shooter, who he said used similar language in writings before their attacks.


"Call it what it is," said Lewis. "This is fascism. This is white supremacy. This is dehumanizing language that would not be out of place in a white supremacist Signal or Telegram chat."


Asked about Trump's "poisoning the blood" comments, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell replied with a quip about his own wife, an immigrant, who was an appointee in Trump's administration.


"Well, it strikes me that didn't bother him when he appointed Elaine Chao secretary of transportation," McConnell said.


Trump currently leads other candidates, by far, in polls of likely Republican voters in Iowa and nationwide. Trump's campaign is hoping for a knockout performance in the caucuses that will deny his rivals momentum and allow him to quickly lock up the nomination. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has staked his campaign on Iowa, raising expectations for him there.

## lynx --nocolor

date: 2023-12-20, from: Jirka's blog

I really dislike how the Lynx WWW browser looks on some modern systems. On my  SGI it  was OK -  it simply respected  IRIS terminal  colors. On modern systems in seems to be full of colors with gray background. Text colors are quite  nice but I have disliked the  gray background. I have wished to have or black one  or transparent one (it a terminal emulator supports transparency).

## Workflow: Changes and additions

date: 2023-12-20, from: Jirka's blog

Things are continuously  developing or at least  changing. For example, my  gVim on  my GPD  Pocket (Ubuntu  MATE 18.04)  has issues  with text encoding.  If  I  create a  new  file  then  I  everything is  OK.  But when  I  save  it  and  re-open it  then  it  en-codes  local  language characters incorrectly.  It is  strange because I  have been  using the same  .vimrc/.gvimrc for  ages on  several Linux  machines and  I never encountered such behaviour.

## TRGpro tuning (2)

## TRGpro tuning

date: 2023-12-20, from: Jirka's blog

The PILOT  Pentopia Chameleon stylus  for Palm  III and VI   {sup}1{/sup} arrived today. It  is a  stylus with integrated  reset pin and  - last  but not least  - an  actual pen.  The pen  refill is  thin and  it is  labelled "Pilot" but I assume that  a thin (non-pressurized) Fischer refill will fit here. This stylus has a  bit different shape than the original Palm III pen and its tip is a bit harder but it is usable (I am writing this post with  it). It is  also little thicker  than the original  which is actually a plus - it sits more reliable in stylus housing of my heavily used Palms - I lost several styli from my old IIIxe and almost lost one of my TRGpro recently. The  {sup}1{/sup} says  that it is better for writing than the original stylus but I don't think so. I see no improvement.

## TRG Pro: first impressions

date: 2023-12-20, from: Jirka's blog

The title is  all wrong because I  extensively used the TRG  Pro in the past. But the last time when I synced  the TRG was in 2/2016 and then I have been using the original Palm III devices (IIIx + IIIxe) instead of the TRG. I have not wanted to damage  or lost my only TRG Pro (which is pretty rare as you  may know). Now I have two TRGs so  I can use one of them on daily basis, I think.

## Blue Origin Returns to Space After Year-long Hiatus

date: 2023-12-20, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Blue Origin launched its first rocket in more than a year on Tuesday, reviving the U.S. company's fortunes with a successful return to space following an uncrewed crash in 2022.


Though mission NS-24 carried a payload of science experiments, not people, it paves the way for Jeff Bezos' aerospace enterprise to resume taking wealthy thrill-seekers to the final frontier.


The New Shepard suborbital rocket blasted off from the pad at Launch Site One, near Van Horn, Texas, at 10:42 a.m.


After separating from the booster, the gumdrop-shaped capsule attained a peak altitude of 107 kilometers above sea level, well above the internationally recognized boundary of space known as the Karman line, which is 100 kilometers high.


The booster then successfully landed vertically on the launchpad, against the majestic backdrop of the Sierra Diablo mountains, followed a few minutes later by the capsule floating to the desert floor on three giant parachutes.


All in all, the mission lasted 10 minutes and 13 seconds.


"Demand for New Shepard flights continues to grow, and we're looking forward to increasing our flight cadence in 2024," said Phil Joyce, the company's senior vice president.


The science experiments onboard included one to demonstrate the operation of hydrogen fuel cell technology in microgravity, and another showing how water and gas move in a weightless environment.


Future applications could include monitoring water quality for astronauts in space.

On Sept. 12, 2022, a Blue Origin rocket became engulfed in flames shortly after launch. The capsule, fixed to the top of the rocket, successfully initiated an emergency separation sequence and floated safely to the ground on parachutes.


The accident prompted a year-long probe by the Federal Aviation Administration, which found it was caused by the failure of an engine nozzle that experienced higher-than-expected operating temperatures.


The regulator issued a set of corrective actions for Blue Origin to undertake before it could resume flying, including the redesign of certain engine parts. It confirmed Sunday that it had approved Blue Origin's application to fly again.


In all, Blue Origin has carried out six crewed flights — some passengers were paying customers and others were guests — since July 2021, when Bezos himself took part in the first.


While Blue Origin has been grounded, rival Virgin Galactic — the company founded by British billionaire Richard Branson — has pressed on, with five commercial flights this year.


The two companies compete in the emerging space tourism sector, operating in suborbital space.


While Blue Origin launches a small rocket vertically, Virgin Galactic uses a large carrier plane to gain altitude and then drop off a smaller, rocket-powered spaceplane that completes the journey to space.


In both cases, passengers enjoy a few minutes of weightlessness and can view the curvature of the Earth through large windows.


Virgin Galactic tickets were sold for between $200,000 to $450,000; Blue Origin does not publicly disclose its ticket prices.


Blue Origin can boast the fact that nearly all of its rocket platform is reused, including the booster, capsule, engine, landing gear and parachutes.


Its engine, meanwhile, is fueled by liquid oxygen and hydrogen, meaning the only byproduct during flight is water vapor, with no carbon emissions.


Blue Origin is also developing a heavy rocket for commercial purposes called New Glenn, with the maiden flight planned for next year.


This rocket, which measures 98 meters high, is designed to carry payloads of as much as 45 metric tons into low Earth orbit.

Not impotent tools, like congressional hearings or impeachment, but the actual guardrail meant to serve as a <a href="https://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment14/annotation15.html">last resort</a> to keep a nightmare out of the government.  An insurrectionist should be dealt with a lot more swiftly than Trump has and the penalty should be harsh to warn off other would-be coup plotters. But -- better late than never. </p>
<p>And if they want to have a civil war, okay -- better to do it when the military is under constitutional control, at least theoretically. Tell the Republicans to try again, now before any primary votes have been cast. This candidate is prohibited from being president, as if he were born outside the United States. Not qualified. </p>

## Drought-Prone California OKs New Rules for Turning Wastewater Directly Into Drinking Water

date: 2023-12-20, from: VOA News USA

SACRAMENTO, California  — When a toilet is flushed in California, the water can end up in a lot of places: an ice skating rink in Ontario, ski slopes around Lake Tahoe, farmland in the Central Valley.


And — coming soon — kitchen faucets.


California regulators on Tuesday approved new rules to let water agencies recycle wastewater and put it right back into the pipes that carry drinking water to homes, schools and businesses.


It's a big step for a state that has struggled for decades to secure reliable sources of drinking water for its more than 39 million residents. And it signals a shift in public opinion on a subject that as recently as two decades ago prompted backlash that scuttled similar projects.


Since then, California has been through multiple extreme droughts, including the most recent one that scientists say was the driest three-year period on record and left the state's reservoirs at dangerously low levels.




"Water is so precious in California. It is important that we use it more than once," said Jennifer West, managing director of WateReuse California, a group advocating for recycled water.


California has been using recycled wastewater for decades. The Ontario Reign minor league hockey team has used it to make ice for its rink in Southern California. Soda Springs Ski Resort near Lake Tahoe has used it to make snow. And farmers in the Central Valley, where much of the nation's vegetables, fruits and nuts are grown, use it to water their crops.


But it hasn't been used directly for drinking water. Orange County operates a large water purification system that recycles wastewater and then uses it to refill underground aquifers. The water mingles with the groundwater for months before being pumped up and used for drinking water again.


California's new rules would let — but not require — water agencies take wastewater, treat it and then put it right back into the drinking water system. California would be just the second state to allow this, following Colorado.


It's taken regulators more than 10 years to develop these rules, a process that included multiple reviews by independent panels of scientists. A state law required the California Water Resources Control Board to approve these regulations by December 31 — a deadline met with just days to spare.


The vote was heralded by some of the state's biggest water agencies, which all have plans to build huge water recycling plants in the coming years. The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which serves 19 million people, aims to produce up to 570 million liters (150 million gallons) per day of both direct and indirect recycled water. A project in San Diego is aiming to account for nearly half of the city's water by 2035.


Water agencies will need public support to complete these projects — which means convincing customers that not only is recycled water safe to drink, but it's not icky.




California's new rules require the wastewater to be treated for all pathogens and viruses, even if the pathogens and viruses aren't in the wastewater. That's different from regular water treatment rules, which require treatment only for known pathogens, said Darrin Polhemus, deputy director of the division of drinking water for the California Water Resources Control Board.


In fact, the treatment is so stringent it removes all of the minerals that make fresh drinking water taste good — meaning they have to be added back at the end of the process.


"It's at the same drinking water quality, and probably better in many instances," Polhemus said.


It's expensive and time-consuming to build these treatment facilities, so Polhemus said it will only be an option for bigger, well-funded cities — at least initially.




In San Jose, local officials have opened the Silicon Valley Advanced Water Purification Center for public tours "so that people can see that this is a very high-tech process that ensures the water is super clean," said Kirsten Struve, assistant officer for the water supply division at the Santa Clara Valley Water District.


Right now, the agency uses the water for things like irrigating parks and playing fields. But they plan to use it for drinking water in the future.


"We live in California where the drought happens all the time. And with climate change, it will only get worse," Struve said. "And this is a drought-resistant supply that we will need in the future to meet the demands of our communities."


Joaquin Esquivel, chair of the Water Resources Control Board that approved the new rules on Tuesday, noted that most people are already drinking recycled water anyway. Most wastewater treatment plants put their treated water back into rivers and streams, which then flow down to the next town so they can drink it.


"Anyone out there taking drinking water downstream from a wastewater treatment plant discharge — which, I promise you, you're all doing — is already drinking toilet to tap," Esquivel said. "All water is recycled. What we have here are standards, science and — importantly — monitoring that allow us to have the faith that it is pure water."

## WARC'in the crawler

date: 2023-12-20, from: Marginallia log

The Marginalia Crawler has seen improvements! A long term problem with the crawler design is that if for whatever reason the crawler shuts down, then it needs to re-start fetching whatever domains it was currently traversing during the termination from zero.
This isn&rsquo;t fantastic, since not only does crawling a website take a fair bit of time, it&rsquo;s a nuisance for the server admins to re-crawl stuff that was already fetched, and a real liability for ending up in robots.

## Biden Hails Justice O'Connor's Imprint on US, American Lives

date: 2023-12-19, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden hailed Sandra Day O'Connor as an "American pioneer" who embodied principle over politics in his eulogy at the Washington funeral of the U.S. Supreme Court's first female justice.  


Biden praised O'Connor for breaking down barriers in the legal and political worlds, transcending political divisions and weighing ordinary people in her decision-making in pointed remarks that contrasted sharply with his words about the current Supreme Court. 


"She was especially conscious of the law's real impact on people's lives," he said. "One need not agree with all her decisions in order to recognize that her principles were deeply held, and of the highest order, and that her desire for civility was genuine." 


O'Connor knew that "no person is an island" and that Americans — "rugged individualists, adventurers and entrepreneurs" — were inextricably linked, he said at the service in Washington National Cathedral. 


"And for America to thrive, Americans must see themselves not as enemies, but as partners in the great work of deciding our collective destiny," Biden said. 




Tributes to O'Connor, who died on December 1 at age 93, were also delivered by Chief Justice John Roberts and O'Connor's son Jay O'Connor.  


Sandra Day O'Connor died in Phoenix, Arizona, of complications related to advanced dementia and a respiratory illness. 


A centrist on the court who was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan in 1981, O'Connor served until her retirement in 2006.  


She created a critical alliance in 1992 to affirm the central holding in Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that made abortion legal nationwide. She also was a crucial vote in 2003 to uphold campus affirmative action policies that were used to increase the number of underrepresented minority students at American colleges. 


The Supreme Court, which now has a 6-3 conservative majority, overturned the Roe ruling in 2022, and in June struck down race-conscious admissions programs in higher education, effectively prohibiting affirmative action.  


Biden has said the current Supreme Court has done more to "unravel basic rights and basic decisions than any court in recent history," but has rejected calls to expand it. 




O'Connor's body lay in repose on Monday in the great hall of the Supreme Court in Washington, where all nine current justices attended a private ceremony before the public was invited to pay their respects. 


All the justices also were present for the funeral service.  


Chief Justice Roberts called her a "strong, influential and iconic jurist."  


It was hard for young people to imagine a time when women were not on the bench, he added, because O'Connor was so good. "She was so successful that the barriers she broke down are almost unthinkable today," he said. 


Jay O'Connor spoke of his mother as an indefatigable woman with "unearthly energy" who kept working long after she hung up her judicial robes. 


"What do we say to the special person? This little cowgirl? This remarkable woman from a remote cattle ranch in Arizona? This mother, this justice, who did so much for so many people? We say to her: We thank you, we love you, we will never, ever forget you."

A handful of services allowed users to send messages to larger groups, but they operated in gray areas of the platform&#8217;s T&#38;Cs — until they didn&#8217;t.

The past 10 years has been a crazy ride for news orgs, with the social traffic rush that kicked off in 2013, multiple pivots to video, covid, and the rise and fall of Donald Trump, all while direct publisher traffic started listing downwards and news reader apps stole attention away from on-domain reading.

## How the Heat Dome Stole Christmas

date: 2023-12-19, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDg2MDAyNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MDE0NDgyOX0.akKXblo3T3dohYystP5aOKZpJEel_iCCgvuXqBplWiU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">I’m not normally concerned about having the perfect home — though I’m also not normally interviewing Mr. Christmas Tree himself from my living room, with a scraggly, disco-lit Nordmann fir in the background of my Zoom shot.<br/></p><p>A high-quality tree should have “up-turning branches, so they’re not drooping,” he was telling me. “They have really nice dark green needles” and “what I would consider to be a uniform density, all the way to the top of the tree.” As<strong> </strong>he talked, my eyes slid to the corner of my computer screen, where I noticed that the topper on my rather limp and gappy specimen was also crooked.</p><p>But in the true spirit of the holiday season, Gary Chastagner — a plant pathologist at Washington State University whose extensive research on ornamental holiday conifers has <a href="https://www.technologynetworks.com/genomics/articles/meet-mr-christmas-tree-the-scientist-who-researches-christmas-trees-all-year-round-328515" target="_blank">earned him his jolly nickname</a> — was generous. He added that there’s also a robust market for imperfect “Charlie Brown” Christmas trees, to the point that growers will actually avoid culling arboreal oddballs that might attract people like, well, me.</p><p>Soon, they may not have much choice. The normally cold and rainy Pacific Northwest is the Christmas tree-growing capital of the U.S., producing <a href="http://www.pnwcta.org/news-events/facts-at-a-glance/" target="_blank">more than 5.4 million trees</a> every holiday season, many of which get exported to places like New York, where I procured mine from a sidewalk lot. But back in 2021, a heat dome pushed temperatures in the Northwest to nearly 120 degrees Fahrenheit. The event killed the year’s seedlings and browned new growth on older trees — the consequences of which we’re already seeing in the form of <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2021/11/heat-drought-will-mean-higher-prices-for-northwest-grown-christmas-trees.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">patchy trees and shortages</a>, and will continue to feel for years to come.<strong><strong></strong></strong></p><p>Unlike most farmed products, Christmas trees grow slowly; it can take seven to 12 years for a seedling to reach 8 feet tall, depending on the species. To ensure a consistent stock of Christmas trees for the years ahead, most growers plant the same number of seedlings each season with the expectation that there will be some amount of loss along the way. </p><p>But the heat dome was exceptional; it “killed off virtually every seedling that was planted on farms in 2021, plus some from the year before,” Sheila McKinnon, a former grower and representative of the Puget Sound Christmas Tree Association, in Washington state, told me over email. One dismayed grower <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/06/weather/weather-news-heat-kills-christmas-trees-hawaii-flooding-wxn/index.html" target="_blank">told CNN</a> at the time, “There are literally fields with hundreds of acres of dead seedlings. Just 100% mortality across the entire field.”<br/></p><p>The timing couldn’t have been worse. Because the heat dome occurred in early summer, young trees as well as the new shoots and buds on older trees had not yet “hardened,” and were therefore especially vulnerable to the high temperatures. Additionally, prevailing drought conditions in the Pacific Northwest in 2021 limited the available groundwater to rehydrate the superheated plants. “They just shut down because they couldn’t get enough water; they literally just cooked,” Judith Kowalski, a researcher in the Christmas tree program at Oregon State University, explained to me. </p><p>Not all trees — or tree farms — were affected equally. Nordmann, Turkish, and some Noble firs mature later in the season than Douglas firs, so their tissues were softer and “just fried,” Kowalski said. Regional differences mattered, too. For example, it didn’t get quite as hot in the southern Willamette Valley in Oregon, and trees there faired a little better. But even microclimates could mean the difference between life and death. “On a hill, where there was a breeze, it made a lot of difference,” Kowalski said. By that same token, so did “a little valley, where trees didn’t get any air circulation.”</p><p>Some unlucky growers lost <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2021/12/08/how-this-years-drought-and-heat-dome-affected-christmas-trees/" target="_blank">as much as 90% of the year’s seedlings</a>; by one estimate, 70% of the Noble fir seedlings planted in Oregon in 2021 died. McKinnon sounded fatalistic when she described the damage. “There is no way to recover from this loss,” she said. “Some folks tried to buy more seedlings the following year,” but “instantly doubling the supply wasn’t possible.” </p><p>Call them the Ghosts of Christmas Yet to Come — because conifers take so long to mature, the effects of the 2021 heat dome will cascade into the future, causing shortages of certain trees at certain heights for a decade or more. If the typical Noble fir takes roughly 10 years to grow 8 feet, for example, then the 2021 heat dome could cause shortages of 9-foot-tall Nobles that won’t be felt until 2032.</p><p>The good news is, customers don’t usually shop for a specific species and height of Christmas tree; they just want something that looks good (or, in my case, passable) in their living room. While there might be a 9-foot-tall Noble tree shortage in 2032, customers in the market for a large tree that year will probably switch to buying a Douglas fir or some other variety, instead. Unless a grower depends heavily on one specific type of tree that was widely killed off by the heat dome, the impacts of 2021 can “kind of get absorbed” by the other stock, Kowalski said.</p><p>Of course, all that assumes that there is only <em>one</em> bad year.</p><p>“The heat dome is part of a pattern that we’re seeing of increased frequency of very high temperatures, much more than normal,” Chastagner told me. “2022 was one of the driest summers on record. We only had half of an inch of precipitation during the summer. And unlike other areas, the growers in the Pacific Northwest generally do not irrigate trees.”</p><p>Chastagner’s research indicates that trees in the Pacific Northwest have been so stressed by the region’s dry summers that it’s making them vulnerable to diseases like armillaria, a root rot caused by a fungus, “which we normally didn’t see.” And high temperatures don’t just affect a tree’s growth; warmer autumns also lead to <a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2017/12/christmas-trees-struggle-in-changing-climate/" target="_blank">worse needle retention</a> once the tree is cut, meaning more needles on your floor in mid-December. And while one summer of extreme temperatures might lead to shortages that other stock can absorb, that stops being true when there are <a href="https://www.columbian.com/news/2023/dec/18/washington-state-university-researchers-set-out-to-discover-the-impact-the-2021-heat-dome-had-on-snow-melt-but-what-they-found-revealed-an-alarming-warming-trend/#:~:text=A%20series%20of%20heat%20waves,frequent%20and%20intense%2C%20Reyes%20said." target="_blank">back-to-back heat domes</a>. As Tom Norby, the president of Oregon Christmas Tree Growers Association, <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2021/11/heat-drought-will-mean-higher-prices-for-northwest-grown-christmas-trees.html" target="_blank">told <em>The Oregonian</em> </a>after the 2021 heat dome, “One year is not a catastrophe. Two years becomes a big problem. Three years, it’s a catastrophe.”</p><p>With that in mind, Chastagner and his team at WSU — as well as Kowalski and the researchers at OSU — are exploring everything from introducing irrigation to farms (which is complicated and expensive, but also effective) to determining what conifer varieties will be <a href="https://heatmap.news/is-native-gardening-becoming-pointless" target="_self">better suited to a hotter future</a> in the region. Already, the makeup of tree farms in the West is changing: In 2017, native Noble firs made up about <a href="http://www.pnwcta.org/news-events/facts-at-a-glance/" target="_blank">54% of the trees grown</a> in the Pacific Northwest, with Nordmann and Turkish firs (which are native to Turkey and Georgia) only making up about 4%. Now, <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2021/12/08/how-this-years-drought-and-heat-dome-affected-christmas-trees/" target="_blank">more and more growers</a> are planting exotic Nordmann and Turkish firs due to their drought tolerance.</p><p>But don’t worry: Charlie Brown Christmas trees aren’t going anywhere. Heat or no, there will always be evergreens that require aggressive pruning or otherwise turn out a little bit, well, special. “When I get asked to give talks on what the perfect Christmas tree is,” Chastagner said with — did I only imagine it? — a kindly glance over my shoulder, “I say it’s all in the eye of the beholder.”</p>

<p>A thought -- this kind of feature could not have been offered a year ago. The online world and journalism would never have accepted it from Facebook. But now they're called Meta and that seems to matter. ChatGPT has created a new opening. Not sure I'm going to like it, esp since this is mostly a one-way group. It's not for discussions. But it's the only group they offered to, and I love this stuff and want to know more.</p>
<p>I haven't told the members of the group that I've requested this. Am I obligated to do that?  </p>
<p>Also in private groups where people reveal personal info (not the purpose of this group) I could see where this would be very controversial.</p>

## Pluralistic: What kind of bubble is AI? (19 Dec 2023)

date: 2023-12-19, from: Cory Doctorow's blog

Today's links What kind of bubble is AI?: My latest column for Locus Magazine. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2013, 2018, 2022 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading What kind of bubble is AI? (permalink) My latest column for Locus Magazine is "What Kind of Bubble is AI?" All economic bubbles are hugely destructive, but some of them leave behind wreckage that can be salvaged for useful purposes, while others leave nothing behind but ashes: https://locusmag.com/2023/12/commentary-cory-doctorow-what-kind-of-bubble-is-ai/ Think about some 21st century bubbles. The dotcom bubble was a terrible tragedy, one that drained the coffers of pension funds and other institutional investors and wiped out retail investors who were gulled by Superbowl Ads. But there was a lot left behind after the dotcoms were wiped out: cheap servers, office furniture and space, but far more importantly, a generation of young people who'd been trained as web makers, leaving nontechnical degree programs to learn HTML, perl and python. This created a whole cohort of technologists from non-technical backgrounds, a first in technological history. Many of these people became the vanguard of a more inclusive and humane tech development movement, and they were able to make interesting and useful services and products in an environment where raw materials &#8211; compute, bandwidth, space and talent &#8211; were available at firesale prices. Contrast this with the crypto bubble. It, too, destroyed the fortunes of institutional and individual investors through fraud and Superbowl Ads. It, too, lured in nontechnical people to learn esoteric disciplines at investor expense. But apart from a smattering of Rust programmers, the main residue of crypto is bad digital art and worse Austrian economics. Or think of Worldcom vs Enron. Both bubbles were built on pure fraud, but Enron's fraud left nothing behind but a string of suspicious deaths. By contrast, Worldcom's fraud was a Big Store con that required laying a ton of fiber that is still in the ground to this day, and is being bought and used at pennies on the dollar. AI is definitely a bubble. As I write in the column, if you fly into SFO and rent a car and drive north to San Francisco or south to Silicon Valley, every single billboard is advertising an "AI" startup, many of which are not even using anything that can be remotely characterized as AI. That's amazing, considering what a meaningless buzzword AI already is. So which kind of bubble is AI? When it pops, will something useful be left behind, or will it go away altogether? To be sure, there's a legion of technologists who are learning Tensorflow and Pytorch. These nominally open source tools are bound, respectively, to Google and Facebook's AI environments: https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/18/openwashing/#you-keep-using-that-word-i-do-not-think-it-means-what-you-think-it-means But if those environments go away, those programming skills become a lot less useful. Live, large-scale Big Tech AI projects are shockingly expensive to run. Some of their costs are fixed &#8211; collecting, labeling and processing training data &#8211; but the running costs for each query are prodigious. There's a massive primary energy bill for the servers, a nearly as large energy bill for the chillers, and a titanic wage bill for the specialized technical staff involved. Once investor subsidies dry up, will the real-world, non-hyperbolic applications for AI be enough to cover these running costs? AI applications can be plotted on a 2X2 grid whose axes are "value" (how much customers will pay for them) and "risk tolerance" (how perfect the product needs to be). Charging teenaged D&#38;D players $10 month for an image generator that creates epic illustrations of their characters fighting monsters is low value and very risk tolerant (teenagers aren't overly worried about six-fingered swordspeople with three pupils in each eye). Charging scammy spamfarms $500/month for a text generator that spits out dull, search-algorithm-pleasing narratives to appear over recipes is likewise low-value and highly risk tolerant (your customer doesn't care if the text is nonsense). Charging visually impaired people $100 month for an app that plays a text-to-speech description of anything they point their cameras at is low-value and moderately risk tolerant ("that's your blue shirt" when it's green is not a big deal, while "the street is safe to cross" when it's not is a much bigger one). Morganstanley doesn't talk about the trillions the AI industry will be worth some day because of these applications. These are just spinoffs from the main event, a collection of extremely high-value applications. Think of self-driving cars or radiology bots that analyze chest x-rays and characterize masses as cancerous or noncancerous. These are high value &#8211; but only if they are also risk-tolerant. The pitch for self-driving cars is "fire most drivers and replace them with 'humans in the loop' who intervene at critical junctures." That's the risk-tolerant version of self-driving cars, and it's a failure. More than $100b has been incinerated chasing self-driving cars, and cars are nowhere near driving themselves: https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/09/herbies-revenge/#100-billion-here-100-billion-there-pretty-soon-youre-talking-real-money Quite the reverse, in fact. Cruise was just forced to quit the field after one of their cars maimed a woman &#8211; a pedestrian who had not opted into being part of a high-risk AI experiment &#8211; and dragged her body 20 feet through the streets of San Francisco. Afterwards, it emerged that Cruise had replaced the single low-waged driver who would normally be paid to operate a taxi with 1.5 high-waged skilled technicians who remotely oversaw each of its vehicles: https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/technology/cruise-general-motors-self-driving-cars.html The self-driving pitch isn't that your car will correct your own human errors (like an alarm that sounds when you activate your turn signal while someone is in your blind-spot). Self-driving isn't about using automation to augment human skill &#8211; it's about replacing humans. There's no business case for spending hundreds of billions on better safety systems for cars (there's a human case for it, though!). The only way the price-tag justifies itself is if paid drivers can be fired and replaced with software that costs less than their wages. What about radiologists? Radiologists certainly make mistakes from time to time, and if there's a computer vision system that makes different mistakes than the sort that humans make, they could be a cheap way of generating second opinions that trigger re-examination by a human radiologist. But no AI investor thinks their return will come from selling hospitals that reduce the number of X-rays each radiologist processes every day, as a second-opinion-generating system would. Rather, the value of AI radiologists comes from firing most of your human radiologists and replacing them with software whose judgments are cursorily double-checked by a human whose "automation blindness" will turn them into an OK-button-mashing automaton: https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/23/automation-blindness/#humans-in-the-loop The profit-generating pitch for high-value AI applications lies in creating "reverse centaurs": humans who serve as appendages for automation that operates at a speed and scale that is unrelated to the capacity or needs of the worker: https://pluralistic.net/2022/04/17/revenge-of-the-chickenized-reverse-centaurs/ But unless these high-value applications are intrinsically risk-tolerant, they are poor candidates for automation. Cruise was able to nonconsensually enlist the population of San Francisco in an experimental murderbot development program thanks to the vast sums of money sloshing around the industry. Some of this money funds the inevitabilist narrative that self-driving cars are coming, it's only a matter of when, not if, and so SF had better get in the autonomous vehicle or get run over by the forces of history. Once the bubble pops (all bubbles pop), AI applications will have to rise or fall on their actual merits, not their promise. The odds are stacked against the long-term survival of high-value, risk-intolerant AI applications. The problem for AI is that while there are a lot of risk-tolerant applications, they're almost all low-value; while nearly all the high-value applications are risk-intolerant. Once AI has to be profitable &#8211; once investors withdraw their subsidies from money-losing ventures &#8211; the risk-tolerant applications need to be sufficient to run those tremendously expensive servers in those brutally expensive data-centers tended by exceptionally expensive technical workers. If they aren't, then the business case for running those servers goes away, and so do the servers &#8211; and so do all those risk-tolerant, low-value applications. It doesn't matter if helping blind people make sense of their surroundings is socially beneficial. It doesn't matter if teenaged gamers love their epic character art. It doesn't even matter how horny scammers are for generating AI nonsense SEO websites: https://twitter.com/jakezward/status/1728032634037567509 These applications are all riding on the coattails of the big AI models that are being built and operated at a loss in order to be profitable. If they remain unprofitable long enough, the private sector will no longer pay to operate them. Now, there are smaller models, models that stand alone and run on commodity hardware. These would persist even after the AI bubble bursts, because most of their costs are setup costs that have already been borne by the well-funded companies that created them. These models are limited, of course, though the communities that have formed around them have pushed those limits in surprising ways, far beyond their original manufacturers' beliefs about their capacity. These communities will continue to push those limits for as long as they find the models useful. These standalone, "toy" models are derived from the big models, though. When the AI bubble bursts and the private sector no longer subsidizes mass-scale model creation, it will cease to spin out more sophisticated models that run on commodity hardware (it's possible that federated learning and other techniques for spreading out the work of making large-scale models will fill the gap). So what kind of bubble is the AI bubble? What will we salvage from its wreckage? Perhaps the communities who've invested in becoming experts in Pytorch and Tensorflow will wrestle them away from their corporate masters and make them generally useful. Certainly, a lot of people will have gained skills in applying statistical techniques. But there will also be a lot of unsalvageable wreckage. As big AI models get integrated into the processes of the productive economy, AI becomes a source of systemic risk. The only thing worse than having an automated process that is rendered dangerous or erratic based on AI integration is to have that process fail entirely because the AI suddenly disappeared, a collapse that is too precipitous for former AI customers to engineer a soft landing for their systems. This is a blind spot in our policymakers debates about AI. The smart policymakers are asking questions about fairness, algorithmic bias, and fraud. The foolish policymakers are ensnared in fantasies about "AI safety," AKA "Will the chatbot become a superintelligence that turns the whole human race into paperclips?" https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/27/10-types-of-people/#taking-up-a-lot-of-space But no one is asking, "What will we do if" &#8211; when &#8211; "the AI bubble pops and most of this stuff disappears overnight?"

## Bilateral Tensions Cause the Number of American Students in China to Plummet

date: 2023-12-19, from: VOA News USA

Taipei, Taiwan — Students from China and the U.S. have been traveling between the two countries for decades, playing an important role in cultivating people-to-people ties between the world’s top two economies. However, rising tension between Beijing and Washington in recent years is posing serious threats to this tradition.


During a talk at the Brookings Institute in Washington last week, U.S. ambassador to China Nicholas Burns said there were 15,000 American students in China “six or seven years ago,” but that number dropped to 350 in 2022. While the number of American students rebounded to 700 in 2023, Burns said the number doesn’t represent interest by Washington.




For some American students studying in China, the decision extends from their desire to enrich their understanding of the country and further strengthen their Chinese language skills.


“I’ve studied Chinese for a while, and I think if I don’t go to China, I’ll probably lose my language skills,” Brock Mullen, a student at Johns Hopkins University’s Hopkins-Nanjing Center, told VOA in a call.


As domestic political attitude towards China becomes more negative in the U.S., some students hope their experience in China could help reverse the current trend.


“There is a trend in the U.S. on both sides of the [political] aisle where people want to read about China, but very few want to come here to study China,” Sam Trizza, a student at Hopkins Nanjing Center, told VOA in a video interview, adding that he hopes to discover nuances that should be raised in the China policy landscape in the U.S through his time in China.


Over the last few years, exchanges between American and Chinese students have been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the rising security concerns that Americans have about being physically in China.


Signaling his desire to improve people-to-people ties between China and the U.S., Chinese leader Xi Jinping said during his meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden in San Francisco last month that Beijing is ready to welcome 50,000 American students to China on exchange or study programs in the next five years.




American students remain hesitant about studying in China


While some American officials have also expressed a desire to restart exchanges between students, some students say their programs are facing difficulties recruiting American students to study in China.


“[The goal of our program] is to have about 100 to 150 American students each year, but we only have about 30 American students here [in Nanjing,]” said Mullen from the Hopkins Nanjing Center.


According to him, a factor that causes American students to hesitate about studying in China is the impact of China’s surveillance regime or potentially being arbitrarily detained by Chinese authorities.


“A big reason why [some American students] might feel nervous about coming to China is due to concerns about surveillance or hearing stories about people being arbitrarily thrown into prison or facing exit bans,” he said.


Some current American students say one important value of studying in China is to build up a more thorough understanding of Chinese people’s views on things and the dynamics in China.


“Being in China allows me to better understand what’s happening in the country from sources other than the Chinese government’s statements,” said one American student in China who asked to remain anonymous due to safety concerns.


“You can have more frank conversations with Chinese people and compared to reading about China from the outside, which gives you a passive understanding of China, being in the country allows one to develop a more subtle understanding of Chinese people’s politics and their understanding of what’s going on in China and outside of China,” the student added.


Dispel stereotypes about China in the US


As it remains unclear whether the number of American students studying in China could return to the pre-pandemic level, some academics worry that important elements that help strengthen expertise on China in the U.S. may disappear over time.


“Today, we have a lot of information that we can get from a distance but what I miss the most about regularly going to China is things like the tea breaks at conferences, because that’s the time you can create an intimate space to have a conversation that wasn’t on a set agenda,” said Maggie Lewis, professor of law at Seton Hall University, adding that people can learn nuances through those personal interactions.


In her view, if interactions like this become less frequent, it could have negative impact on Washington’s efforts to manage the relationship with Beijing.


“We need the multifaceted input if we are going to navigate successfully what’s going to be a very challenging relationship between China and the U.S. for the foreseeable future,” Lewis said.




With expertise on China being in high demand in the U.S., Trizza in Nanjing said he believes his in-country experience will make him “a better candidate with more to contribute” to either the public or private sector in the U.S.


“At a time when U.S.-China relations are at an all-time low, person-to-person relationships are like grains of sand in the ocean of international relations, but I know one day we students will be the ones making the waves,” he said. “I want to get involved.”

## Keeping one Game Gear out of the landfill

<p>I was sent a <a href="https://www.zegamamegear.uk/zega-mame-gear">Zega Mame Gear</a> kit by John Maddison, of Zarcade, in April this year. I bought a Game Gear shell off eBay for $15, some extra buttons, switches, screws, and a new glass screen cover from <a href="https://handheldlegend.com">Handheld Legend</a>, and I could <em>finally</em> find a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 for sale last month.</p>

<p>So I put all that together into a modern RetroPie handheld emulation build, and now I can play through games I only <em>wish</em> I could've played in my childhood. Being the third child, I was typically relegated to 'trying to cram in some time on the console before the game rental was due back' status.</p>

## Nikola Founder Trevor Milton Gets Similar Prison Sentence to Defrauder of Holocaust Victim

date: 2023-12-19, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDg2Mjk1MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NTA5NzkxNX0.kPxn7R_uXX_iYYG6naK5AwlKOok5QXdM0XDFenHCDW8/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>Yesterday, a federal judge in Manhattan sentenced Nikola founder Trevor Milton to four years in prison for <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-10/nikola-declines-as-short-seller-accuses-ev-maker-of-deception" target="_blank">lying to his investors</a> about his electric truck startup’s prospects and progress. Last year, a jury <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/14/business/trevor-milton-nikola-verdict/index.html" target="_blank">found Milton guilty</a> on one count of securities fraud and two counts of wire fraud.</p><p>Prosecutors had asked for an 11-year prison term and a $5 million fine. While Milton will be required to pay a $1 million fine, plus an amount of restitution to be determined later, the judge in the case, Edgardo Ramos, said he <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/nikola-founder-trevor-milton-sentenced-to-four-years-in-prison-on-federal-fraud-charges/" target="_blank">took to heart</a> the letters he'd received from Milton’s friends and family attesting to his character. “There were people I’ve sentenced whose offenses were substantially less, but who looked their victims in the eye as they took their last dollar,” Ramos said. Nevertheless, he added, “real people were hurt by your actions.”</p><p>How much people were hurt by Milton’s alleged fabrications was a matter of contention in the trial. Prosecutors claimed retail investors <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-18/nikola-founder-trevor-milton-gets-four-years-for-fraud" target="_blank">lost $660 million</a> as a result of Milton’s false statements — comparable to the $600 million lost by venture capital firms and other bigwigs in the <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/betsy-devoss-family-lost-100-million-in-theranos-investment-2018-05-03" target="_blank">Theranos bust</a> but far less than the $16 billion-worth of online currency that collapsed along with the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/ftx-customers-are-still-grappling-with-crypto-platforms-collapse-2023-10-05/" target="_blank">crypto exchange FTX</a>, of which only $7.3 billion has been recovered so far.</p><p>Nikola went public as <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/why-nikola-decided-to-merge-with-a-spac-and-why-more-such-deals-are-coming-51596369610" target="_blank">part of 2020’s SPAC boom</a>, but shortly after, unnamed insiders told <em>Bloomberg News</em> that Milton had been <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-17/nikola-s-founder-exaggerated-the-capability-of-his-debut-truck" target="_blank">exaggerating</a> what his prototypes could do. At the 2016 unveiling of the Nikola One, a purportedly hydrogen-powered big rig, Milton told onlookers, “We’re going to try to keep people from driving off. This thing fully functions and works.” But people familiar with the set-up for the event told <em>Bloomberg</em> reporters that the engine was missing key components — including a hydrogen fuel cell.</p><p>“I never deceived anyone,” Milton told <em>Bloomberg</em>. “There wasn’t a fuel cell in the truck. We never claimed there was,” although the model in question had “H2 Zero Emission Hydrogen Electric” emblazoned on its side. At the unveiling, Milton said deliveries of the Nikola One would begin in 2020; by 2020, the company still hadn’t published production plans.</p><p>To be fair, scaling an electric vehicle company is extremely difficult. As my colleague Robinson Meyer <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-news-tesla-cybertruck-ford-gm" target="_blank">described it</a>, there comes a put in every EV company's development cycle when “it faces a hold-your-breath moment where its high costs can overwhelm its meager production.” This, he said, is the “valley of death,” which claimed electric bus-maker Proterra <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2023/08/12/proterra-bankruptcy-electric-buses/" target="_blank">earlier this year</a>. </p><p>Perhaps these difficulties contributed to Ramos’s apparent leniency in sentencing, although a quick look at his past cases shows that he wasn’t exaggerating about his past cases. In 2018, he sentenced a 73-year-old found guilty of running a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-paydaylending-sentencing-idUSKBN1J82LP/" target="_blank">$220 million payday lending scheme</a> to 10 years in prison, and a couple months ago he sentenced the co-founder of a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/co-founder-fake-cryptocurrency-scheme-sentenced-20-years-us-prison-2023-09-12/" target="_blank">fake cryptocurrency</a> to 20 years in prison and ordered him to forfeit $300 million. The coup de grâce, though, seems to be the case of a Florida woman named Peaches Stergo who pleaded guilty to <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/ap/ap-u-s-news/ap-florida-woman-who-stole-nearly-3-million-from-holocaust-survivor-gets-over-four-years-in-prison/" target="_blank">defrauding a 87-year-old Holocaust survivor</a> of $2.8 million. Ramos also sentenced her to four years in prison, plus restitution.</p>

## We’ll see partisan media more clearly

date: 2023-12-19, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

In the middle of the 20th century, a certain model of professional journalism reached peak levels of influence in the U.S. This model promised objectivity and non-partisanship, unlike most American journalism that had preceded it. For a few decades, then, the partisan press and the many quandaries partisan journalism had long posed for democracy appeared...

## Julian Assange's 'Final' Appeal Against US Extradition to be Held in February

date: 2023-12-19, from: VOA News USA

LONDON — WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange's possible final legal challenge to stop his extradition from Britain to the United States, where he is wanted on criminal charges, will be held at London's High Court in February, his supporters said on Tuesday.


Assange, 52, is wanted by U.S. authorities on 18 counts, including one under a spying act, relating to WikiLeaks' release of vast troves of confidential U.S. military records and diplomatic cables which Washington said had put lives in danger.


Britain has given the go-ahead for his extradition, but he has been trying to overturn that decision. Campaigners said a public hearing would take place at the High Court on Feb. 20-21, when two judges will review an earlier ruling that had refused Assange permission to appeal.


"The two-day hearing may be the final chance for Julian Assange to prevent his extradition to the United States," WikiLeaks said in a statement.


WikiLeaks first came to prominence in 2010 when it released hundreds of thousands of secret classified files and diplomatic cables in what was the largest security breach of its kind in U.S. military history, which U.S. prosecutors say imperiled the lives of agents named in the leaked material.


Assange's supporters say he is an anti-establishment hero who has been victimized because he exposed U.S. wrongdoing, and that his prosecution is an assault on journalism and free speech.


He spent seven years holed up in Ecuador's embassy in London before he was dragged out and jailed in 2019 for breaching bail conditions. He has been held in prison ever since.


His lawyers have also applied to the European Court of Human Rights which could potentially order the extradition to be blocked.


"The last four and a half years have taken the most considerable toll on Julian and his family, including our two young sons," said his wife Stella, who he married in prison.


"The persecution of this innocent journalist and publisher must end."

## What Two Record-Breaking Floods Taught Vermont

date: 2023-12-19, from: Heatmap News

On a typical morning, the water moves quickly and is shallow enough that you can see the rocks under the surface. </p><p>But when a storm comes through, long-time resident Angela Johnson warns, this steady stream can turn treacherous.</p><p>“We watch it every day when it’s raining — it doesn’t matter if it’s a heavy storm, the brook rises quite quickly,” Johnson told me. “It has and it will continue to break out of its space and cause flooding.”</p><p>That’s what happened four years ago, when an ice jam caused the brook to burst, flooding into the houses in the low-lying surrounding area. Or during <a href="https://www.weather.gov/safety/flood-states-vt" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tropical Storm Irene</a> in 2011, which destroyed 29 homes in the greater Tri-Park Housing Cooperative, of which Mountain Home is a member. The rushing water lifted some structures right off their foundations, damaged roadways, and left a trail of debris, photos, and furniture among the wreckage in its wake. </p><p>Manufactured homes (which the state of Vermont uses interchangeably with mobile homes, though that term that refers only to models made before 1976) were disproportionately impacted during Irene, making up 7% of the state’s housing stock but <a href="https://floodready.vermont.gov/sites/floodready/files/documents/2013-IRO-final-report%20reduced.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">15%</a> of housing damaged during the storm. Across the U.S., one of seven manufactured homes is in a neighborhood with high flood risk, according to a Headwaters Economics <a href="https://headwaterseconomics.org/natural-hazards/mobile-home-flood-risk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">analysis</a>, a figure that is only expected to rise due to climate change. </p><p>Vermont has recognized this risk, making changes at the state, local, and community levels that have earned it <a href="https://nexusmedianews.com/mobile-homes-offer-low-cost-living-now-theyre-threatened-by-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">national recognition</a> as a model for mitigating flood risk in these particularly vulnerable neighborhoods. To better understand what some of these strategies looked like, I went to Vermont earlier this year and met with residents, officials, and researchers who shared their experiences working or living — or both — in manufactured home parks.</p><p>Or rather, I tried to. On my first attempt to visit, I made it about 45 minutes into my four-hour drive before I had to turn around due to flooding, an irony that was certainly not lost on me. When I finally made it up to Tri-Park the next day, there was still water pooled in front of homes and alongside the road, hinting at the areas that might be particularly vulnerable to the next storm. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Mountain Home Brook.</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Colleen Hagerty</small></p><p>Weeks later, Vermont was in the headlines for flooding once again. An <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/vermont-rain-storm-flooding-climate" target="_self">unnamed storm</a> drenched the state in July, causing “<a href="https://www.weather.gov/btv/The-Great-Vermont-Flood-of-10-11-July-2023-Preliminary-Meteorological-Summary" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">catastrophic</a>” impacts and earning quick comparisons to Tropical Storm Irene. More than <a href="https://apnews.com/article/vermont-flooding-housing-mobile-home-parks-f07ba8c0f8b94f08715c132a736bd574" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2,900 homes</a> were damaged across the state, hundreds of them significantly, including dozens of manufactured homes. “Flooding had outsized impact on 4 Vermont mobile home communities,” announced the <a href="https://www.wcax.com/2023/08/01/flooding-had-outsized-impact-4-vermont-mobile-home-communitites/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">headline</a> from one local news organization, which placed the loss at more than 60 manufactured homes. </p><p>So, did any of the changes implemented after Irene make a difference? It’s a tricky question, said Kelly Hamshaw, a researcher with the University of Vermont. She’s been visiting and interviewing residents in manufactured housing communities since 2011 and is currently working to identify needs in areas impacted by this summer’s storm.</p><p>For starters, the flooding footprints of the two storms were different, meaning those hardest-hit by one were not necessarily as impacted by the other. The flooded areas are still in the early stages of recovery, so it’s difficult to step back and make clear comparisons. Other less visible interventions, though, have certainly paid off, she told me.</p><p>Take accessing aid — <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01944363.2021.1952477" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">researchers</a> say the specific needs of manufactured homeowners are often overlooked in laws dealing with flood damage. Typically, owners of manufactured homes buy the structure they live in but not the land beneath it, which they rent from a distinct owner or corporation. Since most government assistance is aimed at either single-family homeowners or renters, Headwaters Economics research found that manufactured homeowners are “more likely to face barriers in <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frwa.2021.752307/full" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accessing</a> federal and state assistance, more likely to experience long-term recovery problems, and more likely to be <a href="https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/%28ASCE%29NH.1527-6996.0000357" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">permanently displaced</a>.” </p><p>In the aftermath of Irene, for instance, most damaged manufactured homes had to be condemned to receive a full payout from the Federal Emergency Management Agency; those payouts often amounted to less than the value of the homes and left their owners without anywhere to live. Other types of homes did not require condemnation for their owners to receive that full payout. </p><p>This was a discrepancy the state recognized more readily this time, though it still has required additional interventions to address. In response to this summer’s storm, Vermont has rolled out new programs specifically aimed at damaged manufactured home <a href="https://www.vermontpublic.org/local-news/2023-08-15/state-program-will-pay-for-removal-of-mobile-homes-damaged-by-vermont-floods" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">removal</a> and <a href="https://www.vermontpublic.org/local-news/2023-09-19/vermont-announces-flood-money-for-manufactured-home-owners-when-fema-aid-comes-up-short" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">funding</a> for those who received insufficient payouts from FEMA. A state <a href="https://www.wcax.com/2023/08/24/legislative-task-force-examining-mobile-home-policy-following-flooding/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">legislative task force</a> is also working to better understand the economics and issues related to manufactured housing in hopes of addressing policy gaps.</p><p>Because it’s not just a challenge accessing aid. Other types of homeowners also have more options when they’re ready to start moving on. </p><p>Stephanie Smith, hazard mitigation officer for Vermont Emergency Management, said buyouts were a key tool when it came to single-family homes after Irene. In those cases, the typical model was to pay 75% of the value of a property, an amount that was often significantly higher than the maximum FEMA payout, and gave the homeowner funds towards purchasing a new property. But this approach wasn’t feasible for manufactured homeowners, Smith told me. While many single-family homes appreciate in value over time, Smith said the value of a manufactured home often diminishes over time due to age and wear. And unlike single-family homes, in which the entire property goes into the valuation, manufactured home owners typically own just the structure they live in, paying rent on the actual land beneath it to a landlord. </p><p>So, based on just the value of that building, the payout these homeowners would receive would not be “anywhere near enough” to cover purchasing a new structure and paying lot rent, according to Smith. </p><p>Aging infrastructure is an issue in Tri-Park, from older homes to public offerings like the bridges and sewage systems, all of which can make the community more vulnerable to flooding. To address these compounding challenges, Tri-Park, where Johnson lives, developed a multimillion-dollar master plan with the input of government officials, residents, board members, and developers. It calls for funding infrastructure upgrades, including fixing up sewers and bridges over the brook, and proposes a new approach to buyouts. Instead of paying the 25 residents living in floodplains a percentage for their homes, Tri-Park will offer them new, eco-friendly manufactured homes located at a higher elevation within the same community. </p><p>The plan has multiple public and private supporters, including Smith’s department, which is providing the park with $2 million to purchase those new homes through the state’s Flood Resilient Communities Fund. At this point, both the plans and the funds to make this idea a reality are largely in place. </p><p>What’s still missing: Fewer than half of the minimum 25 households necessary to move forward have agreed to move. Residents have been hearing about the plan as a hypothetical for years while the board worked with partners and looked for capital. But board members and residents alike acknowledge there is a lot of skepticism around the plan’s promises. One challenge is that the new lots are expected to be smaller, and residents might not be able to have the same sort of layouts or amenities they currently enjoy.</p><p>To address these concerns, the Tri-Park board — which is open for residents to join — has hosted resident meetings and is offering a chance to tour models of the new types of homes they will be building. Which brings up another resiliency strategy more than a dozen parks have adopted since Irene: becoming resident-owned. Vermont law requires landowners of manufactured home parks to give notice to all lessees if they intend to sell the property, giving residents first dibs on purchasing the land. To do so, homeowners often opt to work with a nonprofit or establish a resident-owned cooperative, in which the residents become shareholders. Tri-Park is the largest of the 67 nonprofit or resident-owned manufactured home parks in the state, giving its residents an opportunity to have a voice in these larger park decisions. </p><p>Help from Cooperative Development Institute and Resident-Owned Communities has been a key part of this movement, local officials said. Julia Curry, who works for CDI in Vermont, says the biggest benefit in switching to a resident-owned model is security, as things like lot rent cannot be changed without resident input. </p><p>“Now the residents themselves — the members of the co-op — are setting their annual budgets,” Curry explained. </p><p>Aside from ensuring prices remain reasonable, that can also allow for prioritizing and accounting for risks like flooding. Last Christmas, a winter storm sent Sandy Jarvis’s Christmas into chaos. A mixture of high winds, rain, and snow over Northwestern Vermont caused the St. George Community Cooperative, where Jarvis has lived for nearly a decade, to lose power. Like Mountain Home, even an average storm causes large puddles to form in the low-lying neighborhood. But the Christmas flood sprang from another source — frozen pipes that cracked and leaked, draining the community’s well system. </p><p>For Jarvis, this was a warning sign. Since then, she’s been working to establish an emergency plan in the community and budget for a generator that could keep the water supply running during power outages. When the heavy rains came through this summer, she said, they were mostly spared, though they did lose power again and dealt with some flooding. </p><p>“Most mobile home communities in the state are old, and there's a lot of aging infrastructure,” Jarvis told me. Reflecting on their luck compared to other communities in the state, she later added, “We came out of it fairly well.”</p><p>Bill Dunton, another resident of the St. George development, has lived there nearly 25 years, through the transition to a cooperative; he’s witnessed flooding and the aftermath. Making changes can be difficult, he acknowledges, particularly in a neighborhood that has “118 families — and 118 different attitudes.” Still, Dunton believes the co-op model is ultimately supportive for residents, as it eliminates the fear of losing their homes or getting priced out with no notice, something Hamshaw from the University of Vermont said is not unusual in the state’s “bonkers” housing market, even after disasters.</p><p>Concerns over lot rent, which manufactured housing residents can still be charged after being displaced, and accessing aid are among the issues Hamshaw has heard since the summer storm. With the ground now frosting over at night as winter weather settles in, Hamshaw worries about the residents still in the thick of post-disaster bureaucracy. She’s currently interviewing displaced residents, many of whom are couch surfing or living in campers as they await aid. Even once they receive funds, she stressed that the housing market is significantly different now than it was after Irene, with everything from rent to repairs costing more, let alone new housing units. </p><p>That’s why Dunton, sitting inside his warm home as a light drizzle fell outside, said he hopes the state can come to see communities like St. George the way he does: as one of the last vestiges of actually affordable housing. And that, he believes, is well worth investing in for the long haul. </p><p><em>Support for this story was provided by The Neal Peirce Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting journalism on ways to make cities and their larger regions work better for all people.</em></p>

## Music at The Colony

date: 2023-12-19, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I went to my first since-pandemic live show, at <a href="https://www.colonywoodstock.com/">The Colony</a> in Woodstock. It's small venue that <a href="https://buildingsofnewengland.com/2022/09/11/the-colony-hotel-1927/">goes way back</a>. It's basically a bar, with a stage and a small seating area which can hold about 50 people, seated at tables. Very comfortable space. Woodstock as you might imagine is a great place for live music, one of the reasons I moved here, the other being that it's a magnet for creative people, like a lot of the other places I've lived (New Orleans, Cambridge, Berkeley, Madison, Seattle, New York). But the pandemic squashed that, now maybe we're starting to come back. </p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/12/19/levinBrothers.png"></center>The Levin Brothers band at The Colony, Sunday night. </div></p>
<p>I decided to risk it because a friend was playing last night, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Levin">Tony Levin</a>, who I know through his wife, Andi. When I first met Tony, at a birthday dinner last year, I thought he was a banker. He's tall, an impressive-looking person, like the people who rose to be an executive at companies like IBM in the 80s. Just shows how deceiving appearances can be. He's an accomplished musician, and a very sweet, quiet person. Probably about as far from an IBM exec or banker as you can get. Until Sunday I had never seen him perform.  </p>
<p>The group I was with arrived early, and Tony was at the front door, greeting people as we entered, and immediately he made a very different impression. He seemed soft, hippieish, relaxed, smiling. Later I realized this may have been the first time I'd seen him in his element. And the show, a four-piece jazz band, with his brother <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Levin">Pete Levin</a> on piano, started off playing (to my uneducated ear) pretty plain improvisational jazz. But as the show went on, I could see that this music had been composed, and had all kinds of themes running through it. It seemed to me the music had been cultivated over many years? </p>
<p>The Levins and friends, are roughly my age. I imagined they had been playing together as long as I have been making software. And I felt certain what I was seeing here were two very talented brothers, who have been performing together their whole lives, and there was something I had been trying to understand about myself, how I feel about my art, almost fifty years after I started. There is an important difference in how I do it at 68 vs how I did it when I was 22. Exactly how it is different, I'm probably too close to it to really understand, but seeing what I imagined to being something similar in two people I kind of know, that was thought-provoking.</p>
<p>To me, music is as software probably is to most people who use it. I love it, but I don't have much of an idea of how it's made. The last few years I've been reintroduced to it in a new way, <a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/01/144612.html?title=theBeatlesWereAnInvention">thanks</a> to <a href="http://scripting.com/2022/01/25/144824.html?title=imABeatleshead">the</a> <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/series/the-beatles-get-back/7DcWEeWVqrkE">Get Back documentary</a>, which gave us a view into the Beatles' creative process, something I wish I could have seen when I was much younger. The Beatles were the music my generation grew up with, but I never really even understood that there was a difference between a John song and a Paul song. </p>
<p>The second great influence has been Andrew Hickey's <a href="https://500songs.com/">500 songs</a> podcast. Now I have so many more stories to go with the music that my life was formed by. And I have a feeling that attending this event on Sunday will turn out to be a similar influence. </p>
<p>Now, what music should I go see next? <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">💥</span></p>

## Publishers’ short video strategy is put to the test

date: 2023-12-19, from: Nieman Journalism Lab

2024 is a strange year. It will see four-year elections in the U.S. (the world’s richest economy and democracy) and five-year elections in India (the world’s most populous country and largest democracy) coincide. All this will happen against the context of an uncertain economy. Will things continue to cool down for businesses and job growth,...

## Podcasting goes bionic

Ask anyone in podcasting, and they’ll tell you that 2023 was not an easy year for the audio industry. Not by a long shot. Major podcast players and platforms — from NPR and Pushkin Industries to Spotify, Stitcher, and Amazon Music — were plagued by massive layoffs. A long list of acclaimed and beloved shows — including Pulitzer...

## How to get compensated for future Southwest Airlines delays

date: 2023-12-19, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Southwest Airlines is being fined $140 million by the U.S. Department of Transportation after last year’s holiday travel meltdown. But the majority of that money will go toward compensating future Southwest customers who arrive at their destination three or more hours late — if the issues were caused by something under the airline’s control. Plus, one state put a price tag on untreated mental illness. The costs were staggering.</p>

Some EU countries pledge to decarbonize power systems by 2035</h3><p style=""><strong></strong>A handful of countries within the European Union have <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=bcc2d58007&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pledged</a> to decarbonize their power systems by 2035. The group includes France and Germany, the two biggest power producers in Europe. They’re joined in the commitment by the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Switzerland, which is not in the EU but is aligned with the bloc’s climate policies. Current EU emissions goals aim for decarbonization by 2040, but this group believes they can move more quickly, and by working together they hope to streamline infrastructure installation and grid connectivity. “Cutting carbon from the electricity grid is seen as a crucial first step to removing emissions from the wider energy system,” <em>Bloomberg Green </em><a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=3c32297d7e&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explains</a>.</p><h3 style="">2. Houthi attacks on ships send oil prices higher</h3><p style=""><strong></strong>The price of oil shot up yesterday on growing concerns about tankers being attacked by Houthi rebels in the Red Sea. BP paused shipments through the channel, joining shipping giants including AP Moller-Maersk, MSC, and Hapag-Lloyd. The Red Sea offers a quick route from Asia to Europe, making it one of the world’s busiest shipping channels. It handles about 15% of global shipping, or 20,000 vessels each year, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=8e65ee6391&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a> <em>The Times</em> of London. Since the beginning of the war between Israel and Hamas, Iran-backed Houthi rebels based in Yemen have been attacking ships with links to Israel. Lately the attacks have expanded to include ships with no Israeli ties. On Monday a Norwegian-owned vessel was attacked. The price of brent crude jumped by as much as 3% on the BP news, but “ample oil supply limited price gains,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=c9868a5f2f&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">says</a> <em>Reuters</em>.</p><div class="horizontal-rule"></div><p><em>Get Heatmap AM directly in your inbox:</em></p><p><div id="mc_embed_signup"><form action="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=c5c20b220f&f_id=00a03fe3f0" class="validate" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" method="post" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" target="_self"><div id="mc_embed_signup_scroll"><div class="indicates-required"><span class="asterisk">*</span> indicates required</div><div class="mc-field-group"><label for="mce-EMAIL">Email Address  <span class="asterisk">*</span></label><input class="required email" id="mce-EMAIL" name="EMAIL" placeholder="Your Email" required="" type="email" value=""/><span class="helper_text" id="mce-EMAIL-HELPERTEXT"></span><a class="policy__link" href="/privacy-statement">Our Privacy Policy & Terms Apply.</a></div>

House Democrats sound alarm about major owner of oil and gas wells</h3><p style=""><strong></strong>Democrats in the House of Representatives have <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=714990966b&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">launched an inquiry</a> into the company that owns the most oil and gas wells in the U.S., saying its business model poses a massive climate risk. Diversified Energy Co. owns about 65,000 oil and gas wells, <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=3e5fb4c3a8&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a>. It buys old and unproductive wells and tries to keep them on life support. Members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee worry Diversified could suddenly decide to abandon the wells, leaving state governments with a hefty bill for cleanup and raising the risk of massive methane leaks. Methane is an extremely potent greenhouse gas, and already Diversified was the fourth-largest methane emitter among oil and gas producers last year, according to the EPA. “Diversified Energy’s strategy of leaving thousands of marginal wells unplugged for decades and potentially underestimating future cleanup costs could undermine important efforts to fight climate change,” committee members <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=4e71606c36&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> in a letter.</p><h3 style="">4.

Contrails are the clouds that build up in the sky behind jets as their engines spew hot air and soot into the atmosphere. The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) posits that contrails could have a bigger warming effect than burning jet fuel, because contrails reflect heat back toward the ground. “It’s a big contributor and we need to worry about it,” MIT researcher Florian Allroggen <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=016855147f&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tells</a> <em>The Washington Post</em>. Airlines including Delta, KLM, and American are working with researchers to identify and test ways to eliminate contrails, which might mean flying at higher or lower altitudes to avoid routes with the coldest, wettest air. One recent <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=f1f74ae7b5&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> found that rerouting 1.7% of flights could cut contrail warming by 59%.</p><h3>5. Kentucky is getting a massive solar farm next year</h3><p style=""><strong></strong>Construction has begun on what will eventually be Kentucky’s largest solar farm. The project, called Unbridled, is scheduled to come online in 2024. It will be able to power 120,000 homes with clean energy every year, and will provide around $42 million in direct economic impact over the first 20 years of operation, <em>Electrek</em>’s Michelle Lewis <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=ce986bc0da&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a>. “This 160 MW solar farm is a milestone for Kentucky, the fifth-largest coal-producing state in the U.S.” Lewis says. “Coal is at a point of no return, and renewables will provide clean electricity and substantial economic benefits. It’s encouraging that Kentucky is starting to embrace renewables.”</p><h2 style="">THE KICKER</h2><p style="">Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly building a $270 million compound in Hawaii that will have its own food and energy supplies, and a 5,000-square-foot underground bunker.</p>

## OpenAI Is Not Training on Your Dropbox Documents—Today

<p>There&#8217;s a rumor flying around the Internet that OpenAI is training foundation models on your Dropbox documents.</p>

<p>It seems not to be true. Dropbox isn&#8217;t sharing all of your documents with OpenAI. But here&#8217;s the problem: we don&#8217;t trust OpenAI. We don&#8217;t trust tech corporations. And&#8212;to be fair&#8212;corporations in general. We have no reason to.</p>

Reporters at ProPublica have uncovered yet more news about the right-wing network of wealthy donors who have supported Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas. According to Justin Elliott, Joshua Kaplan, Alex Mierjeski, and Brett Murphy, in January 2000, on a plane flight home from a conservative conference, Thomas complained to Representative Cliff Stearns (R-FL) about his salary. He warned that if lawmakers didn&#8217;t give Supreme Court justices a pay raise, &#8220;one or more justices will leave soon.&#8221;

## Marvel, Disney Drop Actor Jonathan Majors After Assault Conviction

date: 2023-12-19, from: VOA News USA

New York — Jonathan Majors was convicted Monday of assaulting his former girlfriend after a trial that he hoped would vindicate him and restore his status as an emerging Hollywood star. It did just the opposite: Marvel Studios and the Walt Disney Co. dropped him hours after the verdict.


A Manhattan jury found Majors, 34, guilty of one misdemeanor assault charge and one harassment violation stemming from his March confrontation with then-girlfriend Grace Jabbari. She said he attacked her in a car and left her in “excruciating” pain; his lawyers said Jabbari was the aggressor.


Majors, who was acquitted of a different assault charge and of aggravated harassment, looked slightly downward and showed no immediate reaction as the verdict was read. He declined to comment as he left the courthouse.


His lawyer, Priya Chaudhry, said in a statement that he “still has faith in the process and looks forward to fully clearing his name.” While he was convicted of an assault charge that involves recklessly causing injury, she said his team was grateful for his acquittal on the other assault count, which concerned intentionally causing injury.


“Mr. Majors is grateful to God, his family, his friends and his fans for their love and support during these harrowing eight months,” Chaudhry said.


Marvel and Disney immediately dropped the “Creed III” star from all upcoming projects following the conviction, said a person close to the studio who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to speak publicly on the matter.


Before his arrest, Majors had been on track to become a central figure throughout the Marvel Cinematic Universe, playing the antagonist role of Kang. Majors had already appeared in “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” and the first two seasons of “Loki.” He was to star in “Avengers: The Kang Dynasty,” dated for release in May 2026.


Majors, whose credits include “The Last Black Man in San Francisco,” “Devotion” and “Da 5 Bloods,” had been one of the fastest-rising stars in Hollywood. The Yale School of Drama graduate also starred as a troubled amateur bodybuilder in “Magazine Dreams,” which made an acclaimed debut at the Sundance Film Festival in January and was set to open in theaters this month. Ahead of Majors’ trial, Disney-owned distributor Searchlight Pictures removed “Magazine Dreams” from its release calendar.


Majors' sentencing was set for Feb. 6. He faces the possibility of up to a year in jail for the assault conviction, though probation or other non-jail sentences also are possible.


Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said in a statement that the trial “illustrated a cycle of psychological and emotional abuse, and escalating patterns of coercion.”


The dispute between Majors and Jabbari began in the backseat of a chauffeured car and spilled into the streets of Manhattan.


Jabbari, a 30-year-old British dancer, accused Majors of hitting her in the head with his open hand, twisting her arm behind her back and squeezing her middle finger until it fractured.


Majors’ lawyers alleged that she flew into a jealous rage after reading a text message — from another woman — on his phone. They said Jabbari had spread a “fantasy” to take down the actor, who was only trying to regain his phone and get away safely.


But as Majors sought vindication from the jury, the trial also brought forth new evidence about his troubled relationship with Jabbari, whom he met on the set of “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” two years ago.


Prosecutors shared text messages that showed the actor begging Jabbari not to seek hospital treatment for an earlier head injury. One message warned “it could lead to an investigation even if you do lie and they suspect something.”


They also played audio of Majors declaring himself a “great man,” then questioning whether Jabbari could meet the high standards set by the spouses of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Barack Obama. Majors’ attorneys countered that Jabbari had surreptitiously recorded her boyfriend as part of a plot to “destroy” his career.


Over four days of tearful testimony, Jabbari said Majors was excessively controlling and prone to fits of explosive rage that left her afraid “physically quite a lot.” She broke down on the witness stand as a jury watched security footage of him pushing her back into the car after the backseat confrontation. Prosecutors described the video as showing Majors “manhandling” her and shoving her into the vehicle “as if she was a doll.”


Majors arrived in the courtroom each morning carrying a gold-leaf Bible, accompanied by family members and his current girlfriend, actress Meagan Good. Expressionless for much of the testimony, he wiped away tears as Chaudhry urged jurors during her closing arguments on Thursday to “end this nightmare for Jonathan Majors.”


Majors did not take the stand. But Chaudhry said her client was the victim of “white lies, big lies, and pretty little lies” invented by Jabbari to exact revenge on an unfaithful partner.


The attorney cited security footage, taken immediately after the shove, that showed Majors sprinting away from his girlfriend as she chased him through the night. Jabbari then followed a group of strangers she’d met on the street to a dance club, where she ordered drinks for the group and did not appear to be favoring her injured hand.


“She was revenge-partying and charging Champagne to the man she was angry with and treating these strangers to fancy Champagne she bought with Jonathan’s credit card,” Chaudhry alleged.


The next morning, after finding Jabbari unconscious in the closet of their Manhattan penthouse, Majors called police. He was arrested at the scene, while Jabbari was transported to a hospital to receive treatment for the injuries to her ear and hand.


“He called 911 out of concern for her, and his fear of what happens when a Black man in America came true,” Chaudhry said, accusing police and prosecutors of failing to take seriously Majors’ allegations that he was bloodied and scratched during the dispute.


In her closing arguments, prosecutor Kelli Galaway said Majors was following a well-worn playbook used by abusers to cast their victims as attackers.


“This is not a revenge plot to ruin the defendant’s life or his career,” Galaway said. “You were asked why you are here? Because domestic violence is serious.”
