it was partnering with Banana Pi to design and sell the first router […]

imitation on data from human labelers. Instead of the mysticism of
“asking an AI”, think of it more as “asking the average data labeler” on
the internet. … But

<h2 id="faqs-are-not-the-answer">FAQs are not the answer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-30, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti</p>
<p>
Everybody loves to hate Frequently Asked Questions, or FAQs. More often
than not, technical writers pale and stagger at the sight of hefty,
unsorted FAQs, as if they were beholding a writhing mass of primal
chaos. Others value their pragmatic qualities: FAQs, they say, lower the
bar to contribution and are good fuel for LLMs and search engines. My
opinion is that FAQs pose a problem only when there’s no strategy around
their usage.
