<h2 id="chatgpt-is-my-css-advisor">ChatGPT is my CSS advisor</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
People who don’t program must not have any idea how much of a boon it is to us programmers.
</p>
<p>
I am doing CSS coding far in advance of my previous capability, when I know something is possible, but I haven’t the slightest idea how to specify it.
</p>
<p>
For example, a very common thing to want to do is to put a : after every the text in the first column of a table.
</p>
<p>
So I asked ChatGPT how to do it, in English, exactly as I did above. This is what it came up with:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>tr td:first-child::after {content: “:”;}</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
When you see it like that you can almost figure out what’s going on.
</p>
<p>
And it works. I literally shrieked when it did.
</p>
<p>
Now I am the boss of CSS..
</p>
<p>
Nice.

That’s more than many lenders advise and comes as a wave of millennials and Gen Zers look toward homeownership. Also on the show: Apple watches, consumer confidence, and Turkey’s painfully interest rates.

<h2 id="pluralistic-a-year-in-illustration-2023-edition-21-dec-2023">Pluralistic: A year in illustration, 2023 edition (21 Dec 2023)</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links A year in illustration, 2023 edition: I amuse myself, at least. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2013, 2018, 2022 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading A year in illustration, 2023 edition (permalink) I am objectively very bad at visual art. I am bad at vision, period – I’m astigmatic, shortsighted, color blind, and often miss visual details others see. I can’t even draw a stick-figure. To top things off, I have cataracts in both eyes and my book publishing/touring schedule is so intense that I keep having to reschedule the surgeries. But despite my vast visual deficits, I thoroughly enjoy making collages for this blog. For many years now – decades – I’ve been illustrating my blog posts by mixing public domain and Creative Commons art with work that I can make a good fair use case for. As bad as art as I may be, all this practice has paid off. Call it unseemly, but I think I’m turning out some terrific illustrations – not all the time, but often enough. Last year, I rounded up my best art of the year: https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/25/a-year-in-illustration/ And I liked reflecting on the year’s art so much, I decided I’d do it again. Be sure to scroll to the bottom for some downloadables – freely usable images that I painstakingly cut up with the lasso tool in The Gimp. The original AD&amp;D hardcover cover art is seared into my psyche. For several years, there were few images I looked at so closely as these. When Hasbro pulled some world-beatingly sleazy stuff with the Open Gaming License, I knew just how to mod Dave Trampier’s ‘Eve Of Moloch’ from the cover of the Players’ Handbook. Thankfully, bigger nerds than me have identified all the fonts in the image, making the remix a doddle. https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/12/beg-forgiveness-ask-permission/#whats-a-copyright-exception Even though I don’t keep logs or collect any analytics, I can say with confidence that “Tiktok’s Enshittification” was the most popular thing I published on Pluralistic this year. I mixed some public domain Brother’s Grimm art, mixed with a classic caricature of Boss Tweed, and some very cheesy royalty-free/open access influencer graphics. One gingerbread cottage social media trap, coming up: https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys To illustrate the idea of overcoming walking-the-plank fear (as a metaphor for writing when it feels like you suck) I mixed public domain stock of a plank, a high building and legs, along with a procedurally generated Matrix “code waterfall” and a vertiginous spiral ganked from a Heinz Bunse photo of a German office lobby. https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/22/walking-the-plank/ Finding a tasteful way to illustrate a story about Johnson &amp; Johnson losing a court case after it spent a generation tricking women into dusting their vulvas with asbestos-tainted talcum was a challenge. The tulip (featured in many public domain images) was a natural starting point. I mixed it with Jesse Wagstaff’s image of a Burning Man dust-storm and Mike Mozart’s shelf-shot of a J&amp;J talcum bottle. https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/01/j-and-j-jk/#risible-gambit “Google’s Chatbot Panic” is about Google’s long history of being stampeded into doing stupid things because its competitors are doing them. Once it was Yahoo, now it’s Bing. Tenniel’s Tweedle Dee and Dum were a good starting point. I mixed in one of several Humpty Dumpty editorial cartoon images from 19th century political coverage that I painstakingly cut out with the lasso tool on a long plane-ride. This is one of my favorite Humpties, I just love the little 19th C businessmen trying to keep him from falling! I finished it off with HAL 9000’s glowing red eye, my standard ‘this is about AI’ image, which I got from Cryteria’s CC-licensed SVG. https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/16/tweedledumber/#easily-spooked Though I started writing about Luddites in my January, 2022 Locus column, 2023 was the Year of the Luddite, thanks to Brian Merchant’s outstanding Blood In the Machine: https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/26/enochs-hammer/#thats-fronkonsteen When it came time to illustrate “Gig Work Is the Opposite of Steampunk,” I found a public domain weaver’s loft, and put one of Cryteria’s HAL9000 eyes in the window. Magpie Killjoy’s Steampunk Magazine poster, ‘Love the Machine, Hate the Factory,’ completed the look. https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/12/gig-work-is-the-opposite-of-steampunk/ For the “small, non-profit school” that got used as an excuse to bail out Silicon Valley Bank, I brought back Humpty Dumpty, mixing him with a Hogwartsian castle, a brick wall texture, and an ornate, gilded frame. I love how this one came out. This Humpty was made for the SVB bailout. https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/23/small-nonprofit-school/#north-country-school The RESTRICT Act would have federally banned Tiktok – a proposal that was both technically unworkable and unconstitutional. I found an early 20th century editorial cartoon depicting Uncle Sam behind a fortress wall that was keeping a downtrodden refugee family out of America. I got rid of most of the family, giving the dad a Tiktok logo head, and I put Cryteria’s HAL9000 eyes over each cannonmouth. Three Boss Tweed moneybag-head caricatures, adorned with Big Tech logos, rounded it out. https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/30/tik-tok-tow/#good-politics-for-electoral-victories When Flickr took decisive action to purge the copyleft trolls who’d been abusing its platform, I knew I wanted to illustrate this with Lucifer being cast out of heaven, and the very best one of those comes from John Milton, who is conveniently well in the public domain. The Flickr logo suggested a bicolored streaming-light-of-heaven motif that just made it. https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/01/pixsynnussija/#pilkunnussija Old mainframe ads are a great source of stock for a “Computer Says No” image. And Congress being a public building, there are lots of federal (and hence public domain) images of its facade. https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/04/cbo-says-no/#wealth-tax When I wrote about the Clarence Thomas/Harlan Crow bribery scandal, it was easy to find Mr. Kjetil Ree’s great image of the Supreme Court building. Thomas being a federal judge, it was easy to find a government photo of his head, but it’s impossible to find an image of him in robes at a decent resolution. Luckily, there are tons of other federal judges who’ve been photographed in their robes! Boss Tweed with the dollar-sign head was a great stand-in for Harlan Crow (no one knows what he looks like anyway). Gilding Thomas’s robes was a simple matter of superimposing a gold texture and twiddling with the layers. https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/06/clarence-thomas/#harlan-crow “Gig apps trap reverse centaurs in wage-stealing Skinner boxes” is one of my best titles. This is the post where I introduce the idea of “twiddling” as part of the theory of enshittification, and explain how it relates to “reverse centaurs” – people who assist machines, rather than the other way around. Finding a CC licensed modular synth was much harder than I thought, but I found Stephen Drake’s image and stitched it into a mandala. Cutting out the horse’s head for the reverse centaur was a lot of work (manes are a huuuuge pain in the ass), but I love how his head sits on the public domain high-viz-wearing warehouse worker’s body I cut up (thanks, OSHA!). Seeing as this is an horrors-of-automation story, Cryteria’s HAL9000 eyes make an appearance. https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/12/algorithmic-wage-discrimination/#fishers-of-men Rockefeller’s greatest contribution to our culture was inspiring many excellent unflattering caricatures. The IWW’s many-fists-turning-into-one-fist image made it easy to have the collective might of workers toppling the original robber-baron. https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/14/aiming-at-dollars/#not-men I link to this post explaining how to make good Mastodon threads at least once a week, so it’s a good thing the graphic turned out so well. Close-cropping the threads from a public domain yarn tangle worked out great. Eugen Rochko’s Mastodon logo was and is the only Affero-licensed image ever to appear on Pluralistic. https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/16/how-to-make-the-least-worst-mastodon-threads/ I spent hours on the sofa one night painstakingly cutting up and reassembling the cover art from a science fiction pulp. I have a folder full of color-corrected, high-rez scans from an 18th century anatomy textbook, and the cross-section head-and-brain is the best of the lot. https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/04/analytical-democratic-theory/#epistocratic-delusions Those old French anatomical drawings are an endless source of delight to me. Take one cross-sectioned noggin, mix in an old PC mainboard, and a vector art illo of a virtuous cycle with some of Cryteria’s HAL9000 eyes and you’ve got a great illustration of Google’s brain-worms. https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/14/googles-ai-hype-circle/ Ireland’s privacy regulator is but a plaything in Big Tech’s hand, but it’s goddamned hard to find an open-access Garda car. I manually dressed some public domain car art in Garda livery, painstakingly tracing it over the panels. The (public domain) baby’s knit cap really hides the seams from replacing the baby’s head with HAL9000’s eye. https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/15/finnegans-snooze/#dirty-old-town Naked-guy-in-a-barrel bankruptcy images feel like something you can find in an old Collier’s or Punch, but I came up snake-eyes and ended up frankensteining a naked body into a barrel for the George Washington crest on the Washington State flag. It came out well, but harvesting the body parts from old muscle-beach photos left George with some really big guns. I tried five different pairs of suspenders here before just drawing in black polyhedrons with little grey dots for rivets. https://pluralistic.net/2023/06/03/when-the-tide-goes-out/#passive-income Illustrating Amazon’s dominance over the EU coulda been easy – just stick Amazon ‘A’s in place of the yellow stars that form a ring on the EU flag. So I decided to riff on Plutarch’s Alexander, out of lands to conquer. Rama’s statue legs were nice and high-rez. I had my choice of public domain ruin images, though it was harder thank expected to find a good Amazon box as a plinth for those broken-off legs. https://pluralistic.net/2023/06/14/flywheel-shyster-and-flywheel/#unfulfilled-by-amazon God help me, I could not stop playing with this image of a demon-haunted IoT car. All those reflections! The knife sticking out of the steering wheel, the multiple Munsch ’Scream’ers, etc etc. The more I patchked with it, the better it got, though. This one’s a banger. https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/24/rent-to-pwn/#kitt-is-a-demon To depict a “data-driven dictatorship,” I ganked elements of heavily beribboned Russian military dress uniforms, replacing the head with HAL9000’s eye. I turned the foreground into the crowds from the Nuremberg rallies and filled the sky with Matrix code waterfall. https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/26/dictators-dilemma/#garbage-in-garbage-out-garbage-back-in The best thing about analogizing DRM to demonic possession is the wealth of medieval artwork to choose from . This one comes from the 11th century ’Compendium rarissimum totius Artis Magicae sistematisatae per celeberrimos Artis hujus Magistros.’ I mixed in the shiny red Tesla (working those reflections!), and a Tesla charger to make my point. https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/28/edison-not-tesla/#demon-haunted-world Yet more dividends from those old French anatomical plates: a flayed skull, a detached jaw, a quack electronic gadget, a Wachowski code waterfall and some HAL 9000 eyes and you’ve got a truly unsettling image of machine-compelled speech. https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/02/self-incrimination/#wei-bai-bai I had no idea this would work out so well, but daaaamn, crossfading between a Wachowski code waterfall and a motherboard behind a roiling thundercloud is dank af. https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/03/there-is-no-cloud/#only-other-peoples-computers Of all the turkeys-voting-for-Christmas self-owns conservative culture warriors fall for, few can rival the “banning junk fees is woke” hustle. Slap a US-flag Punisher logo on and old-time card imprinter, add a GOP logo to a red credit-card blank, and then throw in a rustic barn countertop and you’ve got a junk-fee extracter fit for the Cracker Barrel. https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/04/owning-the-libs/#swiper-no-swiping Putting the Verizon logo on the Hinderberg was an obvious gambit (even if I did have to mess with the flames a lot), but the cutout of Paul Marcarelli as the ‘can you hear me now?’ guy, desaturated and contrast-matched, made it sing. https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/10/smartest-guys-in-the-room/#can-you-hear-me-now Note to self: Tux the Penguin is really easy to source in free/open formats! He looks great with HAL9000 eyes. https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/18/openwashing/#you-keep-using-that-word-i-do-not-think-it-means-what-you-think-it-means Rockwell’s self-portrait image is a classic; that made it a natural for a HAL9000-style remix about AI art. I put a bunch of time into chopping and remixing Rockwell’s signature to give it that AI look, and added as many fingers as would fit on each hand. https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/20/everything-made-by-an-ai-is-in-the-public-domain/ The West Midlands Police were kind enough to upload a high-rez of their surveillance camera control room to Flickr under a CC license (they’ve since deleted it), and it was the perfect frame for dozens of repeating clown images with HAL9000 red noses. This worked out great. The clown face is from a 1940s ad for novelty masks. https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/23/automation-blindness/#humans-in-the-loop I spent an absurd amount of time transforming a photo I took of three pinball machines into union-busting themed tables, pulling in a bunch of images from old Soviet propaganda art. An editorial cartoon of Teddy Roosevelt with his big stick takes center stage, while a NLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo’s official portrait presides over the scene. I hand-made the eight-segment TILT displays. https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/06/goons-ginks-and-company-finks/#if-blood-be-the-price-of-your-cursed-wealth Working with the highest-possible rez sources makes all the difference in the world. Syvwlch’s extremely high-rez paint-scraper is a gift to people writing about web-scraping, and the Matrix code waterfall mapped onto it like butter. https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/17/how-to-think-about-scraping/ This old TWA ad depicting a young man eagerly pitching an older man has incredible body-language – so much so that when I replaced their heads with raw meat, the intent and character remained intact. I often struggle for background to put behind images like this, but high-rez currency imagery, with the blown up intaglio, crushes it. https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/04/dont-let-your-meat-loaf/#meaty-beaty-big-and-bouncy I transposed Photoshop instructions for turning a face into a zombie into Gimp instructions to make Zombie Uncle Sam. The guy looking at his watch kills me. He’s from an old magazine illustration about radio broadcasting. What a face! https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/18/the-people-no/#tell-ya-what-i-want-what-i-really-really-want The mansplaining guy from the TWA ad is back, but this time he’s telling a whopper. It took so much work to give him that Pinnocchio nose. Clearly, he’s lying about capitalism, hence the Atlas Shrugged cover. Bosch’s “Garden of Earthly Delights” makes for an excellent, public domain hellscape fit for a nonconensual pitch about the miracle of capitalism. https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/27/six-sells/#youre-holding-it-wrong There’s no better image for stories about techbros scamming rubes than Bosch’s ‘The Conjurer.’ Throw in Jeff Bezos’s head and an Amazon logo and you’re off to the races. I boobytrapped this image by adding as many fingers as I could fit onto each of these figures in the hopes that someone could falsely accuse me of AI-generating this. No one did. https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/06/attention-rents/#consumer-welfare-queens Once again, it’s Bosch to the rescue. Slap a different smiley-face emoji on each of the tormented figures in ‘Garden of Earthly Delights’ and you’ve got a perfect metaphor for the ‘brand safety’ problem of hard news dying online because brands don’t want to be associated with unpleasant things, and the news is very unpleasant indeed. https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/11/ad-jacency/#brand-safety I really struggle to come up with images for my linkdump posts. I’m running out of ways to illustrate assortments and varieties. I got to noodling with a Kellogg’s mini-cereal variety pack and I realized it was the perfect place for a vicious gorilla image I’d just found online in a WWI propaganda poster headed ‘Destroy This Mad Brute.’ I put so many fake AI tells in this one – extra pupils, extra fingers, a super-AI-esque Kellogg’s logo. https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/05/variegated/#nein Bloodletting is the perfect metaphor for using rate-hikes to fight inflation. A vintage image of the Treasury, spattered with blood, makes a great backdrop. For the foreground, a medieval woodcut of bloodletting quacks – give one the head of Larry Summers, the other, Jerome Powell. For the patient, use Uncle Sam’s head. https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/20/bloodletting/#inflated-ego I killed a long videoconference call slicing up an old pulp cover showing a killer robot zapping a couple of shrunken people in bell-jars. It was the ideal image to illustrate Big Tech’s enshittification, especially when it was decorated with some classic tech slogans. https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/22/who-wins-the-argument/#corporations-are-people-my-friend There’s something meditative about manually cutting out Tenniel engravings from Alice – the Jabberwock was insane. But it was worth it for this Tron-inflected illustration using a distorted Cartesian grid to display the enormous difference between e/acc and AI doomers, and everyone else in the world. https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/27/10-types-of-people/#taking-up-a-lot-of-space Multilayer source images for your remixing pleasure: Scientist in chemlab</p>

<li>U.S. may hike tariffs on Chinese EVs</li>
</ol>
</h3>
<p style>
The Biden administration is reportedly considering raising tariffs on electric vehicles made in China, which tend to run cheaper than those made in the U.S. The move would be an attempt to “bolster the U.S. clean energy industry,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=5754c71f95&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explains</a> <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>. Chinese EVs are already subject to a 25% tariff. While an increase wouldn’t mean much in the immediate term for most Americans, it would put added strain on relations with China, which are already tense. Global markets are facing a glut of cheap Chinese clean-energy products, and the administration is reportedly also considering higher levies on solar products and EV battery packs, the <em>Journal</em> reports.

<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: Nieman Journalism Lab</p>
<p>Headlines have never been more important. In a news infoscape riddled with affective polarization, headlines help focus public opinion and offer much needed balance. Yet they exist in a system that slowly strips them of substance and renders them irrelevant. Jean Cocteau had famously quipped that “style is a simple way of saying complicated things.”…</p>

Sharks have been around for millions of years, but their population has dropped by 70% in the past 50 years. That’s mostly been driven by the value of their fins, which are considered a delicacy and status symbol in parts of Asia. Today, we’ll hear how demand for the fins has driven a network of illicit trafficking. Plus, new cars see big gains in fuel efficiency.

<h2 id="poinsettias-origins-namesakes-checkered-history-get-new-attention">Poinsettia’s Origins, Namesake’s Checkered History Get New Attention</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SANTA FE, N.M. — Like Christmas trees, Santa and reindeer, the poinsettia has long been a ubiquitous symbol of the holiday season in the U.S. and across Europe.</p>
<p>But now, nearly 200 years after the plant with the bright crimson leaves was introduced in the U.S., attention is once again turning to the poinsettia’s origins and the checkered history of its namesake, a slaveowner and lawmaker who played a part in the forced removal of Native Americans from their land. Some people would now rather call the plant by the name of its Indigenous origin in southern Mexico.</p>
<p>Some things to know:</p>
<p>Where did the name poinsettia come from?</p>
<p>The name comes from the amateur botanist and statesman Joel Roberts Poinsett, who happened upon the plant in 1828 during his tenure as the first U.S. minister to the newly independent Mexico.</p>
<p>Poinsett, who was interested in science as well as potential cash crops, sent clippings of the plant to his home in South Carolina and to a botanist in Philadelphia, who affixed the eponymous name to the plant in gratitude.</p>
<p>A life-size bronze statue of Poinsett still stands in his honor in downtown Greenville, South Carolina.</p>
<p>However, he was cast out of Mexico within a year of his discovery, having earned a local reputation for intrusive political maneuvering that extended to a network of secretive masonic lodges and schemes to contain British influence.</p>
<p>Is the ‘poinsettia’ name losing its luster?</p>
<p>As more people learn of its namesake’s complicated history, the name “poinsettia” has become less attractive in the United States.</p>
<p>Unvarnished published accounts reveal Poinsett as a disruptive advocate for business interests abroad, a slaveowner on a rice plantation in the U.S., and a secretary of war who helped oversee the forced removal of Native Americans, including the westward relocation of Cherokee populations to Oklahoma known as the “Trail of Tears.”</p>
<p>In a new biography titled Flowers, Guns and Money, historian Lindsay Schakenbach Regele describes the cosmopolitan Poinsett as a political and economic pragmatist who conspired with a Chilean independence leader and colluded with British bankers in Mexico. Though he was a slaveowner, he opposed secession, and he didn’t live to see the Civil War.</p>
<p>Schakenbach Regele renders tough judgment on Poinsett’s treatment of and regard for Indigenous peoples.</p>
<p>“Because Poinsett belonged to learned societies, contributed to botanists’ collections, and purchased art from Europe, he could more readily justify the expulsion of Natives from their homes,” she writes.</p>
<p>A Christmas flower of many names</p>
<p>The cultivation of the plant dates back to the Aztec empire in Mexico 500 years ago.</p>
<p>Among Nahuatl-speaking communities of Mexico, the plant is known as the cuetlaxochitl (kwet-la-SHO-sheet), meaning “flower that withers.” It’s an apt description of the thin red leaves on wild varieties of the plant that grow to heights above 3 meters.</p>
<p>Year-end holiday markets in Latin America brim with the potted plant known in Spanish as the “flor de Nochebuena,” or “flower of Christmas Eve,” which is entwined with celebrations of the night before Christmas. The “Nochebuena” name is traced to early Franciscan friars who arrived from Spain in the 16th century. Spaniards once called it “scarlet cloth.”</p>
<p>Additional nicknames abound: “Santa Catarina” in Mexico, “estrella federal,” or “federal star” in Argentina and “penacho de Incan,” or “headdress” in Peru.</p>
<p>Ascribed in the 19th century, the Latin name, Euphorbia pulcherrima, means “the most beautiful” of a diverse genus with a milky sap of latex.</p>
<p>So what is its preferred name?</p>
<p>“Cuetaxochitl” is winning over some enthusiasts among Mexican youths, including the diaspora in the U.S., according to Elena Jackson Albarrán, a professor of Mexican history and global and intercultural studies at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen a trend towards people openly saying: ‘Don’t call this flower either poinsettia or Nochebuena. It’s cuetlaxochitl,’” said Jackson Albarrán. “There’s going to be a big cohort of people who are like, ‘Who cares?’”</p>
<p>Most ordinary people in Mexico never say “poinsettia” and don’t talk about Poinsett, according to Laura Trejo, a Mexican biologist who is leading studies on the genetic history of the U.S. poinsettia.</p>
<p>“I feel like it’s only the historians, the diplomats and, well, the politicians who know the history of Poinsett,” Trejo said.</p>
<p>The Mexican roots of U.S. poinsettias</p>
<p>Mexican biologists in recent years have traced the genetic stock of U.S. poinsettia plants to a wild variant in the Pacific coastal state of Guerrero, verifying lore about Poinsett’s pivotal encounter there. The scientists also are researching a rich, untapped diversity of other wild variants, in efforts that may help guard against the poaching of plants and theft of genetic information.</p>
<p>The flower still grows wild along Mexico’s Pacific Coast and parts of Central America as far as Costa Rica.</p>
<p>Trejo, of the National Council of Science and Technology in the central state of Tlaxcala, said some informal outdoor markets still sell the “sun cuetlaxochitl” that resemble wild varieties, alongside modern patented varieties.</p>
<p>In her field research travels, Trejo has found households that preserve ancient traditions associated with the flower.</p>
<p>“It’s clear to us that this plant, since the pre-Hispanic era, is a ceremonial plant, an offering, because it’s still in our culture, in the interior of the county, to cut the flowers and take them to the altars,” she said in Spanish. “And this is primarily associated with the maternal goddesses: with Coatlicue, Tonantzin and now with the Virgin Mary.”</p>
<p>A lasting figure in history</p>
<p>Regardless of his troubled history, Poinsett’s legacy as an explorer and collector continues to loom large: Some 1,800 meticulously tended poinsettias are delivered in November and December from greenhouses in Maryland to a long list of museums in Washington, D.C., affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution.</p>
<p>A “pink-champagne” cultivar adorns the National Portrait Gallery this year.</p>
<p>Poinsett’s name may also live on for his connection to other areas of U.S. culture. He advocated for the establishment of a national science museum, and in part due to his efforts, a fortune bequeathed by British scientist James Smithson was used to underwrite the creation of the Smithsonian Institution.</p>

<h2 id="international-astronaut-will-be-invited-on-future-nasa-moon-landing">International Astronaut Will Be Invited on Future NASA Moon Landing</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — An international astronaut will join U.S. astronauts on the moon by decade’s end under an agreement announced Wednesday by NASA and the White House.</p>
<p>The news came as Vice President Kamala Harris convened a meeting in Washington of the National Space Council, the third such gathering under the Biden administration.</p>
<p>There was no mention of who the international moonwalker might be or even what country would be represented. A NASA spokeswoman later said that crews would be assigned closer to the lunar-landing missions, and that no commitments had yet been made to another country.</p>
<p>NASA has included international astronauts on trips to space for decades. Canadian Jeremy Hansen will fly around the moon a year or so from now with three U.S. astronauts.</p>
<p>Another crew would actually land; it would be the first lunar touchdown by astronauts in more than a half-century. That’s not likely to occur before 2027, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.</p>
<p>All 12 moonwalkers during NASA’s Apollo program of the 1960s and 1970s were U.S. citizens. The space agency’s new moon exploration program is named Artemis after Apollo’s mythological twin sister.</p>
<p>Including international partners “is not only sincerely appreciated, but it is urgently needed in the world today,” Hansen told the council.</p>
<p>NASA has long stressed the need for global cooperation in space, establishing the Artemis Accords along with the U.S. State Department in 2020 to promote responsible behavior not just at the moon but everywhere in space.</p>
<p>Representatives from all 33 countries that have signed the accords so far were expected at the space council’s meeting in Washington.</p>
<p>“We know from experience that collaboration on space delivers,” said Secretary of State Antony Blinken, citing the Webb Space Telescope, a U.S., European and Canadian effort.</p>
<p>Notably missing from the Artemis Accords: Russia and China, the only countries besides the U.S. to launch their own citizens into orbit.</p>
<p>Russia is a partner with NASA in the International Space Station, along with Europe, Japan and Canada.</p>
<p>Even earlier in the 1990s, the Russian and U.S. space agencies teamed up during the shuttle program to launch each other’s astronauts to Russia’s former orbiting Mir station.</p>
<p>During Wednesday’s meeting, Harris also announced new policies to ensure the safe use of space as more and more private companies and countries aim skyward.</p>
<p>Among the issues that the U.S. is looking to resolve: the climate crisis and the growing amount of space junk around Earth.</p>
<p>A 2021 anti-satellite missile test by Russia added more than 1,500 pieces of potentially dangerous orbiting debris, and Blinken joined others at the meeting in calling for all nations to end such destructive testing.</p>

<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: Jirka’s blog</p>
<p>The PILOT Pentopia Chameleon stylus for Palm III and VI {sup}1{/sup} arrived today. It is a stylus with integrated reset pin and - last but not least - an actual pen. The pen refill is thin and it is labelled “Pilot” but I assume that a thin (non-pressurized) Fischer refill will fit here. This stylus has a bit different shape than the original Palm III pen and its tip is a bit harder but it is usable (I am writing this post with it). It is also little thicker than the original which is actually a plus - it sits more reliable in stylus housing of my heavily used Palms - I lost several styli from my old IIIxe and almost lost one of my TRGpro recently. The {sup}1{/sup} says that it is better for writing than the original stylus but I don’t think so. I see no improvement.</p>

<p>The title is all wrong because I extensively used the TRG Pro in the past. But the last time when I synced the TRG was in 2/2016 and then I have been using the original Palm III devices (IIIx + IIIxe) instead of the TRG. I have not wanted to damage or lost my only TRG Pro (which is pretty rare as you may know). Now I have two TRGs so I can use one of them on daily basis, I think.</p>

<h2 id="solstice-gatherings-memorialize-homeless-people-who-died-on-us-streets">Solstice Gatherings Memorialize Homeless People Who Died on US Streets</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Phoenix — With his gap-tooth smile, hip-hop routines and volunteer work for a food charity, Roosevelt White III was well-known in the downtown Phoenix tent city known as The Zone.</p>
<p>But like many homeless people, White suffered from diabetes and cardiovascular disease. He died unexpectedly one sweltering September day at age 36.</p>
<p>Thousands of people like White who died this year without a permanent home are being memorialized on Thursday in communities from Cape Cod, Massachusetts, to La Crosse, Wisconsin, to Riverside, California.</p>
<p>Established in 1990, the increasingly popular Homeless Persons’ Memorial Day is observed with prayers, candles, moments of silence and the reading of names on Dec. 21, the first day of winter and the longest night of the year.</p>
<p>A national gathering called “One Life, Too Many. Another Year, Too Long” is planned for Thursday afternoon in Washington, with a Zoom call so people can follow from afar.</p>
<p>Other gatherings will be in Cincinnati, Ohio; Wilmington, Delaware; and San Diego. A ceremony in Phoenix will honor 758 homeless people confirmed to have died so far this year in Maricopa County, the most populous in Arizona and home to Phoenix, the state’s largest city.</p>
<p>That’s already a record. The Maricopa County Medical Examiner investigated 732 deaths of homeless people in 2022, representing a 42% jump in deaths from 2021.</p>
<p>“Without sufficient housing and services, people will continue to die on the streets,” said Lisa Glow, CEO at Central Arizona Shelter Services, which operates the state’s largest emergency shelter, a 600-bed facility in Phoenix.</p>
<p>DeBorah Gilbert White, the public education director for the National Coalition for the Homeless, said learning about those who died can shatter stereotypes. At one event several years ago, she learned of a 3-year-old homeless girl who died in the nation’s capital.</p>
<p>White said that as the population grows older, more people are dying in their 60s. She noted that many with chronic conditions like diabetes don’t have the necessary conditions, such as refrigeration for insulin, to care for their health.</p>
<p>Overall, homelessness is surging. The recent Annual Homeless Assessment Report from the Department of Housing and Urban Development showed that roughly 653,100 people in the United States were experiencing homelessness. That’s a 12% overall increase over the previous year and the highest since reporting began in 2007.</p>
<p>“A lot of people living in encampments are uninsured and without access to medical treatment for a variety of illnesses that are exacerbated by living unsheltered,” said Etel Haxhiaj, a spokesperson for the National Healthcare for the Homeless Council.</p>
<p>The council supports remembrance events to push for better tracking of the deaths.</p>
<p>Maricopa County is among the few U.S. jurisdictions engaged in such tracking.</p>
<p>Drug and alcohol abuse played a role in many of the deaths and was often the main cause. While a stroke killed White, methamphetamine intoxication contributed to his death, according to the medical examiner. Cardiovascular events like strokes and heart attacks, followed by traffic injuries, are also common ways that homeless people die.</p>
<p>Many homeless people are estranged from family, which means their deaths can pass virtually unnoticed. But when White died, at least 60 people, including family members from Arizona and Oklahoma, showed up for his funeral. The food was catered by Feed Phoenix, the nonprofit organization he volunteered with.</p>
<p>Among the mourners was Phoenix documentary photographer Eric Elmore, who created numerous black and white portraits of White over a year. The downtown encampment where White lived once housed hundreds of people in tents, but it has since been cleared out under a court order.</p>
<p>“He had this kind of energy that would just draw you in,” Elmore said of White. “He had a huge personality.”</p>
<p>Megan Kepler, who volunteered with White, remembered him on Wednesday as “a man who was full of kindness and joy.”</p>
<p>“Although he had many struggles, he always had a smile on his face and a positive attitude. He stayed hopeful in the face of difficulties,” Kepler said. “We miss our friend dearly, and hope that others can see that he was not just a number, but instead a valued and loved human being.”</p>

<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>So what can you do with it? Well, let’s first address the elephant in the room – the internet is still lousy on OS 9. Despite Cameron Kaiser’s genius effort put into his Classilla browser project, he’s pretty much squeezed every ounce of usability from the now 20+ year old underlying networking frameworks. A lot of websites still render “ok” in the browser, but most of the modern web will simply cause it to spit back an error. Also, file sharing with other machines on your network takes a bit more forethought these days as OS 9’s implementation of AppleTalk will only work with OS X versions up to 10.4 Tiger. In Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) and later, AppleTalk will not function at all without some difficult technical workarounds, so a “bridge” Mac is generally recommended (for those not familiar with that term – bridge Macs are machines that can handle both legacy and modern technologies and can be networked between both old and new hardware). It is also possible to wring out a bit more usability by setting up a web proxy such as macHTTP and running a small Netatalk server on one of your modern Macs (this is something I’d like to feature in the future). ↫ Adam Goff at Low End Mac Running Mac OS 9 today has become somewhat of a rite of passage for retrocomputing and operating system nerds (…2006), and every few years a new article about the experience makes the rounds. For good reason, too – OS 9 is fun, quirky, has tons of software to play around with, and still looks and feels great.</p>

<h2 id="farm-rail-companies-urge-reopening-of-us-mexico-crossings-shut-over-migrants">Farm, Rail Companies Urge Reopening of US-Mexico Crossings Shut Over Migrants</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>EAGLE PASS, Texas — Dozens of major U.S. agricultural groups on Wednesday urged the U.S. to reopen two rail crossings on the Texas-Mexico border in an effort by businesses to restore the trade routes shuttered because of increased migrant crossings. </p>
<p>In a sharply worded letter to U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, the growers - representing corn, milk, rice and soybean producers, among others - said the crossings could be easily reopened and that closures already had caused steep export losses. </p>
<p>“Each day the crossings are closed we estimate almost 1 million bushels of grain exports are potentially lost along with export potential for many other agricultural products,” the groups wrote, adding that blocking food heading to Mexico could lead to inflation or food insecurity there. </p>
<p>Railroad companies and business groups - including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce - in recent days have pressed U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to reopen the two rail bridges in Eagle Pass and El Paso after U.S. border authorities closed them on Monday in order to “redirect personnel” to process migrants crossing the border.  </p>
<p>Among the groups signing the agricultural business letter were the National Grain and Feed Association, U.S. Wheat Associates, American Soybean Association and National Corn Growers Association.</p>
<p>The U.S. Border Patrol apprehended about 10,800 migrants at the southwest border on Monday, according to an internal agency report reviewed by Reuters, a tally several current and former officials said was near or at a single-day record high.  </p>
<p>The news came after Mexico’s immigration agency said in an internal December 1 memo reviewed by Reuters that it would suspend migrant removals because of an end-of-year funding crunch.  </p>
<p>Operations should return to normal in January, a Mexican source familiar with the matter said, adding that the U.S. closure of legal border crossings appeared to be an attempt by the U.S. to pressure Mexico over the scaled-back enforcement. </p>
<p>Mexico’s foreign ministry spokesperson said no date had been set for resuming the repatriations. </p>
<p>The agricultural groups said CBP could reopen the railroad bridges with as few as five employees per crossing, challenging the agency’s rationale for closing the trade routes. </p>
<p>Acting CBP Commissioner Troy Miller said on Tuesday that illegal crossings were “presenting a serious challenge” and that CBP was using all available resources to keep agents and migrants safe. </p>
<p>CBP did not immediately respond to a request for comment related to the agricultural groups’ demands, which echoed concerns from Mexico’s top farm lobby. </p>
<p>Billions in monthly trade</p>
<p>In October, total rail freight between the El Paso and Eagle Pass ports topped $3 billion in both directions, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. That accounted for 4% of total trade across the U.S.-Mexico border that month. </p>
<p>Neil Bradley, chief policy officer of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement to Reuters that the rail shutdowns “will inflict significant economic harm” and “do nothing to secure the border.”  </p>
<p>The increase in migrant crossings comes as Democratic President Joe Biden, who is running for re-election in 2024, has sought to strike a deal with Republican lawmakers that would pair increased U.S. border security with military aid for Ukraine and Israel.  </p>
<p>But a bipartisan group of senators negotiating a compromise have so far failed to reach a deal as a Christmas break approaches. </p>
<p>Eagle Pass and El Paso have received thousands of newcomers in recent days, as migrants - including many families with young children - make their way to the border by bus, atop cargo trains, on foot and even by bicycle. </p>
<p>On Wednesday in Eagle Pass, hundreds of migrants were being held in an outdoor area near the Rio Grande. Three migrants were carried out with medical emergencies in the afternoon while others called out for food, a Reuters witness said.  </p>
<p>CBP said it was aware of two medical emergencies, one related to dehydration and another that appeared to be seizure-related. </p>
<p>During a press conference near the border, U.S. Representative Tony Gonzales, a Republican who represents Eagle Pass, urged U.S. lawmakers to make legal changes to deter illegal border crossings that have disrupted trade and transit. </p>
<p>“This has to come to an end,” Gonzales said. “We need to have open trade and commerce again.” </p>
<p>Some 270 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have been pulled from their jobs handling deportations and international investigations to help with migrant transport and other tasks at the border, a Department of Homeland Security official told Reuters, requesting anonymity to discuss internal operations.  </p>
<p>Union Pacific and Berkshire Hathaway’s BNSF Railway, two of the nation’s largest freight railroad companies, warned of supply chain disruptions ahead of the Christmas holiday because of the railway bridge closures. </p>
<p>Union Pacific said in a statement on its website that a range of products - including grain, beer, metals, cement and automotive parts - have been halted because of the closures. The closed bridges account for about 45% of its cross-border shipments, and the overall economic impact of the closure will be more than $200 million per day, the rail company said.  </p>
<p>BNSF declined to comment on the value of goods affected by the closings. </p>
<p>In addition to the railroad crossing closures, U.S. border authorities this month have closed a busy pedestrian crossing near San Diego, California, and another crossing in remote Lukeville, Arizona, to free up workers to process arriving migrants.</p>

<h2 id="vibe-check-30">Vibe Check №30</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
The year is almost over. The weather is delightful in Austin and walking the neighborhood is a joy. Happiness arrives in holiday cards. The tree is up and the ambient stress of moonlighting as an assistant to a jolly, fat norseman takes its toll. The power grid still hums but –the question on every Texan’s mind– for how long?
</p>
<p>
There’s a lot going on behind the scenes, big life changes, but here’s some of the highlights (nay, lowlights?) from the past couple months.
</p>
<h2>
My wife’s back went out
</h2>
<p>
Right after my last vibe check my wife’s back went out. We’re not sure what caused it, but this was the most severe episode she’s ever experienced. One parent down had a massive impact on our quality of life. November productivity was a wash due as I scrambled to assist her, visiting doctors, and assuming a large swath of family responsibilities. She is so much better at keeping the family gears turning, I was drowning.
</p>
<p>
After some successful PT she’s doing much better and we’re almost back to where we were before November, which is welcome. And our kids pitched in and helped as best they could, I’m thankful for that.
</p>
<h2>
Covid strikes again
</h2>
<p>
The week after Thanksgiving my beautiful daughter comes into our room at night and is restless. In a moment of uncool dadsmanship I inform her that she’s snoring too loud. A steam shower fixed the issue, poor kid. A couple days later I started to feel ill… then I felt terrible… then I tested positive for Covid. Oof.
</p>
<p>
This one laid me out pretty good with that terrible incurable headache and sandbag-like sinus gunk. I spent six days sick and isolated, whisking myself away like a goddamed phantom of the opera whenever my family came home. No one else tested positive, but seems like a clear case that my daughter carried it home from school after the break and gave it to me, the immune system deprived remote worker; a blank petri dish ripe for infection.
</p>
<p>
I’m all better now, but let me say getting Covid the first week of December puts you super far behind in your Christmas shopping.
</p>
<h2>
The Great Subscription Culling
</h2>
<p>
After interviewing family members about what shows they actually watch from each service and organizing it all in a spreadsheet, I nuked about $100 worth of monthly subscriptions. Services including but not limited to…
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Streaming: Peacock, Disney/Hulu, YouTube Premium, Apple One, Dropout, Crunchyroll
</li>
<li>
Community: Some Patreons, some Discord boosts
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The hard thing is that I like these services. I find value in them… just not all at the same time. How are we going to live without them? Well there’s some strategy…
</p>
<ol>
<li>
On-demand services - If we want Service X more than Netlfix, we cancel Netflix.
</li>
<li>
Move to the ad-supported version of services (YouTube, Disney/Hulu) - Way cheaper and if we all hate the ads, we can decide as a family to remove them.
</li>
<li>
Ask for some as gifts (Dropout, Crunchyroll) - A monthly service fee for entertainment for one person in the household is excessive… but those make great gifts! It’s some bank account slight of hand, but I can enjoy my weird Gundam obsession guilt free.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
On that note, a ShopTalk listener heard wind about my plans and graciously gifted me a subscription to Crunchyroll. Incredibly thoughtful. Thank you, Melanie.
</p>
<p>
I think Subscription Culling should be a national holiday we do every equinox. If streaming services are going to raise prices every quarter, we should normalize the threat of abandoning them en masse.

<a href="https://amzn.to/48FMBof">The Big Myth</a> - A dismantling of the idea about the invisible hand of the market. Paired with other books I’ve read this year, you see how “That’s socialism!” is a propaganda dogwhistle to cover for a much bigger lie that unfettered capitalism works. Starting back in the union busting days because people were getting their arms cut off in the machines, businesses began promoting the idea that regulating business is bad. The conservative thinktank at the Chicago school of economics developed the lie by cherry-picking and bastardizing Adam Smith’s writings to suit their “greed is good” agenda. I never knew Milton Friedman was a person I could get mad at… but here we are. This lie was then carried on by GE propagandists like (former SAG union president) Ronald Reagan who popularized trickle down economics during his US presidency and continued with neoliberal bank deregulation in the Clinton administration. The too-big-to-failures of the market never fall on the corporations, it’s always on the public and the taxpayer. [/rant]

Set in the far future on a different timeline, the technologically advanced Moonrace invades the primitive Earth. A Gundam from a time long ago is found. It’s not a story about fighting robots so much as a story about people who find themselves in the middle of a war. It’s more like a Ghibli than a Gundam. I wish I had finished this but GundamInfo took the videos down. 😭

<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
As a part of having new x86_64 build instances, we updated all of the RPM signing keys to meet FIPS requirements (except RHEL7, where updated GPG keys will appear but not meet FIPS requirement) for RHEL 9, 8 and 7 (and their derivatives), and Fedora 39 &amp; 38. Existing keys are weak and throwing warnings to many users.
</p>
<p>
We will also update aarch64 and ppc64le signing keys as well.
</p>
<p>
New repo RPMs, the new keys and RPMs re-signed with the new keys will be published on 3 January 2024.
</p>
<p>
If you want to receive updates from the PostgreSQL RPM repo after 3 January 2024, you’ll need to update the repository RPM and install new keys. We will publish detailed information and howto in <a href="https://yum.postgresql.org">https://yum.postgresql.org</a> before new year.

<h2 id="effects-of-ondansetron-exposure-during-icu-stay-on-outcomes-of-critically-ill-patients-with-sepsis-a-cohort-study">Effects of ondansetron exposure during ICU stay on outcomes of critically ill patients with sepsis: a cohort study</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Sepsis is a life-threatening disease with high morbidity and mortality, characterized by an inadequate systemic immune response to an initial stimulus. Whether the use of ondansetron (OND) during intensive care unit (ICU) stay is associated with the prognosis of sepsis patients remains unclear.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
Critically ill patients with sepsis were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Multivariate logistic regression and Cox regression analyses were used to explore the association between OND use and clinical outcomes after adjusting for confounders. Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used for survival analysis. Propensity score matching (PSM) and subgroup analysis were performed to further confirm the results.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
The OND-medication group showed reduced in-hospital mortality, 28-day and 90-day mortalities. The OR for in-hospital mortality was 0.80 (0.64-0.99) and HRs for 28-day mortality and 90-day mortality were 0.77 (0.64-0.92) and 0.83 (0.70-0.98), respectively. After PSM, the clinical outcomes remained consistent. In-hospital mortality was lower in the OND-medication group (28.1% <italic>vs</italic>. 35.8%, P= 0.044), as well as 28-day mortality (23.4% <italic>vs</italic>. 32.1%, P=0.022) and 90-day mortality (27.4% <italic>vs</italic>. 35.8%, P=0.035). The protective effect of OND in sepsis patients was relatively robust, independent of age, septic shock, vasopressin and mechanical ventilation. Additionally, the OND users had longer lengths of stay in ICU (6.9(3.1-13.2) <italic>vs</italic>. 5.1(2.5-11.0), P = 0.026) while no statistical differences were found in lengths of stay in hospital (P = 0.333).
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
OND exposure might be associated with lower in-hospital, 28-day, and 90-day mortality rates in critically ill patients with sepsis. This study indicated that OND might help improve the prognosis of patients with sepsis.

<h2 id="drosophila-melanogaster-as-a-model-to-study-polymicrobial-synergy-and-dysbiosis">Drosophila melanogaster as a model to study polymicrobial synergy and dysbiosis</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<p>
The fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has emerged as a valuable model for investigating human biology, including the role of the microbiome in health and disease. Historically, studies involving the infection of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> with single microbial species have yielded critical insights into bacterial colonization and host innate immunity. However, recent evidence has underscored that multiple microbial species can interact in complex ways through physical connections, metabolic cross-feeding, or signaling exchanges, with significant implications for healthy homeostasis and the initiation, progression, and outcomes of disease. As a result, researchers have shifted their focus toward developing more robust and representative <italic>in vivo</italic> models of co-infection to probe the intricacies of polymicrobial synergy and dysbiosis. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the pioneering work and recent advances in the field, highlighting the utility of <italic>Drosophila</italic> as an alternative model for studying the multifaceted microbial interactions that occur within the oral cavity and other body sites. We will discuss the factors and mechanisms that drive microbial community dynamics, as well as their impacts on host physiology and immune responses. Furthermore, this review will delve into the emerging evidence that connects oral microbes to systemic conditions in both health and disease. As our understanding of the microbiome continues to evolve, <italic>Drosophila</italic> offers a powerful and tractable model for unraveling the complex interplay between host and microbes including oral microbes, which has far-reaching implications for human health and the development of targeted therapeutic interventions.

<h2 id="protective-role-of-n-acetylcysteine-and-sulodexide-on-endothelial-cells-exposed-on-patients-serum-after-sars-cov-2-infection">Protective role of N-acetylcysteine and Sulodexide on endothelial cells exposed on patients’ serum after SARS-CoV-2 infection</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<p>
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 causes hyperinflammation and activation of coagulation cascade and, as a result, aggravates endothelial cell dysfunction. N-acetylcysteine and Sulodexide have been found to mitigate endothelial damage. The influence on coronary artery endothelial cells of serum collected after 4 ± 1 months from coronavirus infection was studied. The concentrations of serum samples of interleukin 6, von Willebrand Factor, tissue Plasminogen Activator, and Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 were studied. The cultures with serum of patients after coronavirus infection were incubated with N-acetylcysteine and Sulodexide to estimate their potential protective role. The blood inflammatory parameters were increased in the group of cultures incubated with serum from patients after coronavirus infection. Supplementation of the serum from patients after coronavirus infection with N-acetylcysteine or Sulodexide reduced the synthesis of interleukin 6 and von Willebrand Factor. No changes in the synthesis of tissue Plasminogen Activator were observed. N-acetylcysteine reduced the synthesis of Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1. N-acetylcysteine and Sulodexide increased the tPA/PAI-1 ratio. N-acetylcysteine may have a role in reducing the myocardial injury occurring in the post-COVID-19 syndrome.

<h2 id="the-preliminary-evidence-on-the-association-of-the-gut-microbiota-with-stroke-risk-stratification-in-south-chinese-population">The preliminary evidence on the association of the gut microbiota with stroke risk stratification in South Chinese population</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Aims
</title>
<p>
This study aimed to investigate the association between the gut microbiota and the risk of stroke.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
Faecal samples from 60 participants in South China, including 45 individuals with risk factors for stroke and 15 healthy controls, were collected and subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing. A bioinformatics analysis was performed to characterise the gut microbial diversity and taxonomic compositions at different risk levels (low, moderate, and high) of stroke. Functional prediction and correlation analyses between the microbiota and laboratory markers were performed to explore the potential mechanisms.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
A significant difference in beta diversity was observed between the participants from the stroke risk and healthy control groups. Linear discriminant effect size analysis revealed a large number of vascular beneficial bacteria enriched in the participants from the healthy control and low-risk groups, but a few vascular harmful bacteria were more abundant in the participants from the high-risk group than in those from the other groups. In addition, <italic>Anaerostipes</italic>, <italic>Clostridium_XlVb</italic>, and <italic>Flavonifractor</italic>, all of which belonged to the <italic>Firmicutes</italic> phylum, were enriched in the participants from the low-risk group, and their relative abundances gradually decreased as the stroke risk increased. Spearman’s analysis revealed that these outstanding microbiota correlated with the levels of triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, white blood cells, neutrophils, and carotid intima-media thickness.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
The preliminary evidence suggests that gut microbiota is associated with stroke risk. It potentially ameliorates atherosclerosis by targeting lipid metabolism and inflammation. This provides novel insights into the early screening of stroke risk and primary prevention.

<h2 id="the-spatiotemporal-distribution-and-prognostic-factors-of-japanese-encephalitis-in-shanxi-province-china-20052022">The spatiotemporal distribution and prognostic factors of Japanese encephalitis in Shanxi Province, China, 2005–2022</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<p>
Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a naturally occurring localized disease caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus, which is spread by the Culex tritaeniorhynchus. China has a high rate of JE. Shanxi, located in North China, has a high prevalence of adult JE. Adult JE has more severe complications, mortality, and a higher disease burden, making it a public health issue. This retrospective study examined the dynamic epidemic changes, high-risk areas of JE, and clinical characteristics and prognostic factors of adult JE in Shanxi Province. The findings revealed that July to September was the primary epidemic season of JE and that JE cases were mainly in individuals over the age of 40. The incidence of JE from 2005 to 2022 demonstrated a positive spatial correlation with significant clustering characteristics, with high-incidence clusters in the south and southeast. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that higher cerebrospinal fluid pressure, higher white blood cell counts, higher neutrophil percentage, deep coma, and lower albumin were independent factors for poor prognosis of adult JE. The developed risk prediction model holds great promise in early prognosis assessment of patients, providing a basis for clinical decision-making and early clinical intervention.

<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Blood is a common sample source for metagenomics next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in clinical practice. In this study, we aimed to detect the diagnostic value of blood mNGS in a large real-world cohorts.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
Blood mNGS results of 1,046 cases were collected and analyzed along with other laboratory tests. The capabilities and accuracy of blood mNGS were compared with other conventional approaches.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Both the surgical department and the intensive care unit had a positive rate of over 80% in blood mNGS. The positive rate of mNGS was consistent with clinical manifestations. Among the 739 positive samples, 532 were detected as mixed infections. Compared to pathogen cultures, the negative predictive value of blood mNGS for bacteria and fungi detection was 98.9% [95%CI, 96.9%-100%], with an accuracy rate of 89.39%. When compared with polymer chain reaction, the consistency rates of blood mNGS for virus identification were remarkably high.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusions
</title>
<p>
Blood mNGS have significant advantages in detecting difficult-to-cultivate bacteria or fungi, viruses, and mixed infections, which benefits patients of surgery department the most. Samples other than blood are recommended for mNGS test if a specific infection is suspected. The reporting threshold and reporting criteria of blood mNGS need to be optimized.

<h2 id="intrinsic-factors-driving-mosquito-vector-competence-and-viral-evolution-a-review">Intrinsic factors driving mosquito vector competence and viral evolution: a review</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<p>
Mosquitoes are responsible for the transmission of numerous viruses of global health significance. The term “vector competence” describes the intrinsic ability of an arthropod vector to transmit an infectious agent. Prior to transmission, the mosquito itself presents a complex and hostile environment through which a virus must transit to ensure propagation and transmission to the next host. Viruses imbibed in an infectious blood meal must pass in and out of the mosquito midgut, traffic through the body cavity or hemocoel, invade the salivary glands, and be expelled with the saliva when the vector takes a subsequent blood meal. Viruses encounter physical, cellular, microbial, and immunological barriers, which are influenced by the genetic background of the mosquito vector as well as environmental conditions. Collectively, these factors place significant selective pressure on the virus that impact its evolution and transmission. Here, we provide an overview of the current state of the field in understanding the mosquito-specific factors that underpin vector competence and how each of these mechanisms may influence virus evolution.

<h2 id="us-vehicles-set-fuel-economy-record-in-2022-as-ev-sales-climb">US Vehicles Set Fuel Economy Record in 2022 as EV Sales Climb</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. new vehicles set a record high for fuel economy in 2022, with the biggest yearly improvement in nine years to an average of 11 kilometers per liter (26 miles per gallon) as electric vehicle sales jumped, but the Detroit Three automakers continued to lag rivals.</p>
<p>Vehicles were up 0.2 kp/l (0.6 mpg) over 2021 after being unchanged versus 2020, the Environmental Protection Agency said, noting electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles improved the average fuel economy by 0.5 kp/l (1.2 mpg) in 2022. Fuel economy is forecast to increase to 11.4 kp/l (26.9 mpg) in 2023, the EPA said.</p>
<p>EPA Administrator Michael Regan said the report “highlights the historic progress made so far by the industry to reduce climate pollution and other harmful emissions.”</p>
<p>The report showed Tesla sold additional emissions credits and General Motors and Mercedes-Benz purchased credits in 2022. Automakers use credits to meet requirements.</p>
<p>Stellantis had the lowest fuel economy of major automakers, followed by GM and Ford, while Tesla is the most efficient followed by Hyundai and Honda. Horsepower, vehicle weight and size all hit new records in 2022 — and are projected to hit again record levels in 2023.</p>
<p>The EPA said EVs, plug-in hybrid and fuel-cell production rose to 7% in 2022 and are projected to hit 12% in 2023. The average range of EVs rose to a new high of 490 kilometers (305 miles) — more than four times the 2011 range.</p>
<p>The report showed Americans kept moving away from cars and are buying more SUVs. Sedans and wagons fell to just 27% of vehicles sold in 2022, while SUVs rose to 54%.</p>
<p>Dave Cooke, senior vehicles analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the report showed emissions from gas-powered vehicles have barely moved since 2015.</p>
<p>“Automakers are lagging in their efforts to clean up conventional gasoline vehicles, which are still the vast majority of new vehicles sold and will be on the road for years to come,” Cooke said.</p>
<p>The EPA in April proposed sweeping emissions cuts for new vehicles through 2032, including a 56% reduction in projected fleet average emissions over 2026 requirements that it says would result in 67% of new vehicles by 2032 being electric.</p>
<p>Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Safe Climate Transport Campaign, said the EPA should finalize even tougher rules, while automakers and the United Auto Workers union want the EPA to soften its proposal set to be finalized.</p>

<h2 id="us-defense-secretary-austin-makes-unannounced-visit-to-uss-gerald-r.-ford-aircraft-carrier-defending-israel">US Defense Secretary Austin Makes Unannounced Visit to USS Gerald R. Ford Aircraft Carrier Defending Israel</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ABOARD THE USS GERALD R. FORD — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin flew out to the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier Wednesday to meet with the sailors he has ordered to remain at sea to prevent the Israel-Hamas war from spilling over into a deadlier regional conflict.</p>
<p>Austin was in the region to press Israel to shift its bombardment of Gaza to a more limited campaign and more quickly transition to address Palestinian civilians’ dire humanitarian needs.</p>
<p>At the same time, the U.S. has been concerned that Israel will launch a similar military operation along its northern border with Lebanon to expel Hezbollah militants there, potentially opening a second front and widening the war.</p>
<p>At a news conference in Tel Aviv on Monday, Austin didn’t say whether U.S. troops might be further extended to defend Israel if its campaign expands into Lebanon, and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant seemed to tone down recent rhetoric that a northern front was imminent, deferring to diplomatic efforts first.</p>
<p>Still, that leaves incredible uncertainty for the Ford and its crew, which Austin ordered to the Eastern Mediterranean to be closer to Israel the day after Hamas militants stormed into southern Israel on October 7. The aircraft carrier’s more than 4,000 sailors and the accompanying warships were supposed to be home in early November.</p>
<p>Using the public address system of the Ford, which is sailing a few hundred miles off the coast of Israel, Austin thanked the sailors and their families for giving up spending the holidays together because of the mission.</p>
<p>“Sometimes our greatest achievements are the bad things we stop from happening,” Austin told the crew. “In a moment of huge tension in the region, you all have been the linchpin of preventing a wider regional conflict.”</p>
<p>The defense secretary met with a group of sailors in the Ford’s hangar bay to talk about the various dangers in the region that the carrier, the destroyers and the cruisers deployed along with it have been watching.</p>
<p>He thanked them for keeping attention on cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, and later told reporters traveling with him that if Israel transitions away from major combat operations in Gaza, it could possibly ease some of the regional tension that has kept the Ford in place.</p>
<p>The Ford’s commanding officer, Navy Captain Rick Burgess, said one of the Ford’s main contributions has been to stay close enough to Israel that it can send its aircraft in to provide support, if needed. While the Ford’s fighter and surveillance aircraft are not contributing to the surveillance needs of Israel’s operations in Gaza, other ships in its strike group are, Burgess said.</p>
<p>The Ford is one of two U.S. carrier strike groups bracketing the conflict. The other, the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, has recently patrolled near the Gulf of Aden, at the mouth of the Red Sea waterway where so many commercial vessels have come under attack in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Iranian-backed Houthis in nearby Yemen have vowed to continue striking commercial vessels transiting the Red Sea with ballistic missiles and drones until Israel ceases its devastating bombardment of Gaza, which has now killed more than 19,000 Palestinians.</p>
<p>To counter the ship attacks, Austin announced a new international maritime mission Tuesday to get countries to send their warships and other assets to the southern Red Sea, to protect the roughly 400 commercial vessels that transit the waterway daily.</p>
<p>Since it left Norfolk in the first week of May, the Ford’s fighter aircraft and surveillance planes have conducted more than 8,000 missions. The crew, Austin noted, has been moving at full speed — consuming more than 100,000 Monster energy drinks and 155,000 Red Bulls along the way.</p>

<h2 id="integrating-android-applications-into-gnome-and-kde-on-mobile-using-sailfish-os-aliendalvik">Integrating Android applications into GNOME and KDE on mobile using Sailfish OS’ aliendalvik</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>Plasma 6 is coming together nicely on the desktop! Coming back from hiatus, I was pleasantly greeted by a much more working session than when I last saw it in May; I have now completely switched over to it on my main machine! On the other hand, there is still a lot of work to do on mobile to prepare it for the Plasma 6 release in February. I will outline the current situation and the work I have done in the past few months in order to make Plasma 6 a possibility for Plasma Mobile. ↫ Devin at espi.dev The linked blog post provides a great overview of the work that is being done and needs to be done on Plasma Mobile for Plasma 6, and I have to say that it’s definitely looking good and I’m quite interested is somehow giving Plasma Mobile a go. The problem, however, is one that’s all too familiar to anyone who’s tried to run anything but Android or iOS as their main mobile operating system over the past 15 years or so: the lack of the kind of applications that you need to be a part of modern society. I don’t like it, but without my banking applications, identity applications I need in Sweden, things like WhatsApp, Signal, Discord – my phone would basically be a curious toy instead of a useful tool. Add needing the best possible smartphone camera to the equation – I have two small kids – and using anything but iOS and Android is simply out of the question. One alternative smartphone operating system knew this, and implemented fairly transparent Android application compatibility – Sailfish – through their Aliendalvik tool. It seems Jonas Dreßler, who works on GNOME Shell for mobile, was curious, and decided to take a closer look at Aliendalvik, to see if there’s anything there that the teams working on bringing KDE and GNOME to smartphones can make something of it. Sadly, Aliendalvik is not open source, so some reverse-engineering was required. The interesting thing here is that due to the fairly standard userspace Sailfish is using, the Android integration is mostly using standard freedesktop APIs to integrate with the host OS: Running Android apps are exposed as individual Wayland surfaces/windows, notifications from Android appear as org.freedesktop.Notification messages on DBus, music player controls are exposed using MPRIS, and even text input for android apps can be provided using the Wayland text input protocol. This means that basically Aliendalvik should work just as well on a standard Linux distribution like Fedora, Arch Linux, or Debian. The Android container can be started using standard linux container tooling and the host integration binaries are compiled for ARM64 and mostly link to various open source Qt libraries. ↫ Jonas Dreßler After a few days of reverse-engineering, hacking, and lots of other hard work, Dreßler managed to get Aliendalvik to work on GNOME Shell running on Arch on a smartphone, with all the integration between the Android applicatins and the underlying Arch installation working, and the code and instructions are up on Github. He also posted a video showing it working, and it’s indeed as impressive as it sounds. Sadly, the elephant in the room here is, of course, the fact that Aliendalvik is not open source. Jolla could potentially offer it for purchase on non-Sailfish Linux-based smartphones, or perhaps even release it as open source entirely, but I’m not entirely sure if Jolla would be interested in any of that. The company is… In a bit of an odd state, and I feel like it’s mostly been in limbo with not as much progress as they once hoped they’d make. Releasing one of their crown jewels as open source seems unlikely. My personal conviction is that if we ever want a Linux smartphone that is somewhat viable but isn’t Android, it’s going to have to be either Plasma Mobile or GNOME Shell on mobile, running on one of the popular, mainstream distributions that already run on ARM, are interested in mobile, and have a huge community to power the whole thing. Things like Sailfish or even Ubuntu Touch, as interesting and impressive as they are, just don’t seem viable to me in the long term when the entirety of the KDE and GNOME communities are working on their own projects.</p>

<h2 id="heres-how-android-app-sideloading-third-party-billing-will-change-following-settlement">Here’s how Android app sideloading &amp; third-party billing will change following settlement</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>One of the changes Google is forced to make because of the antitrust trial vs. Epic concerns how sideloading works on Android. Right now, sideloading an app on Android requires users to open an APK and, if the source app is not already approved, follow a link to settings where that option can be enabled before they can return to the installation process. Following the changes outlined in this settlement, Android will be required to simplify this process by condensing it down to one screen. Android will still be able to outline the risks of sideloading on this screen, but it will be a one-step process. The new screen will say: ↫ Ben Schoon at 9to5Google I’m not sure if this is a better approach. The way I have sideloading set up on my Android devices is that only File, Google’s file manager for Android, is allowed to install any APK, so even if, for some reason, I download a harmful APK accidentally through a phishing email or my browser, it will just sit inert in my downloads folder until I were to actively open Files and install said APK. It’s safeguard I most likely don’t need, but I do like having installing APKs limited to just the Google file manager for my own peace of mind. This change would, if I’m reading things correctly, make it so that any application can more easily be given the permission to install APKs, which seems like it’s not going to encourage many more people to intentionally sideload, but will perhaps make people accidentally grant random applications the permission to do so. It’s an odd change, for sure, and I hope there’s some way to disable this if Google implements this outside of the US as well.</p>

<h2 id="poll-the-americans-who-worry-least-about-climate-change">Poll: The Americans Who Worry Least About Climate Change</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-20, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDg3ODY5My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MDk1MDk1OH0.8iWTuBGw6vIGYPwE3uM97VL4N89QfIwuHlBV-3yQir0/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
When Canadian <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/smoke-forecast-chicago-detroit-ohio-ny" target="_blank">wildfire smoke</a> descended on my hometown in Indiana this summer, I was distraught. I live in London now, but much of my family remains in the Midwest, and as an orange haze blanketed the landscape and the air quality plummeted, I worried about their health. “Smoke everywhere!” my dad texted, alongside a photo of the fields near my childhood home, shrouded in smog. “Guess I better stay inside when I get home.”
</p>
<p>
The effects of climate change will vary from region to region, but everyone’s life will be affected in some way, eventually. Even though I know this to be true, I had selfishly and naively hoped that the Midwest would be insulated from the worst of it. I fretted about my friends on the East Coast and my mom in California. But for my relatives in the middle of the country, I was never that worried.
</p>
<p>
And it seems I’m not alone. A recent <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/americans-overwhelmingly-want-u-s-to-do-more-on-climate-change-heatmap-poll-finds" target="_blank">Heatmap News poll</a> found that, compared to people in the South, Northeast, and West, Midwesterners were consistently blasé about climate change. The poll tried presenting this question in different ways:<em> Do you worry about what climate change means for you personally? Do you worry that extreme weather events will happen in your area more frequently? Do you worry about what climate change means for your kids? </em>Over and over, Midwesterners registered the lowest level of alarm.
</p>
<p>
On the topics of wildfires, drought, flooding, and extreme heat, the Midwest has the highest share of respondents who say they are not concerned. Fifty-two percent of Midwesterners say climate change poses little or no risk to their region — no other region comes anywhere near that level of confidence in their own safety. In fact, all other parts of the country think the Midwest is at greater risk from a planet on fire than Midwesterners themselves do.

</iframe>
</center>
<p>
It would be easy to dismiss this phenomenon as politically fueled, but that would be too simple. It’s true that Pew <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/religious-landscape-study/region/midwest/political-ideology/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">surveys show</a> the majority of voters in the Midwest lean conservative, and there’s no doubt Republicans are historically <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/08/09/what-the-data-says-about-americans-views-of-climate-change/#:~:text=Our%20previous%20surveys%20show%20that,significantly%20by%20age%20and%20ideology." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">less likely</a> to believe that climate change is a serious problem. But in Heatmap’s polling, at least, respondents in the Midwest largely identified as moderates and independents. Plus, the poll doesn’t show that Midwesterners doubt climate change is real. They just don’t think it affects them all that much.
</p>
<p>
And in some respects, they’re right. By virtue of its location, separated by hundreds or thousands of miles from the flood-prone coasts and the fire-prone regions to the south and west, the Midwest has so far been spared some of the scariest, most extreme weather events of recent years. No hurricanes decimating neighborhoods. No major wildfires scorching the landscape.

<p>
“We up to now haven’t suffered the loss and damage a lot of coastal or mountain areas have,” said <a href="https://science.iupui.edu/people-directory/people/filippelli-gabriel.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dr. Gabriel Filippelli</a>, professor of Earth sciences at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis and executive director of the Indiana University Environmental Resilience Institute. But climate change <em>is</em> happening here. It’s just happening more slowly.
</p>
<p>
Take flooding, for instance. While warming oceans and sea level rise are imminent threats to America’s coasts, climate change is gradually making extreme precipitation more likely in the Midwest. “Our 100-year floods are no longer 100-year floods,” said Filippelli. “Now they happen every 10 to 15 years.” Last year heavy rain brought devastating deluges to states including Illinois and Missouri; 2019 was the Midwest’s <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/MW-2019_Final.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wettest calendar year</a> since 1895, causing at least <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/environment/ct-climate-disasters-cost-midwest-20200115-jubchhqe7bfdnolpw3z7cwjwvm-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$6.2 billion</a> in damage.

<iframe aria-label="Grouped Columns" data-external="1" frameborder="0" height="400" id="datawrapper-chart-y2ua1" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/y2ua1/1/" style="border: none;" title="I worry about what climate change means for me personally" width="680">
</iframe>
</center>
<p>
Dangerous heat and “flash droughts,” extremely dry periods that come on quickly and with little warning, are also creeping risks. <a href="https://firststreet.org/press/press-release-2022-heat-model-launch/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Research</a> from the nonprofit First Street Foundation shows the Midwest is part of a growing “extreme heat belt” that will, over the next 30 years, experience more days when the heat index – what the temperature feels like to the human body, factoring in humidity – hits 125 degrees Fahrenheit. Heat like that can kill not only humans, but also farm animals and crops. The Natural Resources Defense Council <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/midwest-heat-waves-may-cook-crops-and-fry-harvests" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">says</a> extreme heat and drought could wilt crops across “America’s Breadbasket,” “potentially causing ripples to food supplies across the world.”
</p>
<p>
Why aren’t Midwestern farmers sounding the alarm, then? Because many “believe that this is a cycle that we’re going to get through,” said <a href="https://www.climatebreakthrough.org/awardee/jane-kleeb/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jane Kleeb</a>, chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party and 2023 recipient of the Climate Breakthrough Award for her work in blocking the Keystone XL oil pipeline. “They’ve been through difficult times, whether it’s the Dust Bowl or the Depression or World Wars, and those generational lines are still threaded through families,” Kleeb said. “There’s a huge value in hard work in rural communities, and in the idea that as a community, we’re going to get through it together. I think that’s how they view climate change.”
</p>
<center>
<iframe aria-label="Grouped Columns" data-external="1" frameborder="0" height="400" id="datawrapper-chart-6V1Ux" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/6V1Ux/1/" style="border: none;" title="How at risk do you think the Midwest is from climate change?" width="680">
</iframe>
</center>
<p>
In other words, Midwestern farming families are used to doing the Very American Thing of pulling themselves up by their bootstraps and getting on with it. The federal government’s Crop Insurance program makes it easier to keep on believing in the power of pure gumption — the government pays if crops fail due to “ <a href="https://www.benefits.gov/benefit/386" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">natural causes</a>,” which means that rarely do farmers feel the full effect of climate change on their pocketbooks.
</p>
<p>
There are plenty of other effects of climate change the federal government won’t help with — a rise in tick- and mosquito-borne illnesses, for one. The federal government’s most recent <a href="https://nca2023.globalchange.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Climate Assessment</a> projects that the Ohio Valley could see more than 200 cases of West Nile virus every year by 2050. Lyme disease is already endemic to the region.
</p>
<p>
There’s also the secondary risk of an influx of climate migrants seeking safety, which will affect not just rural and industrial communities but also population centers like Minneapolis and Kansas City. “It’s anecdotal at best,” said Filippelli, “but we have evidence there are people leaving the coasts because of fire danger as well as the water issues.” These people may come not just from the U.S., but also <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Report-on-the-Impact-of-Climate-Change-on-Migration.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">around the world</a>.
</p>
<p>
And then there’s that wildfire smoke. The <a href="https://nca2023.globalchange.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Climate Assessment</a> predicts that drifting haze will become a regular nuisance in the Midwest. Hoosiers were annoyed by the smoke this year, Filippelli said, but “they didn’t always link it to climate change.” That comes across in the polling: Sixty-three percent of Midwestern respondents said — in November of this year, a few months after their summer of smoke — that their areas have not been affected by climate change.
</p>
<p>
To Kleeb, bridging this disconnect is the project. Messaging matters, and climate advocates and policymakers would do well to know their audience. Extolling veganism or focusing on the environmental hazards of methane produced by cow burps probably isn’t going to land well with farmers and ranchers.
</p>
<p>
“Rural folks get very defensive because you’re essentially blaming their grandpa, their father, their husband or wife who is currently farming and, from their perspective, providing food not only for America, but for the world — and you’re saying they’re bad,” Kleeb said. “When people say they don’t believe in climate change, it’s because they feel they’re being blamed for something they’re not responsible for.”
</p>
<p>
Instead, Kleeb wants to see more emphasis put on how rural Midwesterners can be part of the solutions, from introducing regenerative farming to providing the land needed to build out renewable energy infrastructure. “If anything, they know the land,” Kleeb says. “They know every hill, every blade of grass. They know where it floods when they get heavy rains. So really acknowledging that local knowledge in asking them to be partners at the table is absolutely critical.”
</p>
<p>
One thing many don’t appreciate about the Midwest is how much sky there is — any weather that’s on its way you can see from miles out. The smoke hovered over my hometown for a few days. During that time, I hardly slept. I kept checking the weather obsessively, hoping for some sign of relief. I even sent my dad links to articles about how to build your own air purifier. Finally, on the third day, he texted me an update: A strong weather front was approaching Indiana from the west, expected to sweep away the wildfire smoke as it passed over the state.
</p>
<p>
“Rain!” the text read. “Beautiful rain!”

<h2 id="pluralistic-2024s-public-domain-is-a-banger-20-dec-2023">Pluralistic: 2024’s public domain is a banger (20 Dec 2023)</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-20, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links 2024’s public domain is a banger: How he got in my pajamas, I don’t know. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2013, 2018, 2022 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading 2024’s public domain is a banger (permalink) They stole something from you. For decades, they stole it. That thing they stole? Your entire culture. For all of human history, works created in living memory entered the public domain every year. 40 years ago, that stopped. First in 1976, and then again in 1998, Congress retroactively extended copyright’s duration by 20 years, for all works, including works whose authors were unknown and long dead, whose proper successors could not be located. Many of these authors were permanently erased from history as every known copy of their works disappeared before they could be brought back into our culture through reproduction, adaptation and re-use (copyright is “strict liability,” meaning that even if you pay to clear the rights to a work from someone who has good reason to believe they control those rights, if they’re wrong, you are on the hook as an infringer, and the statutory damages run to six figures). Works that are still in our cultural currents 50 or 70 or 90 years after their creation are an infinitesimal fraction of all the works we create as a species. But these works are – by definition – extraordinarily important to our culture. The creators who made these works were able to plunder a rich public domain of still-current works as inputs to their own enduring creations. The slow-motion arson attack on the public domain meant that two generations of creators were denied the public domain that every other creator in the history of the human race had enjoyed. As 2019 drew nearer, the copyright resistance who had fought over this grew nervous, then…elated. Was Congress actually going to heed the evidence of a decades-long failed experiment and decline to extend copyright again? https://archive.org/details/MarybethPetersFormerUsRegisterOfCopyrightsOnTermsBeingTooLong I had pitched email debates with comrades over this. Michael S Hart, visionary founder of the Project Gutenberg, was certain it wouldn’t happen (he didn’t live to see it). But then, miraculously, astoundingly, 2019 rolled around and we got new works in the public domain! https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2019/ For decades, Jennifer Jenkins from the Duke Center for the Study of the Public Domain published an annual lament for the public domain works we weren’t getting that year. Jenkins painstakingly cataloged the materials that the public would be denied, though their creators had been only too happy to release them with the belief that the copyright would be 40 years shorter than it turned out. Starting in 2019, those laments turned into celebrations, starter pistols for a generation of creators discovering a living public domain for the first time since the Carter administration. The 1923 works that entered the public domain in 2019 were mostly curiosities, but with each successive year, the public domain’s new arrivals get ever more vibrant. The public domain shipment that arrived on January 1, 2023 was a banger: we got some Virginia Woolf, some Hemingway, some Kafka, some Faulkner, some Agatha Christie and Edith Wharton, as well as Proust and Hesse: https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/20/free-for-2023/#oy-canada All of Sherlock Holmes came home to the public domain last year. We also got “Ol’ Man River,” “Puttin’ On the Ritz” and “Mississippi Mud.” What we didn’t get 2023? Sound recordings. The Music Modernization Act froze all sound recordings in copyright until 2024 – that is, until 11 days hence. Those old 78RPM recordings exist in an odd superposition. On the one hand, they have real cultural value and bring great joy to many listeners. On the other hand, they produce either zero (in the case of out-of-print recordings) or very little revenue for labels. The Internet Archive, a public library, has preserved over 400,000 of these recordings through its Great 78 Project. Like every library with a sound recording collection, the Archive lends out access to these recordings to people with library cards: https://great78.archive.org/ But the record industry has decided to attack the library and its founder. In a lawsuit that could shut down the Internet Archive and bankrupt its founder, they claim that internet-based libraries can’t do what their physical counterparts have done since literal time immemorial: https://blog.archive.org/2023/08/14/internet-archive-responds-to-recording-industry-lawsuit-targeting-obsolete-media/ The Big Three labels (Universal, Sony and Warner) who bought out all their rivals until three companies ended up owning 70% of all in-copyright sound recordings do not take their responsibility to preserve the recording history they bought and now would exercise eternal dominance over. Even as they attack independent efforts to preserve our culture, they fail grotesquely to preserve it on their own: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/magazine/universal-fire-master-recordings.html January 1 won’t change any of that: come this year’s public domain day, the record labels will still own the vast majority of all the music in the world, and they’ll still be indifferently preserving it, and they’ll still be trying to kill the Internet Archive and the Wayback Machine, and they’ll still be trying to eviscerate Brewster Kahle. But at least we’ll get some music in the public domain again this year. Indeed, this year’s public domain is shaping up to be an even bigger banger than 2023: https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2024/ The majority of works entering the public domain this year are from 1928, six years before the Hays Code – a regime of self-censorship overseen by the motion picture cartel that banned sex, radical politics, queerness, and everything else good in this world for generations – came into effect. 1928 was the year that the “Magna Charta” of the movie cartel was adopted – a set of voluntary guidelines that were roundly ignored by the studios: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hays_Code#Pre-Code:<em>%22Don’ts%22_and</em>%22Be_Carefuls%22,_as_proposed_in_1927 The late 1920s were super horny. This year’s public domain time-capsule from 1928 includes DH Lawrence’s Lady Chatterley’s Lover, Cole Porter’s Let’s Do It, Virginia Woolf’s Orlando, Khan and Donaldson’s Makin’ Whoopee, and, horniest of all, Milne’s House at Pooh Corner, featuring the first appearance of literature’s greatest perennial sex-pest: Tigger. Getting all this sexy stuff from 1928 in 2024 – when panicked bigots are waging war on sex in popular culture – is quite timely. These pietist prigs keep acting like sex in popular culture, “where the children can see it,” was invented five years ago by Scholastic editors with purple hair, neopronouns and septum piercings. Earth to Moms For Liberty: the “good old days,” free from sex in culture, ended 2 billion years ago when horny eukaryotes invented fucking. But 1928 wasn’t all flappers doing the horizontal Charleston with college men in the backs of jalopies. Our newly liberated cultural forebears found time to create the Marx Brothers’ Animal Crackers, Brecht’s Threepenny Opera (including Mack the Knife), and Agatha Christie’s The Mystery of the Blue Train. WEB Dubois’s Dark Princess comes home to the public domain on Jan 1. So do Robert Frost’s West-Running Brook and Buster Keaton’s The Cameraman. We’re getting Charlie Chaplin’s The Circus and Leni’s The Man Who Laughs, which Bob Kane plundered to create The Joker. You can record Sonny Boy, I Can’t Give You Anything But Love or I Wanna Be Loved By You. In addition to all the compositions entering the public domain in a few days, there’s the first shipment of recordings in two years: the Charleston, Yes, We Have No Bananas, and Satchmo singing with King Oliver’s Creole Jazz Band on Dipper Mouth Blues and Froggie More. Also noteworthy: the works of MC Escher are starting to enter the public domain. The records are fragmentary, but Tower Of Babel is yours for the taking on Jan 1 (this is especially satisfying given that the estate is a noteworthy bully that has sent me baseless threats). There’s a lot of other visual art that may be entering the public domain in 2024, but because the registration records are so poorly organized, it’s hard to tell. A lot of that art may not have been registered or renewed, and already be in the public domain. 80% of the books published between 1924 and 1963 are in the public domain on this basis! https://www.crummy.com/2019/07/22/0 Among those works that are Secretly Public Domain? HP Lovecraft’s Call of Cthulhu, which has been public domain since 1956 (the Lovecraft estate is another one of those bullying monsters who will be put out of business soon, thanks to the reawakened public domain). The main event, of course, is Mickey Mouse, who enters the public domain along with his first two short cartoon appearances: Plane Crazy and Steamboat Willie. Though there’s been a lot of FUD about trademark keeping Mickey out of the public domain, it’s a lie. He’s all yours (mostly): https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/15/mouse-liberation-front/#free-mickey It’s wonderful to see the public domain growing again, but spare a thought for the orphan works whose copyright caging outlasted the works themselves. This year saw several silent films entering the public domain – but some of those films no longer exist in their entirety, or at all. They were set afire in the slow-motion arson attack on our culture the monopolistic entertainment industry began 40+ years ago. Today, the world’s worst people remain in charge of that culture, and they’re still destroying it. David Zaslav, the loathsome villain of this year’s writers’ strike and actors’ strike, has pioneered the permanent erasure of beloved movies and TV shows as a cheap way of getting tax credits for the bloated post-merger behemoth of that is Discovery-Warner: https://insidethemagic.net/2023/04/warner-bros-under-fire-for-destroying-history-af1/ The purpose of a system is what it does. It’s not that the media execs who demanded copyright extensions in the seventies and nineties failed to foresee that this was a mass cultural extinction event. It’s that they didn’t care. David Zaslav burning down his own company’s vault is part of a multigenerational tradition in his industry. Those media execs know exactly what they’re doing. They just don’t care.

<h2 id="report-warns-of-attempt-to-criminalize-newsgathering-in-the-us">Report Warns of Attempt to ‘Criminalize’ Newsgathering in the US</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — At least a dozen journalists faced arrest or charges related to their newsgathering across the U.S. in 2023, with most working for local media outlets.</p>
<p>The incidents and their impact on the ability of journalists to cover the news are detailed in a report released Wednesday by the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker.</p>
<p>Based in New York, the Tracker has documented what it sees as press freedom violations inside the U.S. since 2017.</p>
<p>According to the Tracker, many of the cases this year involved attempts to prevent journalists from engaging in regular reporting practices — from asking questions to investigating public officials. It cited around 30 cases of journalists or media outlets being summoned and asked to identify a source or hand over reporting materials.</p>
<p>“What was interesting this year was an apparent criminalization of general newsgathering,” said Stephanie Sugars, the report’s author.</p>
<p>The number of cases of journalists arrested is lower than previous years, when the Tracker documented dozens of cases as media covered unrest and large-scale protests. Still, the findings are a concern, the nonpartisan group said.</p>
<p>In one case from October, police arrested a small-town Alabama newspaper publisher and a reporter for publishing an article that authorities said contained confidential grand jury evidence.</p>
<p>While leaking information may be illegal, it is not a crime for news outlets to publish that information, so long as the reporters are not involved in illegally obtaining the materials, press experts say.</p>
<p>In another case, a reporter at an Illinois newspaper was cited for asking city officials too many questions about flooding in October.</p>
<p>“That is normal newsgathering,” Sugars told VOA from New York.</p>
<p>In the Illinois case, the charges were dropped.</p>
<p>In a separate incident in Ohio, NewsNation correspondent Evan Lambert was ordered to stop a live broadcast while Governor Mike DeWine was giving a press briefing in February. Officers then forced Lambert to the ground and arrested him.</p>
<p>The governor expressed concern and said he was not aware of the incident at the time it occurred.</p>
<p>Lambert filed a lawsuit in November over the incident.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an Arizona judge in April granted a restraining order against a local reporter after the journalist looked into a state senator’s residency claims. Another judge later rejected the restraining order. And in July, two California reporters were accused by a local police union of stalking for trying to contact a police officer at her home.</p>
<p>“Attempts to criminalize routine journalistic activities, such as contacting public officials or the subjects of stories, send a chill through the heart of newsgathering,” Sugars wrote in the report.</p>
<p>It’s unclear whether police and officials in these incidents were unaware of what constitutes normal newsgathering or whether they just didn’t care, Sugars said.</p>
<p>But, she added, that distinction also misses the point.</p>
<p>“Whether they know that it is general, basic newsgathering or not is less important than the fact that they just don’t like it and are using the tools at their disposal to retaliate,” Sugars said.</p>
<p>Another factor that links many of the cases in the Press Freedom Tracker’s report is that most incidents took place at the local level, affecting smaller or regional publications.</p>
<p>That’s likely a byproduct of the decline of local news coverage, according to Sugars.</p>
<p>The U.S. has lost more than one fourth of its newspapers since 2005 and is set to lose one third of all its roughly 6,000 remaining print newspapers — mostly weeklies — by 2025, according to a report by Northwestern University’s Local News Initiative.</p>
<p>“That lack of constant scrutiny has created an atmosphere where local officials feel like they are no longer responsible for answering questions,” Sugars said.</p>
<p>First Amendment experts say such violations make it harder for journalists to do their jobs.</p>
<p>“If you’ve got these instances of law enforcement overreach, again, it impairs the press’s watchdog role,” said Gabe Rottman of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, or RCFP.</p>
<p>Rottman, who is director of the RCFP’s Technology and Press Freedom Project, said that it is important for government officials to understand the role journalists play in their community.</p>
<p>Fewer journalists were arrested or charged in the United States in 2023 than in the past few years, the Tracker report found.</p>
<p>But other violations — such as the police raid on the Marion County Record in Kansas — indicate that the First Amendment still faces its fair share of assaults, analysts say.</p>
<p>Since the Press Freedom Tracker began monitoring violations in 2017, the worst years for arrests were 2017, 2020 and 2021, all of which featured large-scale protests.</p>
<p>Covering protests is regularly the most dangerous assignment for journalists in the United States, according to Sugars.</p>
<p>She said that arrests or legal action against media in the U.S. should concern everyone— even if the journalists are thousands of miles away — because press freedom violations in one corner of the country risk emboldening would-be perpetrators elsewhere.</p>
<p>“Every single violation can be a steppingstone for the next,” Sugars said.</p>
<p>With the U.S. headed for elections in 2024, Sugars said, the Tracker will be closely monitoring for press freedom violations.</p>

<h2 id="negotiations-over-us-aid-to-ukraine-expected-to-stretch-past-christmas">Negotiations Over US Aid to Ukraine Expected to Stretch Past Christmas</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Capitol Hill — U.S. lawmakers will work into the Christmas holiday next week, seeking to negotiate a deal on border security in return for Republican votes to send more aid to Ukraine.</p>
<p>“Challenging issues remain, but we are committed to addressing needs at the southern border and to helping allies and partners confront serious threats in Israel, Ukraine and the Indo-Pacific. The Senate will not let these national security challenges go unanswered,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a joint statement late Tuesday.</p>
<p>“As negotiators work through remaining issues, it is our hope that their efforts will allow the Senate to take swift action on the national security supplemental early in the new year,” the statement continued.</p>
<p>Schumer told reporters earlier Tuesday that while he is optimistic about the progress of negotiations, lawmakers need more time.</p>
<p>“The details in this matter immensely, because this is not a topic that Congress has tackled in many years. We know that this is going to be not easy to do,” said the Senate’s top Democrat. “But we know too, that we must get it done. And while we’ve made important progress over the past week on border security, everyone agrees on both sides that it takes more time.”</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell also acknowledged the difficulties, noting the last major piece of legislation on immigration and border security became law in the late 1980s.</p>
<p>“We haven’t passed a significant immigration bill since Reagan’s second term. This is not easy. But we’re working hard to get an outcome because the country needs it, and the country needs it soon,” McConnell told reporters Tuesday, referring to former president Ronald Reagan who served in the 1980s.</p>
<p>The United States has already dedicated more than $100 billion to arming and supporting Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, and President Joe Biden has asked Congress to approve another $60 billion. Republicans in Congress have become increasingly skeptical about the need to continue underwriting Ukraine’s defense.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Republicans in the Senate have conditioned approval of any additional money for Ukraine on the simultaneous strengthening of immigration rules aimed at reducing the number of people illegally entering the United States at its southern border and expelling some who are already in the country.</p>
<p>The White House has warned there is only enough for one more military aid package to Ukraine before funding runs out at year’s end.</p>
<p>“The United States has done the preponderance of military support,” Colin Cleary, an adjunct professor at the George Washington University and a veteran of the Foreign Service who served in Ukraine, told VOA.</p>
<p>“The crisis really would be on the military side if aid didn’t happen. And in those two dimensions — the positional warfare that requires a lot of ammunition and supplies, and also the protection of the civilian infrastructure through air defense,” he said.</p>
<p>Even if an agreement passes in the Senate, it might not survive in the House, where Republicans hold a very narrow majority. A significant group of Republican House members opposes additional aid to Ukraine, and the party recently voted out a speaker who partnered with Democrats to pass legislation.</p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson, who took over after predecessor Kevin McCarthy was ousted, has said that more funding for the border is essential to any Ukrainian aid package; however, he also wants more conditions placed on the aid.</p>
<p>“What the Biden administration seems to be asking for is billions of additional dollars with no appropriate oversight, no clear strategy to win, and none of the answers that I think the American people are owed,” he said last week.</p>
<p>International reaction</p>
<p>Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin publicly celebrated the fact that Ukraine appears to be losing support in the West.</p>
<p>“Ukraine today produces nearly nothing; they are trying to preserve something, but they don’t produce practically anything themselves and bring everything in for free,” he said, according to The Associated Press. “But the freebies may end at some point and apparently it’s coming to an end little by little.”</p>
<p>While opponents of aid to Ukraine often denigrate aid packages as being a “blank check” handed over to the Ukrainian government, most of the aid is in the form of military hardware. The dollar figures in the aid packages mostly represent money spent in the U.S. to pay arms manufacturers for the equipment the U.S. ships to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Tuesday he was confident the U.S. would not “betray” his country by withholding crucial wartime funding as it fights off a Russian invasion.</p>
<p>“We are working very hard on this, and I am certain the United States of America will not betray us, and that on which we agreed in the United States will be fulfilled completely,” Zelenskyy said during a televised news briefing in Kyiv.</p>

<p>date: 2023-12-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — A U.S. court on Wednesday unsealed an indictment charging an alleged senior Hezbollah operative with terrorism charges, in part for coordinating a 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires that killed 85 people. </p>
<p>Federal prosecutors in Manhattan said Samuel Salman El Reda, 58, had coordinated Hezbollah’s activities in South America, Asia and Lebanon since 1993. The Iran-backed, heavily armed Shiite group is part of Lebanon’s coalition government.  </p>
<p>Prosecutors said El Reda is based in Lebanon and remains at large. The U.S. State Department in 2019 sanctioned El Reda and offered a $7 million reward for information on his whereabouts.  </p>
<p>Argentina also blames Hezbollah for a 1992 attack on the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires that killed 29 people.</p>

<h2 id="chinese-telecom-giant-huawei-pushes-forward-with-ambitious-plan-to-dethrone-android">Chinese telecom giant Huawei pushes forward with ambitious plan to dethrone Android</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-20, from: OS News</p>
<p>Hundreds of technical experts from many of China’s biggest state-owned and private companies, including the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China Telecom, Meituan, and Baidu, all gathered in Beijing last month. The purpose behind the meeting was for their staff to receive training so they could be certified as developers on Huawei’s Harmony Operation System (OS). While most observers were looking the other way, Huawei has been quietly building an independent Chinese operating system that isn’t subject to U.S. sanctions. In the four years after the telecom giant was banned from using Google apps, the Shenzhen-based company has been making significant strides toward achieving its long-term goal: To dethrone Android and make its HarmonyOS the default operating system in China. ↫ Nina Xiang for Forbes Asia HarmonyOS is poised to succeed in beating iOS and Android where others have failed, if only because the Chinese state is pushing homegrown solutions hard. It’s already hit 10% market share in China, closing in on iOS’ 17%, but still kilometres away from Android’s 72%. However, with both local governments and the government in Beijing enacting all kinds of laws and guidelines to force companies, institutions, and people to switch to homegrown solutions, it wouldn’t surprise me to see this market share climb fast. And that’s actually okay! Setting aside the fact the Chinese government is a genocidal totalitarian surveillance nightmare apparatus, I think it’s entirely understandable, reasonable, and a good investment to have homegrown technology solutions and platforms. I wish the European Union did something similar, but that ship has probably sailed after we let Microsoft gut whatever was left of Nokia after Apple was done with it.</p>

<h2 id="japan-court-orders-okinawa-to-approve-modified-plan-to-build-runways-for-us-marine-corps">Japan Court Orders Okinawa to Approve Modified Plan to Build Runways for US Marine Corps</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TOKYO — A Japanese court on Wednesday ordered the governor of Okinawa to approve the central government’s modified plan for landfill work at the planned relocation site of a key U.S. military base on the southern island despite persistent opposition and protests by residents. </p>
<p>The decision will move forward the suspended construction at a time Okinawa’s strategic importance is becoming key for the Japan-U.S. military alliance in the face of growing tensions with China. Japan also rapidly seeks to build up its military in the southwestern region. </p>
<p>The ruling by the Fukuoka High Court Naha branch allows the Land and Transport Ministry to order the modification work designed to reinforce extremely soft ground at the designated relocation site for U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, overriding Gov. Denny Tamaki’s disapproval. The ruling ordered Tamaki to issue the approval within three working days. </p>
<p>Tamaki said it was unjust that the will of the residents is crushed by the central government. </p>
<p>Tamaki, noting the spirit of local government autonomy and democracy, said in a statement that the ruling that allows the government’s forcible execution of its planned construction of a new military base is “absolutely unacceptable.” </p>
<p>If completed, the new site will serve a key Marine Corps facility for the region and also will be home to MV-22 Ospreys that are currently deployed at Futenma. </p>
<p>Tamaki can still appeal to the Supreme Court, but the local government at this point has no power to stop the work unless the top court overturns the decision. </p>
<p>Okinawa and the central government have long tussled over the relocation of the Futenma base. </p>
<p>The Japanese and U.S. governments initially agreed in 1996 to close the Futenma air station a year after the rape of a schoolgirl by three U.S. military personnel led to a massive anti-base movement. But persistent protests and lawsuits between Okinawa and Tokyo have held up the plan for nearly 30 years. </p>
<p>Japan’s central government began the reclamation work off Henoko Bay on the eastern coast of Okinawa in 2018 to pave the way for the relocation of the Futenma base from its crowded neighborhood on the island. </p>
<p>The central government later found out that large areas of the designated reclamation site are on soft ground, which some experts described “as soft as mayonnaise,” and submitted a revision to the original plan with additional land improvement. But Okinawa’s prefectural government rejected the revision plan and suspended the reclamation work. </p>
<p>The ground improvement plan requires tens of thousands of pillars and massive amounts of soil, which opponents say would damage the environment. It is expected to cost 930 billion yen ($6.5 billion), 2.5 times the initial estimate, and take 12 years to finish, according to the Defense Ministry. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court in September turned down Okinawa’s appeal in another lawsuit that ordered the prefecture to withdraw its rejection of the modified landfill plan. </p>
<p>Tamaki has called for a significant reduction of the U.S. military on the island, which is home to more than half of 50,000 American troops based in Japan under the bilateral security pact. Tamaki also has demanded the immediate closure of Futenma base and the scrapping of the base construction at Henoko. Okinawa accounts for just 0.6% of Japanese land. </p>
<p>Tokyo and Washington say the relocation within Okinawa, instead of moving it elsewhere as demanded by many Okinawans, is the only solution. </p>
<p>“We believe that action should be taken promptly in line with this ruling,” Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said. He pledged that the government will continue to make effort for the return of the Futenma air station as soon as possible to reduce the burden from the base.</p>

With the new year, the IRS will resume sending reminder letters to taxpayers with old debts to the federal government, which were paused during the pandemic. But to avoid causing sticker shock when people receive reminders, the IRS is waiving the penalties it usually charges for back taxes. We dig in. And later, a boost in U.S. oil production spoils OPEC’s effort to prop up prices.

<h2 id="theyre-letting-us-have-rss">They’re letting us have RSS</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-20, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Assume that FB doesn’t really want to interop, so that’s why there’s a year timeline on developing AP functionality. No rush. Let’s keep growing and later on we can have an app store that only lets certain sites into our world, subject to our turning them off at any time.
</p>
<p>
Assuming this is true, RSS is their worst nightmare. It’s implemented in a week, if you’re really careful and there are good toolkits for every platform, and lots of developers know what to do with it, and even worse, there already is a huge installed base of such apps and they all have <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vociferous">vociferous</a> users who would be thrilled to be heard, because they largely feel like they’re pissing in the wind. I am doing CSS coding far in advance of my previous capability, when I know something is possible, but I haven’t the slightest idea how to specify it.
</p>
<p>
Remember they said RSS is Dead. I always felt that was aimed at me, but it was aimed at them too, even more so.
</p>
<p>
The thing to do, build – intelligently, slowly, showing interop at every step. Watch out for people who take stuff out with out putting back.

<p>If journalism wants to help inform the populace of the stakes, I’d like them to stop using the term neo-Nazi. There’s nothing new about being a Nazi. It adds a tiny bit of confusion at exactly the point where you want zero confusion. It took journalism a long time to use the term insurrection about the January 6 events, that hurt us too. Understand where the path we’re on leads, and don’t give people a reason to hope that it’s not as serious as it is.</p>

<p>The mental health of journalists has been steadily deteriorating since the pandemic.

<p>
What can a beloved, sugary holiday treat teach us about trade protectionism, overseas farm subsidies, inflation and inelastic demand? Turns out, quite a bit. Today, we trace how sugarcane from Louisiana becomes a hand-spun, red-and-white-striped delight at a New Jersey candy shop — and learn a thing or two about economics along the way. But first: The Senate leaves for a holiday recess without any approved aid for Ukraine or Israel.

But “Bird grew too quickly — it launched in too many cities before it had a viable model,” one former employee <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=fa613a140e&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> the<em> Financial Times</em>. “It was losing money on every ride, so the more cities and more rides it was doing the more money it lost.” The company went public in 2021 but its stock plummeted quickly and never really recovered.

<li>Biden moves to protect ‘old growth’ forests

<p style>
<strong></strong>President Biden issued a <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=ce7ee686d9&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proposal</a> yesterday to protect some of the oldest trees in America’s national forests from commercial logging. The move has climate ramifications because older trees are natural carbon sinks, so keeping them alive prevents that carbon from being released into the atmosphere and contributing to global warming. “Older forests provide the most above-ground carbon storage potential on Earth, with mature forests and larger trees driving most accumulation of forest carbon in the critical next few decades,” a group of scientists wrote in a <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=82e0cac143&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">letter</a> to Biden last year. “Left vulnerable to logging, though, they cannot fulfill these vital functions.” The proposal doesn’t protect “mature” trees, which aren’t quite as ancient as “old growth” trees. This concession is “a middle ground between environmentalists and the timber industry,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=80e50a04bb&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">says</a> Lauren Aratani at <em>The Guardian</em>. The ban is set to come into place in 2025 and comes as part of an executive order, so whether it goes ahead could depend on the outcome of the 2024 election.

<li>California will start turning wastewater into drinking water
</h3>
<p style>
<strong></strong>California officials yesterday approved regulations allowing wastewater from toilets and showers to be recycled into drinking water for hundreds of thousands of people. “As we look to make our communities more resilient to drought, to climate change, this is really going to be an important part of that solution,” Heather Cooley, director of research at water think tank Pacific Institute, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=0b72864112&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tells</a> the<em> Los Angeles Times</em>. Colorado has similar rules in place already, and Arizona and Florida could soon follow suit. The wastewater recycling process has undergone extensive review by scientists and engineers who insist it is clean and safe. The water is filtered, decontaminated, disinfected, and monitored, making it “purer than many drinking water sources we now rely on,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=62607efa33&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">says</a> E. Joaquin Esquivel, chair of the state’s water resources board.

The deal will last for 10 years and the money is expected to help pay for museum upgrades and refurbishments. The sponsorship isn’t new: BP has partnered with the museum since 1996. But it comes at a time when cultural institutions in Britain and elsewhere are under pressure from climate activists to cut ties with fossil fuel companies. One activist group has threatened legal action in response to the move, and Greenpeace <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=350c1ea918&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called it</a> “brazen greenwashing.” But, as the <em>Times</em> of London <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e6f0fe5bb0&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">points out</a>, most of Britain’s museums charge nothing for entrance and rely heavily on philanthropy and sponsorship. “Money needs to come from somewhere,” the paper says.

<em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Airbnb has been ordered to pay up to $20 million in fines and compensation after misleading customers in Australia. Some bookings there were listed in U.S. dollars rather than Australian dollars, making them look cheaper than they actually were. Plus, we look at the delisting of Toshiba in Japan. And later: Inflation can even affect candy canes.

<h2 id="us-baby-boomers-over-70-hold-more-than-30-of-countrys-wealth">US baby boomers over 70 hold more than 30% of country’s wealth</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-20, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Most don&amp;#8217;t work anymore, but Americans age 70 and older have seen their share of collective wealth surge during the pandemic. As a group, these older baby boomers have accumulated more than $14 trillion in additional net worth since the end 2019, based on Federal Reserve data. Their share of the country&amp;#8217;s wealth has jumped to a record 30% last quarter, even though they account for 11% of the population. The aging population helps explain some the gains: There are about 2.3 million more people over 70 in the country than in 2019. But one major driver was the surge in home values and stocks during the pandemic, which benefited older generations most likely to own a house &amp;#8212; or two &amp;#8212; and hold equities or mutual funds.&lt;/p&gt;

<h2 id="hex-time">Hex time</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-20, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Hex time
</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>
My wife left to spend the day in a spa with a friend of hers and I am listening to Louis Armstrong recordings from the 1930s.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I read a discussion between <a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@munroe" title="@munroe@dice.camp"><span class="citation" data-cites="munroe">@munroe</span></a> and <a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@Da_Gut" title="@Da_Gut@dice.camp"><span class="citation" data-cites="Da_Gut">@Da_Gut</span></a> about hex sizes for a hexcrawl. My personal take is to think of hexes as distances one can travel in a certain time.
</p>
<p>
Think about the diversity of the landscape one can see in a day of travel. Arable lands and a forest. Two regions? Arable lands, a forest, hills, a plateau. Four? That is the number of hexes per day. And nobody cares about the miles.
</p>
<p>
In my case, I think that “one hex is one day of walking” makes the most sense. In the morning, you’re leaving one hex and in the afternoon you’re arriving in the next hex. This assumes an uncharted wilderness. When I try to leave the forest trails in the hills around Zürich or in the Swiss mountains, I feel that progress is really slow. Super slow. Extremely slow. Sure, I can walk as far as the horizon in some cases, but that’s on gravel roads prepared by industrial machines and maintained by a state that is fed by all the tax evading billionaires and conglomerates of the whole planet. So out there in Fantasy land, it’s more like me trying to find a shortcut in the Swiss mountains and forests.
</p>
<p>
And sure, if people have horses and mules to carry their stuff, they can travel faster. Twice as fast makes it easy to move the little token around on the map. And roads also speed things up. Like, twice as fast? With horses and mules to carry stuff, on a flat road: 4 hexes per day. If you want to read up on ancient rows, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_roads_and_trails">historic roads and trails</a> on Wikipedia.
</p>
<p>
Regular exploration of the wilderness where the players are strangers, intruders, colonizers, potential murderers, belonging to the wannabe-conquerors, then surely it’s going to be 1 hex per day. This is the equivalent of slow and careful dungeon exploration speed. Avoid getting lost in the bogs, crossing the rivers and creeks without losing your stuff, without getting ambushed in gullies and canyons, without getting lost in forests, without slipping into ravines, spraining angles or scraping your knees, keeping dry, finding good camping sites, digging a latrine, digging a fire pit, washing clothes, maintaining equipment, baking bread, and on and on. This is the speed you can maintain for long expeditions.
</p>
<p>
Now, you can get into all the nitty-gritty of it all. Luckily, <a class="account" href="https://rollenspiel.social/@settembrini" title="@settembrini@rollenspiel.social"><span class="citation" data-cites="settembrini">@settembrini</span></a> already did all that and wrote <a href="https://hofrat.rsp-blogs.de/2023/12/01/inch-by-inch-its-all-a-cinch-by-the-yard-its-hard/">Inch by inch it’s all a cinch, by the yard it’s hard</a>. It’s a long article and not an easy read. But here’s one of the things I can put into my gamer notes:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
1 hour’s walk = 1 league = 3 miles = 3000 double paces = 15 000 feet= 5000 yards.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
So let’s go back to my example. Using the above equivalences, 8 hours of walking takes you 24 miles out in the open, on a road or well kept and straight trail. At the same time, I said that 1 day of walking is 2 hexes in my world, without mules or horses. So now we know: one day of walking is 24 miles and 2 hexes. Therefore my hexes should be 12 miles across, if you really need to know.
</p>
<p>
But of course you don’t because nothing happens “per mile” in the game. All the things happen “per unit of time”. The most important one of these is “how many random encounters per day?” Or “per 4 hour watch?”
</p>
<p>
I’m serious about one thing, however: It’s better if you don’t think about the miles per hex. If you do, you’ll keep thinking about all the other things, too. How far was your hike last summer? Did you have to set up camp? How heavy was your backpack? Did you wear armour? Is travelling by horse really faster than walking by foot if you can’t switch horses? How fast are you if you have two horses per person? How fast is a wagon. The questions are endless and somehow I find them all very boring questions. These are not <a href="2023-01-20_The_power_of_questions.md">good questions</a>.
</p>
<p>
It’s better if you think about what’s important in the game for you and the table and go from there. Is the world dangerous because of random encounters? Start with the question of how often you want to roll for random encounters as the party travels from landmark to landmark. Think about the distances between settlements. Traditionally, that would be about a day’s march by foot in arable land: half a day out and do a bit of work and half a day back is the limit.
</p>
<p>
So let’s say you answered the above with “I’m going to roll once for random encounters per day of travel”. And every landmark has something: either it’s arable land so there are people living there, a camp, a hamlet, a village, or it’s dangerous because of a monster lair, or because of a natural hazard like mountains, swamps, deep forest, or something else that’s similarly inhospitable.
</p>
<p>
If you follow this train of thought then you’ll arrive at my setup: the slowest speed is one hex per day, and then there are ways to speed things up with transporation methods and infrastructure. Take a boat downriver or along the coast: 8 hexes per day? More? What about taking a boat upriver? Just as slow as walking but you can unlimited supplies? How far can the flying carpet go? All these questions need settling, eventually. All I am concerned about right now, however, is that they can be answered in principle: a certain multiple of the slowest speed is good enough.
</p>
<p>
The only good argument for switching things up that I can think of is wanting to present more variety to your players. No problem. If the land is full of stuff, a river ford, a tower ruin, then up onto the plateau and into the moors until you reach the cairns of Arguable, you can scale it up. Multiply it all by two or three or four and you’re good to go. I find that this leads to a lot more mapping and so I don’t do it, but if you feel like it, you have my blessings.
</p>
<p>
If you are like me and prefer more diversity in theory but cannot be bothered to map in practice, I have a suggestion: start with the sparse map and keep adding. Using the example above, there’s a hex with a settlement, and the next hex is hills, and there’s a river between the two. You can improvise a story about the fields giving way to brushland, the river winding its way between the willows and the ford with the poles of King Borgobob who raised them in the times of your grandfather, and then there’s that plateau. If the players don’t look for the tower, it does not show up. But if the players know about the old tower you add a tower symbol to the hill hex and presto, one more landmark in the same hex. They know about the cairn, too? Then it’s a tower and a cairn. You can even number the sides of a hex: 1 is north, 2 is south-east, 3 is south-west, and so on. Then your notes can say “1: cairn, 4: old tower” and depending on how the party crosses the hexes, you’ll know whether they pass by the thing or wether they can spot it from a distance or whether they’ll have to search for it.
</p>
<p>
I also like to label geographic features. Label settlements, forests, mountains, swamps, rivers, trails. I feel that adds so much.
</p>
<p>
Down below is a snapshot of the player map in my German Greyhawk campaign where I run the Elredd region on the Wild Coast. How long does it take to travel from Elredd to Moorwies along the Miesbohlenweg? 1 hex/day in the wilderness, 2 hexes/day on the road: From Elredd to Brackmühl is a day, from Brackmühl to Kreuzdorf is a day, and from Kreuzdorf to Moorwies is half a day, or perhaps the swamp slows things down and the road is shit so it’s a full day. So three days total. If you had horses, then it’s one day from Elredd to Kreuzdorf, and then the shit trackway into the swamp… a second day? Or maybe you can travel right through Moorwies and out of the swamp on the other side. But my players don’t know what lies to the west…
</p>
<p>
OK, but now I have a different problem. <a class="account" href="https://rollenspiel.ch/users/settembrini" title="@settembrini@rollenspiel.ch"><span class="citation" data-cites="settembrini">@settembrini</span></a> says that each hex is 10 km across. Now what? Let’s take those equivalences again and add a rough conversion to kilometers. 3 miles × 1½ km/mi = 4½ km or 5000 years × 9/10 m/yard = 4500 m = 4½ km. Let’s round that to 5 km – or in keeping with this blog post: a 10 km hex takes 2 h to walk through and in 8 h you can walk through 4 hexes, if you’re on a road, 2 hexes cross-country, 8 hexes if you ride on a good road. Speed is sort-of doubled because 12 mi × 1½ km/mi = 18 km which is nearly twice as much as 10 km.
</p>
<p>
So bow how long does it take to travel from Elredd to Moorwies along the Miesbohlen way? 1 day from Elredd to Kreuzdorf. Plus 2 h on the next day.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
1 hour’s walk = 1 league = 3 miles = 3000 double paces = 15 000 feet= 5000 yards = 5 km
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
My point with all of this: keep in mind how the map relates to events in your <a href="-20_Hexcrawl_Procedure2012-06-20_Hexcrawl_Procedure">hexcrawl procedure</a>. With the “new” ruling handed down to me regarding my map, I keep the idea that there is a single encounter check to be made during the day (and one to be made during the night if the party is camping out in the open).

<h2 id="trump-defends-comments-about-immigrants-poisoning-the-blood-of-america">Trump Defends Comments About Immigrants ‘Poisoning the Blood’ of America</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WATERLOO, Iowa — Former U.S.  President Donald Trump on Tuesday defended his comments about migrants crossing the southern border “poisoning the blood” of America, and he reinforced the message while denying any similarities to fascist writings others had noted.</p>
<p>“I never read ‘Mein Kampf,’” Trump said at a campaign rally in Waterloo, Iowa, referencing Adolf Hitler’s fascist manifesto.</p>
<p>Immigrants in the U.S. illegally, Trump said Tuesday, are “destroying the blood of our country, they’re destroying the fabric of our country.”</p>
<p>In the speech to more than 1,000 supporters from a podium flanked by Christmas trees in red MAGA hats, Trump responded to mounting criticism about his anti-immigrant “blood” purity rhetoric over the weekend.</p>
<p>Several politicians and extremism experts have noted his language echoed writings from Hitler about the “purity” of Aryan blood, which underpinned Nazi Germany’s systematic murder of millions of Jews and other “undesirables” before and during World War II.</p>
<p>As illegal border crossings surge, topping 10,000 some days in December, Trump continued to blast Biden for allowing migrants to “pour into our country.” He alleged, without offering evidence, that they bring crime and potential disease with them.</p>
<p>“They come from Africa, they come from Asia, they come from South America,” he said, lamenting what he said was a “border catastrophe.”</p>
<p>Trump made no mention of the Colorado Supreme Court’s decision Tuesday to disqualify him from the state’s ballot under the U.S. Constitution’s insurrection clause, though his campaign blasted out a fundraising email about it during his speech.</p>
<p>The former president has long used inflammatory language about immigrants coming to the United States, dating back to his campaign launch in 2015, when he said immigrants from Mexico are “bringing drugs, they’re bringing crime, they’re rapists.”</p>
<p>But Trump has espoused increasingly authoritarian messages in his third campaign, vowing to renew and add to his effort to bar citizens from certain Muslim-majority countries, and to expand " ideological screening " for people immigrating to the U.S. He said he would be a dictator on “day one” only, in order to close the border and increase drilling.</p>
<p>In Waterloo on Tuesday, Trump’s supporters in the crowd said his border policies were effective and necessary, even if he doesn’t always say the right thing.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if he says the right words all of the time,” said 63-year-old Marylee Geist, adding that just because “you’re not fortunate enough to be born in this country,” doesn’t mean “you don’t get to come here.”</p>
<p>“But it should all be done legally,” she added.</p>
<p>It’s about the volume of border crossings and national security, said her husband, John Geist, 68.</p>
<p>“America is the land of opportunity, however, the influx — it needs to be kept to a certain level,” he said. “The amount of undocumented immigrants that come through and you don’t know what you’re getting, things aren’t regulated properly.”</p>
<p>Alex Litterer and her dad, Tom, of Charles City said they were concerned about migrants crossing the southern border, especially because the U.S. doesn’t have the resources to support that influx. But the 22-year-old said she didn’t agree with Trump’s comments, adding that immigrants who come to the country legally contribute to the country’s character and bring different perspectives.</p>
<p>Polling shows most Americans agree, with two-thirds saying the country’s diverse population makes the U.S. stronger.</p>
<p>But Trump’s “blood” purity message might resonate with some voters.</p>
<p>About a third of Americans overall worry that more immigration is causing U.S.-born Americans to lose their economic, political and cultural influence, according to a late 2021 poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.</p>
<p>Jackie Malecek, 50, of Waterloo said she likes Trump for the reasons that many people don’t — how outspoken he is and “that he’s a little bit of a loose cannon.” But she thought Trump saying immigrants are “poisoning the blood” took it a little too far.</p>
<p>“I’m very much for cutting off what’s happening at the border now. There’s too many people pouring in here right now, I watch it every single day,” Malecek said. “But that wording is not what I would have chosen to say.”</p>
<p>Malecek said she supports allowing legal immigration and accepting refugees, but she is concerned about the waves of migrants crossing the border who are not being vetted.</p>
<p>Sen. JD Vance, a Republican from Ohio, lashed out at a reporter asking about Trump’s “poisoning the blood” comments, defending them as a reference to overdoses from fentanyl smuggled over the border.</p>
<p>“You just framed your question implicitly assuming that Donald Trump is talking about Adolf Hitler. It’s absurd,” Vance said. “It is obvious that he was talking about the very clear fact that the blood of Americans is being poisoned by a drug epidemic.”</p>
<p>At a congressional hearing July 12, James Mandryck, a Customs and Border Protection deputy assistant commissioner, said 73% of fentanyl seizures at the border since the previous October were smuggling attempts carried out by U.S. citizens, with the rest being done by Mexican citizens.</p>
<p>Extremism experts say Trump’s rhetoric resembles the language that white supremacist shooters have used to justify mass killings.</p>
<p>Jon Lewis, a research fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, pointed to the 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue shooter and this year’s Texas mall shooter, who he said used similar language in writings before their attacks.</p>
<p>“Call it what it is,” said Lewis. “This is fascism. This is white supremacy. This is dehumanizing language that would not be out of place in a white supremacist Signal or Telegram chat.”</p>
<p>Asked about Trump’s “poisoning the blood” comments, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell replied with a quip about his own wife, an immigrant, who was an appointee in Trump’s administration.</p>
<p>“Well, it strikes me that didn’t bother him when he appointed Elaine Chao secretary of transportation,” McConnell said.</p>
<p>Trump currently leads other candidates, by far, in polls of likely Republican voters in Iowa and nationwide. Trump’s campaign is hoping for a knockout performance in the caucuses that will deny his rivals momentum and allow him to quickly lock up the nomination. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has staked his campaign on Iowa, raising expectations for him there.</p>
<p>“I will not guarantee it,” Trump said of winning Iowa next month, “but I pretty much guarantee it.”</p>

<p>I really dislike how the Lynx WWW browser looks on some modern systems. On my SGI it was OK - it simply respected IRIS terminal colors. On modern systems in seems to be full of colors with gray background. Text colors are quite nice but I have disliked the gray background. I have wished to have or black one or transparent one (it a terminal emulator supports transparency).</p>

<p>Things are continuously developing or at least changing. For example, my gVim on my GPD Pocket (Ubuntu MATE 18.04) has issues with text encoding. If I create a new file then I everything is OK. But when I save it and re-open it then it en-codes local language characters incorrectly. It is strange because I have been using the same .vimrc/.gvimrc for ages on several Linux machines and I never encountered such behaviour.</p>

<p>The PILOT Pentopia Chameleon stylus for Palm III and VI {sup}1{/sup} arrived today. It is a stylus with integrated reset pin and - last but not least - an actual pen. The pen refill is thin and it is labelled “Pilot” but I assume that a thin (non-pressurized) Fischer refill will fit here. This stylus has a bit different shape than the original Palm III pen and its tip is a bit harder but it is usable (I am writing this post with it). It is also little thicker than the original which is actually a plus - it sits more reliable in stylus housing of my heavily used Palms - I lost several styli from my old IIIxe and almost lost one of my TRGpro recently. The {sup}1{/sup} says that it is better for writing than the original stylus but I don’t think so. I see no improvement.</p>

<p>The title is all wrong because I extensively used the TRG Pro in the past. But the last time when I synced the TRG was in 2/2016 and then I have been using the original Palm III devices (IIIx + IIIxe) instead of the TRG. I have not wanted to damage or lost my only TRG Pro (which is pretty rare as you may know). Now I have two TRGs so I can use one of them on daily basis, I think.</p>

<h2 id="blue-origin-returns-to-space-after-year-long-hiatus">Blue Origin Returns to Space After Year-long Hiatus</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Blue Origin launched its first rocket in more than a year on Tuesday, reviving the U.S. company’s fortunes with a successful return to space following an uncrewed crash in 2022.</p>
<p>Though mission NS-24 carried a payload of science experiments, not people, it paves the way for Jeff Bezos’ aerospace enterprise to resume taking wealthy thrill-seekers to the final frontier.</p>
<p>The New Shepard suborbital rocket blasted off from the pad at Launch Site One, near Van Horn, Texas, at 10:42 a.m.</p>
<p>After separating from the booster, the gumdrop-shaped capsule attained a peak altitude of 107 kilometers above sea level, well above the internationally recognized boundary of space known as the Karman line, which is 100 kilometers high.</p>
<p>The booster then successfully landed vertically on the launchpad, against the majestic backdrop of the Sierra Diablo mountains, followed a few minutes later by the capsule floating to the desert floor on three giant parachutes.</p>
<p>All in all, the mission lasted 10 minutes and 13 seconds.</p>
<p>“Demand for New Shepard flights continues to grow, and we’re looking forward to increasing our flight cadence in 2024,” said Phil Joyce, the company’s senior vice president.</p>
<p>The science experiments onboard included one to demonstrate the operation of hydrogen fuel cell technology in microgravity, and another showing how water and gas move in a weightless environment.</p>
<p>Future applications could include monitoring water quality for astronauts in space.</p>
<p>On Sept. 12, 2022, a Blue Origin rocket became engulfed in flames shortly after launch. The capsule, fixed to the top of the rocket, successfully initiated an emergency separation sequence and floated safely to the ground on parachutes.</p>
<p>The accident prompted a year-long probe by the Federal Aviation Administration, which found it was caused by the failure of an engine nozzle that experienced higher-than-expected operating temperatures.</p>
<p>The regulator issued a set of corrective actions for Blue Origin to undertake before it could resume flying, including the redesign of certain engine parts. It confirmed Sunday that it had approved Blue Origin’s application to fly again.</p>
<p>In all, Blue Origin has carried out six crewed flights — some passengers were paying customers and others were guests — since July 2021, when Bezos himself took part in the first.</p>
<p>While Blue Origin has been grounded, rival Virgin Galactic — the company founded by British billionaire Richard Branson — has pressed on, with five commercial flights this year.</p>
<p>The two companies compete in the emerging space tourism sector, operating in suborbital space.</p>
<p>While Blue Origin launches a small rocket vertically, Virgin Galactic uses a large carrier plane to gain altitude and then drop off a smaller, rocket-powered spaceplane that completes the journey to space.</p>
<p>In both cases, passengers enjoy a few minutes of weightlessness and can view the curvature of the Earth through large windows.</p>
<p>Virgin Galactic tickets were sold for between $200,000 to $450,000; Blue Origin does not publicly disclose its ticket prices.</p>
<p>Blue Origin can boast the fact that nearly all of its rocket platform is reused, including the booster, capsule, engine, landing gear and parachutes.</p>
<p>Its engine, meanwhile, is fueled by liquid oxygen and hydrogen, meaning the only byproduct during flight is water vapor, with no carbon emissions.</p>
<p>Blue Origin is also developing a heavy rocket for commercial purposes called New Glenn, with the maiden flight planned for next year.</p>
<p>This rocket, which measures 98 meters high, is designed to carry payloads of as much as 45 metric tons into low Earth orbit.</p>

Not impotent tools, like congressional hearings or impeachment, but the actual guardrail meant to serve as a <a href="https://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment14/annotation15.html">last resort</a> to keep a nightmare out of the government. An insurrectionist should be dealt with a lot more swiftly than Trump has and the penalty should be harsh to warn off other would-be coup plotters. But – better late than never.

And if they want to have a civil war, okay – better to do it when the military is under constitutional control, at least theoretically. Tell the Republicans to try again, now before any primary votes have been cast. This candidate is prohibited from being president, as if he were born outside the United States. Not qualified.

<h2 id="drought-prone-california-oks-new-rules-for-turning-wastewater-directly-into-drinking-water-1">Drought-Prone California OKs New Rules for Turning Wastewater Directly Into Drinking Water</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-20, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SACRAMENTO, California — When a toilet is flushed in California, the water can end up in a lot of places: an ice skating rink in Ontario, ski slopes around Lake Tahoe, farmland in the Central Valley.</p>
<p>And — coming soon — kitchen faucets.</p>
<p>California regulators on Tuesday approved new rules to let water agencies recycle wastewater and put it right back into the pipes that carry drinking water to homes, schools and businesses.</p>
<p>It’s a big step for a state that has struggled for decades to secure reliable sources of drinking water for its more than 39 million residents. And it signals a shift in public opinion on a subject that as recently as two decades ago prompted backlash that scuttled similar projects.</p>
<p>Since then, California has been through multiple extreme droughts, including the most recent one that scientists say was the driest three-year period on record and left the state’s reservoirs at dangerously low levels.</p>
<p>“Water is so precious in California. It is important that we use it more than once,” said Jennifer West, managing director of WateReuse California, a group advocating for recycled water.</p>
<p>California has been using recycled wastewater for decades. The Ontario Reign minor league hockey team has used it to make ice for its rink in Southern California. Soda Springs Ski Resort near Lake Tahoe has used it to make snow. And farmers in the Central Valley, where much of the nation’s vegetables, fruits and nuts are grown, use it to water their crops.</p>
<p>But it hasn’t been used directly for drinking water. Orange County operates a large water purification system that recycles wastewater and then uses it to refill underground aquifers. The water mingles with the groundwater for months before being pumped up and used for drinking water again.</p>
<p>California’s new rules would let — but not require — water agencies take wastewater, treat it and then put it right back into the drinking water system. California would be just the second state to allow this, following Colorado.</p>
<p>It’s taken regulators more than 10 years to develop these rules, a process that included multiple reviews by independent panels of scientists. A state law required the California Water Resources Control Board to approve these regulations by December 31 — a deadline met with just days to spare.</p>
<p>The vote was heralded by some of the state’s biggest water agencies, which all have plans to build huge water recycling plants in the coming years. The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which serves 19 million people, aims to produce up to 570 million liters (150 million gallons) per day of both direct and indirect recycled water. A project in San Diego is aiming to account for nearly half of the city’s water by 2035.</p>
<p>Water agencies will need public support to complete these projects — which means convincing customers that not only is recycled water safe to drink, but it’s not icky.</p>
<p>California’s new rules require the wastewater to be treated for all pathogens and viruses, even if the pathogens and viruses aren’t in the wastewater. That’s different from regular water treatment rules, which require treatment only for known pathogens, said Darrin Polhemus, deputy director of the division of drinking water for the California Water Resources Control Board.</p>
<p>In fact, the treatment is so stringent it removes all of the minerals that make fresh drinking water taste good — meaning they have to be added back at the end of the process.</p>
<p>“It’s at the same drinking water quality, and probably better in many instances,” Polhemus said.</p>
<p>It’s expensive and time-consuming to build these treatment facilities, so Polhemus said it will only be an option for bigger, well-funded cities — at least initially.</p>
<p>In San Jose, local officials have opened the Silicon Valley Advanced Water Purification Center for public tours “so that people can see that this is a very high-tech process that ensures the water is super clean,” said Kirsten Struve, assistant officer for the water supply division at the Santa Clara Valley Water District.</p>
<p>Right now, the agency uses the water for things like irrigating parks and playing fields. But they plan to use it for drinking water in the future.</p>
<p>“We live in California where the drought happens all the time. And with climate change, it will only get worse,” Struve said. “And this is a drought-resistant supply that we will need in the future to meet the demands of our communities.”</p>
<p>Joaquin Esquivel, chair of the Water Resources Control Board that approved the new rules on Tuesday, noted that most people are already drinking recycled water anyway. Most wastewater treatment plants put their treated water back into rivers and streams, which then flow down to the next town so they can drink it.</p>
<p>“Anyone out there taking drinking water downstream from a wastewater treatment plant discharge — which, I promise you, you’re all doing — is already drinking toilet to tap,” Esquivel said. “All water is recycled. What we have here are standards, science and — importantly — monitoring that allow us to have the faith that it is pure water.”</p>

<p>The Marginalia Crawler has seen improvements! A long term problem with the crawler design is that if for whatever reason the crawler shuts down, then it needs to re-start fetching whatever domains it was currently traversing during the termination from zero. This isn’t fantastic, since not only does crawling a website take a fair bit of time, it’s a nuisance for the server admins to re-crawl stuff that was already fetched, and a real liability for ending up in robots.</p>

<p>date: 2023-12-20, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Objective
</title>
<p>
Intermittent energy restriction (IER) is an effective weight loss strategy. However, little is known about the dynamic effects of IER on the brain-gut-microbiome axis.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
In this study, a total of 25 obese individuals successfully lost weight after a 2-month IER intervention. FMRI was used to determine the activity of brain regions. Metagenomic sequencing was performed to identify differentially abundant gut microbes and pathways in from fecal samples.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Our results showed that IER longitudinally reduced the activity of obese-related brain regions at different timepoints, including the inferior frontal orbital gyrus in the cognitive control circuit, the putamen in the emotion and learning circuit, and the anterior cingulate cortex in the sensory circuit. IER longitudinally reduced <italic>E. coli</italic> abundance across multiple timepoints while elevating the abundance of obesity-related <italic>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Parabacteroides distasonis</italic>, and <italic>Bacterokles uniformis</italic>. Correlation analysis revealed longitudinally correlations between gut bacteria abundance alterations and brain activity changes.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusions
</title>
<p>
There was dynamical alteration of BGM axis (the communication of <italic>E. coli</italic> with specific brain regions) during the weight loss under the IER.

<h2 id="antibiotic-adjuvants-synergistic-tool-to-combat-multi-drug-resistant-pathogens">Antibiotic adjuvants: synergistic tool to combat multi-drug resistant pathogens</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-20, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<p>
The rise of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens poses a significant challenge to the field of infectious disease treatment. To overcome this problem, novel strategies are being explored to enhance the effectiveness of antibiotics. Antibiotic adjuvants have emerged as a promising approach to combat MDR pathogens by acting synergistically with antibiotics. This review focuses on the role of antibiotic adjuvants as a synergistic tool in the fight against MDR pathogens. Adjuvants refer to compounds or agents that enhance the activity of antibiotics, either by potentiating their effects or by targeting the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance. The utilization of antibiotic adjuvants offers several advantages. Firstly, they can restore the effectiveness of existing antibiotics against resistant strains. Adjuvants can inhibit the mechanisms that confer resistance, making the pathogens susceptible to the action of antibiotics. Secondly, adjuvants can enhance the activity of antibiotics by improving their penetration into bacterial cells, increasing their stability, or inhibiting efflux pumps that expel antibiotics from bacterial cells. Various types of antibiotic adjuvants have been investigated, including efflux pump inhibitors, resistance-modifying agents, and compounds that disrupt bacterial biofilms. These adjuvants can act synergistically with antibiotics, resulting in increased antibacterial activity and overcoming resistance mechanisms. In conclusion, antibiotic adjuvants have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of MDR pathogens. By enhancing the efficacy of antibiotics, adjuvants offer a promising strategy to combat the growing threat of antibiotic resistance. Further research and development in this field are crucial to harness the full potential of antibiotic adjuvants and bring them closer to clinical application.

<p>date: 2023-12-20, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<p>
Plant-parasitic nematodes are important economic pests of a range of tropical crops. Strategies for managing these pests have relied on a range of approaches, including crop rotation, the utilization of genetic resistance, cultural techniques, and since the 1950’s the use of nematicides. Although nematicides have been hugely successful in controlling nematodes, their toxicity to humans, domestic animals, beneficial organisms, and the environment has raised concerns regarding their use. Alternatives are therefore being sought. The <italic>Pasteuria</italic> group of bacteria that form endospores has generated much interest among companies wanting to develop microbial biocontrol products. A major challenge in developing these bacteria as biocontrol agents is their host-specificity; one population of the bacterium can attach to and infect one population of plant-parasitic nematode but not another of the same species. Here we will review the mechanism by which infection is initiated with the adhesion of endospores to the nematode cuticle. To understand the genetics of the molecular processes between <italic>Pasteuria</italic> endospores and the nematode cuticle, the review focuses on the nature of the bacterial adhesins and how they interact with the nematode cuticle receptors by exploiting new insights gained from studies of bacterial infections of <italic>Carnorhabditis elegans</italic>. A new <italic>Velcro-</italic>like multiple adhesin model is proposed in which the cuticle surface coat, which has an important role in endospore adhesion, is a complex extracellular matrix containing glycans originating in seam cells. The genes associated with these seam cells appear to have a dual role by retaining some characteristics of stem cells.

<h2 id="the-effects-of-nano-silver-loaded-zirconium-phosphate-on-antibacterial-properties-mechanical-properties-and-biosafety-of-room-temperature-curing-pmma-materials">The effects of nano-silver loaded zirconium phosphate on antibacterial properties, mechanical properties and biosafety of room temperature curing PMMA materials</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-20, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<p>
Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) frequently features in dental restorative materials due to its favorable properties. However, its surface exhibits a propensity for bacterial colonization, and the material can fracture under masticatory pressure. This study incorporated commercially available RHA-1F-II nano-silver loaded zirconium phosphate (Ag-ZrP) into room-temperature cured PMMA at varying mass fractions. Various methods were employed to characterize Ag-ZrP. Subsequently, an examination of the effects of Ag-ZrP on the antimicrobial properties, biosafety, and mechanical properties of PMMA materials was conducted. The results indicated that the antibacterial rate against Streptococcus mutans was enhanced at Ag-ZrP additions of 0%wt, 0.5%wt, 1.0%wt, 1.5%wt, 2.0%wt, 2.5%wt, and 3.0%wt, achieving respective rates of 53.53%, 67.08%, 83.23%, 93.38%, 95.85%, and 98.00%. Similarly, the antibacterial rate against Escherichia coli registered at 31.62%, 50.14%, 64.00%, 75.09%, 86.30%, 92.98%. When Ag-ZrP was introduced at amounts ranging from 1.0% to 1.5%, PMMA materials exhibited peak mechanical properties. However, mechanical strength diminished beyond additions of 2.5%wt to 3.0%wt, relative to the 0%wt group, while PMMA demonstrated no notable cytotoxicity below a 3.0%wt dosage. Thus, it is inferred that optimal antimicrobial and mechanical properties of PMMA materials are achieved with nano-Ag-ZrP (RHA-1F-II) additions of 1.5%wt to 2.0%wt, without eliciting cytotoxicity.

<p>date: 2023-12-20, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<p>
<italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (<italic>Lm</italic>) is associated with severe foodborne infections and ubiquitous in the nature. Identification of characteristics of <italic>Lm</italic> transmission through trading of food products is essential for rapidly tracking <italic>Lm</italic> sources and controlling dissemination of listeriosis. In this study, a total of 44 <italic>Lm</italic> strains were isolated from food products originating from 14 countries/regions during 2003-2018 at the Shanghai port. The genomes of these Lm strains were sequenced by high-throughput sequencing. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis showed that 43 isolates were divided into 17 sequence types (STs). The distribution of STs was decentralized, with the dominant ST2 accounting for only 18.18% of the strains. The LM63 strain did not match with any of the existing STs. Core-genome MLST (cgMLST) analysis based on 1748 core genes categorized the 44 strains into 30 cgMLST types (CTs), with CT10153 and CT7892 as the most predominant CTs. Notably, LM63 and LM67 shared the same CT in the cgMLST analysis. The phylogenetic analysis based on single-copy homologous genes revealed that the 44 <italic>Lm</italic> strains were primarily classified into two lineages. The SNP analysis also indicated that these strains were roughly divided into two clades, with strains in the first clade mainly collected earlier than those in the second clade, which were predominantly collected from 2010 onwards. The analysis using the virulence factor database (VFDB) indicated that the virulence gene <italic>inlJ</italic> was the most prevalent among these 44 strains. Notably, <italic>ddrA</italic>, <italic>msbA</italic>, and <italic>sugC</italic> were enriched in this dataset, requiring further clarification of their roles in <italic>Listeria</italic> through future studies. These results might provide a clue for understanding of the global epidemiology and surveillance of <italic>Lm</italic> and present insights for implementing effective measures to reduce or prevent <italic>Listeria</italic> contamination outbreaks in imported food products.
