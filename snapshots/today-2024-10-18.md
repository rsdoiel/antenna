## How to install Windows 11 on supported and unsupported PCs, 24H2 edition

date: 2024-10-17, from: OS News

We&#8217;ve pulled together all kinds of resources to create a comprehensive guide to installing and upgrading to Windows 11. This includes advice and some step-by-step instructions for turning on officially required features like your TPM and Secure Boot, as well as official and unofficial ways to skirt the system-requirement checks on &#8220;unsupported&#8221; PCs, because Microsoft is not your parent and therefore cannot tell you what to do. There are some changes in the 24H2 update that will keep you from running it on every ancient system that could run Windows 10, and there are new hardware requirements for some of the operating system&#8217;s new generative AI features. We&#8217;ve updated our guide with everything you need to know. ↫ Andrew Cunningham at Ars Technica In the before time, the things you needed to do to make Windows somewhat usable mostly came down to installing applications replicating features other operating systems had been enjoying for decades, but as time went on and Windows 10 came out, users now also had to deal with disabling a ton of telemetry, deleting preinstalled adware, dodge the various dark patterns around Edge, and more. You have wonder if it was all worth it, but alas, Windows 10 at least looked like Windows, if you squinted. With Windows 11, Microsoft really ramped up the steps users have to take to make it usable. There&#8217;s all of the above, but now you also have to deal with an ever-increasing number of ads, even more upsells and Edge dark patterns, even more data gathering, and the various hacks you have to employ to install it on perfectly fine and capable hardware. With Windows 10&#8217;s support ending next year, a lot of users are in a rough spot, since they can&#8217;t install Windows 11 without resorting to hacks, and they can&#8217;t keep using Windows 10 if they want to keep getting updates. And here comes 24H2, which makes it all even worse. Not only have various avenues to make Windows 11 installable on capable hardware been closed, it also piles on a whole bunch of &#8220;AI&#8221; garbage, and accompanying upsells and dark patterns, Windows users are going to have to deal with. Who doesn&#8217;t want Copilot regurgitating nonsense in their operating system&#8217;s search tool, or have Paint strongly suggest it will &#8220;improve&#8221; your quick doodle to illustrate something to a friend with that unique AI Style™ we all love and enjoy so much? Stay strong out there, Windows folks. Maybe it&#8217;ll get better. We&#8217;re rooting for you.

## The costs of the i386 to x86-64 upgrade

date: 2024-10-17, from: OS News

If you read my previous article on DOS memory models, you may have dismissed everything I wrote as “legacy cruft from the 1990s that nobody cares about any longer”. After all, computers have evolved from sporting 8-bit processors to 64-bit processors and, on the way, the amount of memory that these computers can leverage has grown orders of magnitude: the 8086, a 16-bit machine with a 20-bit address space, could only use 1MB of memory while today’s 64-bit machines can theoretically access 16EB. All of this growth has been in service of ever-growing programs. But… even if programs are now more sophisticated than they were before, do they all&#160;really&#160;require access to a 64-bit address space? Has the growth from 8 to 64 bits been a net positive in performance terms? Let’s try to answer those questions to find some very surprising answers. But first, some theory. ↫ Julio Merino It&#8217;s not quite weekend yet, but I&#8217;m still calling this some light reading for the weekend.

## ToothFairy 2.8.5

date: 2024-10-17, from: Michael Tsai

ToothFairy 2.8.5 is a maintenance update of my Bluetooth menu bar utility. It fixes a bug where sometimes ToothFairy wouldn&#8217;t auto-launch at login. An interesting bug was: ToothFairy uses SMLoginItemSetEnabled(), which, instead of launching the app directly, launches a helper app that can launch the main app. Originally, it did this using NSWorkspace.launchApplication(_:), but then [&#8230;]

## Android 15’s security and privacy features are the update’s highlight

date: 2024-10-17, from: OS News

Android 15 started rolling out to Pixel devices Tuesday and will arrive, through various third-party efforts, on other Android devices at some point. There is always a bunch of little changes to discover in an Android release, whether by reading, poking around, or letting your phone show you 25 new things after it restarts. In Android 15, some of the most notable involve making your device less appealing to snoops and thieves and more secure against the kids to whom you hand your phone to keep them quiet at dinner. There are also smart fixes for screen sharing, OTP codes, and cellular hacking prevention, but details about them are spread across Google&#8217;s own docs and blogs and various news site&#8217;s reports. ↫ Kevin Purdy at Ars Technica It&#8217;s a welcome collection of changes and features to better align Android&#8217; theft and personal privacy protection with how thieves steal phones in this day and age. I&#8217;m not sure I understand all of them, though &#8211; the Private Space, where you can drop applications to lock them behind an additional pin code, confuses me, since everyone can see it&#8217;s there. I assumed Private Space would also give people in vulnerable positions &#8211; victims of abuse, journalists, dissidents, etc. &#8211; the option to truly hide parts of their life to protect their safety, but it doesn&#8217;t seem to work that way. Android 15 will also use &#8220;AI&#8221; to recognise when a device is yanked out of your hands and lock it instantly, which is a great use case for &#8220;AI&#8221; that actually benefits people. Of course, it will be even more useful once thieves are aware this feature exists, so that they won&#8217;t even try to steal your phone in the first place, but since this is Android, it&#8217;ll be a while before Android 15 makes its way to enough users for it to matter.

## Seattle Xcoders 20th Anniversary Meetup

date: 2024-10-17, from: Innessential (Brint Simmons' blog)

<p>This Thursday, Oct. 17, 2024, is the 20th anniversary of the Seattle Xcoders! We’d love to see you there, at 7 pm at <a href="https://www.bbycballard.com/">Bale Breaker and Yonder Cider taproom</a> in Ballard.</p>

<p>Everyone is welcome! It’s not just for people who write code — it’s for designers, testers, support folks, and everyone who helps make Apple-ecosystem apps. Even if you just <em>like</em> those kinds of apps and like talking about them, come join us!</p>

<p>We’re usually outside by these propane fire things, but I’m not sure this time — we might have a room or some area or something. We should be easy to find, at any rate.</p>

<p>It’s not actually a meeting with presentations — it’s just hanging out and talking. Which we do every first, third, and fifth Thursday (you can <a href="webcal://p25-caldav.icloud.com/published/2/Nzc2ODExNzg3NzY4MTE3OA8zb_qUej-fZsXG-_oJak3bJvjP8RcHmIEZ0WxGu2kWkvciKC5Sm6Xm5sHZRUHdZPM3KQg8-b2iwsMIEOTWlJo">subscribe to our calendar</a>). One of these days we’ll get back to presentations — but the social part is valuable, and so we keep it up.</p>

<p>PS Looks like the food truck is Impeckable Chicken, which I’ve heard good things about. :)</p>

<p>PPS I’m usually easy to spot: quite well into middle age, with nothing like the amount of hair I once had. Black jeans, usually a black sweatshirt. Glasses. Doc Martens. Not tall.</p>

## Centering a div in a div in 2020

date: 2024-10-17, from: Lean Rada's blog


<p>tl;dr: use <code>place-content: center</code> on a <code>grid</code> container.</p>

  <span>display</span><span>:</span> grid<span>;</span>
  <span>place-content</span><span>:</span> center<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

<p>Here’s how that looks like:</p>
div child
<p>That’s it. Two CSS rules.</p>

<p>Yes, four years late according to <em>caniuse</em>. But this is apparently still not well-known today.</p>

<p>Based on <a target="_blank" href="https://build-your-own.org/blog/20240813_css_vertical_center/">recent developments<span>🡵</span></a>, looks like we just need a few more years
              before we can finally get rid of the extra <code>display</code> rule so we can have the one CSS rule to center them all.
