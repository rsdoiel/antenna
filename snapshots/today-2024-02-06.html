<li>California storm causes $11 billion in damage

<p>
The storm that dropped huge amounts of rain on Southern California
Sunday and Monday caused at least $11 billion in damages and economic
losses, according to Accuweather. Dangerous winds, flooding, and
landslides pummeled the region, hitting Los Angeles and its surrounding
neighborhoods particularly hard. The University of California at Los
Angeles recorded an incredible 12 inches of rain over 24 hours.
Landslides swept through high-income communities including Beverly
Hills, burying cars and forcing residents to evacuate.

suggests the planet has already warmed by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius
above preindustrial levels. In fact, the researchers say humans have
raised the global temperature by 1.7 degrees Celsius, or about 3.1
degrees Fahrenheit. Much of the scientific community puts current
warming at about 1.2 degrees Celsius, so this new calculation has
climate experts in a tizzy.<br/><br/>The research hinges on observations
from six sea sponges in the Caribbean Sea. These sponges are very old,
and their skeletons contain what <em>The New York Times</em>

“chemical fingerprints” of the ocean temperatures going back to 1700,
long before we started measuring in the 1850s. The findings suggest
global warming began about 40 years earlier than previously thought,
which means the preindustrial base line level to which we compare
temperatures today is flawed. The authors say current warming is half a
degree Celsius higher than the most common estimates.<br/><br/>Not
everyone agrees. Some critics say data from a single location should not
upend global temperature assessments. Others slam the authors for
confusing the public. “It is the date of the reference period that
matters rather than whether it is labelled pre-industrial or not,”

<li>EU reportedly backs down on farming emissions cuts
</h3>
<p>
Farmers across the European Union have been protesting for weeks against
a plan to curb greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector,
and it looks like their efforts paid off: A new plan for cutting the
bloc’s emissions by 90% by 2040, set to be unveiled today, nixes the
call for a 30% reduction in gases like methane and nitrogen, which are
linked to farming, the <em>Financial Times

The conflict stems from farmers’ concerns that policymakers are ignoring
them, and with European Parliament elections just a few months away,
center-right politicians are trying to win over every vote they can. But
there will be consequences: The agricultural sector is projected to be
“the biggest emitter by 2040 unless the EU takes action,”

The uproar demonstrates the challenges politicians face in rolling out
new green policies without losing support from key demographics.

<p>Apple has rolled out an update to its operating system this week with
a feature called Stolen Device Protection. It makes it a lot harder for
phone thieves to access key functions and settings, and users are being
urged to turn it on immediately. The software update for iPhones and

exploited: allowing them to lock victims out of their Apple accounts,
delete their photos and other files from their iCloud accounts and empty
their bank accounts by accessing passwords kept in the Keychain password
manager.</p>

with some help from the U.S. government. However, Save the Children says
one-third of those displaced by the disaster are still homeless.

released the text of the national security supplemental bill on which a
bipartisan team of negotiators has been working for four months.
Negotiators were working on adding a border component to an urgent
measure to fund aid to Ukraine, Israel, and Gaza, since extremist House
Republicans said they would not pass such a measure until Congress also
addressed what they insisted was a crisis at the U.S. border.</p>

<h2 id="coraquest">CoraQuest</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-06, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kjwjyRAxGGw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
<p>
<a href="https://www.coraquest.com/">CoraQuest</a> is a “family
cooperative dungeon crawler” created by adorable dad-daughter duo Dan
and Cora Hughes from Huddersfield, UK. Feeling the boredom of pandemic
lockdown, Dan and Cora (8yo) decided to design a board game and
<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cabbagedan/coraquest/description">put
it on Kickstarter</a>. I’ve wanted an easy “Dungeons and Dragons for
Kids” game for a long time and this hits all the marks. It’s
imaginative, tactile, visual, and it has
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzLi8IWmLKU">a simple
ruleset</a> that kids can easily grok. I backed it the minute I saw it.
</p>
<p>
CoraQuest comes with ~9 or so premade adventures so parents can run a
one-shot without much preparation. The dungeon is a stack of 9x9 tiles
with special story cards mixed in that map to story beats in the premade
adventure. I embellish a bit and give the bad guys names like “Gerald”
and “Geoffrey”. Add some funny voices and it’s a guaranteed good time
for kids. My son and his friends played for two hours the other day and
the kids didn’t even think about devices. That is worth the price of
admission alone.
</p>
<p>
There’s other aspects that make this game great like how you can upload
drawings to <a href="https://www.coraquest.com/cc/creator.html">design
your own heroes and enemies</a>, there’s
<a href="https://www.coraquest.com/hoodez-hidden-door/">narrated
quests</a> to offload that responsibility, but to me the best part is my
kids love it and ask for it. The infectious laughter of Dan and Cora has
infected our house and young Cora is a role model that I often point to
and tell my kids they can make a cool game everyone loves if you set
your mind to it. I love the game so much I’ve
<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cabbagedan/coraquest-keep-on-questing-expansion/description">bought
the expansion</a> as well as a
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CK9WNG57">short story book</a> that
takes place in the CoraQuest fantasy universe.
</p>
<p>
If you’re looking for a game to play with your kids and their friends, I
highly recommend CoraQuest.

1.22.1, 1.21.3 and 1.20.6 Released!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-06, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
The <strong>CloudNativePG Community</strong> The CloudNativePG Community
is excited to announce a new update for the *<em>CloudNativePG
Operator</em>, now available for the supported 1.22, 1.21, and 1.20
versions.
</p>
<p>
Key enhancements in all supported minor releases are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Customize ephemeral volume storage for a PostgreSQL cluster using a
claim template
</li>
<li>
Introduce the <code>pgadmin4</code> command in the <code>cnpg</code>
plugin for <code>kubectl</code> to swiftly set up a demonstration-only
interface for PgAdmin4. This is the most popular GUI for PostgreSQL,
facilitating easy connection to a designated Postgres Cluster
</li>
<li>
Add support for PostgreSQL’s ident map file configuration
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Versions 1.22.1, 1.21.3 and 1.20.6</strong> are <em>patch
releases</em> that include essential bug fixes, addressing issues such
as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Prevention of an unrecoverable problem with <code>pg_rewind</code>
caused by <code>postgresql.auto.conf</code> being read-only due to the
disabled alter system option
</li>
<li>
Reduction of the risk of disk space shortage when using the import
facility of the <code>initdb</code> bootstrap method
</li>
</ul>
<p>
With this update, version 1.20 has reached End-of-Life (EOL). Version
1.20.6 marks the final release for the 1.20 minor version.
</p>
<p>
We highly recommend updating the operator at your earliest convenience
to benefit from these improvements and bug fixes.
</p>
<p>

<h1>
About CloudNativePg
</h1>
<p>
<a href="https://cloudnative-pg.io">CloudNativePG</a> is an open source
Kubernetes Operator for PostgreSQL workloads that orchestrates the full
life cycle of a PostgreSQL cluster, from bootstrapping and
configuration, through high availability and connection routing, to
backups and disaster recovery. CloudNativePG relies on PostgreSQL’s
native streaming replication to distribute data across pods, nodes, and
zones, using standard Kubernetes patterns. Replicas can be scaled up and
down in a Kubernetes native manner, and the operator automatically and
safely reconfigure replication as appropriate.

id="opposition-to-senate-border-bill-jeopardizes-help-for-afghans-who-aided-us-troops">Opposition
to Senate Border Bill Jeopardizes Help for Afghans Who Aided US
Troops</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The massive $118 billion Senate border bill not only
contains once-in-a-decade border security legislation and wartime aid to
Israel and Ukraine, but also offers a chance for the U.S. to keep its
promise to Afghans who worked alongside U.S. soldiers in America’s
longest war. </p>
<p>Tucked inside the sprawling package is a measure that would provide a
long-awaited pathway to residency for tens of thousands of Afghan
refugees who arrived in the U.S. on military planes after the chaotic
withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021. </p>
<p>But the measure may fail if members can’t agree on the bill’s larger,
unrelated provisions. Democrats, especially members of the Congressional
Hispanic Caucus, have voiced opposition for what they call the extreme,
far-right border policies in the legislation that they say do nothing to
help fix the country’s broken immigration system. </p>
<p>Conservatives have said the package does not go far enough in
limiting the number of daily migrant crossings at the southern
border. </p>
<p>If it fails, it will represent yet another disappointment for the
more than 76,000 Afghans currently living in the U.S. who remain in
immigration limbo as a result of years of congressional inaction. </p>
<p>A small group of bipartisan lawmakers and advocacy groups have worked
for nearly three years to get a House or Senate vote on a standalone
bill, the Afghan Adjustment Act, that would prevent Afghans from
becoming stranded without legal residency status when their humanitarian
parole expires. But advocates have repeatedly faced strong opposition
from some Republican lawmakers to vetting requirements for the refugees
who were brought here and their family members still stranded in
Kabul. </p>
<p>The bipartisan border deal offered a long-awaited breakthrough. Both
Republican and Democratic senators and their staff worked to bridge the
divide and produce legislative text that both sides could support. The
new proposal would couple measures enabling qualified Afghans to
eventually apply for U.S. citizenship, as was done for refugees in the
past, including those from Cuba, Vietnam and Iraq, with stricter and
more expedited vetting processes. </p>
<p>“I think the most gracious thing would be to say there’s been a lot
of twists and turns, but I’m very happy with the result,” Democratic
Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, one of the lead sponsors of the effort,
told The Associated Press on Monday. “And I’m very glad that it’s
included because this is an important signal that the United States
stands by those who stand by us.” </p>
<p>The U.S. government admitted the refugees on a temporary parole
status as part of Operation Allies Welcome, the largest resettlement
effort in the country in decades, with the promise of a pathway to life
in the U.S. for their service. </p>
<p>“Our position is that Afghans stood by us for 20 years and over the
past three years, they’ve been asked to take a backseat to every other
bill,” said Shawn VanDiver, a Navy veteran and head of #AfghanEvac, a
coalition supporting Afghan resettlement efforts. “And so it is really
nice to see that they’re included in this one.” </p>
<p>But hopes for fulfilling that promise to longtime allies of America’s
mission in Kabul could be short-lived. Republican leaders in the House
have declared the bill a non-starter, and even passage through the
Senate, where the deal was negotiated, is an uphill climb. </p>
<p>As proponents of the Afghan provision await the fate of the package,
they are trying to remain cautiously optimistic that their campaign is
making headway. </p>
<p>VanDiver, who has worked with the State Department on this issue
since the U.S. withdrawal, said he has heard a lot of excitement from
Afghan allies and their family members in the last 12 hours about the
inclusion in the package. </p>
<p>“The worst part about it is that it is now on us to manage
expectations,” he said. “These folks have already been through so much
and it’s frankly embarrassing that we can’t figure out how to give them
the permanency that they’ve earned.”</p>

AmigaDOS</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>In keeping with the Commodore tradition of cost cutting, most
consumer models of their Amiga line of computers came with severely
watered down documentation. The Amiga 500 was an exception from this
rule, but owners of later machines – such as the A1200 – may not have
gotten any documentation for the command line part of AmigaOS at all.
And, of course, even if this documentation had shipped with the
machines, it wouldn’t have revealed features that were hidden to anyone
without access to official developer documentation or even left
completely undocumented or unfinished. This is a quick look at a few of
these interesting features, some more obscure than others, but all of
them decidedly useful. Most of them only apply to versions 2.x and/or
3.x of the OS. With that said, let’s dive right in! ↫ Carl Svensson

<h2 id="microsoft-sneaks-ads-into-the-new-outlook-for-windows">Microsoft
sneaks ads into the new Outlook for Windows</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>The migration from the classic Mail and Calendar app to the new
Outlook app is in full swing already. Microsoft announced the
deprecation of the classic apps in favor of a new Outlook app in June
2023. It introduced the new Outlook app to Insider builds a month later
and announced that it would enforce the migration in early 2024. Not all
users are migrated at this point. Those who have been migrated already
or installed the Outlook app directly, may notice several differences
between the new Outlook app and the classic Mail app. One of the main
differences turns an ad-free email experience into one with ads. You may
see ads in the inbox in the new Outlook. ↫ Martin Brinkmann Ads
disguised as emails in your inbox. Microsoft will not rest until Windows
resembles Times Square. What a trash fire of an operating system.</p>

id="us-to-impose-visa-limits-on-spyware-abusers-targeting-journalists-activists">US
to Impose Visa Limits on Spyware Abusers Targeting Journalists,
Activists</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Biden administration announced Monday it is rolling
out a new policy that will allow it to impose visa restrictions on
foreign individuals involved in the misuse of commercial spyware.</p>
<p>The administration’s policy will apply to people who’ve been involved
in the misuse of commercial spyware to target individuals including
journalists, activists, perceived dissidents, members of marginalized
communities, or the family members of those who are targeted. The visa
restrictions could also apply to people who facilitate or get financial
benefit from the misuse of commercial spyware, officials said.</p>
<p>“The United States remains concerned with the growing misuse of
commercial spyware around the world to facilitate repression, restrict
the free flow of information, and enable human rights abuses,” Secretary
of State Antony Blinken said in a statement</p>
<p>announcing the new policy. “The misuse of commercial spyware
threatens privacy and freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, and
association. Such targeting has been linked to arbitrary detentions,
forced disappearances, and extrajudicial killings in the most egregious
of cases.”</p>
<p>Biden issued an executive order nearly a year ago restricting the
U.S. government’s use of commercial spyware “that poses risks to
national security.”</p>
<p>That order required the head of any U.S. agency using commercial
programs to certify that they don’t pose a significant
counterintelligence or other security risk, a senior administration
official said. It was issued as the White House acknowledged a surge in
hacks of U.S. government employees, across 10 countries, that had been
compromised or targeted by commercial spyware.</p>
<p>A senior administration official who briefed reporters ahead of
Monday’s announcement would not say if any particular individuals were
in line to immediately be impacted by the visa restrictions. The
official spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by
the White House.</p>
<p>Officials said the visa restriction policy can apply to citizens of
any country found to have misused or facilitated the malign use of
spyware, even if they are from countries whose citizens are allowed
entry into the U.S. without first applying for a visa.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best-known example of spyware, the Pegasus software from
Israel’s NSO Group, was used to target more than 1,000 people across 50
countries, according to security researchers and a July 2021 global
media investigation, citing a list of more than 50,000 cellphone
numbers.</p>
<p>The U.S. has already placed export limits on NSO Group, restricting
the company’s access to U.S. components and technology.</p>
<p>Pegasus spyware was used in Jordan to hack the cellphones of at least
30 people, including journalists, lawyers, human rights and political
activists, the digital rights group Access Now announced last week.</p>
<p>The hacking with spyware made by Israel’s NSO Group occurred from
2019 until last September, according to Access Now. It did not accuse
Jordan’s government of the hacking.</p>
<p>Amnesty International also reported that its forensic researchers had
determined that Pegasus spyware was installed on the phone of The
Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s fiancée, Hatice Cengiz,
just four days after he was killed in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in
2018. The company had previously been implicated in other spying on
Khashoggi.</p>

<h2 id="iran-backed-militias-resume-attacks-on-us-positions">Iran-Backed
Militias Resume Attacks on US Positions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Pentagon — Iran-backed militias in Syria are again targeting the
United States and its allies, launching at least three attacks on
American positions following a U.S. bombardment aimed at disrupting the
ability of the militias to pose a threat.</p>
<p>U.S. military officials told VOA the most recent attack came early
Monday, when a single rocket was lobbed at U.S. and coalition forces at
the Mission Support Site Euphrates base in eastern Syria. </p>
<p>The official said there were no injuries or damage as a result of the
attack.</p>
<p>But an earlier attack, targeting the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic
Forces on Sunday, did hit its mark. The official said a one-way attack
drone hit the base at the Omar Oil Field, near Deir el-Zour, causing
multiple SDF casualties. </p>
<p>SDF spokesman Farhad Shami said on social media that the drone attack
killed six SDF fighters. </p>
<p>The SDF base is located near the U.S. position known as Green
Village.</p>
<p>The U.S. also confirmed an attack by Iran-backed militias on Friday,
when multiple rockets targeted Mission Support Site Euphrates base. No
injuries or damage were reported.</p>
<p>The three latest attacks are the first since the U.S. unleashed a
series of airstrikes that hit 85 targets at seven locations in Iraq and
Syria late Friday, dropping more than 125 precision munitions in about
half-an-hour.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have said Friday’s strikes were aimed at disrupting
the militia’s logistical capabilities by striking targets “critical to
their supply chain,” including command-and-control centers, drone and
missile storage sites, and other key facilities.</p>
<p>Washington has also warned more strikes are coming.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden “will do what he thinks needs to be done,”
White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN’s “State of
the Union” Sunday, refusing to rule out strikes inside Iran itself.</p>
<p>“There will be additional action that we will take — all designed to
put an end to these attacks,” White House National Security Council
spokesperson, John Kirby, told reporters following Friday’s strikes.</p>
<p>Iranian officials have condemned the U.S. strikes, calling them a
violation of Syrian and Iraqi sovereignty. Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesperson Nasser Kanaani further described the U.S. strikes as “a
serious strategic mistake.”</p>
<p>U.S. officials, so far, have declined to share estimates on how many
militias members were killed in Friday’s strikes, but Syrian opposition
activists said at least 29 fighters were killed in Syria while Iraqi
officials said at least 16 militia members were killed with another 36
wounded.</p>
<p>The renewed attacks by Iran-backed militias in Syria come as
Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen continue to threaten international
shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, despite a new wave of
airstrikes Saturday by an international coalition led by the U.S. and
Britain.</p>
<p>The U.S. military said it carried out a “self-defense” strike late
Sunday against cruise missiles in an area of Yemen controlled by Houthi
militants. </p>
<p>U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), which oversees U.S. forces in the
region, said the strike hit four anti-ship missiles that were being
readied to launch at ships in the Red Sea.</p>
<p>CENTCOM said it also carried out self-defense strikes against a
Houthi land attack cruise missile in a separate incident on Sunday.</p>
<p>Sunday’s preemptive strikes come after the U.S. and Britain hit at
least 36 Houthi targets in Yemen on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Houthis, though, said they will not be backing down.</p>
<p>“Military operations against Israel will continue until the crimes of
genocide in Gaza are stopped and the siege on its residents is lifted,
no matter the sacrifices it costs us,” Mohammed al-Bukhaiti, a Houthi
official, wrote on X. “American-British aggression against Yemen will
not go unanswered, and we will meet escalation with escalation.”    </p>
<p>Still, the White House has defended its approach to both the militias
in Iraq and Syria and Yemen’s Houthis, recently designated as a terror
group.</p>
<p>“Each attack we undertake helps degrade capabilities” of the
Iranian-backed militias in the region, the White House’s Sullivan said
Sunday. “The U.S. will step up when it’s attacked,” but at the same time
make sure the U.S. is “not pulled into a war in the Middle East. We will
defend our troops.”</p>

<p>Nick Lockwood: I once again got bitten by the fact that T? properties
in a Swift struct become optional parameters in the synthesized
initializer, making it easy to accidentally omit a property that you
meant to set. The workaround is either to use let instead of var, or to
use Optional&lt;T&gt; instead of T? Swift […]</p>

<h2 id="a-holy-communion">A holy communion</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-05, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
You and I are partaking in something magical.
</p>
<p>
The electric meat inside my cranium told my fingers to punch mechanical
keys to send signals through an electric rock and encode these thoughts
on a magnetic rock. Then through radio waves, beacons, and wires I
create a copy of this magnetically encoded text on another rock in
another town, in another state. That rock copies itself to another town
(possibly in another country) closer to you. Then through another relay
of wires and radio waves that text replicates itself on the electric
rock in your palm. Your rock renders those words with light through
stained glass. You read rendered words and glyphs and the electric meat
in your own head decodes the text.
</p>
<p>
Our thoughts, words, and images transfigured through time and space as
ones and zeroes. Circumnavigating the globe in milliseconds. An
immaculate relay. A holy exchange.
</p>
<p>
That is powerful. It is precious. We would do well to preserve its
sanctity.

Google Maps Is (Subtly!) Trying to Persuade You to Make Better
Choices</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-05, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTM2MTE5MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NjQwODE4MH0.FEUtF_fCkDlUe04vkfX8nO2MV5778ZoAm2-jt7JP0u4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
While browsing Google Flights for an escape from the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/warm-winters-mental-health-depression" target="_self">winter
doldrums</a>, I recently encountered a notification I hadn’t seen
before. One particular return flight from Phoenix to New York was
highlighted in light green as avoiding “as much CO2 as 1,400 trees
absorb a day.”
</p>
<p>
I’d seen Google Flights’ emissions estimates before, of course — they’ve
been around since 2021 — but this was the
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/9/23825771/google-american-airlines-ai-flights-contrails-climate-change" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first
time</a> I’d seen it translate a number like “265 kg CO2e” into
something I could actually understand. Suddenly, <em>not</em> picking
the flight felt like it would have made me, well, kind of bad.
</p>
<p>
Yael Maguire, the vice president and general manager of the
sustainability team at Google Geo — which includes Maps, Earth, and
<a href="https://sunroof.withgoogle.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Project
Sunroof</a>, the company’s solar calculator — stressed that Google isn’t
trying to take people’s agency away with these kinds of light-green
guilt trips. “We want to make the sustainable choice the easy choice,”
he told me, in reference to a slew of new tools the company has been
rolling out, from fuel-efficient routing in Maps (which Google
<a href="https://youtu.be/yv_C-0E2yL0?feature=shared&t=1003" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimates</a>
has eliminated the emissions equivalent of 500,000 internal combustion
cars from the road since 2021), to suggesting train routes to
flight-shoppers, to nudging Europeans to ditch their cars when public
transportation could get them to their destinations in a comparable
amount of time.
</p>
<p>
Last week, I spoke to Maguire about the sustainability projects at
Google Geo, including the team’s
<a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/solar/overview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Solar
API</a>, which provides solar-planning data for millions of buildings
worldwide. Our conversation has been lightly condensed for clarity and
brevity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Do you see your job at Google Geo as passively presenting
sustainability information to users, or do you see it as actively
nudging people toward making better choices for the planet?</strong>
</p>
<p>
We’re not trying to take agency away from anybody. We want to make sure
— whether you’re a consumer choosing an eco-friendly route, or you’re a
developer who’s thinking about trying to build more sustainably, or
you’re a solar developer who wants to help with that — we want the
choices to be in their hands. But we want to make it the easiest choice
possible because, while it’s ultimately their decision, it will lead to
carbon reductions over time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>That’s the idea behind fuel efficiency suggestions in Google
Maps, where a route is prominently displayed with the little leaf,
right?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Exactly. We launched a capability in Google Earth last year to help real
estate developers do high-level planning and building development to
make the sustainable choice the easy choice. As they’re saying, “We’re
trying to get this many units with these kinds of amenities, etc.,
etc.,” we give them the tools to optimize for all the things they want
to optimize for. But we can also say, “Hey, if you also care about
sustainability, you can use different materials, we can get more
sunlight in the area, and you have this much potential for solar.” And
that just comes bundled with the tool itself.
</p>
<p>
We always try to find the co-benefits. I know for me personally, I
always try to make the sustainable choice as much as I can. But I know
that other people may not be as motivated by that, and having those
co-benefits — like, it saves money, or it saves time, or it saves fuel,
whatever it might be. We want to try to bring those together as much as
possible.
</p>
<p>
<strong>When I was in Tbilisi, Georgia, a few months ago, I was using
the ride-share app Bolt, and
<a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/bolt-adds-zero-emission-no-cost-travel-option-walking" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at
the time</a> it had a feature where if you tried to book a car to a
location less than a 15-minute walk away, it would suggest you walk
instead. I saw in a
<a href="https://youtu.be/yv_C-0E2yL0?feature=shared" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a>
from Google’s sustainability summit last fall that you’re rolling out
something similar in some locations in Europe — France was one. Do you
find these sorts of rollouts in the U.S. are stymied at all by how
un-walkable most American cities are?</strong>
</p>
<p>
We are trying to make the most of cities as they are. They’re hard to
change. But one of the things I find really encouraging is there’s
definitely a long timeframe for this. Mayors and the folks in their
departments of transportation recognize that they have to make more
options available for people to commute and move around. They’re not
necessarily going to be able to change things overnight. But there are
major changes that are happening — for example, in the city of London,
we were able to announce
<a href="https://pagely.traffictechnologytoday.com/news/safety/transport-for-london-and%E2%80%AFgoogle%E2%80%AFmaps-collaborate-to-make-cycling-safer-in-cities.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hundreds
of miles of new bike lanes</a>. So a lot of changes are happening over a
relatively short amount of time, too.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes it’s hard to know what is going to be the impact of those
decisions, though. And so, again, with these tools, city planners have
the opportunity to scenario plan and say, “Okay, we’re thinking of
trying to put bike lanes in this corridor in the city, what is going to
be the impact on carbon?”
</p>
<p>
<strong>I wanted to ask a similar question in the context of a new
feature that suggests train routes to Europeans looking for short-haul
flights. How is Google thinking about promoting low-emissions
transportation options like trains to Americans, eventually, when our
infrastructure often isn’t there yet? Is this a challenge you talk about
internally?</strong>
</p>
<p>
It is definitely something that is top of mind. But I do think even in
the U.S., there are times when taking a train is actually faster. There
are actually a lot of instances where walking, cycling, and public
transportation are the most effective ways to get somewhere — and that’s
not even considering the cost side of it, which is also something people
might want to consider. I’m actually fairly optimistic — when I worked
in San Francisco, I took public transportation, and I tried to walk as
much as I can in all the cities that I’ve lived in, so I feel like I
have lived experience in what the reality [in the U.S.] is. And some of
these alternative options can be very effective. There’s more work to
do, though, to make sure that we’re doing this globally.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Arguably, Google Maps could have a significant role to play in
the success of the larger EV transition in terms of making charging
stations and trip planning easy and handy for drivers. I’ve been working
on planning my first EV road trip this summer and have been pretty
intimidated, to be honest. Can you tell me what is in Google’s pipeline
to help make this process easier for drivers?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I can’t talk about things that haven’t been announced yet, but I will
say that, just as an overarching goal, we want to make that as easy as
possible. I’m an EV owner, I have been for a number of years, and I know
sometimes it can be a cognitive task to think about, “How am I going to
charge and what is that experience going to be like?” So I would just
say that we are really aware and trying to deeply understand the problem
as much as possible, and our goal is to really address it.
</p>
<p>
Even when someone is thinking about purchasing a car, oftentimes people
go to Google Search to look for vehicles, and we can help people
understand what the potential is of a particular vehicle they’re
considering. What typically concerns people is a long-distance trip. So
we’ve made a
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/wheels/news/news-google-search-ev-shopping/#:~:text=Battery%20Range%20Explorer,and%20the%20fuel%20efficiency%2C%20MPGe." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tool</a>
where you can plug in a familiar destination — like for me, I live in
San Francisco, it might be going to Tahoe— and for a given car you can
see how many charges would you have to do on the way. Being able to make
that info a little bit easier for people to see before they even buy the
car is a thing that we’ve tried to do.
</p>
<p>
We’re also trying to make charging experiences as positive as possible.
The first thing is, honestly, just getting as many chargers on the map
as possible. There are a number of different providers who have charging
infrastructure and sometimes all the data isn’t widely available so
we’ve tried really, really hard to work with those partners. We have
information on, I believe, 360,000 chargers worldwide and we’re
constantly trying to grow that. On top of that — and I hope you don’t
experience this — but not all the chargers work. You’ve probably seen on
Google Maps, there are reviews, right? So there’s all kinds of work
happening there.
</p>
<p>
My EV doesn’t have Google Maps integrated, unfortunately, but I’m really
looking forward to one day having this feature where I can search for a
charger along the route. We’d like to get to that point where you don’t
actually have to do all this planning in advance and you can just get in
your car and plan along the way like you would if it was another type of
vehicle.
</p>
<p>
<strong>It’s one thing to have a tool like the
<a href="https://insights.sustainability.google/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google
Tree Canopy</a> available for cities and organizers, and it’s another
thing for people to actually use that tool and act on the information.
How are you measuring your success?</strong>
</p>
<p>
We measure our success ultimately by what people do with our tools. So
it’s not just about putting the tool out there. We actually try to
understand what people are doing. In the case of what we did with
eco-friendly routing, we worked with the
<a href="https://www.nrel.gov/news/features/2023/nrel-innovations-help-consumers-invest-in-our-planet.html#:~:text=To%20help%20travelers%20decide%20on,that%20rolled%20out%20in%202022." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National
Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> in the U.S., for example, to help
validate our carbon emissions model. We’re going through that process
for everything we do, whether it’s Project Sunroof or the Solar API, or
other things like that.
</p>
<p>
<strong>You preempted my next question, but maybe you can talk about it
in a more macro sense — Google has the
<a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/google-maps-apis-environment-sustainability/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">goal</a>
of “collectively reducing 1 gigaton of carbon equivalent emissions
annually by 2030” with tools like Solar API. Can you give me any sort of
progress update?</strong>
</p>
<p>
This is a project that’s been going on for some time. We’ve been working
with solar developers for a while, but we’ve been pleasantly surprised
not only by the solar developer community engagement, but there’s
actually other industries that have shown interest. So
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/customers/myheat" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MyHEAT</a>
— they’re not a typical solar installer, but they’re finding this data
really useful to go to cities and help them with the plans that they
have.
</p>
<p>
So the gigaton goal itself, there is nothing to share now other than the
progress on eco-friendly routing, but it is something that we hope we’ll
be able to share progress on over time. But so far, we’re quite happy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>At a time when there’s a lot of nervousness around AI — and
often for good reason — you’ve been pretty vocal in your excitement
about how such tools can be used for the positive purposes of
sustainability. Tell me why you’re an optimist.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Here’s why I’m an optimist: Because it’s where I put all of Google’s
public goals in context. We talked about the gigaton goal, we talked
about the Solar API — but I think this is also a question about energy
usage and carbon intensity. We will continue to invest in the
infrastructure that we need — and we need that infrastructure to be able
to actually help solve some of these problems, by providing information
to people — but at the same time, the company has been really focused on
trying to minimize the carbon intensity of the energy we produce. So,
since 2017, we’ve been operating off of 100% renewable energy; this is
on an annualized basis. We also have an initiative to use carbon-free
energy — so the source of the energy that ultimately goes where
electrons are going to our data centers, we’re actively measuring what
percentage of that is carbon-free on a 24/7 basis.
</p>
<p>
With our net-zero commitments, to be on a net basis by 2030, that
includes all of our AI infrastructure. That’s where I would try to
separate the energy use that’s required to operate AI from the carbon
intensity, which I think is very different. Our data centers, we
estimate, are one-and-a-half times more efficient than your average data
center. And with AI workloads themselves, in some instances, we’ve been
able to get the energy usage down by 100x, and the corresponding amount
of carbon intensity down by 1,000x.
</p>
<p>
But to your point, at the same time, it is very much on our minds that
the carbon intensity to run all of these AI workloads — how does that
compare to the benefits that they’re able to provide? I think that’s
where I am. I do have a lot of optimism about the efficiency work, about
the trajectory of carbon-free energy and net zero. The upsides in terms
of what it does for solar, what it does for transportation — yeah, I am
a big believer.
</p>
<p>
The big reason why I’m so excited about this opportunity in the Maps and
Geo space is I just think there’s so much opportunity for all kinds of
organizations, including individual citizens, to make these choices and
changes to their environment. And I think the role that AI has is
enormous — obviously not the whole thing, because it doesn’t build
cycling lanes. People have to go do that. People have to change policies
around how buildings are going to have less carbon intensity when
they’re built. There’s tons and tons of other work that is required to
actually build the future that we want, that is lower carbon intensity —
ideally zero. But I do think that AI plays an enormous role as decision
support for all those choices that are needed in the future.

Shift Key, a New Climate Podcast from Heatmap News</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-05, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTI3NTg2OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NTE2NTM0NX0.fukOiQoql4_Ns5cC1-Qm0frwpz9X9Qt0ugiwTthBkC8/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
I have some exciting news this morning: Heatmap is launching its first
podcast. <br/>
</p>
<p>
It’s called Shift Key, and it’s hosted by me and Professor Jesse
Jenkins, an expert on energy systems engineering at Princeton
University.
</p>
<p>
Here’s the idea of Shift Key: It’s going to be like listening in on a
call between Jesse and me every week. We want to bring you the most
interesting conversation about climate change and decarbonization that
you’ll hear each week.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Follow us right now at
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/shift-key-with-robinson-meyer-and-jesse-jenkins/id1728932037?i=1000643995810" target="_blank">Apple
Podcasts</a> or on
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0war1dXXCEEZNpZ3H7kRid" target="_blank">Spotify</a>.</strong>
</p>
<p>
You’ve almost certainly
<a href="https://heatmap.news/u/jessed-jenkins" target="_self">seen
Jesse’s work on Heatmap</a> or
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/20/podcasts/transcript-ezra-klein-interviews-jesse-jenkins.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">heard
him on another podcast</a> before. He’s one of the country’s most
important experts on decarbonization and his research helped inform the
Inflation Reduction Act.
</p>
<p>
And while you are probably familiar with
<a href="https://heatmap.news/u/robinsonmeyer" target="_self">my work
here at Heatmap</a>, you may not know I’ve been covering climate change
since 2015.
</p>
<p>
The founding idea of Shift Key — and something that Jesse and I agree on
— is that the energy transition and climate change are not niche topics,
and they’re not something happening hypothetically in the future.
</p>
<p>
Decarbonization and the shift away from fossil fuels are happening now —
and it impacts everything from Main Street to Wall Street, from domestic
politics to geopolitics. It is profoundly reordering the economy, public
health, and consumer decisions.
</p>
<p>
So subscribe to Shift Key now at
<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/shift-key-with-robinson-meyer-and-jesse-jenkins/id1728932037" target="_blank">Apple
Podcasts</a> and listen to our teaser below. Our first episode will come
out later this week.
</p>
<p>
Thanks as always for your support — and thank you for listening.

Barnes &amp; Noble stopped making its own Android tablets years ago, and
has instead been partnering with third-party tablet makers like Samsung
and Lenovo. So it’s unsurprising that the company’s newest tablet is the
NOOK 9″ Lenovo Tablet, or that it looks pretty familiar. That’s because
it’s basically the same tablet as the Lenovo Tab […]

<p>
<strong></strong>Parisians
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/bike-friendly-paris-votes-raising-parking-fees-suvs-2024-02-03/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">voted</a>
in favor of tripling parking fees for “bulky, polluting” SUVs to 18
euros ($19) per hour on Sunday. The fees won’t apply to city residents
or taxis but instead target out-of-towners. The new rule, which could
come into place in September, is part of an ongoing effort to make the
city’s streets friendlier for pedestrians and cyclists. It’s also an
attempt to improve air quality, but hybrid and electric vehicles aren’t
exempt: Combustion-engine and hybrid SUVs weighing more than 1.6 tons
will be subject to the fee, and so will EVs over 2 tons. Last year, the
city voted to get rid of e-scooters. “Parisians have made a clear choice
… other cities will follow,”

<li>There may be ‘no right answer’ to LNG climate question
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>Just how bad is liquified natural gas (LNG) for the
climate? That’s the question of the hour. President Biden recently
paused new LNG export terminals until the Energy Department can provide
some insight. But in the meantime, <em>Heatmap</em>’s Matthew Zeitlin
did his own
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/lng-exports-pause-biden-emissions" target="_self">investigation</a>
into the quandary and found that the answer is complicated and dependent
on a number of ever-evolving factors, including the global energy mix
and emissions levels. “The climate impact of U.S. LNG depends on what it
replaces in countries — whether those alternatives have more or less
emissions than U.S. LNG,” Arvind Ravikumar, a leading scholar on natural
gas and energy policy, told Zeitlin. Indeed, in some cases, natural gas
can replace coal and help reduce emissions. “There’s no right answer,”
Ravikumar said. “It depends on who buys, what time frame, which country,
and how are they using LNG.”<br/><br/>In a world that comes in under 1.5
degrees of warming, the emissions reductions from coal-to-gas switching
peter out after 2035, Zeitlin said. If we don’t hit our Paris Agreement
targets, or if developing countries prioritize cheap, available energy,
then LNG export capacity turns from a potential “stranded asset” into an
insurance policy. The DoE certainly has its work cut out.

<li>What if a heat wave strikes the Paris Olympics?
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>The organizers behind the 2024 Paris Olympics are
accounting for the possibility of a heat wave coinciding with the event,
according to a report from <em>AFP</em>. “Heat waves and extreme weather
events are factors that we take into account and that we are preparing
for as much as possible, in order to take necessary action,” a
spokesperson said. Options include adjusting the times for some sporting
events to avoid the hottest hours of the day. The athletes’ village is
not air-conditioned, but organizers will offer portable A/C units. A
recent
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-023-00500-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a>
published in the journal <em>Npj Climate and Atmospheric Science
</em>warned that there’s a decent chance Paris could experience a
two-week summer heatwave worse than the one that killed 15,000 people in
2003. The city has seen blistering temperatures in recent years, and set
a record high of 108.7 degrees Fahrenheit in 2019.

<h2 id="pluralistic-how-i-got-scammed-05-feb-2024">Pluralistic: How I
got scammed (05 Feb 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-05, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links How I got scammed: And why AI will make it worse. Hey
look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009,
2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent
appearances, current writing projects, current reading How I got scammed
(permalink) I wuz robbed. More specifically, I was tricked by a
phone-phisher pretending to be from my bank, and he convinced me to hand
over my credit-card number, then did $8,000+ worth of fraud with it
before I figured out what happened. And then he tried to do it again, a
week later! Here’s what happened. Over the Christmas holiday, I traveled
to New Orleans. The day we landed, I hit a Chase ATM in the French
Quarter for some cash, but the machine declined the transaction. Later
in the day, we passed a little credit-union’s ATM and I used that one
instead (I bank with a one-branch credit union and generally there’s no
fee to use another CU’s ATM). A couple days later, I got a call from my
credit union. It was a weekend, during the holiday, and the guy who
called was obviously working for my little CU’s after-hours fraud
contractor. I’d dealt with these folks before – they service a ton of
little credit unions, and generally the call quality isn’t great and the
staff will often make mistakes like mispronouncing my credit union’s
name. That’s what happened here – the guy was on a terrible VOIP line
and I had to ask him to readjust his mic before I could even understand
him. He mispronounced my bank’s name and then asked if I’d attempted to
spend $1,000 at an Apple Store in NYC that day. No, I said, and groaned
inwardly. What a pain in the ass. Obviously, I’d had my ATM card skimmed
– either at the Chase ATM (maybe that was why the transaction failed),
or at the other credit union’s ATM (it had been a very cheap looking
system). I told the guy to block my card and we started going through
the tedious business of running through recent transactions, verifying
my identity, and so on. It dragged on and on. These were my last hours
in New Orleans, and I’d left my family at home and gone out to see some
of the pre-Mardi Gras krewe celebrations and get a muffalata, and I
could tell that I was going to run out of time before I finished talking
to this guy. “Look,” I said, “you’ve got all my details, you’ve frozen
the card. I gotta go home and meet my family and head to the airport.
I’ll call you back on the after-hours number once I’m through security,
all right?” He was frustrated, but that was his problem. I hung up, got
my sandwich, went to the airport, and we checked in. It was total chaos:
an Alaska Air 737 Max had just lost its door-plug in mid-air and every
Max in every airline’s fleet had been grounded, so the check in was
crammed with people trying to rebook. We got through to the gate and I
sat down to call the CU’s after-hours line. The person on the other end
told me that she could only handle lost and stolen cards, not fraud, and
given that I’d already frozen the card, I should just drop by the branch
on Monday to get a new card. We flew home, and later the next day, I
logged into my account and made a list of all the fraudulent
transactions and printed them out, and on Monday morning, I drove to the
bank to deal with all the paperwork. The folks at the CU were even more
pissed than I was. The fraud that run up to more than $8,000, and if
Visa refused to take out it of the merchants where the card had been
used, my little credit union would have to eat the loss. I agreed and
commiserated. I also pointed out that their outsource, after-hours fraud
center bore some blame here: I’d canceled the card on Saturday but most
of the fraud had taken place on Sunday. Something had gone wrong. One
cool thing about banking at a tiny credit-union is that you end up
talking to people who have actual authority, responsibility and agency.
It turned out the the woman who was processing my fraud paperwork was a
VP, and she decided to look into it. A few minutes later she came back
and told me that the fraud center had no record of having called me on
Saturday. “That was the fraudster,” she said. Oh, shit. I frantically
rewound my conversation, trying to figure out if this could possibly be
true. I hadn’t given him anything apart from some very anodyne info,
like what city I live in (which is in my Wikipedia entry), my date of
birth (ditto), and the last four digits of my card. Wait a sec. He
hadn’t asked for the last four digits. He’d asked for the last seven
digits. At the time, I’d found that very frustrating, but now – “The
first nine digits are the same for every card you issue, right?” I asked
the VP. I’d given him my entire card number. Goddammit. The thing is, I
know a lot about fraud. I’m writing an entire series of novels about
this kind of scam:
https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865878/thebezzle And most summers,
I go to Defcon, and I always go to the “social engineering” competitions
where an audience listens as a hacker in a soundproof booth cold-calls
merchants (with the owner’s permission) and tries to con whoever answers
the phone into giving up important information. But I’d been conned. Now
look, I knew I could be conned. I’d been conned before, 13 years ago, by
a Twitter worm that successfully phished out of my password via DM:
https://locusmag.com/2010/05/cory-doctorow-persistence-pays-parasites/
That scam had required a miracle of timing. It started the day before,
when I’d reset my phone to factory defaults and reinstalled all my apps.
That same day, I’d published two big online features that a lot of
people were talking about. The next morning, we were late getting out of
the house, so by the time my wife and I dropped the kid at daycare and
went to the coffee shop, it had a long line. Rather than wait in line
with me, my wife sat down to read a newspaper, and so I pulled out my
phone and found a Twitter DM from a friend asking “is this you?” with a
URL. Assuming this was something to do with those articles I’d published
the day before, I clicked the link and got prompted for my Twitter login
again. This had been happening all day because I’d done that mobile
reinstall the day before and all my stored passwords had been wiped. I
entered it but the page timed out. By that time, the coffees were ready.
We sat and chatted for a bit, then went our own ways. I was on my way to
the office when I checked my phone again. I had a whole string of DMs
from other friends. Each one read “is this you?” and had a URL. Oh,
shit, I’d been phished. If I hadn’t reinstalled my mobile OS the day
before. If I hadn’t published a pair of big articles the day before. If
we hadn’t been late getting out the door. If we had been a little more
late getting out the door (so that I’d have seen the multiple DMs, which
would have tipped me off). There’s a name for this in security circles:
“Swiss-cheese security.” Imagine multiple slices of Swiss cheese all
stacked up, the holes in one slice blocked by the slice below it. All
the slices move around and every now and again, a hole opens up that
goes all the way through the stack. Zap! The fraudster who tricked me
out of my credit card number had Swiss cheese security on his side. Yes,
he spoofed my bank’s caller ID, but that wouldn’t have been enough to
fool me if I hadn’t been on vacation, having just used a pair of dodgy
ATMs, in a hurry and distracted. If the 737 Max disaster hadn’t happened
that day and I’d had more time at the gate, I’d have called my bank
back. If my bank didn’t use a slightly crappy outsource/out-of-hours
fraud center that I’d already had sub-par experiences with. If, if, if.
The next Friday night, at 5:30PM, the fraudster called me back,
pretending to be the bank’s after-hours center. He told me my card had
been compromised again. But: I hadn’t removed my card from my wallet
since I’d had it replaced. Also, it was half an hour after the bank
closed for the long weekend, a very fraud-friendly time. And when I told
him I’d call him back and asked for the after-hours fraud number, he got
very threatening and warned me that because I’d now been notified about
the fraud that any losses the bank suffered after I hung up the phone
without completing the fraud protocol would be billed to me. I hung up
on him. He called me back immediately. I hung up on him again and put my
phone into do-not-disturb. The following Tuesday, I called my bank and
spoke to their head of risk-management. I went through everything I’d
figured out about the fraudsters, and she told me that credit unions
across America were being hit by this scam, by fraudsters who somehow
knew CU customers’ phone numbers and names, and which CU they banked at.
This was key: my phone number is a reasonably well-kept secret. You can
get it by spending money with Equifax or another nonconsensual doxing
giant, but you can’t just google it or get it at any of the free
services. The fact that the fraudsters knew where I banked, knew my
name, and had my phone number had really caused me to let down my guard.
The risk management person and I talked about how the credit union could
mitigate this attack: for example, by better-training the after-hours
card-loss staff to be on the alert for calls from people who had been
contacted about supposed card fraud. We also went through the confusing
phone-menu that had funneled me to the wrong department when I called
in, and worked through alternate wording for the menu system that would
be clearer (this is the best part about banking with a small CU – you
can talk directly to the responsible person and have a productive
discussion!). I even convinced her to buy a ticket to next summer’s
Defcon to attend the social engineering competitions. There’s a leak
somewhere in the CU systems’ supply chain. Maybe it’s Zelle, or the
small number of corresponding banks that CUs rely on for SWIFT
transaction forwarding. Maybe it’s even those after-hours
fraud/card-loss centers. But all across the USA, CU customers are
getting calls with spoofed caller IDs from fraudsters who know their
registered phone numbers and where they bank. I’ve been mulling this
over for most of a month now, and one thing has really been eating at
me: the way that AI is going to make this kind of problem much worse.
Not because AI is going to commit fraud, though. One of the truest
things I know about AI is: “we’re nowhere near a place where bots can
steal your job, we’re certainly at the point where your boss can be
suckered into firing you and replacing you with a bot that fails at
doing your job”:
https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/15/passive-income-brainworms/#four-hour-work-week
I trusted this fraudster specifically because I knew that the outsource,
out-of-hours contractors my bank uses have crummy headsets, don’t know
how to pronounce my bank’s name, and have long-ass, tedious, and
pointless standardized questionnaires they run through when taking fraud
reports. All of this created cover for the fraudster, whose plausibility
was enhanced by the rough edges in his pitch – they didn’t raise red
flags. As this kind of fraud reporting and fraud contacting is
increasingly outsourced to AI, bank customers will be conditioned to
dealing with semi-automated systems that make stupid mistakes, force you
to repeat yourself, ask you questions they should already know the
answers to, and so on. In other words, AI will groom bank customers to
be phishing victims. This is a mistake the finance sector keeps making.
15 years ago, Ben Laurie excoriated the UK banks for their “Verified By
Visa” system, which validated credit card transactions by taking users
to a third party site and requiring them to re-enter parts of their
password there:
https://web.archive.org/web/20090331094020/http://www.links.org/?p=591
This is exactly how a phishing attack works. As Laurie pointed out, this
was the banks training their customers to be phished. I came close to
getting phished again today, as it happens. I got back from Berlin on
Friday and my suitcase was damaged in transit. I’ve been dealing with
the airline, which means I’ve really been dealing with their
third-party, outsource luggage-damage service. They have a terrible
website, their emails are incoherent, and they officiously demand the
same information over and over again. This morning, I got a scam email
asking me for more information to complete my damaged luggage claim. It
was a terrible email, from a noreply@ email address, and it was vague,
officious, and dishearteningly bureaucratic. For just a moment, my
finger hovered over the phishing link, and then I looked a little
closer. On any other day, it wouldn’t have had a chance. Today – right
after I had my luggage wrecked, while I’m still jetlagged, and after
days of dealing with my airline’s terrible outsource partner – it almost
worked. So much fraud is a Swiss-cheese attack, and while companies
can’t close all the holes, they can stop creating new ones. Meanwhile,
I’ll continue to post about it whenever I get scammed. I find the inner
workings of scams to be fascinating, and it’s also important to remind
people that everyone is vulnerable sometimes, and scammers are willing
to try endless variations until an attack lands at just the right place,
at just the right time, in just the right way. If you think you can’t
get scammed, that makes you especially vulnerable:

will soon be upon us. Thanks to

<p class="drop-caps">
President Biden’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-lng-exports-pause-young-voters-climate" target="_self">decision</a>
to pause approving liquified natural gas export terminals until it can
better study their climate effects — functionally delaying or even
outright preventing their construction — got real political, real fast.
Almost immediately, West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin called for a
<a href="https://www.energy.senate.gov/hearings/2024/2/full-committee-hearing-to-examine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hearing</a>
on the president’s decision-making.
</p>
<p>
“If the Administration has the facts to prove that additional LNG export
capacity would hurt Americans, they must make that information public
and clear,” he said in a statement last week. “But if this pause is just
another political ploy to pander to keep-it-in-the-ground climate
activists at the expense of American workers, businesses and our allies
in need, I will do everything in my power to end this pause
immediately.”
</p>
<p>
While Senator Manchin is not exactly the administration’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/manchin-ev-tax-credit-rules" target="_self">biggest
fan lately</a>, he’s also asking some pretty interesting questions. One
of the
<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-smoking-gun-for-bidens-big-climate-decision" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">animating
ideas</a> of the past few months in climate politics has been the
argument that LNG (and maybe even pipeline gas) are in fact far worse
than the global climate even than coal, which has long been assumed to
be the dirtiest, most carbon-intensive fossil fuel around. That view is
based on research by Cornell University scientist
<a href="https://www.research.howarthlab.org/publications/Howarth_LNG_assessment_preprint_archived_2023-1103.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Robert
Howarth</a> and has been expounded by
<a href="https://twitter.com/jamieclimate/status/1750848936112206285" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">climate</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/EvergreenAction/status/1750940668791296454?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">advocates</a>
and
<a href="https://twitter.com/SenWarren/status/1750931831308927262" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">elected</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/SenJeffMerkley/status/1750617991526359264" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">officials</a>
alike.
</p>
<p>
But that research has not yet passed through peer review. Even if it
had, Howarth’s past research has gotten
<a href="https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/energy/howarth-natural-gas" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">criticism</a>
from other climate scientists for using some idiosyncratic assumptions
that yield more dramatic results.
</p>
<p>
Make no mistake, meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement and holding
global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels
requires winding down our use of fossil fuels as quickly as possible. If
we meet those goals, the natural gas export terminals delayed by the
Biden administration’s decision will likely go dormant well before the
end of their expected lifespans. But it’s not the case that in all
possible worlds, continuing or even expanding natural gas production and
exports would actually be <em>worse</em> for the climate.
</p>
<p>
The basic physics of coal emissions versus LNG emissions are just part
of the equation. When it’s burned, natural gas releases carbon dioxide,
the primary source of human-caused climate change, albeit less carbon
dioxide than coal. But natural gas is itself mostly methane, CH4, which
traps far more heat than CO2 when it leaks from wells, pipelines, and
production facilities. (LNG is also much more energy-intensive to
extract, produce, and store than regular natural gas, since it has to be
cooled to -260 degrees Fahrenheit, sailed across the ocean and then
“regasified” and shipped via pipeline on the other side.) While CH4 is
more potent than CO2 from a warming perspective, it also breaks down
much more quickly in the atmosphere, which means the warming effect
doesn’t last as long.
</p>
<p>
How to think about LNG’s effect on overall emissions, then, largely
depends on how much you think each of these factors matters. “Only if we
assume high methane leakage rates and a 20-year global warming potential
is natural gas worse than coal, and such assumptions are likely
unrealistic,” wrote Carnegie Mellon energy systems researcher Paulina
Jaramillo in an essay titled,
<a href="https://www.cmu.edu/energy/key-initiatives/open-energy-outlook/navigating-the-lng-dilemma.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">aptly</a>,
“Navigating the LNG Dilemma.”
</p>
<p>
Absolute emissions aren’t even what we should be asking about, Arvind
Ravikumar, a professor at the University of Texas and a leading scholar
on natural gas and energy policy, told me. “The climate impact of U.S.
LNG depends on what it replaces in countries — whether those
alternatives have more or less emissions than U.S. LNG.”
</p>
<p>
When the United States stepped in to replace much of the gas the
European Union would otherwise buy from Russia with LNG, Ravikumar
explained, it likely reduced overall emissions because of lower methane
emissions from the U.S. gas industry. Before the invasion of Ukraine,
Russia supplied about 155 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Europe;
by 2022, that was down to around 80 billion cubic meters. That’s a lot
of energy to replace. In that time, the U.S. more than doubled its LNG
exports to Europe, which has guaranteed demand of at least 50 billion
cubic meters from the U.S. through 2030.
</p>
<p>
Had the U.S. not ramped up its LNG exports, boosters argue, these
countries might not have had a viable alternative and might have turned
to coal, instead. But that won’t be the case in every single possible
future scenario. “There’s no right answer,” Ravikumar told me. “It
depends on who buys, what time frame, which country, and how are they
using LNG.”
</p>
<p>
There’s at least one clear case study of the coal-to-gas switch working
to lower emissions: the United States itself.
</p>
<p>
In 2007, the U.S.
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/coal/use-of-coal.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was
consuming</a> just over 1 billion tons of coal for electricity; by 2016
that had declined to 679 million, and by 2022 to just under 500 million
— in other words, by more than half.
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/natural-gas/use-of-natural-gas.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">In
that same time</a>, natural gas use for electricity grew from 7 trillion
cubic feet in 2007 to 10 trillion cubic feet in 2016 to 12 trillion
cubic feet in 2022.
</p>
<p>
U.S. greenhouse gas emissions have dropped more than 15% since 2007 to
even below their 1992 levels,
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according
to the Environmental Protection
Agency</a><a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/americas-carbon-emissions-fell-for-the-first-time-since-covid" target="_self">
and the Rhodium Group</a>. The drop in emissions has been going on since
2010, which the EPA attributes, in part, to “the growing use of natural
gas and renewables to generate electricity in place of more
carbon-intensive fuels.”
</p>
<p>
As climatologist Zeke Hausfather put it in an
<a href="https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/energy/howarth-natural-gas" target="_blank">earlier
commentary</a> on an earlier Howarth paper, “While it isn’t responsible
for the majority of emissions reductions, natural gas replacing coal is
the largest single driver.”
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
Much of the conceptual infrastructure on which climate policy operates
relies on estimating what the world will be like in the future — not
just figuring out the effects of different levels of greenhouse gas
concentrations in the atmosphere, but also figuring out different likely
pathways for the evolution of those emissions over time.
</p>
<p>
This works in both directions — asking how specific projects either
reduce or lower emissions, and asking about what an energy system would
look like in a world where emissions have been reduced enough to avoid
certain levels of temperature increases. And that’s really where the
rubber meets the road.
</p>
<p>
In a scenario where the world hits its Paris Agreement goals, there
would not be the coal-to-gas switching envisioned by LNG advocates
precisely because there would be very little coal still being used to
generate electricity. The fear, then, is that LNG terminals would either
become stranded assets, capital investments that wind up becoming
liabilities; or that, once they’re in operation, the companies behind
them would use their political and economic leverage — not to mention
just the power of inertia — to keep enough natural gas in the global
energy system to be profitable.
</p>
<p>
“Either you’re building and planning to shut it down early,” Hausfather
told me, “or you’re building something that’s going to be inconsistent
with the world we’re aiming to have under our climate targets.”
</p>
<p>
In a Paris-compliant world, almost 90% of the world’s coal reserves and
over half of the natural gas and oil reserves will stay in the ground,
according to
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03821-8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">researchers</a>
from University College London. They estimate that in order to meet the
Paris targets, gas production would “see rapid decline” from 2020 to
2050 and would be eliminated as a fuel for electricity generation by
2040, with accompanying “low utilization rates of infrastructure, and
limited prospect for future additional liquefaction capacity” for
exports.
</p>
<p>
In other words, in a world that comes in under 1.5 degrees of warming,
the emissions reductions from coal-to-gas switching peter out after
2035; with 2 degrees of warming it’s around 2040 to 2045 — in any case,
beyond the planned life of the export terminals that the Biden
administration’s decision affects.
</p>
<p>
But how much LNG export capacity the United States builds up in the next
decade is only a tiny part of the overall emissions picture now, in
2035, or in 2050. “This is the issue with regulating at a project level
in general,” energy consultant Sean Smillie told me. “The decision of
any given project in the scheme of global emissions is small. For me,
that points to the fact that we’re trying to regulate climate change —
which is a systemic issue — at the project level, and that’s a very hard
thing to do.”
</p>
<p>
The biggest question is just how energy systems overseas evolve — and
what role LNG exports play in that determination. The European Union is
about to
<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/ursula-von-der-leyen-faces-rebellion-party-2040-climate-eu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">decide</a>
whether to reduce its net collective emissions 90% from 1990 levels by
2040, on their way to zero by 2050, which would signal a sharp reduction
in demand coming from that part of the world. Meanwhile, for U.S. LNG
export projects currently in the permitting pipeline, Asian countries
are contracted to receive a much bigger share, according to a Public
Citizen
<a href="https://www.citizen.org/news/fossil-fuel-speculators-benefit-most-from-pending-lng-terminals-sticking-u-s-consumers-with-higher-bills-analysis-shows/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">analysis</a>.
<em>Bloomberg</em>
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-30/asian-buyers-of-lng-from-us-projects-frozen-by-biden-are-studying-alternatives" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a>
that those buyers have started looking elsewhere — including to Russia.
</p>
<p>
But what if we don’t hit our Paris Agreement targets, as the
<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/paris-agreement-goals-failed-climate-change-global-warming-united-nations-climate-review/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">United
Nations</a> and
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-03/cop28-bill-gates-says-world-probably-won-t-meet-2c-climate-warming-goal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bill
Gates</a> agree we’re increasingly unlikely to do? What if developing
countries prioritize cheap, available energy
(<a href="https://coal.nic.in/sites/default/files/2023-12/PIB1987774.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">like
India’s growing coal production</a>) over climate goals? In that case,
Ravikumar argues, then LNG export capacity turns from a potential
“stranded asset” into an insurance policy.
</p>
<p>
“The way to think about LNG in the longer term is the insurance against
a 3 [degrees of warming] world,” Ravikumar told me. If we fail at taking
quick action to change our systems from carbon-polluting to zero-carbon
energy, we might still be doing some coal-to-gas switching by 2050.
</p>
<p>
“It’s hard to say for certain that we will or not need the LNG export
terminals by 2050 and 2060,” Elan Sykes, an energy policy analyst at the
Progressive Policy Institute and an
<a href="https://themessenger.com/opinion/climate-change-uncompromising-activism-threat-environment-geopolitics-biden" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opponent
of the Biden administration’s decision</a>, told me. “Absent aggressive
foreign policy measures [like] a Green Marshall Plan for worldwide clean
energy, it’s hard to imagine a world where LNG doesn’t provide” some
value, whether from continuing to help reduce emissions or simply
maintaining a reliable supply of energy, he said.
</p>
<p>
Modelers are good at figuring out what the energy mix of a 1.5, 2, or
3-degree world would look like. They’re less good at predicting how that
energy mix will evolve over time in the world we actually live in — and
it’s in that world that the Biden administration will have to decide
whether more LNG exports will serve the public interest.
</p>
<p>
The job isn’t just to make decisions for an ideal world. As Hausfather
told me, it’s “aiming at the best versus mitigating the worst.”

id="taylor-swift-wins-album-of-the-year-at-grammy-awards-for-4th-time">Taylor
Swift Wins Album of the Year at Grammy Awards for 4th Time</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Taylor Swift won album of the year at the Grammy Awards
for “Midnights,” breaking the record for most wins in the category with
four. </p>
<p>She began her speech by thanking her producer and friend Jack
Antonoff and added, “I would love to tell you this is the happiest
moment of my life,” she told the crowd, but said she feels this happy
when she creates music and plays shows.</p>
<p>Earlier in the night, Taylor Swift used her 13th Grammy win on Sunday
to announce her new album, “Tortured Poets Department,” will arrive
April 19.</p>
<p>“I know that the way that the Recording Academy voted is a direct
reflection of the passion of the fans,” she said while accepting the
best pop vocal album award. “So, I want to say thank you to the fans by
telling you a secret that I’ve been keeping from you for the last two
years which is that my brand-new album comes out April 19. It’s called
‘The Tortured Poets Department.’ I’m gonna go and post the cover right
now backstage.”</p>
<p>One of the night’s biggest awards, record of the year, went to Miley
Cyrus for “Flowers,” her second-ever Grammy and second of the
night. </p>
<p>“This award is amazing. But I really hope that it doesn’t change
anything because my life was beautiful yesterday,” she said in her
speech.</p>
<p>Victoria Monét won best new artist.</p>
<p>“Thank you to the champagne-servers tonight,” Monét started her
acceptance speech. “Thanks to my mom, a single mom raising this really
bad girl.” Then she started to cry, telling the room that this award was
“15 years in the making.”</p>
<p>Billie Eilish won song of the year for writing the “Barbie” hit,
“What Was I Made For?”</p>
<p>“Thank you to Greta Gerwig for making the best movie of the year,”
Eilish said during her acceptance speech.</p>
<p>It was just one of several standout moments from Sunday’s show,
broadcast live from Cypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Karol G made Grammy history Sunday by becoming the first female
performer to win best música urbana album for her blockbuster “Mañana
Será Bonito” record.</p>
<p>“This is my first time at the Grammys,” she told the audience in
English. “And this is my first time holding my own Grammy.”</p>
<p>Performances were many. Olivia Rodrigo brought her bloodsucking
ballad “vampire” – or in this case, bloodletting, as red liquid dripped
from the walls behind her. Joni Mitchell, 80, made Grammy history by
performing “Both Sides Now” from her 1969 album “Clouds”; Travis Scott
did a medley of “My Eyes,” “I Know?,” and “Fein.” Burna Boy was joined
by Brandy and 21 Savage and did “On Form,” “City Boys,” and “Sittin’ on
Top of the World.”</p>
<p>A long and touching In Memoriam segment celebrated many of the
musical greats lost in the year. Stevie Wonder performed “For Once in My
Life” and “The Best Is Yet To Come” in honor of Tony Bennett; Annie
Lennox delivered “Nothing Compares 2 U” for Sinéad O’Connor. “Artists
for ceasefire, peace in the world,” Lennox said at the end of the song,
her fist extended in the air.</p>
<p>Jon Batiste did a medley of “Ain’t No Sunshine,” “Lean On Me,” and
finally “Optimistic” with Ann Nesby for the late great music exec
Clarence Avant. Oprah introduced a fiery Tina Turner tribute of “Proud
Mary” by Fantasia Barrino and Adam Blackstone.</p>
<p>SZA also took the stage – performing a medley of her larger-than-life
hits “Snooze” and “Kill Bill,” joined by dancers wielding katanas.</p>
<p>Later, she’d take home the trophy for best R&amp;B song — for
“Snooze,” handed to her by Lizzo. SZA ran to the stage and gave a
charming, out of breath speech because she was “changing, and then I
took a shot,” before starting to tear up and saying, “Hi Taylor… I’m not
an attractive crier. Have a good evening.”</p>
<p>Mariah Carey presented the night’s first award, for best pop solo
performance, to Miley Cyrus for “Flowers.” It was also the singer’s
first-ever Grammy.</p>
<p>Afterward, Luke Combs’ delivered a heartfelt rendition of “Fast Car”
with Tracy Chapman – his cover of the Chapman classic has dominated
country radio and won him song of the year at the 2023 CMAs. In 1989,
Chapman won best pop vocal performance, female for the song.</p>
<p>Dua Lipa opened the show with a high-octane medley: first, a tease of
her forthcoming single, “Training Season,” then, her most recent single,
“Houdini,” and finally, her disco-pop “Barbie” hit “Dance the
Night.”</p>
<p>Eilish and Finneas brought their “Barbie” ballad to the Grammys stage
with live string accompaniment, the second of two songs from the
blockbuster film in one hour. They were followed by Cyrus, who performed
“Flowers” for the first time live on television – moments after
receiving her first Grammy. </p>
<p>“Why are you acting like you don’t know this song?” she teased the
crowd — John Legend and wife Chrissy Teigen were among those in the
audience who got up to dance — and later cheered mid-song, “I just won
my first Grammy!”</p>
<p>Four-time Grammy host — and two time nominee — Trevor Noah greeted an
excited crowd, starting things off with a kiss on the cheek from Meryl
Streep. “The Grammys are gonna win as Oscar,” he joked about the
moment.</p>
<p>Best country album went to Lainey Wilson for “Bell Bottom Country,” —
her very first Grammy — as presented by Kacey Musgraves. “I’m a
fifth-generation farmer’s daughter,” she told the crowd, adding that
she’s a “songwriting farmer,” and that’s where the musical magic came
from.</p>
<p>Jay-Z was awarded the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award and used his speech
to talk about the hip-hop greats that came before him – and heavily
suggesting at the Grammys history of placing rap on the backburner – or
at the very least, not in the televised version of the show. (This year,
there were no rap categories on screen, but two pop, one Latin, one
country and one R&amp;B.)</p>
<p>“We want you all to get it right,” he said. “At least get it close to
right,” before switching focus to Beyoncé. “Most Grammys, never won
album of the year. How does that work?”</p>
<p>Bridgers took an early lead at the Grammys, quickly winning four
trophies ahead of the main telecast, with her and her boygenius
bandmates bringing an infectious energy to the Premiere Ceremony.</p>
<p>Songwriter Justin Tranter gave her the first award Sunday, best pop
duo/group performance, which went to SZA and Bridgers for “Ghost in the
Machine.”</p>
<p>Jack Antonoff took home producer of the year, non-classical for a
third year in a row, tying Babyface as the only other producer to do so
consecutively. “You need the door kicked open for you,” he said in his
acceptance speech. “Taylor Swift kicked that (expletive) door open for
me,” referencing their work together.</p>
<p>The first of three new categories in 2024, best pop dance recording,
was given out shortly afterward and went to Kylie Minogue for “Padam
Padam” — her first win in 18 years.</p>
<p>About 80 Grammys were handed out pre-broadcast. Regional Mexican star
Peso Pluma won his first Grammy for his first and only nomination, for
best música Mexicana album for his “Genesis.”</p>

<h2 id="routines">Routines</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-05, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
They say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and
over again and expecting a different result. I found the inverse of that
to also be true for my life. Doing things differently day after day and
expecting the same–positive–outcome.
</p>
<p>
I’m the product of two terrible traits: I’m a morning person but I also
lack self-discipline. And that means keeping a morning routine is
incredibly hard for me. And yet, every time I manage to do that I feel
really well. My mind is in a much better place when I wake up at 6 am or
even 5 am. I feel a lot better when I’m out in nature with the sun
rising. I know it. I’m aware of all this. And yet keeping a morning
routine is incredibly hard. I’m getting better at it though so I’m
pleased with that.
</p>
<p>
Learning how my mind works is a fun process. You’re tempted to think you
just know yourself and yet there’s always a new discovery waiting behind
the corner. Thankfully I have my whole life to figure this stuff out.
