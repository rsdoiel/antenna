too much slowing? We dig in. Plus, we’ll hear how the economy of
Necoclí, Colombia, has shifted to serve migrants stopping there.

blocks of content that Google crams into a search results page, leaving

published in the journal <em>Nature</em> looks further into the past and
concludes that last summer was the warmest in some 2,000 years in the
Northern Hemisphere. To reach this conclusion, researchers examined
thousands of tree rings, which
<a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/how-can-tree-rings-teach-us-about-climate?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_HTL0qv80xu6z2-aufQIIU9RvuHVrUZ9AF_X3pGd_w-k_JwBEOdLEUVyIeavPlnEjCzpGJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">offer
clues</a> about a year’s temperature and moisture levels. The tree ring
data suggests last summer was about 4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the
average temperature of the years 1 AD to 1890 AD. The study warns that
summer 2024 could be even warmer than 2023.

was fueled by man-caused climate change. In the Philippines, for
example, a 15-day heat wave pushed the heat index to 113 degrees

<li>Trump chides Biden on new Chinese EV tariffs
</h3>
<p>
President Biden confirmed yesterday that he is imposing a 100% tariff on
Chinese-made electric vehicles, as well as tariff increases on other
clean energy technologies including lithium batteries, solar cells, and
critical minerals. Former President Trump, speaking from outside the New
York courtroom where his hush money trial is taking place,
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/trump-trashes-tariffs-outside-manhattan-trial/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_HTL0qv80xu6z2-aufQIIU9RvuHVrUZ9AF_X3pGd_w-k_JwBEOdLEUVyIeavPlnEjCzpGJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>:
“Where have they been for three-and-a-half years? They should have done
it a long time ago.”
</p>
<p>
There is no equivalence between Biden’ tariffs and the 10% across the
board tariff on all imported goods from all countries that Trump has
proposed,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/china-tariffs-biden-evs?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_HTL0qv80xu6z2-aufQIIU9RvuHVrUZ9AF_X3pGd_w-k_JwBEOdLEUVyIeavPlnEjCzpGJ" rel="noopener" target="_self">wrote
Heatmap’s Robinson Meyer</a>. “Biden’s new tariffs focus on certain
strategic sectors that American officials believe the country must
cultivate to stay at the technological frontier, coupled with
pre-existing subsidies meant to spur domestic production of those goods.
Some of the tariffs only kick in beginning in 2026 — far enough in the
future, policymakers hope, for the market to prepare. Trump’s tariffs,
meanwhile, would intentionally and chaotically hike prices.”

Plug Power a conditional commitment of $1.66 billion in loan guarantees
to build up to six clean hydrogen plants that use the company’s
electrolyzer technology. The hydrogen would “power fuel cell-electric
vehicles used in the material handling, transportation, and industrial
sectors, resulting in an estimated 84% reduction in greenhouse gas
emissions compared to conventional hydrogen production,” the DOE
announcement said. Most hydrogen production uses fossil fuels to run an
electrolyzer that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. But clean
hydrogen relies on electrolyzers powered by renewable sources – or
natural gas with carbon capture. The Biden administration sees clean
hydrogen as a key part of its push to decarbonize heavy industry. The
deal isn’t done yet – Plug will have to prove its projects will benefit
local communities and “satisfy certain technical, legal, environmental,
and financial conditions” before the loan goes ahead. But the news sent

The Cloud Aerosol Research Instrument, or CARI, sits on the flight deck
of the Hornet, a decommissioned aircraft carrier in Alameda, California.
It sprays sea salt aerosol particles into the air, a process that could
one day be used to brighten clouds and reflect the sun’s rays. This
experiment, which began in early April, marked the first time such a
device had been tested outdoors in the U.S. But the city of Alameda told
the scientists to stop their research until the health and environmental
impacts of the experiment can be evaluated. “The city is evaluating the
chemical compounds in the spray to determine if they are a hazard either
inhaled in aerosol form by humans and animals, or landing on the ground
or in the bay,” city officials said.

poodle Sage fetches top prize at Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — A sprightly miniature poodle named Sage was crowned “Best
in Show” on Tuesday at the 148th annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog
Show, winning the grand prize in the most prestigious competition among
pure-bred canines in the United States.</p>
<p>Sage, the finalist representing 21 breeds classified as non-sporting
dogs, triumphed over more than 2,500 top-ranked dogs competing in the
two-day contest, held at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis
Center in the Queens borough of New York City.</p>
<p>Sage, a 4-year-old black-colored female groomed in the fine, fluffy
topiary style traditional for poodles, competed head to head against the
winners in six other groups — terriers, hounds, herding dogs, working
dogs, sporting dogs and toy dogs.</p>
<p>She was the first female to win the top prize at Westminster since
2020, according to commentators on the Fox Sports channel, which
broadcast the event live.</p>
<p>And she became the fourth miniature poodle to claim the top prize in
the 148-year history of the contest, with the trophy previously going to
her breed in 1943, 1959 and 2002, according to kennel club records.</p>
<p>The larger “standard” poodle breed has been declared Best in Show
five times, most recently in 2020, and the smaller “toy” poodle breed
has won twice.</p>
<p>The poodle originated as a hunting dog in Germany and is now
recognized as the national dog of France.</p>
<p>Sage’s handler, Kaz Hosaka, cried tears of joy and carried his prized
poodle in his arms around floor of the auditorium to cheers of the crowd
as he celebrated what he said was his 45th year participating at the
Westminster dog show and the last of his career.</p>
<p>The Westminster dog show bills itself as the second-oldest U.S.
sporting event, behind only the Kentucky Derby thoroughbred horse race.
This year’s competition drew a field of contenders representing 200
breeds from all 50 U.S. states and 12 other countries.</p>
<p>Mercedes, a female 4-year-old German shepherd, was named runner-up
for the overall contest, after first winning the top prize in the
herding dog group.</p>
<p>Along with Sage and Mercedes, the two other finalists chosen on
Monday were Comet the Shih Tzu, representing the toy group, and Louis,
the Afghan hound leading the hound group.</p>
<p>Rounding out the finalists were three group winners chosen on Tuesday
- Micah the black cocker spaniel, representing sporting dogs; Monty, the
giant schnauzer, leading the working dogs; and Frankie, a colored bull
terrier from the terrier group.</p>

Transmission has been one of the biggest obstacles of decarbonizing the
power grid in America. In the past week, however, the country has taken
two big steps toward finally removing it.
</p>
<p>
Last week, the Department of Energy published a list of 10 high-priority
areas for grid development, called National Interest Electric
Transmission Corridors, designed to help accelerate some of the most
annoying aspects of the siting process. Then on Monday, the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission passed a new rule directing grid planners
to take a longer view on what America’s future electricity needs will
look like.

<p>
On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob and Jesse talk with two special
guests —
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/gdo/person/maria-robinson" target="_blank">Maria
Robinson</a>, who leads the Energy Department’s Grid Deployment Office,
and Heatmap reporter
<a href="https://heatmap.news/u/matthewzeitlin" target="_blank">Matthew
Zeitlin</a> — about what these measures mean for the Biden
administration’s climate policy and how soon we might see new power
lines get built. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding
executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a professor of energy
systems engineering at Princeton University.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Robinson Meyer:</strong> Wow. Okay. So basically, any — so can I
just back up for a second? I think, first of all, I just want to go:
Wow. So all of, the whole power we’re talking about today is very
important. There’s nothing else like it in the federal government. But
also, you’re going to have to do a whole NEPA process on it?<br/> <br/>
<strong>Maria Robinson:</strong> Yes, so we’re going to have to do a
whole NEPA process for each one of these areas that we’re designating
for NIETCs. And then the other part of this is that if they access some
funding, they’re going to have to do another NEPA process. And if they
access backstop siting at a FERC, you may have to do another NEPA
process. And I know Congress is investigating a couple of remedies to
that.<br/> <br/> <strong>Jesse Jenkins:</strong> So that’s pretty
important. Because the goal here is to try to accelerate the development
of transmission, which is critical to tap into the best wind and solar
resources across the country that can help lower electricity costs and
help decarbonize the grid to meet the growing need for electricity.
That’s coming from data centers, as listeners have heard here on Shift
Key, from electrification of vehicles, hydrogen production, etc. So
we’ve got a big pressure to increase the electricity supply in the
country. And, you know, the cheapest resources are renewables, but we’ve
got to be able to plug them into the grid.<br/> <br/> So if this process
is going to … designating these NIETCs and then ultimately getting
transmission lines built out within them, with access to federal support
for financing and backstop siting authority, is going to play out over a
multi-year NEPA process — or several of them — how quickly could we
realistically expect to start seeing transmission lines built within
some of these corridors?<br/> <br/> <strong>Maria Robinson:</strong>
What’s great about the cohort — and this is just our very first cohort
of those named national transmission corridors. We anticipate that we’ll
open up applications again, maybe as soon as this fall, for another
round, as well, depending on how many we move forward with to do full
NEPA on. It really depends on our ability to get all of that NEPA done.
<br/> <br/> But some of these are really ready for prime time. Some of
them are just looking for some additional financing. And are looking at
construction dates as soon as, say, 2028, 2029, which in the grand
scheme of things for transmission is relatively soon.

<p>Friends, In a few weeks, Donald Trump may be a convicted criminal.
It’s hardly a sure thing, of course. All he needs for a mistrial is one
holdout juror. But the evidence so far seems overwhelming and damning.
So we have to face a daunting reality. For the first time in history, a
convicted criminal may be the nominee of one of our major parties and on
November’s presidential ballot.</p>

id="administration-sending-1-billion-more-in-weapons-to-israel-sources-say">Administration
sending $1 billion more in weapons to Israel, sources say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Biden administration has told key lawmakers it is
sending a new package of more than $1 billion in arms and ammunition to
Israel, three congressional aides said Tuesday.</p>
<p>It’s the first arms shipment to Israel to be announced by the
administration since it put another arms transfer — consisting of 3,500
bombs — on hold this month. The administration has said it paused that
earlier transfer to keep Israel from using the bombs in its growing
offensive in the crowded southern Gaza city of Rafah.</p>
<p>The White House has come under criticism from both sides of the
political spectrum in the U.S. over its military support for Israel’s
now seven-month war against Hamas in Gaza. Some of President Joe Biden’s
fellow Democrats have pushed him to limit transfers of offensive weapons
to Israel to pressure the U.S. ally to do more to protect Palestinian
civilians. Many Republicans condemn any lessening of military backing to
Israel.</p>
<p>The package being sent includes about $700 million for tank
ammunition, $500 million in tactical vehicles and $60 million in mortar
rounds, the congressional aides said. They spoke on condition of
anonymity to discuss an arms transfer that has not yet been made
public.</p>
<p>There was no immediate indication when the arms would be sent. It’s
not clear if this shipment is part of the long-delayed foreign aid
package that Congress passed and Biden signed last month, a tranche from
existing arms sale or a new sale.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal first reported the plans to move the
package.</p>
<p>House Republicans were planning this week to advance a bill to
mandate the delivery of offensive weaponry for Israel. Following Biden’s
move to put a pause on bomb shipments last week, Republicans have been
swift in their condemnation, arguing it represents the abandonment of
the closest U.S. ally in the Middle East.</p>
<p>The White House said Tuesday that Biden would veto the bill if it
were to pass Congress. The bill also has practically no chance in the
Democratic-controlled Senate. But House Democrats are somewhat divided
on the issue, and roughly two dozen have signed onto a letter to the
Biden administration saying they were “deeply concerned about the
message” sent by pausing the bomb shipment.</p>
<p>In addition to the written veto threat, the White House has been in
touch with various lawmakers and congressional aides about the
legislation, according to an administration official.</p>
<p>“We strongly, strongly oppose attempts to constrain the President’s
ability to deploy U.S. security assistance consistent with U.S. foreign
policy and national security objectives,” White House press secretary
Karine Jean-Pierre said this week, adding that the administration plans
to spend “every last cent” appropriated by Congress in the national
security supplemental package that was signed into law by Biden last
month.</p>

id="republicans-advance-senate-candidates-in-west-virginia-maryland">Republicans
advance Senate candidates in West Virginia, Maryland</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ANNAPOLIS, Md. — Republican voters advanced strong Senate contenders
in Maryland and West Virginia on Tuesday, giving the party a big boost
in its push to claim control of Congress’ upper chamber.</p>
<p>Former Governor Larry Hogan claimed the Republican nomination in what
will be a marquee race in Maryland against Angela Alsobrooks, a top
local official who could become the fourth Black woman in U.S. history
to serve in the Senate.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another popular Republican, Governor Jim Justice, won the
Senate nomination in deep-red West Virginia, becoming the overwhelming
favorite in the race that represents the Republicans’ best pickup
opportunity in the nation.</p>
<p>In both states, which share a border but feature antithetical
politics, the Republican nominees represent a serious challenge for
Democrats in the general election as they cling to a 51-49 Senate
majority and defend seats in other states that former President Donald
Trump won four years ago.</p>
<p>At the same time, Trump and Democratic President Joe Biden sought to
project strength in low-stakes presidential primaries. And further down
the ballot, two people who were on opposite sides of the Jan. 6
insurrection lost their U.S. House bids — a former Capitol Police
officer running in Maryland and a former West Virginia state lawmaker
who participated in the riot.</p>
<p>In all, three states hosted statewide primary elections Tuesday —
Maryland, Nebraska and West Virginia — as Republicans and Democrats
picked their nominees for a slate of November elections that will decide
the presidency and control of Congress.</p>
<p>Maryland</p>
<p>In Maryland, Hogan gives Republicans a legitimate chance at picking
up a Senate seat in the deep-blue state for the first time in more than
four decades.</p>
<p>Hogan overcame his years-long criticism of Trump, a position that put
him at odds with many Republican primary voters but will undoubtedly
help him in the general election this fall. Maryland voters gave Biden a
33-point victory over Trump four years ago.</p>
<p>On the other side in the Senate contest, Democratic voters nominated
Alsobrooks, the top official in Prince George’s County outside of
Washington. The 53-year-old African American county executive had been
endorsed by many of the state’s top officials, including Governor Wes
Moore, Senator Chris Van Hollen and U.S. Representative Steny Hoyer.</p>
<p>Alsobrooks prevailed after a contentious and expensive primary
against U.S. Representative David Trone, a liquor store magnate who had
invested more than $61 million into his unsuccessful bid.</p>
<p>Race was an issue in the Democratic primary and may be in the general
election in the months ahead. Alsobrooks is trying to become the first
Black senator from a state in which roughly one in three residents
identifies as African American.</p>
<p>On the social media site X, Hogan congratulated Alsobrooks and said,
“Voters have a clear and stark choice: more of the dysfunctional
partisan status quo or real independent and bipartisan leadership.”</p>
<p>Alsobrooks, also posting on X, promised to “defeat Larry Hogan, keep
Maryland blue, and keep our Senate under Democratic control.”</p>
<p>West Virginia</p>
<p>Justice won his primary against U.S. Representative Alex Mooney in
the race to replace Senator Joe Manchin. With Manchin gone, the seat is
almost guaranteed to turn red come November.</p>
<p>Justice, a former billionaire with a folksy personality, is wildly
popular in the state. He also earned Trump’s endorsement. A former
Democrat, Justice switched to the Republican Party in 2017, announcing
the change at a Trump rally.</p>
<p>Mooney had tried to win over conservatives by labeling Justice as
someone who would support Democratic policies. Justice did support
Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure law, saying West Virginia couldn’t
afford to turn away the money offered in the bill.</p>
<p>West Virginia is also deciding its candidates for governor. Attorney
General Patrick Morrisey, the Republican nominee in the 2018 Senate race
against Manchin, is running for the Republican nomination. He’s up
against former state Representative Moore Capito, whose mother is
Senator Shelley Moore Capito.</p>
<p>Presidential primary</p>
<p>Biden and Trump have already amassed enough delegates to claim the
presidential nominations at their respective national conventions this
summer. Yet voters on both sides hope to register a significant protest
vote Tuesday that will demonstrate their dissatisfaction with the
Biden-Trump rematch.</p>
<p>Both Biden and Trump won their primaries in West Virginia and
Maryland.</p>
<p>Still, Maryland progressives especially unhappy with the Biden
administration’s support for Israel in its war against Hamas had
encouraged voters to select “uncommitted to any presidential candidate”
instead of Biden. There was no uncommitted option in West Virginia or
Nebraska.</p>
<p>Everett Bellamy, a Democrat who voted early in Annapolis, said he
voted “uncommitted” instead of Biden as a protest against the killing of
women and children and noncombatants in Gaza.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Trump’s Republican critics cannot choose “uncommitted,”
but they can choose his former Republican rival Nikki Haley, who will
appear on the ballot in Maryland, Nebraska and West Virginia despite
formally suspending her campaign more than two months ago.</p>
<p>Derek Faux, an independent voter from Charleston, West Virginia, said
he supported Haley, and in other Republican races, he said he voted for
the candidates he believed were least like Trump.</p>
<p>Capitol attack</p>
<p>Tuesday’s elections also included two candidates who were intimately
involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>In Maryland, former Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn was among
nearly two dozen Democrats running in the state’s 3rd Congressional
District. The 40-year-old Democrat lost to State Senator Sarah
Elfreth.</p>
<p>In West Virginia, a former member of the House of Delegates, Derrick
Evans, lost his bid to oust incumbent Republican Representative Carol
Miller in the 1st Congressional District.</p>
<p>The 39-year-old Evans served a three-month jail sentence after
livestreaming himself participating in the storming of the U.S.
Capitol.</p>
<p>Other key races</p>
<p>In Nebraska, Republican Senators Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts both
face nominal opposition in their primaries, one of the rare occasions
when both senators in a state are on the ballot at the same time. And in
Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District, Republican U.S. Representative
Don Bacon faces a challenge from his right flank.</p>
<p>In North Carolina, voters finalized their pick of the Trump-endorsed
Brad Knott in what had become a one-person Republican primary in the
state’s 13th Congressional District.</p>

<h2
id="justice-department-says-boeing-could-be-prosecuted-in-737-max-crashes">Justice
Department says Boeing could be prosecuted in 737 Max crashes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Boeing has violated a settlement that allowed the
company to avoid criminal prosecution after two deadly crashes involving
its 737 Max aircraft more than five years ago, the Justice Department
told a federal judge on Tuesday.</p>
<p>It is now up to the Justice Department to decide whether to file
charges against Boeing. Prosecutors will tell the court no later than
July 7 how they plan to proceed, the department said.</p>
<p>New 737 Max jets crashed in 2018 in Indonesia and 2019 in Ethiopia,
killing 346 people. Boeing reached a $2.5 billion settlement with the
Justice Department in January 2021 to avoid prosecution on a single
charge of fraud — misleading federal regulators who approved the plane.
Boeing blamed the deception on two relatively low-level employees.</p>
<p>In a letter filed Tuesday in federal court in Texas, Glenn Leon, head
of the Justice Department criminal division’s fraud section, said Boeing
violated terms of the settlement by failing to make promised changes to
detect and prevent violations of federal anti-fraud laws.</p>
<p>The determination means that Boeing could be prosecuted “for any
federal criminal violation of which the United States has knowledge,”
including the charge of fraud that the company hoped to avoid with the
settlement, the Justice Department said.</p>
<p>However, it is not clear whether the government will prosecute
Boeing.</p>
<p>“The Government is determining how it will proceed in this matter,”
the Justice Department said in the court filing. Boeing will have until
June 13 to respond to the government’s allegation, and department said
it will consider the company’s explanation “in determining whether to
pursue prosecution.”</p>
<p>Boeing Co., which is based in Arlington, Virginia, disputed the
Justice Department’s finding.</p>
<p>“We believe that we have honored the terms of that agreement, and
look forward to the opportunity to respond to the Department on this
issue,” a Boeing spokesperson said in a statement. “As we do so, we will
engage with the Department with the utmost transparency, as we have
throughout the entire term of the agreement, including in response to
their questions following the Alaska Airlines 1282 accident.”</p>
<p>Boeing has come under renewed scrutiny since that Alaska Airlines
flight in January, when a door plug blew out of a 737 Max, leaving a
gaping hole in the side of the jetliner. The company is under multiple
investigations into the blowout and its manufacturing quality. The FBI
has told passengers from the flight that they might be victims of a
crime.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said they will meet on May 31 with families of passengers
who died in the two Max crashes. Family members were angry and
disappointed after a similar meeting last month.</p>
<p>Paul Cassell, a lawyer who represents families of passengers in the
second crash, said the Justice Department’s determination that Boeing
breached the settlement terms is “a positive first step, and for the
families, a long time coming.”</p>
<p>“But we need to see further action from DOJ to hold Boeing
accountable, and plan to use our meeting on May 31 to explain in more
details what we believe would be a satisfactory remedy to Boeing’s
ongoing criminal conduct,” Cassell said.</p>
<p>Investigations into the crashes pointed to a flight-control system
that Boeing added to the Max without telling pilots or airlines. Boeing
downplayed the significance of the system, then didn’t overhaul it until
after the second crash.</p>
<p>After secret negotiations, the government agreed not to prosecute
Boeing on a charge of defrauding the United States by deceiving
regulators about the flight system. The settlement included a $243.6
million fine, a $500 million fund for victim compensation, and nearly
$1.8 billion to airlines whose Max jets were grounded for nearly two
years.</p>

<h2 id="the-new-apt-3.0-solver">The new APT 3.0 solver</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>A crucial but often entirely transparent feature of a modern package
management system like Debian’s APT is its solver – basically the set of
rules and instruction on how to handle dependencies when installing a
package. APT is currently in the process of radically changing its
solver, the first bits of which can be found in APT 2.9.3, referred to
as solver3. Many of the changes and improvements get a little into the
weeds and will mostly be transparent to users, but there is one feature
the new solver will enable that many of you will be incredibly excited
about. One of the core new capabilities of solver3 is the implication
graph. As part of the solving phase, we also construct an implication
graph, albeit a partial one: The first package installing another
package is marked as the reason (A -&gt; B), the same thing for
conflicts (not A -&gt; not B). ↫ Julian Andres Klode Seems rather
innocuous at first sight, but here’s what the implication graph will
make possible: The implication graph building allows us to implement an
apt why command, that while not as nicely detailed as aptitude, at least
tells you the exact reason why a package is installed. It will only show
the strongest dependency chain at first of course, since that is what we
record. ↫ Julian Andres Klode If you’ve ever dealt with packaging issues
– probably when running -testing or similar unstable distributions that
use APT, a command that tells you exactly why a package is installed is
an absolute godsend. Sure, aptitude exists, but aptitude takes you out
of your current CLI workflow, whereas this will be much easier to
quickly run. There’s more features solver3 will enable, but this one is
definitely one of my favourite low-level additions to APT in a long,
long time.</p>

<h2 id="google-details-some-of-the-ai-features-coming-to-android">Google
details some of the “AI” features coming to Android</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>Google I/O, the company’s developer conference, started today, but
for the first time since I can remember, Android and Chrome OS have been
relegated to day two of the conference. The first day was all about
“AI”, most of which I’m not even remotely interested in, except of
course where it related to Google’s operating system offerings. And the
company did have a few things to say about “AI” on Android, and the
general gist is that yeah, they’re going to be stuffing it into every
corner of the operating system. Google’s “AI” tool Gemini will be
integrated deeply into Android, and you’ll be able to call up an overlay
wherever you are in the operating system, and do things like summarise a
PDF that’s on screen, summarise a YouTube video, generate images on the
fly and drop them into emails and conversations, and so on. A more
interesting and helpful “AI” addition is using it to improve TalkBack,
so that people with impaired vision can let the device describe images
on the screen for them. Google claims TalkBack users come across about
90 images without description every day (!), so this is a massive
improvement for people with impaired vision, and a genuinely helpful and
worthwhile “AI” feature. Creepier is that Google’s “AI” will also be
able to listen along with your phone calls, and warn you if an ongoing
conversation is a scamming attempt. If the person on the other end of
the line claiming to be your bank asks you to move a bunch of money
around to keep it safe, Gemini will pop up and warn you it’s a scam,
since banks don’t ask you such things. Clever, sure, but also absolutely
terrifying and definitely not something I’ll be turning on. Google
claims all of these features take place on-device, so privacy should be
respected, but I’m always a bit unsure about such things staying that
way in the future. Regardless, “AI” is coming to Android in a big way,
but I’m just here wondering how much of it I’ll be able to turn off.</p>

Workstation Pro and Fusion pro go free for personal use</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>After Broadcom acquired VMware, there’s been a steady stream of
worrying or outright bad news for people using VMware products at home,
for personal use, as enthusiasts. The biggest blow to the enthusiast
market was the end of perpetual licensing, forcing people into
subscriptions instead. Finally, though it seems we’re getting some good
news. The most exciting part is that Fusion Pro and Workstation Pro will
now have two license models. We now provide a Free Personal Use or a
Paid Commercial Use subscription for our Pro apps. Users will decide
based on their use case whether a commercial subscription is required.
This means that everyday users who want a virtual lab on their Mac,
Windows or Linux computer can do so for free simply by registering and
downloading the bits from the new download portal located at
support.broadcom.com. ↫ Michael Roy on the VMware blog This is
definitely good news for us enthusiasts, and it means I won’t have to
buy a cheap VMware license off eBay every few years anymore, so I’m
quite satisfied here. However, with VMware under Broadcom focusing more
and more on the enterprise and squeezing every last penny out of those
customers, one has to wonder if this ‘free for personal use’ is just a
prelude to winding down the development of enthusiasts’ tools
altogether. It wouldn’t be the first time that a product going free for
personal use was a harbinger of worse things yet to come.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
The United States
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/14/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-action-to-protect-american-workers-and-businesses-from-chinas-unfair-trade-practices/" target="_blank">raised
tariffs</a> on a range of Chinese-made climate technologies on Tuesday,
including electric vehicles, solar panels, and battery components.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45236/thirteen-ways-of-looking-at-a-blackbird" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Inspired
by the poet Wallace Stevens</u></a>, here are 13 ways of looking at
them:
</p>
<h4>
<ol type="1">
<li></h4>
<p>
The biggest tariffs in the bunch are for Chinese-made electric vehicles.
The Biden administration has more than quadrupled them, imposing a 100%
tariff on all vehicle imports. That means that Chinese-made EVs now face
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2018/03/28/u-s-tariffs-vary-a-lot-but-the-highest-duties-tend-to-be-on-imported-clothing/" target="_blank">higher
tariff levels</a> than any other imported goods.
</p>
<p>
Right now, the U.S. imports relatively few electric vehicles from China,
and the few vehicles that we do import — which are made by the
Chinese-owned brands Volvo and Polestar — may not be affected by these
levies
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/how-volvo-landed-cheap-chinese-ev-us-shores-trade-war-2024-04-24/" target="_blank">because
of how imports are counted under tariff law</a>. (Neither Volvo nor
Polestar has commented on the new rates.)
</p>
<p>
What’s more, the White House
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/chinese-ev-cars-biden" target="_self"><u>suggested
in February that it would use national security law</u></a> to prevent
EVs from Chinese companies from coming into the United States at all —
even if the cars were made in a country with which the U.S. has a free
trade agreement, such as Mexico. So despite the eye-popping headline
figure, the tariffs on Chinese EVs do relatively little to change the
decarbonization calculus in the United States. America wasn’t going to
import Chinese-made EVs before, and it’s not going to do so now.
</p>
<h4>
2.
</h4>
<p>
<strong></strong>While these EV tariffs may be more for show than
anything else, that is <em><em>not </em></em>true for the other tariffs
on clean technologies. Many of these categories already faced trade
levies imposed by the Trump administration, and Biden has now raised
them, effectively doubling down on his electoral rival’s policy.
</p>
<p>
Starting immediately:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>For lithium-ion EV batteries</strong>, tariffs rise from 7.5% to
25%.
</li>
<li>
<strong>For EV battery parts</strong>, tariffs rise from 7.5% to 25%.
(This closes a loophole in the Trump levies in which <em><em>completed
</em></em>EV batteries faced a much lower tariff rate than battery
components, encouraging automakers to import finished batteries.)
</li>
<li>
<strong>For many critical minerals</strong>, tariffs rise from zero to
25%.
</li>
<li>
<strong>For solar cells</strong>, tariffs rise from 25% to 50%.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The solar cell figure looks impressive — and has been the source of
wrangling in the solar industry — but it matters less than it looks. The
United States already imports
<a href="https://www.rechargenews.com/energy-transition/us-factories-under-threat-from-unprecedented-wave-of-chinese-solar-panel-imports/2-1-1604599" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
than 80% of its solar panels</u></a> from Chinese companies operating in
other Asian countries.
</p>
<p>
A second round of tariffs is scheduled to kick in in 2026. Even though
these hikes won’t take effect immediately, they may counterintuitively
matter <em><em>more</em></em>, because they affect sectors where China
now dominates the global industry. The longer timeline suggests that the
White House is trying not to disrupt the near-term market too much; in
effect, it’s giving companies a deadline to diversify their supply
chains. This second round includes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>For non-EV lithium-ion batteries</strong>, such as the type
you’d need for
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/texas-california-grid-batteries" target="_self"><u>grid-scale
batteries</u></a>, tariffs rise from 7.5% to 25% in 2026. These
batteries are already changing
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/05/07/climate/battery-electricity-solar-california-texas.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>how
the power grid works</u></a> and the White House may be loath to stop
the progress.
</li>
<li>
<strong>For natural graphite and permanent magnets</strong>, tariffs
will rise to 25% in 2026. China
<a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-new-graphite-restrictions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>refines
90% of the world’s graphite</u></a>, and it
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/graphite-batteries-trade-war-us-china" target="_self"><u>has
already tried</u></a> to use this as leverage in a trade dispute with
the U.S., imposing export restrictions on three high-purity grades of
graphite last year.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li></h4>
<p>
Whether you love them or hate them, you shouldn’t see these tariffs as a
standalone measure. They complement the aggressive subsidies that the
Biden administration has already passed on EVs, batteries, and critical
minerals in the Inflation Reduction Act. It’s often lost that the IRA
subsidizes EVs and their constituent parts in two ways — not only with
the somewhat
convoluted<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/ev-tax-credit-new-2024" target="_self"><u>
$7,500 personal vehicle tax credit</u></a>, but with the <em><em>more
important
</em></em><a href="https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/publications/the-ira-and-the-us-battery-supply-chain-one-year-on/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>45X
production tax credit</u></a>, which pays companies $35 for each
kilowatt-hour of EV batteries that they produce in the United States.
(There are similar 45X bounties for other manufactured goods, including
solar panels.)
</p>
<h4></li>
<li></h4>
<p>
These policies now add up to classic industrial policy
<a href="https://itif.org/centers/hamilton/#:~:text=The%20Hamiltonian%20agenda%20entails%20more,economic%20and%20national%20security..." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>in
the mold of Alexander Hamilton</u></a>: The U.S. is hiking tariffs on
high-value imports while subsidizing their domestic production, while
also providing cheap credit
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-13-jigar-shah" target="_self"><u>via
the Department of Energy</u></a> to companies that want to participate
in these new industries. The Environmental Protection Agency has also
issued
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/epa-auto-emissions-rule" target="_self"><u>new
rules</u></a> that will encourage U.S. consumers to buy from these new
domestic producers. The one element of the classic model the U.S. has
not yet adopted — except in some states — is provisioning cheap land and
easy permitting for new factories.
</p>
<h4></li>
<li></h4>
<p>
China, it should be said, followed a similar playbook to develop its own
electric vehicle industry. That should let us dispel with one foolish
idea right away: the premise that tariffs never work. On the contrary,
tariffs sometimes <em><em>do</em></em> work; as the economist Brad
Setser
<a href="https://twitter.com/Brad_Setser/status/1789875275959812167" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pointed
out</u></a> on the social network X, America only finds itself in its
current position because of how <em><em>well</em></em> tariffs worked.
Through a range of policies including tariffs and joint ventures, China
walled off its domestic market and encouraged domestic industry. That
industry has now grown to challenge the world.
</p>
<h4></li>
<li></h4>
<p>
But they do not always work. Another important aspect of Hamiltonian
industrial policy is <em><em>certainty: </em></em>To make
forward-looking investment decisions, companies need to know policies
that exist today will still be around when the production line starts
whirring. This China has in gobs, and the United States lacks. You may
have noticed that the front-runner in this year’s presidential election
is promising to repeal many of these policies that are now rolling out —
just about everything but the tariffs.
</p>
<h4></li>
<li></h4>
<p>
These tariff rates are unlikely to go down anytime soon. There is no
party in American politics advocating for free trade with China. The
choice, in the near-term, is between Biden’s vision of free trade with
democracies and developing countries, plus climate and defense-driven
industrial policy at the margins, versus Trump’s vision of fossil-fueled
populism that aspires to autarky.
</p>
<p>
There are forces within the country that wouldn’t hate to see a return
of more open trade relations with China — you can see factions within
the environmental movement, the Chamber of Commerce, and Big Tech
pushing for it, to name a few — but they do not control a partisan
coalition.
</p>
<h4></li>
<li></h4>
<p>
There is no equivalence between what the Biden administration announced
today and the
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/biden-sharply-hikes-us-tariffs-billions-chinese-chips-cars-2024-05-14/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>10%
across the board tariff</u></a> on all imported goods from all countries
that Donald Trump has proposed. Biden’s new tariffs focus on certain
strategic sectors that American officials believe the country must
cultivate to stay at the technological frontier, coupled with
pre-existing subsidies meant to spur domestic production of those goods.
Some of the tariffs only kick in beginning in 2026 — far enough in the
future, policymakers hope, for the market to prepare. Trump’s tariffs,
meanwhile, would intentionally and chaotically hike prices.
</p>
<h4></li>
<li></h4>
<p>
We’re only here because China has won Round 1 on electric vehicles. It
has created a thriving, competitive domestic EV industry that includes
the BYD Seagull, an $11,000 hatchback that gets up to 250 miles of
range; the Zeekr 009, a $70,000 minivan with more than 500 miles of
range; and the Xiaomi SU7, a sleek $29,000 coupe. As the car journalist
Kevin Williams
<a href="https://insideevs.com/features/719015/china-is-ahead-of-west/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
written</u></a>, China’s EV market is far deeper, more varied, and more
sophisticated than many realize. Beijing has built a Silicon
Valley-style industrial cluster that produces cheap electric vehicles
for the domestic market and the world — and the Biden administration can
do almost nothing about that.
</p>
<p>
This dominance has emerged out of China’s economic agglomeration and its
successful climb up the technological value chain.
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/27/opinion/gm-ford-electric-vehicles.html?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>As
I’ve written</u></a>, China once made textiles and toys; then it made
smartphones and computers; now it makes EVs and commercial jetliners.
This agglomeration of economic complexity is not an academic
observation; in many cases, the companies now producing China’s most
competitive EVs emerged directly from its electronics industry. Xiaomi,
after all, makes 15% of the world’s smartphones. CATL — now widely seen
as the world’s best EV battery maker — began as a spin-off of Amperex
Technology Limited, or ATL, which makes smartphone batteries. The iPhone
is, in a sense, the younger sister of the Chinese-made Volvo EX30: Both
are Western-designed consumer electronics that are made in Chinese
factories, through Chinese engineering expertise.
</p>
<h4>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li></h4>
<p>
Does one need to spell out precisely why American officials might care
about staying even vaguely competitive with China in the EV industry? Do
I need to mention the role that American-made motor vehicles have played
in world history? But the motorization of war — which has now gone on
for nearly a century — requires getting fossil fuels to the front lines
in dangerous convoys; by one estimate,
<a href="https://energypost.eu/u-s-militarys-mobile-mini-nuclear-fewer-fuel-supply-convoys-mean-fewer-casualties/#:~:text=Approximately%2018%2C700%20casualties%2C%20or%2052,with%20resupplying%20fuel%20and%20water." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
than half of the 36,000 casualties</u></a> suffered by American troops
in Iraq were on fuel or water resupply missions. Wind and solar are not
now so potent that they could liberate armies from these serpentine
supply chains, but energy technologies can drive surprising military
innovations anyway: In Ukraine and Nagorno-Karabakh, we have already
seen how
<a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-electric-bikes-war-russia-technology/31865559.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>e-bikes</u></a>
and
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/UKRAINE-CRISIS/DRONES/dwpkeyjwkpm/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>drones</u></a>
powered by small, lightweight batteries have transformed modern warfare.
</p>
<h4></li>
</ol></li>
<li></h4>
<p>
Perhaps this kind of thinking is premature, or too dire. Nonetheless,
<em><em>this</em></em> is what makes this moment so different from the
1970s, when Japanese-made cars changed the American car market, or the
1980s and ’90s, when the Korean brands arrived. For the first time, a
country outside the American security umbrella — a country that, in
fact, aims to compete as a geopolitical hegemon with the U.S. — has
attained the cutting edge of motor vehicle production. Even if Michigan
and Wisconsin were not so important in the Electoral College, even if
climate change did not require the rapid decarbonization of the global
car fleet, that fact alone would distinguish this moment from what has
come before. This is why the Chinese EV industry poses such a profound
challenge to American policy.
</p>
<h4></li>
<li></h4>
<p>
This challenge for the U.S. also requires conjuring an entire value
chain from nothing. A thoroughly classic Hamiltonian industrial policy
would involve reducing tariffs on commodity and low-value inputs, such
as the minerals that make up batteries, while increasing them on
high-value imports, such as completed batteries and cars. But China
controls so much of the critical mineral supply chain — it is
<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/chinas-role-in-supplying-critical-minerals-for-the-global-energy-transition-what-could-the-future-hold/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>“the
dominant player” in global minerals refining</u></a> — that American
officials feel like they must diversify; they must try to spin up low
value supply chains for graphite, lithium, and rare earths at the same
time that they encourage the construction of EV factories.
</p>
<h4></li>
<li></h4>
<p>
One of the most important aspects of the Inflation Reduction Act is that
it pursues two simultaneous industrial policies: In some sectors (EVs,
solar, batteries), it aims for America to catch up to its technological
rivals; in others (carbon capture, hydrogen), it aims to preserve
America’s pre-existing position at the technological frontier. Notice
what industries <em><em>aren’t</em></em> affected by today’s tariffs —
not carbon capture, not anything to do with fossil fuels, not even
anything hydrogen-related, even though China
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/will-making-hydrogen-green-depend-on-china/#:~:text=Despite%20emerging%20U.S.%20manufacturing%2C%20China,research%20firm%20Clean%20Energy%20Associates." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>makes
61% of the world’s electrolyzers</u></a>. (That is because the Biden
administration
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/hydrogen-rule-biden-clean-energy" target="_self"><u>has
shaped its hydrogen policy</u></a> so it does not automatically favor
the type of electrolyzer that Chinese firms make.)
</p>
<p>
It’s easy to get ahead of oneself here. Just because China has created a
superior EV industry, that doesn’t mean it will have one forever; just
because China makes better EVs, that doesn’t mean that America lags on
all climate technologies. But make no mistake: America is trying to do
something very difficult, and it has no guarantee of success.

id="judge-rejects-hunter-bidens-bid-to-delay-his-june-trial-on-federal-gun-charges">Judge
rejects Hunter Biden’s bid to delay his June trial on federal gun
charges</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WILMINGTON, Delaware — Hunter Biden’s federal gun case will go to
trial next month, a judge said Tuesday, denying a bid by lawyers for the
president’s son to delay the prosecution. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika rejected Hunter Biden’s request
to push the trial until September, which the defense said was necessary
to give the defense time to line up witnesses and go through evidence
handed over by prosecutors. </p>
<p>President Joe Biden’s son is accused of lying about his drug use in
October 2018 on a form to buy a gun that he kept for about 11 days. </p>
<p>Hunter Biden, who has pleaded not guilty, has acknowledged struggling
with an addiction to crack cocaine during that period in 2018, but his
lawyers have said he didn’t break the law. </p>
<p>His attorneys have argued that prosecutors bowed to pressure by
Republicans, who claimed the Democratic president’s son was initially
given a sweetheart deal, and that he was indicted because of political
pressure. </p>
<p>But the judge overseeing the case last month rejected his claim that
the prosecution is politically motivated along with other efforts to
dismiss the case. The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last week said
the case could move forward to trial. </p>
<p>Hunter Biden was supposed to plead guilty last year to misdemeanor
tax charges and would have avoided prosecution on the gun charges had he
stayed out of trouble for two years. It was the culmination of a
yearslong investigation by federal prosecutors into the business
dealings of the president’s son, and the agreement would have dispensed
with criminal proceedings and spared the Bidens weeks of headlines as
the 2024 election loomed. </p>
<p>But the deal broke down after the judge who was supposed to sign off
on the agreement instead raised a series of questions about it. </p>
<p>Hunter Biden was indicted on three gun firearms charges in Delaware
and was charged separately in California, where he lives, with tax
crimes. </p>
<p>He’s charged in the Delaware case with two counts of making false
statements, first for checking a box falsely saying he was not addicted
to drugs and second for giving it to the shop for their federally
required records. A third count alleges he possessed the gun for about
11 days despite knowing he was a drug user. </p>
<p>In California, Hunter Biden is charged with three felonies and six
misdemeanors over at least $1.4 million in taxes he owed between 2016
and 2019. Prosecutors have accused him of spending millions of dollars
on an “extravagant lifestyle” instead of paying his taxes. The back
taxes have since been paid.</p>

<h2 id="its-fun-to-do-silly-things">It’s fun to do silly things</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;I spend my time doing things online. I design and code websites for clients, I make websites for friends, and I start—and almost always shut down—all sorts of weird side projects. It’s easy to take this online life too seriously. If you go online you’ll immediately find people discussing business strategies and ways to monetise everything they do. Which is fine but also exhausting. The web is so caught up in the hustler mentality that it’s forgetting that some things can just be hobbies.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
I interviewed 37 people for my P&amp;B series at this point and if I’m
not mistaken, all 37 of them are just happy to have a blog they pay for
and have no plans to monetise it whatsoever. It’s a hobby, they enjoy
doing it and that’s absolutely fine.
</p>
<p>
In a few days, I’ll renew the domain for [theforest.link]. That site has
so far generated 0$. I spent around 50$ just for the domain at this
point. But should I care? Should I monetise this? Hell no. Carl and I
built it because it’s fun, because the idea of helping people discover
some new random wacky website is fun.
</p>
<p>
The other day I was doing some design admin on my
<a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale">Ko-Fi</a> because I wanted to
update a few of the graphics in there. And while I was doing that I had
this completely stupid idea of creating a new membership tier called
<em>The “I have F** you money” Club</em>. Do I expect anyone to actually
subscribe? Obviously not, I did it because it’s silly, because I hope
someone will laugh at the stupidity of it all. I did it because it’s fun
to do silly things.
</p>
<p>
Did you make anything silly recently? If you did show it to me! Send me
an email, I want to see it.

students end protest as school agrees to discuss Gaza conflict</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts — Protesters against the war between Israel
and Hamas were voluntarily taking down their tents in Harvard Yard on
Tuesday after university officials agreed to discuss their questions
about the endowment, bringing a peaceful end to the kinds of
demonstrations that were broken up by police on other campuses. </p>
<p>The student protest group Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine said in a
statement that the encampment “outlasted its utility with respect to our
demands.” Meanwhile, Harvard University interim President Alan Garber
agreed to pursue a meeting between protesters and university officials
regarding the students’ questions. </p>
<p>Students at many college campuses this spring set up similar
encampments, calling for their schools to cut ties with Israel and
businesses that support it. </p>
<p>The Israel-Hamas war began when Hamas and other militants stormed
into southern Israel on October 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking
250 hostages. Palestinian militants still hold about 100 captives, and
Israel’s military has killed more than 35,000 people in Gaza, according
to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians
and combatants. </p>
<p>Harvard said its president and the dean of the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences, Hopi Hoekstra, will meet with the protesters to discuss the
conflict in the Middle East. </p>
<p>The protesters said they worked out an agreement to meet with
university officials, including the Harvard Management Company, which
oversees the world’s largest academic endowment, valued at about $50
billion. </p>
<p>The protesters’ statement said the students will set an agenda that
includes discussions on disclosure, divestment, reinvestment and the
creation of a Center for Palestine Studies. The students also said that
Harvard has offered to retract suspensions of more than 20 students and
student workers and back down on disciplinary measures faced by 60
more. </p>
<p>“Since its establishment three weeks ago, the encampment has both
broadened and deepened Palestine solidarity organizing on campus,” a
spokesperson for the protesters said. “It has moved the needle on
disclosure and divestment at Harvard.”</p>

puts sanctions on Russian man, three companies for sanctions evasion
scheme</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The U.S. Treasury on Tuesday put sanctions on a Russian
citizen and three Russia-based companies it said were trying to evade
U.S. sanctions in a scheme that could have unfrozen more than $1.5
billion belonging to Russian metals tycoon Oleg Deripaska.</p>
<p>Deripaska, who himself was placed under U.S. sanctions in April 2018,
branched out into metals trading as the Soviet Union crumbled, making a
fortune by buying up stakes in aluminum factories. Forbes ranked his
fortune this year at $2.8 billion.</p>
<p>The Treasury said that in June 2023 Deripaska coordinated with
Russian citizens Dmitrii Beloglazov, the owner of Russia-based financial
services firm Obshchestvo S Ogranichennoi Otvetstvennostiu Titul
(Titul), on a planned transaction to sell Deripaska’s frozen shares in a
European company.  </p>
<p>Within weeks of this, Russia-based financial services firm
Aktsionernoe Obshchestvo Iliadis was set up as a subsidiary of Titul. In
early 2024, Iliadis acquired Russia-based investment holding company
International Company Joint Stock Company Rasperia Trading Limited
(Rasperia), which holds Deripaska’s frozen shares. </p>
<p>The Treasury said sanctions were imposed on Beloglazov, Titul, and
Iliadis on Tuesday for operating or having operated in Russia’s
financial services sector. It said Rasperia was sanctioned for being
owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act on behalf of
Iliadis.</p>

id="google-is-experimenting-with-running-chrome-os-on-android">Google is
experimenting with running Chrome OS on Android</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>Now that Android – since version 13 – ships with the Android
Virtualisation Framework, Google can start doing interesting things with
it. It turns out the first interesting thing Google wants do with it is
run Chrome OS inside of it. Even though AVF was initially designed
around running small workloads in a highly stripped-down build of
Android loaded in an isolated virtual machine, there’s technically no
reason it can’t be used to run other operating systems. As a matter of
fact, this was demonstrated already when developer Danny Lin got Windows
11 running on an Android phone back in 2022. Google itself never
officially provided support for running anything other than its custom
build of Android called “microdroid” in AVF, but that’s no longer the
case. The company has started to offer official support for running
Chromium OS, the open-source version of Chrome OS, on Android phones
through AVF, and it has even been privately demoing this to other
companies. At a privately held event, Google recently demonstrated a
special build of Chromium OS — code-named “ferrochrome” — running in a
virtual machine on a Pixel 8. However, Chromium OS wasn’t shown running
on the phone’s screen itself. Rather, it was projected to an external
display, which is possible because Google recently enabled display
output on its Pixel 8 series. Time will tell if Google is thinking of
positioning Chrome OS as a platform for its desktop mode ambitions and
Samsung DeX rival. ↫ Mishaal Rahman at Android Authority It seems that
Google is in the phase of exploring if there are any OEMs interested in
allowing users to plug their Android phone into an external display and
input devices and run Chrome OS on it. This sounds like an interesting
approach to the longstanding dream of convergence – one device for all
your computing needs – but at the same time, it feels quite convoluted
to have your Android device emulate an entire Chrome OS installation.
What a damning condemnation of Android as a platform that despite years
of trying, Google just can’t seem to make Android and its applications
work in a desktop form factor. I’ve tried to shoehorn Android into a
desktop workflow, and it’s quite hard, despite third parties having made
some interesting tools to help you along. It really seems Android just
does not want to be anywhere else but on a mobile touch display.</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>As Nintendo Switch unlocks and homebrew software develops, people are
inclined to explore the possibilities and whether or not they actually
provide a good experience. Our new prime example seems to be a full
install of Windows 11 Arm on the Switch. As noted by <span
class="citation" data-cites="PatRyk">@PatRyk</span> on Twitter, who
actually set this up, the experience is pretty grueling! The initial
installation took three hours, and even basic system tasks were
unresponsive. ↫ Christopher Harper at Tom’s Hardware Silly, sure, but
efforts like these all contribute to emulation efforts, which will
eventually be important once Nintendo drops support for this machine and
they become increasingly harder to get. Give it a decade or so and we’ll
need the Switch emulators to keep playing Switch games.</p>

<h2 id="biden-quadruples-tariffs-on-chinese-evs">Biden quadruples
tariffs on Chinese EVs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — In a bid to revive domestic manufacturing, President Joe
Biden announced Tuesday that he is imposing a drastic tariff increase on
Chinese electric vehicles and new levies on computer chips, solar cells
and lithium-ion batteries.      </p>
<p>“We’re not going to let China flood our market making it impossible
for American auto – auto manufacturers to compete fairly,” Biden said.
“I will do it by following international trade laws.”  </p>
<p>Tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, also known as EVs, will be
quadrupled to a 100% rate. Solar cell and semiconductor imports from
China will be subject to a 50% tariff, double the current rate. The rate
on certain steel and aluminum imports will increase to 25%, more than
triple the current level.  </p>
<p>The tariff increase will cover $18 billion in Chinese products.
Tariffs on EVs, steel and aluminum, and solar cells will take effect
this year, and next year for chips.   </p>
<p>United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the
administration has provided pre-notification to Beijing.     </p>
<p>“We have made clear this is not about escalation,” she said. “This is
about the consequences of decades of economic policy and the need for
the United States to defend our rights.”   </p>
<p>The move is designed to offset “China’s unfair practices and
subsidies and level the playing field for U.S. automakers and auto
workers,” National Economic Adviser Lael Brainard told reporters Monday
ahead of the announcement.  </p>
<p>“China is simply too big to play by its own rules,” she said. “China
is using the same playbook it has before to power its own growth at the
expense of others by continuing to invest, despite excess Chinese
capacity, and flooding global markets with exports that are underpriced
due to unfair practices.”     </p>
<p>China’s “forced technology transfers and intellectual property theft”
have contributed to its control of the majority of global production for
the critical inputs “creating unacceptable risks to America’s supply
chains and economic security,” the White House said.</p>
<p>Responding to the U.S. announcement, China said Tuesday the move
“will seriously affect the atmosphere of bilateral cooperation.”    </p>
<p>“The U.S. is essentially using the ‘overcapacity’ narrative to
kneecap other countries’ strong industries and practice protectionism
and trample on market principles and international trade rules in the
name of ‘fair competition.’ This is nothing but bullying,” Foreign
Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters Tuesday in Beijing.</p>
<p>Tough on China    </p>
<p>The move follows a three-year review of the policies of Biden’s
predecessor, Donald Trump, who is the Republican presumptive
presidential nominee. Both candidates have used their campaign events to
compete in showing who is tougher on China ahead of the November
election.  </p>
<p>“My predecessor promised to increase American exports and boost
manufacturing, but he did neither. He failed,” Biden said.   </p>
<p>The former president said Tuesday that the Biden administration’s new
tariffs will not be enough to compete against Beijing.  </p>
<p>“China’s eating our lunch right now,” Trump said, adding that Biden
should slap tariffs on “much more than electric vehicles.”     </p>
<p>“They’ve also got to do it on other vehicles, and they have to do it
on a lot of other products,” Trump told reporters as he entered court
for his hush money trial in New York.   </p>
<p>Asked by reporters on Trump’s comment about China eating America’s
lunch (unfairly taking advantage of the U.S.), Biden responded, “He’s
been feeding them a long time.”  </p>
<p>The Trump campaign hit back, calling Biden’s action a “weak and
futile attempt to distract from the grievous harm his insane Electric
Vehicle mandate is doing to the U.S. auto industry.”    </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>“The fact that these tariffs do not apply to gas-powered cars and
trucks but only to Chinese EVs shows that this has nothing to do with
protecting American Workers,” Trump campaign press secretary Karoline
Leavitt said in a statement. “It’s all about Crooked Joe’s agenda of
killing gas-powered automobiles while forcing Americans into
ultra-expensive Electric Vehicles they don’t want and can’t afford.”
 </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>Asked by VOA to respond to such criticism, Tai said the tariffs are
“designed to be strategic and not chaotic. They are designed to be
effective and not emotional.”   </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>Preempting future increases  </p>
<p>Currently, the U.S. imports almost no EVs from China, but the Biden
administration is trying to preempt potential future increases, said
Rachel Ziemba, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American
Security, or CNAS.  </p>
<p>The tariffs hit sectors where the administration has been investing
with industrial policy tools, including the Inflation Reduction Act and
the CHIPS and Science Act, Ziemba told VOA, referring to Biden’s climate
and energy legislation, and legislation to boost domestic semiconductor
research and manufacturing.  </p>
<p>“In a sense, these tariffs are part of a policy initiative to make
sure that Chinese companies can’t benefit from that U.S. government
subsidy,” he said.  </p>
<p>The move is likely to increase friction between the world’s two
largest economies and is not likely to change Beijing’s behavior.
   </p>
<p>“China opposes unilateral tariffs that violate WTO rules and will
take all measures necessary to defend our legitimate rights and
interests,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang said.      </p>
<p>Biden reiterated he wants “fair competition with China, not
conflict.” He said the U.S. is in a stronger position to win because of
the investments his administration has made to revive domestic
manufacturing.  </p>
<p>According to a 2022 report by the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, China spent more on industrial policy ($248
billion) than it did on its defense spending ($240 billion) in 2019.
 </p>
<p>China spends far more supporting its industries than any other
economy in the CSIS study, and more than twice as much as the U.S.  </p>
<p>Circumventing through Mexico </p>
<p>On the same day Biden announced the new tariffs, Chinese automaker
BYD, the world’s largest electric vehicle producer, unveiled the Shark,
a midsize hybrid-electric pickup truck, in Mexico. In February, BYD said
it was looking for a location in Mexico for its factory.   </p>
<p>A Mexico-made EV with sufficient North America-sourced parts could
qualify for tariff-free entry into the U.S. market under the 2020 United
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA. </p>
<p>The administration said Beijing’s move to circumvent tariffs via a
U.S. free trade partner is “a pattern” of “serious concern” that it’s
investigating. </p>
<p>With Chinese EV production moving out of China, taking action against
Chinese EVs in third country markets is something that the
administration should deeply explore, said Wendy Cutler, a former U.S.
trade negotiator who is now vice president of the Asia Society Policy
Institute. </p>
<p>Blocking Beijing’s circumvention effort can be done by amending the
USMCA or through supplemental agreements, or an investment screening
mechanism separate from the USMCA, she told VOA. “I’m sure there are
other alternatives as well that are being explored.”  </p>
<p>Tai would only reveal that addressing the issue will “require a
separate pathway,” without providing details. “I would just ask you to
stay tuned,” she said. </p>

<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>FERC announces new transmission rule
</h3>
<p>
There was quite a lot of news coming out of Washington yesterday. Here’s
a quick catch-up:
</p>
<p>
<strong>FERC overhauled transmission planning – </strong>The Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission
<a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VVN3FK3twK0XW3Yt1n45PfQNLW95j2m75f3FfnN1PJbv23qn9gW7Y8-PT6lZ3l6W2XtvsW6p92g5W4-fkLB3GWnwRW66MKrK67_MZRW7Y8T7529d3gPW6pt2R86d34SSW382-z43F3CJwW3sVq6d2nLZjlW6tYKW34MMXkXW86P6Q-4bv9QqW4bsb1780p_pjW3m09G73TP-_0W2B2W8-1RJt1WM1gLYNkMXDXW2c9y265dpWcXW5r4V6f4brNHhW6-Jmdn4b4P-gW5Q078K19-f4NW5vDcHk2BVRtLW22gRcD2wGkSDW8qwY0g3s8bV3W8b0_4t4cXsXqW7BN9sY4d3nw4N6YYSSFzRXKKW5kXz041Fdg_CW35CYVk95RRnbW87PJY46jGqQvf64nh3F04" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unveiled
and approved</a> a rule overhauling regional transmission planning to
take into account the ongoing and planned transformation of the electric
grid. As Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin
<a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VVN3FK3twK0XW3Yt1n45PfQNLW95j2m75f3FfnN1PJbv23qn9gW7Y8-PT6lZ3kRW2fk0g43mltyfW4skHj41tVy7DW7hLNJB57jY4nVLC0lg8XwSrnW5drlJw5WxrStW3QX_L22-7HchW6Qm_332F0hR2N4nLb3Cz9TQPW4BfNK56w_p5_W53nDcF47z78JW75vBZp4F7RldW1Vv9Zp2c4098W4yz-1N8qtyxlW6WvQbG2zf0N5W7VC1z18VcFkrW9jwp6n3dgrZmW8WJS7M6jcvnbW4YqZrV39qx16VN4hcb7GdVpqW5YSRPZ6X4yWyW31Zl5q7V3DF0W2dj2Zf93svG7VFmqm8859mkFN5NbcKqHsSN7W1Cg5Jx29bqqgW83H4GK1myLZdf78q9bW04" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a>,
the new rule will require regional transmission organizations adopt the
long view, extending their planning horizon over a 20-year period and
calling for updates every five years. FERC is also requiring regional
transmission planners to consult a specific set of economic and
reliability benefits like reducing congestion on the grid and resilience
against extreme weather and lower costs when selecting projects. And
transmission planners will have to come up with a default method for
allocating costs associated with new projects.
</p>
<p>
<strong>But Chuck Schumer downplayed the possibility of permitting
reform – </strong>The Senate majority leader
<a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VVN3FK3twK0XW3Yt1n45PfQNLW95j2m75f3FfnN1PJbvF3qn9gW95jsWP6lZ3pNN8MTBRfrssd1VtkdDh3qqv8sW4MftR19fKmhYW5Hy2Kk6VhZQlW9cNB5p6G638GW1BK4k12PqgYnW4817ZG3wCWjwW8ZqBwW1l9jNhN1BlVrQXRmlzW80NgsW90nNMbW6qX2h81mBJpwW99sCzD853GHgVMK70W5rJwRHW53JrSl4gZDqPW5CkB4Z1SSrtmW2SB-v32FQ3HQW6494nl6Td71jW9f7Ygp3dB5-WW2JhnBs44pvhwW44VjH-5hRFBTW7dMWD84BdzjtW2Y_3102N1fkyLXfxdXnLHZN4FSmRBZ0DWmW2106mT3Pyq6lW469McF259Dr4W2btfTR4h4j_bW6cwFPH17dvRcW8Y-QKV1N6fMKW3W8kK-29KQX5f8HnJn-04" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>
a bipartisan package to overhaul permitting reform and speed up energy
projects would be “virtually impossible” because Republicans have been
blocking the effort.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meanwhile, GOP attorneys challenged emissions rules – </strong>A
group of Republican attorneys general
<a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VVN3FK3twK0XW3Yt1n45PfQNLW95j2m75f3FfnN1PJbvF3qn9gW95jsWP6lZ3kRW7VTJJd80LYynW19gmhf2XLB20V9Q9qM15nh4XW44fFKL3hQgXYW28XV2t3fgFBpW7xfh0G6hJzwBW8yS7MW2qLXdJW90jD2j1_kpJFW6RZtQ86Dx2rXW4gt2Km5bQ_8YVtvH0K3RzLYxVlYx3X2gydqwW3SLmpM7HNHbFW2k_Yw98B_BYMW4G4pt58lL2D1W80vYln3dGrp4W8SPrxP2rR3gqW56rljW4yL4CFW2MM2fm8yfqlBW7ztQbg62M2pgM9qGWmmz9-fW8lZJpV6m99_QW5mLKDX1j0K1GW6sByvm18hdPpVKxy_2823J-0W2T_HNP8BTHRcW7HNfhP6-D6TZW8fPVwn3pMwftW8bkN_p1Hs_0BW5CQS1T8-B_LWf2smSG204" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">launched
a lawsuit</a> against the Biden administration over the EPA’s new
emissions limits for trucks, to be phased in over the next decade or so.
Another lawsuit targets California for its ban on combustion trucks set
to take effect in 2036.

shorter timeline. <em><em>Bloomberg</em></em>

yesterday that Tesla has started hiring back some of the Supercharger
team, including Max de Zegher, the director of charging for North
America. It wasn’t clear how many workers were being re-hired, but Meyer
noted that Musk’s philosophy is that “if you don’t need to go back and
hire back or build back 10% of what you cut then you didn’t cut deep
enough.”

<li>Vatican to host climate summit this week

The Vatican is hosting a three-day international climate summit,
starting tomorrow and ending on Friday. The event will focus on building
climate resilience worldwide through mitigation and adaptation. “We no
longer have the luxury of relying just on mitigation of emissions,” the
event

people can bend the emissions curve, survive the climate crisis, and
bounce forward to a safer, healthier, more equitable, and sustainable
world.”
</p>
<p>
The event will culminate in a protocol “fashioned along the lines of the
Montreal Protocol” that will “provide the guidelines for making everyone
climate resilient.” The protocol will then be submitted to the UNFCCC.
In written remarks ahead of the summit, Pope Francis said “the world in
which we live is collapsing and may be nearing the breaking point.”

At Rochester Regional Health in New York, aggressive collection

and learn more about its impact. But first, the Biden administration is
announcing increased tariffs on imports from China. And later, how can
the WNBA sustain its surging popularity?

<h2 id="ea-is-prototyping-in-game-ads-even-as-we-speak">EA is
prototyping in-game ads even as we speak</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>Electronic Arts has a long, storied history of trying to wring more
money out of gamers after they’ve purchased a game — now, it appears,
the company’s hard at work on its next generation of in-game ads. EA CEO
Andrew Wilson admitted as much on the company’s Q4 earnings call: when
an analyst asked about “the market opportunity for more dynamic ad
insertion across more traditional AAA games,” he said the company’s
already working on it. “We have teams internally in the company right
now looking at how do we do very thoughtful implementations inside of
our game experiences,” said Wilson. ↫ Sean Hollister at The Verge Ads in
games are definitely not new – we’ve seen countless games built entirely
around brands, like Tapper for Budweiser, Pepsiman, or Cool Spot for
7-Up – and banner ads and product placement in various games has been a
thing for decades, too. It seems like EA wants to take this several
steps further and use things like dynamic ad insertion in games, so that
when you’re playing some racing game, you’ll get an ad for your local
Hyundai dealer, or an ad for a gun store when you’re playing GTA in the
US. Either way, it’s going to make games worse, which is perfectly in
line with EA’s mission.</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog</p>
<p>Today illustrated that the Democrats have become America’s
cheerleaders, emphasizing how investment in the nation’s infrastructure
has created jobs and rebuilt the country. This week, the Biden-Harris
administration is touting its investments in rebuilding roads and
bridges, making sure Americans have clean water, getting rid of
pollution, expanding access to high-speed internet, and building a clean
energy economy, contrasting that success with Trump’s eternal
announcements of an “Infrastructure Week” that never came.</p>

public data file now available, featuring new experimental formats</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
This year’s public data file is now available, featuring over 156
million metadata records deposited with Crossref through the end of
April 2024 from over 19,000 members. A full breakdown of Crossref
metadata statistics is available
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/06members/53status.html">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Like last year, you can download all of these records in one go via
Academic Torrents or directly from Amazon S3 via the “requester pays”
method.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Download the file:</strong> The torrent download can be
initiated
<a href="https://academictorrents.com/details/4426fa56a4f3d376ece9ac37ed088095a30de568" target="_blank">here</a>.
Instructions for downloading via the “requester pays” method, along with
other tips for using these files, can be found on the

<p>
In January, Martin Eve
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/increasing-crossref-data-reusability-with-format-experiments/">announced</a>
that we had been experimenting with alternative file formats meant to
make our public data files easier to use by broader audiences. This
year’s file will be published alongside the tools that can be used on
the public data file to produce two experimental formats:
<a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/labs/packer" target="_blank">JSON-lines</a>
and
<a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/labs/dois2sqlite" target="_blank">SQLite</a>
(and a bonus
<a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/labs/rustsqlitepacker" target="_blank">Rust
version</a>). You can read more about our thinking behind this work in
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/increasing-crossref-data-reusability-with-format-experiments/">Martin’s
blog post</a>, and we are keen to hear your thoughts on these
alternatives.
</p>
<p>
Our annual public data file is meant to facilitate individuals and
organizations interested in working with the entirety of our metadata
corpus. Starting with the majority of our metadata records in one file
should be much easier than starting from scratch with our API, but
because Crossref metadata is always openly available, you can use
<a href="https://api.crossref.org/" target="_blank">the API</a> to keep
your local copy up to date with new and updated records.
</p>
<p>
If you’re curious about what you’ll get with the public data file, we’ve
also published a sample version so that you can take a peek before
committing to downloading the ~212 gb file. This file includes a random
sample of JSON files and is available exclusively via torrent
<a href="https://academictorrents.com/details/d47fbe29e5ef93a6695421f79a6efa4b801acff1" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
We hope you find this public data file useful. Should you have any
questions about how to access or use the file, please see the tips
below, or share your questions below (you will be redirected to our
community forum).

Tips for using the torrent and retrieving incremental updates
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Use the public data file if you want all Crossref metadata records.
Everyone is welcome to the metadata, but it will be much faster for you
and much easier on our APIs to get so many records in one file. Here are
some
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/tips-for-using-public-data-files-and-plus-snapshots/">tips
on how to work with the file</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Use the REST API to incrementally add new and updated records once you
have the initial file. Here is
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/tips-for-using-the-crossref-rest-api/">how
to get started</a> (and avoid getting blocked in your enthusiasm to use
all this great metadata!).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
While bibliographic metadata is generally required, because lots of
metadata is optional, records will vary in quality and completeness.
