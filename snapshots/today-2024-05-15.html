<p>The NetBSD project seems to agree with me that code generated by ‚ÄúAI‚Äù
like Copilot is tainted, and cannot be used safely. The project‚Äôs added
a new guideline banning the use of code generated by such tools from
being added to NetBSD unless explicitly permitted by ‚Äúcore‚Äú, NetBSD‚Äôs
equivalent, roughly, of ‚Äútechnical management‚Äù. Code generated by a
large language model or similar technology, such as such as
GitHub/Microsoft‚Äôs Copilot, OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT, or Facebook/Meta‚Äôs Code
Llama, is presumed to be tainted code, and must not be committed without
prior written approval by core. ‚Ü´ NetBSD Commit Guidelines GitHub
Copilot is copyright infringement and open source license violation at
an industrial scale, and as I keep reiterating ‚Äì the fact Microsoft is
not training Copilot on its own closed-source code tells you all you
need to know about what Microsoft thinks about the legality of
Copilot.</p>

Is Dominating the Carbon Removal Market ‚Äî But No One Seems to Care</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Low-tech carbon removal is all the rage these days. Whether it‚Äôs
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-4-enhanced-rock-weathering" target="_self"><u>spreading
crushed rocks on fields</u></a> or
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/vaulted-deep-carbon-removal" target="_self"><u>injecting
sludgy biomass underground</u></a>, relatively simplistic solutions have
seen a boom in funding. But there‚Äôs one cheap, nature-based method that
hasn‚Äôt been able to drum up as much attention from big name climate
investors: biochar.
</p>
<p>
This flaky, charcoal-like substance has been produced and used as a
fertilizer for millennia, and its potential to lock up the carbon
contained in organic matter is well-documented. It‚Äôs made by heating up
biomass such as wood or plants in a low-oxygen environment via a process
called pyrolysis, thereby sequestering up to 40% to 50% of the carbon
contained within that organic matter for hundreds or (debatably ‚Äî but
we‚Äôll get to that) even thousands of years. Ideally, the process
utilizes waste biomass such as plant material and forest residue left
over from harvesting crops or timber, which otherwise might just be
burned.
</p>
<p>
The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says
biochar could store about
<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport.pdf" target="_blank">2.6
billion metric tons</a> of CO2 per year. And by some metrics, this
ancient method of carbon removal is already leagues ahead of the rest.
Last year, biochar accounted for 94% of all carbon dioxide removal
credits that were actually fulfilled,
<a href="https://www.cdr.fyi/blog/2023-year-in-review" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according
to CDR.fyi</u></a>, which tracks the CO2 removal market. That means that
while corporate buyers are purchasing carbon credits that use an array
of different removal methods, biochar has thus far dominated the market
when it comes to actually making good on these purchases.
</p>
<p>
Some of the largest corporate buyers of CO2 removal credits have biochar
in their portfolios. Microsoft, by far the most prominent player in this
space, has bought over 200,000 tons of biochar credits ‚Äî part of its
quest to become
<a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>carbon
negative</u></a> by 2050 ‚Äî although that‚Äôs still a mere fraction of the
over 6.6 million tons of CO2 removal the company has bought overall.
JPMorgan Chase, which aims to match every ton of its operational
emissions with carbon dioxide removal credits by 2030, has bought nearly
19,000 tons of biochar credits, representing about 26% of its CO2
removal portfolio.
</p>
<p>
But despite its technical maturity, biochar has yet to generate the same
level of excitement or venture capital investment as more complex
methods of carbon removal such as direct air capture, which
<a href="https://www.cdr.fyi/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fdiob2hk5%2Fposts%2F3d77c407e2bfe33ea933979e0873d9b962c30aa0-1240x1282.png&w=1920&q=75" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>garnered
$142 million in investment last year</u></a>. By comparison, biochar
companies raised a cumulative total of $74 million in 2023. While that‚Äôs
no small change, it doesn‚Äôt compare to the amount of capital VCs and
other climate tech funders have poured even into other similarly
elemental carbon removal technologies.
</p>
<p>
For example, Frontier, a collaborative fund for tech companies to
catalyze emerging solutions in this space, recently announced a $58
million deal with Vaulted Deep, a startup that injects wet biomass from
food waste to poop deep underground. And at the end of last year,
Frontier inked a $57 million deal with Lithos Carbon, a company pursuing
enhanced rock weathering. This involves spreading crushed up rocks onto
fields, which react with the CO2 in the air to form bicarbonate; that‚Äôs
eventually carried out to sea, where the carbon remains permanently
sequestered on the ocean floor. In other words, it‚Äôs just an
acceleration of the natural weathering process, which normally takes
hundreds of thousands of years. VCs backing Lithos include mainstream
names like Union Square Ventures, Greylock Ventures, and Bain Capital
Ventures, while big-time climate tech VC Lowercarbon Capital led Vaulted
Deep‚Äôs seed round.
</p>
<p>
The questions around biochar‚Äôs durability ‚Äî that is, how long it can
actually lock away carbon ‚Äî are potentially unanswerable, and that‚Äôs at
least partially driving investor reticence.
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúBiochar falls in this very interesting middle ground - you create it,
and then it is constantly degrading,‚Äù Freya Chay, program lead at
CarbonPlan, a nonprofit that analyzes different carbon removal pathways,
told me. She said that we just don‚Äôt have the scientific know-how ‚Äúto
predict, really clearly, how much is going to still be in your soil at
100 years or at 1,000 years.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Frontier, for its part, only considers carbon removal ‚Äúpermanent‚Äù if it
can sequester carbon for at least 1,000 years.
<a href="https://www.biochar-journal.org/en/ct/109-Permanence-of-soil-applied-biochar" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Some
studies indicate</u></a> that a large proportion of biochar can achieve
this, but it‚Äôs hard to definitively prove, and we‚Äôre far from a
scientific consensus. Thus far the fund has steered clear of investing
in biochar,
<a href="https://gaps.frontierclimate.com/gap-details?recordId=recsPU8VIjuOO7LK3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>noting
that detailed protocols must be developed</u></a> to measure its
durability under a variety of soil and weather conditions.
</p>
<p>
Measurement, reporting and verification is often the downfall for
nature-based solutions (see: the hoopla around
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bogus
forest carbon credits</u></a>). And while it <em><em>is</em></em> simple
to measure how much of the carbon in biomass ends up sequestered in
biochar, ‚Äúit‚Äôs where you draw the project boundaries in terms of where
the MRV falls apart,‚Äù Annie Nichols, director of operations and project
management at Pacific Biochar told me. For example, one might want to
ensure that trees aren‚Äôt being cut down or crops aren‚Äôt being grown just
for the purpose of creating biochar, and this often falls outside the
scope of traditional measurement protocols. Pacific Biochar, for its
part, sources its waste biomass from forests in high fire risk areas of
California, where the excessive accumulation of woody debris poses a
danger.
</p>
<p>
Pacific Biochar
<a href="https://www.cdr.fyi/leaderboards" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ranks
as the world‚Äôs third largest supplier</u></a> of carbon removal, with
over 28,000 tons of credits delivered. Biochar ‚Äúgot a lot of attention
before there was actually much utility,‚Äù its CEO, Josiah Hunt told me,
referring to the period in the late 2000s when Al Gore was heavily
hyping its benefits. In his 2009 book ‚ÄúOur Choice,‚Äù Gore called biochar
‚Äúone of the most exciting new strategies for restoring carbon to
depleted soils, and sequestering significant amounts of CO2 for 1,000
years and more.‚Äù But at that time, Hunt said, ‚ÄúThere weren‚Äôt really
carbon markets ready to work with it yet.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Prior to 2020, Pacific Biochar‚Äôs revenue relied solely on biochar
fertilizer sales to farmers. It was only when the carbon credits market
picked up that the company was able to scale. Today, Pacific Biochar
sells most of its credits directly, as opposed to on an independent
exchange, though it works with the carbon credits platform Carbonfuture
to deliver credits to customers and perform the necessary verification
to ensure the company‚Äôs carbon removal data is accurate.
</p>
<p>
Pacific Biochar‚Äôs credits sell for $180 per metric ton, cheaper than
nearly all other removal methods and far below the weighted average of
$488 for CO2 removal. That‚Äôs because producing biochar via pyrolysis
requires much less energy than something like direct air capture. It‚Äôs
also a more mature process than most emergent nature-based solutions
such as enhanced rock weathering, meaning that comparably less money
needs to be spent demonstrating that the process works as intended.
</p>
<p>
A number of biochar companies told me they think biochar has been
overlooked in favor of more novel technological solutions. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs this
fixation on trying to find the high tech solution, the SaaS app that‚Äôs
going to solve climate change,‚Äù Thor Kallestad, CEO and cofounder of
Myno Carbon, told me. By comparison, biochar can seem like a relic of an
earlier era that never quite reached its potential.
</p>
<p>
Myno, founded by oil and gas veterans, is self-funding the buildout of a
large-scale biochar and electricity co-generation facility in Port
Angeles, Washington, which will source its fuel from the copious timber
waste in Washington State. It‚Äôs still in the initial design phase, but
the ultimate goal is to produce about 70,000 tons of biochar per year
alongside 20 megawatts of power. That amounts to about 100,000 carbon
dioxide removal credits, which Kallestad hopes to sell for less than
$100 per metric ton. Ideally, he said, the plant will serve as a proof
of concept that will help drive future investments.
</p>
<p>
While there haven‚Äôt yet been any major scandals in the biochar-sourcing
world, the BBC ran an expos√© in 2022 on a biomass-fueled
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-63089348" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>power
station in the UK</u></a> that was logging old-growth forests to create
wood pellets that were then burned for power. The company, Drax, had
previously claimed that it was only sourcing sawdust and waste wood.
While Drax maintains that its biomass is ‚Äúsustainable and legally
harvested,‚Äù
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-68381160" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>further
reporting indicates</u></a> that as of last year, the company was still
sourcing from old-growth forests. The worry is that something similar
could happen with biochar production as demand ramps up.
</p>
<p>
Chay says the cost-benefit analysis for making biochar gets even
thornier when taking into account the ‚Äúcounterfactual of how we
otherwise could have used biomass.‚Äù After all, biomass can also be
burned for energy, and if the emissions are captured and stored, that‚Äôs
a carbon removal strategy too. And with many looking towards
biomass-based fuels as a way to decarbonize industries such as aviation
and shipping, demand for waste biomass appears set to increase alongside
uncertainty regarding its best use case. ‚ÄúZooming forward to 2050, I‚Äôm
not sure there is anything such as waste biomass,‚Äù Chay told me.
</p>
<p>
But in the short-term at least, there‚Äôs enough to go around.
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/bioenergy/2023-billion-ton-report-assessment-us-renewable-carbon-resources" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>A
recent Department of Energy</u></a> report noted that ‚Äúavailable but
unused‚Äù biomass such as logging and agricultural residue could
contribute around 350 tons to the nation‚Äôs supply every year. That‚Äôs
about as much biomass as the United States uses for bioenergy today
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúCertainly biochar has a place,‚Äù Chay said. She‚Äôs not convinced that it
will ever make sense to conceptualize biochar production as ‚Äúpermanent
carbon removal‚Äù though. ‚ÄúMaybe we just let it be this kind of
interstitial durability. We figure out how to value that while also
optimizing for agricultural co-benefits.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
Investors may remain wary of a solution that occupies this
hard-to-define space between short and long-term CO2 removal, but Hunt‚Äôs
not too worried. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs horribly detrimental,‚Äù he told
me. He sees biochar‚Äôs strong performance in the carbon credits
marketplace as enough to sustain the industry for now. ‚ÄúI do think the
buying community is what drives our growth. And even if we‚Äôre not the
unicorns, even if we‚Äôre just the work mules, that‚Äôs fine with me. I
don‚Äôt mind being the mule of climate change action.‚Äù

<h2 id="jury-chosen-for-us-senator-menendezs-corruption-trial">Jury
chosen for US Senator Menendez‚Äôs corruption trial</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK ‚Äî¬†A jury was chosen on Wednesday to determine whether U.S.
Senator Robert Menendez broke the law in what federal prosecutors have
called a yearslong bribery scheme to benefit the governments of Egypt
and Qatar, as well as himself.¬†</p>
<p>Opening statements in the trial of New Jersey‚Äôs senior senator are
expected to begin later in the day before U.S. District Judge Sidney
Stein in Manhattan. The trial could last into early July.¬†</p>
<p>Twelve jurors and six alternates were chosen, including an investment
banker, a commercial litigator, a retired economist, a doctor and
multiple therapists. Jury selection took about 2¬Ω, and more than 130
prospective jurors were excused.¬†</p>
<p>Menendez, 70, faces 16 criminal charges including bribery, fraud,
acting as a foreign agent and obstruction.¬†</p>
<p>He is being tried alongside New Jersey businessmen Wael Hana and Fred
Daibes. The senator‚Äôs wife, Nadine Menendez, 57, is scheduled to be
tried on July 8, with the delay resulting from what her lawyers called a
serious medical condition.¬†</p>
<p>All the defendants have pleaded not guilty. The bribery trial is the
senator‚Äôs second. His first ended in 2017 in a mistrial after jurors
deadlocked.¬†</p>
<p>Prosecutors are expected to detail what they consider a complex and
sordid array of corruption that lasted from 2018 to 2023.¬†</p>
<p>The Menendezes are accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of
dollars in bribes from Hana, Daibes and insurance broker Jose Uribe, in
exchange for the senator‚Äôs providing political favors and aid to Egypt
and Qatar. ¬†</p>
<p>Prosecutors have said the senator promised to help Egypt obtain arms
sales and other aid, helped Hana obtain a lucrative monopoly on
certifying that meat exports to Egypt conformed to Islamic law, and
tried to help Daibes secure millions of dollars from a Qatari investment
fund.¬†</p>
<p>Menendez, a Democrat, also was accused of trying to interfere in a
federal criminal case against Daibes in New Jersey and in state criminal
cases involving two of Uribe‚Äôs associates.¬†</p>
<p>Prosecutors have said FBI agents found more than $480,000 of cash in
the Menendezes‚Äô home, much stashed in clothing, closets and a safe.¬†</p>
<p>Bribes also included more than $100,000 in gold bars and a $60,000
Mercedes-Benz convertible, according to prosecutors.¬†</p>
<p>Uribe pleaded guilty in March to bribery and fraud, and he agreed to
cooperate with prosecutors.¬†</p>
<p>While Nadine Menendez is not yet on trial, her husband‚Äôs lawyers have
suggested his defense might include an effort to blame her for
withholding information and making him believe his activities were
lawful.¬†</p>
<p>Robert Menendez became a senator in 2006. Before being indicted, he
would have been favored in his Democratic-leaning state to win a fourth
full Senate term in November.¬†</p>
<p>But any reelection bid now would be a long shot, reflecting recent
polls of voters that show overwhelming disapproval of Menendez‚Äôs job
performance.¬†</p>
<p>Menendez has suggested that he would try if acquitted to run as an
independent. Only 9% of voters polled in March by Emerson College
Polling/PIX11/The Hill said they would prefer him to another Democrat or
a Republican.¬†</p>

id="us-imposes-sanctions-on-nicaragua-over-repression-migrant-smuggling">US
imposes sanctions on Nicaragua over repression, migrant smuggling</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington ‚Äî¬†The United States on Wednesday imposed visa restrictions
on more than 250 members of the Nicaraguan government and levied
sanctions on three Nicaraguan entities in retaliation for ‚Äúrepressive
actions‚Äù and a failure to stem migrant smuggling through the Central
American country.</p>
<p>Senior administration officials told reporters that the officials
subject to visa restrictions included police and paramilitary officials,
prosecutors, judges and public higher education officials.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Departments of State, Homeland Security, and
the Treasury issued a joint alert to notify airlines and travel agents
about the ways smuggling and human trafficking networks are exploiting
legitimate transportation services to facilitate illegal migration to
the United States through Nicaragua.</p>
<p>‚ÄúActions by the Nicaraguan government are of grave concern. President
Daniel Ortega and Vice President Rosario Murillo have put in place
permissive-by-design migration policies,‚Äù the Department of Homeland
Security said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Nicaraguan government did not immediately respond to a request
for comment.</p>
<p>Increasingly migrants have been flying into Nicaragua and then
heading north overland to the U.S.-Mexico border as some smugglers have
promoted the route through social networks.</p>
<p>Many migrants in recent years have started their journeys in Brazil
or other South American countries, but flying into Nicaragua avoids the
often perilous journey through the jungle region known as the Darien Gap
on the Colombia-Panama border.</p>
<p>The administration of President Joe Biden, a Democrat, has struggled
with record numbers of migrant crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border and,
as he runs for reelection in November, voters have increasingly said
that immigration is a top concern.</p>
<p>Senior Biden administration officials told reporters on a Wednesday
conference call that sanctions would be levied against a Russian
training center operating in Managua since October 2017 that enabled
anti-democratic behavior and repression.</p>
<p>A press release from the Treasury Department said Nicaragua was one
of Russia‚Äôs ‚Äúmain partners‚Äù in Central America and the training center
provided specialized courts to the Nicaraguan National Police (NNP),
which the statement called ‚Äúa repressive state apparatus, carrying out
extrajudicial killings, using live ammunition against peaceful protests,
and even participating in death squads.‚Äù</p>
<p>In addition, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on two gold
companies it said were ‚Äúgovernment affiliated.‚Äù</p>
<p>Gold is Nicaragua‚Äôs top commodity export, the Treasury announcement
said, and ‚Äúthis action aims to degrade the ability of the Ortega-Murillo
regime to manipulate the sector and profit.‚Äù Reuters was not immediately
able to reach the companies for comment.</p>
<p>Migrant apprehensions on the border halved from December to March,
according to U.S. government data, in part because of increased
enforcement by Mexican authorities, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary
Alejandro Mayorkas has said.</p>

slaps sanctions on Sudan paramilitary commanders over Darfur
offensive</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington ‚Äî¬†The United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions on two
commanders of Sudan‚Äôs paramilitary force, vowing pressure to stop the
unit from an offensive on the Darfur city of el-Fasher.</p>
<p>The Treasury Department said it was freezing any U.S. assets and
criminalizing transactions with Ali Yagoub Gibril, Central Darfur
commander of the Rapid Support Forces, and an RSF major general involved
in operational planning, Osman Mohamed Hamid Mohamed.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe RSF military operation to encircle and besiege el-Fasher, North
Darfur, has endangered the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians,‚Äù
State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe stand ready to take additional measures against those individuals
and institutions that actively escalate the war ‚Äî including any
offensive actions on el-Fasher,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday also voiced alarm
over reports of heavy fighting in densely populated areas as the RSF
seeks control of el-Fasher, the last major city in Darfur not under its
control.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people have died, and millions have been
displaced since war broke out in April 2023 between Sudan‚Äôs army and the
RSF after their head generals refused a plan to integrate.</p>
<p>The United States has led diplomatic efforts to stop the fighting but
has seen limited success and leverage, with RSF commanders unlikely to
hold major assets in the West affected by sanctions.</p>
<p>The RSF and Sudan‚Äôs armed forces are seen as both wanting to secure a
battleground victory, and each side has received support from outside
players.</p>
<p>The U.S. special envoy for Sudan, Tom Perriello, is again traveling
around the Middle East and Africa this week in hopes of making
progress.</p>
<p>The United States has accused both sides of war crimes and charged
that the RSF has carried out ethnic cleansing and crimes against
humanity against the indigenous African-origin people of Darfur.</p>
<p>The RSF‚Äôs predecessor, the Janjaweed militia, carried out a
scorched-earth campaign in the arid western region that the United
States at the time described as genocide.</p>

<h2 id="gnome-os-is-switching-from-ostree-to-systemd-sysupdate">GNOME OS
is switching from OSTree to systemd-sysupdate</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>I‚Äôm pretty sure most of you are familiar with KDE Neon, the
distribution KDE maintains to provide easy access to the latest KDE
technologies. However, did you know GNOME has something similar, called
GNOME OS? It‚Äôs been around for a while, but has a far lower profile than
KDE Neon does, and it seems they want to change that and put more of a
spotlight on GNOME OS. GNOME OS is an immutable distribution using
OSTree, the same technology used by the various popular immutable
versions from the Fedora family. It seems GNOME OS is working to leave
OSTree behind, and move to systemd-sysupdate instead, which has been
available since systemd 251, released in May 2022. The developers claim
this will bring the following benefits: To complete the move from OSTree
to systemd-sysupdate, a few things need to be completed. First, the boot
process and root filesystem had to be migrated, which was done last
year. Second, sysupdate needs to integrated into GNOME, as for now, you
can only use it via the command line. This work is ongoing, and requires
a new D-Bus service and polkit integration to allow GNOME Software to
manage the update process. Of course, there‚Äôs more work that needs to be
done to complete this migration, but these are the main tasks. All of
this work is part of the project‚Äôs goal to make GNOME OS nightlies
viable for daily-driving for quality assurance purposes, and I‚Äôm sure
all this work will also make GNOME OS more attractive to people outside
of the developer community. It‚Äôs basically GNOME/systemd taken to the
extreme, and while that will surely make quite a few people groan, I
personally find it great that this will make GNOME OS a more capable
choice for everyone. That‚Äôs what open source is all about, in the
end.</p>

id="us-will-send-an-unofficial-delegation-as-taiwans-president-is-sworn-in">US
will send an unofficial delegation as Taiwan‚Äôs president is sworn
in</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON ‚Äî¬†The White House will send an unofficial delegation to
Taiwan this weekend for the inauguration of the island‚Äôs democratically
elected president, the Biden administration announced Wednesday, in a
move that is certain to upset China but unlikely to draw excessive
responses from Beijing as the two countries try to stabilize
relations.</p>
<p>A senior White House official said the move is in line with
longstanding U.S. practice to send the delegation ‚Äî which includes two
former senior officials and a scholar ‚Äî to the inauguration ceremony
Monday. Lai Ching-te of the Democratic Progressive Party will take
office, succeeding Tsai Ing-wen of the same party.</p>
<p>Beijing, which sees Taiwan as part of Chinese territory and vows to
seize the island by force if necessary to achieve unification, sees Lai
as a supporter of Taiwan‚Äôs independence and has long opposed any
official contact between Washington and Taipei.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn what ways the U.S. deals with the new Taiwan authorities on May
20 and afterwards will affect (the) cross-Strait situation and also the
China-U.S. relations in the future,‚Äù Liu Pengyu, spokesman for the
Chinese Embassy in Washington, said Tuesday before the announcement,
referring to the Taiwan Strait.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSo we urge the U.S. side to act on President Biden‚Äôs commitment of
not supporting Taiwan independence,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>The U.S. delegation will be in Taipei ‚Äúto represent the American
people,‚Äù the White House official told reporters on condition of
anonymity to discuss details of the trip before it was announced. The
official called Taiwan ‚Äúa model for democracy not only in the region but
also globally.‚Äù</p>
<p>Despite an absence of formal relations with Taiwan, the U.S. is the
island‚Äôs strongest ally and is obligated under a 1979 law to help Taiwan
protect itself from invasion.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs unclear how Beijing would respond to an unofficial U.S.
delegation at the Taiwanese inauguration, but ‚ÄúBeijing will be the
provocateur should it choose to respond with additional military
pressure or coercion,‚Äù the U.S. official said, adding that the
administration is not predicting how China would respond.</p>
<p>Beijing has repeatedly warned Washington not to meddle with Taiwan‚Äôs
affairs, which it says are a core interest for China because it is a
matter of sovereignty and territorial integrity. Beijing sees
Washington‚Äôs support for Taiwan as provocative.</p>
<p>The U.S. insists any differences be resolved peacefully and opposes
any unilateral changes by either side to the status quo. ‚ÄúWe do not
support Taiwan independence,‚Äù the administration official said. ‚ÄúWe
support cross-Strait dialogue.‚Äù</p>
<p>Taiwan has topped the agenda in U.S.-China relations, which have
soured over issues ranging from trade, cybersecurity and human rights to
spying. The Biden administration, in its competition with China, has
engaged in ‚Äúintense diplomacy‚Äù aimed at preventing tensions from
spiraling out of control.</p>
<p>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Secretary of State Antony Blinken
have recently visited China in the administration‚Äôs latest effort to
keep communications open and minimize misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Shortly after Lai was elected in January, President Joe Biden sent an
unofficial delegation to Taipei to meet Lai, drawing protests from
Beijing. Members of Congress also have traveled to Taiwan to meet the
president-elect. Plans are underway for a congressional delegation to
visit Taiwan shortly after the inauguration.</p>
<p>Beijing reiterated its claim over Taiwan immediately after Lai was
elected and said ‚Äúthe basic fact that Taiwan is part of China will not
change.‚Äù Days later, Nauru, a tiny Pacific nation, severed its
diplomatic ties with Taiwan, which now is recognized by 12 governments,
including the Vatican.</p>
<p>Since then, Beijing has criticized a U.S. destroyer‚Äôs passage through
the Taiwan Strait. The U.S. Navy‚Äôs 7th Fleet said the USS Halsey
‚Äúconducted a routine Taiwan Strait transit on May 8 through waters where
high-seas freedoms of navigation and overflight apply in accordance with
international law.‚Äù</p>
<p>Navy Senior Capt.¬†Li Xi, speaking for China‚Äôs Eastern Theater
Command, accused the U.S. of having ‚Äúpublicly hyped‚Äù the passage of the
ship and said the command ‚Äúorganized naval and air forces to monitor‚Äù
the ship‚Äôs transit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in a push to avoid Taiwan‚Äôs global recognition, Beijing
said this week that it would not agree to Taiwan‚Äôs participation in this
year‚Äôs World Health Assembly, an annual meeting by the World Health
Organization that could boost Taiwan‚Äôs visibility on the world
stage.</p>
<p>‚ÄúChina‚Äôs Taiwan region, unless given approval by the central
government, has no basis, reason or right to participate in the World
Health Assembly,‚Äù said Wang Wenbin, speaking for the Chinese foreign
ministry.</p>
<p>Wang also said Taiwan‚Äôs Democratic Progressive Party, which came into
power in 2016, has been ‚Äúhellbent on the separatist stance‚Äù of Taiwan‚Äôs
independence and that Beijing has ‚Äúsufficient reason and a solid legal
basis‚Äù to bar Taiwan from the global organization.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs the bipartisan delegation that the White House is sending to
Taiwan this weekend:</p>
<p>‚Äî Laura Rosenberger, chair of the American Institute in Taiwan, a
nonprofit, private corporation established under a 1979 law to manage
America‚Äôs unofficial relations with Taiwan.</p>
<p>‚Äî Brian Deese, a former director of the National Economic Council in
the Biden administration.</p>
<p>‚Äî Richard Armitage, a former deputy secretary of state under
President George W. Bush.</p>
<p>‚Äî Richard Bush, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution who previously served as chair of the American Institute in
Taiwan.</p>

We already know that last summer was the hottest ‚Äúon record‚Äù ‚Äì but those

published in the journal <em>Nature</em> looks further into the past and
concludes that last summer was the warmest in some 2,000 years in the
Northern Hemisphere. To reach this conclusion, researchers examined
thousands of tree rings, which
<a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/how-can-tree-rings-teach-us-about-climate?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_HTL0qv80xu6z2-aufQIIU9RvuHVrUZ9AF_X3pGd_w-k_JwBEOdLEUVyIeavPlnEjCzpGJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">offer
clues</a> about a year‚Äôs temperature and moisture levels. The tree ring
data suggests last summer was about 4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the
average temperature of the years 1 AD to 1890 AD. The study warns that
summer 2024 could be even warmer than 2023.

was fueled by man-caused climate change. In the Philippines, for
example, a 15-day heat wave pushed the heat index to 113 degrees

letters to oil executives from Cheniere Energy, Chesapeake Energy,

cultivate to stay at the technological frontier, coupled with
pre-existing subsidies meant to spur domestic production of those goods.
Some of the tariffs only kick in beginning in 2026 ‚Äî far enough in the
future, policymakers hope, for the market to prepare. Trump‚Äôs tariffs,

of the Hornet, a decommissioned aircraft carrier in Alameda, California.
It sprays sea salt aerosol particles into the air, a process that could
one day be used to brighten clouds and reflect the sun‚Äôs rays. This
experiment, which began in early April, marked the first time such a
device had been tested outdoors in the U.S. But the city of Alameda told
the scientists to stop their research until the health and environmental
impacts of the experiment can be evaluated. ‚ÄúThe city is evaluating the
chemical compounds in the spray to determine if they are a hazard either
inhaled in aerosol form by humans and animals, or landing on the ground

<p>NEW YORK ‚Äî¬†A sprightly miniature poodle named Sage was crowned ‚ÄúBest
in Show‚Äù on Tuesday at the 148th annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog
Show, winning the grand prize in the most prestigious competition among
pure-bred canines in the United States.</p>
<p>Sage, the finalist representing 21 breeds classified as non-sporting
dogs, triumphed over more than 2,500 top-ranked dogs competing in the
two-day contest, held at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis
Center in the Queens borough of New York City.</p>
<p>Sage, a 4-year-old black-colored female groomed in the fine, fluffy
topiary style traditional for poodles, competed head to head against the
winners in six other groups ‚Äî terriers, hounds, herding dogs, working
dogs, sporting dogs and toy dogs.</p>
<p>She was the first female to win the top prize at Westminster since
2020, according to commentators on the Fox Sports channel, which
broadcast the event live.</p>
<p>And she became the fourth miniature poodle to claim the top prize in
the 148-year history of the contest, with the trophy previously going to
her breed in 1943, 1959 and 2002, according to kennel club records.</p>
<p>The larger ‚Äústandard‚Äù poodle breed has been declared Best in Show
five times, most recently in 2020, and the smaller ‚Äútoy‚Äù poodle breed
has won twice.</p>
<p>The poodle originated as a hunting dog in Germany and is now
recognized as the national dog of France.</p>
<p>Sage‚Äôs handler, Kaz Hosaka, cried tears of joy and carried his prized
poodle in his arms around floor of the auditorium to cheers of the crowd
as he celebrated what he said was his 45th year participating at the
Westminster dog show and the last of his career.</p>
<p>The Westminster dog show bills itself as the second-oldest U.S.
sporting event, behind only the Kentucky Derby thoroughbred horse race.
This year‚Äôs competition drew a field of contenders representing 200
breeds from all 50 U.S. states and 12 other countries.</p>
<p>Mercedes, a female 4-year-old German shepherd, was named runner-up
for the overall contest, after first winning the top prize in the
herding dog group.</p>
<p>Along with Sage and Mercedes, the two other finalists chosen on
Monday were Comet the Shih Tzu, representing the toy group, and Louis,
the Afghan hound leading the hound group.</p>
<p>Rounding out the finalists were three group winners chosen on Tuesday
- Micah the black cocker spaniel, representing sporting dogs; Monty, the
giant schnauzer, leading the working dogs; and Frankie, a colored bull
terrier from the terrier group.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Transmission has been one of the biggest obstacles of decarbonizing the
power grid in America. In the past week, however, the country has taken
two big steps toward finally removing it.
</p>
<p>
Last week, the Department of Energy published a list of 10 high-priority
areas for grid development, called National Interest Electric
Transmission Corridors, designed to help accelerate some of the most
annoying aspects of the siting process. Then on Monday, the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission passed a new rule directing grid planners
to take a longer view on what America‚Äôs future electricity needs will
look like.

guests ‚Äî
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/gdo/person/maria-robinson" target="_blank">Maria
Robinson</a>, who leads the Energy Department‚Äôs Grid Deployment Office,
and Heatmap reporter
<a href="https://heatmap.news/u/matthewzeitlin" target="_blank">Matthew
Zeitlin</a> ‚Äî about what these measures mean for the Biden
administration‚Äôs climate policy and how soon we might see new power
lines get built. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding
executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a professor of energy
systems engineering at Princeton University.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Robinson Meyer:</strong> Wow. Okay. So basically, any ‚Äî so can I
just back up for a second? I think, first of all, I just want to go:
Wow. So all of, the whole power we‚Äôre talking about today is very
important. There‚Äôs nothing else like it in the federal government. But
also, you‚Äôre going to have to do a whole NEPA process on it?<br/> <br/>
<strong>Maria Robinson:</strong> Yes, so we‚Äôre going to have to do a
whole NEPA process for each one of these areas that we‚Äôre designating
for NIETCs. And then the other part of this is that if they access some
funding, they‚Äôre going to have to do another NEPA process. And if they
access backstop siting at a FERC, you may have to do another NEPA
process. And I know Congress is investigating a couple of remedies to
that.<br/> <br/> <strong>Jesse Jenkins:</strong> So that‚Äôs pretty
important. Because the goal here is to try to accelerate the development
of transmission, which is critical to tap into the best wind and solar
resources across the country that can help lower electricity costs and
help decarbonize the grid to meet the growing need for electricity.
That‚Äôs coming from data centers, as listeners have heard here on Shift
Key, from electrification of vehicles, hydrogen production, etc. So
we‚Äôve got a big pressure to increase the electricity supply in the
country. And, you know, the cheapest resources are renewables, but we‚Äôve
got to be able to plug them into the grid.<br/> <br/> So if this process
is going to ‚Ä¶ designating these NIETCs and then ultimately getting
transmission lines built out within them, with access to federal support
for financing and backstop siting authority, is going to play out over a
multi-year NEPA process ‚Äî or several of them ‚Äî how quickly could we
realistically expect to start seeing transmission lines built within
some of these corridors?<br/> <br/> <strong>Maria Robinson:</strong>
What‚Äôs great about the cohort ‚Äî and this is just our very first cohort
of those named national transmission corridors. We anticipate that we‚Äôll
open up applications again, maybe as soon as this fall, for another
round, as well, depending on how many we move forward with to do full
NEPA on. It really depends on our ability to get all of that NEPA done.
<br/> <br/> But some of these are really ready for prime time. Some of
them are just looking for some additional financing. And are looking at
construction dates as soon as, say, 2028, 2029, which in the grand
scheme of things for transmission is relatively soon.

id="administration-sending-1-billion-more-in-weapons-to-israel-sources-say">Administration
sending $1 billion more in weapons to Israel, sources say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON ‚Äî¬†The Biden administration has told key lawmakers it is
sending a new package of more than $1 billion in arms and ammunition to
Israel, three congressional aides said Tuesday.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs the first arms shipment to Israel to be announced by the
administration since it put another arms transfer ‚Äî consisting of 3,500
bombs ‚Äî on hold this month. The administration has said it paused that
earlier transfer to keep Israel from using the bombs in its growing
offensive in the crowded southern Gaza city of Rafah.</p>
<p>The White House has come under criticism from both sides of the
political spectrum in the U.S. over its military support for Israel‚Äôs
now seven-month war against Hamas in Gaza. Some of President Joe Biden‚Äôs
fellow Democrats have pushed him to limit transfers of offensive weapons
to Israel to pressure the U.S. ally to do more to protect Palestinian
civilians. Many Republicans condemn any lessening of military backing to
Israel.</p>
<p>The package being sent includes about $700 million for tank
ammunition, $500 million in tactical vehicles and $60 million in mortar
rounds, the congressional aides said. They spoke on condition of
anonymity to discuss an arms transfer that has not yet been made
public.</p>
<p>There was no immediate indication when the arms would be sent. It‚Äôs
not clear if this shipment is part of the long-delayed foreign aid
package that Congress passed and Biden signed last month, a tranche from
existing arms sale or a new sale.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal first reported the plans to move the
package.</p>
<p>House Republicans were planning this week to advance a bill to
mandate the delivery of offensive weaponry for Israel. Following Biden‚Äôs
move to put a pause on bomb shipments last week, Republicans have been
swift in their condemnation, arguing it represents the abandonment of
the closest U.S. ally in the Middle East.</p>
<p>The White House said Tuesday that Biden would veto the bill if it
were to pass Congress. The bill also has practically no chance in the
Democratic-controlled Senate. But House Democrats are somewhat divided
on the issue, and roughly two dozen have signed onto a letter to the
Biden administration saying they were ‚Äúdeeply concerned about the
message‚Äù sent by pausing the bomb shipment.</p>
<p>In addition to the written veto threat, the White House has been in
touch with various lawmakers and congressional aides about the
legislation, according to an administration official.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe strongly, strongly oppose attempts to constrain the President‚Äôs
ability to deploy U.S. security assistance consistent with U.S. foreign
policy and national security objectives,‚Äù White House press secretary
Karine Jean-Pierre said this week, adding that the administration plans
to spend ‚Äúevery last cent‚Äù appropriated by Congress in the national
security supplemental package that was signed into law by Biden last
month.</p>

id="republicans-advance-senate-candidates-in-west-virginia-maryland">Republicans
advance Senate candidates in West Virginia, Maryland</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ANNAPOLIS, Md. ‚Äî¬†Republican voters advanced strong Senate contenders
in Maryland and West Virginia on Tuesday, giving the party a big boost
in its push to claim control of Congress‚Äô upper chamber.</p>
<p>Former Governor Larry Hogan claimed the Republican nomination in what
will be a marquee race in Maryland against Angela Alsobrooks, a top
local official who could become the fourth Black woman in U.S. history
to serve in the Senate.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another popular Republican, Governor Jim Justice, won the
Senate nomination in deep-red West Virginia, becoming the overwhelming
favorite in the race that represents the Republicans‚Äô best pickup
opportunity in the nation.</p>
<p>In both states, which share a border but feature antithetical
politics, the Republican nominees represent a serious challenge for
Democrats in the general election as they cling to a 51-49 Senate
majority and defend seats in other states that former President Donald
Trump won four years ago.</p>
<p>At the same time, Trump and Democratic President Joe Biden sought to
project strength in low-stakes presidential primaries. And further down
the ballot, two people who were on opposite sides of the Jan.¬†6
insurrection lost their U.S. House bids ‚Äî a former Capitol Police
officer running in Maryland and a former West Virginia state lawmaker
who participated in the riot.</p>
<p>In all, three states hosted statewide primary elections Tuesday ‚Äî
Maryland, Nebraska and West Virginia ‚Äî as Republicans and Democrats
picked their nominees for a slate of November elections that will decide
the presidency and control of Congress.</p>
<p>Maryland</p>
<p>In Maryland, Hogan gives Republicans a legitimate chance at picking
up a Senate seat in the deep-blue state for the first time in more than
four decades.</p>
<p>Hogan overcame his years-long criticism of Trump, a position that put
him at odds with many Republican primary voters but will undoubtedly
help him in the general election this fall. Maryland voters gave Biden a
33-point victory over Trump four years ago.</p>
<p>On the other side in the Senate contest, Democratic voters nominated
Alsobrooks, the top official in Prince George‚Äôs County outside of
Washington. The 53-year-old African American county executive had been
endorsed by many of the state‚Äôs top officials, including Governor Wes
Moore, Senator Chris Van Hollen and U.S. Representative Steny Hoyer.</p>
<p>Alsobrooks prevailed after a contentious and expensive primary
against U.S. Representative David Trone, a liquor store magnate who had
invested more than $61 million into his unsuccessful bid.</p>
<p>Race was an issue in the Democratic primary and may be in the general
election in the months ahead. Alsobrooks is trying to become the first
Black senator from a state in which roughly one in three residents
identifies as African American.</p>
<p>On the social media site X, Hogan congratulated Alsobrooks and said,
‚ÄúVoters have a clear and stark choice: more of the dysfunctional
partisan status quo or real independent and bipartisan leadership.‚Äù</p>
<p>Alsobrooks, also posting on X, promised to ‚Äúdefeat Larry Hogan, keep
Maryland blue, and keep our Senate under Democratic control.‚Äù</p>
<p>West Virginia</p>
<p>Justice won his primary against U.S. Representative Alex Mooney in
the race to replace Senator Joe Manchin. With Manchin gone, the seat is
almost guaranteed to turn red come November.</p>
<p>Justice, a former billionaire with a folksy personality, is wildly
popular in the state. He also earned Trump‚Äôs endorsement. A former
Democrat, Justice switched to the Republican Party in 2017, announcing
the change at a Trump rally.</p>
<p>Mooney had tried to win over conservatives by labeling Justice as
someone who would support Democratic policies. Justice did support
Biden‚Äôs bipartisan infrastructure law, saying West Virginia couldn‚Äôt
afford to turn away the money offered in the bill.</p>
<p>West Virginia is also deciding its candidates for governor. Attorney
General Patrick Morrisey, the Republican nominee in the 2018 Senate race
against Manchin, is running for the Republican nomination. He‚Äôs up
against former state Representative Moore Capito, whose mother is
Senator Shelley Moore Capito.</p>
<p>Presidential primary</p>
<p>Biden and Trump have already amassed enough delegates to claim the
presidential nominations at their respective national conventions this
summer. Yet voters on both sides hope to register a significant protest
vote Tuesday that will demonstrate their dissatisfaction with the
Biden-Trump rematch.</p>
<p>Both Biden and Trump won their primaries in West Virginia and
Maryland.</p>
<p>Still, Maryland progressives especially unhappy with the Biden
administration‚Äôs support for Israel in its war against Hamas had
encouraged voters to select ‚Äúuncommitted to any presidential candidate‚Äù
instead of Biden. There was no uncommitted option in West Virginia or
Nebraska.</p>
<p>Everett Bellamy, a Democrat who voted early in Annapolis, said he
voted ‚Äúuncommitted‚Äù instead of Biden as a protest against the killing of
women and children and noncombatants in Gaza.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Trump‚Äôs Republican critics cannot choose ‚Äúuncommitted,‚Äù
but they can choose his former Republican rival Nikki Haley, who will
appear on the ballot in Maryland, Nebraska and West Virginia despite
formally suspending her campaign more than two months ago.</p>
<p>Derek Faux, an independent voter from Charleston, West Virginia, said
he supported Haley, and in other Republican races, he said he voted for
the candidates he believed were least like Trump.</p>
<p>Capitol attack</p>
<p>Tuesday‚Äôs elections also included two candidates who were intimately
involved in the Jan.¬†6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>In Maryland, former Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn was among
nearly two dozen Democrats running in the state‚Äôs 3rd Congressional
District. The 40-year-old Democrat lost to State Senator Sarah
Elfreth.</p>
<p>In West Virginia, a former member of the House of Delegates, Derrick
Evans, lost his bid to oust incumbent Republican Representative Carol
Miller in the 1st Congressional District.</p>
<p>The 39-year-old Evans served a three-month jail sentence after
livestreaming himself participating in the storming of the U.S.
Capitol.</p>
<p>Other key races</p>
<p>In Nebraska, Republican Senators Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts both
face nominal opposition in their primaries, one of the rare occasions
when both senators in a state are on the ballot at the same time. And in
Nebraska‚Äôs 2nd Congressional District, Republican U.S. Representative
Don Bacon faces a challenge from his right flank.</p>
<p>In North Carolina, voters finalized their pick of the Trump-endorsed
Brad Knott in what had become a one-person Republican primary in the
state‚Äôs 13th Congressional District.</p>

<h2
id="justice-department-says-boeing-could-be-prosecuted-in-737-max-crashes">Justice
Department says Boeing could be prosecuted in 737 Max crashes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON ‚Äî¬†Boeing has violated a settlement that allowed the
company to avoid criminal prosecution after two deadly crashes involving
its 737 Max aircraft more than five years ago, the Justice Department
told a federal judge on Tuesday.</p>
<p>It is now up to the Justice Department to decide whether to file
charges against Boeing. Prosecutors will tell the court no later than
July 7 how they plan to proceed, the department said.</p>
<p>New 737 Max jets crashed in 2018 in Indonesia and 2019 in Ethiopia,
killing 346 people. Boeing reached a $2.5 billion settlement with the
Justice Department in January 2021 to avoid prosecution on a single
charge of fraud ‚Äî misleading federal regulators who approved the plane.
Boeing blamed the deception on two relatively low-level employees.</p>
<p>In a letter filed Tuesday in federal court in Texas, Glenn Leon, head
of the Justice Department criminal division‚Äôs fraud section, said Boeing
violated terms of the settlement by failing to make promised changes to
detect and prevent violations of federal anti-fraud laws.</p>
<p>The determination means that Boeing could be prosecuted ‚Äúfor any
federal criminal violation of which the United States has knowledge,‚Äù
including the charge of fraud that the company hoped to avoid with the
settlement, the Justice Department said.</p>
<p>However, it is not clear whether the government will prosecute
Boeing.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Government is determining how it will proceed in this matter,‚Äù
the Justice Department said in the court filing. Boeing will have until
June 13 to respond to the government‚Äôs allegation, and department said
it will consider the company‚Äôs explanation ‚Äúin determining whether to
pursue prosecution.‚Äù</p>
<p>Boeing Co., which is based in Arlington, Virginia, disputed the
Justice Department‚Äôs finding.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe believe that we have honored the terms of that agreement, and
look forward to the opportunity to respond to the Department on this
issue,‚Äù a Boeing spokesperson said in a statement. ‚ÄúAs we do so, we will
engage with the Department with the utmost transparency, as we have
throughout the entire term of the agreement, including in response to
their questions following the Alaska Airlines 1282 accident.‚Äù</p>
<p>Boeing has come under renewed scrutiny since that Alaska Airlines
flight in January, when a door plug blew out of a 737 Max, leaving a
gaping hole in the side of the jetliner. The company is under multiple
investigations into the blowout and its manufacturing quality. The FBI
has told passengers from the flight that they might be victims of a
crime.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said they will meet on May 31 with families of passengers
who died in the two Max crashes. Family members were angry and
disappointed after a similar meeting last month.</p>
<p>Paul Cassell, a lawyer who represents families of passengers in the
second crash, said the Justice Department‚Äôs determination that Boeing
breached the settlement terms is ‚Äúa positive first step, and for the
families, a long time coming.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut we need to see further action from DOJ to hold Boeing
accountable, and plan to use our meeting on May 31 to explain in more
details what we believe would be a satisfactory remedy to Boeing‚Äôs
ongoing criminal conduct,‚Äù Cassell said.</p>
<p>Investigations into the crashes pointed to a flight-control system
that Boeing added to the Max without telling pilots or airlines. Boeing
downplayed the significance of the system, then didn‚Äôt overhaul it until
after the second crash.</p>
<p>After secret negotiations, the government agreed not to prosecute
Boeing on a charge of defrauding the United States by deceiving
regulators about the flight system. The settlement included a $243.6
million fine, a $500 million fund for victim compensation, and nearly
$1.8 billion to airlines whose Max jets were grounded for nearly two
years.</p>

<h2 id="the-new-apt-3.0-solver">The new APT 3.0 solver</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>A crucial but often entirely transparent feature of a modern package
management system like Debian‚Äôs APT is its solver ‚Äì basically the set of
rules and instruction on how to handle dependencies when installing a
package. APT is currently in the process of radically changing its
solver, the first bits of which can be found in APT 2.9.3, referred to
as solver3. Many of the changes and improvements get a little into the
weeds and will mostly be transparent to users, but there is one feature
the new solver will enable that many of you will be incredibly excited
about. One of the core new capabilities of solver3 is the implication
graph. As part of the solving phase, we also construct an implication
graph, albeit a partial one: The first package installing another
package is marked as the reason (A -&gt; B), the same thing for
conflicts (not A -&gt; not B). ‚Ü´ Julian Andres Klode Seems rather
innocuous at first sight, but here‚Äôs what the implication graph will
make possible: The implication graph building allows us to implement an
apt why command, that while not as nicely detailed as aptitude, at least
tells you the exact reason why a package is installed. It will only show
the strongest dependency chain at first of course, since that is what we
record. ‚Ü´ Julian Andres Klode If you‚Äôve ever dealt with packaging issues
‚Äì probably when running -testing or similar unstable distributions that
use APT, a command that tells you exactly why a package is installed is
an absolute godsend. Sure, aptitude exists, but aptitude takes you out
of your current CLI workflow, whereas this will be much easier to
quickly run. There‚Äôs more features solver3 will enable, but this one is
definitely one of my favourite low-level additions to APT in a long,
long time.</p>

<h2 id="google-details-some-of-the-ai-features-coming-to-android">Google
details some of the ‚ÄúAI‚Äù features coming to Android</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>Google I/O, the company‚Äôs developer conference, started today, but
for the first time since I can remember, Android and Chrome OS have been
relegated to day two of the conference. The first day was all about
‚ÄúAI‚Äù, most of which I‚Äôm not even remotely interested in, except of
course where it related to Google‚Äôs operating system offerings. And the
company did have a few things to say about ‚ÄúAI‚Äù on Android, and the
general gist is that yeah, they‚Äôre going to be stuffing it into every
corner of the operating system. Google‚Äôs ‚ÄúAI‚Äù tool Gemini will be
integrated deeply into Android, and you‚Äôll be able to call up an overlay
wherever you are in the operating system, and do things like summarise a
PDF that‚Äôs on screen, summarise a YouTube video, generate images on the
fly and drop them into emails and conversations, and so on. A more
interesting and helpful ‚ÄúAI‚Äù addition is using it to improve TalkBack,
so that people with impaired vision can let the device describe images
on the screen for them. Google claims TalkBack users come across about
90 images without description every day (!), so this is a massive
improvement for people with impaired vision, and a genuinely helpful and
worthwhile ‚ÄúAI‚Äù feature. Creepier is that Google‚Äôs ‚ÄúAI‚Äù will also be
able to listen along with your phone calls, and warn you if an ongoing
conversation is a scamming attempt. If the person on the other end of
the line claiming to be your bank asks you to move a bunch of money
around to keep it safe, Gemini will pop up and warn you it‚Äôs a scam,
since banks don‚Äôt ask you such things. Clever, sure, but also absolutely
terrifying and definitely not something I‚Äôll be turning on. Google
claims all of these features take place on-device, so privacy should be
respected, but I‚Äôm always a bit unsure about such things staying that
way in the future. Regardless, ‚ÄúAI‚Äù is coming to Android in a big way,
but I‚Äôm just here wondering how much of it I‚Äôll be able to turn off.</p>

Workstation Pro and Fusion pro go free for personal use</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>After Broadcom acquired VMware, there‚Äôs been a steady stream of
worrying or outright bad news for people using VMware products at home,
for personal use, as enthusiasts. The biggest blow to the enthusiast
market was the end of perpetual licensing, forcing people into
subscriptions instead. Finally, though it seems we‚Äôre getting some good
news. The most exciting part is that Fusion Pro and Workstation Pro will
now have two license models. We now provide a Free Personal Use or a
Paid Commercial Use subscription for our Pro apps. Users will decide
based on their use case whether a commercial subscription is required.
This means that everyday users who want a virtual lab on their Mac,
Windows or Linux computer can do so for free simply by registering and
downloading the bits from the new download portal located at
support.broadcom.com. ‚Ü´ Michael Roy on the VMware blog This is
definitely good news for us enthusiasts, and it means I won‚Äôt have to
buy a cheap VMware license off eBay every few years anymore, so I‚Äôm
quite satisfied here. However, with VMware under Broadcom focusing more
and more on the enterprise and squeezing every last penny out of those
customers, one has to wonder if this ‚Äòfree for personal use‚Äô is just a
prelude to winding down the development of enthusiasts‚Äô tools
altogether. It wouldn‚Äôt be the first time that a product going free for
personal use was a harbinger of worse things yet to come.</p>

<h2 id="ways-of-looking-at-bidens-new-china-tariffs">13 Ways of Looking
at Biden‚Äôs New China Tariffs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
The United States
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/14/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-action-to-protect-american-workers-and-businesses-from-chinas-unfair-trade-practices/" target="_blank">raised
tariffs</a> on a range of Chinese-made climate technologies on Tuesday,
including electric vehicles, solar panels, and battery components.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45236/thirteen-ways-of-looking-at-a-blackbird" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Inspired
by the poet Wallace Stevens</u></a>, here are 13 ways of looking at
them:
</p>
<h4>
<ol type="1">
<li></h4>
<p>
The biggest tariffs in the bunch are for Chinese-made electric vehicles.
The Biden administration has more than quadrupled them, imposing a 100%
tariff on all vehicle imports. That means that Chinese-made EVs now face
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2018/03/28/u-s-tariffs-vary-a-lot-but-the-highest-duties-tend-to-be-on-imported-clothing/" target="_blank">higher
tariff levels</a> than any other imported goods.
</p>
<p>
Right now, the U.S. imports relatively few electric vehicles from China,
and the few vehicles that we do import ‚Äî which are made by the
Chinese-owned brands Volvo and Polestar ‚Äî may not be affected by these
levies
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/how-volvo-landed-cheap-chinese-ev-us-shores-trade-war-2024-04-24/" target="_blank">because
of how imports are counted under tariff law</a>. (Neither Volvo nor
Polestar has commented on the new rates.)
</p>
<p>
What‚Äôs more, the White House
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/chinese-ev-cars-biden" target="_self"><u>suggested
in February that it would use national security law</u></a> to prevent
EVs from Chinese companies from coming into the United States at all ‚Äî
even if the cars were made in a country with which the U.S. has a free
trade agreement, such as Mexico. So despite the eye-popping headline
figure, the tariffs on Chinese EVs do relatively little to change the
decarbonization calculus in the United States. America wasn‚Äôt going to
import Chinese-made EVs before, and it‚Äôs not going to do so now.
</p>
<h4>
2.
</h4>
<p>
<strong></strong>While these EV tariffs may be more for show than
anything else, that is <em><em>not </em></em>true for the other tariffs
on clean technologies. Many of these categories already faced trade
levies imposed by the Trump administration, and Biden has now raised
them, effectively doubling down on his electoral rival‚Äôs policy.
</p>
<p>
Starting immediately:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>For lithium-ion EV batteries</strong>, tariffs rise from 7.5% to
25%.
</li>
<li>
<strong>For EV battery parts</strong>, tariffs rise from 7.5% to 25%.
(This closes a loophole in the Trump levies in which <em><em>completed
</em></em>EV batteries faced a much lower tariff rate than battery
components, encouraging automakers to import finished batteries.)
</li>
<li>
<strong>For many critical minerals</strong>, tariffs rise from zero to
25%.
</li>
<li>
<strong>For solar cells</strong>, tariffs rise from 25% to 50%.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The solar cell figure looks impressive ‚Äî and has been the source of
wrangling in the solar industry ‚Äî but it matters less than it looks. The
United States already imports
<a href="https://www.rechargenews.com/energy-transition/us-factories-under-threat-from-unprecedented-wave-of-chinese-solar-panel-imports/2-1-1604599" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
than 80% of its solar panels</u></a> from Chinese companies operating in
other Asian countries.
</p>
<p>
A second round of tariffs is scheduled to kick in in 2026. Even though
these hikes won‚Äôt take effect immediately, they may counterintuitively
matter <em><em>more</em></em>, because they affect sectors where China
now dominates the global industry. The longer timeline suggests that the
White House is trying not to disrupt the near-term market too much; in
effect, it‚Äôs giving companies a deadline to diversify their supply
chains. This second round includes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>For non-EV lithium-ion batteries</strong>, such as the type
you‚Äôd need for
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/texas-california-grid-batteries" target="_self"><u>grid-scale
batteries</u></a>, tariffs rise from 7.5% to 25% in 2026. These
batteries are already changing
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/05/07/climate/battery-electricity-solar-california-texas.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>how
the power grid works</u></a> and the White House may be loath to stop
the progress.
</li>
<li>
<strong>For natural graphite and permanent magnets</strong>, tariffs
will rise to 25% in 2026. China
<a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-new-graphite-restrictions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>refines
90% of the world‚Äôs graphite</u></a>, and it
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/graphite-batteries-trade-war-us-china" target="_self"><u>has
already tried</u></a> to use this as leverage in a trade dispute with
the U.S., imposing export restrictions on three high-purity grades of
graphite last year.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li></h4>
<p>
Whether you love them or hate them, you shouldn‚Äôt see these tariffs as a
standalone measure. They complement the aggressive subsidies that the
Biden administration has already passed on EVs, batteries, and critical
minerals in the Inflation Reduction Act. It‚Äôs often lost that the IRA
subsidizes EVs and their constituent parts in two ways ‚Äî not only with
the somewhat
convoluted<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/ev-tax-credit-new-2024" target="_self"><u>
$7,500 personal vehicle tax credit</u></a>, but with the <em><em>more
important
</em></em><a href="https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/publications/the-ira-and-the-us-battery-supply-chain-one-year-on/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>45X
production tax credit</u></a>, which pays companies $35 for each
kilowatt-hour of EV batteries that they produce in the United States.
(There are similar 45X bounties for other manufactured goods, including
solar panels.)
</p>
<h4></li>
<li></h4>
<p>
These policies now add up to classic industrial policy
<a href="https://itif.org/centers/hamilton/#:~:text=The%20Hamiltonian%20agenda%20entails%20more,economic%20and%20national%20security..." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>in
the mold of Alexander Hamilton</u></a>: The U.S. is hiking tariffs on
high-value imports while subsidizing their domestic production, while
also providing cheap credit
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-13-jigar-shah" target="_self"><u>via
the Department of Energy</u></a> to companies that want to participate
in these new industries. The Environmental Protection Agency has also
issued
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/epa-auto-emissions-rule" target="_self"><u>new
rules</u></a> that will encourage U.S. consumers to buy from these new
domestic producers. The one element of the classic model the U.S. has
not yet adopted ‚Äî except in some states ‚Äî is provisioning cheap land and
easy permitting for new factories.
</p>
<h4></li>
<li></h4>
<p>
China, it should be said, followed a similar playbook to develop its own
electric vehicle industry. That should let us dispel with one foolish
idea right away: the premise that tariffs never work. On the contrary,
tariffs sometimes <em><em>do</em></em> work; as the economist Brad
Setser
<a href="https://twitter.com/Brad_Setser/status/1789875275959812167" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pointed
out</u></a> on the social network X, America only finds itself in its
current position because of how <em><em>well</em></em> tariffs worked.
Through a range of policies including tariffs and joint ventures, China
walled off its domestic market and encouraged domestic industry. That
industry has now grown to challenge the world.
</p>
<h4></li>
<li></h4>
<p>
But they do not always work. Another important aspect of Hamiltonian
industrial policy is <em><em>certainty: </em></em>To make
forward-looking investment decisions, companies need to know policies
that exist today will still be around when the production line starts
whirring. This China has in gobs, and the United States lacks. You may
have noticed that the front-runner in this year‚Äôs presidential election
is promising to repeal many of these policies that are now rolling out ‚Äî
just about everything but the tariffs.
</p>
<h4></li>
<li></h4>
<p>
These tariff rates are unlikely to go down anytime soon. There is no
party in American politics advocating for free trade with China. The
choice, in the near-term, is between Biden‚Äôs vision of free trade with
democracies and developing countries, plus climate and defense-driven
industrial policy at the margins, versus Trump‚Äôs vision of fossil-fueled
populism that aspires to autarky.
</p>
<p>
There are forces within the country that wouldn‚Äôt hate to see a return
of more open trade relations with China ‚Äî you can see factions within
the environmental movement, the Chamber of Commerce, and Big Tech
pushing for it, to name a few ‚Äî but they do not control a partisan
coalition.
</p>
<h4></li>
<li></h4>
<p>
There is no equivalence between what the Biden administration announced
today and the
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/biden-sharply-hikes-us-tariffs-billions-chinese-chips-cars-2024-05-14/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>10%
across the board tariff</u></a> on all imported goods from all countries
that Donald Trump has proposed. Biden‚Äôs new tariffs focus on certain
strategic sectors that American officials believe the country must
cultivate to stay at the technological frontier, coupled with
pre-existing subsidies meant to spur domestic production of those goods.
Some of the tariffs only kick in beginning in 2026 ‚Äî far enough in the
future, policymakers hope, for the market to prepare. Trump‚Äôs tariffs,
meanwhile, would intentionally and chaotically hike prices.
</p>
<h4></li>
<li></h4>
<p>
We‚Äôre only here because China has won Round 1 on electric vehicles. It
has created a thriving, competitive domestic EV industry that includes
the BYD Seagull, an $11,000 hatchback that gets up to 250 miles of
range; the Zeekr 009, a $70,000 minivan with more than 500 miles of
range; and the Xiaomi SU7, a sleek $29,000 coupe. As the car journalist
Kevin Williams
<a href="https://insideevs.com/features/719015/china-is-ahead-of-west/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
written</u></a>, China‚Äôs EV market is far deeper, more varied, and more
sophisticated than many realize. Beijing has built a Silicon
Valley-style industrial cluster that produces cheap electric vehicles
for the domestic market and the world ‚Äî and the Biden administration can
do almost nothing about that.
</p>
<p>
This dominance has emerged out of China‚Äôs economic agglomeration and its
successful climb up the technological value chain.
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/27/opinion/gm-ford-electric-vehicles.html?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>As
I‚Äôve written</u></a>, China once made textiles and toys; then it made
smartphones and computers; now it makes EVs and commercial jetliners.
This agglomeration of economic complexity is not an academic
observation; in many cases, the companies now producing China‚Äôs most
competitive EVs emerged directly from its electronics industry. Xiaomi,
after all, makes 15% of the world‚Äôs smartphones. CATL ‚Äî now widely seen
as the world‚Äôs best EV battery maker ‚Äî began as a spin-off of Amperex
Technology Limited, or ATL, which makes smartphone batteries. The iPhone
is, in a sense, the younger sister of the Chinese-made Volvo EX30: Both
are Western-designed consumer electronics that are made in Chinese
factories, through Chinese engineering expertise.

<p>
Does one need to spell out precisely why American officials might care
about staying even vaguely competitive with China in the EV industry? Do
I need to mention the role that American-made motor vehicles have played
in world history? But the motorization of war ‚Äî which has now gone on
for nearly a century ‚Äî requires getting fossil fuels to the front lines
in dangerous convoys; by one estimate,
<a href="https://energypost.eu/u-s-militarys-mobile-mini-nuclear-fewer-fuel-supply-convoys-mean-fewer-casualties/#:~:text=Approximately%2018%2C700%20casualties%2C%20or%2052,with%20resupplying%20fuel%20and%20water." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
than half of the 36,000 casualties</u></a> suffered by American troops
in Iraq were on fuel or water resupply missions. Wind and solar are not
now so potent that they could liberate armies from these serpentine
supply chains, but energy technologies can drive surprising military
innovations anyway: In Ukraine and Nagorno-Karabakh, we have already
seen how
<a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-electric-bikes-war-russia-technology/31865559.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>e-bikes</u></a>
and
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/UKRAINE-CRISIS/DRONES/dwpkeyjwkpm/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>drones</u></a>
powered by small, lightweight batteries have transformed modern warfare.
</p>
<h4></li>
</ol></li>
<li></h4>
<p>
Perhaps this kind of thinking is premature, or too dire. Nonetheless,
<em><em>this</em></em> is what makes this moment so different from the
1970s, when Japanese-made cars changed the American car market, or the
1980s and ‚Äô90s, when the Korean brands arrived. For the first time, a
country outside the American security umbrella ‚Äî a country that, in
fact, aims to compete as a geopolitical hegemon with the U.S. ‚Äî has
attained the cutting edge of motor vehicle production. Even if Michigan
and Wisconsin were not so important in the Electoral College, even if
climate change did not require the rapid decarbonization of the global
car fleet, that fact alone would distinguish this moment from what has
come before. This is why the Chinese EV industry poses such a profound
challenge to American policy.
</p>
<h4></li>
<li></h4>
<p>
This challenge for the U.S. also requires conjuring an entire value
chain from nothing. A thoroughly classic Hamiltonian industrial policy
would involve reducing tariffs on commodity and low-value inputs, such
as the minerals that make up batteries, while increasing them on
high-value imports, such as completed batteries and cars. But China
controls so much of the critical mineral supply chain ‚Äî it is
<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/chinas-role-in-supplying-critical-minerals-for-the-global-energy-transition-what-could-the-future-hold/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>‚Äúthe
dominant player‚Äù in global minerals refining</u></a> ‚Äî that American
officials feel like they must diversify; they must try to spin up low
value supply chains for graphite, lithium, and rare earths at the same
time that they encourage the construction of EV factories.
</p>
<h4></li>
<li></h4>
<p>
One of the most important aspects of the Inflation Reduction Act is that
it pursues two simultaneous industrial policies: In some sectors (EVs,
solar, batteries), it aims for America to catch up to its technological
rivals; in others (carbon capture, hydrogen), it aims to preserve
America‚Äôs pre-existing position at the technological frontier. Notice
what industries <em><em>aren‚Äôt</em></em> affected by today‚Äôs tariffs ‚Äî
not carbon capture, not anything to do with fossil fuels, not even
anything hydrogen-related, even though China
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/will-making-hydrogen-green-depend-on-china/#:~:text=Despite%20emerging%20U.S.%20manufacturing%2C%20China,research%20firm%20Clean%20Energy%20Associates." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>makes
61% of the world‚Äôs electrolyzers</u></a>. (That is because the Biden
administration
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/hydrogen-rule-biden-clean-energy" target="_self"><u>has
shaped its hydrogen policy</u></a> so it does not automatically favor
the type of electrolyzer that Chinese firms make.)
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs easy to get ahead of oneself here. Just because China has created a
superior EV industry, that doesn‚Äôt mean it will have one forever; just
because China makes better EVs, that doesn‚Äôt mean that America lags on
all climate technologies. But make no mistake: America is trying to do
something very difficult, and it has no guarantee of success.

rejects Hunter Biden‚Äôs bid to delay his June trial on federal gun
charges</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WILMINGTON, Delaware ‚Äî¬†Hunter Biden‚Äôs federal gun case will go to
trial next month, a judge said Tuesday, denying a bid by lawyers for the
president‚Äôs son to delay the prosecution.¬†</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika rejected Hunter Biden‚Äôs request
to push the trial until September, which the defense said was necessary
to give the defense time to line up witnesses and go through evidence
handed over by prosecutors.¬†</p>
<p>President Joe Biden‚Äôs son is accused of lying about his drug use in
October 2018 on a form to buy a gun that he kept for about 11 days.¬†</p>
<p>Hunter Biden, who has pleaded not guilty, has acknowledged struggling
with an addiction to crack cocaine during that period in 2018, but his
lawyers have said he didn‚Äôt break the law.¬†</p>
<p>His attorneys have argued that prosecutors bowed to pressure by
Republicans, who claimed the Democratic president‚Äôs son was initially
given a sweetheart deal, and that he was indicted because of political
pressure.¬†</p>
<p>But the judge overseeing the case last month rejected his claim that
the prosecution is politically motivated along with other efforts to
dismiss the case. The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last week said
the case could move forward to trial.¬†</p>
<p>Hunter Biden was supposed to plead guilty last year to misdemeanor
tax charges and would have avoided prosecution on the gun charges had he
stayed out of trouble for two years. It was the culmination of a
yearslong investigation by federal prosecutors into the business
dealings of the president‚Äôs son, and the agreement would have dispensed
with criminal proceedings and spared the Bidens weeks of headlines as
the 2024 election loomed.¬†</p>
<p>But the deal broke down after the judge who was supposed to sign off
on the agreement instead raised a series of questions about it.¬†</p>
<p>Hunter Biden was indicted on three gun firearms charges in Delaware
and was charged separately in California, where he lives, with tax
crimes.¬†</p>
<p>He‚Äôs charged in the Delaware case with two counts of making false
statements, first for checking a box falsely saying he was not addicted
to drugs and second for giving it to the shop for their federally
required records. A third count alleges he possessed the gun for about
11 days despite knowing he was a drug user.¬†</p>
<p>In California, Hunter Biden is charged with three felonies and six
misdemeanors over at least $1.4 million in taxes he owed between 2016
and 2019. Prosecutors have accused him of spending millions of dollars
on an ‚Äúextravagant lifestyle‚Äù instead of paying his taxes. The back
taxes have since been paid.</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>        &lt;p&gt;I spend my time doing things online. I design and code websites for clients, I make websites for friends, and I start‚Äîand almost always shut down‚Äîall sorts of weird side projects. It‚Äôs easy to take this online life too seriously. If you go online you‚Äôll immediately find people discussing business strategies and ways to monetise everything they do. Which is fine but also exhausting. The web is so caught up in the hustler mentality that it‚Äôs forgetting that some things can just be hobbies.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
I interviewed 37 people for my P&amp;B series at this point and if I‚Äôm
not mistaken, all 37 of them are just happy to have a blog they pay for
and have no plans to monetise it whatsoever. It‚Äôs a hobby, they enjoy
doing it and that‚Äôs absolutely fine.

In a few days, I‚Äôll renew the domain for [theforest.link]. That site has
so far generated 0$. I spent around 50$ just for the domain at this
point. But should I care? Should I monetise this? Hell no. Carl and I
built it because it‚Äôs fun, because the idea of helping people discover
some new random wacky website is fun.

someone will laugh at the stupidity of it all. I did it because it‚Äôs fun

students end protest as school agrees to discuss Gaza conflict</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts ‚Äî¬†Protesters against the war between Israel
and Hamas were voluntarily taking down their tents in Harvard Yard on
Tuesday after university officials agreed to discuss their questions
about the endowment, bringing a peaceful end to the kinds of
demonstrations that were broken up by police on other campuses.¬†</p>
<p>The student protest group Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine said in a
statement that the encampment ‚Äúoutlasted its utility with respect to our
demands.‚Äù Meanwhile, Harvard University interim President Alan Garber
agreed to pursue a meeting between protesters and university officials
regarding the students‚Äô questions.¬†</p>
<p>Students at many college campuses this spring set up similar
encampments, calling for their schools to cut ties with Israel and
businesses that support it.¬†</p>
<p>The Israel-Hamas war began when Hamas and other militants stormed
into southern Israel on October 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking
250 hostages. Palestinian militants still hold about 100 captives, and
Israel‚Äôs military has killed more than 35,000 people in Gaza, according
to Gaza‚Äôs Health Ministry, which doesn‚Äôt distinguish between civilians
and combatants.¬†</p>
<p>Harvard said its president and the dean of the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences, Hopi Hoekstra, will meet with the protesters to discuss the
conflict in the Middle East.¬†</p>
<p>The protesters said they worked out an agreement to meet with
university officials, including the Harvard Management Company, which
oversees the world‚Äôs largest academic endowment, valued at about $50
billion.¬†</p>
<p>The protesters‚Äô statement said the students will set an agenda that
includes discussions on disclosure, divestment, reinvestment and the
creation of a Center for Palestine Studies. The students also said that
Harvard has offered to retract suspensions of more than 20 students and
student workers and back down on disciplinary measures faced by 60
more.¬†</p>
<p>‚ÄúSince its establishment three weeks ago, the encampment has both
broadened and deepened Palestine solidarity organizing on campus,‚Äù a
spokesperson for the protesters said. ‚ÄúIt has moved the needle on
disclosure and divestment at Harvard.‚Äù</p>

puts sanctions on Russian man, three companies for sanctions evasion
scheme</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington ‚Äî¬†The U.S. Treasury on Tuesday put sanctions on a Russian
citizen and three Russia-based companies it said were trying to evade
U.S. sanctions in a scheme that could have unfrozen more than $1.5
billion belonging to Russian metals tycoon Oleg Deripaska.</p>
<p>Deripaska, who himself was placed under U.S. sanctions in April 2018,
branched out into metals trading as the Soviet Union crumbled, making a
fortune by buying up stakes in aluminum factories. Forbes ranked his
fortune this year at $2.8 billion.</p>
<p>The Treasury said that in June 2023 Deripaska coordinated with
Russian citizens Dmitrii Beloglazov, the owner of Russia-based financial
services firm Obshchestvo S Ogranichennoi Otvetstvennostiu Titul
(Titul), on a planned transaction to sell Deripaska‚Äôs frozen shares in a
European company. ¬†</p>
<p>Within weeks of this, Russia-based financial services firm
Aktsionernoe Obshchestvo Iliadis was set up as a subsidiary of Titul. In
early 2024, Iliadis acquired Russia-based investment holding company
International Company Joint Stock Company Rasperia Trading Limited
(Rasperia), which holds Deripaska‚Äôs frozen shares.¬†</p>
<p>The Treasury said sanctions were imposed on Beloglazov, Titul, and
Iliadis on Tuesday for operating or having operated in Russia‚Äôs
financial services sector. It said Rasperia was sanctioned for being
owned or controlled by, or having acted or purported to act on behalf of
Iliadis.</p>

id="google-is-experimenting-with-running-chrome-os-on-android">Google is
experimenting with running Chrome OS on Android</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>Now that Android ‚Äì since version 13 ‚Äì ships with the Android
Virtualisation Framework, Google can start doing interesting things with
it. It turns out the first interesting thing Google wants do with it is
run Chrome OS inside of it. Even though AVF was initially designed
around running small workloads in a highly stripped-down build of
Android loaded in an isolated virtual machine, there‚Äôs technically no
reason it can‚Äôt be used to run other operating systems. As a matter of
fact, this was demonstrated already when developer Danny Lin got Windows
11 running on an Android phone back in 2022. Google itself never
officially provided support for running anything other than its custom
build of Android called ‚Äúmicrodroid‚Äù in AVF, but that‚Äôs no longer the
case. The company has started to offer official support for running
Chromium OS, the open-source version of Chrome OS, on Android phones
through AVF, and it has even been privately demoing this to other
companies. At a privately held event, Google recently demonstrated a
special build of Chromium OS ‚Äî code-named ‚Äúferrochrome‚Äù ‚Äî running in a
virtual machine on a Pixel 8. However, Chromium OS wasn‚Äôt shown running
on the phone‚Äôs screen itself. Rather, it was projected to an external
display, which is possible because Google recently enabled display
output on its Pixel 8 series. Time will tell if Google is thinking of
positioning Chrome OS as a platform for its desktop mode ambitions and
Samsung DeX rival. ‚Ü´ Mishaal Rahman at Android Authority It seems that
Google is in the phase of exploring if there are any OEMs interested in
allowing users to plug their Android phone into an external display and
input devices and run Chrome OS on it. This sounds like an interesting
approach to the longstanding dream of convergence ‚Äì one device for all
your computing needs ‚Äì but at the same time, it feels quite convoluted
to have your Android device emulate an entire Chrome OS installation.
What a damning condemnation of Android as a platform that despite years
of trying, Google just can‚Äôt seem to make Android and its applications
work in a desktop form factor. I‚Äôve tried to shoehorn Android into a
desktop workflow, and it‚Äôs quite hard, despite third parties having made
some interesting tools to help you along. It really seems Android just
does not want to be anywhere else but on a mobile touch display.</p>

hacked to run Windows 11 on Arm</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>As Nintendo Switch unlocks and homebrew software develops, people are
inclined to explore the possibilities and whether or not they actually
provide a good experience. Our new prime example seems to be a full
install of Windows 11 Arm on the Switch. As noted by <span
class="citation" data-cites="PatRyk">@PatRyk</span> on Twitter, who
actually set this up, the experience is pretty grueling! The initial
installation took three hours, and even basic system tasks were
unresponsive. ‚Ü´ Christopher Harper at Tom‚Äôs Hardware Silly, sure, but
efforts like these all contribute to emulation efforts, which will
eventually be important once Nintendo drops support for this machine and
they become increasingly harder to get. Give it a decade or so and we‚Äôll
need the Switch emulators to keep playing Switch games.</p>

<h2 id="biden-quadruples-tariffs-on-chinese-evs">Biden quadruples
tariffs on Chinese EVs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON ‚Äî¬†In a bid to revive domestic manufacturing, President Joe
Biden announced Tuesday that he is imposing a drastic tariff increase on
Chinese electric vehicles and new levies on computer chips, solar cells
and lithium-ion batteries. ¬†¬†¬† ¬†</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to let China flood our market making it impossible
for American auto ‚Äì auto manufacturers to compete fairly,‚Äù Biden said.
‚ÄúI will do it by following international trade laws.‚Äù ¬†</p>
<p>Tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, also known as EVs, will be
quadrupled to a 100% rate. Solar cell and semiconductor imports from
China will be subject to a 50% tariff, double the current rate. The rate
on certain steel and aluminum imports will increase to 25%, more than
triple the current level. ¬†</p>
<p>The tariff increase will cover $18 billion in Chinese products.
Tariffs on EVs, steel and aluminum, and solar cells will take effect
this year, and next year for chips. ¬†¬†</p>
<p>United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the
administration has provided pre-notification to Beijing. ¬†¬†¬†¬†</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe have made clear this is not about escalation,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThis is
about the consequences of decades of economic policy and the need for
the United States to defend our rights.‚Äù ¬†¬†</p>
<p>The move is designed to offset ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs unfair practices and
subsidies and level the playing field for U.S. automakers and auto
workers,‚Äù National Economic Adviser Lael Brainard told reporters Monday
ahead of the announcement. ¬†</p>
<p>‚ÄúChina is simply too big to play by its own rules,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúChina
is using the same playbook it has before to power its own growth at the
expense of others by continuing to invest, despite excess Chinese
capacity, and flooding global markets with exports that are underpriced
due to unfair practices.‚Äù ¬†¬† ¬†</p>
<p>China‚Äôs ‚Äúforced technology transfers and intellectual property theft‚Äù
have contributed to its control of the majority of global production for
the critical inputs ‚Äúcreating unacceptable risks to America‚Äôs supply
chains and economic security,‚Äù the White House said.</p>
<p>Responding to the U.S. announcement, China said Tuesday the move
‚Äúwill seriously affect the atmosphere of bilateral cooperation.‚Äù ¬† ¬†</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe U.S. is essentially using the ‚Äòovercapacity‚Äô narrative to
kneecap other countries‚Äô strong industries and practice protectionism
and trample on market principles and international trade rules in the
name of ‚Äòfair competition.‚Äô This is nothing but bullying,‚Äù Foreign
Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters Tuesday in Beijing.</p>
<p>Tough on China ¬†¬†¬†</p>
<p>The move follows a three-year review of the policies of Biden‚Äôs
predecessor, Donald Trump, who is the Republican presumptive
presidential nominee. Both candidates have used their campaign events to
compete in showing who is tougher on China ahead of the November
election. ¬†</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy predecessor promised to increase American exports and boost
manufacturing, but he did neither. He failed,‚Äù Biden said. ¬†¬†</p>
<p>The former president said Tuesday that the Biden administration‚Äôs new
tariffs will not be enough to compete against Beijing. ¬†</p>
<p>‚ÄúChina‚Äôs eating our lunch right now,‚Äù Trump said, adding that Biden
should slap tariffs on ‚Äúmuch more than electric vehicles.‚Äù ¬†¬† ¬†</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey‚Äôve also got to do it on other vehicles, and they have to do it
on a lot of other products,‚Äù Trump told reporters as he entered court
for his hush money trial in New York. ¬†¬†</p>
<p>Asked by reporters on Trump‚Äôs comment about China eating America‚Äôs
lunch (unfairly taking advantage of the U.S.), Biden responded, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs
been feeding them a long time.‚Äù ¬†</p>
<p>The Trump campaign hit back, calling Biden‚Äôs action a ‚Äúweak and
futile attempt to distract from the grievous harm his insane Electric
Vehicle mandate is doing to the U.S. auto industry.‚Äù ¬† ¬†</p>
<p>¬† ¬†</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe fact that these tariffs do not apply to gas-powered cars and
trucks but only to Chinese EVs shows that this has nothing to do with
protecting American Workers,‚Äù Trump campaign press secretary Karoline
Leavitt said in a statement. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all about Crooked Joe‚Äôs agenda of
killing gas-powered automobiles while forcing Americans into
ultra-expensive Electric Vehicles they don‚Äôt want and can‚Äôt afford.‚Äù
¬†</p>
<p>¬† ¬†</p>
<p>Asked by VOA to respond to such criticism, Tai said the tariffs are
‚Äúdesigned to be strategic and not chaotic. They are designed to be
effective and not emotional.‚Äù ¬†¬†</p>
<p>¬† ¬†</p>
<p>Preempting future increases ¬†</p>
<p>Currently, the U.S. imports almost no EVs from China, but the Biden
administration is trying to preempt potential future increases, said
Rachel Ziemba, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American
Security, or CNAS. ¬†</p>
<p>The tariffs hit sectors where the administration has been investing
with industrial policy tools, including the Inflation Reduction Act and
the CHIPS and Science Act, Ziemba told VOA, referring to Biden‚Äôs climate
and energy legislation, and legislation to boost domestic semiconductor
research and manufacturing. ¬†</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn a sense, these tariffs are part of a policy initiative to make
sure that Chinese companies can‚Äôt benefit from that U.S. government
subsidy,‚Äù he said. ¬†</p>
<p>The move is likely to increase friction between the world‚Äôs two
largest economies and is not likely to change Beijing‚Äôs behavior.
¬†¬†¬†</p>
<p>‚ÄúChina opposes unilateral tariffs that violate WTO rules and will
take all measures necessary to defend our legitimate rights and
interests,‚Äù Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang said. ¬†¬† ¬†¬†</p>
<p>Biden reiterated he wants ‚Äúfair competition with China, not
conflict.‚Äù He said the U.S. is in a stronger position to win because of
the investments his administration has made to revive domestic
manufacturing. ¬†</p>
<p>According to a 2022 report by the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, China spent more on industrial policy ($248
billion) than it did on its defense spending ($240 billion) in 2019.
¬†</p>
<p>China spends far more supporting its industries than any other
economy in the CSIS study, and more than twice as much as the U.S. ¬†</p>
<p>Circumventing through Mexico¬†</p>
<p>On the same day Biden announced the new tariffs, Chinese automaker
BYD, the world‚Äôs largest electric vehicle producer, unveiled the Shark,
a midsize hybrid-electric pickup truck, in Mexico. In February, BYD said
it was looking for a location in Mexico for its factory.¬†¬†¬†</p>
<p>A Mexico-made EV with sufficient North America-sourced parts could
qualify for tariff-free entry into the U.S. market under the 2020 United
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA.¬†</p>
<p>The administration said Beijing‚Äôs move to circumvent tariffs via a
U.S. free trade partner is ‚Äúa pattern‚Äù of ‚Äúserious concern‚Äù that it‚Äôs
investigating.¬†</p>
<p>With Chinese EV production moving out of China, taking action against
Chinese EVs in third country markets is something that the
administration should deeply explore, said Wendy Cutler, a former U.S.
trade negotiator who is now vice president of the Asia Society Policy
Institute.¬†</p>
<p>Blocking Beijing‚Äôs circumvention effort can be done by amending the
USMCA or through supplemental agreements, or an investment screening
mechanism separate from the USMCA, she told VOA. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure there are
other alternatives as well that are being explored.‚Äù ¬†</p>
<p>Tai would only reveal that addressing the issue will ‚Äúrequire a
separate pathway,‚Äù without providing details. ‚ÄúI would just ask you to
stay tuned,‚Äù she said.¬†</p>
<p>Anita Powell contributed to this report.</p>

<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>FERC announces new transmission rule
</h3>
<p>
There was quite a lot of news coming out of Washington yesterday. Here‚Äôs
a quick catch-up:
</p>
<p>
<strong>FERC overhauled transmission planning ‚Äì </strong>The Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission
<a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VVN3FK3twK0XW3Yt1n45PfQNLW95j2m75f3FfnN1PJbv23qn9gW7Y8-PT6lZ3l6W2XtvsW6p92g5W4-fkLB3GWnwRW66MKrK67_MZRW7Y8T7529d3gPW6pt2R86d34SSW382-z43F3CJwW3sVq6d2nLZjlW6tYKW34MMXkXW86P6Q-4bv9QqW4bsb1780p_pjW3m09G73TP-_0W2B2W8-1RJt1WM1gLYNkMXDXW2c9y265dpWcXW5r4V6f4brNHhW6-Jmdn4b4P-gW5Q078K19-f4NW5vDcHk2BVRtLW22gRcD2wGkSDW8qwY0g3s8bV3W8b0_4t4cXsXqW7BN9sY4d3nw4N6YYSSFzRXKKW5kXz041Fdg_CW35CYVk95RRnbW87PJY46jGqQvf64nh3F04" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unveiled
and approved</a> a rule overhauling regional transmission planning to
take into account the ongoing and planned transformation of the electric
grid. As Heatmap‚Äôs Matthew Zeitlin
<a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VVN3FK3twK0XW3Yt1n45PfQNLW95j2m75f3FfnN1PJbv23qn9gW7Y8-PT6lZ3kRW2fk0g43mltyfW4skHj41tVy7DW7hLNJB57jY4nVLC0lg8XwSrnW5drlJw5WxrStW3QX_L22-7HchW6Qm_332F0hR2N4nLb3Cz9TQPW4BfNK56w_p5_W53nDcF47z78JW75vBZp4F7RldW1Vv9Zp2c4098W4yz-1N8qtyxlW6WvQbG2zf0N5W7VC1z18VcFkrW9jwp6n3dgrZmW8WJS7M6jcvnbW4YqZrV39qx16VN4hcb7GdVpqW5YSRPZ6X4yWyW31Zl5q7V3DF0W2dj2Zf93svG7VFmqm8859mkFN5NbcKqHsSN7W1Cg5Jx29bqqgW83H4GK1myLZdf78q9bW04" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a>,
the new rule will require regional transmission organizations adopt the
long view, extending their planning horizon over a 20-year period and
calling for updates every five years. FERC is also requiring regional
transmission planners to consult a specific set of economic and
reliability benefits like reducing congestion on the grid and resilience
against extreme weather and lower costs when selecting projects. And
transmission planners will have to come up with a default method for
allocating costs associated with new projects.

<strong>But Chuck Schumer downplayed the possibility of permitting

<em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Today, we examine the controversial

organizations receiving more than 20% of their funding from overseas

<h2 id="ea-is-prototyping-in-game-ads-even-as-we-speak">EA is
prototyping in-game ads even as we speak</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>Electronic Arts has a long, storied history of trying to wring more
money out of gamers after they‚Äôve purchased a game ‚Äî now, it appears,
the company‚Äôs hard at work on its next generation of in-game ads. EA CEO
Andrew Wilson admitted as much on the company‚Äôs Q4 earnings call: when
an analyst asked about ‚Äúthe market opportunity for more dynamic ad
insertion across more traditional AAA games,‚Äù he said the company‚Äôs
already working on it. ‚ÄúWe have teams internally in the company right
now looking at how do we do very thoughtful implementations inside of
our game experiences,‚Äù said Wilson. ‚Ü´ Sean Hollister at The Verge Ads in
games are definitely not new ‚Äì we‚Äôve seen countless games built entirely
around brands, like Tapper for Budweiser, Pepsiman, or Cool Spot for
7-Up ‚Äì and banner ads and product placement in various games has been a
thing for decades, too. It seems like EA wants to take this several
steps further and use things like dynamic ad insertion in games, so that
when you‚Äôre playing some racing game, you‚Äôll get an ad for your local
Hyundai dealer, or an ad for a gun store when you‚Äôre playing GTA in the
US. Either way, it‚Äôs going to make games worse, which is perfectly in
line with EA‚Äôs mission.</p>

<p>When we talk about the Earth‚Äôs Atmosphere, what do we mean? Imagine a
layer cake, wrapping around the Earth. That is essentially what the
Earth‚Äôs atmosphere is like: layers upon layers of gas surrounding the
Earth, working to protect the planet. We asked Rei Ueyama, an
atmospheric scientist at NASA Ames Research Center, to explain [‚Ä¶]</p>

public data file now available, featuring new experimental formats</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
This year‚Äôs public data file is now available, featuring over 156
million metadata records deposited with Crossref through the end of
April 2024 from over 19,000 members. A full breakdown of Crossref
metadata statistics is available
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/06members/53status.html">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Like last year, you can download all of these records in one go via
Academic Torrents or directly from Amazon S3 via the ‚Äúrequester pays‚Äù
method.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Download the file:</strong> The torrent download can be
initiated

In January, Martin Eve
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/increasing-crossref-data-reusability-with-format-experiments/">announced</a>
that we had been experimenting with alternative file formats meant to
make our public data files easier to use by broader audiences. This
year‚Äôs file will be published alongside the tools that can be used on
the public data file to produce two experimental formats:
<a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/labs/packer" target="_blank">JSON-lines</a>
and
<a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/labs/dois2sqlite" target="_blank">SQLite</a>
(and a bonus
<a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/labs/rustsqlitepacker" target="_blank">Rust
version</a>). You can read more about our thinking behind this work in
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/increasing-crossref-data-reusability-with-format-experiments/">Martin‚Äôs
blog post</a>, and we are keen to hear your thoughts on these
alternatives.
</p>
<p>
Our annual public data file is meant to facilitate individuals and
organizations interested in working with the entirety of our metadata
corpus. Starting with the majority of our metadata records in one file
should be much easier than starting from scratch with our API, but
because Crossref metadata is always openly available, you can use
<a href="https://api.crossref.org/" target="_blank">the API</a> to keep
your local copy up to date with new and updated records.
</p>
<p>
If you‚Äôre curious about what you‚Äôll get with the public data file, we‚Äôve
also published a sample version so that you can take a peek before
committing to downloading the ~212 gb file. This file includes a random
sample of JSON files and is available exclusively via torrent
<a href="https://academictorrents.com/details/d47fbe29e5ef93a6695421f79a6efa4b801acff1" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
We hope you find this public data file useful. Should you have any
questions about how to access or use the file, please see the tips
below, or share your questions below (you will be redirected to our
community forum).

Tips for using the torrent and retrieving incremental updates
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Use the public data file if you want all Crossref metadata records.
Everyone is welcome to the metadata, but it will be much faster for you
and much easier on our APIs to get so many records in one file. Here are
some
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/tips-for-using-public-data-files-and-plus-snapshots/">tips
on how to work with the file</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Use the REST API to incrementally add new and updated records once you
have the initial file. Here is
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/tips-for-using-the-crossref-rest-api/">how
to get started</a> (and avoid getting blocked in your enthusiasm to use
all this great metadata!).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
While bibliographic metadata is generally required, because lots of
metadata is optional, records will vary in quality and completeness.
