political polls: From history to interpretation</h2>

<p>During any campaign, it is crucial that voters and candidates have a
way to measure the state of public opinion. Polling — surveying
representative samples of the electorate — allows everyone to understand
and adapt to prevailing sentiments. But it has its flaws.</p>

<h2 id="kris-kristofferson-singer-songwriter-and-actor-dies-at-88">Kris
Kristofferson, singer-songwriter and actor, dies at 88</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — Kris Kristofferson, a Rhodes scholar with a deft
writing style and rough charisma who became a country music superstar
and A-list Hollywood actor, has died.</p>
<p>Kristofferson died at his home in Maui, Hawaii on Saturday, family
spokesperson Ebie McFarland said in an email. He was 88.</p>
<p>McFarland said Kristofferson died peacefully, surrounded by his
family. No cause was given. He was 88.</p>
<p>Starting in the late 1960s, the Brownsville, Texas native wrote such
classics standards as “Sunday Mornin’ Comin’ Down,” “Help Me Make It
Through the Night,” “For the Good Times” and “Me and Bobby McGee.”
Kristofferson was a singer himself, but many of his songs were best
known as performed by others, whether Ray Price crooning “For the Good
Times” or Janis Joplin belting out “Me and Bobby McGee.”</p>
<p>Kristofferson, who could recite William Blake from memory, wove
intricate folk music lyrics about loneliness and tender romance into
popular country music. With his long hair and bell-bottomed slacks and
counterculture songs influenced by Bob Dylan, he represented a new breed
of country songwriters along with such peers as Willie Nelson, John
Prine and Tom T. Hall.</p>
<p>“There’s no better songwriter alive than Kris Kristofferson,” Nelson
said during a November 2009 award ceremony for Kristofferson held by
BMI. “Everything he writes is a standard and we’re all just going to
have to live with that.”</p>
<p>As an actor, he played the leading man opposite Barbara Streisand and
Ellen Burstyn, but also had a fondness for shoot-out Westerns and cowboy
dramas.</p>
<p>He was a Golden Gloves boxer and football player in college, received
a master’s degree in English from Merton College at the University of
Oxford in England and turned down an appointment to teach at the U.S.
Military Academy at West Point, New York, to pursue songwriting in
Nashville. Hoping to break into the industry, he worked as a part-time
janitor at Columbia Records’ Music Row studio in 1966 when Dylan
recorded tracks for the seminal “Blonde on Blonde” double album.</p>
<p>At times, the legend of Kristofferson was larger than real life.
Johnny Cash liked to tell a mostly exaggerated story of how
Kristofferson, a former U.S. Army pilot, landed a helicopter on Cash’s
lawn to give him a tape of “Sunday Mornin’ Comin’ Down” with a beer in
one hand. Over the years in interviews, Kristofferson said with all
respect to Cash, while he did land a helicopter at Cash’s house, the
‘man in black’ wasn’t even home at the time, the demo tape was a song
that no one ever actually cut, and he certainly couldn’t fly a
helicopter holding a beer.</p>
<p>In a 2006 interview with The Associated Press, he said he might not
have had a career without Cash.</p>
<p>“Shaking his hand when I was still in the Army backstage at the Grand
Ole Opry was the moment I’d decided I’d come back,” Kristofferson said.
“It was electric. He kind of took me under his wing before he cut any of
my songs. He cut my first record that was record of the year. He put me
on stage the first time.”</p>
<p>One of his most recorded songs, “Me and Bobby McGee,” was written
based on a recommendation from Monument Records founder Fred Foster.
Foster had a song title in his head called “Me and Bobby McKee,” named
after a female secretary in his building. Kristofferson said in an
interview in the magazine, Performing Songwriter, that he was inspired
to write the lyrics about a man and woman on the road together after
watching the Frederico Fellini film, “La Strada.”</p>
<p>Joplin, who had a close relationship with Kristofferson, changed the
lyrics to make Bobby McGee a man and cut her version just days before
she died in 1970 from a drug overdose. The recording became a posthumous
No. 1 hit for Joplin.</p>
<p>Hits that Kristofferson recorded include “Why Me,” “Loving Her Was
Easier (Than Anything I’ll Ever Do),” “Watch Closely Now,” “Desperados
Waiting for a Train,” “A Song I’d Like to Sing” and “Jesus Was a
Capricorn.”</p>
<p>In 1973, he married fellow songwriter Rita Coolidge and together they
had a successful duet career that earned them two Grammy awards. They
divorced in 1980.</p>

<h2 id="harris-to-campaign-again-in-swing-state-nevada">Harris to
campaign again in swing-state Nevada</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — Vice President Kamala Harris is set to rally in Las
Vegas on Sunday night as both she and Republican Donald Trump continue
to make frequent trips to Nevada, looking to gain momentum in the swing
state as Election Day nears.</p>
<p>The rally is part of Harris’ latest West Coast swing, which included
making her first trip to the U.S.-Mexico border since taking over for
President Joe Biden atop the Democratic presidential ticket. On Friday,
the vice president walked alongside a towering, rust-colored border wall
fitted with barbed wire in Douglas, Arizona, and met with federal
authorities.</p>
<p>She attended a San Francisco fundraiser Saturday and had plans for a
Sunday event in Los Angeles before heading to Nevada, with a return to
Washington set for Monday night.</p>
<p>“This race is as close as it could possibly be,” she said Saturday to
a raucous crowd of donors. “This is a margin-of-error race.”</p>
<p>Harris said even if there is enthusiasm, she’s running like an
underdog. And she invited people to “join our team in battleground
states” to help get voters to the polls — even if it’s Californians
making calls from home.</p>
<p>On Sunday, former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake became the latest prominent
Republican to endorse Harris and Walz. He credited them with a “fine
character and love of country” and said he wants a president who does
not treat political adversaries as enemies or try to subvert the will of
voters.</p>
<p>Flake, a longtime critic of the former president, joins a list of
anti-Trump Republicans who have said they will vote for the Democratic
ticket, not just refrain from voting for Trump. Among them is Dick
Cheney, the deeply conservative former vice president, and his daughter,
Liz.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Maryland Senate candidate Larry Hogan, a former Republican
governor and a sharp critic of Trump, said Harris has yet to earn his
vote, though Trump won’t get it.</p>
<p>In Nevada, all voters automatically receive ballots by mail unless
they opt out — a pandemic-era change that was set in state law. That
means most ballots could start going out in a matter of weeks, well
before Election Day on Nov. 5.</p>
<p>Harris plans to be back in Las Vegas on Oct. 10 for a town hall with
Hispanic voters. Both she and Republican rival Donald Trump have
campaigned frequently in the city, highlighting the critical role that
Nevada, and its mere six votes in the Electoral College, could play in
deciding an election expected to be exceedingly close.</p>
<p>Trump held his own Las Vegas rally on Sept. 13 at the Expo World
Market Center, where Harris is speaking Sunday. Her campaign has
frequently scheduled events in the same venue where her opponent
previously spoke, including in Milwaukee, Atlanta and suburban Phoenix.
During his Las Vegas event, the former president singled out people
crossing into the U.S. illegally, saying Harris “would be the president
of invasion.”</p>
<p>During a campaign stop in the city in June, Trump promised to
eliminate taxes on tips received by waiters, hotel workers and thousands
of other service industry employees. Harris used her own Las Vegas rally
in August to make the same promise.</p>
<p>Fully doing away with federal taxes on tips would probably require an
act from Congress. Still, Nevada’s Culinary Union, which represents
60,000 hospitality workers in Las Vegas and Reno, has endorsed
Harris.</p>
<p>Ted Pappageorge, the culinary union’s secretary-treasurer, said the
difference between the dueling no-taxes-on-tips proposals is that Harris
has also pledged to tackle what his union calls “sub-minimum wage,”
where employers pay service industry workers small salaries and meet
minimum wage thresholds by expecting employees to supplement those with
tips.</p>
<p>Harris has no public schedule for Tuesday, when her running mate,
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, squares off against Republican Ohio Sen. JD
Vance for the first and only vice presidential debate of the campaign.
But Harris and Walz will campaign jointly on Wednesday, making a bus
tour with various stops through central Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The campaign says that during that swing, both will emphasize plans
to energize U.S. manufacturing, including by using tax credits to
encourage steel production and overhaul federal permitting systems to
increase American construction.</p>

id="stuck-nasa-astronauts-welcome-spacex-capsule-to-bring-them-home-next-year">Stuck
NASA astronauts welcome SpaceX capsule to bring them home next year</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Cape Canaveral, Florida — The two astronauts stuck at the
International Space Station since June welcomed their new ride home with
Sunday’s arrival of a SpaceX capsule.</p>
<p>SpaceX launched the rescue mission on Saturday with a downsized crew
of two astronauts and two empty seats reserved for Butch Wilmore and
Suni Williams, who will return next year. The Dragon capsule docked in
darkness high over Botswana as the two craft soared 420 kilometers above
Earth.</p>
<p>NASA switched Wilmore and Williams to SpaceX following concerns over
the safety of their Boeing Starliner capsule. It was the first Starliner
test flight with a crew, and NASA decided the thruster failures and
helium leaks that cropped up after liftoff were too serious and poorly
understood to risk the test pilots’ return. So Starliner returned to
Earth empty earlier this month.</p>
<p>The Dragon carrying NASA’s Nick Hague and the Russian Space Agency’s
Alexander Gorbunov will remain at the space station until February,
turning what should have been a weeklong trip for Wilmore and Williams
into a mission lasting more than eight months.</p>
<p>Two NASA astronauts were pulled from the mission to make room for
Wilmore and Williams on the return leg.</p>
<p>NASA likes to replace its station crews every six months or so.
SpaceX has provided the taxi service since the company’s first astronaut
flight in 2020. NASA also hired Boeing for ferry flights after the space
shuttles were retired, but flawed software and other Starliner issues
led to years of delays and more than $1 billion in repairs.</p>
<p>Starliner inspections are underway at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center,
with post-flight reviews of data set to begin this week.</p>
<p>“We’re a long way from saying, ‘Hey, we’re writing off Boeing,’”
NASA’s associate administrator Jim Free said at a pre-launch
briefing.</p>
<p>The arrival of two fresh astronauts means the four who have been up
there since March can now return to Earth in their own SpaceX capsule in
just over a week. Their stay was extended a month because of the
Starliner turmoil.</p>
<p>Although Saturday’s liftoff went well, SpaceX said the rocket’s spent
upper stage ended up outside its targeted impact zone in the Pacific
because of a bad engine firing. The company has halted all Falcon
launches until it figures out what went wrong.</p>

id="california-governor-vetoes-bill-to-create-first-in-nation-ai-safety-measures">California
governor vetoes bill to create first-in-nation AI safety measures</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Sacramento, California — California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed a
landmark bill aimed at establishing first-in-the-nation safety measures
for large artificial intelligence models Sunday.</p>
<p>The decision is a major blow to efforts attempting to rein in the
homegrown industry that is rapidly evolving with little oversight. The
bill would have established some of the first regulations on large-scale
AI models in the nation and paved the way for AI safety regulations
across the country, supporters said.</p>
<p>Earlier in September, the Democratic governor told an audience at
Dreamforce, an annual conference hosted by software giant Salesforce,
that California must lead in regulating AI in the face of federal
inaction but that the proposal “can have a chilling effect on the
industry.”</p>
<p>The proposal, which drew fierce opposition from startups, tech giants
and several Democratic House members, could have hurt the homegrown
industry by establishing rigid requirements, Newsom said.</p>
<p>“While well-intentioned, SB 1047 does not take into account whether
an AI system is deployed in high-risk environments, involves critical
decision-making or the use of sensitive data,” Newsom said in a
statement. “Instead, the bill applies stringent standards to even the
most basic functions — so long as a large system deploys it. I do not
believe this is the best approach to protecting the public from real
threats posed by the technology.”</p>
<p>Newsom on Sunday instead announced that the state will partner with
several industry experts, including AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, to develop
guardrails around powerful AI models. Li opposed the AI safety
proposal.</p>
<p>The measure, aimed at reducing potential risks created by AI, would
have required companies to test their models and publicly disclose their
safety protocols to prevent the models from being manipulated to, for
example, wipe out the state’s electric grid or help build chemical
weapons. Experts say those scenarios could be possible in the future as
the industry continues to rapidly advance. It also would have provided
whistleblower protections to workers.</p>
<p>The legislation is among a host of bills passed by the legislature
this year to regulate AI, fight deepfakes and protect workers. State
lawmakers said California must take action this year, citing hard
lessons they learned from failing to rein in social media companies when
they might have had a chance.</p>
<p>Proponents of the measure, including Elon Musk and Anthropic, said
the proposal could have injected some levels of transparency and
accountability around large-scale AI models, as developers and experts
say they still don’t have a full understanding of how AI models behave
and why.</p>
<p>The bill targeted systems that require more than $100 million to
build. No current AI models have hit that threshold, but some experts
said that could change within the next year.</p>
<p>“This is because of the massive investment scale-up within the
industry,” said Daniel Kokotajlo, a former OpenAI researcher who
resigned in April over what he saw as the company’s disregard for AI
risks. “This is a crazy amount of power to have any private company
control unaccountably, and it’s also incredibly risky.”</p>
<p>The United States is already behind Europe in regulating AI to limit
risks. The California proposal wasn’t as comprehensive as regulations in
Europe, but it would have been a good first step to set guardrails
around the rapidly growing technology that is raising concerns about job
loss, misinformation, invasions of privacy and automation bias,
supporters said.</p>
<p>A number of leading AI companies last year voluntarily agreed to
follow safeguards set by the White House, such as testing and sharing
information about their models. The California bill would have mandated
that AI developers follow requirements similar to those commitments,
said the measure’s supporters.</p>
<p>But critics, including former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, argued
that the bill would “kill California tech” and stifle innovation. It
would have discouraged AI developers from investing in large models or
sharing open-source software, they said.</p>
<p>Newsom’s decision to veto the bill marks another win in California
for big tech companies and AI developers, many of whom spent the past
year lobbying alongside the California Chamber of Commerce to sway the
governor and lawmakers from advancing AI regulations.</p>
<p>Two other sweeping AI proposals, which also faced mounting opposition
from the tech industry and others, died ahead of a legislative deadline
in August. The bills would have required AI developers to label
AI-generated content and ban discrimination from AI tools used to make
employment decisions.</p>
<p>The governor said earlier this summer he wanted to protect
California’s status as a global leader in AI, noting that 32 of the
world’s top 50 AI companies are located in the state.</p>
<p>He has promoted California as an early adopter as the state could
soon deploy generative AI tools to address highway congestion, provide
tax guidance and streamline homelessness programs. The state also
announced last month a voluntary partnership with AI giant Nvidia to
help train students, college faculty, developers and data scientists.
California is also considering new rules against AI discrimination in
hiring practices.</p>
<p>Earlier in September, Newsom signed some of the toughest laws in the
country to crack down on election deepfakes and measures to protect
Hollywood workers from unauthorized AI use.</p>
<p>But even with Newsom’s veto, the California safety proposal is
inspiring lawmakers in other states to take up similar measures, said
Tatiana Rice, deputy director of the Future of Privacy Forum, a
nonprofit that works with lawmakers on technology and privacy
proposals.</p>
<p>“They are going to potentially either copy it or do something similar
next legislative session,” Rice said. “So it’s not going away.”</p>

id="death-toll-rises-from-helene-while-supplies-are-rushed-to-north-carolina-and-florida-digs-out">Death
toll rises from Helene while supplies are rushed to North Carolina and
Florida digs out</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PERRY, Fla. — Authorities struggled to get water and other supplies
to isolated, flood-stricken areas across the U.S. Southeast in the wake
of Hurricane Helene as the death toll from the storm rose.</p>
<p>A North Carolina county that includes the mountain city of Asheville
reported 30 people killed due to the storm, pushing the overall death
toll to at least 84 people across several states.</p>
<p>Supplies were being airlifted to the region around the isolated city.
Buncombe County Manager Avril Pinder pledged that she would have food
and water into Ashville — which is known for its arts, culture and
natural attractions — by Monday.</p>
<p>“We hear you. We need food and we need water,” Pinder said on a
Sunday call with reporters. “My staff has been making every request
possible to the state for support and we’ve been working with every
single organization that has reached out. What I promise you is that we
are very close.”</p>
<p>Officials warned that rebuilding from the widespread loss of homes
and property would be lengthy and difficult. The storm upended life
throughout the Southeast. Deaths also were reported in Florida, Georgia,
South Carolina and Virginia.</p>
<p>North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper predicted the toll would rise as
rescuers and other emergency workers reached areas isolated by collapsed
roads, failing infrastructure and widespread flooding.</p>
<p>He implored residents in western North Carolina to avoid travel, both
for their own safety and to keep roads clear for emergency vehicles.
More than 50 search teams spread throughout the region in search of
stranded people.</p>
<p>One rescue effort involved saving 41 people north of Asheville.
Another mission focused on saving a single infant. The teams found
people through both 911 calls and social media messages, North Carolina
National Guard Adjutant General Todd Hunt said.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden described the impact of the storm as “stunning”
and said he would visit the area this week as long as it does not
disrupt rescues or recovery work.</p>
<p>Hurricane Helene roared ashore late Thursday in Florida’s Big Bend
region as a Category 4 hurricane with 225 kph winds. A weakened Helene
quickly moved through Georgia, then soaked the Carolinas and Tennessee
with torrential rains that flooded creeks and rivers and strained
dams.</p>
<p>There have been hundreds of water rescues, including in rural Unicoi
County in East Tennessee, where dozens of patients and staff were
plucked by helicopter from a hospital rooftop Friday.</p>
<p>More than 2 million homeowners and other utility customers were still
without power Sunday night. South Carolina had the most outages and
Gov. Henry McMaster asked for patience as crews dealt with widespread
snapped power poles.</p>
<p>“We want people to remain calm. Help is on the way, it is just going
to take time,” McMaster told reporters outside the airport in Aiken
County.</p>
<p>The storm unleashed the worst flooding in a century in North
Carolina. One community, Spruce Pine, was doused with over 61
centimeters of rain from Tuesday through Saturday.</p>
<p>Jessica Drye Turner in Texas had begged for someone to rescue her
family members stranded on their rooftop in Asheville amid rising
floodwaters. “They are watching 18-wheelers and cars floating by,”
Turner wrote in an urgent Facebook post on Friday.</p>
<p>But in a follow-up message Saturday, Turner said help had not arrived
in time to save her parents, both in their 70s, and her 6-year-old
nephew. The roof collapsed and the three drowned.</p>
<p>“I cannot convey in words the sorrow, heartbreak and devastation my
sisters and I are going through,” she wrote.</p>
<p>The state was sending water supplies and other items toward Buncombe
County and Asheville, but mudslides blocking Interstate 40 and other
highways prevented supplies from making it. The county’s own water
supplies were on the other side of the Swannanoa River, away from where
most of the 270,000 people in Buncombe County live, officials said.</p>
<p>Law enforcement was making plans to send officers to places that
still had water, food or gas because of reports of arguments and threats
of violence, the county sheriff said.</p>
<p>FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell toured south Georgia on Sunday and
planned to be in North Carolina Monday.</p>
<p>“It’s still very much an active search and rescue mission” in western
North Carolina, Criswell said. “And we know that there’s many
communities that are cut off just because of the geography” of the
mountains, where damage to roads and bridges have cut off certain
areas.</p>
<p>Biden on Saturday pledged federal government help for Helene’s
“overwhelming” devastation. He also approved a disaster declaration for
North Carolina, making federal funding available for affected
individuals.</p>
<p>In Florida’s Big Bend, some lost nearly everything they own. With
sanctuaries still darkened as of Sunday morning, some churches canceled
regular services while others like Faith Baptist Church in Perry opted
to worship outside.</p>
<p>Standing water and tree debris still covers the grounds of Faith
Baptist Church. The church called on parishioners to come “pray for our
community” in a message posted to the congregation’s Facebook page.</p>
<p>“We have power. We don’t have electricity,” Immaculate Conception
Catholic Church parishioner Marie Ruttinger said. “Our God has power.
That’s for sure.”</p>
<p>Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said Saturday that it looked “like a bomb
went off” after viewing splintered homes and debris-covered highways
from the air.</p>
<p>In eastern Georgia near the border with South Carolina, officials
notified Augusta residents Sunday morning that water service would be
shut off for 24 to 48 hours in the city and surrounding Richmond
County.</p>
<p>A news release said trash and debris from the storm “blocked our
ability to pump water.” Officials were distributing bottled water.</p>
<p>With at least 25 killed in South Carolina, Helene was the deadliest
tropical cyclone for the state since Hurricane Hugo made landfall north
of Charleston in 1989, killing 35 people.</p>
<p>Moody’s Analytics said it expects $15 billion to $26 billion in
property damage.</p>
<p>Climate change has exacerbated conditions that allow such storms to
thrive, rapidly intensifying in warming waters and turning into powerful
cyclones sometimes within hours.</p>
<p>A new tropical depression in the eastern Atlantic Ocean could become
a “formidable hurricane” later this week, the National Hurricane Center
said Sunday. The depression had sustained 55 kph winds and was located
about 945 kilometers west-southwest of the Cape Verde Islands, the
center said. It could become a hurricane by Wednesday.</p>

boosts air support and hikes troops’ readiness to deploy for Middle
East</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The U.S. military said on Sunday it was increasing its
air support capabilities in the Middle East and putting troops on a
heightened readiness to deploy to the region as it warned Iran against
expanding the ongoing conflict. </p>
<p>The announcement came two days after President Joe Biden directed the
Pentagon to adjust U.S. force posture in the Middle East amid
intensifying concern that Israel’s killing of the leader of Iran-backed
Hezbollah could prompt Tehran to retaliate. </p>
<p>“The United States is determined to prevent Iran and Iranian-backed
partners and proxies from exploiting the situation or expanding the
conflict,” Pentagon spokesperson Major General Patrick Ryder said in a
statement. </p>
<p>He also cautioned that if Iran or groups Tehran backs “use this
moment to target American personnel or interests in the region, the
United States will take every necessary measure to defend our
people.” </p>
<p>The Pentagon statement offered few clues as to the size or scope of
the new air deployment, saying only that “we will further reinforce our
defensive air-support capabilities in the coming days.” </p>
<p>Israel struck more targets in Lebanon on Sunday, pressing Hezbollah
with new attacks after killing the group’s leader, Sayyed Hassan
Nasrallah, and a string of its other top commanders in an escalating
military campaign. </p>
<p>The strikes have dealt a stunning succession of blows to Hezbollah
after almost a year of cross-border fire, killing much of its leadership
and revealing gaping security holes. But it has also raised questions
about Washington’s publicly declared goals of containing the conflict
and safeguarding U.S. personnel throughout the Middle East. </p>
<p>White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said on Sunday
that the United States is watching to see what Hezbollah does to try to
fill its leadership vacuum, “and is continuing to talk to the Israelis
about what the right next steps are.” </p>
<p>The U.S. State Department has yet to order an evacuation from
Lebanon. But last week, U.S. officials told Reuters the Pentagon was
sending a few dozen additional troops to Cyprus to help the military
prepare for scenarios including an evacuation of Americans from
Lebanon. </p>
<p>The Pentagon said U.S. forces were being made ready to deploy, if
needed.  </p>
<p>“[Austin] increased the readiness of additional U.S. forces to
deploy, elevating our preparedness to respond to various contingencies,”
Ryder said in a statement.</p>

airstrikes on Syria kill 37 militants affiliated with extremist
groups</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BEIRUT — In Syria, 37 militants affiliated to the extremist Islamic
State group and an al-Qaida-linked group were killed in two strikes, the
United States military said Sunday. </p>
<p>Two of the dead were senior militants, it said. </p>
<p>U.S. Central Command said it struck northwestern Syria on Tuesday,
targeting a senior militant from the al-Qaida-linked Hurras al-Deen
group and eight others. They say he was responsible for overseeing
military operations. </p>
<p>They also announced a strike from earlier this month on Sept. 16,
where they conducted a “large-scale airstrike” on an IS training camp in
a remote undisclosed location in central Syria. That attack killed 28
militants, including “at least four Syrian leaders.” </p>
<p>“The airstrike will disrupt ISIS’ capability to conduct operations
against U.S. interests, as well as our allies and partners,” the
statement read. </p>
<p>There are some 900 U.S. forces in Syria, along with an undisclosed
number of contractors, mostly trying to prevent any comeback by the
extremist IS group, which swept through Iraq and Syria in 2014, taking
control of large swaths of territory. </p>
<p>U.S. forces advise and assist their key allies in northeastern Syria,
the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, located not far from strategic
areas where Iran-backed militant groups are present, including a key
border crossing with Iraq.</p>

suicides in 2023 still at highest level in nation’s history, says
data</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — U.S. suicides last year remained at about the highest
level in the nation’s history, preliminary data suggests. </p>
<p>A little more than 49,300 suicide deaths were reported in 2023,
according to provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. That number that could grow a little as some death
investigations are wrapped up and reported. </p>
<p>Just under 49,500 were reported in 2022, according to final data
released Thursday. The numbers are close enough that the suicide rate
for the two years are the same, CDC officials said. </p>
<p>U.S. suicide rates have been rising for nearly 20 years, aside from a
two-year drop around the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. So “a
leveling off of any increase in suicide is cautiously promising news,”
said Katherine Keyes, a Columbia University public health professor who
studies suicide. </p>
<p>Indeed, there’s reason for optimism. A 2-year-old national crisis
line allows anyone in the U.S. to dial 988 to reach mental health
specialists. That and other efforts may be starting to pay off, Keyes
said, but it “really remains to be seen.” </p>
<p>Experts caution that suicide — the nation’s 11th-leading cause of
death in 2022 — is complicated and that attempts can be driven by a
range of factors. Contributors include higher rates of depression,
limited availability of mental health services, and the availability of
guns. About 55% of all suicide deaths in 2022 involved firearms,
according to CDC data. </p>
<p>The CDC’s Thursday report said: </p>
<p>—Suicide was the second-leading cause of death for people ages 10–14
and 20–34, and the third-leading cause for people ages 15–19. </p>
<p>—Deaths continue to be more common among boys and men than girls and
women. The highest suicide rate for any group — by far — was in men ages
75 and older, at about 44 suicides per 100,000 men that age. </p>
<p>—Among women, the highest rate was in those who were middle-aged,
about 9 per 100,000. But more dramatic increases have been seen in teens
and young women, with the rate for that group doubling in the last two
decades. </p>
<p>—The overall suicide rate in 2022 and 2023 was 14.2 per 100,000. It
also was that high in 2018. Before then, it hadn’t been that high since

<h2 id="in-us-its-time-to-roll-up-sleeves-for-new-covid-flu-shots">In
US, it’s time to roll up sleeves for new COVID, flu shots</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Fall means it’s time for just about everybody to get up
to date on their flu and COVID-19 vaccines – and a lot of older adults
also need protection against another risky winter virus, RSV.</p>
<p>Yes, you can get your flu and COVID-19 shots at the same time. Don’t
call them boosters — they’re not just another dose of last year’s
protection. The coronavirus and influenza are escape artists that
constantly mutate to evade your body’s immune defenses, so both vaccines
are reformulated annually to target newer strains.</p>
<p>“Right now is the best time” to get all the recommended fall
vaccinations, said Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, as she got her flu shot Wednesday. She has an
appointment for her COVID-19 shot, too. It’s “the single most effective
thing you can do to protect yourself, your family, your community.”</p>
<p>While they’re not perfect, vaccinations offer strong protection
against a bad case of flu or COVID-19 — or dying from it.</p>
<p>“It may not prevent every infection but those infections are going to
be less severe,” said CDC’s Dr. Demetre Daskalakis. “I would rather have
my grandmother or my great-grandmother have a sniffle than have to go to
the emergency room on Thanksgiving.”</p>
<p>The challenge: Getting more Americans to roll up their sleeves. Last
year, just 45% of adults got a flu vaccination and even fewer, 23%, got
a COVID-19 shot. A survey released Wednesday by the National Foundation
for Infectious Diseases shows an equally low number intend to this
fall.</p>
<p>And the coronavirus still killed more Americans than flu last
year.</p>
<p>“Maybe we believe that it’s not going to be me but let’s not take a
chance,” said Dr. Michael Knight of George Washington University. “Why
not get a vaccine that’s going to help you reduce that risk?”</p>
<p>Who needs a fall COVID-19 or flu vaccination?</p>
<p>The CDC urges both an updated COVID-19 shot and yearly flu vaccine
for everyone ages 6 months and older. If you recently had COVID-19, you
can wait two or three months but still should get an updated vaccination
because of the expected winter surge.</p>
<p>Both viruses can be especially dangerous to certain groups including
older people and those with weak immune systems and lung or heart
disease. Young children also are more vulnerable. The CDC counted 199
child deaths from flu last year.</p>
<p>Pregnancy also increases the chances of serious COVID-19 or flu – and
vaccination guards mom plus ensures the newborn has some protection,
too.</p>
<p>What’s new about the COVID-19 shots?</p>
<p>Last fall’s shots targeted a coronavirus strain that’s no longer
spreading while this year’s are tailored to a new section of the
coronavirus family tree. The Pfizer and Moderna shots are formulated
against a virus subtype called KP.2 while the Novavax vaccine targets
its parent strain, JN.1. Daskalakis said all should offer good cross
protection to other subtypes now spreading.</p>
<p>The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines can be used by adults and
children as young as 6 months. The Novavax shot is a more traditional
protein vaccine combined with an immune booster, and open to anyone 12
and older.</p>
<p>Which flu vaccine to choose?</p>
<p>High-dose shots and one with a special immune booster are designed
for people 65 and older, but if they can’t find one easily they can
choose a regular all-ages flu shot.</p>
<p>For the shot-averse, the nasal spray FluMist is available for ages 2
to 49 at pharmacies and clinics — although next year it’s set to be
available for use at home.</p>
<p>All flu vaccinations this year will guard against two Type A flu
strains and one Type B strain. Another once-common form of Type B flu
quit spreading a few years ago and was removed from the vaccine.</p>
<p>What about that other virus, RSV?</p>
<p>RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a coldlike nuisance for most
people but it, too, packs hospitals every winter and can be deadly for
children under 5, the elderly and people with certain high-risk health
problems.</p>
<p>The CDC recommends an RSV vaccination for everyone 75 and older, and
for people 60 to 74 who are at increased risk. This is a one-time shot,
not a yearly vaccination – but only 24% of seniors got it last year.
It’s also recommended late in pregnancy to protect babies born during
the fall and winter.</p>
<p>And while “your arm may hurt and you may feel crummy for a day,” it’s
also fine to get the RSV, flu and COVID-19 vaccines at the same time,
Daskalakis said.</p>
<p>What will it cost?</p>
<p>The vaccines are supposed to be free under Medicare, Medicaid and
most private insurance plans if people use an in-network provider.</p>
<p>About 1.5 million uninsured adults got free COVID-19 vaccinations
through a federal program last year but that has ended. Instead, the CDC
is providing $62 million to health departments to help improve access –
and states and large cities are starting to roll out their plans.</p>
<p>Call your local health department to ask about options because in
many areas, “availability of vaccine at lower or no cost is expected to
trickle in over the next couple of weeks,” advised Dr. Raynard
Washington, who heads the Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, health
department.</p>
<p>Check the government website, vaccines.gov, for availability at local
pharmacies.</p>

id="trump-lists-his-grievances-in-a-wisconsin-speech-intended-to-link-harris-to-illegal-immigration">Trump
lists his grievances in a Wisconsin speech intended to link Harris to
illegal immigration</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PRAIRIE DU CHIEN, Wisconsin — Former President Donald Trump meandered
Saturday through a list of grievances against Vice President Kamala
Harris and other issues during an event intended to link his Democratic
opponent to illegal border crossings.</p>
<p>A day after Harris discussed immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border,
Trump spoke to a crowd in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, about
immigration. He blamed Harris for migrants committing crimes after
entering the U.S. illegally, alleging she was responsible for “erasing
our border.”</p>
<p>“I will liberate Wisconsin from the mass migrant invasion,” he said.
“We’re going to liberate the country.”</p>
<p>Trump hopes frustration over illegal immigration will translate to
votes in Wisconsin and other crucial swing states. The Republican
nominee has denounced people who cross the U.S.-Mexico border as
“poisoning the blood of the country” and vowed to stage the largest
deportation operation in American history if elected. And polls show
Americans believe Trump would do a better job than Harris on handling
immigration.</p>
<p>Trump shifted from topic to topic so quickly that it was hard to keep
track of what he meant at times. He talked about the two assassination
attempts against him and blamed the U.S. Secret Service for not being
able to hold a large outdoor rally instead of an event in a smaller
indoor space. But he also offered asides about climate change, Harris’
father, how his beach body was better than President Joe Biden’s, and a
fly that was buzzing near him.</p>
<p>“I wonder where the fly came from,” he said. “Two years ago, I
wouldn’t have had a fly up here. You’re changing rapidly. But we can’t
take it any longer. We can’t take it any longer.”</p>
<p>Trump repeatedly brought up Harris’ Friday event in Douglas, Arizona,
where she announced a push to further restrict asylum claims beyond
Biden’s executive order announced earlier this year. Harris denounced
Trump’s handling of the border while president and his opposing a
bipartisan border package earlier this year, saying Trump “prefers to
run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.”</p>
<p>“I had to sit there and listen” to Harris last night Trump said,
eliciting cheers. “And who puts it on? Fox News. They should not be
allowed to put it on. It’s all lies. Everything she says is lies.”</p>
<p>The Republican nominee also intensified his personal attacks against
Harris, insulting her as “mentally impaired” and a “disaster.”</p>
<p>Trump professed not to understand what Harris meant when she said he
was responsible for taking children from their parents. Under his
administration, border agents separated children from their parents at
the U.S.-Mexico border in a policy that was condemned globally as
inhumane and one that Trump himself ended under pressure from his own
party.</p>
<p>Harris, at a rally in San Francisco, told supporters there were “two
very different visions for our nation” and voters see it “every day on
the campaign trail.”</p>
<p>“Donald Trump is the same old tired show,” she said. “The same tired
playbook we have heard for years.”</p>
<p>She said Trump was “a very unserious man.” “However, the consequences
of putting him back in the White House are extremely serious.”</p>
<p>At Trump’s event, on either side of the stage were poster-sized mug
shots of men in the U.S. illegally accused of a crime, including
Alejandro Jose Coronel Zarate, a case Trump cited in his speech.</p>
<p>Wisconsin Republicans in recent days have cited the story of Coronel
Zarate’s arrest in Prairie du Chien as more evidence that people in the
country illegally are committing crimes across the United States, not
just in southern border states. Prosecutors charged Coronel Zarate on
September 18 with sexual assault, child abuse, strangulation and
domestic abuse. His lawyers declined to comment.</p>

id="spacex-launches-rescue-mission-for-2-nasa-astronauts-stranded-in-space">SpaceX
launches rescue mission for 2 NASA astronauts stranded in space</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida — SpaceX launched a rescue mission for the
two stuck astronauts at the International Space Station on Saturday,
sending up a downsized crew to bring them home but not until next
year. </p>
<p>The capsule rocketed into orbit to fetch the test pilots whose Boeing
spacecraft returned to Earth empty earlier this month because of safety
concerns. The switch in rides left it to NASA’s Nick Hague and Russia’s
Alexander Gorbunov to retrieve Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams. </p>
<p>Because NASA rotates space station crews approximately every six
months, this newly launched flight with two empty seats reserved for
Wilmore and Williams won’t return until late February. Officials said
there wasn’t a way to bring them back earlier on SpaceX without
interrupting other scheduled missions. </p>
<p>By the time they return, the pair will have logged more than eight
months in space. They expected to be gone just a week when they signed
up for Boeing’s first astronaut flight that launched in June. </p>
<p>NASA ultimately decided that Boeing’s Starliner was too risky after a
cascade of thruster troubles and helium leaks marred its trip to the
orbiting complex. The space agency cut two astronauts from this SpaceX
launch to make room on the Dragon capsule’s return leg for Wilmore and
Williams. </p>
<p>Wilmore and Williams watched the liftoff via a live link sent to the
space station, prompting a cheer of “Go Dragon!” from Williams, NASA
deputy program manager Dina Contella said. </p>
<p>Williams has been promoted to commander of the space station, which
will soon be back to its normal population of seven. Once Hague and
Gorbunov arrive Sunday, four astronauts living there since March can
leave in their own SpaceX capsule. Their homecoming was delayed a month
by Starliner’s turmoil. </p>
<p>Hague noted before the flight that change is the one constant in
human spaceflight. </p>
<p>“There’s always something that is changing. Maybe this time it’s been
a little more visible to the public,” he said. </p>
<p>Hague was thrust into the commander’s job for the rescue mission
based on his experience and handling of a launch emergency six years
ago. The Russian rocket failed shortly after liftoff, and the capsule
carrying him and a cosmonaut catapulted off the top to safety. </p>
<p>Rookie NASA astronaut Zena Cardman and veteran space flier Stephanie
Wilson were pulled from this flight after NASA opted to go with SpaceX
to bring the stuck astronauts home. Promised a future space mission,
both were at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, taking part in the launch
livestream. Gorbunov remained on the flight under an exchange agreement
between NASA and the Russian Space Agency. </p>
<p>“Every crewed launch that I have ever watched has really brought me a
lot of emotion. This one today was especially unique,” a teary-eyed
Cardman said following the early afternoon liftoff. “It was hard not to
watch that rocket lift off without thinking, ‘That’s my rocket and
that’s my crew.’” </p>
<p>Moments before liftoff, Hague paid tribute to his two colleagues left
behind: “Unbreakable. We did it together.” Once in orbit, he called it a
“sweet ride” and thanked everyone who made it possible. </p>
<p>Earlier, Hague acknowledged the challenges of launching with half a
crew and returning with two astronauts trained on another
spacecraft. </p>
<p>“We’ve got a dynamic challenge ahead of us,” Hague said after
arriving from Houston last weekend. “We know each other and we’re
professionals and we step up and do what’s asked of us.” </p>
<p>SpaceX has long been the leader in NASA’s commercial crew program,
established as the space shuttles were retiring more than a decade ago.
SpaceX beat Boeing in delivering astronauts to the space station in
2020, and it is now up to 10 crew flights for NASA. </p>
<p>Boeing has struggled with a variety of issues over the years,
repeating a Starliner test flight with no one on board after the first
one veered off course. The Starliner that left Wilmore and Williams in
space landed without any issues in the New Mexico desert on September 6,
and has since returned to Kennedy Space Center. A week ago, Boeing’s
defense and space chief was replaced. </p>
<p>Delayed by Hurricane Helene pounding Florida, the latest SpaceX
liftoff marked the first for astronauts from Launch Complex 40 at Cape
Canaveral Space Force Station. SpaceX took over the old Titan rocket pad
nearly two decades ago and used it for satellite and station cargo
launches, while flying crews from Kennedy’s former Apollo and shuttle
pad next door. The company wanted more flexibility as more Falcon
rockets soared.</p>

id="biden-harris-call-israeli-killing-of-hezbollahs-nasrallah-measure-of-justice">Biden,
Harris call Israeli killing of Hezbollah’s Nasrallah ‘measure of
justice’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>REHOBOTH BEACH, Delaware — The Israeli strike that killed Hezbollah’s
Hassan Nasrallah was a “measure of justice” for victims of a four-decade
“reign of terror,” President Joe Biden said Saturday. </p>
<p>The comments came after Lebanon’s Hezbollah group confirmed earlier
Saturday that Nasrallah, one of the group’s founders, was killed in an
Israeli airstrike in Beirut the previous day. </p>
<p>Biden noted that the operation to take out Nasrallah took place in
the broader context of the conflict that began with Hamas’ massacre of
Israelis on October 7, 2023. </p>
<p>“Nasrallah, the next day, made the fateful decision to join hands
with Hamas and open what he called a ‘northern front’ against Israel,”
Biden said in a statement. </p>
<p>He also noted that Hezbollah under Nasrallah’s watch has been
responsible for the deaths of thousands of Americans, Israelis and
Lebanese. </p>
<p>Hezbollah attacks against U.S. interests include the truck bombing of
the U.S. Embassy and multinational force barracks in Beirut in 1983 and
the kidnapping of the Central Intelligence Agency chief of station in
Beirut, who died while held captive. The U.S. said Hezbollah leaders
armed and trained militias that carried out attacks on U.S. forces
during the war in Iraq. </p>
<p>The White House sees the death of Nasrallah as a huge blow to
Hezbollah. At the same time, the administration has sought to tread
carefully as it has tried to contain Israel’s war with Hamas, which,
like Hezbollah, is backed by Iran, from exploding into an all-out
regional conflict. </p>
<p>The White House and Pentagon were quick Friday, shortly after the
strike, to say publicly that Israel offered it no forewarning of the
operation. </p>
<p>“President Biden and I do not want to see conflict in the Middle East
escalate into a broader regional war,” Vice President Kamala Harris said
in a statement Saturday that echoed Biden’s description of a “measure of
justice.” She added, “diplomacy remains the best path forward to protect
civilians and achieve lasting stability in the region.” </p>
<p>The confirmation of Nasrallah’s death comes during a week that began
with Biden’s top national security aides working on the sidelines of the
United Nations General Assembly to build support for a 21-day
Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire that they hoped might also breathe new life
into stalled efforts to secure a truce in Gaza. </p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a defiant speech
Friday to the United Nations, vowing to keep up operations against
Hezbollah until tens of thousands of Israeli citizens displaced by
rocket attacks can return home. Shortly after, Israel carried out the
strike that killed Nasrallah. </p>
<p>Biden reiterated Saturday that he wants to see cease-fires both in
Gaza and between Israel and Hezbollah. </p>
<p>“It is time for these deals to close, for the threats to Israel to be
removed, and for the broader Middle East region to gain greater
stability,” Biden said. </p>
<p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian accused the United States of
supporting the killing that took out Nasrallah and dozens of
others. </p>
<p>“The world community will not forget that the order of the terrorist
strike was issued from New York and the Americans cannot absolve
themselves from complicity with the Zionists,” Pezeshkian was quoted as
saying in a statement read on Iranian state television.</p>

id="at-un-russian-foreign-minister-dismisses-zelenskyys-peace-plan-as-doomed">At
UN, Russian foreign minister dismisses Zelenskyy’s peace plan as
‘doomed’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>united nations — Russia’s foreign minister reinforced the Kremlin’s
disagreements with the West in his United Nations General Assembly
remarks Saturday and showed no interest in a genuine peace with
Ukraine. </p>
<p>“I’m not going to talk here about the senselessness and the danger of
the very idea of trying to fight to victory with a nuclear power, which
is what Russia is,” Sergey Lavrov said. </p>
<p>Earlier this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin revised his
government’s nuclear doctrine, in a clear attempt to discourage the West
from lifting its restrictions on Ukraine using long-range weapons to
strike inside Russian territory. </p>
<p>Lavrov dismissed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s 10-point
peace formula as “doomed,” and said a resolution of the conflict is not
possible unless the root causes of the crisis, as Moscow sees them, are
addressed. </p>
<p>The veteran diplomat also took the opportunity to repeat complaints
about NATO, Washington, London and the European Union. </p>
<p>His speech came a few hours after Lebanese Hezbollah acknowledged the
death of their leader, Hassan Nasrallah, following a series of targeted
Israeli airstrikes in Beirut. </p>
<p>“We are particularly concerned by the now almost commonplace practice
of political killings, as once again, took place yesterday in Beirut,”
he told the assembly. </p>
<p>At a news conference following his speech, Lavrov expressed concerns
about a wider regional war. </p>
<p>“A lot of people say that Israel wants to create the grounds to drag
the U.S. directly into this,” he said. “And so, to create these grounds,
is trying to provoke Iran and Hezbollah. So the Iran leadership, I
think, are behaving extremely responsibly, and this is something that we
should take due note of.” </p>
<p>War in Ukraine </p>
<p>In February 2022, Russia and China declared a “no limits
partnership,” just days before President Putin launched his full-scale
invasion of Ukraine. </p>
<p>The United States has repeatedly accused China of assisting the
Kremlin with its war. </p>
<p>“China, another permanent member of this council, is the top provider
of machine tools, microelectronics, and other items that Russia is using
to rebuild, to restock, to ramp up its war machine and sustain its
brutal aggression,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday
at a high-level U.N. Security Council meeting on Ukraine that President
Zelenskyy attended. </p>
<p>Beijing denies the charge and has sought to distance itself publicly
from Moscow on the war. </p>
<p>“The top priority is to commit to no expansion of the battlefield, no
escalation of fighting, and no provocation by any party, and push for
de-escalation of the situation as soon as possible,” Foreign Minister
Wang Yi told the General Assembly on Saturday. </p>
<p>Beijing says it is committed to playing “a constructive role” in
ending the conflict. </p>
<p>China and ‘multipolar world’ </p>
<p>On the margins of the annual U.N. meetings, China and Brazil launched
what they are calling the group of friends for peace for Ukraine, which
includes several other countries from the global south. </p>
<p>In a sign of China’s desire to be recognized as a global economic and
political power, Wang said international relations should be “more
democratic.” </p>
<p>“Gone are the days when one or two major powers call the shots on
everything,” he said. “We should advocate an equal and orderly
multipolar world and see that all countries, regardless of their size,
have their own place and role in the multipolar system.” </p>
<p>Wang also called for full U.N. membership for the Palestinians and
urged implementation of a two-state solution. </p>
<p>“There must not be any delay in reaching a comprehensive cease-fire,
and the fundamental way out lies in the two-state solution,” he
said. </p>
<p>Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi asked the assembly how the
international community could believe Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu’s claim on Friday that “Israel yearns for peace.”   </p>
<p>“Yesterday, while he was here, Israel conducted an unprecedented,
massive air attack on Beirut. Prime Minister Netanyahu wants the war to
continue. We must stop that! I repeat, we must stop that! We must
pressure Israel to come back to a political solution for a two-state
solution,” she said to much applause. </p>
<p>Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister also expressed concern about regional
stability following the escalation in Lebanon. </p>
<p>“We call on all parties to show wisdom and to show restraint in order
to avoid a true war breaking out in the region,” Prince Faisal bin
Farhan Al-Saud said.</p>

Asia-Pacific nations hold joint exercises in South China Sea</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MANILA, PHILIPPINES — The armed forces of five countries conducted
joint maritime exercises in a portion of the South China Sea on Saturday
as China carried out its own military drills in the disputed
waterway. </p>
<p>The exercises involving the Philippines, United States, Australia,
Japan and — for the first time — New Zealand took place in Manila’s
exclusive economic zone and sought to improve the militaries’
interoperability, the Philippine armed forces said in a statement.</p>
<p>Saturday’s exercises included a Philippine warship, the United
States’ USS Howard, Japan’s JS Sazanami and New Zealand’s HMNZS
Aotearoa, the statement said.</p>
<p>Australia’s Department of Defense said the drills demonstrated “our
collective commitment to strengthen regional and international
cooperation in support of a peaceful, stable and prosperous
Indo-Pacific.”</p>
<p>The exercises follow a series of air and sea encounters between the
Philippines and China, which have sparred over disputed areas of the
South China Sea, including the Scarborough Shoal, one of Asia’s most
contested features. The shoal has been occupied by China’s coast guard
for more than a decade.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, naval vessels from New Zealand and Australia sailed
through the Taiwan Strait, part of the South China Sea.</p>
<p>China, which claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own, says
it alone exercises sovereignty and jurisdiction over the strait. The
U.S. and Taiwan say the strait — a major trade route through which about
half of global container ships pass — is an international waterway.</p>
<p>Australia has “consistently pressed China on peace and stability in
the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait,” Australian Foreign Minister
Penny Wong said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly on
Saturday.</p>
<p>“We have welcomed the resumption of leader- and military-level
dialogue between the U.S. and China,” Wong said, according to a
transcript.</p>
<p>Chinese air and naval forces conducted maneuvers in a disputed area
of the sea hours after the country’s top diplomat discussed ways of
reducing regional tension with his U.S. counterpart.</p>
<p>China claims nearly all of the South China Sea, despite overlapping
maritime claims by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam,
angering its neighbors.</p>

<h2 id="dead-millions-without-power-after-helene-sweeps-us-southeast">64
dead, millions without power after Helene sweeps US Southeast</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PERRY, Florida — Massive rains from powerful Hurricane Helene left
people stranded, without shelter and awaiting rescue, as the cleanup
began from a tempest that killed at least 64 people, caused widespread
destruction across the U.S. Southeast and knocked out power to millions
of people.</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen so many people homeless as what I have right now,”
said Janalea England of Steinhatchee, Florida, a small river town along
the state’s rural Big Bend, as she turned her commercial fish market
into a storm donation site for friends and neighbors, many of whom
couldn’t get insurance on their homes.</p>
<p>Helene blew ashore in Florida’s Big Bend region as a Category 4
hurricane late Thursday with winds of 225 kph.</p>
<p>From there, it quickly moved through Georgia, where Gov. Brian Kemp
said Saturday that it “looks like a bomb went off” after viewing
splintered homes and debris-covered highways from the air. Weakened,
Helene then soaked the Carolinas and Tennessee with torrential rains,
sending creeks and rivers over their banks and straining dams.</p>
<p>Western North Carolina was isolated because of landslides and
flooding that forced the closure of Interstate 40 and other roads. All
those closures delayed the start of the East Tennessee State University
football game against The Citadel because the Buccaneers’ drive to
Charleston, South Carolina, took 16 hours.</p>
<p>There have been hundreds of water rescues, none more dramatic than in
rural Unicoi County in East Tennessee, where dozens of patients and
staff were plucked by helicopter from a hospital rooftop Friday. And the
rescues continued into the following day in Buncombe County, North
Carolina, where part of Asheville was under water.</p>
<p>“To say this caught us off guard would be an understatement,” said
Quentin Miller, the county sheriff. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Asheville resident Mario Moraga said it was “heartbreaking” to see
the damage in the Biltmore Village neighborhood and neighbors have been
going house to house to check on each other and offer support.</p>
<p>“There’s no cell service here. There’s no electricity,” he said.</p>
<p>While there have been deaths in the county, Emergency Services
Director Van Taylor Jones said he wasn’t ready to report specifics,
partially because downed cell towers hindered efforts to contact next of
kin. Relatives put out desperate pleas for help on Facebook.</p>
<p>The storm, now a post-tropical cyclone, was expected to hover over
the Tennessee Valley on Saturday and Sunday, the National Hurricane
Center said.</p>
<p>It unleashed the worst flooding in a century in North Carolina. One
community, Spruce Pine, was doused with over 0.6 meters of rain from
Tuesday through Saturday.</p>
<p>And in Atlanta, 28.24 centimeters of rain fell over 48 hours, the
most the city has seen over two days since record keeping began in
1878.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden said Saturday that Helene’s devastation has been
“overwhelming” and pledged to send help. He also approved a disaster
declaration for North Carolina, making federal funding available for
affected individuals.</p>
<p>With at least 25 killed in South Carolina, Helene is the deadliest
tropical cyclone for the state since Hurricane Hugo killed 35 people
when it came ashore just north of Charleston in 1989. Deaths also have
been reported in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia.</p>
<p>Moody’s Analytics said it expects $15 billion to $26 billion in
property damage. AccuWeather’s preliminary estimate of the total damage
and economic loss from Helene in the U.S. is between $95 billion and
$110 billion.</p>
<p>Evacuations began before the storm hit and continued as lakes
overtopped dams, including one in North Carolina that forms a lake
featured in the movie Dirty Dancing. Helicopters were used to rescue
some people from flooded homes.</p>
<p>Among the 11 confirmed deaths in Florida were nine people who drowned
in their homes in a mandatory evacuation area on the Gulf Coast in
Pinellas County, Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said.</p>
<p>None of the victims were from Taylor County, which is where the storm
made landfall. It came ashore near the mouth of the Aucilla River, about
30 kilometers northwest of where Hurricane Idalia hit last year at
nearly the same ferocity.</p>
<p>Taylor County is in Florida’s Big Bend, went years without taking a
direct hit from a hurricane. But after Idalia and two other storms in a
little over a year, the area is beginning to feel like a hurricane
superhighway.</p>
<p>“It’s bringing everybody to reality about what this is now with
disasters,” said John Berg, 76, a resident of Steinhatchee, a small
fishing town and weekend getaway.</p>
<p>Climate change has exacerbated conditions that allow such storms to
thrive, rapidly intensifying in warming waters and turning into powerful
cyclones sometimes in a matter of hours.</p>
<p>Helene was the eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season,
which began June 1. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
has predicted an above-average season this year because of record-warm
ocean temperatures.</p>

id="glock-pistols-popular-among-us-criminals-because-theyre-easily-modified-report-says">Glock
pistols popular among US criminals because they’re easily modified,
report says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BALTIMORE — Glock pistols are a popular choice for people committing
gun crimes, in part because they can be easily converted into fully
automatic weapons using a small device, according to a new report based
on data from nearly three dozen U.S. cities.</p>
<p>Often called Glock switches or auto sears, the devices have received
heightened attention in recent years because they’re increasingly
turning up at crime scenes. They effectively turn semiautomatic weapons,
which fire one bullet per trigger pull, into machine guns that can spray
continuous gunfire.</p>
<p>Authorities believe the shooters who killed four people and injured
17 others in Birmingham, Alabama, last weekend were using conversion
devices to make their guns more powerful. About 100 shell casings were
recovered from the scene.</p>
<p>A report by the anti-violence organization Everytown for Gun Safety
says criminals often choose Glocks because they’re relatively cheap and
easy to operate and modify. But the brand is perhaps best known for its
popularity among law enforcement officers, who almost exclusively carry
Glock handguns.</p>
<p>The report was released this week ahead of a conference Thursday in
Baltimore hosted by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a group that falls
under Everytown’s umbrella. The organization called on Glock and other
weapons manufacturers to take responsibility for their products and do
more to prevent violence.</p>
<p>“We have to build that level of accountability for them as well,”
Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said in an interview. “At some point, as a
country, the sanctity of the lives of Americans has to begin to outweigh
the sanctity of American guns.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Glock didn’t respond to an email seeking
comment.</p>
<p>Scott and other mayors said while local elected officials are often
at the forefront of pushing for better gun policies, Congress must also
step up and address the issue.</p>
<p>Researchers found that four gun manufacturers accounted for more than
40% of the recovered guns they studied, with Glock alone accounting for
18%. The team compiled data from 34 U.S. cities about guns recovered
from crime scenes in 2023.</p>
<p>“They’re basically profiting off of pain,” said John Feinblatt,
president of Everytown. “They’re prioritizing profits over safety.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the prevalence of machine gun conversion devices has
increased dramatically — 570% between 2017 and 2021, according to the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The devices are
banned under federal law. Most are small pieces of metal or plastic made
with a 3D printer or ordered online.</p>
<p>The report also found that recoveries of Polymer80 ghost guns —
untraceable, unassembled firearms that can be purchased online —
increased nearly 1,200% across 28 cities over the past five years. Those
numbers have started trending downward following the implementation of a
new federal rule and a wave of state legislation banning the weapons,
according to the report. Polymer80, once a leading manufacturer of ghost
guns in the U.S., also shut down operations last month after a deluge of
lawsuits.</p>
<p>The city of Baltimore was among those who filed suit. City officials
announced a settlement agreement in February after the Nevada-based
company agreed to stop selling its products to Maryland residents.</p>
<p>The city’s lawsuit accused Polymer80 of intentionally undermining
federal and state firearms laws by designing, manufacturing and
providing gun assembly kits without serial numbers to buyers who don’t
undergo background checks. It was filed the same day Maryland’s
statewide ban on ghost guns went into effect in 2022 following a law
change that expanded the definition of a firearm to include “an
unfinished frame or receiver.”</p>
<p>A year later, recoveries of ghost guns in Baltimore had dropped 25%,
according to the report.</p>
<p>Gun violence has also decreased significantly in the city over
roughly the past two years, a positive trend that experts and officials
attribute to a wide range of factors, including expanded anti-violence
programs and ongoing police reform. Violence is trending downward
nationally as well following a sharp spike during the COVID-19
pandemic.</p>
<p>The report suggests several actions that manufacturers could take to
keep their firearms out of the hands of criminals, including through
increased oversight of the gun dealers they work with. Manufacturers
could also focus on producing safer weapons that aren’t easily modified
and fund advertising campaigns to increase public awareness of gun
safety.</p>
<p>“I think common sense can get through to people. I think wanting to
save the lives of our children can get through to people,” said Kansas
City Mayor Quinton Lucas. “Manufacturers could do things tomorrow that
would make guns safer and save lives.”</p>

id="the-price-of-gold-keeps-climbing-to-unprecedented-heights.-heres-why">The
price of gold keeps climbing to unprecedented heights. Here’s why</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — The rush for gold just keeps coming.</p>
<p>Gold hit another all-time high this week. Recent gains for the
precious metal are largely credited to ongoing economic uncertainty,
geopolitical tensions and strong demand from central banks around the
world.</p>
<p>If trends continue, analysts have bullish outlooks on the price of
gold for the months ahead. But the future is never promised. Here’s what
you need to know.</p>
<p>Where does the price of gold stand today?</p>
<p>The New York spot price of gold closed Tuesday at just over $2,657
per Troy ounce — the standard for measuring precious metals, which is
equivalent to 31 grams — the highest recorded to date, per FactSet. That
would make a gold bar or brick weighing 400 Troy ounces worth more than
$1.06 million today.</p>
<p>This week’s record high means that the price of gold has climbed
hundreds of dollars per Troy ounce over the last year. Tuesday’s price
is up nearly $145 from a month ago and more than $740 from this time in
2023.</p>
<p>The price of gold is up nearly 30% year to date, analysts note —
outpacing the benchmark S&amp;P 500’s roughly 20% gain since the start
of 2024.</p>
<p>Why is the price of gold going up?</p>
<p>There are a few factors behind the recent gains.</p>
<p>Interest in buying gold often comes at times of uncertainty — with
potential concerns around inflation and the strength of the U.S. dollar,
for example, causing some to look for alternative places to park their
money. Gold also surged in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Among sources of uncertainty today are geopolitical tensions — which
escalated over recent days with Israel’s deadly strikes in Lebanon. And
the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine have continued to fuel fears about
the future worldwide.</p>
<p>In markets like the U.S., there’s also particular concern about the
health of the job market. Last week’s larger-than-usual half-point cut
by the Federal Reserve signals a new focus on slowing employment
numbers, and more rate cuts are expected before the end of the year. And
such action arrives in the midst of a tumultuous election year — which
could prove crucial to economic policy in the road ahead, too.</p>
<p>In the near future, people are considering “any case of turbulence in
the economy,” FxPro senior market analyst Michel Saliby explained. “This
is why they’re keeping a decent portion of gold in their portfolio as a
‘safe haven.’”</p>
<p>Analysts also point to strong demand from central banks around the
world. Joe Cavatoni, senior market strategist at the World Gold Council,
noted last month that central bank demand was well-above the five year
average — reflecting “heightened concern with inflation and economic
stability.”</p>
<p>Recent stimulus measures in China aimed at boosting consumer spending
are also expected to up retail investments, Saliby added, further
boosting gold’s performance.</p>
<p>Is gold worth the investment?</p>
<p>Advocates of investing in gold call it a “safe haven,” arguing the
commodity can serve to diversify and balance your investment portfolio,
as well as mitigate possible risks down the road. Some also take comfort
in buying something tangible that has the potential to increase in value
over time.</p>
<p>Experts caution against putting all your eggs in one basket.</p>
<p>Both retail and institutional investors shouldn’t be influenced by
the “FOMO effect,” or fear of missing out, Saliby notes — explaining
that people should not risk all their money just because they are seeing
others rake in gains. He advises investors to watch the market and
always have a clear risk management strategy for their position.</p>
<p>If geopolitical tensions cool, Saliby expects the price of gold to
correct slightly, perhaps falling around $50 to $80. But he remains
bullish overall for the near future — expecting gold’s spot price to
soon surpass the $2,700 mark previously predicted for 2025, and perhaps
reach as high as $2,800 or $2,900 if trends continue.</p>
<p>Still, future gains are never promised and not everyone agrees gold
is a good investment. Critics say gold isn’t always the inflation hedge
many say it is — and that there are more efficient ways to protect
against potential loss of capital, such as through derivative-based
investments.</p>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trade Commission has also previously warned
people to be wary of investing in gold. Precious metals can be highly
volatile, the commission said, and prices rise as demand goes up —
meaning “when economic anxiety or instability is high, the people who
typically profit from precious metals are the sellers.”</p>
<p>If you do choose to invest in gold, the commission adds, it’s
important to educate yourself on safe trading practices and be cautious
of potential scams and counterfeits on the market.</p>

imposes new fine, demands payments before letting X resume</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAO PAULO/BRASILIA BRAZIL — Brazil’s Supreme Court said on Friday
that social platform X still needs to pay just over $5 million in
pending fines, including a new one, before it will be allowed to resume
its service in the country, according to a court document. </p>
<p>Earlier this week, the Elon Musk-owned U.S. firm told the court it
had complied with orders to stop the spread of misinformation and asked
it to lift a ban on the platform. </p>
<p>But Judge Alexandre de Moraes responded on Friday with a ruling that
X and its legal representative in Brazil must still agree to pay a total
of $3.4 million in pending fines that were previously ordered by the
court. </p>
<p>In his decision, the judge said that the court can use resources
already frozen from X and Starlink accounts in Brazil, but to do so the
satellite company, also owned by Musk, had to drop its pending appeal
against the fund blockage.  </p>
<p>The judge also demanded a new $1.8 million fine related to a brief
period last week when X became available again for some users in
Brazil. </p>
<p>X, formerly known as Twitter, did not immediately respond to a
request for comment. </p>
<p>According to a person close to X, the tech firm will likely pay all
the fines but will consider challenging the fine that was imposed by the
court after the platform ban.  </p>
<p>X has been suspended since late August in Brazil, one of its largest
and most coveted markets, after Moraes ruled it had failed to comply
with orders related to restricting hate speech and naming a local legal
representative. </p>
<p>Musk, who had denounced the orders as censorship and called Moraes a
“dictator,” backed down and started to reverse his position last week,
when X lawyers said the platform tapped a local representative and would
comply with court rulings. </p>
<p>In Friday’s decision, Moraes said that X had proved it had now
blocked accounts as ordered by the court and had named the required
legal representative in Brazil.</p>

id="blinken-dismisses-chinas-ukraine-peace-plan-over-material-support-for-russia">Blinken
dismisses China’s Ukraine peace plan over material support for
Russia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that
China’s words and actions regarding ending Russia’s war on Ukraine do
not “add up,” as the Beijing government continues to allow Chinese
companies to “fuel Russia’s war machine.”</p>
<p>The United States and China are planning a call between President Joe
Biden and President Xi Jinping in the coming days, with China’s material
support for Russia in the war on Ukraine expected to be a key topic on
the U.S. agenda. </p>
<p>Friday afternoon, Blinken held talks with Chinese Foreign Minister
Wang Yi on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York.</p>
<p>Ukraine </p>
<p>Following talks that lasted more than an hour, Blinken told reporters
at a news conference that any peace plan to end Russia’s war on Ukraine
must be based on the principles of the U.N. Charter, particularly
territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence.</p>
<p>“A peace in which the aggressor gets everything that it sought, and
the victim does not have its rights upheld, is not a recipe for a
lasting peace, and certainly not a just one,” Blinken said when asked
about a peace proposal by China and Brazil.</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday, China and Brazil pushed forward with efforts to
rally developing countries behind a plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine,
despite Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s rejection of the
initiative, viewing it as favorable to Moscow’s interests.</p>
<p>The meeting between Blinken and Wang came amid growing U.S. concerns
over Chinese firms supplying semiconductor chips and drones to Moscow,
which have significantly bolstered Russia’s battlefield capabilities in
its war against Ukraine.</p>
<p>Blinken said, “Roughly 70% of the machine tools that Russia’s
importing, coming from China, Hong Kong.  Ninety percent of the
microelectronics, from China, Hong Kong.  And this is materially helping
the Russians produce the missiles, the rockets, the armored vehicles,
the munitions that they need to perpetuate the war, to continue their
aggression.”</p>
<p>In New York, Wang told reporters that China had discussed with other
countries the importance of preventing escalation in Russia’s war on
Ukraine.</p>
<p>“Russia and Ukraine are neighbors that cannot be moved away from each
other and amity is the only realistic option,” Wang said, emphasizing
that other nations should support an international peace conference
involving Russia and Ukraine. </p>
<p>Taiwan</p>
<p>On Friday, Blinken said he also “emphasized the importance of
maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait” during the
meeting with his Chinese counterpart.</p>
<p>Rick Waters, former deputy assistant secretary of state for China and
Taiwan, said the United States and China share an interest in
maintaining diplomatic and military communication.</p>
<p>“You’re not going to resolve disputes over Taiwan or the South China
Sea in those channels, but I don’t think either leader wants a military
mishap to put them in a corner where they might have to contend with
escalation or, even worse, conflict,” Waters, now managing director of
Eurasia Group’s China practice, said in a recent interview with VOA.</p>
<p>The People’s Republic of China (PRC) will celebrate its National Day
on Tuesday, commemorating the founding of the country in 1949.</p>
<p>Taiwan celebrates October 10, known as “Double 10,” as the
anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China (ROC) in 1912. The
Republic of China is Taiwan’s formal name.</p>
<p>Taiwan has been self-ruled since 1949, when Mao Zedong’s communists
took power in Beijing after defeating Chiang Kai-shek’s Kuomintang
nationalists in a civil war, prompting the nationalists’ relocation to
the island.</p>
<p>PRC leaders usually carefully watch the speeches from leaders in
Taiwan during its Double 10 celebrations.</p>
<p>Since Taiwan’s democratically elected President Lai Ching-te took
office in May, Beijing has increased military pressure against Taiwan.
The PRC has deemed Lai a separatist.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have stressed to their Chinese counterparts that the
more pressure China applies to Taiwan, the more it risks pushing Taiwan
further away, according to sources familiar with recent diplomatic
discussions between Washington and Beijing.</p>
<p>Analysts indicate they do not expect Lai to advocate for issues
considered taboo by China in the coming months.</p>
<p>“Taiwan President Lai has been quite careful not to touch China’s red
lines in his public remarks since becoming the president of Taiwan,”
Dennis Wilder, senior fellow for the Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue
on Global Issues at Georgetown University, told VOA. “I would guess that
he will try again to reach out to Beijing and do not expect him to push
independence themes.”</p>
<p>Wilder added, “The Chinese leadership came to the conclusion long ago
that because of Lai’s deep green background they would never be able to
trust him. Thus, there is very little he can do, as was the case as well
with former President Tsai [Ing-wen], to convince Beijing that they
should improve cross-strait relations while he is in office.” He was
referring to Taiwan’s political coalition known for its pro-independence
platform.</p>

<h2 id="harris-visits-border-patrol-leaders-in-arizona">Harris visits
Border Patrol leaders in Arizona</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DOUGLAS, Arizona — U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris walked a scrubby
stretch of fence line along Arizona’s border with Mexico on Friday,
seeking to project an image of strength against illegal migration as she
confronts one of her biggest vulnerabilities in the November
election.</p>
<p>In her first trip to the international boundary since becoming the
Democratic presidential nominee, Harris chatted with local Border Patrol
leaders as they strode along a rust-colored stretch of wall built during
Barack Obama’s presidency. Temperatures in Douglas, Arizona, neared 37.7
degrees Celsius during a conversation that lasted about half an
hour.</p>
<p>“They’ve got a tough job, and they need, rightly, support to do their
job,” Harris said of the Border Patrol as she entered the Douglas port
of entry for a briefing on efforts to block the flow of fentanyl across
the border. “They are very dedicated. And so I’m here to talk with them
about what we can continue to do to support them. And also thank them
for the hard work they do.”</p>
<p>Later, she was expected to call for further tightening asylum
restrictions, moving beyond President Joe Biden’s policy on an issue
where her rival, former President Donald Trump, has an edge with voters.
Hundreds of people packed into a gymnasium to hear her speak.</p>
<p>Trump and his fellow Republicans have pounded Harris relentlessly
over the Biden administration’s record on migration and fault the vice
president for spending little time visiting the border during her time
in the White House.</p>
<p>Harris will outline her plan to crack down further on asylum claims
and keep the restrictions in place longer compared with the executive
order that Biden signed this summer, according to a campaign official
who spoke on condition of anonymity because Harris had not yet made the
announcement. The official briefed reporters aboard Air Force 2 en route
to Arizona.</p>
<p>Harris arrived by helicopter in Douglas, where she met with Mayor
Donald Huish, Cochise County Sheriff Mark Dannels and County Supervisor
Ann English, along with Senator Mark Kelly and Attorney General Kris
Mayes.</p>
<p>Immigration and border security are top issues in Arizona, the only
battleground state that borders Mexico and one that contended with a
record influx of asylum-seekers last year. Voters favor Trump on
migration, and Harris has gone on offense to improve her standing on the
issue and defuse a key line of political attack for Trump.</p>
<p>In nearly every campaign speech she gives, Harris recounts how a
sweeping bipartisan package aiming to overhaul the federal immigration
system collapsed in Congress earlier this year after Trump urged top
Republicans to oppose it.</p>
<p>“The American people deserve a president who cares more about border
security than playing political games,” Harris plans to say, according
to an excerpt of her remarks previewed by her campaign.</p>
<p>After the immigration legislation stalled, the Biden administration
announced rules that bar migrants from being granted asylum when U.S.
officials deem that the southern border is overwhelmed. Since then,
arrests for illegal border crossings have fallen.</p>
<p>Harris will also use her trip to remind voters about her work as
attorney general of California in confronting crime along the border.
During an August rally in Glendale, outside Phoenix, she talked about
helping to prosecute drug- and people-smuggling gangs that operated
transnationally and at the border.</p>
<p>“I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won,” Harris said
then.</p>
<p>The vice president’s trip to Douglas thrusts the issue of immigration
into the brightest spotlight yet less than six weeks before Election
Day.</p>
<p>Trump didn’t wait for her to arrive there before pushing back. He
pointed Friday to purported data about criminals entering the U.S.
illegally in a bid to link Harris to violent crimes committed by
migrants. In a scathing diatribe, he said “blood is on her hands.”</p>
<p>“These are hard, tough, vicious criminals that are free to roam in
our country,” Trump said at a manufacturing plant in Michigan.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, he told voters that “when Kamala speaks about
the border, her credibility is less than zero.”</p>
<p>The Trump campaign has also countered with its own TV ads deriding
the vice president as a failed “border czar.”</p>
<p>“Under Harris, over 10 million illegally here,” said one spot.
However, estimates on how many people have entered the country illegally
since the start of the Biden administration in 2021 vary widely.</p>
<p>Harris also never held the position of border czar. Instead, her
assignment was to tackle the “root causes” of migration from three
Central American nations — El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras — that
were responsible for a significant share of border crossers.</p>
<p>The vice president took a long-term approach to an immediate problem,
helping persuade multinational corporations and Latin American
businesses to invest in the region. That, she argued, would create jobs
and give locals more reasons to stay home rather than take the arduous
trek north.</p>
<p>Still, Trump has continued to decry an “invasion” of border
crossers.</p>
<p>Douglas, where Harris appeared, is an overwhelmingly Democratic
border town in GOP-dominated Cochise County, where the Republicans on
the board of supervisors are facing criminal charges for refusing to
certify the 2022 election results. Trump was in the area last month,
using a remote stretch of border wall and a pile of steel beams to draw
a contrast between himself and Harris on border security.</p>
<p>The town of 16,000 people has strong ties to its much larger
neighbor, Agua Prieta, Mexico, and a busy port of entry that’s slated
for a long-sought upgrade. Many locals are as concerned with making
legal border crossings more efficient as they are with combatting
illegal ones.</p>
