rescued from Colorado gold mine where elevator mishap killed 1
person</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>denver — Twelve people were rescued Thursday night after being
trapped for about six hours at the bottom of a former Colorado gold mine
when an elevator malfunctioned at the tourist site, authorities said.
One person died in the accident.</p>
<p>The elevator was descending into the Mollie Kathleen Gold Mine near
the town of Cripple Creek when it had a mechanical problem around 150
meters beneath the surface, creating a “severe danger for the
participants,” and one person was killed, Teller County Sheriff Jason
Mikesell said.</p>
<p>The 12 adults who were trapped were about 305 meters below ground,
but they had access to water and the atmosphere was considered good.
They were safe and in communication with authorities with radios while
waiting, Mikesell said.</p>
<p>They were in good spirits after they were rescued, and authorities
gave them pizza once they were out and told them everything that had
happened, he said. While at the bottom, authorities had told them only
that there was an elevator issue.</p>
<p>Mikesell said during a nighttime briefing that authorities do not
know yet what caused the malfunction and an investigation is underway.
Engineers worked to make sure the elevator was working safely again
before bringing the stranded visitors back up on it. They had been
prepared to bring them up by rope if necessary, had they not been able
to get the elevator fixed.</p>
<p>Mikesell declined to reveal the identification of the victim.</p>
<p>The incident, which was reported to authorities at about noon,
happened during the final week of the Mollie Kathleen Gold Mine season
before it shuts down for the winter, Mikesell said.</p>
<p>Earlier in the afternoon — while the 12 were stuck at the bottom — 11
other people who were riding the elevator were rescued. Four had minor
injuries. The sheriff did not elaborate on how they were injured.</p>
<p>The elevator ride typically takes about two minutes, travelling about
152 meters per minute, according to the mine’s website.</p>
<p>Mikesell said the last time there was an incident was in the 1980s
when a couple of people were trapped on the elevator. Nobody died in
that incident.</p>
<p>Mines that operate as tourist attractions in Colorado must designate
someone to inspect the mines and the transportation systems daily,
according to the state Division of Reclamation, Mining and Safety.
Mikesell said he didn’t know the date of the last inspection. Records of
the inspections weren’t immediately available online.</p>
<p>Gov. Jared Polis sent state resources including a mine rescue
team.</p>
<p>Cripple Creek is a town of about 1,100 in the Rocky Mountains
southwest of Colorado Springs.</p>
<p>The mine opened in the 1800s and closed in 1961, but still operates
tours. Its website describes a one-hour tour in which visitors descend
304 meters. It says they can see veins of gold in the rock and ride an
underground tram.</p>
<p>A woman named Mollie Kathleen Gortner discovered the site of the mine
in 1891 when she saw quartz laced with gold, according to the company’s
website.</p>

id="afghan-charged-in-election-day-terror-plot-passed-multiple-screenings">Afghan
charged in Election Day terror plot passed multiple screenings</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The Afghan national charged in a plot to carry out an
Election Day terror attack in the United States passed multiple
background checks before being allowed to enter the country, U.S.
officials told VOA.</p>
<p>FBI agents arrested Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, 27, in Oklahoma City,
Oklahoma, on Monday, alleging he and a juvenile co-conspirator had been
in contact with a recruiter for the Islamic State terror group and had
been planning to die in a mass shooting.</p>
<p>Court documents also stated that Tawhedi hoped to relocate most of
his family, including his wife and 1-year-old daughter, back to
Afghanistan to live according to what he described as “pure Islam.”</p>
<p>However, U.S. officials, speaking to VOA on the condition of
anonymity to discuss details of a case still under investigation, said
Thursday that there were no indications Tawhedi was sympathetic to the
Islamic State, also known as IS, ISIS or Daesh, either when he worked
for the United States in Afghanistan or when he was screened immediately
before to coming to the U.S. three years ago.</p>
<p>“Every Afghan being resettled in the United States undergoes a
rigorous screening and vetting process, no matter which [U.S.] agency
they worked with,” the official said.</p>
<p>“That process includes checking against a full range of relevant U.S.
records and holdings,” the official added. “Tawhedi would not have been
admitted to the United States had information of concern surfaced.”</p>
<p>Kinds of data</p>
<p>A second U.S. official told VOA that Tawhedi’s vetting included
checks that involved both biometric data collected by the U.S.
Department of Defense and the FBI, and classified information held by
U.S. intelligence agencies.</p>
<p>Subsequent screenings that allowed him to be approved for a Special
Immigrant Visa after he entered the U.S. also came up clean.</p>
<p>“Vetting is a point-in-time check that evaluates information
available to the U.S. government at that time,” the official said.</p>
<p>The second official also said the government can take additional
actions “if individuals who have entered the country are later found to
be associated with information indicating a potential national security
or public safety concern.”</p>
<p>NBC News, which first reported that Tawhedi’s background checks
failed to detect any red flags, quoted sources as saying he had worked
as a security guard for the CIA before being resettled in the U.S.</p>
<p>When reached by VOA, the CIA declined comment.</p>
<p>But the arrest has raised concerns among some U.S. lawmakers.</p>
<p>The chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Republican
Representative Mark Green, sent a letter Wednesday to the FBI and the
Department of Homeland Security demanding more information.</p>
<p>“These recent arrests raise serious concerns about the ongoing threat
that ISIS and its fanatical supporters pose to U.S. national security,
as well as the shortfall in the Biden-Harris administration’s screening
and vetting capabilities,” Green wrote.</p>
<p>“Additionally, news of these potential Afghan terrorists comes when
only months ago, it was widely reported that eight Tajikistanis with
ties to ISIS were arrested in Los Angeles, New York and Philadelphia
after they had illegally crossed the border,” Green added.</p>
<p>The FBI confirmed receipt of Green’s letter but declined further
comment.</p>
<p>A Homeland Security spokesperson did not comment on the letter but
described the vetting process for Afghans fleeing Taliban rule as
“multilayered.”</p>
<p>“Afghan evacuees who sought to enter the United States were subject
to multilayered screening and vetting against intelligence, law
enforcement and counterterrorism information,” the spokesperson told VOA
in an email. “If new information emerges after arrival, appropriate
action is taken.”</p>
<p>When was he radicalized?</p>
<p>But in the case of Tawhedi, questions remain.</p>
<p>“What’s not clear from the information currently available is exactly
when Tawhedi was radicalized to the Islamic State ideology,” said Austin
Doctor, the director of counterterrorism research initiatives at the
National Counterterrorism Innovation, Technology and Education Center
(NCITE).</p>
<p>“We don’t know yet whether he radicalized after arriving to the
United States or if he already held pro-ISIS beliefs prior to leaving
Afghanistan,” Doctor told VOA. “This matters.”</p>
<p>According to court documents, a search of Tawhedi’s phone and social
media accounts showed he had been doing internet searches to find and
consume IS propaganda, though when that started is not clear.</p>
<p>The earliest date for any involvement with IS, according to the
criminal complaint filed Monday, is sometime around March of this year,
when Tawhedi made two cryptocurrency transfers worth at least $540 to
what prosecutors described as a charity that fronts for IS.</p>
<p>About four months later, in July, someone made a video recording –
saved to Tawhedi’s phone – of Tawhedi reading to a nephew and his
daughter about the rewards waiting for martyrs in the afterlife.</p>
<p>The first indications of a possible terror plot emerged that same
month, when the FBI said Tawhedi did online searches about webcams for
the White House and the Washington Monument, as well as about procuring
guns.</p>
<p>It also remains unclear whether Tawhedi’s Islamic State contact was
working for the group’s Afghan affiliate, known as IS-Khorasan or
ISIS-K.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen ISIS-K make a concerted effort to recruit from diaspora
communities,” NCITE’s Doctor told VOA. “And facilitating external
operations and inspiring homegrown violent extremist attacks are both
prominent elements of the group’s playbook.”</p>

Forces Storm-Wrecked Homeowners to Choose: Build Up or Move Out?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-10, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzgwMDM2NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2OTQ0OTMyMX0.Tj1Z5dbJjVvQd1fziiA-uKZ00NAmrqLgXsQ1lw6niC4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
After the storm, we rebuild. That’s the mantra repeated by residents,
businesses and elected officials after any big storm. Hurricane Milton
may have avoided the worst case scenario of a direct hit on the Tampa
Bay area, but communities south of Tampa experienced heavy flooding just
a couple weeks after being hit by Hurricane Helene.
</p>
<p>
While the damage is still being assessed in Sarasota County’s barrier
islands, homes that require extensive renovations will almost certainly
run up against what is known as the 50% rule — or, in Southwest Florida,
the
“<a href="https://www.swflappraisals.com/fema-fifty-percent-rule/#:~:text=And%20the%2050%25%20rule%20states,most%20recent%20flood%20prevention%20regulations." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>dreaded</u></a>
50% rule.”
</p>
<p>
In flood zone-situated communities eligible to receive insurance from
the National Flood Insurance Program, any renovations to repair
“substantial damage” — defined as repairs whose cost exceeds 50% of the
value of the structure (not the land, which can often be quite valuable
due to its proximity to the water) — must bring the entire structure
“into compliance with current local floodplain management standards.” In
practice, this typically means elevating the home above what FEMA
defines as the area’s
“<a href="https://www.fema.gov/about/glossary/base-flood-elevation-bfe#:~:text=The%20elevation%20of%20surface%20water,%2C%20V1%E2%80%93V30%20and%20VE." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>base
flood elevation</u></a>,” which is the level that a “100-year-flood”
would reach, plus some amount determined by the building code.
</p>
<p>
The rule almost invites conflict. Because just as much as local
communities and homeowners want to restore things to the way they were,
the federal government doesn’t want to insure structures that are simply
going to get destroyed. On Siesta Key, where Milton made landfall, the
base flood elevation ranges from 7 feet to 9 feet, meaning that
elevating a home to comply with flood codes could be beyond the means —
or at least the insurance payouts — of some homeowners.
</p>
<p>
“You got a 1952 house that’s 1,400 square feet, and you get 4 feet of
water,” Jeff Brandes, a former state legislator and president of the
Florida Policy Project, told me on Wednesday, explaining how the rule
could have played out in Tampa. “That means new kitchens and new
bathrooms, all new flooring and baseboards and drywall to 4 or 5 feet.”
That kind of claim could easily run to $150,000, which might well
surpass the FEMA threshold. “Now all of the sudden you get into the 50%
rule that you have the entire house up to current code levels. But then
you have to do another half-a-million above what [insurance] paid you.”
</p>
<p>
Simple probability calculations show that a 100-year flood (which is
really a flood elevation that has a 1-in-100 chance of occurring every
year) has a more than 25% chance of occurring during the lifetime of a
mortgage. If you browse Siesta Key real estate on Zillow, much of it is
given a 100% chance of flooding sometime over the course of a 30-year
mortgage, according to data analysis by First Street.
</p>
<p>
Sarasota County as a whole has around 62,000 NFIP policies with some
$16.6 billion in total coverage (although more than 80% percent of
households have
<a href="https://www.harrisinsurance.com/sarasota-fl-flood-insurance-coverage/#:~:text=Not%20acquiring%20flood%20insurance%20in,do%20not%20have%20flood%20insurance." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>no
flood insurance at all)</u></a>. Considering that flood insurance is
<a href="https://www.floodsmart.gov/am-i-required-have-flood-insurance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>required</u></a>
in high-risk areas for federally-backed mortgages and for new homeowners
insurance policies
<a href="https://www.pnj.com/story/money/2024/03/15/citizens-mandatory-flood-insurance/72978182007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>written
by Florida’s state backed property insurer of last resort</u></a>,
Citizens, FEMA is likely to take a close interest in whether communities
affected by Milton and Helene are complying with its rules.<br/>
</p>
<p>
If 2022’s Hurricane Ian is any indication, squabbles over the 50% rule
are almost certain to emerge — and soon.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year,
<a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/04/lee-county-fema-flood-zone-construction-50-percent-rule/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>FEMA
told Lee County</u></a>, which includes Fort Myers and Cape Coral, that
it was rescinding the discount its residents and a handful of towns
within it receive on flood insurance because, the agency claimed, more
than 600 homeowners had violated the 50% rule after Hurricane Ian.
Following an outcry from local officials and congressional
representatives,
<a href="https://winknews.com/2024/07/19/cape-coral-keeps-fema-flood-discount/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>FEMA
restored the discount</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
In their efforts to avoid triggering the rule, homeowners are hardly
rogue actors. Local governments often actively assist them.
</p>
<p>
FEMA had initiated a similar procedure in Lee County the year before,
threatening to drop homeowners from the flood insurance program for
using possibly inaccurate appraisals to avoid the 50% rule before
<a href="https://www.news-press.com/story/news/local/2023/02/22/fema-50-percent-rule-lee-county-florida-appraiser-property-values-allowed-hurricane-ian/69933389007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>eventually
relenting</u></a>. The <em><em>Fort Myers News Press</em></em> reported
that the appraisals were provided by the county, which was deliberately
“lowering the amount that residents could use to calculate their repairs
or rebuilds” to avoid triggering the rule.
</p>
<p>
Less than a month after Ian swept through Southwest Florida, Cape Coral
advised residents to
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/CityofCapeCoral/posts/pfbid0213LAr9too6BDBe24yDiDhdMiKPU3z9Eehk99eLPGQLpcco58oXeN8DinvYFzRG3Sl" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>delay
and slow down repairs</u></a> for the same reason, as the rule there
applied to money spent on repairs over the course of a year. Some
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=treasury+island+lookback+period&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS940US940&oq=treasury+island+lookback+period&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIJCAEQIRgKGKABMgkIAhAhGAoYoAEyCQgDECEYChigATIJCAQQIRgKGKABMgcIBRAhGKsCMgcIBhAhGKsCMgcIBxAhGKsC0gEINTE2OGowajeoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#:~:text=Belleair%20Beach%20homeowners,news%20%E2%80%BA%20local%20%E2%80%BA%20pinellascounty" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>highly
exposed coastal communities</u></a> in Pinellas County have been
adjusting their “lookback rules” — the period over which repairs are
totaled to see if they hit the 50% rule — to make them shorter so
homeowners are less likely to have to make the substantive repairs
<a href="https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/local/pinellascounty/homes-lookback-period-repair/67-15fadaa0-bf77-4399-9a1c-f65f285b3b49" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>required</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
This followed similar actions by local governments in Charlotte County.
As the <em><em>Punta Gordon Sun</em></em> put it, “City Council members
learned the federal regulation impacts its homeowners — and they decided
to do something about it.” In the Sarasota County community of North
Port, local officials
<a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/local/venice/2022/11/23/hurricane-ian-recovery-north-port-eases-rules-rebuild-floods/10761279002/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>scrapped
a rule</u></a> that added up repair costs over a five-year period to
make it possible for homeowners to rebuild without triggering elevation
requirements.
</p>
<p>
When the 50% rule “works,” it can lead to the communities most affected
by big storms being fundamentally changed, both in terms of the
structures that are built and who occupies them.The end result of the
rebuilding following Helene and Milton — or the next big storm to hit
Florida’s Gulf Coast — or the one after that, and so on — may be
wealthier homeowners in more resilient homes essentially serving as a
flood barrier for everyone else, and picking up more of the bill if the
waters rise too high again.
</p>
<p>
Florida’s Gulf Coast has long been seen as a place where the middle
class can afford beachfront property. Elected officials’ resistance to
the FEMA rule only goes to show just how important keeping a lid on the
cost of living — quite literally, the cost of legally inhabiting a
structure — is to the voters and residents they represent.
</p>
<p>
Still, said Brandes, “There’s the right way to come out of this thing.
The wrong way is to build exactly back what you built before.”

<h2 id="what-happens-to-a-landfill-in-a-hurricane">What Happens to a
Landfill in a Hurricane?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-10, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzgwMDIxMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NjQ2OTkyN30.2B4I1U8C-uMyLHuj5ZYyPuRmBDBztHHT_wPNFkCoTPc/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
In the coming days and weeks, as Floridians and others in storm-ravaged
communities clean up from Hurricane Milton, trucks will carry all manner
of storm-related detritus — chunks of buildings, fences, furniture, even
cars — to the same place all their other waste goes: the local landfill.
But what about the landfill itself? Does this gigantic trash pile take
to the air and scatter Dorito bags and car parts alike around the
surrounding region?
</p>
<p>
No, thankfully. As Richard Meyers, the director of land management
services at the Solid Waste Authority of Palm Beach County, assured me,
all landfill waste is covered with soil on “at least a weekly basis,”
and certainly right before a hurricane, preventing the waste from being
kicked up. “Aerodynamically, [the storm is] rolling over that covered
waste. It’s not able to blow six inches of cover soil from the top of
the waste.”
</p>
<p>
But just because a landfill won’t turn into a mass of airborne dirt and
half-decomposed projectiles doesn’t mean there’s nothing to worry about.
Because landfills — especially large ones — often contain more advanced
infrastructure such as gas collection systems, which prevent methane
from being vented into the atmosphere, and drainage systems, which
collect contaminated liquid that’s pooled at the bottom of the waste
pile and send it off for treatment. Meyers told me that getting these
systems back online after a storm if they’ve been damaged is “the most
critical part, from our standpoint.”
</p>
<p>
A flood-inundated gas collection system can mean more methane escaping
into the air, and storm-damaged drainage pipes can lead to waste liquids
leaking into the ground and potentially polluting water sources. The
latter was a
<a href="https://www.rd.usda.gov/newsroom/news-release/usda-rural-development-awards-municipality-juncos-grant-23693000-repair-landfill" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>major
concern in Puerto Rico</u></a> after Hurricane Maria destroyed a
landfill’s waste liquid collection system in the Municipality of Juncos
in 2017.
</p>
<p>
As for methane, calculating exactly how much could be released as a
result of a dysfunctional landfill gas collection system requires
accounting for myriad factors such as the composition of the waste and
the climate that it’s in, but the back of the envelope calculations
don’t look promising. The
<a href="https://ghgdata.epa.gov/ghgp/service/facilityDetail/2022?id=1003560&ds=E&et=&popup=true" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Southeast
County Landfill near Tampa</u></a>, for instance, emitted about 100,000
metric tons of CO2 equivalent in 2022, according to the Environmental
Protection Agency (although a Harvard engineering study from earlier
this year suggests that this may be a
<a href="https://seas.harvard.edu/news/2024/05/epa-underestimates-methane-emissions-landfills-urban-areas#:~:text=Research%20highlights%20importance%20of%20high%2Dresolution%20methane%20accounting&text=The%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency%20(EPA,27%25%20higher%20than%20EPA%20estimates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>significant
underestimate</u></a>). The EPA estimates that gas collection systems
are about 75% effective, which means that the landfill generates a total
of about 400,000 metric tons of CO2-worth of methane. If Southeast
County Landfill’s gas collection system were to go down completely for
even a day, that would mean extra methane emissions of roughly 822
metric tons of CO2 equivalent. That difference amounts to the daily
emissions of more than 65,000 cars.
</p>
<p>
That’s a lot of math. But the takeaway is: Big landfills in the pathway
of a destructive storm could end up spewing a lot of methane into the
atmosphere. And keep in mind that these numbers are just for
<em><em>one</em></em> hypothetical landfill with a gas collection system
that goes down for <em><em>one</em></em> day. The emissions numbers, you
can imagine, start to look much worse if you consider the possibility
that floodwaters could impede access to infrastructure for even longer.
</p>
<p>
So stay strong out there, landfills of Florida. You may not be the star
of this show, but you’ve got our attention.

<h2 id="hurricane-disinformation-leads-to-danger-experts-say">Hurricane
disinformation leads to danger, experts say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Disinformation and conspiracy theories have spread
quickly in response to natural disasters in the southeastern United
States, creating distrust in the government response, according to the
head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</p>
<p>“It is absolutely the worst I have ever seen,” FEMA Administrator
Deanne Criswell told reporters on a Tuesday call.</p>
<p>The spread of lies surrounding the natural disasters comes at a time
when social media infrastructure will allow “virtually any claim” to
amplify and spread, experts say.</p>
<p>Hurricane Helene left more than 200 people dead and many more injured
or without power, and Hurricane Milton has left at least four dead after
ravaging Florida, according to the Associated Press.</p>
<p>Some frequently spread falsehoods include accusations that FEMA
prevented Florida evacuations and claims that funding for storm victims
was instead given to undocumented migrants.</p>
<p>Such misinformation is “demoralizing” to first responders, Criswell
said in the press call.</p>
<p>Additionally, the fabrications could put first responders and
residents of impacted areas in even more danger, according to Matthew
Baum, a Harvard University professor who focuses on fake news and
misinformation.</p>
<p>“When you’re talking about life-and-death situations,
[misinformation] can cause people not to take advantage of help that’s
available to them, and it can also be dangerous for first responders who
are being accused of all sorts of badness,” Baum told VOA. “And if first
responders start to worry about their own safety, that’s going to
undermine how they do their jobs.”</p>
<p>Many of the other falsehoods stem from former President Donald
Trump’s campaign and allies.</p>
<p>In an October 3 rally, the former president falsely claimed that the
Biden-Harris administration was diverting FEMA funding to house illegal
migrants.</p>
<p>Last week, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from
Georgia, claimed that “they control the weather” in a post on social
media platform X, formerly Twitter. She did not specify who “they”
are.</p>
<p>To combat popular conspiracies surrounding hurricane relief efforts,
FEMA launched a “Hurricane Rumor Response” webpage to “help correct
rumors and provide accurate information,” according to a press
release.</p>
<p>Baum, however, told VOA that those who believe the false claims may
not be swayed by the government-funded website, as they are already
“deep down the rabbit hole of conspiratorial thinking.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think the website will have a significant effect, but it’s
still worth doing because journalists read it and having that
information out there gets it into the news ecosystem,” Baum said. “But
fundamentally, it’s not likely to reach many of the people that are at
risk of being harmed by this disinformation.”</p>
<p>FEMA put up a similar rumor response webpage during the 2020
coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>On social media platforms such as X, misinformation tends to spread
faster than true stories, a 2018 MIT study found. False news stories are
70% more likely to be reposted than true ones are.</p>
<p>Media scholar Matt Jordan told VOA the vast amount of disinformation
circulating is part of a “firehose of falsehood” strategy, in which bad
actors publish so much “garbage” that people don’t know what to
believe.</p>
<p>“It’s a way of eliminating the capacity for the press to help
generate democratic consensus by just putting so much garbage into the
zone,” the Penn State professor said.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden said during a Tuesday morning briefing that
this misinformation “misleads” the public.</p>
<p>“It’s un-American, it really is,” he said in his remarks. “People are
scared to death; people know their lives are at stake.”</p>

id="blinken-builds-ties-with-thailand-malaysia-after-turbulence">Blinken
builds ties with Thailand, Malaysia after turbulence</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>VIENTIANE, LAOS — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken voiced hope
Thursday for cooperation with Thailand and Malaysia after recent
turbulence as he met their prime ministers at an Asia summit.</p>
<p>In a shift of focus after exhaustive diplomacy on the Middle East
crisis, Blinken is representing the United States in Laos at the annual
East Asia Summit, which President Joe Biden is skipping for the second
straight year.</p>
<p>Blinken met Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the
38-year-old heir of a political dynasty who took over a month ago after
her predecessor was ousted and the main opposition party dissolved.</p>
<p>Blinken said the United States hoped to work with Shinawatra to
“focus on things that we can do to better the lives of our people,”
including on the economy, security and climate change.</p>
<p>“The two countries have such an extraordinary history together, and
we simply want to build on it,” Blinken told her.</p>
<p>Shinawatra told Blinken of northern Thailand’s recent deadly floods
and voiced support for long-term relations with the United States.</p>
<p>Thailand is the oldest U.S. ally in Asia, but Washington has
repeatedly criticized its record on democracy, although usually
gently.</p>
<p>The State Department voiced alarm in August after a Thai court
dissolved the reformist Move Forward Party and banned from politics the
kingdom’s most popular politician, Pita Limjaroenrat.</p>
<p>Blinken, wearing a dark blue, traditional Laotian jacket, later met
separately with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who has been a
vocal critic of U.S. support for Israel.</p>
<p>Neither mentioned the Middle East in brief remarks in the presence of
reporters, with Blinken instead noting that the United States is the top
foreign investor in Malaysia.</p>
<p>“I think this is a tremendous sign of both trust and confidence,
because the investments don’t happen unless there’s tremendous
confidence in the country,” Blinken told Anwar.</p>
<p>U.S. officials privately say that they understand the political
pressure in the Muslim-majority country and that they seek a cooperative
relationship with Anwar, who enjoyed strong advocacy from Washington
when he was controversially imprisoned.</p>
<p>Thailand has taken a lead at the Laos summit in seeking diplomatic
progress on the crisis engulfing its neighbor Myanmar, whose military
junta sent a representative to a top-level Southeast Asian gathering for
the first time in more than three years.</p>
<p>The United States, while backing diplomatic efforts, said it would
press for sustained pressure on the junta, seeing no progress on key
concerns such as freeing political prisoners and reducing violence.</p>
<p>Blinken, who met two weeks ago with his Chinese counterpart in New
York, will also back efforts by Southeast Asia to raise concerns with
Beijing about its actions in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>The summit marks a rare occasion in which Blinken is in the same room
as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, but no talks between the two
are expected.</p>
<p>The Biden administration, including presidential nominee Vice
President Kamala Harris, has ruled out talks with Russia on its invasion
of Ukraine without involving Kyiv.</p>

id="ethel-kennedy-social-activist-and-widow-of-robert-f.-kennedy-dies-at-96">Ethel
Kennedy, social activist and widow of Robert F. Kennedy, dies at 96</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Boston, Massachusetts — Ethel Kennedy, the widow of Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy who raised their 11 children after he was assassinated and
remained dedicated to social causes and the family’s legacy for decades
thereafter, died on Thursday, her family said. She was 96.</p>
<p>Kennedy had been hospitalized after suffering a stroke in her sleep
on Oct. 3, her family said.</p>
<p>“It is with our hearts full of love that we announce the passing of
our amazing grandmother,” Joe Kennedy III posted on X. “She died this
morning from complications related to a stroke suffered last week.”</p>
<p>“Along with a lifetime’s work in social justice and human rights, our
mother leaves behind nine children, 34 grandchildren and 24 great-great
grandchildren along with numerous nieces and nephews, all of whom love
her dearly,” the family statement said.</p>
<p>The Kennedy matriarch, whose children were Kathleen, Joseph II,
Robert Jr., David, Courtney, Michael, Kerry, Christopher, Max, Douglas
and Rory, was one of the last remaining members of a generation that
included President John F. Kennedy. Her family said she had recently
enjoyed seeing many of her relatives, before falling ill.</p>
<p>A millionaire’s daughter who married the future senator and attorney
general in 1950, Ethel Kennedy had endured more death by the age of 40,
for the whole world to see, than most would in a lifetime.</p>
<p>She was by Robert F. Kennedy’s side when he was fatally shot in the
kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 5, 1968, just
after winning the Democratic presidential primary in California. Her
brother-in-law, President John F. Kennedy, had been assassinated in
Dallas less than five years earlier.</p>
<p>Her parents were killed in a plane crash in 1955, and her brother
died in a 1966 crash. Her son David Kennedy later died of a drug
overdose, son Michael Kennedy in a skiing accident and nephew John F.
Kennedy Jr. in a plane crash. Another nephew, Michael Skakel, was found
guilty of murder in 2002, although a judge in 2013 ordered a new trial
and the Connecticut Supreme Court vacated his conviction in 2018.</p>
<p>In 2019, she was grieving again after granddaughter Saoirse Kennedy
Hill died of an apparent drug overdose.</p>
<p>“One wonders how much this family must be expected to absorb,” family
friend Philip Johnson, founder of the Robert F. Kennedy Foundation, told
the Boston Herald after Michael Kennedy’s death.</p>
<p>Ethel Kennedy sustained herself through her faith and devotion to
family.</p>
<p>“She was a devout Catholic and a daily communicant, and we are
comforted in knowing she is reunited with the love of her life, our
father, Robert. F. Kennedy; her children David and Michael; her
daughter-in-law Mary; her grandchildren Maeve and Saorise and her
great-grandchildren Gideon and Josie. Please keep our mother in your
hearts and prayers,” the family statement said.</p>
<p>Ethel’s mother-in-law, Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, initially worried
about how she would handle so much tragedy.</p>
<p>“I knew how difficult it was going to be for her to raise that big
family without the guiding role and influence that Bobby would have
provided,” Rose recalled in her memoir, “Times to Remember.” “And, of
course, she realized this too, fully and keenly. Yet she did not give
way.”</p>
<p>She founded the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights
soon after husband’s death and advocated for causes including gun
control and human rights. She rarely spoke about her husband’s
assassination. When her filmmaker daughter, Rory, brought it up in the
2012 HBO documentary, “Ethel,” she couldn’t share her grief.</p>
<p>“When we lost Daddy …” she began, then teared up and asked that her
youngest daughter “talk about something else.”</p>
<p>Presidential Medal of Freedom</p>
<p>In 2008, she joined brother-in-law Ted Kennedy and niece Caroline
Kennedy in endorsing Sen. Barack Obama for president, likening him to
her late husband. She made several trips to the White House during the
Obama years, receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2014 and
meeting Pope Francis in 2015.</p>
<p>Many of her progeny became well known. Daughter Kathleen became
lieutenant governor of Maryland; Joseph represented Massachusetts in
Congress; Courtney married Paul Hill, who had been wrongfully convicted
of an IRA bombing; Kerry became a human rights activist and president of
the RFK center; Christopher ran for governor of Illinois; Max served as
a prosecutor in Philadelphia and Douglas reported for Fox News
Channel.</p>
<p>Her son Robert F. Kennedy Jr., also became a national figure,
although not as a liberal in the family tradition. First known as an
environmental lawyer, he evolved into a conspiracy theorist who spread
false theories about vaccines. He ran for president as an independent
after briefly challenging President Joe Biden, and his name remained on
ballots in multiple states after he suspended his campaign and endorsed
Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Ethel Kennedy did not comment publicly on her son’s actions, although
several other family members denounced him.</p>
<p>Decades earlier, she seemed to thrive on her in-laws’ rising power.
She was an enthusiastic backer of JFK’s 1960 run and during the Kennedy
administration hosted some of the era’s most well-attended parties at
their Hickory Hill estate in McLean, Virginia, including one where
historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. was pushed fully clothed into the
swimming pool. In the Kennedy spirit, she also was known as an avid and
highly competitive tennis player and a compulsive planner.</p>
<p>“Petite and peppy Ethel, who doesn’t look one bit the outdoorsy type,
considers outdoor activity so important for the children that she has
arranged her busy Cabinet-wife schedule so she can personally take them
on two daily outings,” The Washington Post reported in 1962.</p>
<p>In February of that year, she accompanied her husband on a
round-the-world goodwill tour, stopping in Japan, Hong Kong, Italy and
other countries. She said it was important for Americans to meet
ordinary people overseas.</p>
<p>“People have a distinct liking for Americans,” she told the Post.
“But the Communists have been so vocal, it was a surprise for some
Asians to hear America’s point of view. It is good for Americans to
travel and get our viewpoint across.”</p>
<p>Kennedy was born Ethel Skakel on April 11, 1928, in Chicago, the
sixth of seven children of coal magnate George Skakel and Ann Brannack
Skakel, a devout Roman Catholic. She grew up in a 31-room English
country manor house in Greenwich, Connecticut, and attended Greenwich
Academy before graduating from the Convent of the Sacred Heart in the
Bronx in 1945.</p>
<p>She met Robert Kennedy through his sister Jean, her roommate at
Manhattanville College in New York. They moved to Charlottesville,
Virginia, where he finished his last year of law school at the
University of Virginia, and then in 1957, they bought Hickory Hill from
by John and Jacqueline Kennedy, who had bought it in 1953.</p>
<p>Robert Kennedy became chief counsel to the Senate Select Committee in
1957. He later was appointed attorney general by his brother, the newly
elected President Kennedy.</p>
<p>She had supported her husband in his successful 1964 campaign for the
U.S. Senate in New York and his subsequent presidential bid. Pregnant
with their 11th child when he was gunned down by Sirhan Sirhan, her look
of shock and horror was captured by photographers in images that
remained indelible decades later.</p>
<p>The assassination traumatized the family, especially son David
Kennedy, who watched the news in a hotel room. He was just days before
his 13th birthday and never recovered, struggling with addiction
problems for years and overdosing in 1984.</p>
<p>In 2021, she said Sirhan Sirhan should not be released from prison, a
view not shared by some others in her family. Two years later, a
California panel denied him parole.</p>
<p>Although Ethel Kennedy was linked to several men after her husband’s
death, most notably singer Andy Williams, she never remarried.</p>
<p>In April 2008, Ethel Kennedy visited Indianapolis on the 40th
anniversary of the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. A
monument there commemorated King’s death and the speech her husband had
given that night in 1968, which was credited with averting rioting in
the city.</p>
<p>“Of all the Kennedy women, she was the one I would end up admiring
the most,” Harry Belafonte would write of her. “She wasn’t playacting.
She looked at you and immediately got what you were about. Often in the
coming years, when Bobby was balking at something we wanted him to do
for the movement, I’d take my case to Ethel. ‘We have to talk to him,’
she’d say, and she would.”</p>
<p>Ethel Kennedy joined President Obama and former President Bill
Clinton — each held one of her hands — as they climbed stairs to lay a
wreath at President Kennedy’s gravesite during a November 2013
observance of the 50th anniversary of JFK’s death.</p>
<p>The nonprofit center she founded remains dedicated to advancing human
rights through litigation, advocacy, education and inspiration, giving
annual awards to journalists, authors and others who have made
significant contributions to human rights.</p>
<p>She also was active in the Coalition of Gun Control, Special
Olympics, and the Earth Conservation Corps. And she showed up in person,
participating in a 2016 demonstration in support of higher pay for
farmworkers in Florida and a 2018 hunger strike against the Trump
administration’s immigration policies.</p>
<p>Hickory Hill was sold in 2009 for $8.25 million, and Ethel Kennedy
divided her time between homes in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, and Palm
Beach, Florida.</p>

id="us-inflation-reaches-lowest-point-since-february-2021-though-price-pressures-remain">US
inflation reaches lowest point since February 2021, though price
pressures remain</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Inflation in the United States dropped last month to its
lowest point since it first began surging more than three years ago,
adding to a spate of encouraging economic news in the closing weeks of
the presidential race. </p>
<p>Consumer prices rose 2.4% in September from a year earlier, down from
2.5% in August, and the smallest annual rise since February 2021.
Measured from month to month, prices increased 0.2% from August to
September, the Labor Department reported Thursday, the same as in the
previous month. </p>
<p>But excluding volatile food and energy costs, “core” prices, a gauge
of underlying inflation, remained elevated in September, driven higher
by rising costs for medical care, clothing, auto insurance and airline
fares. Core prices in September were up 3.3% from a year earlier and
0.3% from August. Economists closely watch core prices, which typically
provide a better hint of future inflation. </p>
<p>Taken as a whole, the September figures show that inflation is
steadily easing back to the Fed’s 2% target, even if in a gradual and
uneven pattern. Apartment rental costs grew more slowly last month, a
sign that housing inflation is finally cooling, a long-awaited
development that would provide relief to many consumers. </p>
<p>Overall inflation last month was held down by a big drop in gas
prices, which fell 4.1% from August to September. Grocery prices jumped
0.4% last month, after roughly a year of mild increases, though they’re
1.3% higher than a year earlier. </p>
<p>Restaurant food prices increased 0.3% last month and are up 3.9% in
the past year. And clothing prices rose 1.1% from August to September
and are up 1.8% from a year ago. </p>
<p>The improving inflation picture follows a mostly healthy jobs report
released last week, which showed that hiring accelerated in September
and that the unemployment rate dropped from 4.2% to 4.1%. The government
has also reported that the economy expanded at a solid 3% annual rate in
the April-June quarter. Growth likely continued at roughly that pace in
the just-completed July-September quarter. </p>
<p>Cooling inflation, solid hiring and healthy growth could erode former
President Donald Trump’s advantage on the economy in the presidential
campaign as measured by public opinion polls. In some surveys, Vice
President Kamala Harris has pulled even with Trump on the issue of who
would best handle the economy, after Trump had decisively led President
Joe Biden on the issue. </p>
<p>At the same time, most voters still give the economy relatively poor
marks, mostly because of the cumulative rise in prices over the past
three years. </p>
<p>For the Fed, last week’s much-stronger-than-expected jobs report
fueled some concern that the economy might not be cooling enough to slow
inflation sufficiently. The central bank reduced its key rate by an
outsized half-point last month, its first rate cut of any size in four
years. The Fed’s policymakers also signaled that they envisioned two
additional quarter-point rate cuts in November and December. </p>
<p>In remarks this week, a slew of Fed officials have said they’re still
willing to keep cutting their key rate but at a deliberate pace, a
signal that any further half-point cuts are unlikely. </p>
<p>The Fed “should not rush to reduce” its benchmark rate “but rather
should proceed gradually,” Lorie Logan, president of the Federal
Reserve’s Dallas branch, said in a speech Wednesday. </p>
<p>Inflation in the United States and many countries in Europe and Latin
America surged in the economic recovery from the pandemic, as COVID
closed factories and clogged supply chains. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine
worsened energy and food shortages, pushing inflation higher. It peaked
at 9.1% in the U.S. in June 2022. </p>
<p>Economists at Goldman Sachs projected earlier this week that core
inflation will drop to 3% by December 2024. And few analysts expect
inflation to surge again unless conflicts in the Middle East worsen
dramatically. </p>
<p>Though higher prices have soured many Americans on the economy, wages
and incomes are now rising faster than costs and should make it easier
for households to adapt. Last month, the Census Bureau reported that
inflation-adjusted median household incomes — the level at which half of
households are above and half below — rose 4% in 2023, enough to return
incomes back to their pre-pandemic peak. </p>
<p>In response to higher food prices, many consumers have shifted their
spending from name brands to private labels or have started shopping
more at discount stores. Those changes have put more pressure on
packaged foods companies, for example, to slow their price hikes. </p>
<p>This week, PepsiCo reported that its sales volumes fell after it
imposed steep price increases on its drinks and snacks.</p>

Latin America, which is home to some of the most biodiverse regions in
the world, saw the worst losses, at 95%. Freshwater species experienced
the greatest decline at 85%. There are some success stories, such as a
3% increase in the mountain gorilla population, and the incredible
comeback of the European Bison, but generally the report is pretty
heartbreaking. It underscores the interconnected nature of the climate
crisis and nature destruction. “It really does indicate to us that the
fabric of nature is unraveling,”

The head of the International Maritime Organization this week called on

Shipping accounts for about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The
IMO recently set a new industry-wide target of a 20% emissions reduction
by 2030, and net-zero by 2050. But the IMO’s Arsenio Dominguez said
there is more to be done to hit these goals. That includes “low hanging
fruit” like reducing ship speed, charting routes according to the
weather, and cleaning the hulls of ships to reduce friction, <em><em>The

<p>Veronica Johnson, who is leading the training session as the Lee
County director of elections and registration, says hand counting the
ballots is unlikely to pose major operational problems in her small
county.</p>
<p>But logistics are far from election officials’ only concern.</p>
<p>Georgia officials from both sides of the political aisle say the
count is not only superfluous — machines already count the ballots — but
also a potential tool to sow doubt by slowing the process and creating
space for disinformation should discrepancies arise via error-prone
human counting.</p>
<p>“I don’t feel it’s necessary. I have no problem saying that. I think
that at our precincts here in Lee County we’re already balancing our
numbers,” Johnson told AFP.</p>
<p>The change is all the most notable given Republican candidate Trump’s
alleged election tampering in the state in 2020, pushing for Georgia
officials to “find” enough votes to overturn President Joe Biden’s
victory.</p>
<p>‘Misguided’</p>
<p>Lee is among Georgia’s 159 counties, which encompass major
metropolitan areas such as Atlanta and rural regions like the area
surrounding Leesburg, with populations ranging from majority white to
majority Black.</p>
<p>Like many of its rural counterparts, Lee County voted heavily in 2020
for Trump, who received 72 percent of its votes.</p>
<p>Poll workers such as those at the training will be stationed across
the county’s 10 voting precincts on November 5, when U.S. voters choose
between Trump and his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, in
addition to candidates in hundreds of down-ballot races.</p>
<p>Because of lawsuits, Johnson is unsure if hand counting will actually
happen.</p>
<p>“Honestly, every election director I know really just wants to serve
the people and not get bogged down by the political ramifications,” she
said, emphasizing that ballots are already counted by machine three
times.</p>
<p>Calling the rule change “misguided,” Georgia’s Republican Secretary
of State Brad Raffensperger said that “activists seeking to impose
last-minute changes in election procedures” only “undermine voter
confidence and burden election workers,” while Georgia’s Republican
attorney general has stated the new rule is likely illegal.</p>
<p>The Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Party of Georgia
sued to block the rule last week with the Harris campaign’s backing.</p>
<p>‘Untrusting’</p>
<p>The state election board passed the rule by a three-to-two vote —
those in favor being staunch Trump backers praised by the ex-president
as “pit bulls” fighting for “victory.”</p>
<p>Along the same three-to-two lines, the board passed another rule in
August allowing county election boards to conduct a “reasonable inquiry”
before certifying results.</p>
<p>Like the hand count requirement, the measure is being challenged in
court, with critics particularly worried about the vagueness of the word
“reasonable.”</p>
<p>Mitchell Brown, director of the election administration program at
Auburn University in Alabama, told Agence France-Presse that such a rule
is unnecessary given that election officials “have meetings regularly
where they go through the documentation and the information with the
certifying body.”</p>
<p>“The bigger, more interesting question to me is, what happens if a
body chooses not to certify?”</p>
<p>Back in Lee County, Donna Mathis, who has served as a poll worker
since 2018, noted that the “country is divided so much.”</p>
<p>Asked about the hand count and reasonable inquiry rule, she said,
“the hand count doesn’t bother me” given how quickly they were able to
tabulate the votes.</p>
<p>But “I think you can inquire too much, it ties things up,” she added.
“People are just so untrusting anymore that they question
everything.”</p>

<h2
id="though-voter-fraud-rare-us-election-offices-feature-safeguards-to-catch-it">Though
voter fraud rare, US election offices feature safeguards to catch
it</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — You’ve heard the horror stories: Someone casting multiple
ballots, people voting in the name of dead relatives, mail-in ballots
being intercepted. </p>
<p>Voter fraud does happen occasionally. When it does, we tend to hear a
lot about it. It also gets caught and prosecuted. </p>
<p>The nation’s multilayered election processes provide many safeguards
that keep voter fraud generally detectable and rare, according to
current and former election administrators of both parties. </p>
<p>America’s elections are decentralized, with thousands of independent
voting jurisdictions. That makes it virtually impossible to pull off a
large-scale vote-rigging operation that could tip a presidential race —
or almost any other race. </p>
<p>“You’re probably not going to have a perfect election system,” said
Republican Trey Grayson, a former Kentucky secretary of state and the
advisory board chair of the Secure Elections Project. “But if you’re
looking for one that you should have confidence in, you should feel good
about that here in America.” </p>
<p>What’s stopping people from committing voter fraud? </p>
<p>Voting more than once, tampering with ballots, lying about your
residence to vote somewhere else, or casting someone else’s ballot are
crimes that can be punished with hefty fines and prison time. Non-U.S.
citizens who break election laws can be deported. </p>
<p>For anyone still motivated to cheat, election systems in the United
States are designed with multiple layers of protection and transparency
intended to stand in the way. </p>
<p>For in-person voting, most states either require or request voters
provide some sort of ID at the polls. Others require voters to verify
who they are in another way, such as stating their name and address,
signing a poll book or signing an affidavit. </p>
<p>People who try to vote in the name of a recently deceased friend or
family member can be caught when election officials update voter lists
with death records and obituaries, said Gail Pellerin, a Democratic in
the California Assembly who ran elections in Santa Cruz County for more
than 27 years. </p>
<p>Those who try to impersonate someone else run the risk that someone
at the polls knows that person or that the person will later try to cast
their own ballot, she said. </p>
<p>What protections exist for absentee voting? </p>
<p>For absentee voting, different states have different ballot
verification protocols. All states require a voter’s signature. Many
states have further precautions, such as having bipartisan teams compare
the signature with other signatures on file, requiring the signature to
be notarized or requiring a witness to sign. </p>
<p>That means even if a ballot is erroneously sent to someone’s past
address and the current resident mails it in, there are checks to alert
election workers to the foul play. </p>
<p>A growing number of states offer online or text-based ballot tracking
tools as an extra layer of protection, allowing voters to see when their
ballot has been sent out, returned and counted. </p>
<p>Federal law requires voter list maintenance, and election officials
do that through a variety of methods, from checking state and federal
databases to collaborating with other states to track voters who have
moved. </p>
<p>Ballot drop boxes have security protocols, too, said Tammy Patrick,
chief executive officer for programs at the National Association of
Election Officials. </p>
<p>She explained the boxes are often designed to stop hands from
stealing ballots and are surveilled by camera, bolted to the ground and
constructed with fire-retardant chambers, so if someone threw in a lit
match, it wouldn’t destroy the ballots inside. </p>
<p>Sometimes, alleged voter fraud isn’t what it seems </p>
<p>After the 2020 election, social media surged with claims of dead
people casting ballots, double voting or destroyed piles of ballots on
the side of the road. </p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump promoted and has continued to amplify
these claims. But the vast majority of them were found to be
untrue. </p>
<p>An Associated Press investigation that explored every potential case
of voter fraud in the six battleground states disputed by Trump found
there were fewer than 475 out of millions of votes cast. That was not
nearly enough to tip the outcome. Democrat Joe Biden won the six states
by a combined 311,257 votes. </p>
<p>The review also showed no collusion intended to rig the voting.
Virtually every case was based on an individual acting alone to cast
additional ballots. In one case, a man mistakenly thought he could vote
while on parole. In another, a woman was suspected of sending in a
ballot for her dead mother. </p>
<p>Former election officials say that even more often, allegations of
voter fraud turn out to result from a clerical error or a
misunderstanding. </p>
<p>Pellerin said she remembered when a political candidate in her county
raised suspicion about many people being registered to vote at the same
address. It turned out the voters were nuns who all lived in the same
home. </p>
<p>Patrick said that when she worked in elections in Maricopa County,
Arizona, mismatched signatures were sometimes explained by a broken arm
or a recent stroke. In other cases, an elderly person tried to vote
twice because they forgot they had already submitted a mail ballot. </p>
<p>“You really have to think about the intent of the voter,” Patrick
said. “It isn’t always intuitive.” </p>
<p>Why voter fraud is unlikely to affect the presidential race </p>
<p>It would be wrong to suggest that voter fraud never happens. </p>
<p>With millions of votes cast in an election year, it’s almost
guaranteed there will be a few cases of someone trying to game the
system. There also have been more insidious efforts, such as a
vote-buying scheme in 2006 in Kentucky. </p>
<p>In that case, Grayson said, voters complained, and an investigation
ensued. Then participants admitted what they had done. </p>
<p>He said the example shows how important it is for election officials
to stay vigilant and constantly improve security in order to help voters
feel confident. </p>
<p>But, he said, it would be hard to make any such scheme work on a
larger scale. Fraudsters would have to navigate onerous nuances in each
county’s election system. They also would have to keep a large number of
people quiet about a crime that could be caught at any moment by
officials or observers. </p>
<p>“This decentralized nature of the elections is itself a deterrent,”
Grayson said.</p>

a Fight over Cables Could Kill Offshore Wind in New Jersey</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzgwMDA2Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MDY0NzEwNn0.Efdy9fizQg1lk5y2dKa_fBs4bfZQASn9LqsyUIisWiA/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
One of the biggest threats to American offshore wind is a handful of
homeowners on the south Jersey shoreline spouting unproven theories
about magnetic fields.
</p>
<p>
Within a year of forming, the activist group “Stop The High-Risk Cables”
has galvanized local politicians against the transmission infrastructure
being planned for wind turbines off the coast of New Jersey known as the
<a href="https://bpuoffshorewind.nj.gov/prebuild-solicitation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Larrabee
Pre-built Infrastructure</u></a>. The transmission route, which will run
a few miles from the beaches of Sea Girt, New Jersey, to a substation
nearby, is expected to be a crucial landing zone for power from major
offshore wind projects in south Jersey waters, including Atlantic
Shores, a joint venture between EDF Renewables and Shell that received
final permits from federal regulators last week.
</p>
<p>
The only problem: while state regulators have been busy planning the
route for the transmission and selecting who will build it, opponents
have managed to win the war of public opinion. Activists have clearly
turned their neighbors against the plan, pushing the mayors of the four
boroughs targeted for Pre-Built Infrastructure to come out against the
project. And this weekend Jack Ciattarelli – who narrowly lost the race
for the governor’s mansion last year and is running again in 2025 –
joined activists rallying against the project and is
<a href="https://x.com/Jack4NJ/status/1842963189891563676" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>now
campaigning</u></a> on ending the project and cable landings like it.
</p>
<p>
Since federal regulators control the waters, what this means is, unless
Democrats hit the electoral jackpot over the next year, offshore wind in
New Jersey could be screwed – even if Kamala Harris wins the White
House.
</p>
<p>
What makes this more dire is, this isn’t any ol’ transmission. For other
offshore wind projects like Empire Wind, states have forced developers
to design and construct their own transmission landings, creating a
somewhat disorganized situation resembling electrical spaghetti. New
Jersey’s offshore wind transmission meanwhile has been studied for years
and is supposed to minimize development on the shoreline. This means the
combat over this cabling could decide the fates of multiple offshore
wind projects – and the first major proactive plan to reduce beach-level
environmental impacts that stymie offshore wind in the first place.
</p>
<p>
So I decided to dive deep into the campaign against the so-called
“high-risk” cables. After a series of interviews with organizers and a
mayor critical of the state’s processes, I’ve been left feeling this
relatively small transmission project represents a true test for
democracy’s role in climate action. Could a small band of organized
individuals be
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/wind-farm-protests-leah-stokes-pnas" target="_self"><u>all
it takes</u></a> to hold back decarbonization at the pace scientists say
is necessary, no matter how many climate laws are passed?
</p>
<h3>
The Magnetic Fields
</h3>
<p>
Sea Girt resident Kimberly Paterson remembers when she first heard about
the cables. Someone had left a postcard on her door about the project.
Before that, the professional executive leadership trainer had devoted
her activism to preserving maritime forests on the beach. Once made
aware of the transmission cables though, she and her small coterie of
environmentally-conscious neighbors got active.
</p>
<p>
Paterson said they also started getting looped in with an existing
network of activists concerned about offshore wind infrastructure. Those
activists included familiar characters to the fight over New Jersey
offshore wind development.
</p>
<p>
People like Mike Dean of Save the East Coast and Cindy Zipf of Clean
Ocean Action, who’ve spread theories without evidence about a spate of
whale deaths being tied to pile drivers for offshore wind. She says her
group’s work is focused on the cables, not offshore wind, despite the
close allyship with these other actors. As she simply put it, “There’s a
circle of people that you meet.”
</p>
<p>
“We do like to work with others, and communicate with others, but we’re
not officially tied to any of those other groups.”
</p>
<p>
The group also started canvassing, making signage for homeowners, and
holding public events. As calls for action grew, so too did the
political focus on the area, as state legislators and members of
Congress took up the issue.
</p>
<p>
“We have created an absolute firestorm here,” Paterson told me. ’It is
unbelievable what we’ve accomplished.”
</p>
<p>
The group is focused on what they believe to be the health risks of
simply being near high-voltage power lines.
</p>
<p>
To understand their fears, think of an electric current going through a
wire. The more current goes through a wire, the higher likelihood of
electrical waves emanating from the current’s pathway. That’s where
“electro-magnetic fields” come into play. These fields are all around us
and even Earth emits them. It’s the result of an excess of energy.
<br/><br/>The World Health Organization
<a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/electromagnetic-fields" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>classifies
even</u></a> low amounts of electromagnetic fields as a possible
carcinogen, citing studies around exposure and childhood leukemia rates.
But as many environmental and health
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/radtown/electric-and-magnetic-fields-power-lines" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>experts
note</u></a>, studies to date have not really linked cancer occurrences
to prolonged exposure to these fields. The Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management
<a href="https://www.boem.gov/sites/default/files/documents/renewable-energy/state-activities/BOEM-Electromagnetic-Fields-Offshore-Wind-Facilities_1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>says
the</u></a> electro-magnetic fields created by cables for offshore wind
“are well below the
</p>
<p>
recommended threshold values for human exposure.” So like whales and
wind, it’s something to watch out for, but there’s no evidence to date
of a danger here. <br/><br/>
</p>
<p>
Nonetheless, seeking to calm any resident’s fears of magnetic fields,
the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities last week convened their first
public hearing within the planned development area.
</p>
<p>
At the event, numerous officials came and spoke to the project’s safety,
including the executive director of the Board. They even played a long
explanatory video from a consultant they hired to review the
electro-magnetic fields that would come from the cables. The full
presentation laid out numerous examples of what they said were similar
underground and underwater transmission lines with magnetic emissions
that had no discernable impact on public health, including lines in the
New Jersey-New York region.
</p>
<p>
One person moved by the presentation’s efforts on magnetic fields was
Mike Mangan, mayor of Manasquan, one of the boroughs that may be
selected to host some of the transmission infrastructure. Mangan told me
he joined with other mayors to press the state for more transparency on
the cables at the behest of concerned constituents. But he didn’t know
what the state knew about the magnetic fields.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll just be candid — I was ignorant on a lot of that,” he
acknowledged. Mangan said he still has “a few very serious concerns” but
“I think they addressed some of the bigger concerns,” including the
magnetic fields.
</p>
<p>
I’ll admit, I felt the same. So far in The Fight, we’ve chronicled
examples where there are at least somewhat reasonable concerns about
renewable energy development – stuff like batteries
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/hecate-energy-acton-mike-garcia" target="_self"><u>sited
in wildfire risk areas</u></a> and solar farms
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/center-biological-diversity-tortoise-solar" target="_self"><u>in
imperiled tortoise habitat</u></a>. But in this case, I watched the
entire presentation online and left thinking this was essentially a
non-issue.
</p>
<p>
Yet Paterson says she was unconvinced by the presentation. The projects
they’re citing aren’t comparable, she claims. And then she has a laundry
list of other complaints about the potential cables.
</p>
<p>
Hearing her talk about the transmission, you’d think she just doesn’t
want this built under any circumstances. So I asked her if, given her
allies, the goal is to stop offshore wind. An avid wildlife painter, she
says no, and that she’s “very strongly in support of alternative
energy.”
</p>
<p>
Well, okay. Maybe it’s political or partisan then? I asked her who she’s
voting for in this year’s presidential election. “I don’t like anyone in
the election to be quite honest,” she confessed, self-identifying simply
as a “libertarian.” She then added: “I love the idea of Robert F.
Kennedy [Jr.] revolutionizing our health-care system. That makes me very
excited.”
</p>
<h2>
Tug of war over power lines
</h2>
<p>
Last week, Heatmap published a risk index of the top 10 renewable energy
projects worth watching for potential cancellation or major blowback to
the energy transition.
</p>
<p>
We listed Atlantic Shores in the top five, primarily citing the
project’s current role as a focal point for opponents to offshore wind
up and down the Atlantic coastline. Hours after the risk index was
published, Atlantic Shores received its final approval from the Bureau
of Ocean Energy Management.
</p>
<p>
Despite that win, we’re leaving the project on the index because the
cables have to be built too – and that stands to be a more stressful
fight.
</p>
<p>
It wasn’t supposed to be hard. In 2021, New Jersey passed a law granting
the Board of Public Utilities the authority to supersede local
governments opposing easements and other permits for offshore wind
transmission cables. But that law’s permissibility under the state
constitution hasn’t been tested yet, thanks to the cancellation of
Orsted’s Ocean Wind project, which was set to be the
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-jersey-state-government-phil-murphy-climate-and-environment-utilities-b23542107c4369a1b842dae985e0e7a0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>likeliest
battleground over cables</u></a> before Atlantic Shores.
</p>
<p>
State officials are expected in the coming weeks to lay out who will
actually build the transmission infrastructure and the route it’ll take
from Sea Girt to the Larrabee substation. Between the day of that
announcement and the completion of construction, a lot can go awry.
Donald Trump could win the presidency and, as opponents of offshore wind
expect, revisit permitting decisions for projects like Atlantic Shores.
Or a Republican like Jack Ciattarelli could win the governor’s mansion,
and that person could take any number of steps to undermine the cables
like leaving the local control law undefended in state court if it’s
challenged.
</p>
<p>
All this risk to the energy transition, started by a handful of actors
with unfounded claims about magnetic fields.
</p>
<p>
I asked Atlantic Shores for comment on the opposition movement. They did
not get back to me.
</p>
<p>
However, I did hear from the New Jersey Offshore Wind Alliance, a
consortium of developers trying to build offshore wind off the state
coast. “While we are advocates of civil discourse and engagement from
communities, we urge residents to be mindful of prevalent
misinformation,” said Paulina O’Connor, executive director of the
alliance, in a statement sent to me Tuesday evening.
</p>
<p>
“By following best practices in environmental science and engineering,
such as proper siting, minimizing disruption during construction, and
adherence to all state and federal regulations, this infrastructure can
be safely and responsibly integrated into our communities and local and
regional power grids to provide resilient and reliable power to New
Jersey homes,” O’Connor continued.
</p>
<p>
I also heard from Anjuli Ramos-Busot, executive director of Sierra
Club’s New Jersey chapter, who contacted me last night after Atlantic
Shores and the offshore wind alliance brought my reporting to their
attention.
</p>
<p>
“Let us be clear, the microwave in your kitchen emits more
electromagnetic currents than cables buried deep underground covered by
insulation and concrete,” Ramos-Busot said in a statement. “This
technology is vetted, goes through rigorous permitting standards, and is
safe and responsible for both the environment and local communities.”
</p>
<p>
Candidly, I’m holding my breath on whether Sierra Club’s words will win
over these concerned shore residents.

Hurricanes Have Birthed a New Kind of Climate Denial</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzgwMDE0Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MTI3MDY1NX0.bHYFF2prszzAlekS9mswZwcYc4MpdIuSNJTpgrkSDWk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Maybe Sharpiegate wasn’t so funny after all.
</p>
<p>
You’ll recall the micro-controversy from 2019, when then-President
Donald Trump said that Hurricane Dorian was headed toward Alabama (which
it wasn’t), and officials from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration were
<a href="https://time.com/5775953/trump-dorian-alabama-sharpiegate-noaa/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pressured</u></a>
to back up Trump’s mistake. It culminated in Trump presenting a map in
the Oval Office on which someone drew a bubble atop the projected path
of the storm so it would stretch into Alabama, apparently with a
Sharpie.
</p>
<p>
At the time it was troubling but comical, a representation of how the
cult-like adoration Trump demanded would distort the work of government
in idiotic ways. Five years later, with a storm surge of misinformation
pouring over the country in response to Hurricanes Helene and Milton, it
looks more like a harbinger of things to come.
</p>
<p>
In any crisis, some measure of confusion is inevitable. Rumors spread
and misunderstandings proliferate, fed by fear and desperation. The most
extravagant varieties of misinformation are often either short-lived or
confined to a minority of the population. That has not been true,
however, when it comes to Helene, and it
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-milton-misinformation" target="_self"><u>looks
like</u></a> Milton will repeat the same pattern. This time, the
misinformation is more explicitly partisan than ever before, and it
portends a disturbing future in which every natural disaster could
become not just a challenging task of rescue and cleanup but a
simultaneous fight against falsehoods and conspiracy theories.
</p>
<p>
It’s not that disasters have never been political; presidents are often
judged by how they react (anyone over 40 knows what the phrase
“<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/hurricane-katrina-anniversary/heck-job-brownie-where-disgraced-fema-head-now-n400436" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Brownie,
you’re doing a heckuva job</u></a>” refers to), with politicians
discredited or elevated by how they performed and the opposition taking
the opportunity to criticize the administration’s competence. But Trump
has given that familiar criticism a particularly venomous cast, claiming
not just that the disaster response is falling short but that President
Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are
<em><em>intentionally</em></em> ignoring the victims because of who they
are.
</p>
<p>
Trump has focused in particular on
<a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/376982/trump-hurricane-helene-fema-lies-debunked" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>three
falsehoods</u></a>: First, that the federal government is abandoning
hurricane victims in areas where there are lots of Republican voters;
<a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2024/10/trumps-false-claim-of-stolen-disaster-relief-funds/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>second</u></a>,
that funds for recovery are unavailable because the Biden administration
gave them to undocumented immigrants (“they stole the FEMA money, just
like they stole it from a bank, so they could give it to their illegal
immigrants that they want to have vote for them this season”); and
third, that the $750 distributed immediately to survivors to enable them
to obtain food and other basics, known as Serious Needs Assistance, is
all the aid anyone will get.
</p>
<p>
It was like a bat-signal: As soon as Trump set the terms, conservative
media and influencers
<a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/right-wing-media-are-falsely-claiming-fema-spent-their-resources-migrants-instead-helping" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>swung
into action</u></a>, repeating Trump’s bogus
<a href="https://slate.com/technology/2024/10/charlie-kirk-elon-musk-hurricane-helene-fema-misinformation-x-twitter.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>claims</u></a>
to their audiences. And then things took a strange turn.
</p>
<p>
To bring a conspiracy theory into the mainstream, you need individuals
and outlets who serve as disinformation linkages, connecting the crazier
people and ideas to those with legitimacy. In this case, Representative
Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, played a key role, and
she had a message: The weather is being manipulated by a shadowy
conspiracy with powerful technologies at its disposal. “Yes they can
control the weather,” she
<a href="https://x.com/RepMTG/status/1842755981312196688" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>posted
on X</u></a> to her 3.7 million followers. “Anyone who says they don’t,
or makes fun of this, is lying to you.”
</p>
<p>
As evidence, Greene and her allies offer the fact that many people have
<em><em>proposed</em></em> geoengineering as a solution to a warming
planet, which in their eyes means it must already be taking place, and
that’s why these hurricanes came to the Southeast. And who is “They”? It
might be the government, but to many, it’s obviously the Jews.
</p>
<p>
Antisemitic conspiracy theories around the hurricanes are swirling on
the fetid sewer of right-wing hate and misinformation controlled by the
world’s richest individual. As the <em><em>Washington Post</em></em>
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/10/08/hurricane-helene-antisemitic-misinformation-x/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a>,
“The attacks, which include wild claims that Jewish officials are
conspiring to orchestrate the disasters, sabotage the recovery or even
seize victims’ property, are being fomented largely on Elon Musk’s X.”
</p>
<p>
The tide of misinformation can be partly explained by the calendar.
“What’s different about this natural disaster is the timing,” says
Danielle Lee Tomson of the Center for an Informed Public at the
University of Washington. “We’ve never had such an incredible,
devastating natural disaster within weeks of a presidential election
that has impacted two swing states,” North Carolina and Georgia. That
gives purchase to the claims that there are conspiracies afoot to change
the outcome of the election.
</p>
<p>
In 2024, it may have been inevitable that a disaster would be tied,
however implausibly, to the “one narrative to rule them all this
election cycle, which is that of non-citizen voting,” Tomson notes.
</p>
<p>
Disaster makes people search for answers that give order to chaos and
suffering. Even answers that describe a world of sinister forces can be
weirdly comforting, by assuring their adherents that they are among a
select group who understand the reality most people miss. Amidst the
chaos, you can grasp onto whatever bizarre belief you choose.
</p>
<p>
In the future, we might expect that any climate-linked disaster —
hurricanes, floods, heat waves, droughts — will become fodder for this
kind of misinformation, not just passed around from person to person but
driven from the top of the political food chain.
</p>
<p>
In effect, this is the inverse of the kind of climate misinformation
we’re more used to, which goes under the heading of “denial”: denying
that temperatures are increasing, or that carbon pollution is a problem,
or that human activity drives climate change. Since the occurrence of a
hurricane or fire or other observably extreme event can’t be denied,
this new kind of misinformation actually posits not just that the
effects of climate change are real, but that they’re
<em><em>worse</em></em> than you realize. It isn’t just that people have
lost their lives or their homes due to a disaster, but that the disaster
was engineered by sinister forces (including but not limited to the
government) to accomplish a nefarious political goal.
</p>
<p>
So yesterday’s climate denier could become tomorrow’s climate obsessive,
seeing in every disaster the hidden hand of the same global conspiracy
that is creating all the world’s problems. “Climate change is the new
covid,”
<a href="https://x.com/RepMTG/status/1843432743163834722" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a>
Congresswoman Greene; “Ask your government if the weather is manipulated
or controlled.” It’s not fake, it’s a plot, one getting worse with each
upward tick in global temperatures.
</p>
<p>
Of course, misinformation comes in a variety of forms — some
<a href="https://x.com/florida_grand/status/1843641980523557185?s=46" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>downplayed</u></a>
Milton as a way of arguing that the elites are trying to frighten you —
and even debunkings can be a path to elevated social media clout when so
much focus is on these events.
</p>
<p>
It may be, as Tomson argues, that it takes something like an impending
election to turn conspiracy theorizing around disasters up to 11. “We’ve
never seen such an opportune moment to repackage disaster for political
gain,” she told me. But the effects of climate change will only grow
more intense and dramatic, and there will be political actors looking to
turn them against their opponents — and frightened people ready to
believe the worst.

<strong>1. Nantucket County, Massachusetts</strong> – A new group –
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/keepnantucketwild/" target="_blank"><u>Keep
Nantucket Wild</u></a> – is mobilizing opposition to the Vineyard Wind
offshore wind project, seeking to capitalize on the recent blade
breakage to sever the town of Nantucket’s good neighbor agreement with
project developer Avangrid.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Keep Nantucket Wild was started weeks ago by raw bar restaurateur Jesse
Sandole and yoga studio owner Evie O’Connor. The group already has
amassed

company payment into a community fund and promises to reduce nighttime
visual impacts.

<p>
<strong>2. East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana</strong> – One lowkey
local election this fall may decide the future of Louisiana’s
renewables: the swing seat on the state’s Public Service Commission,
which is being vacated this year by a retiring moderate Republican.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Only 3% of Louisiana’s power generation came
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=LA#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20coal%20fueled%20about,of%20Louisiana's%20total%20electricity%20generation." target="_blank"><u>from
renewables</u></a> last year but that’s poised for significant growth
thanks to offshore wind development
<a href="https://www.boem.gov/renewable-energy/state-activities/gulf-mexico-activities" target="_blank"><u>in
the Gulf</u></a> and the PSC’s decision over the summer to let Entergy
expand its solar capacity in the state
<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/entergy-louisiana-psc-solar-procurement/716944/" target="_blank"><u>by
3 GW</u></a>.<br/>
</li>
<li>
State Sen. J.P. Coussan is one of the leading candidates for the opening
on the PSC. A Republican, he said at an
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO7Y_6rBiQI" target="_blank"><u>event
last month</u></a> that he’s open to more solar but is worried about
“losing the farmland” that could be used by the sugar business. He also
believes renewables will ultimately make up “lower than overall 10% of
the power matrix.”<br/>
</li>
<li>
There are two other candidates for the open seat: Republican former
state Sen. Julie Quinn, who is a dyed-in-the-wool conservative and
opposes renewables, and Democrat Nick Laborde, who deeply supports
renewables but has never served in public office and currently works in
human resources.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>3. Logan County, Ohio </strong>– Invenergy’s Fountain Point
solar project cleared a hurdle with the Ohio Power Siting Board last
month. But the 280 megawatt proposal may face a lengthy appeals process,
according to Mike Yoder, a county commissioner who had recently served
as an ad hoc member of the OPSB.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Yoder, whose county is where the project is proposed, told
<a href="https://www.peakofohio.com/local-news/listen-up-commissioner-mike-yoder" target="_blank"><u>local
radio</u></a> on Monday that the project is not affected by a recent law
empowering counties against solar and wind as challenges to the project
began before the law was passed.<br/>
</li>
<li>
But discussing potential challenges to the state Supreme Court, Yoder
said he expects construction is still “well down the road.”
</li>
<li>
“I know that we got some emails from folks who were concerned we would
be voting on it and moving forward and everything happened in two or
three days and that’s not really the way it’s going to be,” he said.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>4. Riverside County, California </strong>– The federal
government is now taking
<a href="https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/2030262/510" target="_blank">public
comment</a> on a 100+ megawatt solar farm proposed in the California
desert in an area demarcated as a priority for energy development.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The Sapphire Solar project, which was proposed by EDF Renewables, has
also been

<strong>Transmissions on transmission </strong>– The Energy Department
last week
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/gdo/national-transmission-planning-study" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released
a must-read</a> national planning study for transmission to connect
renewables to the grid through 2040.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The takeaway? We could reduce billions of tonnes of CO2 emissions with
interregional transmission and constraining development would require
new nuclear and hydrogen energy to meet emission reduction targets,
instead of solar, wind, and batteries.<br/>
</li>
<li>
The lengthy report didn’t go into the permitting challenges at all
though and the mapping does read aspirational if you know the context.
</li>
<li>
Regardless, we hope to see you on DOE’s webinar on the study
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/gdo/events/october-16-national-transmission-planning-study-informational-webinar" target="_blank"><u>next

</ul>
<p>
<strong>SCOTUS shrugs for once</strong> – The Supreme Court
<a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2024/10/supreme-court-declines-to-block-epa-methane-mercury-rules/" target="_blank">declined
to stay</a> challenges to the EPA’s methane and mercury air pollution
regulations, meaning at least two Biden regulatory tailwinds for
renewables developers remains in play.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
This means those challenges will have to weave their way through the
appeals process while remaining in effect for companies.<br/>
</li>
<li>
There’s still an outstanding request for the high court to stay EPA’s
CO2 regulations for power plants though, so stay tuned.
</li>
<li>
Meanwhile, the court has asked the U.S. solicitor general to weigh in on

<strong>Are fossil fuel projects more or less insurable than the
renewable projects you cover? </strong>
</p>
<p>
On the whole, renewables are more exposed to natural catastrophe risk.
You’re putting glass out onto a field that has hail or fire or what have
you, and you see more exposure to natural events than you would [even] a
spinning turbine that’s surrounded by steel. When we were getting to
insuring property, the first risk that came onto our radar screen was
hail risk. The industry had shifted development into Texas for a variety
of reasons and the insurance companies at that point in time were not
recalibrating their models for the fact there’s actually quite
significant hail in Texas. And we were seeing significant losses.
</p>
<p>
It’s not uncommon to have multiple $50 million loss events in any given
year for solar projects due to hail, typically in Texas, Oklahoma.
That’s the zone of hail. And we don’t see that with a gas facility
particularly because, well, it’s in a building.
</p>
<p>
But it’s way more distributed than a single fossil fuel facility, so
even if you have a $50 million loss, that does not have an impact on the
ability of the grid to generate.
</p>
<p>
The part of the facility that is not damaged will continue to produce
power and put power onto the grid. You get many more partial loss events
versus a gas facility where the turbine goes and you basically have a
total loss. Your ability to distribute your risk is much greater with
renewables, which is a very strong pro from an insurance underwriting
perspective.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Are new technologies helping with renewables’ insurability?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
In the last few years, there’s been a lot of innovation. At RE+ you walk
among the floor of battery providers and they all have very impressive
fire management capabilities, and it’s at the forefront of how they
market their technology. You also see that with solar modules some have
said, <em><em>we’re hail resistant</em></em>. The way they’re putting
sensors onto cells, the way they’re running controls on cooling devices,
the way thermal management systems and battery management systems have
abilities to vent for heat… they’ve made a lot of improvements.
</p>
<p>
But it’s interesting – I was at an asset management conference in March
and I’d been going to that conference for 10 years, and it was the first
time I’d heard at that conference about the social license to operate.
They’re seeing these quasi-local thought leader groups that all seem to
be using the same talking points that oppose large scale solar in their
communities, and they push local regulatory rules to reduce the ability
to develop solar in their backyards. It was encouraging to see a
discussion around it and an acknowledgement that as an industry we need
to go into these communities and spend time talking to the local
communities.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Fascinating. Do you think discussions like these are enough to
mean progress in dealing with project opposition? </strong>
</p>
<p>
It’s not historically been in the DNA of our industry to do that. I’d
say today the opposition is much more organized than many renewable
energy developers today so it’s been this interesting phenomenon. The
local opposition says <em><em>we don’t want this industrial
solar</em></em>. It’s proven to be effective at killing some of these
utility scale deals.
</p>
<p>
We still have a long way to go in educating communities and getting them
comfortable with the land stewardship that happens at these facilities.
The solar industry manages a ton of land. It’s not my core focus but
I’ve been exposed to those challenges around the community engagement
piece and I think most developers are still building the muscle in how
to do that effectively.

<h2 id="kde-plasma-6.2-released">KDE Plasma 6.2 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Entirely coincidentally, the KDE team released Plasma 6.2 yesterday,
the latest release in the well-received 6.x series. As the version
number implies, it’s not a groundbreaking release, but it does contain a
number of improvements that are very welcome to a few specific, often
underserved groups. For instance, 6.2 overhauls the Accessibility
settings panel, and ads, among other things, colourblindness filters for
a variety of types of colourblindness. This condition affects roughly
8-9% of the population, so it’s an important new feature. Another group
of people served by Plasma 6.2 are artists. Plasma 6.2 includes a
smorgasbord of new features for users of drawing tablets. Open System
Settings and look for Drawing Tablet to see various tools for
configuring drawing tablets. New in Plasma 6.2: a tablet calibration
wizard and test mode; a feature to define the area of the screen that
your tablet covers (the whole screen or a section); and the option to
re-bind pen buttons to different kinds of mouse clicks. ↫ KDE Plasma 6.2
release announcement Artists and regular users alike can now also enjoy
better colour management, more complete HDR support, a tone-mapping
feature in Kwin, and much more. Power management has been improved as
well, so you can now manage brightness per individual monitor, control
which application block going to sleep, and so on. There’s also the
usual array of bug fixes, UI tweaks, and so on. Plasma 6.2 is already
available in at least Fedora and openSUSE, and it will find its way to
your distribution soon enough, too.</p>

<h2 id="zavala-3.0">Zavala 3.0</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: Maurice Parker</p>
<h2 id="it-s-live">
It’s Live!
</h2>
<p>
Zavala 3.0 is now live in the App Stores. There are only a couple of new
major features in Zavala 3.0, but I put a lot of under the hood for this
release. Lots of code was changed to modernize the code base and support
new operating system features. For example, Zavala will support the
Apple Intelligence Writing Tools when they become available in macOS
15.1 and iOS/iPadOS 18.1 (assuming you have a supported device).
</p>
<p>
The biggest change was adopting Swift Structured Concurrency. This
should not be noticeable to the average user except that there should be
fewer unexplained crashes happening now. The crashes themselves are
rare, but I want using Zavala to be as good as it can be.
</p>
<p>
The new Group and Sort commands are nice to have, new features. As usual
there were a handful of bug fixes too.
</p>
<h2 id="what-s-next">
What’s next?
</h2>
<p>
I’m honestly not sure what I should, if anything enhance next. I started
out to build a good, simple outliner and I think that is what Zavala is
now. One of the reasons that I wanted Zavala to be free and open source
is so that I didn’t have to have a constant upgrade cycle to drive
revenue. Basically, I didn’t want to add features I didn’t believe in
just to make a living. That could lead to Zavala suffering from feature
bloat. I’ve seen enough applications fall into that trap.
</p>
<p>
This doesn’t mean that Zavala is abandoned or not being maintained. I
still plan on fixing bugs and taking feature requests seriously. Stuff
that fits well in Zavala and doesn’t over complicate it will be added in
minor releases, the same way that it was in the 2.x series. Apple
evolves their platforms at an astonishing rate and developers have to
modify their apps to keep up with it. I’ll stay on top of things, like
Apple Intelligence, so that Zavala doesn’t get left behind and look or
feel dated.
</p>
<p>
As always, if you find a bug or have an enhancement request, drop me an
email. Heck, email me just to say, Hi. Since I don’t collect any user
data, this is the only way I know that anyone is even using Zavala.

<p>LAS VEGAS — Sin City blew a kiss goodbye to the Tropicana before
first light Wednesday in an elaborate implosion that reduced to rubble
the last true mob building on the Las Vegas Strip. </p>
<p>The Tropicana’s hotel towers tumbled in a celebration that included a
fireworks display. It was the first implosion in nearly a decade for a
city that loves fresh starts and that has made casino implosions as much
a part of its identity as gambling itself. </p>
<p>“What Las Vegas has done, in classic Las Vegas style, they’ve turned
many of these implosions into spectacles,” said Geoff Schumacher,
historian and vice president of exhibits and programs at the Mob
Museum. </p>

casinos in 1993 with the implosion of the Dunes to make room for the
Bellagio. Wynn thought not only to televise the event but created a
fantastical story for the implosion that made it look like pirate ships
at his other casino across the street were firing at the Dunes. </p>
<p>From then on, Schumacher said, there was a sense in Las Vegas that
destruction at that magnitude was worth witnessing. </p>
<p>The city hasn’t blown up a Strip casino since 2016, when the final
tower of the Riviera was leveled for a convention center expansion. </p>
<p>This time, the implosion cleared land for a $1.5 billion baseball
stadium for the relocating Oakland Athletics, part of the city’s latest
rebrand into a sports hub. </p>
<p>That will leave only the Flamingo from the city’s mob era on the
Strip. But, Schumacher said, the Flamingo’s original structures are long
gone. The casino was completely rebuilt in the 1990s. </p>
<p>The Tropicana, the third-oldest casino on the Strip, closed in April
after welcoming guests for 67 years. </p>
<p>Once known as the “Tiffany of the Strip” for its opulence, it was a
frequent haunt of the legendary Rat Pack, while its past under the mob
has long cemented its place in Las Vegas lore. </p>
<p>It opened in 1957 with three stories and 300 hotel rooms split into
two wings. </p>
<p>As Las Vegas rapidly evolved in the following decades, including a
building boom of Strip megaresorts in the 1990s, the Tropicana also
underwent major changes. Two hotel towers were added in later years. In
1979, the casino’s beloved $1 million green-and-amber stained glass
ceiling was installed above the casino floor. </p>
<p>The Tropicana’s original low-rise hotel wings survived the many
renovations, however, making it the last true mob structure on the
Strip. </p>
<p>Behind the scenes of the casino’s grand opening, the Tropicana had
ties to organized crime, largely through reputed mobster Frank
Costello. </p>
<p>Costello was shot in the head in New York weeks after the Tropicana’s
debut. He survived, but the investigation led police to a piece of paper
in his coat pocket with the Tropicana’s exact earnings figure, revealing
the mob’s stake in the casino. </p>
<p>By the 1970s, federal authorities investigating mobsters in Kansas
City charged more than a dozen operatives with conspiring to skim $2
million in gambling revenue from Las Vegas casinos, including the
Tropicana. Charges connected to the Tropicana alone resulted in five
convictions. </p>
<p>There were no public viewing areas for the event, but fans of the
Tropicana did have a chance in April to bid farewell to the vintage
Vegas relic. </p>
<p>“Old Vegas, it’s going,” Joe Zappulla, a teary-eyed New Jersey
resident, said at the time as he exited the casino, shortly before the
locks went on the doors.</p>

<h2 id="hurricane-milton-crashes-into-tampas-development-boom">Hurricane
Milton Crashes Into Tampa’s Development Boom</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mzc4OTE2MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MzE3ODI3M30.tBwN1xScpd7-hItaMUgyw7Hnx3lhI0a5ytKWh8R6KvU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
In around 12 hours, Hurricane Milton is set to make landfall within
miles of Tampa Bay, a region that is home to
<a href="https://stateoftheregion.com/our-region/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
than 5 million</u></a> people. Once a sleepy retirement community, the
area has seen a major development boom in recent years fueled by
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tampa-why-gen-z-and-millennial-tourists-are-flocking-to-this-retirement-mecca-1e2be027" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Millennials
and Gen Zers</u></a> seeking the perks of coastal living; it was
<a href="https://www.axios.com/local/tampa-bay/2024/05/28/fastest-growing-cities-florida-america" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
11th fastest-growing city</u></a> of its size in the U.S. as of this
spring and has been expected to continue to grow at nearly twice the
rate of the rest of the country over the next five years. A
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/climate-environment/tampa-florida-hurricane-milton-vulnerabilities-2febd205" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>third</u></a>
of those residents, including many of the newcomers, live in low-lying
neighborhoods now under urgent evacuation notices due to the threat of
“unsurvivable” storm surge, which could rise up to 15 feet.
</p>
<p>
The development boom that has made Tampa Bay so desirable is also why
it’s particularly vulnerable. In an analysis of Hurricane Ian — the most
expensive storm in Florida’s history, which struck just south of
Milton’s projected track in 2022 — the re-insurance company Swiss Re
<a href="https://www.tampabay.com/hurricane/2023/09/29/florida-home-storm-damage-building-codes-population-boom/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>found</u></a>
that if the storm had struck in the 1970s, it would have caused a third
to a half as much damage. Simply put: You can’t adapt your way out of a
hurricane problem.
</p>
<p>
If there is anyone to talk to about the vulnerabilities unique to Tampa
Bay, it’s Stephen M. Strader, an associate professor and hazard
geographer at Villanova University. Our conversation has been edited and
condensed for clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>You shared
</strong><a href="https://x.com/StephenMStrader/status/1843282278996398432" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>an
image on Twitter</strong></u></a><strong> of the explosive growth in the
Tampa Bay area between 1940 and 2024. Why does this make the region
vulnerable to a storm like Milton? Is it just about there being more
people there?</strong>
</p>
<p>
When we think about disasters, we think of the intersection of three
components: a violent event, like what we have with Milton;
vulnerability, or what types of people could be in the path, which could
be related to racial divides, age, and gender norms; and what a lot of
my work focuses on, exposure.
</p>
<p>
Exposure is just the number of people or things that we care about —
businesses, schools, and things like that — that are subject to losses
if an event occurs. Florida is a great example of rapid urbanization
since the 1900s, and it’s rapid development in a very hazard-prone
region.
</p>
<p>
<strong>It can be easy for outsiders to sit back and wonder why anyone
would buy a house on the water or on a barrier island near
Tampa.</strong>
</p>
<p>
There are a lot of factors that come into play when you think about
where we develop and why we develop certain locations. One of the
biggest pressures that we see is that it’s desirable land: In the short
term, people want to live near the water. It’s beautiful! People don’t
think necessarily about the risk that comes with it because they’re too
focused on their dream, which is to live near the ocean.
</p>
<p>
The other side of that is, from an economic standpoint, people see it as
an opportunity to have businesses and to build condos. Developers see
the land and think, “How much could I buy this for and sell it for with
homes on it?” This really started back with Carl Fisher, who was famous
for building the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. He was a thrill-seeker,
but also a businessman and developer, and he loved to go to South
Florida — which is now Miami Beach, and then was swamps and mangroves
and not developed at all. And he thought, <em><em>Hmm, this would be a
great place for people to visit for vacations and experiences.
</em></em>He slowly started filling in the wetlands with sand. And
that’s the history of Florida’s development: It continued because this
was very valuable land.
</p>
<p>
There is a lot of socioeconomic pressure to develop in these areas, but
we’re also starting to see it change. Those pressures are lessening
because you have insurance industries now and events like this year
after year.
</p>
<p>
<strong>There is another issue in Southwest Florida, which is that many
of the homes were constructed before building codes were
</strong><a href="https://x.com/MarkCBove/status/1843396247039950940" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>updated</strong></u></a><strong>,
right?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I tend to do a lot more work on the manufactured housing side. Before
1974, all manufactured homes were called mobile homes, and there wasn’t
really a standard. Then, in 1974, the United States Department of
Housing and Urban Development came in and said, “We need to increase the
standards,” and they did.
</p>
<p>
Fast-forward to 1992 and Hurricane Andrew, and they realized these codes
were not strong enough. Many people lived in manufactured homes that
were destroyed by Andrew, which was a very windy hurricane. We think
hurricanes are wind threats because of Andrew, but hurricanes are water
threats, and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/noaa-hurricane-forecast-2024#:~:text=90%25%20of%20hurricane%20fatalities%20result%20from%20water" target="_self"><u>most
deaths occur because of that water</u></a>. Andrew was the opposite.
</p>
<p>
Between 1992 and 1994, they updated building codes for manufactured
housing, and actually, along the coastline, Florida has some of the
strongest codes for manufactured homes in the country. A lot of the
areas that will be affected by Milton will have those strong standards.
But many homes were also grandfathered in if they were built before that
time.
</p>
<p>
That’s just one type of housing. My guess is that when you have a lot of
rapid development since the 1990s — well, I have some questions about
structural integrity since building codes can be strong but they might
not be followed. And we sometimes don’t know until afterwards. A lot of
what is being built are condos or McMansions — it’s basically,
<em><em>How fast can you build them, how cheap can you build them, and
how high can you sell them? </em></em>And they look great until their
performance is put into question.
</p>
<p>
Insurance companies are starting to see this and ask, “How do we
retrofit structures?” Structure-wise, though, I think Tampa is in a
decent spot. The problem is, the water is so powerful that it’s not
going to matter.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What kinds of conversations do you think Floridians should be
having about development or potential redevelopment after
Milton?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I’m a huge proponent of resisting the urge to build right back — the
reason being that’s how you get repetitive losses. The hard part is,
with a lot of insurance, if you have it, you only get provisions to
build back the way you were. You don’t have the ability to improve. So
what I end up telling people is, sometimes these disasters provide an
opportunity to assess what we need to do from a planning standpoint.
This is unsustainable development, and not just because of hurricanes,
but because of rising sea levels and the stress on the environment. And
unfortunately, a lot of these developments were built on top of wetlands
and marshes and mangroves that used to protect the island areas as
natural barriers.
</p>
<p>
The hard part is that people’s emotions are very strong after disasters,
and they immediately want to return to how things were. That’s why you
see people picking up the pieces the day after a storm, sometimes even
when they’re injured. So we have to resist the urge as a group, and say,
maybe this isn’t the time to think about rebuilding here.
</p>
<p>
Many wetland restoration projects in Florida are doing that very thing:
reclaiming the environments that protected people inland. But on the
other side you have developers and builders and local economies that
rely on people coming to these areas, and that pressures people to come
right back. Then you end up with a situation of repetitive losses and
that’s why FEMA has been losing money over the years — it’s not so much
that we’re putting money toward disasters but that we’re not getting
value out of it, because it’s so much more likely for there to be
impacts because<em> </em>of that exposure growth. Look at what happened
after Helene and what’s going to happen with Milton: We’re splitting
resources between the two. But we’re doing the best with the tools we
have when there’s pressure on both sides, and considerations both
economic and safety.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Is there anything else people should know about the geography of
Tampa or the development risk there?</strong>
</p>
<p>
This storm is going to be different than other storms, and that’s
because of the direction and intensity of it. The one thing we have to
remember is that all that development — and everybody, for the most
part, who isn’t 100 years old — has not experienced a hurricane of this
magnitude in their life. That means everyone has the cognitive bias to
say, “I’ve been through hurricanes before and was fine.” That is
probably not going to be the case with this event; no one has been
through this before.
</p>
<p>
What’s worrisome to me is that the trajectory of the hurricane is
changing. A subtle shift north or south by 20 miles could mean a big
difference for the Tampa region — if you have the right side of the
hurricane push water into the Bay, it’s no different than 10 people
jumping into a hot tub. The water level goes up and forces all that
water into a smaller region, which is going to lead to more storm surge
in Tampa Bay, Clearwater, and the St. Pete area. I don’t want to call it
a “perfect storm,” but if you push all that water in there, you’re going
to flood people in a way that hurricanes they’ve been through before
never got close to. And I worry, if it goes south, about Fort Myers and
the areas that were hit hard by Hurricane Ian. So it’s multilayered.
</p>
<p>
The good news that I’ll bring up is that we’re reeling from Helene,
which means people have it in their brains about how bad this can be,
which is probably causing more people to evacuate than normal. We have a
problem with disaster amnesia in places where a hurricane hasn’t
happened in a long time so “it’s not going to happen again.” And we
forget. I remember Hurricane Katrina and what it did to New Orleans. It
still has effects, but the students I’m teaching now weren’t even alive
when it hit. These memories are short, and many people in Florida today
weren’t there 30 years ago or 20 years ago. The only good thing to come
out of Helene is that people are now aware of what can happen.

id="republicans-democrats-work-to-preempt-fraud-claims-ahead-of-election">Republicans,
Democrats work to preempt fraud claims ahead of election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ANN ARBOR, FLINT AND DETROIT, MICHIGAN — U.S. election officials in
battleground states are pushing back against disinformation about
election integrity and working to assure Americans that their votes will
be counted.</p>
<p>Officials from both major parties in six states — Arizona, Georgia,
Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — met in Ann Arbor,
Michigan, last month for panel discussions hosted by the nonpartisan
group Keep our Republic. The group seeks to educate the American public
about threats to the U.S. election system and build trust in the
electoral system.</p>
<p>They’re working to avoid a repeat of November 2020 scenes in nearby
Detroit and other American cities where supporters of then-President
Donald Trump, riled up by his baseless accusations of election fraud,
pressured officials to stop counting the votes.</p>
<p>This year, many Trump supporters who spoke with VOA say they worry
about fraud in this election.</p>
<p>“Right now, our government, you’re going to question everything about
it,” said Marvin Minton, a Trump supporter who attended the Republican
presidential nominee’s town hall event in Flint, Michigan, in September.
“I wish I could say differently, but that’s not how America feels. We
don’t trust nobody.”</p>
<p>Angelina Kandow, who was also at the Flint event, said, “Was [the
2020 election] stolen or not? One case, one case is enough to question
the whole system.”</p>
<p>Some Trump supporters quoted alleged instances of 2020 election fraud
that were disproven during court cases triggered by the more than 60
lawsuits filed by Republicans and the Trump campaign after that year’s
election.</p>
<p>Disinformation around election integrity has gained traction among
Republicans, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public
Affairs Research and USAFacts poll, released in August.</p>
<p>The poll found 67% of Republicans trust Trump and his campaign for
accurate information on the outcome of the election. Only 51% of
Republicans said they trust the government’s certification of election
results.</p>
<p>In contrast, 87% of Democrats trust government certifications, while
82% trust Vice President Kamala Harris, the party’s presidential
nominee, and her campaign.</p>
<p>Dangerous disinformation</p>
<p>Officials in battleground states say disinformation can be
dangerous.</p>
<p>“They can in some cases lead to people making threats to election
officials or worse, based on lies or misinformation they have been told
about elections,” said Jonathan Brater, director of the Michigan Bureau
of Elections.</p>
<p>“Even if it doesn’t result in any sort of physical violence, it does
undermine trust long term in the election system, which is bad for our
republic and is bad for our democracy,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>Meagan Wolfe, an election official in Wisconsin, another battleground
state, has been targeted with intimidation, even death threats.
Republicans loyal to Trump have attempted to oust her over false claims
that she helped to rig the 2020 vote in favor of President Joe
Biden.</p>
<p>Wolfe encouraged people who don’t trust the election process to
become involved.</p>
<p>“They can become a poll worker. They can become a poll observer. They
can watch the audits of the voting equipment,” she told VOA.” All of
that is open for [the] public to view.”</p>
<p>In many states, efforts to ensure voters that elections are secure
are supported by Republicans. Justin Roebuck, a Republican election
official in Ottawa County, Michigan, acknowledges it’s an uphill
battle.</p>
<p>“Our political leaders at every level need to also seek facts and to
seek data,” he told VOA. “And I think until that happens, we will have a
problem in terms of our confidence and trust in the process.”</p>
<p>Roebuck said he is working directly with citizens, instead of through
the campaigns.</p>
<p>“We have very decentralized elections in the United States. There are
always things that we can do better,” he said. “Sometimes we have to
work through those challenges and work through those messes.”</p>
<p>Messy in Michigan</p>
<p>It’s already looking like it could become messy in Michigan.
Republicans loyal to Trump have sued Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson,
a Democrat, over absentee ballot processing guidelines and voter
registration lists.</p>
<p>“If Jocelyn Benson is not responding to what is required under the
law, we will take her to court to get the courts to compel her to do
that,” Michigan Republican Party chairperson Pete Hoekstra told VOA.</p>
<p>Benson dismissed it as a Republican strategy to create a “false sense
of irregularities in the process.”</p>
<p>“In general, we see lawsuits masquerading as a legal strategy when
they’re really a PR strategy to get misinformation or sow seeds of doubt
about our elections into the narrative,” she told VOA.</p>
<p>She said that there are “more checks and balances in place than ever
before” to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the election
process.</p>
<p>Both parties have launched election-related lawsuits in various
battleground states, which could mean chaos in the November
election.</p>
<p>“Any kind of legal challenge happening this close to an election,
typically, is lawyers putting a placeholder in case they may not win in
a state or may not have an outcome they like, and it gives them the
ability to challenge the election after the fact,” said Kim Wyman,
senior fellow with the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Elections Project in
Washington.</p>
<p>There are other potential disruptions, including efforts to delay
election certification by county officials who support Trump.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen some legal maneuvers and some boards of elections that
have changed the rules that allow more scrutiny over the canvas period
and the certification of the election,” Wyman told VOA.</p>
<p>After Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 loss culminated in the
January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters, Congress
sought to prevent such events from recurring by passing the Electoral
Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act.</p>
<p>Mandatory deadline</p>
<p>The reforms set a new mandatory December 11 deadline for states to
submit certified slates of presidential electors, provided expedited
court access to resolve challenges and raised the threshold for
objecting to election results in Congress.</p>
<p>Battleground states Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and North
Carolina have passed legislation to ensure that canvasses, recounts,
audits and legal challenges meet the new deadline.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have not, leaving their electoral systems
vulnerable to partisan lawsuits and political pressures that could force
them to miss the certification deadline.</p>
<p>This could leave uncertain the fate of 29 electoral college votes. A
presidential candidate needs at least 270 electoral college votes to
win.</p>

retooling the factory to produce electric vehicles and EV batteries, and
suing the union for threatening to strike in response.
</p>
<p>
The dispute illustrates a new turn in the EV transition. Whereas last
year auto workers were wary of the transition and fighting to keep their
jobs intact, now their jobs are dependent on that transition actually
happening, and happening soon. The UAW is
<a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/chrysler/2024/08/20/stellantis-uaw-belvidere-assembly-plant-strike-reopening/74869725007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>concerned
that the company will delay the plant’s reopening</u></a> until 2028 —
after the union’s contract expires.
</p>
<p>
Stellantis idled the Belvidere plant, which previously produced Jeep
Cherokees, in February 2023, laying off more than 1,300 workers. But
under its agreement with the UAW, the company said it would spend nearly
$5 billion to restart the factory. The contract includes commitments to
opening a parts distribution hub there this year, producing a new
mid-size truck there by 2027, and building an electric vehicle battery
plant at the site by 2028. Not only would jobs at Belvidere be restored,
but the battery plant was expected to employ an additional 1,300 people.
Former Belvidere employees would also be reclassified as temporary
layoffs and receive partial pay and full healthcare benefits until
operations started up again.
</p>
<p>
President Joe Biden celebrated Belvidere as a “great comeback story” in
his
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/03/07/remarks-of-president-joe-biden-state-of-the-union-address-as-prepared-for-delivery-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>State
of the Union speech</u></a> in March. “Instead of an auto factory
shutting down, an auto factory is reopening and a new state-of-the-art
battery factory is being built to power those cars,” he said. “Instead
of a town being left behind it’s a community moving forward again!”
</p>
<p>
In July, plans to turn Belvidere into an EV hub seemed to be taking
shape when the Department of Energy selected Stellantis for a $335
million grant to transition the plant’s assembly lines to be able to
produce electric vehicles. The
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/mesc/domestic-manufacturing-conversion-grant-program" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>grant
website</u></a> says the project was anticipated to incorporate
“significant upgrades” to the plant’s infrastructure and re-employ about
“1,450 unionized and highly skilled employees.” Stellantis, however, did
not issue any press releases about the grant. In a
<a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/07/11/stellantis-grant/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>statement
to the </u><u><em><em>Chicago Tribune</em></em></u></a>, the company
said it was “an important step in continuing to work toward finalizing a
sustainable solution” for Belvidere.
</p>
<p>
About a month later, the narrative around Belvidere started to shift.
UAW president Shawn Fain
<a href="https://x.com/UAW/status/1824547479074775502" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>posted
a video</u></a> on social media claiming something was “rotten” at
Stellantis and accused the company of “putting the brakes” on its plans
to reopen the plant. On August 20,
<a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=26081&mid=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Stellantis
confirmed</u></a> that “plans for Belvidere will be delayed,” though it
“firmly stands by its commitment” to reopen the plant. The company’s
explanation for the decision was vague and did not include a new
timeline. “To ensure the Company’s future competitiveness and
sustainability,” it said, “it is critical that the business case for all
investments is aligned with market conditions and our ability to
accommodate a wide range of consumer demands.”
</p>
<p>
As it stands, the business is not exactly in a sustainable place. In
July, Stellantis reported that its U.S. revenues were down 16% compared
to the first half of last year. Declining sales have left dealerships
with a glut of inventory. Fain blames the company’s poor performance on
its CEO Carlos Tavares, questioning how “market conditions” could be
holding back investments in Belvidere when Tavares took a 56% raise last
year, “making him the highest paid auto executive outside of Tesla.”
</p>
<p>
In response, the company
<a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=26271&mid=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>published
a fact check of the union’s claims,</u></a> which notes that “there is
indisputable volatility in the market, especially as the industry
transitions to an electrified future. Over the past year, numerous
companies across the industry have announced investment and product
delays as well as outright product cancellations.” Stellantis currently
sells just one EV in the U.S., the Fiat 500e, which it
<a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=25708&mid=351" target="_blank">manufactures
in Italy</a>; in September, the company announced it had suspended
production due to
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/stellantis-pauses-production-electric-fiat-500-due-poor-demand-2024-09-12/" target="_blank"><u>poor
sales</u></a>, though it still has several new EV models slated to
launch later this year.
</p>
<p>
More than a dozen local UAW units all over the country filed grievances
against Stellantis in August, arguing that the company’s “failure to
plan for, fund and launch these programs constitute a violation” of its
contract. The union has threatened to strike if the grievances are not
addressed, citing its “right to strike over product and investment
commitments” — another provision of the 2023 contract.
</p>
<p>
Stellantis denies that it has violated the contract and thrown the
accusation back at UAW, noting that the agreement included a clause that
says it is understood that the investments are “contingent upon plant
performance, changes in market conditions, and consumer demand.” It has
since
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/stellantis-files-new-suits-against-united-auto-workers-union-2024-10-07/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>filed
eight lawsuits</u></a> against the union and several of its locals for
threatening to strike.
</p>
<p>
The company has also not completely abandoned its plans for the EV
transition. A few weeks ago, it
<a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=26153" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced</u></a>
it would invest more than $406 million to prepare three Michigan
factories for EV production. During a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urAJ4gmSqZE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>livestream</u></a>
in September, Fain wrote off those investments as representing just a
small portion of what the company committed to.
</p>
<p>
In response to questions about why investment in Belvidere was delayed,
whether the company would still pursue the federal grant, or what the
new timeline for the plant was, a representative from Stellantis sent me
bullet points from the previously published fact check.
</p>
<p>
The Department of Energy did not answer questions about the status or
timeline for the factory conversion grant.

2024</a> report, published this morning. It says that the world is on
track to add 5,500 gigawatts of new clean energy capacity by 2030, 80%
of which will come from solar PV alone. That means renewables will
account for half of global electricity generation by the end of the
decade.

While this is huge progress (the report notes that 5,500 GW is roughly
equal the power capacity of China, the European Union, India, and the
U.S. combined), it is not enough to meet the COP28 goal of tripling
renewable capacity by 2030. But! The IEA stresses that it is “entirely
possible” to meet this target if governments can get their acts
together, set bold new emission reduction targets in the coming months,
and work together to lower the energy transition costs for poorer
countries. “The market can deliver on renewables, and now governments
need to prioritize investing in storage, grids, and other forms of clean
flexibility to enable this transformation,” said Dave Jones, director of
global insights at energy think tank Ember. “The next half decade is
going to be one heck of a ride.”

<p>
So, that’s renewables. Let’s look at what all this means for emissions
and, most importantly, warming.

published this morning from Norwegian risk management company DNV
concludes, rather remarkably, that energy-related emissions are set to
peak this year and begin a steady decline thanks to the plummeting costs
of solar and batteries, especially in China. “Emissions peaking is a
milestone for humanity,” said Remi Eriksen, group president and CEO of
DNV. However, the projected rate of emission reduction is only enough to
limit warming to <strong>2.2 degrees Celsius </strong>by 2100. “We must
now focus on how quickly emissions decline and use the available tools
to accelerate the energy transition,” Eriksen added.

Outlook 2024</a> report, out yesterday, concluded that there is a less
than 7% chance of the world limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius
“if current trends in policy and technology development continue.” In
fact, it projected a “very likely” increase between<strong> 2 degrees
Celsius</strong> and <em>gulp</em> <strong>3.7 degrees Celsius
</strong>by century’s end. However, odds of limiting warming to 2
degrees jump to 96% if all countries can get to net-zero emissions by
2070. To date, 149 countries (representing 88% of global emissions) have
made net-zero or carbon neutrality commitments, though it remains to be
seen if and when they’ll meet those goals.

The cost of “green” hydrogen – that which is produced with clean energy
– is likely to remain “prohibitively expensive,” according to a new

published yesterday in the journal <em>Joule</em>. The fuel is seen as
key to curbing emissions from hard-to-abate sectors (industry, for
example), and many are banking on the price of production falling. But
the researchers say the high storage and distribution costs are often
overlooked. Taking those costs into consideration, carbon capture and
storage is cheaper than green hydrogen when it comes to curbing
emissions, the researchers found. “Even if production costs decrease in
line with predictions, storage and distribution costs will prevent
hydrogen being cost-competitive in many sectors,”

<h2
id="study-climate-change-made-deadly-hurricane-helene-more-intense">Study:
Climate change made deadly Hurricane Helene more intense</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Hurricane Helene’s torrential rain and powerful winds
were made about 10% more intense due to climate change, according to a
study published Wednesday by the World Weather Attribution (WWA)
group.  </p>
<p>Although a 10% increase “might seem relatively small… that small
change in the hazard really leads to big change in impacts and damage,”
said climate scientist Friederike Otto, who heads the research
organization.  </p>
<p>The study also found that fossil fuels — the primary cause of climate
change — have made hurricanes like Helene 2.5 times more likely to
occur.  </p>
<p>In other words, storms of Helene’s magnitude were formerly
anticipated once every 130 years, but now the probability is closer to
once every 53 years, on average.  </p>
<p>To conduct the study, researchers focused on three aspects of
Hurricane Helene: precipitation, winds and the water temperature of the
Gulf of Mexico — a key factor in its formation.  </p>
<p>“All aspects of this event were amplified by climate change to
different degrees,” Ben Clarke, a co-author of the study and researcher
at Imperial College London, told a press conference.  </p>
<p>“And we’ll see more of the same as the world continues to warm,” he
continued.  </p>
<p>The research by WWA, an international group of scientists and
meteorologists who study the role of climate change in extreme weather
events, comes as the southeastern US state of Florida prepares for the
arrival of another major hurricane, Milton, just 10 days after it was
hit by Helene.   </p>
<p>Destruction</p>
<p>Helene made landfall in northwestern Florida on September 26 as a
Category 4 hurricane with winds up to 140 mph (225 kph).  </p>
<p>The storm then moved north, causing heavy rain and devastating floods
in several states, including North Carolina, where it claimed the
highest death toll.  </p>
<p>The authors of the study emphasized that the risk posed by hurricanes
has increased in scope beyond coastal areas.  </p>
<p>Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at NGO Climate Central,
said Helene “had so much intensity” that it would take time for it to
lose strength, but the “storm was moving fast… so it could go farther
inland pretty quickly.”  </p>
<p>This study utilized three methodologies to examine the three aspects
of the storm, and was conducted by researchers from the US, the UK,
Sweden and the Netherlands.  </p>
<p>To study its rainfall, researchers used an approach based on both
observation and climate models, depending on the two regions involved:
one for coastal areas like Florida, and another for inland areas like
the Appalachian mountains.  </p>
<p>In both cases, the study found precipitation had increased by 10
percent because of global warming, which is currently at 1.3 degrees
Celsius above pre-industrial levels.  </p>
<p>To study Helene’s winds, scientists looked at hurricane data dating
back as far as 1900.  </p>
<p>They determined Helene’s winds were 11 percent stronger, or 13 mph
(21 kph), as a result of climate change.  </p>
<p>Lastly, the researchers examined the water temperature in the Gulf of
Mexico, where Helene formed, finding it was around 2 degrees Celsius
above normal.  </p>
<p>This record temperature was made 200 to 500 times more likely due to
climate change, the study asserts.  </p>
<p>Warmer oceans release more water vapor, providing more energy for
storms as they form.  </p>
<p>“If humans continue to burn fossil fuels, the US will face even more
destructive hurricanes,” Clarke warned in a statement.</p>

<h2 id="us-urges-peaceful-resolution-of-any-taiwan-disputes">US urges
peaceful resolution of any Taiwan disputes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A top U.S. official said the United States expects
differences across the Taiwan Strait to be resolved peacefully and
opposes any unilateral changes to the status quo as Taiwan prepares to
celebrate the founding of the Republic of China on Thursday.</p>
<p>The People’s Republic of China, or PRC, celebrates its national day
on October 1, marking the founding of the country in 1949. Taiwan
chooses October 10, known as Double Ten Day, to celebrate the founding
of the ROC in 1912, just months after an uprising that began on October
10, 1911.</p>
<p>The PRC typically closely monitors speeches from Taiwan’s leaders
during Double Ten Day celebrations. Since Taiwan’s democratically
elected President Lai Ching-te took office in May, Beijing has increased
military pressure on Taiwan, deeming Lai a “separatist.”</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific
Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink said that the U.S.’s “fundamental interest is
in the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,”
reiterating that Washington’s longstanding One China policy remains
unchanged, “guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three Joint
Communiques and the Six Assurances.”</p>
<p>“We oppose unilateral changes to the status quo by either side. We do
not support Taiwan independence, and we expect cross-strait differences
to be resolved peacefully,” Kritenbrink told VOA during a briefing.</p>
<p>Speaking at an event Saturday, Lai noted that the PRC celebrated its
75th anniversary on October 1, and in a few days, it would be the ROC’s
113th birthday.</p>
<p>“In terms of age, it is absolutely impossible for the People’s
Republic of China to be considered the motherland of the people of the
Republic of China. On the contrary, the ROC may be the motherland of the
people of the PRC who are over 75 years old,” Lai told an audience in
Taipei.</p>
<p>PRC officials have remained largely muted on Lai’s remarks, but some
analysts say that could be because Beijing is preparing to launch
another round of military exercises after Lai delivers his Double Ten
Day speech.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have referred inquiries to “President Lai’s office for
any commentary on his specific comments.”</p>
<p>European visit</p>
<p>Meanwhile, former Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen will visit the
Czech Republic this month, a visit seen as sensitive since Beijing has
repeatedly denounced the democratic leader as a “separatist.”</p>
<p>In Beijing on Tuesday, a spokesperson from the PRC’s Ministry of
Foreign Affairs was asked to comment on Tsai’s planned visit to
Prague.</p>
<p>“We firmly oppose anyone who seeks “Taiwan independence” visiting
countries with diplomatic ties with China under any pretext. We urge the
Czech Republic and relevant countries to earnestly abide by the One
China principle and respect China’s sovereignty and territorial
integrity,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told
reporters Tuesday.</p>
<p>Taiwan has been self-ruled since 1949, when Mao Zedong’s communists
took power in Beijing after defeating Chiang Kai-shek’s Kuomintang
nationalists in a civil war, prompting the nationalists’ relocation to
the island.</p>
<p>The U.S. does not maintain an official relationship with Taiwan but
provides defense equipment to the self-ruled democracy under the Taiwan
Relations Act.</p>
<p>Treaty of Aigun</p>
<p>In a TV interview in September, Lai remarked that if China’s claims
over Taiwan are genuinely rooted in concerns about territorial
integrity, it should also seek to reclaim the land it ceded to Russia in
the 19th century.</p>
<p>He referenced the 1858 Treaty of Aigun, through which China, under
the Qing dynasty, gave up a vast area of land — now part of Russia’s Far
East — to the Russian Empire, establishing much of the modern border
along the Amur River.</p>
<p>The Treaty of Aigun, along with the 1860 Convention of Peking, saw
China relinquish 600,000 square kilometers — an area almost the size of
Ukraine — to the Russian Empire, enabling Russia to establish a naval
base at Vladivostok. Many Chinese people still brood over this period of
history, harboring lingering resentment over the fact that the land once
belonged to China before being annexed by Russia.</p>
<p>In 2023, China’s Ministry of Natural Resources mandated that new maps
use Chinese names for Vladivostok — Haishenwai — as well as several
other cities in the region.</p>

How can you fight climate change in your daily life? Last month, Heatmap
published our attempt at answering that question: Called Decarbonize
Your Life, it’s a series of stories and guides to help you make better,
smarter decisions to nudge the energy system away from fossil fuels. We
consulted studies, ran our own analysis (with a little help from some
friends), and used our expert judgment to arrive at six big,
high-leverage actions you can take to fight climate change and cut
carbon pollution.

<p>
On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Jesse and Rob speak with Heatmap’s
deputy editor Jillian Goodman and founding staff writer Emily Pontecorvo
about what those six big actions are, how the guide came together, and
why big choices matter so much more than small ones. Shift Key is hosted
by Robinson Meyer, the founding executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>So it’s more than just the carbon impact
which is the key here, right? This systemic leverage point that you’re
trying to make is that you’re trying to think about — beyond just
reducing emissions, which is important — how is that actually having
some kind of systemic impact on reorienting the global capitalist
system, right? That we all live in, towards where we want to go, towards
what a net zero emissions lifestyle and society looks like.<br/> <br/>
<strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>And instead of every dollar you spend
going to the task of taking oil out of the ground, and the task of
building more internal combustion cars, it’s going to the task of
building more EVs and harvesting electricity. Anyway, Jillian, I
interrupted you.<br/> <br/> <strong>Jillian Goodman: </strong>I was just
going to add — and again, I’m just paraphrasing you — every time you
drive, it’s a marginal impact. Every single time you use the device. Not
only are you emitting less in the short term, you’re emitting less in
the long term. And as the grid gets cleaner, every time you drive your
EV, your EV will get cleaner, as well.<br/> <br/> <strong>Emily
Pontecorvo:</strong> One other thing that we were thinking about a
little bit is thinking about these actions in terms of, which ones are
you, as an individual, you’re literally the one who’s burning the fossil
fuels. When you drive your car, you are burning the gas. When you’re
lighting your stove, you’re burning natural gas. And not to put it all
on the individual, but you’re the one who has the power to say,
<em><em>Okay, I’m not gonna burn fossil fuels in my home
anymore.</em></em> And whereas with a few other actions — like with
rooftop solar, with efficiency improvements — those are extremely
important, and those are very high on our list for other reasons. But
they’re more indirect.

Climate Change Is Supercharging Hurricane Milton</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p>
Contrary to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-milton-misinformation" target="_self"><u>recent
rumor</u></a>, the U.S. government cannot direct major hurricanes like
Helene and Milton toward red states. According to two new rapid
attribution studies by World Weather Attribution and
<a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/hurricane-rapid-intensification?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Climate%20Shift%20Index%20Alert%20-%20Hurricane%20Milton%20Oct%207%202024&utm_content=Climate%20Shift%20Index%20Alert%20-%20Hurricane%20Milton%20Oct%207%202024+CID_5a4c73076a532c0cb91ebd2b7e99e07f&utm_source=Climate%20Central%20Email%20Campaign%20Monitor&utm_term=extreme%20rapid%20intensification" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Climate
Central</u></a>, however, human actors almost certainly made the storms
a lot worse through the burning of fossil fuels.
</p>
<p>
A storm like Hurricane Helene, which has
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-death-study" target="_self"><u>killed
at least 227 people so far</u></a> and caused close to
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/07/business/property-damange-hurricane-helene-47-billion/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$50
billion in estimated property losses</u></a> across the southeast, is
about two-and-a-half times more likely in the region today compared to
what would be expected in a “cooler pre-industrial climate,” WWA found.
That means Helene, the kind of storm one would expect to see once every
130 years on average, is now expected to develop at a rate of about once
every 53 years. Additionally, WWA researchers determined that extreme
rainfall from Helene was 70% more likely and 10% heavier in the
Appalachians and about 40% more likely in the southern Appalachian
region, where many of the deaths occurred, due to climate change.
</p>
<p>
“Americans shouldn’t have to fear hurricanes more violent than Helene —
we have all the knowledge and technology needed to lower demand and
replace oil, gas, and coal with renewable energy,” Friederike Otto, the
lead of WWA and a senior lecturer in climate science at Imperial College
London, said in a statement. “But vitally, we need the political will.”
Alarmingly, the attribution study found that storms could drop an
additional 10% or more rain on average as soon as the 2050s if warming
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/year-warming-paris-agreement" target="_self"><u>reaches</u></a>
2 degrees Celsius.
</p>
<p>
WWA’s study is
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/helene-rainfall-boosted-human-driven-climate-change-studies-find-rcna173608" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not
the first</a> to be released on Hurricane Helene, but it was still
produced incredibly quickly and has not been peer reviewed. Just a few
weeks ago, the group issued a correction on a report estimating the
contribution of climate change to recent
<a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/climate-change-and-high-exposure-increased-costs-and-disruption-to-lives-and-livelihoods-from-flooding-associated-with-exceptionally-heavy-rainfall-in-central-europe/" target="_blank">flooding
in Europe</a>.
</p>
<p>
Separately, Climate Central looked at Hurricane Milton, which already
has the distinction of being
<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/hurricane-milton-category-5-storm-fifth-strongest-ever-atlantic-1965604" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
fifth strongest</u></a> Atlantic storm on record. The nonprofit’s
findings show that Milton’s rapid intensification — one of
<a href="https://theconversation.com/hurricane-milton-explodes-into-a-powerful-category-5-storm-as-it-heads-for-florida-heres-how-rapid-intensification-works-240754" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
fastest and most powerful</u></a> instances of the phenomenon in history
— is primarily due to high
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-season-2024" target="_self"><u>sea
surface temperatures</u></a> in the weeks before Milton developed, which
was made at least 400 times more likely by climate change and up to 800
times more likely. (WWA relied on Climate Central’s Climate Shift Index
for oceans for its research, but found “climate change made the
unusually hot sea surface temperature about 200-500 times more likely.”)
</p>
<p>
Attribution science is incredibly tricky, especially for a storm system
like a hurricane that has variables ranging from wind shear to the El
Niño–Southern Oscillation to ocean temperatures and jet stream
variations. When
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/is-extreme-weather-climate-change" target="_self"><u>I
spoke to a member of the WWA team earlier this year</u></a>, I was told
the organization specifically avoids attributing the intensification of
any <em><em>individual</em></em> hurricane — in theory, one of the more
straightforward relationships — to climate change because of the
relatively limited historical modeling available. Even something like
rainfall “is not necessarily correlated to the magnitude of the floods
that you see because there are other factors,” WWA’s Clair Barnes
previously told me — for example, the steep-sided mountains and hollows
of western North Carolina, which served as funnels for rainfall to an
especially devastating effect.
</p>
<p>
But regarding the relationship between hurricanes and climate change
more generally, “We’re relatively confident that storms will get more
intense” in a warming world, Gabriel Vecchi, a Princeton geoscientist,
explained on
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-s2-hurricane-helene" target="_self"><u>a
recent episode of Heatmap’s Shift Key</u></a> podcast. “And we’re
<em><em>really </em></em>confident that storms will get wetter.”
</p>
<p>
Helene and Milton hammer that point home: once-in-a-generation storms
can now arrive on back-to-back weekends. You can almost understand the
impulse to devise a zany explanation as to why. Only, the truth is far
simpler than cloud seeding or
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-maui-fire-photos-misrepresented-conspiracy-555091357957" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>space
lasers</u></a>: a warmer atmosphere makes for warmer oceans, which make
for wetter, more intense storms. And while hurricane seasons
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/2024-hurricane-season-helene#:~:text=a%20couple%20of%20named%20storms%20in%20November%2C" target="_self"><u>eventually
end</u></a>, global temperatures
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/climate-track-warm-by-nearly-3c-without-greater-ambition-un-report-2023-11-20/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>haven’t
stopped going up</u></a>. That, perhaps, is the more terrifying subtext
of the attribution studies: There will be more Miltons and Helenes.
