sustained significant damage. While deaths have been reported, it’s not
yet clear how many. More than 3 million people are without power.

Before the storm hit, the Florida Department of Financial Services

Latin America, which is home to some of the most biodiverse regions in
the world, saw the worst losses, at 95%. Freshwater species experienced
the greatest decline at 85%. There are some success stories, such as a
3% increase in the mountain gorilla population, and the incredible
comeback of the European Bison, but generally the report is pretty
heartbreaking. It underscores the interconnected nature of the climate
crisis and nature destruction. “It really does indicate to us that the

<li>IMO boss says shipping industry must target ‘low hanging fruit’ to

The head of the International Maritime Organization this week called on
the shipping industry to do more to cut emissions from the sector.
Shipping accounts for about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The
IMO recently set a new industry-wide target of a 20% emissions reduction
by 2030, and net-zero by 2050. But the IMO’s Arsenio Dominguez said
there is more to be done to hit these goals. That includes “low hanging
fruit” like reducing ship speed, charting routes according to the
weather, and cleaning the hulls of ships to reduce friction, <em><em>The
Associated Press</em></em>

change in US swing state’s election rules alarms some</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>leesburg, georgia — In the town of Leesburg in the U.S. state of
Georgia, slightly more than a dozen election workers sit at card tables,
each thumbing through stacks of 50 blank pieces of paper, practicing
counting ballots by hand.</p>
<p>With the U.S. presidential vote only weeks away, the Georgia State
Election Board, led by a pro-Donald Trump majority, passed a
controversial requirement in September that counties manually hand count
their ballots, a move that has caused alarm in the closely watched swing
state.</p>
<p>Veronica Johnson, who is leading the training session as the Lee
County director of elections and registration, says hand counting the
ballots is unlikely to pose major operational problems in her small
county.</p>
<p>But logistics are far from election officials’ only concern.</p>
<p>Georgia officials from both sides of the political aisle say the
count is not only superfluous — machines already count the ballots — but
also a potential tool to sow doubt by slowing the process and creating
space for disinformation should discrepancies arise via error-prone
human counting.</p>
<p>“I don’t feel it’s necessary. I have no problem saying that. I think
that at our precincts here in Lee County we’re already balancing our
numbers,” Johnson told AFP.</p>
<p>The change is all the most notable given Republican candidate Trump’s
alleged election tampering in the state in 2020, pushing for Georgia
officials to “find” enough votes to overturn President Joe Biden’s
victory.</p>
<p>‘Misguided’</p>
<p>Lee is among Georgia’s 159 counties, which encompass major
metropolitan areas such as Atlanta and rural regions like the area
surrounding Leesburg, with populations ranging from majority white to
majority Black.</p>
<p>Like many of its rural counterparts, Lee County voted heavily in 2020
for Trump, who received 72 percent of its votes.</p>
<p>Poll workers such as those at the training will be stationed across
the county’s 10 voting precincts on November 5, when U.S. voters choose
between Trump and his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, in
addition to candidates in hundreds of down-ballot races.</p>
<p>Because of lawsuits, Johnson is unsure if hand counting will actually
happen.</p>
<p>“Honestly, every election director I know really just wants to serve
the people and not get bogged down by the political ramifications,” she
said, emphasizing that ballots are already counted by machine three
times.</p>
<p>Calling the rule change “misguided,” Georgia’s Republican Secretary
of State Brad Raffensperger said that “activists seeking to impose
last-minute changes in election procedures” only “undermine voter
confidence and burden election workers,” while Georgia’s Republican
attorney general has stated the new rule is likely illegal.</p>
<p>The Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Party of Georgia
sued to block the rule last week with the Harris campaign’s backing.</p>
<p>‘Untrusting’</p>
<p>The state election board passed the rule by a three-to-two vote —
those in favor being staunch Trump backers praised by the ex-president
as “pit bulls” fighting for “victory.”</p>
<p>Along the same three-to-two lines, the board passed another rule in
August allowing county election boards to conduct a “reasonable inquiry”
before certifying results.</p>
<p>Like the hand count requirement, the measure is being challenged in
court, with critics particularly worried about the vagueness of the word
“reasonable.”</p>
<p>Mitchell Brown, director of the election administration program at
Auburn University in Alabama, told Agence France-Presse that such a rule
is unnecessary given that election officials “have meetings regularly
where they go through the documentation and the information with the
certifying body.”</p>
<p>“The bigger, more interesting question to me is, what happens if a
body chooses not to certify?”</p>
<p>Back in Lee County, Donna Mathis, who has served as a poll worker
since 2018, noted that the “country is divided so much.”</p>
<p>Asked about the hand count and reasonable inquiry rule, she said,
“the hand count doesn’t bother me” given how quickly they were able to
tabulate the votes.</p>
<p>But “I think you can inquire too much, it ties things up,” she added.
“People are just so untrusting anymore that they question
everything.”</p>

<h2
id="though-voter-fraud-rare-us-election-offices-feature-safeguards-to-catch-it">Though
voter fraud rare, US election offices feature safeguards to catch
it</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — You’ve heard the horror stories: Someone casting multiple
ballots, people voting in the name of dead relatives, mail-in ballots
being intercepted. </p>
<p>Voter fraud does happen occasionally. When it does, we tend to hear a
lot about it. It also gets caught and prosecuted. </p>
<p>The nation’s multilayered election processes provide many safeguards
that keep voter fraud generally detectable and rare, according to
current and former election administrators of both parties. </p>
<p>America’s elections are decentralized, with thousands of independent
voting jurisdictions. That makes it virtually impossible to pull off a
large-scale vote-rigging operation that could tip a presidential race —
or almost any other race. </p>
<p>“You’re probably not going to have a perfect election system,” said
Republican Trey Grayson, a former Kentucky secretary of state and the
advisory board chair of the Secure Elections Project. “But if you’re
looking for one that you should have confidence in, you should feel good
about that here in America.” </p>
<p>What’s stopping people from committing voter fraud? </p>
<p>Voting more than once, tampering with ballots, lying about your
residence to vote somewhere else, or casting someone else’s ballot are
crimes that can be punished with hefty fines and prison time. Non-U.S.
citizens who break election laws can be deported. </p>
<p>For anyone still motivated to cheat, election systems in the United
States are designed with multiple layers of protection and transparency
intended to stand in the way. </p>
<p>For in-person voting, most states either require or request voters
provide some sort of ID at the polls. Others require voters to verify
who they are in another way, such as stating their name and address,
signing a poll book or signing an affidavit. </p>
<p>People who try to vote in the name of a recently deceased friend or
family member can be caught when election officials update voter lists
with death records and obituaries, said Gail Pellerin, a Democratic in
the California Assembly who ran elections in Santa Cruz County for more
than 27 years. </p>
<p>Those who try to impersonate someone else run the risk that someone
at the polls knows that person or that the person will later try to cast
their own ballot, she said. </p>
<p>What protections exist for absentee voting? </p>
<p>For absentee voting, different states have different ballot
verification protocols. All states require a voter’s signature. Many
states have further precautions, such as having bipartisan teams compare
the signature with other signatures on file, requiring the signature to
be notarized or requiring a witness to sign. </p>
<p>That means even if a ballot is erroneously sent to someone’s past
address and the current resident mails it in, there are checks to alert
election workers to the foul play. </p>
<p>A growing number of states offer online or text-based ballot tracking
tools as an extra layer of protection, allowing voters to see when their
ballot has been sent out, returned and counted. </p>
<p>Federal law requires voter list maintenance, and election officials
do that through a variety of methods, from checking state and federal
databases to collaborating with other states to track voters who have
moved. </p>
<p>Ballot drop boxes have security protocols, too, said Tammy Patrick,
chief executive officer for programs at the National Association of
Election Officials. </p>
<p>She explained the boxes are often designed to stop hands from
stealing ballots and are surveilled by camera, bolted to the ground and
constructed with fire-retardant chambers, so if someone threw in a lit
match, it wouldn’t destroy the ballots inside. </p>
<p>Sometimes, alleged voter fraud isn’t what it seems </p>
<p>After the 2020 election, social media surged with claims of dead
people casting ballots, double voting or destroyed piles of ballots on
the side of the road. </p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump promoted and has continued to amplify
these claims. But the vast majority of them were found to be
untrue. </p>
<p>An Associated Press investigation that explored every potential case
of voter fraud in the six battleground states disputed by Trump found
there were fewer than 475 out of millions of votes cast. That was not
nearly enough to tip the outcome. Democrat Joe Biden won the six states
by a combined 311,257 votes. </p>
<p>The review also showed no collusion intended to rig the voting.
Virtually every case was based on an individual acting alone to cast
additional ballots. In one case, a man mistakenly thought he could vote
while on parole. In another, a woman was suspected of sending in a
ballot for her dead mother. </p>
<p>Former election officials say that even more often, allegations of
voter fraud turn out to result from a clerical error or a
misunderstanding. </p>
<p>Pellerin said she remembered when a political candidate in her county
raised suspicion about many people being registered to vote at the same
address. It turned out the voters were nuns who all lived in the same
home. </p>
<p>Patrick said that when she worked in elections in Maricopa County,
Arizona, mismatched signatures were sometimes explained by a broken arm
or a recent stroke. In other cases, an elderly person tried to vote
twice because they forgot they had already submitted a mail ballot. </p>
<p>“You really have to think about the intent of the voter,” Patrick
said. “It isn’t always intuitive.” </p>
<p>Why voter fraud is unlikely to affect the presidential race </p>
<p>It would be wrong to suggest that voter fraud never happens. </p>
<p>With millions of votes cast in an election year, it’s almost
guaranteed there will be a few cases of someone trying to game the
system. There also have been more insidious efforts, such as a
vote-buying scheme in 2006 in Kentucky. </p>
<p>In that case, Grayson said, voters complained, and an investigation
ensued. Then participants admitted what they had done. </p>
<p>He said the example shows how important it is for election officials
to stay vigilant and constantly improve security in order to help voters
feel confident. </p>
<p>But, he said, it would be hard to make any such scheme work on a
larger scale. Fraudsters would have to navigate onerous nuances in each
county’s election system. They also would have to keep a large number of
people quiet about a crime that could be caught at any moment by
officials or observers. </p>
<p>“This decentralized nature of the elections is itself a deterrent,”
Grayson said.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
One of the biggest threats to American offshore wind is a handful of
homeowners on the south Jersey shoreline spouting unproven theories
about magnetic fields.
</p>
<p>
Within a year of forming, the activist group “Stop The High-Risk Cables”
has galvanized local politicians against the transmission infrastructure
being planned for wind turbines off the coast of New Jersey known as the
<a href="https://bpuoffshorewind.nj.gov/prebuild-solicitation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Larrabee
Pre-built Infrastructure</u></a>. The transmission route, which will run
a few miles from the beaches of Sea Girt, New Jersey, to a substation
nearby, is expected to be a crucial landing zone for power from major
offshore wind projects in south Jersey waters, including Atlantic
Shores, a joint venture between EDF Renewables and Shell that received
final permits from federal regulators last week.
</p>
<p>
The only problem: while state regulators have been busy planning the
route for the transmission and selecting who will build it, opponents
have managed to win the war of public opinion. Activists have clearly
turned their neighbors against the plan, pushing the mayors of the four
boroughs targeted for Pre-Built Infrastructure to come out against the
project. And this weekend Jack Ciattarelli – who narrowly lost the race
for the governor’s mansion last year and is running again in 2025 –
joined activists rallying against the project and is
<a href="https://x.com/Jack4NJ/status/1842963189891563676" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>now
campaigning</u></a> on ending the project and cable landings like it.
</p>
<p>
Since federal regulators control the waters, what this means is, unless
Democrats hit the electoral jackpot over the next year, offshore wind in
New Jersey could be screwed – even if Kamala Harris wins the White
House.
</p>
<p>
What makes this more dire is, this isn’t any ol’ transmission. For other
offshore wind projects like Empire Wind, states have forced developers
to design and construct their own transmission landings, creating a
somewhat disorganized situation resembling electrical spaghetti. New
Jersey’s offshore wind transmission meanwhile has been studied for years
and is supposed to minimize development on the shoreline. This means the
combat over this cabling could decide the fates of multiple offshore
wind projects – and the first major proactive plan to reduce beach-level
environmental impacts that stymie offshore wind in the first place.
</p>
<p>
So I decided to dive deep into the campaign against the so-called
“high-risk” cables. After a series of interviews with organizers and a
mayor critical of the state’s processes, I’ve been left feeling this
relatively small transmission project represents a true test for
democracy’s role in climate action. Could a small band of organized
individuals be
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/wind-farm-protests-leah-stokes-pnas" target="_self"><u>all
it takes</u></a> to hold back decarbonization at the pace scientists say
is necessary, no matter how many climate laws are passed?
</p>
<h3>
The Magnetic Fields
</h3>
<p>
Sea Girt resident Kimberly Paterson remembers when she first heard about
the cables. Someone had left a postcard on her door about the project.
Before that, the professional executive leadership trainer had devoted
her activism to preserving maritime forests on the beach. Once made
aware of the transmission cables though, she and her small coterie of
environmentally-conscious neighbors got active.
</p>
<p>
Paterson said they also started getting looped in with an existing
network of activists concerned about offshore wind infrastructure. Those
activists included familiar characters to the fight over New Jersey
offshore wind development.
</p>
<p>
People like Mike Dean of Save the East Coast and Cindy Zipf of Clean
Ocean Action, who’ve spread theories without evidence about a spate of
whale deaths being tied to pile drivers for offshore wind. She says her
group’s work is focused on the cables, not offshore wind, despite the
close allyship with these other actors. As she simply put it, “There’s a
circle of people that you meet.”
</p>
<p>
“We do like to work with others, and communicate with others, but we’re
not officially tied to any of those other groups.”
</p>
<p>
The group also started canvassing, making signage for homeowners, and
holding public events. As calls for action grew, so too did the
political focus on the area, as state legislators and members of
Congress took up the issue.
</p>
<p>
“We have created an absolute firestorm here,” Paterson told me. ’It is
unbelievable what we’ve accomplished.”
</p>
<p>
The group is focused on what they believe to be the health risks of
simply being near high-voltage power lines.
</p>
<p>
To understand their fears, think of an electric current going through a
wire. The more current goes through a wire, the higher likelihood of
electrical waves emanating from the current’s pathway. That’s where
“electro-magnetic fields” come into play. These fields are all around us
and even Earth emits them. It’s the result of an excess of energy.
<br/><br/>The World Health Organization
<a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/electromagnetic-fields" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>classifies
even</u></a> low amounts of electromagnetic fields as a possible
carcinogen, citing studies around exposure and childhood leukemia rates.
But as many environmental and health
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/radtown/electric-and-magnetic-fields-power-lines" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>experts
note</u></a>, studies to date have not really linked cancer occurrences
to prolonged exposure to these fields. The Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management
<a href="https://www.boem.gov/sites/default/files/documents/renewable-energy/state-activities/BOEM-Electromagnetic-Fields-Offshore-Wind-Facilities_1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>says
the</u></a> electro-magnetic fields created by cables for offshore wind
“are well below the
</p>
<p>
recommended threshold values for human exposure.” So like whales and
wind, it’s something to watch out for, but there’s no evidence to date
of a danger here. <br/><br/>
</p>
<p>
Nonetheless, seeking to calm any resident’s fears of magnetic fields,
the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities last week convened their first
public hearing within the planned development area.
</p>
<p>
At the event, numerous officials came and spoke to the project’s safety,
including the executive director of the Board. They even played a long
explanatory video from a consultant they hired to review the
electro-magnetic fields that would come from the cables. The full
presentation laid out numerous examples of what they said were similar
underground and underwater transmission lines with magnetic emissions
that had no discernable impact on public health, including lines in the
New Jersey-New York region.
</p>
<p>
One person moved by the presentation’s efforts on magnetic fields was
Mike Mangan, mayor of Manasquan, one of the boroughs that may be
selected to host some of the transmission infrastructure. Mangan told me
he joined with other mayors to press the state for more transparency on
the cables at the behest of concerned constituents. But he didn’t know
what the state knew about the magnetic fields.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll just be candid — I was ignorant on a lot of that,” he
acknowledged. Mangan said he still has “a few very serious concerns” but
“I think they addressed some of the bigger concerns,” including the
magnetic fields.
</p>
<p>
I’ll admit, I felt the same. So far in The Fight, we’ve chronicled
examples where there are at least somewhat reasonable concerns about
renewable energy development – stuff like batteries
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/hecate-energy-acton-mike-garcia" target="_self"><u>sited
in wildfire risk areas</u></a> and solar farms
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight/spotlight/center-biological-diversity-tortoise-solar" target="_self"><u>in
imperiled tortoise habitat</u></a>. But in this case, I watched the
entire presentation online and left thinking this was essentially a
non-issue.
</p>
<p>
Yet Paterson says she was unconvinced by the presentation. The projects
they’re citing aren’t comparable, she claims. And then she has a laundry
list of other complaints about the potential cables.
</p>
<p>
Hearing her talk about the transmission, you’d think she just doesn’t
want this built under any circumstances. So I asked her if, given her
allies, the goal is to stop offshore wind. An avid wildlife painter, she
says no, and that she’s “very strongly in support of alternative
energy.”
</p>
<p>
Well, okay. Maybe it’s political or partisan then? I asked her who she’s
voting for in this year’s presidential election. “I don’t like anyone in
the election to be quite honest,” she confessed, self-identifying simply
as a “libertarian.” She then added: “I love the idea of Robert F.
Kennedy [Jr.] revolutionizing our health-care system. That makes me very
excited.”
</p>
<h2>
Tug of war over power lines
</h2>
<p>
Last week, Heatmap published a risk index of the top 10 renewable energy
projects worth watching for potential cancellation or major blowback to
the energy transition.
</p>
<p>
We listed Atlantic Shores in the top five, primarily citing the
project’s current role as a focal point for opponents to offshore wind
up and down the Atlantic coastline. Hours after the risk index was
published, Atlantic Shores received its final approval from the Bureau
of Ocean Energy Management.
</p>
<p>
Despite that win, we’re leaving the project on the index because the
cables have to be built too – and that stands to be a more stressful
fight.
</p>
<p>
It wasn’t supposed to be hard. In 2021, New Jersey passed a law granting
the Board of Public Utilities the authority to supersede local
governments opposing easements and other permits for offshore wind
transmission cables. But that law’s permissibility under the state
constitution hasn’t been tested yet, thanks to the cancellation of
Orsted’s Ocean Wind project, which was set to be the
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-jersey-state-government-phil-murphy-climate-and-environment-utilities-b23542107c4369a1b842dae985e0e7a0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>likeliest
battleground over cables</u></a> before Atlantic Shores.
</p>
<p>
State officials are expected in the coming weeks to lay out who will
actually build the transmission infrastructure and the route it’ll take
from Sea Girt to the Larrabee substation. Between the day of that
announcement and the completion of construction, a lot can go awry.
Donald Trump could win the presidency and, as opponents of offshore wind
expect, revisit permitting decisions for projects like Atlantic Shores.
Or a Republican like Jack Ciattarelli could win the governor’s mansion,
and that person could take any number of steps to undermine the cables
like leaving the local control law undefended in state court if it’s
challenged.
</p>
<p>
All this risk to the energy transition, started by a handful of actors
with unfounded claims about magnetic fields.
</p>
<p>
I asked Atlantic Shores for comment on the opposition movement. They did
not get back to me.
</p>
<p>
However, I did hear from the New Jersey Offshore Wind Alliance, a
consortium of developers trying to build offshore wind off the state
coast. “While we are advocates of civil discourse and engagement from
communities, we urge residents to be mindful of prevalent
misinformation,” said Paulina O’Connor, executive director of the
alliance, in a statement sent to me Tuesday evening.
</p>
<p>
“By following best practices in environmental science and engineering,
such as proper siting, minimizing disruption during construction, and
adherence to all state and federal regulations, this infrastructure can
be safely and responsibly integrated into our communities and local and
regional power grids to provide resilient and reliable power to New
Jersey homes,” O’Connor continued.
</p>
<p>
I also heard from Anjuli Ramos-Busot, executive director of Sierra
Club’s New Jersey chapter, who contacted me last night after Atlantic
Shores and the offshore wind alliance brought my reporting to their
attention.
</p>
<p>
“Let us be clear, the microwave in your kitchen emits more
electromagnetic currents than cables buried deep underground covered by
insulation and concrete,” Ramos-Busot said in a statement. “This
technology is vetted, goes through rigorous permitting standards, and is
safe and responsible for both the environment and local communities.”
</p>
<p>
Candidly, I’m holding my breath on whether Sierra Club’s words will win
over these concerned shore residents.

<p class="drop-caps">
Maybe Sharpiegate wasn’t so funny after all.
</p>
<p>
You’ll recall the micro-controversy from 2019, when then-President
Donald Trump said that Hurricane Dorian was headed toward Alabama (which
it wasn’t), and officials from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration were
<a href="https://time.com/5775953/trump-dorian-alabama-sharpiegate-noaa/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pressured</u></a>
to back up Trump’s mistake. It culminated in Trump presenting a map in
the Oval Office on which someone drew a bubble atop the projected path
of the storm so it would stretch into Alabama, apparently with a
Sharpie.
</p>
<p>
At the time it was troubling but comical, a representation of how the
cult-like adoration Trump demanded would distort the work of government
in idiotic ways. Five years later, with a storm surge of misinformation
pouring over the country in response to Hurricanes Helene and Milton, it
looks more like a harbinger of things to come.
</p>
<p>
In any crisis, some measure of confusion is inevitable. Rumors spread
and misunderstandings proliferate, fed by fear and desperation. The most
extravagant varieties of misinformation are often either short-lived or
confined to a minority of the population. That has not been true,
however, when it comes to Helene, and it
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-milton-misinformation" target="_self"><u>looks
like</u></a> Milton will repeat the same pattern. This time, the
misinformation is more explicitly partisan than ever before, and it
portends a disturbing future in which every natural disaster could
become not just a challenging task of rescue and cleanup but a
simultaneous fight against falsehoods and conspiracy theories.
</p>
<p>
It’s not that disasters have never been political; presidents are often
judged by how they react (anyone over 40 knows what the phrase
“<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/hurricane-katrina-anniversary/heck-job-brownie-where-disgraced-fema-head-now-n400436" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Brownie,
you’re doing a heckuva job</u></a>” refers to), with politicians
discredited or elevated by how they performed and the opposition taking
the opportunity to criticize the administration’s competence. But Trump
has given that familiar criticism a particularly venomous cast, claiming
not just that the disaster response is falling short but that President
Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are
<em><em>intentionally</em></em> ignoring the victims because of who they
are.
</p>
<p>
Trump has focused in particular on
<a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/376982/trump-hurricane-helene-fema-lies-debunked" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>three
falsehoods</u></a>: First, that the federal government is abandoning
hurricane victims in areas where there are lots of Republican voters;
<a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2024/10/trumps-false-claim-of-stolen-disaster-relief-funds/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>second</u></a>,
that funds for recovery are unavailable because the Biden administration
gave them to undocumented immigrants (“they stole the FEMA money, just
like they stole it from a bank, so they could give it to their illegal
immigrants that they want to have vote for them this season”); and
third, that the $750 distributed immediately to survivors to enable them
to obtain food and other basics, known as Serious Needs Assistance, is
all the aid anyone will get.
</p>
<p>
It was like a bat-signal: As soon as Trump set the terms, conservative
media and influencers
<a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/right-wing-media-are-falsely-claiming-fema-spent-their-resources-migrants-instead-helping" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>swung
into action</u></a>, repeating Trump’s bogus
<a href="https://slate.com/technology/2024/10/charlie-kirk-elon-musk-hurricane-helene-fema-misinformation-x-twitter.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>claims</u></a>
to their audiences. And then things took a strange turn.
</p>
<p>
To bring a conspiracy theory into the mainstream, you need individuals
and outlets who serve as disinformation linkages, connecting the crazier
people and ideas to those with legitimacy. In this case, Representative
Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, played a key role, and
she had a message: The weather is being manipulated by a shadowy
conspiracy with powerful technologies at its disposal. “Yes they can
control the weather,” she
<a href="https://x.com/RepMTG/status/1842755981312196688" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>posted
on X</u></a> to her 3.7 million followers. “Anyone who says they don’t,
or makes fun of this, is lying to you.”
</p>
<p>
As evidence, Greene and her allies offer the fact that many people have
<em><em>proposed</em></em> geoengineering as a solution to a warming
planet, which in their eyes means it must already be taking place, and
that’s why these hurricanes came to the Southeast. And who is “They”? It
might be the government, but to many, it’s obviously the Jews.
</p>
<p>
Antisemitic conspiracy theories around the hurricanes are swirling on
the fetid sewer of right-wing hate and misinformation controlled by the
world’s richest individual. As the <em><em>Washington Post</em></em>
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/10/08/hurricane-helene-antisemitic-misinformation-x/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a>,
“The attacks, which include wild claims that Jewish officials are
conspiring to orchestrate the disasters, sabotage the recovery or even
seize victims’ property, are being fomented largely on Elon Musk’s X.”
</p>
<p>
The tide of misinformation can be partly explained by the calendar.
“What’s different about this natural disaster is the timing,” says
Danielle Lee Tomson of the Center for an Informed Public at the
University of Washington. “We’ve never had such an incredible,
devastating natural disaster within weeks of a presidential election
that has impacted two swing states,” North Carolina and Georgia. That
gives purchase to the claims that there are conspiracies afoot to change
the outcome of the election.
</p>
<p>
In 2024, it may have been inevitable that a disaster would be tied,
however implausibly, to the “one narrative to rule them all this
election cycle, which is that of non-citizen voting,” Tomson notes.
</p>
<p>
Disaster makes people search for answers that give order to chaos and
suffering. Even answers that describe a world of sinister forces can be
weirdly comforting, by assuring their adherents that they are among a
select group who understand the reality most people miss. Amidst the
chaos, you can grasp onto whatever bizarre belief you choose.
</p>
<p>
In the future, we might expect that any climate-linked disaster —
hurricanes, floods, heat waves, droughts — will become fodder for this
kind of misinformation, not just passed around from person to person but
driven from the top of the political food chain.
</p>
<p>
In effect, this is the inverse of the kind of climate misinformation
we’re more used to, which goes under the heading of “denial”: denying
that temperatures are increasing, or that carbon pollution is a problem,
or that human activity drives climate change. Since the occurrence of a
hurricane or fire or other observably extreme event can’t be denied,
this new kind of misinformation actually posits not just that the
effects of climate change are real, but that they’re
<em><em>worse</em></em> than you realize. It isn’t just that people have
lost their lives or their homes due to a disaster, but that the disaster
was engineered by sinister forces (including but not limited to the
government) to accomplish a nefarious political goal.
</p>
<p>
So yesterday’s climate denier could become tomorrow’s climate obsessive,
seeing in every disaster the hidden hand of the same global conspiracy
that is creating all the world’s problems. “Climate change is the new
covid,”
<a href="https://x.com/RepMTG/status/1843432743163834722" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a>
Congresswoman Greene; “Ask your government if the weather is manipulated
or controlled.” It’s not fake, it’s a plot, one getting worse with each
upward tick in global temperatures.
</p>
<p>
Of course, misinformation comes in a variety of forms — some
<a href="https://x.com/florida_grand/status/1843641980523557185?s=46" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>downplayed</u></a>
Milton as a way of arguing that the elites are trying to frighten you —
and even debunkings can be a path to elevated social media clout when so
much focus is on these events.
</p>
<p>
It may be, as Tomson argues, that it takes something like an impending
election to turn conspiracy theorizing around disasters up to 11. “We’ve
never seen such an opportune moment to repackage disaster for political
gain,” she told me. But the effects of climate change will only grow
more intense and dramatic, and there will be political actors looking to
turn them against their opponents — and frightened people ready to
believe the worst.

<strong>1. Nantucket County, Massachusetts</strong> – A new group –

offshore wind project, seeking to capitalize on the recent blade
breakage to sever the town of Nantucket’s good neighbor agreement with
project developer Avangrid.
</p>

Keep Nantucket Wild was started weeks ago by raw bar restaurateur Jesse
Sandole and yoga studio owner Evie O’Connor. The group already has

<strong>2. East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana</strong> – One lowkey
local election this fall may decide the future of Louisiana’s
renewables: the swing seat on the state’s Public Service Commission,
which is being vacated this year by a retiring moderate Republican.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Only 3% of Louisiana’s power generation came

</li>
<li>
State Sen. J.P. Coussan is one of the leading candidates for the opening
on the PSC. A Republican, he said at an
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO7Y_6rBiQI" target="_blank"><u>event

“losing the farmland” that could be used by the sugar business. He also
believes renewables will ultimately make up “lower than overall 10% of
the power matrix.”<br/>
</li>
<li>
There are two other candidates for the open seat: Republican former
state Sen. Julie Quinn, who is a dyed-in-the-wool conservative and
opposes renewables, and Democrat Nick Laborde, who deeply supports
renewables but has never served in public office and currently works in
human resources.

<strong>3. Logan County, Ohio </strong>– Invenergy’s Fountain Point
solar project cleared a hurdle with the Ohio Power Siting Board last
month. But the 280 megawatt proposal may face a lengthy appeals process,

as an ad hoc member of the OPSB.

Yoder, whose county is where the project is proposed, told
<a href="https://www.peakofohio.com/local-news/listen-up-commissioner-mike-yoder" target="_blank"><u>local
radio</u></a> on Monday that the project is not affected by a recent law
empowering counties against solar and wind as challenges to the project
began before the law was passed.<br/>
</li>
<li>
But discussing potential challenges to the state Supreme Court, Yoder
said he expects construction is still “well down the road.”

<li>
“I know that we got some emails from folks who were concerned we would
be voting on it and moving forward and everything happened in two or

<strong>Transmissions on transmission </strong>– The Energy Department
last week
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/gdo/national-transmission-planning-study" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">released
a must-read</a> national planning study for transmission to connect
renewables to the grid through 2040.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The takeaway? We could reduce billions of tonnes of CO2 emissions with
interregional transmission and constraining development would require
new nuclear and hydrogen energy to meet emission reduction targets,
instead of solar, wind, and batteries.<br/>
</li>
<li>
The lengthy report didn’t go into the permitting challenges at all
though and the mapping does read aspirational if you know the context.
</li>
<li>
Regardless, we hope to see you on DOE’s webinar on the study

regulations, meaning at least two Biden regulatory tailwinds for
renewables developers remains in play.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
This means those challenges will have to weave their way through the
appeals process while remaining in effect for companies.<br/>
</li>

There’s still an outstanding request for the high court to stay EPA’s

<p>
This week we chatted with Jason Kaminsky, CEO of renewables insurance
data firm kWh Analytics. Kaminsky has been laser focused on the real
risks of physical damage solar and battery projects face – and the fears
host communities feel about them. We talked about how those risks
compare to fossil fuels and whether innovation could cure this industry
ailment.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The following is an edited version of our conversation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Are fossil fuel projects more or less insurable than the
renewable projects you cover? </strong>
</p>
<p>
On the whole, renewables are more exposed to natural catastrophe risk.
You’re putting glass out onto a field that has hail or fire or what have
you, and you see more exposure to natural events than you would [even] a
spinning turbine that’s surrounded by steel. When we were getting to
insuring property, the first risk that came onto our radar screen was
hail risk. The industry had shifted development into Texas for a variety
of reasons and the insurance companies at that point in time were not
recalibrating their models for the fact there’s actually quite
significant hail in Texas. And we were seeing significant losses.
</p>
<p>
It’s not uncommon to have multiple $50 million loss events in any given
year for solar projects due to hail, typically in Texas, Oklahoma.
That’s the zone of hail. And we don’t see that with a gas facility
particularly because, well, it’s in a building.
</p>
<p>
But it’s way more distributed than a single fossil fuel facility, so
even if you have a $50 million loss, that does not have an impact on the
ability of the grid to generate.
</p>
<p>
The part of the facility that is not damaged will continue to produce
power and put power onto the grid. You get many more partial loss events
versus a gas facility where the turbine goes and you basically have a
total loss. Your ability to distribute your risk is much greater with
renewables, which is a very strong pro from an insurance underwriting
perspective.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Are new technologies helping with renewables’ insurability?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
In the last few years, there’s been a lot of innovation. At RE+ you walk
among the floor of battery providers and they all have very impressive
fire management capabilities, and it’s at the forefront of how they
market their technology. You also see that with solar modules some have
said, <em><em>we’re hail resistant</em></em>. The way they’re putting
sensors onto cells, the way they’re running controls on cooling devices,
the way thermal management systems and battery management systems have
abilities to vent for heat… they’ve made a lot of improvements.
</p>
<p>
But it’s interesting – I was at an asset management conference in March
and I’d been going to that conference for 10 years, and it was the first
time I’d heard at that conference about the social license to operate.
They’re seeing these quasi-local thought leader groups that all seem to
be using the same talking points that oppose large scale solar in their
communities, and they push local regulatory rules to reduce the ability
to develop solar in their backyards. It was encouraging to see a
discussion around it and an acknowledgement that as an industry we need
to go into these communities and spend time talking to the local
communities.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Fascinating. Do you think discussions like these are enough to
mean progress in dealing with project opposition? </strong>
</p>
<p>
It’s not historically been in the DNA of our industry to do that. I’d
say today the opposition is much more organized than many renewable
energy developers today so it’s been this interesting phenomenon. The
local opposition says <em><em>we don’t want this industrial
solar</em></em>. It’s proven to be effective at killing some of these
utility scale deals.
</p>
<p>
We still have a long way to go in educating communities and getting them
comfortable with the land stewardship that happens at these facilities.
The solar industry manages a ton of land. It’s not my core focus but
I’ve been exposed to those challenges around the community engagement
piece and I think most developers are still building the muscle in how
to do that effectively.

an anticyclone large enough to swallow Earth, for at least 150 years.
But there are always new surprises – especially when NASA’s Hubble Space
Telescope takes a close-up look at it. Hubble’s new observations of the
famous red storm, collected 90 days between December 2023 to […]</p>

<h2 id="kde-plasma-6.2-released">KDE Plasma 6.2 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Entirely coincidentally, the KDE team released Plasma 6.2 yesterday,
the latest release in the well-received 6.x series. As the version
number implies, it’s not a groundbreaking release, but it does contain a
number of improvements that are very welcome to a few specific, often
underserved groups. For instance, 6.2 overhauls the Accessibility
settings panel, and ads, among other things, colourblindness filters for
a variety of types of colourblindness. This condition affects roughly
8-9% of the population, so it’s an important new feature. Another group
of people served by Plasma 6.2 are artists. Plasma 6.2 includes a
smorgasbord of new features for users of drawing tablets. Open System
Settings and look for Drawing Tablet to see various tools for
configuring drawing tablets. New in Plasma 6.2: a tablet calibration
wizard and test mode; a feature to define the area of the screen that
your tablet covers (the whole screen or a section); and the option to
re-bind pen buttons to different kinds of mouse clicks. ↫ KDE Plasma 6.2
release announcement Artists and regular users alike can now also enjoy
better colour management, more complete HDR support, a tone-mapping
feature in Kwin, and much more. Power management has been improved as
well, so you can now manage brightness per individual monitor, control
which application block going to sleep, and so on. There’s also the
usual array of bug fixes, UI tweaks, and so on. Plasma 6.2 is already
available in at least Fedora and openSUSE, and it will find its way to
your distribution soon enough, too.</p>

<h2 id="zavala-3.0">Zavala 3.0</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: Maurice Parker</p>
<h2 id="it-s-live">
It’s Live!
</h2>
<p>
Zavala 3.0 is now live in the App Stores. There are only a couple of new
major features in Zavala 3.0, but I put a lot of under the hood for this
release. Lots of code was changed to modernize the code base and support
new operating system features. For example, Zavala will support the
Apple Intelligence Writing Tools when they become available in macOS
15.1 and iOS/iPadOS 18.1 (assuming you have a supported device).
</p>
<p>
The biggest change was adopting Swift Structured Concurrency. This
should not be noticeable to the average user except that there should be
fewer unexplained crashes happening now. The crashes themselves are
rare, but I want using Zavala to be as good as it can be.
</p>
<p>
The new Group and Sort commands are nice to have, new features. As usual
there were a handful of bug fixes too.
</p>
<h2 id="what-s-next">
What’s next?
</h2>
<p>
I’m honestly not sure what I should, if anything enhance next. I started
out to build a good, simple outliner and I think that is what Zavala is
now. One of the reasons that I wanted Zavala to be free and open source
is so that I didn’t have to have a constant upgrade cycle to drive
revenue. Basically, I didn’t want to add features I didn’t believe in
just to make a living. That could lead to Zavala suffering from feature
bloat. I’ve seen enough applications fall into that trap.
</p>
<p>
This doesn’t mean that Zavala is abandoned or not being maintained. I
still plan on fixing bugs and taking feature requests seriously. Stuff
that fits well in Zavala and doesn’t over complicate it will be added in
minor releases, the same way that it was in the 2.x series. Apple
evolves their platforms at an astonishing rate and developers have to
modify their apps to keep up with it. I’ll stay on top of things, like
Apple Intelligence, so that Zavala doesn’t get left behind and look or
feel dated.
</p>
<p>
As always, if you find a bug or have an enhancement request, drop me an
email. Heck, email me just to say, Hi. Since I don’t collect any user
data, this is the only way I know that anyone is even using Zavala.

id="las-vegas-says-goodbye-to-tropicana-with-flashy-casino-implosion">Las
Vegas says goodbye to Tropicana with flashy casino implosion</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LAS VEGAS — Sin City blew a kiss goodbye to the Tropicana before
first light Wednesday in an elaborate implosion that reduced to rubble
the last true mob building on the Las Vegas Strip. </p>
<p>The Tropicana’s hotel towers tumbled in a celebration that included a
fireworks display. It was the first implosion in nearly a decade for a
city that loves fresh starts and that has made casino implosions as much
a part of its identity as gambling itself. </p>
<p>“What Las Vegas has done, in classic Las Vegas style, they’ve turned
many of these implosions into spectacles,” said Geoff Schumacher,
historian and vice president of exhibits and programs at the Mob
Museum. </p>
<p>Former casino mogul Steve Wynn changed the way Las Vegas blows up
casinos in 1993 with the implosion of the Dunes to make room for the
Bellagio. Wynn thought not only to televise the event but created a
fantastical story for the implosion that made it look like pirate ships
at his other casino across the street were firing at the Dunes. </p>
<p>From then on, Schumacher said, there was a sense in Las Vegas that
destruction at that magnitude was worth witnessing. </p>
<p>The city hasn’t blown up a Strip casino since 2016, when the final
tower of the Riviera was leveled for a convention center expansion. </p>
<p>This time, the implosion cleared land for a $1.5 billion baseball
stadium for the relocating Oakland Athletics, part of the city’s latest
rebrand into a sports hub. </p>
<p>That will leave only the Flamingo from the city’s mob era on the
Strip. But, Schumacher said, the Flamingo’s original structures are long
gone. The casino was completely rebuilt in the 1990s. </p>
<p>The Tropicana, the third-oldest casino on the Strip, closed in April
after welcoming guests for 67 years. </p>
<p>Once known as the “Tiffany of the Strip” for its opulence, it was a
frequent haunt of the legendary Rat Pack, while its past under the mob
has long cemented its place in Las Vegas lore. </p>
<p>It opened in 1957 with three stories and 300 hotel rooms split into
two wings. </p>
<p>As Las Vegas rapidly evolved in the following decades, including a
building boom of Strip megaresorts in the 1990s, the Tropicana also
underwent major changes. Two hotel towers were added in later years. In
1979, the casino’s beloved $1 million green-and-amber stained glass
ceiling was installed above the casino floor. </p>
<p>The Tropicana’s original low-rise hotel wings survived the many
renovations, however, making it the last true mob structure on the
Strip. </p>
<p>Behind the scenes of the casino’s grand opening, the Tropicana had
ties to organized crime, largely through reputed mobster Frank
Costello. </p>
<p>Costello was shot in the head in New York weeks after the Tropicana’s
debut. He survived, but the investigation led police to a piece of paper
in his coat pocket with the Tropicana’s exact earnings figure, revealing
the mob’s stake in the casino. </p>
<p>By the 1970s, federal authorities investigating mobsters in Kansas
City charged more than a dozen operatives with conspiring to skim $2
million in gambling revenue from Las Vegas casinos, including the
Tropicana. Charges connected to the Tropicana alone resulted in five
convictions. </p>
<p>There were no public viewing areas for the event, but fans of the
Tropicana did have a chance in April to bid farewell to the vintage
Vegas relic. </p>
<p>“Old Vegas, it’s going,” Joe Zappulla, a teary-eyed New Jersey
resident, said at the time as he exited the casino, shortly before the
locks went on the doors.</p>

<h2 id="hurricane-milton-crashes-into-tampas-development-boom">Hurricane
Milton Crashes Into Tampa’s Development Boom</h2>

<p class="drop-caps">
In around 12 hours, Hurricane Milton is set to make landfall within
miles of Tampa Bay, a region that is home to
<a href="https://stateoftheregion.com/our-region/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
than 5 million</u></a> people. Once a sleepy retirement community, the
area has seen a major development boom in recent years fueled by
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tampa-why-gen-z-and-millennial-tourists-are-flocking-to-this-retirement-mecca-1e2be027" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Millennials
and Gen Zers</u></a> seeking the perks of coastal living; it was
<a href="https://www.axios.com/local/tampa-bay/2024/05/28/fastest-growing-cities-florida-america" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
11th fastest-growing city</u></a> of its size in the U.S. as of this
spring and has been expected to continue to grow at nearly twice the
rate of the rest of the country over the next five years. A
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/climate-environment/tampa-florida-hurricane-milton-vulnerabilities-2febd205" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>third</u></a>
of those residents, including many of the newcomers, live in low-lying
neighborhoods now under urgent evacuation notices due to the threat of
“unsurvivable” storm surge, which could rise up to 15 feet.
</p>
<p>
The development boom that has made Tampa Bay so desirable is also why
it’s particularly vulnerable. In an analysis of Hurricane Ian — the most
expensive storm in Florida’s history, which struck just south of
Milton’s projected track in 2022 — the re-insurance company Swiss Re
<a href="https://www.tampabay.com/hurricane/2023/09/29/florida-home-storm-damage-building-codes-population-boom/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>found</u></a>
that if the storm had struck in the 1970s, it would have caused a third
to a half as much damage. Simply put: You can’t adapt your way out of a
hurricane problem.
</p>
<p>
If there is anyone to talk to about the vulnerabilities unique to Tampa
Bay, it’s Stephen M. Strader, an associate professor and hazard
geographer at Villanova University. Our conversation has been edited and
condensed for clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>You shared
</strong><a href="https://x.com/StephenMStrader/status/1843282278996398432" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>an
image on Twitter</strong></u></a><strong> of the explosive growth in the
Tampa Bay area between 1940 and 2024. Why does this make the region
vulnerable to a storm like Milton? Is it just about there being more
people there?</strong>
</p>
<p>
When we think about disasters, we think of the intersection of three
components: a violent event, like what we have with Milton;
vulnerability, or what types of people could be in the path, which could
be related to racial divides, age, and gender norms; and what a lot of
my work focuses on, exposure.
</p>
<p>
Exposure is just the number of people or things that we care about —
businesses, schools, and things like that — that are subject to losses
if an event occurs. Florida is a great example of rapid urbanization
since the 1900s, and it’s rapid development in a very hazard-prone
region.
</p>
<p>
<strong>It can be easy for outsiders to sit back and wonder why anyone
would buy a house on the water or on a barrier island near
Tampa.</strong>
</p>
<p>
There are a lot of factors that come into play when you think about
where we develop and why we develop certain locations. One of the
biggest pressures that we see is that it’s desirable land: In the short
term, people want to live near the water. It’s beautiful! People don’t
think necessarily about the risk that comes with it because they’re too
focused on their dream, which is to live near the ocean.
</p>
<p>
The other side of that is, from an economic standpoint, people see it as
an opportunity to have businesses and to build condos. Developers see
the land and think, “How much could I buy this for and sell it for with
homes on it?” This really started back with Carl Fisher, who was famous
for building the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. He was a thrill-seeker,
but also a businessman and developer, and he loved to go to South
Florida — which is now Miami Beach, and then was swamps and mangroves
and not developed at all. And he thought, <em><em>Hmm, this would be a
great place for people to visit for vacations and experiences.
</em></em>He slowly started filling in the wetlands with sand. And
that’s the history of Florida’s development: It continued because this
was very valuable land.
</p>
<p>
There is a lot of socioeconomic pressure to develop in these areas, but
we’re also starting to see it change. Those pressures are lessening
because you have insurance industries now and events like this year
after year.
</p>
<p>
<strong>There is another issue in Southwest Florida, which is that many
of the homes were constructed before building codes were
</strong><a href="https://x.com/MarkCBove/status/1843396247039950940" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>updated</strong></u></a><strong>,
right?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I tend to do a lot more work on the manufactured housing side. Before
1974, all manufactured homes were called mobile homes, and there wasn’t
really a standard. Then, in 1974, the United States Department of
Housing and Urban Development came in and said, “We need to increase the
standards,” and they did.
</p>
<p>
Fast-forward to 1992 and Hurricane Andrew, and they realized these codes
were not strong enough. Many people lived in manufactured homes that
were destroyed by Andrew, which was a very windy hurricane. We think
hurricanes are wind threats because of Andrew, but hurricanes are water
threats, and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/noaa-hurricane-forecast-2024#:~:text=90%25%20of%20hurricane%20fatalities%20result%20from%20water" target="_self"><u>most
deaths occur because of that water</u></a>. Andrew was the opposite.
</p>
<p>
Between 1992 and 1994, they updated building codes for manufactured
housing, and actually, along the coastline, Florida has some of the
strongest codes for manufactured homes in the country. A lot of the
areas that will be affected by Milton will have those strong standards.
But many homes were also grandfathered in if they were built before that
time.
</p>
<p>
That’s just one type of housing. My guess is that when you have a lot of
rapid development since the 1990s — well, I have some questions about
structural integrity since building codes can be strong but they might
not be followed. And we sometimes don’t know until afterwards. A lot of
what is being built are condos or McMansions — it’s basically,
<em><em>How fast can you build them, how cheap can you build them, and
how high can you sell them? </em></em>And they look great until their
performance is put into question.
</p>
<p>
Insurance companies are starting to see this and ask, “How do we
retrofit structures?” Structure-wise, though, I think Tampa is in a
decent spot. The problem is, the water is so powerful that it’s not
going to matter.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What kinds of conversations do you think Floridians should be
having about development or potential redevelopment after
Milton?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I’m a huge proponent of resisting the urge to build right back — the
reason being that’s how you get repetitive losses. The hard part is,
with a lot of insurance, if you have it, you only get provisions to
build back the way you were. You don’t have the ability to improve. So
what I end up telling people is, sometimes these disasters provide an
opportunity to assess what we need to do from a planning standpoint.
This is unsustainable development, and not just because of hurricanes,
but because of rising sea levels and the stress on the environment. And
unfortunately, a lot of these developments were built on top of wetlands
and marshes and mangroves that used to protect the island areas as
natural barriers.
</p>
<p>
The hard part is that people’s emotions are very strong after disasters,
and they immediately want to return to how things were. That’s why you
see people picking up the pieces the day after a storm, sometimes even
when they’re injured. So we have to resist the urge as a group, and say,
maybe this isn’t the time to think about rebuilding here.
</p>
<p>
Many wetland restoration projects in Florida are doing that very thing:
reclaiming the environments that protected people inland. But on the
other side you have developers and builders and local economies that
rely on people coming to these areas, and that pressures people to come
right back. Then you end up with a situation of repetitive losses and
that’s why FEMA has been losing money over the years — it’s not so much
that we’re putting money toward disasters but that we’re not getting
value out of it, because it’s so much more likely for there to be
impacts because<em> </em>of that exposure growth. Look at what happened
after Helene and what’s going to happen with Milton: We’re splitting
resources between the two. But we’re doing the best with the tools we
have when there’s pressure on both sides, and considerations both
economic and safety.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Is there anything else people should know about the geography of
Tampa or the development risk there?</strong>
</p>
<p>
This storm is going to be different than other storms, and that’s
because of the direction and intensity of it. The one thing we have to
remember is that all that development — and everybody, for the most
part, who isn’t 100 years old — has not experienced a hurricane of this
magnitude in their life. That means everyone has the cognitive bias to
say, “I’ve been through hurricanes before and was fine.” That is
probably not going to be the case with this event; no one has been
through this before.
</p>
<p>
What’s worrisome to me is that the trajectory of the hurricane is
changing. A subtle shift north or south by 20 miles could mean a big
difference for the Tampa region — if you have the right side of the
hurricane push water into the Bay, it’s no different than 10 people
jumping into a hot tub. The water level goes up and forces all that
water into a smaller region, which is going to lead to more storm surge
in Tampa Bay, Clearwater, and the St. Pete area. I don’t want to call it
a “perfect storm,” but if you push all that water in there, you’re going
to flood people in a way that hurricanes they’ve been through before
never got close to. And I worry, if it goes south, about Fort Myers and
the areas that were hit hard by Hurricane Ian. So it’s multilayered.
</p>
<p>
The good news that I’ll bring up is that we’re reeling from Helene,
which means people have it in their brains about how bad this can be,
which is probably causing more people to evacuate than normal. We have a
problem with disaster amnesia in places where a hurricane hasn’t
happened in a long time so “it’s not going to happen again.” And we
forget. I remember Hurricane Katrina and what it did to New Orleans. It
still has effects, but the students I’m teaching now weren’t even alive
when it hit. These memories are short, and many people in Florida today
weren’t there 30 years ago or 20 years ago. The only good thing to come
out of Helene is that people are now aware of what can happen.

id="republicans-democrats-work-to-preempt-fraud-claims-ahead-of-election">Republicans,
Democrats work to preempt fraud claims ahead of election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ANN ARBOR, FLINT AND DETROIT, MICHIGAN — U.S. election officials in
battleground states are pushing back against disinformation about
election integrity and working to assure Americans that their votes will
be counted.</p>
<p>Officials from both major parties in six states — Arizona, Georgia,
Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — met in Ann Arbor,
Michigan, last month for panel discussions hosted by the nonpartisan
group Keep our Republic. The group seeks to educate the American public
about threats to the U.S. election system and build trust in the
electoral system.</p>
<p>They’re working to avoid a repeat of November 2020 scenes in nearby
Detroit and other American cities where supporters of then-President
Donald Trump, riled up by his baseless accusations of election fraud,
pressured officials to stop counting the votes.</p>
<p>This year, many Trump supporters who spoke with VOA say they worry
about fraud in this election.</p>
<p>“Right now, our government, you’re going to question everything about
it,” said Marvin Minton, a Trump supporter who attended the Republican
presidential nominee’s town hall event in Flint, Michigan, in September.
“I wish I could say differently, but that’s not how America feels. We
don’t trust nobody.”</p>
<p>Angelina Kandow, who was also at the Flint event, said, “Was [the
2020 election] stolen or not? One case, one case is enough to question
the whole system.”</p>
<p>Some Trump supporters quoted alleged instances of 2020 election fraud
that were disproven during court cases triggered by the more than 60
lawsuits filed by Republicans and the Trump campaign after that year’s
election.</p>
<p>Disinformation around election integrity has gained traction among
Republicans, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public
Affairs Research and USAFacts poll, released in August.</p>
<p>The poll found 67% of Republicans trust Trump and his campaign for
accurate information on the outcome of the election. Only 51% of
Republicans said they trust the government’s certification of election
results.</p>
<p>In contrast, 87% of Democrats trust government certifications, while
82% trust Vice President Kamala Harris, the party’s presidential
nominee, and her campaign.</p>
<p>Dangerous disinformation</p>
<p>Officials in battleground states say disinformation can be
dangerous.</p>
<p>“They can in some cases lead to people making threats to election
officials or worse, based on lies or misinformation they have been told
about elections,” said Jonathan Brater, director of the Michigan Bureau
of Elections.</p>
<p>“Even if it doesn’t result in any sort of physical violence, it does
undermine trust long term in the election system, which is bad for our
republic and is bad for our democracy,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>Meagan Wolfe, an election official in Wisconsin, another battleground
state, has been targeted with intimidation, even death threats.
Republicans loyal to Trump have attempted to oust her over false claims
that she helped to rig the 2020 vote in favor of President Joe
Biden.</p>
<p>Wolfe encouraged people who don’t trust the election process to
become involved.</p>
<p>“They can become a poll worker. They can become a poll observer. They
can watch the audits of the voting equipment,” she told VOA.” All of
that is open for [the] public to view.”</p>
<p>In many states, efforts to ensure voters that elections are secure
are supported by Republicans. Justin Roebuck, a Republican election
official in Ottawa County, Michigan, acknowledges it’s an uphill
battle.</p>
<p>“Our political leaders at every level need to also seek facts and to
seek data,” he told VOA. “And I think until that happens, we will have a
problem in terms of our confidence and trust in the process.”</p>
<p>Roebuck said he is working directly with citizens, instead of through
the campaigns.</p>
<p>“We have very decentralized elections in the United States. There are
always things that we can do better,” he said. “Sometimes we have to
work through those challenges and work through those messes.”</p>
<p>Messy in Michigan</p>
<p>It’s already looking like it could become messy in Michigan.
Republicans loyal to Trump have sued Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson,
a Democrat, over absentee ballot processing guidelines and voter
registration lists.</p>
<p>“If Jocelyn Benson is not responding to what is required under the
law, we will take her to court to get the courts to compel her to do
that,” Michigan Republican Party chairperson Pete Hoekstra told VOA.</p>
<p>Benson dismissed it as a Republican strategy to create a “false sense
of irregularities in the process.”</p>
<p>“In general, we see lawsuits masquerading as a legal strategy when
they’re really a PR strategy to get misinformation or sow seeds of doubt
about our elections into the narrative,” she told VOA.</p>
<p>She said that there are “more checks and balances in place than ever
before” to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the election
process.</p>
<p>Both parties have launched election-related lawsuits in various
battleground states, which could mean chaos in the November
election.</p>
<p>“Any kind of legal challenge happening this close to an election,
typically, is lawyers putting a placeholder in case they may not win in
a state or may not have an outcome they like, and it gives them the
ability to challenge the election after the fact,” said Kim Wyman,
senior fellow with the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Elections Project in
Washington.</p>
<p>There are other potential disruptions, including efforts to delay
election certification by county officials who support Trump.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen some legal maneuvers and some boards of elections that
have changed the rules that allow more scrutiny over the canvas period
and the certification of the election,” Wyman told VOA.</p>
<p>After Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 loss culminated in the
January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters, Congress
sought to prevent such events from recurring by passing the Electoral
Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act.</p>
<p>Mandatory deadline</p>
<p>The reforms set a new mandatory December 11 deadline for states to
submit certified slates of presidential electors, provided expedited
court access to resolve challenges and raised the threshold for
objecting to election results in Congress.</p>
<p>Battleground states Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and North
Carolina have passed legislation to ensure that canvasses, recounts,
audits and legal challenges meet the new deadline.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have not, leaving their electoral systems
vulnerable to partisan lawsuits and political pressures that could force
them to miss the certification deadline.</p>
<p>This could leave uncertain the fate of 29 electoral college votes. A
presidential candidate needs at least 270 electoral college votes to
win.</p>

Is Threatening to Strike Again — This Time Over Shelved EV Plans</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mzc4ODY4OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NDIwMzg0N30.fvCBqOQxa0MZph8enStUc6Rx40I1jHHb_IA7PE3RrfE/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
One of the biggest wins the United Auto Workers’ secured in its historic
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/the-electric-vehicle-revolution-is-still-non-union" target="_blank">negotiations
with the Big Three automakers</a> last year was a commitment from
Stellantis to reopen and expand its shuttered factory in Belvidere,
Illinois. Now the company is shelving those plans, which included
retooling the factory to produce electric vehicles and EV batteries, and
suing the union for threatening to strike in response.
</p>
<p>
The dispute illustrates a new turn in the EV transition. Whereas last
year auto workers were wary of the transition and fighting to keep their
jobs intact, now their jobs are dependent on that transition actually
happening, and happening soon. The UAW is
<a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/chrysler/2024/08/20/stellantis-uaw-belvidere-assembly-plant-strike-reopening/74869725007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>concerned
that the company will delay the plant’s reopening</u></a> until 2028 —
after the union’s contract expires.
</p>
<p>
Stellantis idled the Belvidere plant, which previously produced Jeep
Cherokees, in February 2023, laying off more than 1,300 workers. But
under its agreement with the UAW, the company said it would spend nearly
$5 billion to restart the factory. The contract includes commitments to
opening a parts distribution hub there this year, producing a new
mid-size truck there by 2027, and building an electric vehicle battery
plant at the site by 2028. Not only would jobs at Belvidere be restored,
but the battery plant was expected to employ an additional 1,300 people.
Former Belvidere employees would also be reclassified as temporary
layoffs and receive partial pay and full healthcare benefits until
operations started up again.
</p>
<p>
President Joe Biden celebrated Belvidere as a “great comeback story” in
his
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/03/07/remarks-of-president-joe-biden-state-of-the-union-address-as-prepared-for-delivery-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>State
of the Union speech</u></a> in March. “Instead of an auto factory
shutting down, an auto factory is reopening and a new state-of-the-art
battery factory is being built to power those cars,” he said. “Instead
of a town being left behind it’s a community moving forward again!”
</p>
<p>
In July, plans to turn Belvidere into an EV hub seemed to be taking
shape when the Department of Energy selected Stellantis for a $335
million grant to transition the plant’s assembly lines to be able to
produce electric vehicles. The
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/mesc/domestic-manufacturing-conversion-grant-program" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>grant
website</u></a> says the project was anticipated to incorporate
“significant upgrades” to the plant’s infrastructure and re-employ about
“1,450 unionized and highly skilled employees.” Stellantis, however, did
not issue any press releases about the grant. In a
<a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/07/11/stellantis-grant/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>statement
to the </u><u><em><em>Chicago Tribune</em></em></u></a>, the company
said it was “an important step in continuing to work toward finalizing a
sustainable solution” for Belvidere.
</p>
<p>
About a month later, the narrative around Belvidere started to shift.
UAW president Shawn Fain
<a href="https://x.com/UAW/status/1824547479074775502" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>posted
a video</u></a> on social media claiming something was “rotten” at
Stellantis and accused the company of “putting the brakes” on its plans
to reopen the plant. On August 20,
<a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=26081&mid=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Stellantis
confirmed</u></a> that “plans for Belvidere will be delayed,” though it
“firmly stands by its commitment” to reopen the plant. The company’s
explanation for the decision was vague and did not include a new
timeline. “To ensure the Company’s future competitiveness and
sustainability,” it said, “it is critical that the business case for all
investments is aligned with market conditions and our ability to
accommodate a wide range of consumer demands.”
</p>
<p>
As it stands, the business is not exactly in a sustainable place. In
July, Stellantis reported that its U.S. revenues were down 16% compared
to the first half of last year. Declining sales have left dealerships
with a glut of inventory. Fain blames the company’s poor performance on
its CEO Carlos Tavares, questioning how “market conditions” could be
holding back investments in Belvidere when Tavares took a 56% raise last
year, “making him the highest paid auto executive outside of Tesla.”
</p>
<p>
In response, the company
<a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=26271&mid=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>published
a fact check of the union’s claims,</u></a> which notes that “there is
indisputable volatility in the market, especially as the industry
transitions to an electrified future. Over the past year, numerous
companies across the industry have announced investment and product
delays as well as outright product cancellations.” Stellantis currently
sells just one EV in the U.S., the Fiat 500e, which it
<a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=25708&mid=351" target="_blank">manufactures
in Italy</a>; in September, the company announced it had suspended
production due to
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/stellantis-pauses-production-electric-fiat-500-due-poor-demand-2024-09-12/" target="_blank"><u>poor
sales</u></a>, though it still has several new EV models slated to
launch later this year.
</p>
<p>
More than a dozen local UAW units all over the country filed grievances
against Stellantis in August, arguing that the company’s “failure to
plan for, fund and launch these programs constitute a violation” of its
contract. The union has threatened to strike if the grievances are not
addressed, citing its “right to strike over product and investment
commitments” — another provision of the 2023 contract.
</p>
<p>
Stellantis denies that it has violated the contract and thrown the
accusation back at UAW, noting that the agreement included a clause that
says it is understood that the investments are “contingent upon plant
performance, changes in market conditions, and consumer demand.” It has
since
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/stellantis-files-new-suits-against-united-auto-workers-union-2024-10-07/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>filed
eight lawsuits</u></a> against the union and several of its locals for
threatening to strike.
</p>
<p>
The company has also not completely abandoned its plans for the EV
transition. A few weeks ago, it
<a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=26153" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced</u></a>
it would invest more than $406 million to prepare three Michigan
factories for EV production. During a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urAJ4gmSqZE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>livestream</u></a>
in September, Fain wrote off those investments as representing just a
small portion of what the company committed to.
</p>
<p>
In response to questions about why investment in Belvidere was delayed,
whether the company would still pursue the federal grant, or what the
new timeline for the plant was, a representative from Stellantis sent me
bullet points from the previously published fact check.
</p>
<p>
The Department of Energy did not answer questions about the status or
timeline for the factory conversion grant.

<li>IEA: Renewable capacity growth not enough to triple by 2030
</h3>
<p>
There are several big energy reports out this week, and taken together,
their findings tell a nuanced story of an energy transition that’s well
underway, but still moving too slowly. Let’s start with the big one: The
International Energy Agency’s
<a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/88a07dd9-42fe-4232-842e-9015b4b647f8/Renewables2024.pdf?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9y2MCHCJEqAXKW73y70FjwIrf39NV9JySPV_y9YgkmYvjFXnBKe_Q1yPjeBQOdC0XUy4wb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Renewables
2024</a> report, published this morning. It says that the world is on
track to add 5,500 gigawatts of new clean energy capacity by 2030, 80%
of which will come from solar PV alone. That means renewables will
account for half of global electricity generation by the end of the
decade.

<p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<p>
While this is huge progress (the report notes that 5,500 GW is roughly
equal the power capacity of China, the European Union, India, and the
U.S. combined), it is not enough to meet the COP28 goal of tripling
renewable capacity by 2030. But! The IEA stresses that it is “entirely
possible” to meet this target if governments can get their acts
together, set bold new emission reduction targets in the coming months,
and work together to lower the energy transition costs for poorer
countries. “The market can deliver on renewables, and now governments
need to prioritize investing in storage, grids, and other forms of clean
flexibility to enable this transformation,” said Dave Jones, director of
global insights at energy think tank Ember. “The next half decade is
going to be one heck of a ride.”
</p>
<p>
So, that’s renewables. Let’s look at what all this means for emissions
and, most importantly, warming.

An energy transition

published this morning from Norwegian risk management company DNV
concludes, rather remarkably, that energy-related emissions are set to
peak this year and begin a steady decline thanks to the plummeting costs
of solar and batteries, especially in China. “Emissions peaking is a
milestone for humanity,” said Remi Eriksen, group president and CEO of
DNV. However, the projected rate of emission reduction is only enough to
limit warming to <strong>2.2 degrees Celsius </strong>by 2100. “We must
now focus on how quickly emissions decline and use the available tools
to accelerate the energy transition,” Eriksen added.
</p>
<p>
The Rhodium

Outlook 2024</a> report, out yesterday, concluded that there is a less
than 7% chance of the world limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius
“if current trends in policy and technology development continue.” In
fact, it projected a “very likely” increase between<strong> 2 degrees
Celsius</strong> and <em>gulp</em> <strong>3.7 degrees Celsius
</strong>by century’s end. However, odds of limiting warming to 2
degrees jump to 96% if all countries can get to net-zero emissions by
2070. To date, 149 countries (representing 88% of global emissions) have
made net-zero or carbon neutrality commitments, though it remains to be
seen if and when they’ll meet those goals.

The cost of “green” hydrogen – that which is produced with clean energy

published yesterday in the journal <em>Joule</em>. The fuel is seen as
key to curbing emissions from hard-to-abate sectors (industry, for
example), and many are banking on the price of production falling. But
the researchers say the high storage and distribution costs are often
overlooked. Taking those costs into consideration, carbon capture and
storage is cheaper than green hydrogen when it comes to curbing
emissions, the researchers found. “Even if production costs decrease in
line with predictions, storage and distribution costs will prevent
hydrogen being cost-competitive in many sectors,”

Climate change made deadly Hurricane Helene more intense</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Hurricane Helene’s torrential rain and powerful winds
were made about 10% more intense due to climate change, according to a
study published Wednesday by the World Weather Attribution (WWA)
group.  </p>
<p>Although a 10% increase “might seem relatively small… that small
change in the hazard really leads to big change in impacts and damage,”
said climate scientist Friederike Otto, who heads the research
organization.  </p>
<p>The study also found that fossil fuels — the primary cause of climate
change — have made hurricanes like Helene 2.5 times more likely to
occur.  </p>
<p>In other words, storms of Helene’s magnitude were formerly
anticipated once every 130 years, but now the probability is closer to
once every 53 years, on average.  </p>
<p>To conduct the study, researchers focused on three aspects of
Hurricane Helene: precipitation, winds and the water temperature of the
Gulf of Mexico — a key factor in its formation.  </p>
<p>“All aspects of this event were amplified by climate change to
different degrees,” Ben Clarke, a co-author of the study and researcher
at Imperial College London, told a press conference.  </p>
<p>“And we’ll see more of the same as the world continues to warm,” he
continued.  </p>

meteorologists who study the role of climate change in extreme weather
events, comes as the southeastern US state of Florida prepares for the
arrival of another major hurricane, Milton, just 10 days after it was
hit by Helene.   </p>
<p>Destruction</p>
<p>Helene made landfall in northwestern Florida on September 26 as a
Category 4 hurricane with winds up to 140 mph (225 kph).  </p>
<p>The storm then moved north, causing heavy rain and devastating floods
in several states, including North Carolina, where it claimed the
highest death toll.  </p>
<p>The authors of the study emphasized that the risk posed by hurricanes
has increased in scope beyond coastal areas.  </p>
<p>Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at NGO Climate Central,
said Helene “had so much intensity” that it would take time for it to
lose strength, but the “storm was moving fast… so it could go farther
inland pretty quickly.”  </p>
<p>This study utilized three methodologies to examine the three aspects
of the storm, and was conducted by researchers from the US, the UK,
Sweden and the Netherlands.  </p>
<p>To study its rainfall, researchers used an approach based on both
observation and climate models, depending on the two regions involved:
one for coastal areas like Florida, and another for inland areas like
the Appalachian mountains.  </p>
<p>In both cases, the study found precipitation had increased by 10
percent because of global warming, which is currently at 1.3 degrees
Celsius above pre-industrial levels.  </p>
<p>To study Helene’s winds, scientists looked at hurricane data dating
back as far as 1900.  </p>
<p>They determined Helene’s winds were 11 percent stronger, or 13 mph
(21 kph), as a result of climate change.  </p>
<p>Lastly, the researchers examined the water temperature in the Gulf of
Mexico, where Helene formed, finding it was around 2 degrees Celsius
above normal.  </p>
<p>This record temperature was made 200 to 500 times more likely due to
climate change, the study asserts.  </p>
<p>Warmer oceans release more water vapor, providing more energy for
storms as they form.  </p>
<p>“If humans continue to burn fossil fuels, the US will face even more
destructive hurricanes,” Clarke warned in a statement.</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
<em>From the BBC World Service:</em> The U.S. Department of Justice is
taking aim at Google, saying the tech giant might need to be broken up
because it’s too dominant in the market. This comes after a major ruling
in August where a judge found Google has been running an illegal
monopoly when it comes to online searches. Plus, an agency enabling the
international mail system celebrates its 150th birthday.

<h2 id="us-urges-peaceful-resolution-of-any-taiwan-disputes">US urges
peaceful resolution of any Taiwan disputes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A top U.S. official said the United States expects
differences across the Taiwan Strait to be resolved peacefully and
opposes any unilateral changes to the status quo as Taiwan prepares to
celebrate the founding of the Republic of China on Thursday.</p>
<p>The People’s Republic of China, or PRC, celebrates its national day
on October 1, marking the founding of the country in 1949. Taiwan
chooses October 10, known as Double Ten Day, to celebrate the founding
of the ROC in 1912, just months after an uprising that began on October
10, 1911.</p>
<p>The PRC typically closely monitors speeches from Taiwan’s leaders
during Double Ten Day celebrations. Since Taiwan’s democratically
elected President Lai Ching-te took office in May, Beijing has increased
military pressure on Taiwan, deeming Lai a “separatist.”</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific
Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink said that the U.S.’s “fundamental interest is
in the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,”
reiterating that Washington’s longstanding One China policy remains
unchanged, “guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three Joint
Communiques and the Six Assurances.”</p>
<p>“We oppose unilateral changes to the status quo by either side. We do
not support Taiwan independence, and we expect cross-strait differences
to be resolved peacefully,” Kritenbrink told VOA during a briefing.</p>
<p>Speaking at an event Saturday, Lai noted that the PRC celebrated its
75th anniversary on October 1, and in a few days, it would be the ROC’s
113th birthday.</p>
<p>“In terms of age, it is absolutely impossible for the People’s
Republic of China to be considered the motherland of the people of the
Republic of China. On the contrary, the ROC may be the motherland of the
people of the PRC who are over 75 years old,” Lai told an audience in
Taipei.</p>
<p>PRC officials have remained largely muted on Lai’s remarks, but some
analysts say that could be because Beijing is preparing to launch
another round of military exercises after Lai delivers his Double Ten
Day speech.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have referred inquiries to “President Lai’s office for
any commentary on his specific comments.”</p>
<p>European visit</p>
<p>Meanwhile, former Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen will visit the
Czech Republic this month, a visit seen as sensitive since Beijing has
repeatedly denounced the democratic leader as a “separatist.”</p>
<p>In Beijing on Tuesday, a spokesperson from the PRC’s Ministry of
Foreign Affairs was asked to comment on Tsai’s planned visit to
Prague.</p>
<p>“We firmly oppose anyone who seeks “Taiwan independence” visiting
countries with diplomatic ties with China under any pretext. We urge the
Czech Republic and relevant countries to earnestly abide by the One
China principle and respect China’s sovereignty and territorial
integrity,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told
reporters Tuesday.</p>
<p>Taiwan has been self-ruled since 1949, when Mao Zedong’s communists
took power in Beijing after defeating Chiang Kai-shek’s Kuomintang
nationalists in a civil war, prompting the nationalists’ relocation to
the island.</p>
<p>The U.S. does not maintain an official relationship with Taiwan but
provides defense equipment to the self-ruled democracy under the Taiwan
Relations Act.</p>
<p>Treaty of Aigun</p>
<p>In a TV interview in September, Lai remarked that if China’s claims
over Taiwan are genuinely rooted in concerns about territorial
integrity, it should also seek to reclaim the land it ceded to Russia in
the 19th century.</p>
<p>He referenced the 1858 Treaty of Aigun, through which China, under
the Qing dynasty, gave up a vast area of land — now part of Russia’s Far
East — to the Russian Empire, establishing much of the modern border
along the Amur River.</p>
<p>The Treaty of Aigun, along with the 1860 Convention of Peking, saw
China relinquish 600,000 square kilometers — an area almost the size of
Ukraine — to the Russian Empire, enabling Russia to establish a naval
base at Vladivostok. Many Chinese people still brood over this period of
history, harboring lingering resentment over the fact that the land once
belonged to China before being annexed by Russia.</p>
<p>In 2023, China’s Ministry of Natural Resources mandated that new maps
use Chinese names for Vladivostok — Haishenwai — as well as several
other cities in the region.</p>

How can you fight climate change in your daily life? Last month, Heatmap
published our attempt at answering that question: Called Decarbonize
Your Life, it’s a series of stories and guides to help you make better,
smarter decisions to nudge the energy system away from fossil fuels. We
consulted studies, ran our own analysis (with a little help from some
friends), and used our expert judgment to arrive at six big,
high-leverage actions you can take to fight climate change and cut
carbon pollution.
</p>
<p>
On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Jesse and Rob speak with Heatmap’s
deputy editor Jillian Goodman and founding staff writer Emily Pontecorvo
about what those six big actions are, how the guide came together, and
why big choices matter so much more than small ones. Shift Key is hosted
by Robinson Meyer, the founding executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse
Jenkins, a professor of energy systems engineering at Princeton
University.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>So it’s more than just the carbon impact
which is the key here, right? This systemic leverage point that you’re
trying to make is that you’re trying to think about — beyond just
reducing emissions, which is important — how is that actually having
some kind of systemic impact on reorienting the global capitalist
system, right? That we all live in, towards where we want to go, towards
what a net zero emissions lifestyle and society looks like.<br/> <br/>
<strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>And instead of every dollar you spend
going to the task of taking oil out of the ground, and the task of
building more internal combustion cars, it’s going to the task of
building more EVs and harvesting electricity. Anyway, Jillian, I
interrupted you.<br/> <br/> <strong>Jillian Goodman: </strong>I was just
going to add — and again, I’m just paraphrasing you — every time you
drive, it’s a marginal impact. Every single time you use the device. Not
only are you emitting less in the short term, you’re emitting less in
the long term. And as the grid gets cleaner, every time you drive your
EV, your EV will get cleaner, as well.<br/> <br/> <strong>Emily
Pontecorvo:</strong> One other thing that we were thinking about a
little bit is thinking about these actions in terms of, which ones are
you, as an individual, you’re literally the one who’s burning the fossil
fuels. When you drive your car, you are burning the gas. When you’re
lighting your stove, you’re burning natural gas. And not to put it all
on the individual, but you’re the one who has the power to say,
<em><em>Okay, I’m not gonna burn fossil fuels in my home
anymore.</em></em> And whereas with a few other actions — like with
rooftop solar, with efficiency improvements — those are extremely
important, and those are very high on our list for other reasons. But
they’re more indirect.

<h2 id="us-considers-breakup-of-google-in-landmark-search-case">US
considers breakup of Google in landmark search case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — The U.S. said on Tuesday it may ask a judge to force
Alphabet’s Google to divest parts of its business, such as its Chrome
browser and Android operating system, that it says are used to maintain
an illegal monopoly in online search.</p>
<p>In a landmark case, a judge in August found that Google, which
processes 90% of U.S. internet searches, had built an illegal monopoly.
The Justice Department’s proposed remedies have the potential to reshape
how Americans find information on the internet while shrinking Google’s
revenues and giving its competitors more room to grow.</p>
<p>“Fully remedying these harms requires not only ending Google’s
control of distribution today, but also ensuring Google cannot control
the distribution of tomorrow,” the Justice Department said.</p>
<p>The proposed fixes will also aim to keep Google’s past dominance from
extending to the burgeoning business of artificial intelligence,
prosecutors said.</p>
<p>The Justice Department might also ask the court to end Google’s
payments to have its search engine pre-installed or set as the default
on new devices.</p>
<p>Google has made annual payments - $26.3 billion in 2021 - to
companies including Apple and other device manufacturers to ensure that
its search engine remained the default on smartphones and browsers,
keeping its market share strong.</p>
<p>Google, which plans to appeal, said in a corporate blog post that the
proposals were “radical” and said they “go far beyond the specific legal
issues in this case.”</p>
<p>Google maintains that its search engine has won users with its
quality, adding that it faces robust competition from Amazon and other
sites, and that users can choose other search engines as their
default.</p>
<p>The world’s fourth-largest company with a market capitalization of
over $2 trillion, Alphabet is under mounting legal pressure from
competitors and antitrust authorities.</p>
<p>A U.S. judge ruled on Monday in a separate case, that Google must
open up its lucrative app store, Play, to greater competition, including
making Android apps available from rival sources. Google is also
fighting a Justice Department case that seeks the breakup of its web
advertising business.</p>
<p>As part of its efforts to prevent Google’s dominance from extending
into AI, the Justice Department said it may seek to make available to
rivals the indexes, data and models it uses for Google search and
AI-assisted search features.</p>
<p>Other orders prosecutors may seek include restricting Google from
entering agreements that limit other AI competitors’ access to web
content and letting websites opt out of Google using their content to
train AI models.</p>
<p>Google said the AI-related proposals could stifle the sector.</p>
<p>“There are enormous risks to the government putting its thumb on the
scale of this vital industry — skewing investment, distorting
incentives, hobbling emerging business models — all at precisely the
moment that we need to encourage investment,” Google said.</p>
<p>The Justice Department is expected to file a more detailed proposal
with the court by Nov. 20. Google will have a chance to propose its own
remedies by Dec. 20.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta’s ruling in Washington was a major win
for antitrust enforcers who have brought an ambitious set of cases
against Big Tech companies over the past four years.</p>
<p>The U.S. has also sued Meta Platforms, Amazon.com and Apple claiming
they illegally maintain monopolies.</p>
<p>Some of the ideas in the Justice Department’s proposals to break up
Google had previously garnered support from Google’s smaller competitors
such as reviews site Yelp and rival search engine company
DuckDuckGo.</p>
<p>Yelp, which sued Google over search in August, says spinning off
Google’s Chrome browser and AI services should be on the table. Yelp
also wants Google to be prohibited from giving preference to Google’s
local business pages in search results.</p>

id="grazer-beats-the-behemoth-that-killed-her-cub-to-win-alaskas-fat-bear-contest">Grazer
beats the behemoth that killed her cub to win Alaska’s Fat Bear
Contest</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ANCHORAGE, Alaska — In a storyline better befitting a melodrama than
a popularity vote, Grazer won her second Fat Bear Contest Tuesday by
defeating the male behemoth that killed her cub this summer.</p>
<p>Grazer beat Chunk by more than 40,000 votes cast by fans watching
live cameras at explore.org of Alaska’s Katmai National Park and
Preserve.</p>
<p>Fans cast votes online for their favorite chunky competitor in
tournament-style brackets that begins with 12 bears. They picked the
bear they believe best exemplifies winter preparedness by the fat they
have accumulated over the summer feeding on the sockeye salmon that
return to Brooks River.</p>
<p>The bears often perch at the top of a falls in the river, grabbing
leaping salmon out of the air as the fish attempt to hurdle the
waterfall to spawn upstream.</p>
<p>This is where Grazer’s cub died after it slipped over the waterfall
and was killed by Chunk, perhaps the most dominant brown bear on the
river. Grazer fought Chunk in an effort to save the cub, but it later
died. The death was captured on the live cameras.</p>
<p>Another death was captured live by the cameras just last week,
delaying the release of the tournament bracket for a day. Bear 402, a
female bear that was supposed to be a contestant in this year’s contest,
was killed by a male brown bear the day the brackets were expected to be
released.</p>
<p>Grazer has conspicuously blond ears and a long, straight muzzle,
according to her bio page at explore.org.</p>
<p>“She is a formidable presence on Brooks River. Her fearlessness and
strength have earned her respect, with most bears avoiding
confrontation,” it says.</p>
<p>Her other surviving cub from her third litter placed second two weeks
ago in the Fat Bear Junior contest.</p>
<p>Chunk is perhaps the largest bear on the river, with narrow-set eyes,
dark brown fur and a distinctive scar across his muzzle, his bio says.
He used his size to rise to the top of the river hierarchy this year and
secured the prime fishing spots.</p>
<p>“Chunk’s confidence and aggression paid off, allowing him to feast on
42 salmon in 10 hours,” it says. “His physical success is evident in his
bulky form.”</p>
<p>Adult male brown bears typically weigh 270 to 410 kilograms in
mid-summer. By the time they are ready to hibernate after feasting on
migrating and spawning salmon — each eats as many as 30 fish per day —
large males can weigh well over 454 kilograms. Females are about
one-third smaller.</p>
<p>The annual contest, which drew more than 1.3 million votes last year,
is a way to celebrate the resiliency of the 2,200 brown bears that live
in the preserve on the Alaska Peninsula, which extends from the state’s
southwest corner toward the Aleutian Islands.</p>
<p>In addition to the live cameras, Katmai has become a bucket list
tourist destination and viewing stands have been built on the river to

<p>Wisconsin, a Midwestern U.S. state known for its dairy farms and beer
production, has emerged as a crucial battleground in the 2024
presidential election. With a history of extremely close races,
Wisconsin’s 10 electoral votes could determine who becomes the next
president. The state’s unique mix of urban and rural voters, along with
key issues like the economy and abortion rights, make it a microcosm of
the nation’s political divide.</p>

Climate Change Is Supercharging Hurricane Milton</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-09, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mzc2ODk2MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MjkxMTQ0NH0.wZoQdZ5RRi34C-oAW-_F_mWtSvSqHSUx_sHGs7Ouc5U/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
Contrary to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-milton-misinformation" target="_self"><u>recent
rumor</u></a>, the U.S. government cannot direct major hurricanes like
Helene and Milton toward red states. According to two new rapid
attribution studies by World Weather Attribution and
<a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/hurricane-rapid-intensification?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Climate%20Shift%20Index%20Alert%20-%20Hurricane%20Milton%20Oct%207%202024&utm_content=Climate%20Shift%20Index%20Alert%20-%20Hurricane%20Milton%20Oct%207%202024+CID_5a4c73076a532c0cb91ebd2b7e99e07f&utm_source=Climate%20Central%20Email%20Campaign%20Monitor&utm_term=extreme%20rapid%20intensification" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Climate
Central</u></a>, however, human actors almost certainly made the storms
a lot worse through the burning of fossil fuels.
</p>
<p>
A storm like Hurricane Helene, which has
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-death-study" target="_self"><u>killed
at least 227 people so far</u></a> and caused close to
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/07/business/property-damange-hurricane-helene-47-billion/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$50
billion in estimated property losses</u></a> across the southeast, is
about two-and-a-half times more likely in the region today compared to
what would be expected in a “cooler pre-industrial climate,” WWA found.
That means Helene, the kind of storm one would expect to see once every
130 years on average, is now expected to develop at a rate of about once
every 53 years. Additionally, WWA researchers determined that extreme
rainfall from Helene was 70% more likely and 10% heavier in the
Appalachians and about 40% more likely in the southern Appalachian
region, where many of the deaths occurred, due to climate change.
</p>
<p>
“Americans shouldn’t have to fear hurricanes more violent than Helene —
we have all the knowledge and technology needed to lower demand and
replace oil, gas, and coal with renewable energy,” Friederike Otto, the
lead of WWA and a senior lecturer in climate science at Imperial College
London, said in a statement. “But vitally, we need the political will.”
Alarmingly, the attribution study found that storms could drop an
additional 10% or more rain on average as soon as the 2050s if warming
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/year-warming-paris-agreement" target="_self"><u>reaches</u></a>
2 degrees Celsius.
</p>
<p>
WWA’s study is
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/helene-rainfall-boosted-human-driven-climate-change-studies-find-rcna173608" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not
the first</a> to be released on Hurricane Helene, but it was still
produced incredibly quickly and has not been peer reviewed. Just a few
weeks ago, the group issued a correction on a report estimating the
contribution of climate change to recent
<a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/climate-change-and-high-exposure-increased-costs-and-disruption-to-lives-and-livelihoods-from-flooding-associated-with-exceptionally-heavy-rainfall-in-central-europe/" target="_blank">flooding
in Europe</a>.
</p>
<p>
Separately, Climate Central looked at Hurricane Milton, which already
has the distinction of being
<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/hurricane-milton-category-5-storm-fifth-strongest-ever-atlantic-1965604" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
fifth strongest</u></a> Atlantic storm on record. The nonprofit’s
findings show that Milton’s rapid intensification — one of
<a href="https://theconversation.com/hurricane-milton-explodes-into-a-powerful-category-5-storm-as-it-heads-for-florida-heres-how-rapid-intensification-works-240754" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
fastest and most powerful</u></a> instances of the phenomenon in history
— is primarily due to high
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-season-2024" target="_self"><u>sea
surface temperatures</u></a> in the weeks before Milton developed, which
was made at least 400 times more likely by climate change and up to 800
times more likely. (WWA relied on Climate Central’s Climate Shift Index
for oceans for its research, but found “climate change made the
unusually hot sea surface temperature about 200-500 times more likely.”)
</p>
<p>
Attribution science is incredibly tricky, especially for a storm system
like a hurricane that has variables ranging from wind shear to the El
Niño–Southern Oscillation to ocean temperatures and jet stream
variations. When
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/is-extreme-weather-climate-change" target="_self"><u>I
spoke to a member of the WWA team earlier this year</u></a>, I was told
the organization specifically avoids attributing the intensification of
any <em><em>individual</em></em> hurricane — in theory, one of the more
straightforward relationships — to climate change because of the
relatively limited historical modeling available. Even something like
rainfall “is not necessarily correlated to the magnitude of the floods
that you see because there are other factors,” WWA’s Clair Barnes
previously told me — for example, the steep-sided mountains and hollows
of western North Carolina, which served as funnels for rainfall to an
especially devastating effect.
</p>
<p>
But regarding the relationship between hurricanes and climate change
more generally, “We’re relatively confident that storms will get more
intense” in a warming world, Gabriel Vecchi, a Princeton geoscientist,
explained on
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-s2-hurricane-helene" target="_self"><u>a
recent episode of Heatmap’s Shift Key</u></a> podcast. “And we’re
<em><em>really </em></em>confident that storms will get wetter.”
</p>
<p>
Helene and Milton hammer that point home: once-in-a-generation storms
can now arrive on back-to-back weekends. You can almost understand the
impulse to devise a zany explanation as to why. Only, the truth is far
simpler than cloud seeding or
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-maui-fire-photos-misrepresented-conspiracy-555091357957" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>space
lasers</u></a>: a warmer atmosphere makes for warmer oceans, which make
for wetter, more intense storms. And while hurricane seasons
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/2024-hurricane-season-helene#:~:text=a%20couple%20of%20named%20storms%20in%20November%2C" target="_self"><u>eventually
end</u></a>, global temperatures
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/climate-track-warm-by-nearly-3c-without-greater-ambition-un-report-2023-11-20/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>haven’t
stopped going up</u></a>. That, perhaps, is the more terrifying subtext
of the attribution studies: There will be more Miltons and Helenes.
