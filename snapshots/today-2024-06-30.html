<h2 id="the-mimo-diaries-feedback-and-directory">The Mimo Diaries:
Feedback and Directory</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-30, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Another quick update for those who are interested on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://minimalissimo.com&quot;&gt;Minimalissimo&lt;/a&gt; side of my digital life. For those who don’t know, at the beginning of 2024 I took charge of Minimalissimo and I’m now curating it, updating it, designing and coding for it, and steering it towards its future. It’s a fun project to work on and I have a ton of ideas but also very little time. It’s a one man show and there’s a lot to do.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Today I pushed live a
<a href="https://minimalissimo.com/feedback">feedback page</a> because I
have a couple of decisions to take and I don’t want to do it blindly. So
if you are a reader of the site I’d really appreciate if you can take a
moment and share your thoughts on a few subjects. It shouldn’t take too
long, maybe 5 minutes at most.
</p>
<p>
The other thing I’ve been working on is a new directory that collects in
one place links to people and brands that are aligned with the
Minimalissimo vision. It’s something that’s incredibly useful for me to
have online because it will make the curation of the site easier and
that’s huge because curation can be very time consuming.

</div>
</figure>
<p>
The directory is ready form a technical point of view but now I need to
add content to it and that will take me some time. I have more than a
thousand links to go through and my hope is to have it live before the
end of the summer. We’ll see how it goes.

extremist groups in Africa fuel worries that they could attack the US,
allies</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>GABORONE, Botswana — Violent extremist groups linked to al-Qaida and
the Islamic State group are growing in size and influence across Africa,
fueling worries that as they improve their tactics they could attack the
U.S. or Western allies.</p>
<p>U.S. defense and military officials described the threats and their
concerns about growing instability in Africa, where a number of coups
have put ruling juntas in control, leading to the ouster of American
troops and a decline in U.S. intelligence gathering.</p>
<p>“Threats like Wagner, terrorist groups and transnational criminal
organizations continue to sow instability in multiple regions,” Air
Force Gen. CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in
opening remarks Tuesday at a conference of African chiefs of defense in
Botswana. “I think we can all agree, what happens in one part of the
world, does not stay in one part of the world.”</p>
<p>Wagner is the Russian mercenary group that has gone into African
nations to provide security as Western forces, including from the U.S.
and France, have been pushed out. The group is known for its brutality,
and human rights organizations have accused its members of raping and
killing civilians.</p>
<p>While Brown only touched briefly on the terror threat in the region,
it was a key topic among others at the conference and spurred questions
from military chiefs in the audience after his speech. They wanted to
know what the U.S. could do to help stem the spread of insurgents in
West Africa, the Gulf of Guinea and the Sahel.</p>
<p>This is the first time that the chiefs of defense conference has been
held on African soil. And it is the first time the U.S. joint chiefs
chairman has visited a sub-Saharan country since 1994, when Gen. John
Shalikashvili visited Rwanda and Zaire.</p>
<p>A senior U.S. defense official said al-Qaida linked groups — such as
al-Shabab in Somalia and Jama’a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin, known as
JNIM, in the Sahel region — are the largest and most financially viable
insurgencies. JNIM is active in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger and is
looking to expand into Benin and Togo, which it uses as hubs to rest,
recuperate, get financing and gather weapons but also has increased
attacks there.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Islamic State group has key cells in West
Africa and in the Sahel. The defense official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity to discuss a threat assessment, said the Islamic State cells
were getting increasing direction from the group’s leadership that
relocated to northern Somalia. That has included how to kidnap
Westerners for ransom, how to learn better military tactics, how to hide
from drones and how to building their own small quadcopters.</p>
<p>A U.S. military airstrike in Somalia on May 31 targeted Islamic State
militants and killed three, according to U.S. Africa Command. U.S.
officials have said the strike targeted the group’s leader, but the
defense official said Monday that it’s still unclear if he was
killed.</p>
<p>Roughly 200 Islamic State insurgents are in Somalia, so they are
vastly outnumbered by al-Shabab, which has grown in size to between
10,000 and 12,000.</p>
<p>The growth of the insurgent groups within Africa signals the belief
by both al-Qaida and the Islamic State group that the continent is a
ripe location for jihadism, where extremist ideology can take root and
expand, the official said.</p>
<p>And it comes as the U.S. was ordered to pull out its 1,000 troops
from Niger in the wake of last July’s coup and also about 75 from Chad.
Those troop cuts, which shut down a critical U.S. counterterrorism and
drone base at Agadez, hamper intelligence gathering in Niger, said
Gen. Michael Langley, head of U.S. Africa Command.</p>
<p>Surveillance operations before the coup gave the U.S. a greater
ability to get intelligence on insurgent movements. Now, he said, the
key goal is a safe and secure withdrawal of personnel and equipment from
both Agadez and a smaller U.S. facility near the airport.</p>
<p>Langley met with Niger’s top military chief, Brig. Gen. Moussa Salaou
Barmou, during the conference, and said military-to-military
communications continue but that it’s yet to be determined how much the
new transitional government will deal with the U.S.</p>
<p>Currently, he said, there are about 400 troops still at Agadez and
200 near the airport.</p>
<p>But, he added that “as we’re in transition and resetting, we need to
maintain capabilities to get enough intelligence to identify warnings of
a threat out there.”</p>
<p>Langley said the U.S. is still trying to assess the militant groups’
capabilities as they grow.</p>
<p>“Yes, they’ve been growing in number. Have they been growing in
capability where they can do what we call external ops attacks on the
homeland and attacks on allies, whether we’re talking about Europe or
anyone? That’s what we closely watch,” he said. “I’d say it has the
potential as they grow in numbers.”</p>
<p>Both Langley and Brown spoke more extensively about the need for the
U.S. and African nations to communicate more effectively and work
together to solve security and other problems.</p>
<p>And Brown acknowledged that the U.S. needs to “do better at
understanding the perspectives of others, ensuring their voices and
expertise don’t get drowned out.”</p>
<p>The U.S has struggled to maintain relations with African nations as
many foster growing ties to Russia and China.</p>
<p>Some African countries have expressed frustration with the U.S. for
forcing issues, such as democracy and human rights, that many see as
hypocrisy, given Washington’s close ties to some autocratic leaders
elsewhere. Meanwhile, Russia offers security assistance without
interfering in politics, making it an appealing partner for military
juntas that seized power in places like Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso in
recent years.</p>

protests mark the end of Pride month in US and beyond</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — The monthlong celebration of LGBTQ+ Pride reaches its
exuberant grand finale on Sunday, bringing rainbow-laden revelers to the
streets for marquee parades in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and
elsewhere across the globe.</p>
<p>The wide-ranging festivities will function as both jubilant parties
and political protests, as participants recognize the community’s gains
while also calling attention to recent anti-LGBTQ+ laws, such as bans on
transgender health care, passed by Republican-led states.</p>
<p>This year, tensions over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza are also
seeping into the celebrations, exposing divisions within a community
that is often aligned on political issues.</p>
<p>Already this month, pro-Palestinian activists have disrupted pride
parades held in Boston, Denver, and Philadelphia. Several groups
participating in marches Sunday said they would seek to center the
victims of the war in Gaza, spurring pushback from supporters of
Israel.</p>
<p>“It is certainly a more active presence this year in terms of protest
at Pride events,” said Sandra Pérez, the executive director of NYC
Pride. “But we were born out of a protest.”</p>
<p>The first pride march was held in New York City in 1970 to
commemorate the one-year anniversary of the Stonewall Inn uprising, a
riot that began with a police raid on a Manhattan gay bar.</p>
<p>In addition to the NYC Pride March, the nation’s largest, the city
will also play host Sunday to the Queer Liberation March, an
activism-centered event launched five years ago amid concerns that the
more mainstream parade had become too corporate.</p>
<p>Another one of the world’s largest Pride celebrations will also kick
off Sunday in San Francisco. Additional parades are scheduled in
Chicago, Minneapolis, and Seattle.</p>
<p>On top of concerns about protests, federal agencies have warned that
foreign terrorist organizations and their supporters could target the
parades and adjacent venues. A heavy security presence is expected at
all of the events.</p>

id="san-francisco-store-is-shipping-lgbtq-books-to-places-where-they-are-banned">San
Francisco store is shipping LGBTQ+ books to places where they are
banned</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO — In an increasingly divisive political sphere, Becka
Robbins focuses on what she knows best — books.</p>
<p>Operating out of a tiny room in Fabulosa Books in San Francisco’s
Castro District, one of the oldest gay neighborhoods in the United
States, Robbins uses donations from customers to ship boxes of books
across the country to groups that want them.</p>
<p>In an effort she calls “Books Not Bans,” she sends titles about queer
history, sexuality, romance and more — many of which are increasingly
hard to come by in the face of a rapidly growing movement by
conservative advocacy groups and lawmakers to ban them from public
schools and libraries.</p>
<p>“The book bans are awful, the attempt at erasure,” Robbins said. She
asked herself how she could get these books into the hands of the people
who need them the most.</p>
<p>Beginning last May, she started raising money and looking for
recipients. Her books have gone to places like a pride center in west
Texas and an LGBTQ-friendly high school in Alabama.</p>
<p>Customers are especially enthusiastic about helping Robbins send
books to places in states like Florida, Texas and Oklahoma, often
writing notes of support to include in the packages. Over 40% of all
book bans from July 2022 to June 2023 were in Florida, more than any
other state. Behind Florida are Texas and Missouri, according to a
report by PEN America, a nonprofit literature advocacy group.</p>
<p>Book bans and attempted bans have been hitting record highs,
according to the American Library Association. And the efforts now
extend as much to public libraries as school libraries. Because the
totals are based on media accounts and reports submitted by librarians,
the association regards its numbers as snapshots, with many bans left
unrecorded.</p>
<p>PEN America’s report said 30% of the bans include characters of color
or discuss race and racism, and 30% have LGBTQ+ characters or
themes.</p>
<p>The most sweeping challenges often originate with conservative
organizations, such as Moms for Liberty, which has organized banning
efforts nationwide and called for more parental control over books
available to children.</p>
<p>Moms for Liberty is not anti-LGBTQ+, co-founder Tiffany Justice has
told The Associated Press. But about 38% of book challenges that
“directly originated” from the group have LGBTQ+ themes, according to
the library association’s Office for Intellectual Freedom. Justice said
Moms for Liberty challenges books that are sexually explicit, not
because they cover LGBTQ+ topics.</p>
<p>Among those topping banned lists have been Maia Kobabe’s Gender
Queer, George Johnson’s All Boys Aren’t Blue and Nobel laureate Toni
Morrison’s The Bluest Eye.</p>
<p>Robbins said it’s more important than ever to makes these kinds of
books available to everyone.</p>
<p>“Fiction teaches us how to dream,” Robbins said. “It teaches us how
to connect with people who are not like ourselves, it teaches us how to
listen and emphasize.”</p>
<p>She’s sent 740 books so far, with each box worth $300 to $400,
depending on the titles.</p>
<p>At the new Rose Dynasty Center in Lakeland, Florida, the books
donated by Fabulosa are already on the shelves, said Jason DeShazo, a
drag queen known as Momma Ashley Rose who runs the LGBTQ+ community
center.</p>
<p>DeShazo is a family-friendly drag performer and has long hosted drag
story times to promote literacy. He uses puppets to address themes of
being kind, dealing with bullies and giving back to the community.</p>
<p>DeShazo hopes to provide a safe space for events, support groups and
health clinics, and to build a library of banned books.</p>
<p>“I don’t think a person of color should have to search so hard for an
amazing book about history of what our Black community has gone
through,” DeShazo said. “Or for someone who is queer to find a book that
represents them.”</p>
<p>Robbins’ favorite books to send are youth adult queer romances, a
rapidly growing genre as conversations about LGBTQ+ issues have become
much more mainstream than a decade ago.</p>
<p>“The characters are just like regular kids — regular people who are
also queer, but they also get to fall in love and be happy,” Robbins
said.</p>

id="schools-out-and-nyc-migrant-families-face-a-summer-of-uncertainty">School’s
out and NYC migrant families face a summer of uncertainty</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — When Damien Carchipulla started his first school year in
New York City in September, the first grader’s family was living in a
Manhattan hotel for migrant families.</p>
<p>In the 10 months since, the family of four from Ecuador has moved
shelters three times under a policy Mayor Eric Adams imposed in the fall
that limits the number of days migrants can stay in a single place.
Every 60 days they must give up their shelter beds and reapply for
housing or leave the system.</p>
<p>With a fourth move expected in a matter of weeks, Damien’s mother
Kimberly Carchipulla hopes the family isn’t pulled too far from the
6-year-old’s school in Harlem this summer. Her son is set to attend a
summer program starting in July.</p>
<p>“A lot has changed because new laws were put in place,” Carchipulla
said in Spanish while picking up Damien after school one day. “They get
stressed. They get upset. Every 60 days, it’s a new home.”</p>
<p>The New York City school year ended Wednesday, but for thousands of
migrant families the shuffle from shelter to shelter continues. With it
come the concerns about how they’ll navigate their children’s education
needs, both this summer and into the next school year.</p>
<p>“These families were already coming in with a great deal of trauma,
which was impacting their children’s attendance at school and their
ability to engage once they’re there,” said Sarah Jonas, a vice
president at Children’s Aid, a nonprofit that provides mentoring, health
services and after-school programs at city schools. “With that added
burden of the 60-day rule, we’ve seen even more disruption for our
families getting these eviction notices and all of the anxiety that
comes with that.”</p>
<p>Like the Carchipullas, most families chose to stick with the same
school through the year, even if they were reassigned to shelters in a
different part of the city. The tradeoff for many was longer and more
complex commutes, leading to children who were exhausted before the
school day even started. Absenteeism spiked too, as parents struggled to
get their children to school on time.</p>
<p>Carchipulla, who is 23, counts her family among the lucky ones: the
three moves they made during the school year were all to other midtown
Manhattan hotels, so her son’s daily commute remained relatively the
same.</p>
<p>For the grandchildren of Rosie Arias, the moves were more
disruptive.</p>
<p>The 55-year-old from Ecuador said her daughter arrived in January
with her 10-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter. They were immediately
placed in a shelter and enrolled in a local school where Spanish was
widely spoken.</p>
<p>But when their 60 days ran out, they had to move to another shelter
and transfer to another school, Arias said. Then when the family secured
their own apartment in Brooklyn, the children had to switch schools
again, this time to a smaller one where few people spoke Spanish.</p>
<p>“As a grandmother, I’m worried. The children don’t want to go to
school. They’re not adjusting because of the language and because they
don’t have friends.,” Arias said in Spanish. “They cry.”</p>
<p>School officials didn’t have a final tally for how many migrant
students were affected by the shelter time limits.</p>
<p>As of the first week of May, 44% of migrant students had remained in
the same shelter and same school since February 14, according to Tamara
Mair, a senior director with Project Open Arms, the district’s program
supporting asylum seekers and other new students in temporary
housing.</p>
<p>Another 40% of migrant students moved shelters but remained enrolled
at the same school, while 4% moved both schools and shelters, she said.
Roughly 10% left the school system entirely, with the “vast majority” of
those dropping out because they left the city.</p>
<p>District officials will be keeping tabs on migrant families in the
shelters through the summer, Mair said.</p>
<p>“The one thing we want to remain constant for our kids is school,”
she said. “But we also want to support our families with their choices,
because the families have the right to remain in their school, or they
may choose to go to a new school closer to their new residence.”</p>
<p>Adams, a Democrat, instituted shelter limits to encourage migrant
families to leave the city’s emergency shelter system, which includes
huge tent shelters and converted hotels that have swollen with thousands
of newcomers to the U.S.</p>
<p>Over the summer, more needs to be done to prepare newly arriving
families for the next school year, immigrant advocates say.</p>
<p>That includes better outreach to migrant parents and more investment
in translation services, said Liza Schwartzwald, a director at the New
York Immigration Coalition.</p>
<p>Schools also need more specialists to assess and help get migrant
students up to grade level in their studies, said Natasha Quiroga,
director of education policy at the New School’s Center for New York
City Affairs.</p>
<p>Damien Carchipulla’s mother remains optimistic about her son’s
future.</p>
<p>Eventually, she said, the family hopes to save up enough money for
their own place, perhaps in Queens, where her husband recently found
steady work.</p>
<p>“He is learning more and more every day,” Kim Carchipulla said of her
son. “Even if he misses school, his teacher tells me, he catches up
quickly.”</p>

id="prosecutors-meet-with-boeing-victims-families-as-charging-decision-looms-say-sources">Prosecutors
meet with Boeing, victims’ families as charging decision looms, say
sources</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — U.S. prosecutors are meeting with Boeing and the families
of crash victims as a July 7 deadline looms for the Justice Department
to decide whether to criminally charge the plane maker, according to two
people familiar with the matter and correspondence reviewed by Reuters.
 </p>
<p>Justice Department officials met with Boeing lawyers on Thursday to
discuss the government’s finding that the company violated a 2021
agreement with the department, one of the sources said. That deal, known
as a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA), had shielded it from criminal
prosecution over two 737 MAX crashes in 2018 in Indonesia and a crash in
2019 in Ethiopia that together killed 346 people.  </p>
<p>Separately, federal prosecutors are slated to meet with victims’
family members on Sunday to update them on the progress of their
investigation, according to the second person. U.S. officials are
working on a “tight timeline,” according to an email sent by the DOJ and
reviewed by Reuters.  </p>
<p>Boeing lawyers present case</p>
<p>Boeing’s lawyers from Kirkland &amp; Ellis on Thursday presented
their case to officials from the Deputy Attorney General’s office that a
prosecution would be unwarranted and that there is no need to tear up
the 2021 deal, one of the people said. </p>
<p>Such appeals from companies in the DOJ’s crosshairs are typical when
negotiating to resolve a government investigation.  </p>
<p>Officials want input from family members as they consider how to
proceed, the email said. Prosecutors from the Justice Department’s
criminal fraud division and the U.S. attorney’s office in Dallas will
attend the Sunday meeting, it said. </p>
<p>Spokespeople for the DOJ and Boeing declined to comment. </p>
<p>Boeing has previously said it has “honored the terms” of the
settlement and formally told prosecutors it disagrees with the finding
that it violated the agreement.  </p>
<p>Prosecutors recommend criminal charges</p>
<p>U.S. prosecutors have recommended to senior Justice Department
officials that criminal charges be brought against Boeing after finding
the plane maker violated the 2021 settlement, two people familiar with
the matter previously told Reuters. </p>
<p>The two sides are in discussions over a potential resolution to the
Justice Department’s investigation, and there is no guarantee officials
will move forward with charges, they said last week.  </p>
<p>The deliberations follow a January 5 flight during which a panel blew
out on a Boeing plane just two days before the company’s DPA expired.
The incident exposed ongoing safety and quality issues at Boeing. </p>
<p>Boeing had been poised to escape prosecution over a criminal charge
of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration
arising from the 2018-2019 fatal crashes.  </p>
<p>Prosecutors had agreed to drop a criminal charge so long as Boeing
overhauled its compliance practices and submitted regular reports over a
three-year period. Boeing also agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle the
investigation. </p>
<p>In May, officials determined the company breached the agreement,
exposing Boeing to prosecution. The DOJ said in a court filing in Texas
that the plane maker had failed to “design, implement, and enforce a
compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the
U.S. fraud laws throughout its operations.”</p>

inadequate facsimiles faithful only to one’s gauzy recollection. As
their chipsets are generally grossly underpowered and optimized solely
for cost, the vast majority didn’t even try to run the original games
precisely as they were, and the quality of the resulting rewrites
sometimes showed their software to be as rushed as the hardware. (Even
today, where true emulators are more plentiful, the SoCs these devices
use often still require compromise.) There were certainly standouts that
are practical miniatures of the original systems, notably the
<a href="https://www.commodore-info.com/article/item/c64dtv/en/desktop">Commodore
64 Direct-to-TV</a> and
<a href="https://flashback2.com/historical/">Atari Flashback 2</a>, but
the remainder during their zenith in the early 2000s were more like this
Intellivision and two Atari 2600 imposters, playing uneven resurrections
on unrelated silicon.</p>

But it turns out these three (and others) have something in common
besides the bargain bin: they’re all derived from our favourite chip,
the 6502. In fact, the two Atari imposters even embed the 6502’s 16-bit
descendant, the 65816. How do we know this? Rampant speculation, foggy
memory, datasheets and vidcaps — and taking them apart, of course.

I confess I fell into the DTV trap a couple times other than the C64
DTV, which is <a href="https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/C64DTV">enhanced
over the original</a> and really should be considered a distinct
Commodore computer of its own. I was Team Intellivision as a kid (we
went from an Atari Ultra Pong Doubles to a Tandyvision One), I got the
Intellvision Lives! CD for my Mac, and I figured the DTV version would
be a great cartridge-free small version. Instead, I ended up being so
disgusted with the abysmal quality of the ports that I’m pretty sure it
went in the <s>trash</s> electronics recycling almost immediately, or at
least I can’t find it anymore. Sometime ago I’d also got an AtGames
ColecoVision clone that was on sale, which also turned out to be crap
(sold it at a yard sale), and the convertible Tommo Neo Geo X which does
truly play in emulation but MAME was more convenient and so I found a
buyer for it. The only DTVs I ended up keeping were my modded C64 DTV
and a
<a href="https://www.commodore-info.com/computer/item/hummer/en/desktop">Hummer
direct-to-TV game</a> which is a later version of the C64 DTV hardware.
<p>
<p>Recently, however, someone mentioned the Winbond W55V9x series of
“TV-Toy” chips and this piqued my interest to see how hackable they
might be. But first let’s beat up on the Inty direct-to-TVs a bit more,
partially because I despise them in particular, but also because they
make a good technical lead-in.</p>

One of the most common architectures for early generation DTVs is the
so-called NES-on-a-chip (“NOAC”), which makes them little 6502s since
the Nintendo Entertainment System/Famicom was 6502-based, and the Inty
DTVs were all (near as I can determine) of this specific type.
Originally the various “Famiclones” made their own versions of the Ricoh
2A03/2A07 CPU (an NMOS 6502 with audio hardware and no decimal mode) and
2C02/2C07 PPU video chip, their clones of which were separate components
initially and later consolidated to reduce cost further. Such systems
were invariably accompanied by any required mapper hardware and ROMs.
The advantages of these clone chips were obvious — a community of people
already experienced in programming for them and an older chip that was
cheap to manufacture — and soon they appeared in all sorts of basic
applications like these beyond merely being knockoff NESes. The licensed
Inty DTVs came in various form factors differing pretty much only in
their shape, included games and menu interface.
<p>
<p>There is no loyalty to any particular architecture in DTVs because
cost is always the leading consideration. As such, notice the ominous
disclaimer on the box that I originally didn’t: “Original games have
been modified for optimal play on this device.” From a design
perspective, they already started in the hole because the NES
architecture was an especially bad fit for the Intellivision. Besides
the issue of an 8-bit CPU (the 6502) implementing games written for a
16-bit one (the Intellivision’s General Instrument CP1610), the NES PPU
maps somewhat poorly onto the Inty’s STIC video chip. The STIC can have
<a href="https://wiki.intellivision.us/index.php/STIC">independent
background and foreground colours</a> for each 8x8 “card,” but the PPU
only supports selecting colours from four pre-specified palettes in
<a href="https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/PPU_attribute_tables">groups of 4
tiles</a> (also 8x8 each), unless you use one of
<a href="https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/MMC5">the more sophisticated
mappers</a>. Moreover, the STIC generates a 159x96 (20x12 cards)
display, so you can’t get around that by doubling up on the PPU because
its display is 256x240 (32x30 tiles), though at least you’d have more
than enough pattern table overhead to support all 240 Inty on-screen
cards at once. Similarly, STIC sprites, eight per scanline, can all have
different colours and be dynamically stretched in hardware. Although the
PPU matches the sprites per scanline and allows multicoloured sprites,
it also does so off pre-specified palettes (modulo mapper) and doesn’t
have support for hardware resizing (i.e., for stretched sprites you’d
need additional precomputed sprite images). About the only thing that
did more or less directly port to NES hardware was the audio. While most
Inty games were simple enough to be translated with some thought, it so
happens that the NES PPU is not capable of accurately representing every
possible STIC frame, and it will become clear very quickly that the
programmers here didn’t use any thought anyway.</p>

<p>Intellivision Productions, then the owners of the Inty IP, licensed
various games and the trademark to Hong Kong-based Techno Source, who in
turn contracted out the software development to Chinese developer Nice
Code. Nice Code already had experience programming simple games for
famiclones and some of the work they did here turned up under other
names or with minor changes in other famiclone collections. (Later Inty
DTVs such as the X2 had games ported by an unknown Chinese firm instead
of Nice Code. However, they are still NOAC-based DTVs, and they still
sucked.)</p>

<p>On the top is the DTV version and on the bottom is a grab from my
usual GTE Sylvania Intellivision (ignore the red at the top, my TV tuner
box doesn’t like the picture even though it looks fine on my CRT games
TV). It makes sense they’d change the copyright message, and I’m
prepared to admit that at least <em>some</em> of the inaccurate colours
may be my capture box or problems with this specific unit (compare with
the contemporary
<a href="https://fcpic.nesbbs.com/GamePic.asp?gameid=7866">25 game
version</a>), but everything else is wrong. The font has incorrect
metrics, the digits in particular are vertically squashed, and they even
missed the exclamation point in the title. And let’s not forget that
pillarboxed background, either.</p>

It gets worse when you actually try to play (again, real system at the
bottom). The player sprite is double the size, the mountain background
is different and the stars look like clusters instead of points. The
meteors are also rendered incorrectly — my score is zero, I haven’t
actually shot anything — and game play is a strange combination of
weirdly jerky and unnervingly smooth, since the DTV’s sprite motion runs
approximately at NTSC 60fps yet the Intellivision EXEC animates sprites
at only 20fps. But the rotten smelly cherry on top of the fail sundae is
the mixed-up score panel once again featuring those obnoxiously bogus
digits. These aren’t trivial details! Seriously, did they make
<em>any</em> attempt to compare it with an actual Intellivision?
<p>
<p>The funny part is comparing this with the screenshots on the back of
the box, above, and even in the menu — which <em>are</em> correct, and
which were obviously taken from an actual Inty. Class action lawsuits
have been filed for less.</p>

The giveaway that this is an NOAC is its prominent crystal oscillator at
the distinctive speed of 21.47727MHz, though the embedded 6502 is
definitely not running that fast. Instead, the NOAC (and the original
NES, which this is a clone of, remember) divides this crystal by six for
the standard NTSC colour subcarrier frequency of 3.579545MHz (i.e.,
315/88 MHz) used by the PPU and by twelve for the actual CPU clock of
1.789773MHz. This crystal by far is most commonly found in NES-derived
hardware, though it also appears in various obscure arcade machines and
the NEC PC Engine (a/k/a TurboGrafx-16) and derivatives, also a
6502-based game system. Conversely, PAL NOACs and NESes are based on a
26.601712MHz crystal divided by 8 and 16 respectively along the same
basic notion.
<p>
<p>But if that didn’t convince you, the markings on the board should.
Eight lines run to the controller board and A/V outputs. From right to
left (in this view) they are ground, power, sound, a reset line,
composite video — and then three NES-specific lines used to interface
with the controller board, <tt>OUT0</tt>, <tt>RD4016</tt> and
<tt>4016D0</tt>. NES controllers are read out
<a href="https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Controller_reading">bit by bit</a>
from locations $4016 and $4017 by writing to the control register, which
goes out to the controller on the <tt>OUT</tt> line to select it, and
then reading each bit (<tt>4016D0</tt>) on each clock (<tt>RD4016</tt>).
This has a single controller, so it only has lines for working with
$4016; the two player Inty DTVs have additional lines for $4017. It’s
fabulously unlikely two lines clearly labeled with that specific address
would be present if the underlying architecture weren’t NES-based.</p>

<p>The chip closest to the crystal appears to be the actual SoC. Its
pinout, such as it is, and the use of a single oscillator are both
consistent with the UM6561, a very common NOAC used in many games that
has its own internal clock generator. The other chip is essentially a
tiny multicart containing the PRG-ROM (code for the CPU) and CHR-ROM
(image data for the PPU) for the main menu and each game along with any
needed mapper(s). As the two chips are connected by what is more or less
a hardwired NES cartridge port, it is possible, albeit after some work,
to <a href="https://forums.nesdev.org/viewtopic.php?t=24758">dump its
contents</a>.</p>

If we pull out the controller board with two more screws and turn it
over, we find one more IC also under globtop epoxy that appears to be a
UM6582. This chip provides the controller data for the 6561 using those
three NES-specific lines. It supports “turbo” (rapidfire) for the A/B
buttons (if you press turbo A or B, it triggers A or B plus a separate
turbo line), and the chip can perform rapidfire at three different
speeds, but only the basic “turbo” speed appears to be connected here.
The shoulder triggers are wired into the same A/B button lines on the
6582 with separate buttons for select, start and reset; the reset line
is fed directly to the 6561 through that 8-pin connector.
<p>
That’s the basics of a NOAC-based DTV and a particularly unadorned
example. We’re going to use it as a point of comparison for the
remainder of the article, but I promised you 16-bit DTVs, and now I’ll
bring you two — maybe even three.
<p>
<p>Compared to the 6502 the 65816 got comparatively few design wins
(though, in fairness, the 6502 got a <em>lot</em> of design wins), and
consequently is a much less frequently embedded processor. The two major
systems with a 65816 were the Apple IIgs, for which it was designed, and
the Super Nintendo, but what we’re about to talk about is most
definitely <em>not</em> a Super NES-on-a-chip. Let’s meet the Winbond
W55V91.</p>

<p>Winbond calls this chip a “TV-toy Controller.” It is an entire SoC
with a 65C816 core licensed from the Western Design Center, plus on-chip
video, sound, ROM, RAM and I/O. (We’re talking about it like it’s a
single chip, and the data sheet only ever depicts it as a single chip,
but I’ll drop a spoiler now that this is not the case for the units
we’ll look at.)</p>

The initial W55V91 supports up to 1152K of ROM (split into program ROM
and video ROM which is directly accessible to the onboard video) and
about 5.8K of RAM split into program or video memory. The onboard video
generates a single 320x240 video mode in either 4, 8, 16 or 256 colours
from a full 24-bit RGB range with two scrollable background layers, up
to 512 16x16 sprites (with maxima of 96 per frame and 12 per scanline)
and a top-most text overlay that can use 8x8 or 16x16 glyphs in a 27x8
matrix. On-core DMA handles quickly transferring data from PROM/PRAM
into VRAM. Audio consists of two tone generators and two white noise
generators which can be mixed. Interrupts can fire on the vertical or
horizontal blanks, I/O lines (8 input ports, 16 bidirectional ports), or
two timers, plus a separate watchdog which can reset the IC.
<p>
<p>Winbond developed at least four chips in this line starting with the
W55V91 around 2000, then the W55V92 and W55V93 in 2004, and finally the
(wait for it) W55V94 in 2005. They were produced more or less
simultaneously through at least 2006 and differ primarily in amount of
available RAM and ROM, plus (starting with the V93) a CMOS camera
interface for integrating video input. This interface only supports
display and is mixed in at the video encoder level, meaning capture data
can be seen onscreen without CPU assistance but is consequently
inaccessible to reading or manipulation by programs.</p>

<p>How a complex scene might be generated appears in this sample
screenshot from the V93/V94 datasheets. Input from an attached CMOS
sensor has the lowest priority and is overlaid first by background zero
(the blue backdrop) and then background one (the yellow “stage”), which
is higher priority than both. Both figures standing on stage are
composite sprites which can be individually above or below background
one. Finally, the text layer has the highest priority, with 16x16 glyphs
used for “CMOS interface” and 8x8 glyphs used for the “Manual Mode” text
at the bottom. However, these two DTVs don’t seem to use many of these
features and primarily treat the onboard video as a framebuffer with
sprites.</p>

<p>Both units are Atari 2600 DTVs produced by Jakks Pacific and were
some of the earliest such hardware. Jakks Pacific was Jack Friedman’s
final toy and games company before his death after LJN (sold initially
to MCA and later Acclaim and subsequently dissolved in 1994) and THQ
(bankrupt in 2013), founded in 1995 and expanded rapidly through
acquisitions. Toymax was one of these buyouts which had produced an
early Activision-specific 2600 DTV unit in 2001 and seems to have been
what launched Jakks’ own line.</p>

<p>NOACs have a notorious history in Atari 2600 DTVs (the original Atari
Flashback being the exemplar), but the Toymax Activision DTV is actually
another 65816 Winbond-based unit because Jakks used the exact same
hardware and developer (DC Studios) for their own joystick-based VCS DTV
in 2002, as we’ll demonstrate. Jakks also recased and sold the same
Activision DTV under their own brand using a joystick instead of a
gamepad, while the paddle-based VCS DTV came out in 2004. As HDTVs and
more advanced consoles proliferated, Jakks eventually jettisoned their
DTV line in the mid-2010s, though they’re
<a href="https://www.jakks.com/categories/">still in business selling
other toys</a>.</p>

<p>Jakks generally consolidated its DTV offerings under the TV Games and
Plug-it-in-and-Play TV Games brands, including several models with toy
and character tie-ins unrelated to classic video gaming. Despite being
the later of those models, we’re going to talk about the paddle Atari
DTV first because
<a href="https://pnp-info.angelfire.com/#cpus_table">there is
first-person recollection</a> that it was Winbond W55V9x-based. The
development period would make it most likely a W55V91, and none of these
toys have a need to use the more expensive V93/V94 because they don’t
have video input. From that information we’ll derive the joystick Atari
DTV’s architecture and by extension the “primordial” Toymax, though I
don’t personally have that unit here.</p>

<p>The exact formal name of this product is subject to some debate, but
it goes something like (deep breath) “Jakks Pacific Atari 2600
Plug-it-in-and-Play 13 TV Games Paddle.” It seems to have sold in decent
numbers as it’s not hard to track down (this unit was a few bucks on the
eBay), though the two-player version here is somewhat more uncommon. The
paddles really impressed me, particularly for ones intended purely as
toys. Each wheel has pretty good throw and spin feel and nice detents,
and the buttons are solid with a satisfying travel distance except for
RESET which is obnoxiously all but inaccessible. The plastic is
similarly thick and durable. Overall, I found the build quality
surprisingly high and a competent facsimile of my CX30s.</p>

<p>The reason we know the CPU/SoC in this unit is because of its
developer, Digital Eclipse. Digital Eclipse had a cottage industry
during the growing interest in emulation in the 1990s developing highly
precise emulations and recreations of older software and hardware. One
of their early specialties was Williams Electronics’ 6809-based arcade
games like Sinistar and Joust. In 1995 Dad had just bought an AT&amp;T
Globalyst PC from Computer City, a Pentium 75 that we were told came
with Windows 3.1 but actually came with the brand-spanking-new Windows
95. There was some consternation as a result because he primarily used
the PC for word processing with Ami Pro, though fortunately it worked
just fine (thanks, Raymond Chen!). I took advantage of this to buy the
Activision Commodore 64 15-Pack here (this is my original copy) which
was also out that year and also ran on Windows 95, but what I really
wanted it for was its legally cracked D64 versions of my favourite
titles like Portal, Park Patrol and Hacker. Unfortunately for Digital
Eclipse their own early emulator wasn’t <em>quite</em> as authentic as
<a href="/2023/05/refurb-weekend-commodore-128dcr.html">my Commodore
128DCR</a> sitting right next to the Pentium, but that was okay because
C64S wasn’t either, and their games loaded way faster than the 128 since
they didn’t emulate the disk drive and started from preloaded memory
images.</p>

<p>Plugging the main paddle in and turning it on, we get these copyright
messages, amusingly delivered in a modified Commodore 64 font (which is
itself a modification of the Atari 8-bit font). These two screens
immediately tell us it <em>can’t</em> be a standard NOAC. The text
display is fixed-width and C64 font glyphs are 8x8, which would limit
any NOAC-based hardware using them to 32 characters per line (i.e., 256
divided by 8), while these screens have several lines longer than that.
The TMS 9918A in the 99/4A and Tomy Tutor and many others <em>does</em>
have a 40-column mode at 256x192, but by compressing character glyphs to
6x8.</p>

<p>The main menu. You select games and options by rolling the primary
paddle and pressing the button. Only eleven of the titles are actually
VCS games; the other two are a recreation of Atari Pong and a visually
different but still entertaining take on arcade Warlords. This is a bit
of a skunk because that practically eliminates any incentive to play the
2600 Warlords also present, effectively cutting the “real” game count
down to twelve.</p>

The game’s formal credits screen is also accessible from the menu. It’s
always risky to count pixels on analogue grabs and its pixels are
slightly taller than they are wide, but let’s concentrate on the center
long line “Support Programming: George Phillips”. This is 36 characters
long and on this 640x480 grab roughly 512 pixels wide and 16 pixels
tall. That makes every 8x8 glyph roughly 14.2 by 16 pixels on this grab.
Since we know that the W55V9x series generates a 320x240 display, that
means all 30 rows of text occupy the entire screen vertically but for
each row the Winbond leaves roughly 18 pixels of horizontal gutter space
on the left and right. That would cover the TV-safe region on the sides
but a programmer would need to be mindful of the top and bottom borders
and not paint in them (or a CRT TV will cut those portions off). It
should also be obvious that all of this is being generated directly on
the SoC’s background layers because the character matrix is clearly
larger than 27x8.

<p>The source for the Winbond being used in this device was

<p>I don’t intend this to be a review, but looking at a couple games to
get an idea of its hardware features is instructive. Fortunately, unlike
a NOAC trying to act like a STIC (badly), the W55V9x is fully able to
draw an accurate 2600 TIA screen. Here is Breakout. The players and
missiles are easily represented with the W55V9x’s sprites, and the TIA
160x192 display and 128 colour NTSC palette are well within the
Winbond’s capabilities. As a practical matter it looks like Digital
Eclipse simply chose to double the horizontal pixels and vertically
centre the TIA display rows within the Winbond’s 240 line viewport,
which takes care of the TV-safe region. Sound at least in theory should
also be within the W55V9x’s tone generators’ range, both being
two-channel audio, though the sound effects in these games don’t sound
quite exact since the timbre differs. Still, it’s pretty close.</p>

<p>In each game, the menu button on the main paddle (not the side fire
button, which is the regular paddle button) brings up an array of
options you can modify. These vary from game to game. At the bottom is a
“virtual console” also drawn by Vavasour which you can use to flip the
VCS’s physical switches such as difficulty. You return to the main menu
by selecting the cartridge slot, since you’re wanting to insert a new
“cartridge.” Makes sense.</p>

<p>The simulations are generally complete enough to even model things
like those black “comb” lines on the left from positioning the TIA
players at the beginning of a scan line (remember that 2600 games must
“race the beam” with the CPU emitting screen data every line, every
frame), here shown in Night Driver. With minor exceptions, audio
notwithstanding, I found the games in this DTV to be very consistent
with my real Darth Vader 2600.</p>

<p>The Pong game is probably the weakest of the set and seems mostly
thrown in as a bonus easy-to-implement paddle title. Adding some of the
variation games would have seemed a logical step but this is “just
Pong.” It’s still a competent knockoff of Pong Doubles, at least
compared to my Ultra Pong Doubles unit; it’s just not as interesting as
the other games and there are other Pong consoles
<a href="/search/label/pong">I like better</a>.</p>

I did enjoy Warlords, though. I always liked it in the arcade and
although this conversion was consciously inaccurate, game play is fairly
on point compared to the real ROM running in MAME. Graphically the
screen had to be reformatted to prevent the arcade’s 256x240 framebuffer
from extending into the TV safe range on the top and bottom, requiring
scaling the display down to keep the same proportions and timing. I’d
say that was successful overall, though like I mentioned, its biggest
sin is that it renders the 2600 Warlords almost superfluous.
<p>
<p>Yeah, okay, you want me to crack it open now.</p>

My first impression is that there’s a lot of gunk on the board plus an
extended visit from the hot glue fairy. I can understand why many people
thought this was a NOAC device because the board superficially resembles
one, but the big difference is the crystal at Y1 (next to the blobtop at
U2) with a 27MHz value. This is the only supported operating frequency
for the W55V9x series, divided down by four to yield the 6.75MHz CPU
clock for the ’816, and is not a known master clock value for any NOAC I
could find.
<p>
<p>A bigger question is that the Winbond data sheet makes the SoC sound
like a single chip, but we have <em>two</em> blobtops here. The crystal
feeds U2, so the CPU core is probably there, but we can’t make too many
conclusions about U1 without digging the board out to trace the vias.
Some of the marked spots on the board are not populated and there is a
whole string of test points on one side.</p>

The joystick precedes the paddles by about two years. Really, Toymax
(and by extension DC Studios, who did the development and later went on
<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dc-studios-announces-the-return-of-the-commodore-64-in-an-all-new-direct-to-tv-d2tv-unit">to
work on the C64 DTV</a>) made it harder on themselves by starting off
with technologically advanced VCS games like the Activision series
first. These would have been very difficult to get right in simulation
due to their complex programming. Most contemporary reviews complained
about the conversion quality in both the Toymax Activision and DC
Studios VCS DTVs, and they might have been better served cutting their
teeth on the simpler games Digital Eclipse cloned with good success.
None of this is to take away anything from the quality of DE’s ports;
they merely benefitted further from less technically demanding games
that could be fully characterized more easily.

<p>The stick itself, while fatter and a little bottom heavy due to the
electronics in the base, actually feels a little flimsier and less
substantial than my real CX40. You can still “grab” it pretty well, but
I always preferred Wico sticks to these anyway.</p>

Main menu for the joystick VCS DTV and an example instruction screen
provided for each game (a nice touch). However, an immediately bad sign
is that games like Breakout, Pong and Circus were meant to be played
with <em>paddles</em>. Unlike the paddle DTV, the Pong here is from the
2600’s own Video Olympics, and does have proper variations.
<p>
Interestingly, the menu and background colour on this device extend
right out to the very edges of the display. There is no text there, but
there is colour and some lines. These could be sprite effects or the use
of a register not documented in the datasheet to widen the viewport.
<p>
<p>The text on the instruction screen is wide enough to demonstrate it
has the same basic resolution as the paddle DTV, and thus can’t be
generated as such by a standard NOAC. If you compare these grabs to
video captures of the Toymax Activision DTV, you’ll see
<a href="https://www.ataricompendium.com/archives/reviews/toymax/activision.html">it’s
the same</a> in nearly every respect except for the included games.</p>

Adventure felt really wrong. I never played it heavily on the real
system but even as a casual player this version just felt, um, off.
Other players opined that the dragons and game objects had different
properties, and Warren Robinette’s
<a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/atari-adventure/The_First_Easter_Egg">famous
easter egg</a> is apparently
<a href="https://forums.atariage.com/topic/15156-jakks-pacific-atari-10-in-1-game-system-review/">unobtainable</a>.
When you’ve lost Curt Vendel …
<p>
<p>Again, as a simulation it would have been exceptionally difficult to
track down all the behavioural edges in a game this densely packed, and
it shows. It would have been a big job for anybody. But that doesn’t
mean it gets a pass.</p>

The hard stuff: the screen and gameplay. It plays pretty well
<em>most</em> of the time. However, it does strangely lag sometimes when
you land a hit, and some players complained that the appearance didn’t
quite match the original. I wasn’t able to trigger the Warshaw initials
easter egg but I’m not a skillful player, so that doesn’t mean it can’t.
<p>
<p>On all of these titles, sound was largely regarded as “inspired by”
rather than “perfect cover band.” Most of the games didn’t sound much
like the VCS originals at all, whereas at least the paddle DTV sounds
were close, just not perfect.</p>

<p>Removing the four base screws allows the top stick to come off, but
to get to the top of the mainboard we’ll need to remove a second set of

Here is the front (upside down in the unit) and back of the mainboard.
The back has a plate on it which I took off to look at the traces; I
left the buttons alone, but they just attach with little rubber pegs
that can be popped out with care.
<p>
We again see our U1 and U2 globtops along with the 27MHz crystal we saw
in the paddle DTV. This almost certainly has to be the same Winbond
65816 SoC, and because the Toymax DTV uses the same menu and interface,
it’s almost certainly the same hardware as well. The crystal again feeds
U2.
<p>
The audio line is the white wire at the top left (northwest) corner of
the board. We can trace it along L4 down to C1 to enter U2. The video
line is the red wire between sound and ground (ha ha). It goes through
L6 and past an unpopulated C6 to enter U1. U1 also has an interesting
“P/N” jumper at JP2 that is not bridged (the solder blob is on N). In
the W55V91 datasheet pin 28 selects PAL (high) or NTSC (low), so leaving
the circuit broken appears to be setting it to NTSC.
<p>
The button pads are bit harder to trace because they start on the back
and exit in the front under some of the gobs of glue, but appear to
enter U2. Similarly, the lines from the front control board (yellow,
blue, teal and orange wires) also track into U2, including what looks
like the reset line, which is one of the yellow wires.
<p>
A number of lines bridge between U1 and U2 but some cursory continuity
testing of the exposed vias didn’t connect them with anything else.
These are likely some sort of bus. The block diagram shows two halves
with DMA between them, but the division isn’t clean on these boards
because while U1 seems to have more of the video features, to match the
block diagram it should also have the audio PSG, which is apparently in
U2. U2, however, appears to have all of the CPU facilities and I/O.
Whatever split we’re seeing here doesn’t seem to match the
documentation.
<p>
<p>Ideally we would like this to be set up the same as the NOAC where
the ROMs are on one side and the full SoC is on the other, but if first
appearances are to be believed, this apparently divides into a video
chip and “everything else.”</p>

Reassembling is easiest if you do it upside down like you disassembled
it, or otherwise the stick insert and button will fall out. The buttons
all have little thin guides that they slot into.
<p>
The NOAC DTVs are cheap and nasty, but they’re surprisingly hackable if
you’re prepared to do some fiddling, and their contents can be
transplanted to bigger units. Unfortunately, assuming the ROMs on each
end (VROM in U1, PROM in U2) are all blobbed together in each die, it
doesn’t look like it’s possible to dump — let alone reprogram — the
Winbond 65C816 SoCs without decapping and destroying them to visually
inspect their contents. Maybe that was on purpose. But these devices at
least are so cheap and exist in such numbers that such a sacrifice seems
reasonable to yield useful insight into other such units. If you’ve done
this or want to partner on it, post in the comments.
<p>
<p>Either way, though, it turns out the 65816 was in a lot more devices
than just the obvious explicit ones. The Winbond W55V9x series is no
Super NES in a chip, but it’ll do until one comes along. Let’s hear it
for tiny 16-bit consoles.</p>

<p>It’s been a long while since I have felt really positive about most
of what I have been reading and seeing in AI. Not because I inherently
dislike AI, but because I feel like so many folks have been brainwashed
by the “scale is all you need” notion and “AGI in 2025” (or 2027 or
2029) nonsense, none of which seems remotely plausible to me as a

<h2 id="us-europe-warn-lebanons-hezbollah-to-ease-strikes-on-israel">US,
Europe warn Lebanon’s Hezbollah to ease strikes on Israel</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S., European and Arab mediators are pressing to keep
stepped-up cross-border attacks between Israel and Lebanon’s Iran-backed
Hezbollah militants from spiraling into a wider Middle East war that the
world has feared for months.  </p>
<p>Iran and Israel traded threats Saturday of what Iran said would be an
“obliterating” war over Hezbollah.  </p>
<p>Hopes are lagging for a cease-fire in Israel’s conflict with Hamas in
Gaza that would calm attacks by Hezbollah and other Iranian-allied
militias. With the stalled talks in mind, American and European
diplomats and other officials are delivering warnings to Hezbollah,
which is far stronger than Hamas but seen as overconfident about taking
on the military might of Israel, current and former diplomats say. </p>
<p>The Americans and Europeans are warning the group it should not count
on the United States or anyone else being able to hold off Israeli
leaders if they decide to execute battle-ready plans for an offensive
into Lebanon. And Hezbollah should not count on its fighters’ ability to
handle whatever would come next. </p>
<p>Strikes appear to level off</p>
<p>On both sides of the Lebanese border, escalating strikes between
Israel and Hezbollah, one of the region’s best-armed fighting forces,
appeared at least to level off this week. While daily strikes still
pound the border area, the slight shift offered hope of easing immediate
fears, which had prompted the U.S. to send an amphibious assault ship
with a Marine expeditionary force to join other warships in the area in
hopes of deterring a wider conflict. </p>
<p>Despite this past week’s plateauing of hostilities, said Gerald
Feierstein, a former senior U.S. diplomat in the Middle East,” it
certainly seems the Israelis are still … arranging themselves in the
expectation that there will be some kind of conflict … an entirely
different magnitude of conflict.” </p>
<p>The message being delivered to Hezbollah is “don’t think that you’re
as capable as you think you are,” he said. </p>
<p>Potentially ‘terrible consequences’</p>
<p>Beginning the day after Hamas’ October 7 attacks on Israel triggered
the war in Gaza, Hezbollah has launched rockets into northern Israel and
vowed to continue until a cease-fire takes hold. Israel has hit back,
with the violence forcing tens of thousands of civilians from the border
in both countries. Attacks intensified this month after Israel killed a
top Hezbollah commander and Hezbollah responded with some of its biggest
missile barrages. </p>
<p>United Nations humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths used the word
“apocalyptic” to describe a war that could result. Both Israel and
Hezbollah, the dominant force in politically fractured Lebanon, have the
power to cause heavy casualties. </p>
<p>“Such a war would be a catastrophe for Lebanon,” Defense Secretary
Lloyd Austin said as he met recently with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav
Gallant at the Pentagon. “Another war between Israel and Hezbollah could
easily become a regional war, with terrible consequences for the Middle
East.” </p>
<p>Gallant, in response, said, “We are working closely together to
achieve an agreement, but we must also discuss readiness on every
possible scenario.”</p>
<p>Analysts expect that other Iran-allied militias in the region would
respond far more forcefully than they have for Hamas, and some experts
warn of ideologically motivated militants streaming into the region to
join in. Europeans fear destabilizing refugee flows. </p>
<p>And if it looks like any Israeli offensive in Lebanon is “going
seriously south for the Israelis, the U.S. will intervene,” Feierstein
said. “I don’t think that they would see any alternative to that.” </p>
<p>While Iran, which is preoccupied with a political transition at home,
shows no sign of wanting a war now, it sees Hezbollah as its
strategically vital partner in the region, much more so than Hamas, and
could be drawn in. </p>
<p>Upping tensions, Iran’s U.N. mission said in a posting Saturday on X
that an “obliterating” war would ensue if Israel launches a full-scale
attack in Lebanon. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz responded by
pledging his country would move against Hezbollah with “full force”
unless it stopped attacks. </p>
<p>While the U.S. helped Israel knock down a barrage of Iranian missiles
and drones in April, the U.S. likely would not do as well assisting
Israel’s defense against any broader Hezbollah attacks, said General
Charles Q. Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It is harder to
fend off the shorter-range rockets that Hezbollah fires routinely across
the border, he said. </p>
<p>The Israeli army is stretched after a nearly 9-month war in Gaza, and
Hezbollah holds an estimated arsenal of some 150,000 rockets and
missiles capable of striking anywhere in Israel. Israeli leaders,
meanwhile, have pledged to unleash Gaza-like scenes of devastation on
Lebanon if a full-blown war erupts. </p>
<p>White House senior adviser Amos Hochstein, President Joe Biden’s
point person on Israel-Hezbollah tensions, has not been successful so
far in getting the two sides to dial back the attacks. </p>
<p>The French, who have ties as Lebanon’s former colonial power, and
other Europeans also are mediating, along with the Qataris and
Egyptians. </p>
<p>White House officials have blamed Hezbollah for escalating tensions
and said it backs Israel’s right to defend itself. The Biden
administration also has told the Israelis that opening a second front is
not in their interest. That was a point hammered home to Gallant during
his latest talks in Washington with Secretary of State Antony Blinken,
Austin, CIA Director William Burns, national security adviser Jake
Sullivan, Hochstein and others. </p>
<p>“We’re going to continue to help Israel defend itself; that’s not
going to change,” White House national security spokesman John Kirby
said. “But as for a hypothetical — specifically with respect to the
northern border line … again, we want to see no second front opened, and
we want to see if we can’t resolve the tensions out there through
diplomatic processes.” </p>
<p>White House officials, however, are not discounting the real
possibility that a second front in the Mideast conflict could open. </p>
<p>In conversations with Israeli and Lebanese officials and other
regional stakeholders, there is agreement that “a major escalation is
not in anybody’s interest,” a senior Biden administration official
said. </p>
<p>The official, who was not authorized to comment publicly about White
House deliberations and spoke on condition of anonymity, bristled at the
“purported logic” of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah arguing that
Israel would see an end to Hezbollah attacks by reaching a cease-fire
agreement with Hamas in Gaza. </p>
<p>But the official also acknowledged that an elusive cease-fire deal in
Gaza would go a long way in quieting tensions on the Israel-Lebanon

moving tons of aid from US-built pier after work suspended</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>JERUSALEM — Humanitarian workers have started moving tons of aid that
piled up at a United States-built pier off the Gaza coast to warehouses
in the besieged territory, the United Nations said Saturday, an
important step as the U.S. considers whether to resume pier operations
after yet another pause due to heavy seas.</p>
<p>It was not clear when the aid might reach Palestinians in the Gaza
Strip, where experts have warned of the high risk of famine as the war
between Israel and Hamas militants is in its ninth month. This is the
first time trucks have moved aid from the pier since the U.N.’s World
Food Program suspended operations there due to security concerns on June
9.</p>
<p>Millions of pounds of aid have piled up. In just the last week, more
than 4.5 million kilograms (10 million pounds) were moved ashore,
according to the U.S. military.</p>
<p>A WFP spokesperson, Abeer Etefa, told The Associated Press this is a
one-time operation until the beach is cleared of the aid and is being
done to avoid spoilage.</p>
<p>Further U.N. operations at the pier depend on U.N. security
assessments, Etefa said.</p>
<p>The U.N. is investigating whether the pier was used in an Israeli
military operation last month to rescue three hostages.</p>
<p>If WFP trucks successfully bring the aid to warehouses inside Gaza,
that could affect the U.S. military’s decision whether to reinstall the
pier, which was removed due to weather Friday. U.S. officials said they
were considering not reinstalling the pier because of the possibility
that the aid would not be picked up.</p>
<p>Even if the U.N. decides to keep transporting aid from the pier into
Gaza, lawlessness around humanitarian convoys will be a further
challenge to distribution. The convoys have come under attack in Gaza.
While most aid deliveries come by land, restrictions around border
crossings and on what items can enter Gaza have further hurt a
population that was already dependent on humanitarian aid before the
war.</p>
<p>The June 9 pause at the pier came after the Israeli military used a
nearby area to fly out hostages after their rescue in a raid that killed
more than 270 Palestinians, prompting a U.N. review over concerns that
aid workers’ safety and neutrality may have been compromised.</p>
<p>Battles continue</p>
<p>More than 37,800 Palestinians have been killed in the war since it
began with Hamas’ attack on southern Israel on October 7, according to
Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and
combatants in its toll. The ministry said the bodies of 40 people killed
by Israeli strikes had been brought to local hospitals over the past 24
hours.</p>
<p>At least two people were killed and six injured, including a child,
in a strike in Bureij camp in central Gaza.</p>
<p>The October 7 Hamas attack killed some 1,200 people, mostly
civilians, and another 250 people were taken hostage.</p>
<p>Israeli forces have been battling Palestinian militants in an eastern
part of Gaza City over the last week. Tens of thousands of Palestinians
have fled their homes, according to the U.N.</p>
<p>“It’s like the first weeks of the invasion,” one resident, Mahmoud
al-Masry, said of the intensity of the fighting. “Many people were
killed. Many houses were destroyed. They strike anything moving.”</p>
<p>The Israeli military acknowledged an operation against Hamas fighters
in Shijaiyah and Saturday noted “close-quarters combat.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere, thousands of Palestinians who remained in Gaza’s
southernmost city of Rafah fled Friday for Muwasi, a crowded coastal
tent camp designated by the Israeli army as a safe zone. Some told the
AP they evacuated because Israeli gunfire and missiles had come close to
where they were sheltering.</p>
<p>Over 1.3 million Palestinians have fled Rafah since Israel’s
incursion into the city in early May, while aid groups warn there are no
safe places to go.</p>
<p>With the heat in Gaza reaching over 32 degrees Celsius (89
Fahrenheit), many displaced people have found tents unbearable. The
territory has been without electricity since Israel cut off power as
part of the war, and Israel also stopped pumping drinking water to the
enclave.</p>
<p>“Death is better than it, it is a grave,” said Barawi Bakroun, who
was displaced from Gaza City, as others fanned themselves with pieces of
cardboard.</p>

appeals to donors concerned about debate performance</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — U.S. President Joe Biden is looking to recapture his mojo
and reassure donors at a Saturday fundraiser that he is fully up to the
challenge of beating Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The 81-year-old’s troubling performance at the first presidential
debate Thursday rattled many Democrats, who see Trump after the January
6, 2021, insurrection as an existential threat to U.S. democracy.
Biden’s meandering answers and struggles to respond to Trump prompted
The New York Times editorial board to declare Friday that he should exit
the race and that staying in would be a “reckless gamble.”</p>
<p>Biden and his wife, Jill, planned to attend an afternoon campaign
meeting in East Hampton, New York, the Long Island beach town where the
real estate firm Zillow prices the median home at $1.9 million.
Scheduled later was an evening fundraiser in Red Bank, New Jersey.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of Thursday night’s debate, Biden flashed more vigor
in speeches in North Carolina and New York on Friday, saying he believes
with “all my heart and soul” that he can do the job of the
presidency.</p>
<p>The Biden campaign said it has raised more than $27 million on
Thursday and Friday, including $3 million at a New York City fundraiser
focused on the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
<p>Jill Biden told supporters Friday that he said to her after the
debate, “You know, Jill, I don’t know what happened. I didn’t feel that
great.” The first lady then said she responded to him, “Look, Joe, we
are not going to let 90 minutes define the four years that you’ve been
president.”</p>
<p>The Democratic president still needs to allay the fears stirred by
the debate as it seeped into the public conscience with clips and memes
spreading on the internet and public pressure for him to bow out of the
race.</p>
<p>Democratic donors across New York, Southern California and Silicon
Valley privately expressed deep concerns about the viability of Biden’s
campaign in the wake of his debate performance.</p>
<p>In a series of text message chains and private conversations, they
discussed the short list of possible replacements, a group that included
Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, California Governor Gavin Newsom and
Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>But on Friday, there was no formal push to pressure Biden to step
aside, and some suspected there never would be given the logistical
challenges associated with replacing the presumptive nominee just four
months before Election Day.</p>
<p>Some donors noted they were going to pause their personal giving.
They said receipts from Biden’s weekend fundraiser would almost
certainly be strong because the tickets were sold and paid for before
the debate.</p>

id="democracy-advocates-worry-jan.-6-capitol-riot-is-being-forgotten">Democracy
advocates worry Jan. 6 Capitol riot is being forgotten</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — In the first presidential debate, Republican Donald
Trump skimmed over the January 6, 2021, attack at the Capitol, shifted
blame for the violent mob siege and declined repeatedly to state
unequivocally that he will accept the results of this year’s White House
election.</p>
<p>And President Joe Biden, who has said the work of his presidency is
to restore the soul of the nation, flubbed and floundered, failing to
forcefully confront, contradict and hold Trump, the indicted former
president, accountable for the attack on the election — and
democracy.</p>
<p>It is an extraordinary moment, or lack of one, that is alarming to
democracy advocates, the far-reaching effort to overturn the 2020
election and the subsequent insurrection that defined the Trump
presidency fading from view during the opening debate of the general
election campaign.</p>
<p>Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson, the Democrat who chaired the
House’s January 6 committee investigation in the last Congress, said it
is a deeply unfortunate situation.</p>
<p>“We could have a January 6, 2.0,” Thompson said Friday outside the
Capitol.</p>
<p>The outcome underscores the choice Americans face this fall as the
riot over the 2020 election remains fundamental to the 2024 campaign,
but also obscured by it, despite the four-count federal indictment
against Trump for working to overturn the results four years ago in the
run-up to the violent siege and despite the convictions of more than
1,000 people in the Capitol attack.</p>
<p>It comes as the Supreme Court is weighing cases involving January 6,
including a decision Friday that makes it easier for some rioters to
contest their charges and convictions, and another expected Monday on
whether Trump can claim immunity in the federal election case.</p>
<p>All told, what seemed politically untenable, as the defeated Trump
departed Washington downcast on Biden’s inauguration day on January 20,
2021, is now within reach as the president who tried to overturn an
election is the Republican Party’s presumptive nominee, edging toward an
Oval Office return.</p>
<p>“We are four months away from the first presidential election since a
violent attack on our Capitol. … And the man responsible for that —
Donald Trump — is currently the leading candidate,” said Ian Bassin,
executive director of the advocacy group Protect Democracy, which works
to counter authoritarianism.</p>
<p>“You’d think that alone would be disqualifying, or at a minimum would
be the central focus of the election,” he said.</p>
<p>And yet, Bassin said, the topic was “relegated to an afterthought” in
the debate, “and the current president is struggling to press the case
on why this issue should be of existential importance.”</p>
<p>The forum itself is not necessarily to blame. The moderators pressed
the candidates, asking Trump not once, but repeatedly, whether he would
commit to not having another January 6 and accepting the results of the
election this time.</p>
<p>Trump insisted he had “virtually nothing to do” with the storming of
the Capitol on January 6 and tried to shift blame to then-House Speaker
Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, repeating his false claims about the delay in
sending in the National Guard.</p>
<p>Biden, whose underwhelming debate performance of stunted answers and
trailing thoughts has sent the Democratic Party into turmoil, struggled
to deliver a cohesive response, despite having given high-profile
speeches about January 6, including on the first anniversary.</p>
<p>“Look, he encouraged those folks to go up on Capitol Hill,” Biden
said on the debate stage.</p>
<p>Thompson, whose committee produced a lengthy, 1,000-plus page report
on its investigation into Trump’s monthslong attempt to overturn the
election and the storming of the Capitol, said Biden missed a “golden
opportunity” to set the record straight as millions of people watched
the debate.</p>
<p>It was left to the people who actually experienced January 6, the
lawmakers who fled to safety as the mob of Trump supporters approached,
to respond. Rioters, many wielding flag poles and with tactical gear,
engaged in brutal, bloody hand-to-hand combat, fighting the U.S. Capitol
Police to gain access to the building.</p>
<p>“January 6 was a dark day,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck
Schumer, a Democrat, on social media.</p>
<p>“Trump-inspired insurrectionists sought to obstruct the peaceful
transfer of power,” he said. Schumer decried Friday’s “shameful
decision” from the Supreme Court that he said “will embolden
anti-democracy radicals and make it harder for our judicial system to
try insurrectionists.”</p>
<p>Pelosi said Trump presented “another pack of lies” during the debate.
“How dare he place the blame for January 6th on anyone but himself, the
inciter of an insurrection?”</p>
<p>On Friday, the Supreme Court limited a federal obstruction law that
has been used to charge Trump, alongside hundreds of Capitol riot
defendants. While the ruling is certain to cause a reconsideration of
some cases against the rioters, it is unclear how it will impact Trump’s
indictment, which includes other charges.</p>
<p>Trump, during a rally Friday in Chesapeake, Virginia, said a “great
thing” just happened in response to the decision in the obstruction
case, to the roar of “USA!” chants from the crowd.</p>
<p>“They should be immediately released — immediately,” Trump said about
the defendants he called “the J6 hostages.”</p>
<p>A more energized Biden, at his own rally in the swing state of North
Carolina, said, “The choice in this election is simple. Donald Trump
will destroy our democracy. I will defend it.”</p>

tankers, helicopters attack Arizona wildfire near Phoenix</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SCOTTSDALE, Arizona — Air tankers and helicopters helped douse flames
from the sky as nearly 200 firefighters on the ground battled a wildfire
northeast of Phoenix on Friday that threatened scores of homes and
forced dozens of residents to evacuate.</p>
<p>Authorities expanded the evacuation area in a subdivision on the
northeast outskirts of Scottsdale, closed roads and shut down part of a
nature preserve as gusty winds continued to fan the flames in extremely
hot, dry conditions.</p>
<p>But there were no immediate reports of injuries or structure damage,
Arizona fire officials said.</p>
<p>Near Phoenix, where the high reached 43.3 degrees Celsius (110
Fahrenheit) Friday, about 60 residents evacuated homes in the Boulder
Heights subdivision overnight after the human-caused fire broke out
about 2:30 p.m. Thursday.</p>
<p>Fire officials said they were investigating exactly what sparked the
blaze about 8 kilometers (5 miles) east of Carefree, just outside
northern Scottsdale on the edge of the Tonto National Forest.</p>
<p>Dubbed the Boulder View Fire, it has burned about 13 square
kilometers (5 square miles) with zero containment, authorities said.</p>
<p>“The southeast side of the fire remained active throughout the night
producing 20-to-40-foot flame lengths in areas,” Tiffany Davila, a
spokesperson for the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management,
said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Additional resources were redirected to that side of the fire last
night to begin structure protection and help crews start firing
operations to tie the fire into nearby roads,” she said.</p>
<p>The Red Cross set up an evacuation center at a high school in
Scottsdale, and shelters for horses and other large animals were
established at several locations, including the rodeo grounds at nearby
Cave Creek.</p>
<p>Scottsdale officials closed part of the McDowell Sonoran Preserve as
a precaution but said there was no immediate threat.</p>
<p>The air tankers armed with red retardant and helicopters hauling
giant buckets of water helped ground crews keep the flames away from
power lines in the area so far, fire officials said.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service said above-normal temperatures will
persist well into next week, with many lower desert locations seeing
highs near or exceeding 43.3 degrees C (110 F) each afternoon.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in central Oregon, fire officials were releasing some crews
from the lines south of Bend because conditions have improved, and the
threat posed by a wildfire to the community around La Pine has decreased
after hundreds were evacuated earlier this week.</p>
<p>Firefighters said Friday they had dug fire lines around nearly half
of the Darlene 3 fire, near La Pine, which has now burned an estimated
15.5 square kilometers (6 square miles) and was listed at 42%
containment.</p>
<p>And in Central California, about 200 firefighters were making
progress on a large blaze that has burned an estimated 23.3 square
kilometers (9 square miles) about 97 kilometers (60 miles) east of
Fresno. It was the only one still burning of 18 fires that were sparked
by lightning along the western edge of the Sierra Nevada when a storm
moved through this week, officials said.</p>

id="amid-north-korea-china-threats-us-pursues-partnerships-with-asian-allies">Amid
North Korea, China threats, US pursues partnerships with Asian
allies</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>GIMHAE AIR BASE, South Korea — The United States wrapped up its first
multidomain exercise with Japan and South Korea in the East China Sea on
Saturday, a step forward in Washington’s efforts to strengthen and lock
in its security partnerships with key Asian allies in the face of
growing threats from North Korea and China.</p>
<p>The three-day Freedom Edge increased the sophistication of previous
exercises with simultaneous air and naval drills geared toward improving
joint ballistic-missile defense, anti-submarine warfare, surveillance
and other skills and capabilities.</p>
<p>The exercise, which is expected to expand in years to come, was also
intended to improve the countries’ abilities to share missile warnings —
increasingly important as North Korea tests ever-more sophisticated
systems.</p>
<p>Other than Australia, Japan and South Korea are the only U.S.
partners in the region with militaries sophisticated enough to integrate
operations with the U.S. so that if, for example, South Korea were to
detect a target, it could quickly relay details so Japanese or American
counterparts could respond, said Ridzwan Rahmat, a Singapore-based
analyst with the defense intelligence company Janes.</p>
<p>“That’s the kind of interoperability that is involved in a typical
war scenario,” Rahmat said. “For trilateral exercises like this, the
intention is to develop the interoperability between the three armed
forces so that they can fight better as a cohesive fighting force.”</p>
<p>Such exercises also carry the risk of increasing tensions, with China
regularly denouncing drills in what it considers its sphere of
influence, and North Korea already slamming the arrival of the USS
Theodore Roosevelt carrier group in the port of Busan — home to South
Korea’s navy headquarters and its Gimhae Air Base — in preparation for
Freedom Edge as “provocative” and “dangerous.”</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the day after South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol
visited the Roosevelt in Busan, becoming the first sitting South Korean
president to board a U.S. aircraft carrier since 1994, North Korea
tested what it said was a multiwarhead missile, the first known launch
of the developmental weapon, if confirmed.</p>
<p>South Korea’s military said a joint analysis by South Korean and U.S.
authorities assessed that the North Korean missile launch failed.</p>
<p>The defense cooperation involving Japan and South Korea is also
politically complex for Yoon and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida,
due to the lingering resentment over Imperial Japan’s brutal occupation
of Korea before and during World War II.</p>
<p>The two countries have the largest militaries among American allies
in East Asia — and together host some 80,000 American troops on their
territories — but the U.S. has tended to work with them individually
rather than together due to their history.</p>
<p>Kishida’s increase of defense spending and cooperation with South
Korea have generally been well received by the Japanese public but has
caused friction with the right wing of his own party, while Yoon’s
domestic appeal has weakened, but he has stayed the course.</p>
<p>“South Korea’s shift under the Yoon administration toward improving
its relations with Japan has been extremely significant,” said Heigo
Sato, international politics professor and security expert at Takushoku
University in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Both leaders are seen to be trying to fortify their defense
relationships with Washington ahead of the inauguration of a new
president, with South Korean officials saying recently that they hope to
sign a formal security framework agreement with the U.S. and Japan this
year that would lock in a joint approach to responding to a possible
attack from North Korea.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration has also long been working
to increase cooperation between South Korea and Japan — something that
many didn’t think was possible at the start of his presidency, said Euan
Graham, a defense analyst with the Australian Strategic Policy
Institute.</p>
<p>“Credit where it’s due — the fact that it’s happening is a
significant achievement from the administration’s regional policy,” he
said.</p>
<p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump caused friction with both allies
during his time in office by demanding greater payment for their hosting
of U.S. troops while holding one-on-one meetings with North Korea’s Kim
Jong Un.</p>
<p>Under Biden, Washington is seeking to solidify its system of
alliances, both with increasingly sophisticated exercises and diplomatic
agreements, Graham said.</p>
<p>Tensions with North Korea are at their highest point in years, with
the pace of Kim Jong Un’s weapons programs intensifying, despite heavy
international sanctions.</p>
<p>China, meanwhile, has been undertaking a massive military buildup of
nuclear and conventional weapons, and now has the world’s largest navy.
It claims both the self-governing island of Taiwan and virtually the
entirety of the South China Sea as its own territory and has
increasingly turned to its military to press those claims.</p>
<p>China and North Korea have also been among Russia’s closest allies in
its war against Ukraine, while Russia and China are also key allies for
North Korea, as well as the military leaders of Myanmar who seized power
in 2021 and are facing ever-stiffer resistance in that country’s civil
war.</p>
<p>In Pyongyang this month, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Kim
concluded a mutual defense pact, agreeing to come to the other’s aid in
the event of an attack, rattling others in the region.</p>
<p>Despite a greater number of ships overall, China still only has three
aircraft carriers compared to the U.S. fleet’s 11 — probably the most
effective tool a country has to bring vast amounts of power to bear at a
great distance from home.</p>
<p>China’s advantage, however, is that its primary concern is the nearby
waters of the Indo-Pacific, while Washington’s global focus means that
its naval assets are spread widely. Following the exercises in the East
China Sea with Japan and South Korea, the Roosevelt is due to sail to
the Middle East to help protect ships against attacks by Yemen’s Houthi
rebels.</p>
<p>That has made strong security partnerships even more important, not
only with Japan and South Korea but with Australia, the Philippines,
Taiwan and others in the region, and building those up has been a
priority for the Biden administration.</p>

for vice president?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Who will U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump pick to be his vice
presidential running mate? With the Republican National Convention
approaching next month, Trump has been mum about his choice, but several
contenders have emerged. VOA’s Tina Trinh tells us each of those
prospective running mates brings an opportunity to expand Trump’s base
of support.</p>

<h2 id="us-military-says-it-destroyed-7-drones-vehicle-in-yemen">US
military says it destroyed 7 drones, vehicle in Yemen</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — American forces destroyed seven drones and a control
station vehicle in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen over the past 24
hours, the U.S. military said Friday.</p>
<p>The strikes were carried out because the drones and the vehicle
“presented an imminent threat to U.S. coalition forces, and merchant
vessels in the region,” the U.S. Central Command said in a statement on
social media platform X.</p>
<p>The Iran-backed Houthis have been targeting vessels in the Red Sea
and Gulf of Aden since November 2023 in attacks they say are in
solidarity with Palestinians during the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza
Strip.</p>
<p>On Friday, Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree claimed
responsibility for attacks on four vessels, including a “direct hit” on
the Delonix tanker in the Red Sea after an operation involving a number
of ballistic missiles.</p>
<p>However, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) said
five missiles were fired on Friday in “close proximity” to this vessel,
which it said reported no damage. </p>
<p>The Delonix was located around 277 kilometers northwest of the
Houthi-controlled port of Hodeida when it was attacked, according to
UKMTO, which is run by Britain’s Royal Navy.</p>
<p>The Houthis also claimed attacks on the Waler oil tanker and Johannes
Maersk container ship in the Mediterranean Sea and the Ioannis bulk
carrier in the Red Sea.</p>
<p>The United States in December announced a maritime security
initiative to protect Red Sea shipping from Houthi attacks, which have
forced commercial vessels to divert from the route that normally carries
12% of global trade.</p>
<p>CENTCOM said its strike on Friday was carried out “to protect freedom
of navigation and make international waters safer and more secure.”</p>
<p>“This continued malign and reckless behavior by the Iranian-backed
Houthis threatens regional stability and endangers the lives of mariners
across the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.”</p>
<p>The attacks have sent insurance costs spiraling for vessels
transiting the Red Sea and prompted many shipping firms to take the far
longer passage around the southern tip of Africa instead.</p>

is a Gutenberg Bible? And why is it relevant 500 years after its
printing?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — It’s not just a book.</p>
<p>Back in the 1450s, when the Bible became the first major work printed
in Europe with moveable metal type, Johannes Gutenberg was a man with a
plan.</p>
<p>The German inventor decided to make the most of his new technology —
the movable-type printing press — by producing an unprecedented version
of the scripture for wealthy customers who could interpret Latin:
leaders of the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>Though he planned on printing 150 Bibles, increasing demand motivated
him to produce 30 extra copies, which led to a total of 180. Currently
known as the “Gutenberg Bibles,” around 48 complete copies are
preserved.</p>
<p>None is known to be kept in private hands. Among those in the United
States, a paper Bible can be seen at the Morgan Library &amp; Museum, in
New York City. Two more copies in vellum lie in the underground vaults,
next to 120,000 other books.</p>
<p>Why should anyone — religiously observant or not — feel compelled to
see a Gutenberg Bible up close? Here’s a look at how its printing
influenced the history of books and the religious landscape. And what a
500-year-old volume can still reveal.</p>
<p>What is a Gutenberg Bible?</p>
<p>The term refers to each of the two-volume Bibles printed in
Gutenberg’s workshop around 1454.</p>
<p>Before that, all existing Bibles were copied by hand. The process
could take up to a year, said John McQuillen, associate curator at the
Morgan Library. In contrast, it is believed that Gutenberg completed his
work in about six months.</p>
<p>Each Gutenberg Bible has nearly 1,300 pages and weighs around 60
pounds. It’s written in Latin and printed in double columns, with 42
lines per page.</p>
<p>Most were printed on paper. A few others on animal skin.</p>
<p>When a Bible came off the press, only the black letters were printed.
Hand decorations and bindings were added later, depending on each
buyer’s taste and budget.</p>
<p>Some ornamentations were added in Germany. Others in France, Belgium
or Spain.</p>
<p>Therefore, each Gutenberg Bible is unique, McQuillen said.</p>
<p>Why were these Bibles a turning point?</p>
<p>Gutenberg’s invention produced a massive multiplication of complete
copies of biblical texts.</p>
<p>The first impact was among scholars and learned priests who had
easier access than ever before, said Richard Rex, professor of
Reformation History from the University of Cambridge.</p>
<p>“This massive multiplication even led to the wider adoption of the
term ‘Bible’ (Biblia) to describe the book,” Rex said. “Medieval authors
and others do speak sometimes of ‘the Bible’, but more commonly of
‘scripture.’”</p>
<p>Psychologically, Rex said, the appearance of the printed text — its
regularity, precision and uniformity — contributed to a tendency to
resolve theological arguments by reference to the biblical text
alone.</p>
<p>Later on, the printing of Bibles in vernacular languages — especially
from Luther’s Bible (early 1520s) and Tyndale’s New Testament (mid
1520s) onwards — affected the way that ordinary parishioners related to
religion and the clergy.</p>
<p>The limits of literacy still meant that access to the Bible was far
from universal. Gradually, though, religious leaders stopped being its
main interpreters.</p>
<p>“The phenomenon of lay people questioning or interpreting the
biblical text became more common from the 1520s onwards,” Rex said.
“Although the early Protestant Reformers, such as Luther, emphasized
that they did not seek to create an interpretative ‘free for all,’ this
was probably the predictable consequence of their appeal to ‘scripture
alone.’”</p>
<p>More than a book</p>
<p>Three times per year, a curator from the Morgan Library turns the
page of the Gutenberg Bible on display. It’s leaves not only tell a tale
of scripture, but of those who possessed it.</p>
<p>A few years ago, by studying its handmade initials, McQuillen was the
one to figure out the origin of its decoration: a German monastery that
no longer exists.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the 2000s, a Japanese researcher found little marks on
the surface of the Old Testament’s paper copy. Her findings revealed
that those leaves were used by Gutenberg’s successors for their own
edition, printed in 1462.</p>
<p>“For as many times as the Gutenberg Bible have been looked at, it
seems like every time a researcher comes in, something new can be
discovered,” McQuillen said.</p>
<p>“This book has existed for 500 years. Who are the people that have
touched it? How can we talk about these personal histories in addition
to the greater idea of what printing technology means on a European or
global scale?” he said.</p>
<p>Among the thousands of Bibles that J. P. Morgan acquired, owners made
various annotations. Individual names, birth dates, details that reflect
a personal story.</p>
<p>“A Bible is now sort of a book on the shelf,” McQuillen said. “But at
one point, this was a very personal object.”</p>
<p>“In a museum setting, they become art and a little bit distanced, but
we try to break that distance down.”</p>

We spent all of June cruising through Southeast Alaska, we visited 4
cities and stopped by 14 different anchorages. On June 27th, 420
nautical miles later, we arrived in the beautiful town of Sitka — our
favorite city so far.
</p>
<p>
We have sailed as far north as we are willing to go this year, at 57°N —
the same latitude as Kodiak. Sailing in these waters has been
challenging, there is a lot of current, and the wind is often light, or
absent. Because of these frequent calms,
<a href="https://100r.co/site/engine_care.html" target="_blank">Calcifer
II</a> has seen a lot of use this year. We will now slowly make our way
back south, exploring new anchorages along the west coast of Southeast
Alaska all the while. We continue to update our path in Alaska
<a href="https://100r.co/site/us_se_alaska.html" target="_blank">here</a>,
when we cross back into Canada we’ll resume updates

<h2 id="everything-is-freeware">Everything is freeware</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-29, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;blockquote&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
I think that with respect to content that’s already on the open web, the
social contract of that content since the ’90s has been that it is fair
use. Anyone can copy it, recreate with it, reproduce with it. That has
been “freeware,” if you like, that’s been the understanding.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Microsoft AI CEO—how many CEOs does Microsoft need?—Mustafa Suleyman
sure has an
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/28/24188391/microsoft-ai-suleyman-social-contract-freeware">interesting
take</a> on the web. I guess all the people sailing the high seas feel
vindicated now. I mean, he said it: content that’s already on the open
web is fair use if you want to copy it. I’m sure this is exactly what he
meant and I’m definitely not misinterpreting what he’s saying. After
all, all these companies are trying hard to follow both the literal and
also the spirit of the laws so it’s only fair for me to try hard to not
misinterpret their views am I right?
</p>
<p>
I also love that he used the term freeware and not free. Because the
wiki definition of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeware">Freeware</a> reads:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
There is no agreed-upon set of rights, license, or EULA that defines
freeware unambiguously; every publisher defines its own rules for the
freeware it offers. For instance, modification, redistribution by third
parties, and reverse engineering are permitted by some publishers but
prohibited by others.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
So not only he spouted a bunch of garbage bullshit but he also used the
perfectly wrong term. Hey, maybe he’s just running GPT in the background
and he was just hallucinating. Always a possibility.

id="if-your-immutable-linux-desktop-uses-flatpak-im-going-to-have-a-bad-time">If
your immutable Linux desktop uses Flatpak, I’m going to have a bad
time</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-29, from: OS News</p>
<p>The openSUSE project recently announced the second release candidate
(RC2) of its Aeon Desktop, formerly known as MicroOS Desktop GNOME.
Aside from the new coat of naming paint, Aeon breaks ground in a few
other ways by dabbling with technologies not found in other openSUSE
releases. The goal for Aeon is to provide automated system updates using
snapshots that can be applied atomically, removing the burden of system
maintenance for “lazy developers” who want to focus on their work rather
than desktop administration. System-tinkerers need not apply. The idea
behind Aeon, as with other immutable (or image-based) Linux
distributions, is to provide the core of the distribution as a read-only
image or filesystem that is updated atomically and can be rolled back if
needed. Google’s ChromeOS was the first popular Linux-based desktop
operating system to follow this model. Since the release of ChromeOS a
number of interesting immutable implementations have cropped up, such as
Fedora Silverblue, Project Bluefin (covered here in December 2023),
openSUSE’s MicroOS (covered here in March 2023), and Ubuntu Core. ↫ Joe
Brockmeier at LWN With the amount of attention immutable Linux desktops
are getting, and how much work and experimentation that’s going into
them, I’m getting the feeling that sooner or later all of the major,
popular desktop Linux distributions will be going this route. Depending
on implementation details, I actually like the concept of a defined base
system that’s just an image that can be replaced easily using btrfs
snapshots or something like that, while all the user’s files and
customisations are kept elsewhere. It makes intuitive sense. Where the
current crop of immutable Linux desktops fall flat for me is their
reliance on (usually) Flatpak. You know how there’s people who hate
systemd and/or Wayland just a little too much, to the point it gets a
little weird and worrying? That’s me whenever I have to deal with
Flatpaks. Every experience I have with Flatpaks is riddled with trouble
for me. Even though I’m a KDE user, I’m currently testing out the latest
GNOME release on my workstation (the one that I used to conclude Windows
is simply not ready for the desktop), using Fedora of course, and on
GNOME I use the Mastodon application Tuba. While I mostly write in
English, I do occasionally write in Dutch, too, and would love for the
spell check feature to work in my native tongue, too, instead of just in
English. However, despite having all possible Dutch dictionaries
installed – hunspell, aspell – and despite those dictionaries being
picked up everywhere else in GNOME, Tuba only showed me a long list of
variants of English. After digging around to find out why this was
happening, it took me far longer than I care to publicly admit to
realise that since the latest version of Tuba is only really available
as a Flatpak on Fedora, my problem probably had something to do with
that – and it turns out I was right: Flatpak applications do not use the
system-wide installed spellcheck dictionaries like normal applications
do. This eventually led me to this article by Daniel Aleksandersen,
where he details what you need to do in order to add spellcheck
dictionaries to Flatpak applications. You need to run the following
commands: The list of languages uses two-letter codes only, and the
first language listed will serve as the display language for Flatpak
applications, while the rest will be fallback languages – which happens
to include downloading and installing the Flatpak-specific copies of the
spellcheck libraries. Sadly, this method is not particularly granular.
Since it only accepts the two-letter codes, you can’t, say, only install
“nl-nl”; you’ll be getting “nl-be” as well. In the case of a widely
spoken language like English, this means a massive list of 18 different
varieties of English. The resulting menus are… Not elegant. This is just
an example, but using Flatpak, you’ll run into all kinds of issues like
this, that then have to be solved by hacks or obscure terminal commands
– not exactly the user-friendly image Flatpak is trying to convey to the
world. This particular issue might not matter to the probably
overwhelming English-speaking majority of Flatpak developers, but for
anyone who has to deal with multiple languages on a daily basis – which
is a massive number of people, probably well over 50% of computer users
– having to mess around with obscure terminal commands hidden in blog
posts just to be able to use the languages they use every day is
terrible design on a multitude of levels, and will outright make Flatpak
applications unusable for large numbers of people. Whenever I run into
these Flatpak problems, it makes it clear to me that Flatpak is designed
not by users, for users – but by developers, for developers. I can
totally understand and see why Flatpak is appealing to developers, but
as a user, they bring me nothing but grief, issues, and weird bugs that
all seem to stem from being made to make developers’ lives easier,
instead of users’. If immutable Linux distributions are really hellbent
on using Flatpak as the the means of application installation – and it
seams like they are – it will mean a massive regression in
functionality, usability, and discoverability for users, and as long as
Flatpak remains as broken and badly designed as it is, I really see no
reason to recommend an immutable Linux desktop to anyone but the really
curious among us.</p>
