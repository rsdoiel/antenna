## The New DVD Bargain Bin

A major studio is apparently treating YouTube as a place to drop some of its archive films that have lost their cinematic luster. My mind is admittedly blown.

## An Open Letter to the Old Man Who Bartered with My Cancer-Patient Daughter at the Community Yard Sale Fundraiser

date: 2025-02-05, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p>Dear Old Man Who Bartered with My Cancer-Patient Daughter at the Community Yard Sale Fundraiser,</p> <p>Thank you for attending the Alex&#8217;s Lemonade Stand community yard sale last Saturday. By “attending,” of course, I mean “looming over my ten-year-old daughter’s card table and haggling over the price of a sequined stuffed seal as if your Social Security payments depended on it.”</p> <p>I imagine you saw the sign: <small><span class="caps">ALL</span> <span class="caps">PROCEEDS</span> <span class="caps">DONATED</span> TO <span class="caps">CHARITY</span></small>. The one my daughter painted with her one good hand while still hooked to a chemo pump like she’s the saddest science experiment ever.</p> <p>Or maybe you noticed the giant cardboard cutout of her: bald head gleaming and feeding tube affixed to her nose like a fashion accessory from the Underworld’s spring/summer collection. The only thing better than having cancer is reminding the whole goddamn neighborhood about it with oversized props.</p> <p>The table was covered with donated items: books, knickknacks, toys. Nothing priced over five dollars. This wasn’t Sotheby’s. This wasn’t even Goodwill. And yet, you, a grown man (and card-carrying member of <span class="caps">AARP</span> by my estimation) clutched a sequined stuffed seal like it was the Hope Diamond, and asked if I could knock it down from two dollars to one dollar.</p> <p>You saw a child with cancer sitting next to a sign that screamed, “All this money will help kids like me <i>not die</i>,” and you thought, <i>I think I’ll argue over the price of a mismatched salt shaker set</i>.</p> <p>When you woke up that morning and decided to show your face in public, did you think, <i>You know what today needs? A child with cancer being forced to justify her pricing structure to me.</i></p> <p>What is it that makes a functioning adult man look at a feeding tube and think, <i>Ah, but what about my bottom line?</i></p> <p>What were you going to do with that dollar you saved? Put it toward your retirement? Buy a hot dog at the Costco food court? Have you been saving up for a six-dollar latte, and my daughter&#8217;s blood cancer was in the way of your pumpkin spice destiny?</p> <p>Or was it about <i>principle</i>? Were you staging a stand against price gouging at pediatric cancer fundraisers? History will not remember you as its hero. There will be no documentaries called <i>The Man Who Saved Fifty Cents from Big Charity</i>.</p> <p>Don’t think I didn’t notice your wife trying to disappear into the bushes. She was shaking her head like she was trying to clear a swarm of bees, mouthing, <i>I don’t even like him!</i></p> <p>You stood there wearing cargo shorts with about sixteen functional pockets and an aggressive cologne and thought, <i>These kids may be sick, but I still need to save a dollar so I can afford the early-bird special at <span class="caps">IHOP</span>.</i> Do pancakes taste better after you make a bald child explain, “No, sir, the three-dollar stained-glass coaster set is not negotiable”?</p> <p>I hope that sequined stuffed seal becomes a cursed object in your life. Its beady gaze will follow you around your house. Your granddaughter will pick it up, stare into the teal galaxies of its plastic eyes, and say, &#8220;Grandpa, this is the saddest toy I&#8217;ve ever seen. Did a dying kid give this to you?&#8221;</p> <p>May the little gently used seal appear in your dreams. May it show up in strange places around your house: the bathroom mirror, your car dashboard, the freezer next to your generic-brand frozen waffles&#8212;its flip sequins spelling out: <small><span class="caps">ALL</span> <span class="caps">PROCEEDS</span> <span class="caps">COULD</span> <span class="caps">HAVE</span> <span class="caps">GONE</span> TO <span class="caps">KIDS</span> <span class="caps">WITH</span> <span class="caps">CANCER</span>, <span class="caps">YOU</span> <span class="caps">SELFISH</span> <span class="caps">PRICK</span></small>.</p> <p>One day, when you shuffle off this mortal coil and stare into the abyss of whatever budget-tier afterlife awaits you, that fucking sequined seal will be there waiting. I hope it waddles up, its eyes sparkling teal and orange in the flames, and squeaks out, “Remember me, asshole?”</p> <p>Back here in the mortal world, on the funeral home’s memorial page, I hope your family adds a link at the end of your obituary for people to make a donation to Alex’s Lemonade Stand in your dishonor.</p> <p>Sincerely,<br /> Elizabeth Austin (The Mom Hosting the &#8220;Kick a Cheap Old Man for Charity&#8221; Booth at This Year’s Community Yard Sale Fundraiser)</p>

## o3-mini is really good at writing internal documentation

date: 2025-02-05, updated: 2025-02-05, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/4a13c4b10176d7b8e3d1260f5dcc9de3">o3-mini is really good at writing internal documentation</a></strong></p>
I wanted to refresh my knowledge of how the Datasette permissions system works today. I already have <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/authentication.html">extensive hand-written documentation</a> for that, but I thought it would be interesting to see if I could derive any insights from running an LLM against the codebase.</p>
<p>o3-mini has an input limit of 200,000 tokens. I used <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> and my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/files-to-prompt">files-to-prompt</a> tool to generate the documentation like this:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre><span class="pl-c1">cd</span> /tmp
git clone https://github.com/simonw/datasette
<span class="pl-c1">cd</span> datasette
files-to-prompt datasette -e py -c <span class="pl-k">|</span> \
  llm -m o3-mini -s \
  <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>write extensive documentation for how the permissions system works, as markdown<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre></div>

<p>The <code>files-to-prompt</code> command is fed the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/tree/main/datasette">datasette</a> subdirectory, which contains just the source code for the application - omitting tests (in <code>tests/</code>) and documentation (in <code>docs/</code>).</p>
<p>The <code>-e py</code> option causes it to only include files with a <code>.py</code> extension - skipping all of the HTML and JavaScript files in that hierarchy.</p>
<p>The <code>-c</code> option causes it to output Claude's XML-ish format - a format that works great with other LLMs too.</p>
<p>You can see the output of that command <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/1922544763b08c76f0b904e2ece364ea">in this Gist</a>.</p>
<p>Then I pipe that result into LLM, requesting the <code>o3-mini</code> OpenAI model and passing the following system prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>write extensive documentation for how the permissions system works, as markdown</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Specifically requesting Markdown <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/2/openai-reasoning-models-advice-on-prompting/">is important</a>.</p>
<p>The prompt used 99,348 input tokens and produced 3,118 output tokens (320 of those were invisible reasoning tokens). That's <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/llm-prices">a cost</a> of 12.3 cents.</p>
<p>Honestly, <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/4a13c4b10176d7b8e3d1260f5dcc9de3">the results</a> are fantastic. I had to double-check that I hadn't accidentally fed in the documentation by mistake.</p>
<p>(It's possible that the model is picking up additional information about Datasette in its training set, but I've seen similar <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/adf64108d65cd5c10ac9fce953ab437e">high quality results</a> from other, newer libraries so I don't think that's a significant factor.)</p>
<p>In this case I already had extensive written documentation of my own, but this was still a useful refresher to help confirm that the code matched my mental model of how everything works.</p>
<p>Documentation of project internals as a category is notorious for going out of date. Having tricks like this to derive usable how-it-works documentation from existing codebases in just a few seconds and at a cost of a few cents is wildly valuable.

Instapaper: On Instapaper iOS and macOS, you can now sign in to websites directly within the app. When you&#8217;re logged into sites, Instapaper can more reliably retrieve and display complete articles. Increasingly, we&#8217;re seeing more &#8220;hard paywalls&#8221; across the Internet, where publishers are preventing third parties from accessing content. Sometimes, this results in Instapaper only [&#8230;]

## Ambsheets: Spreadsheets for exploring scenarios

date: 2025-02-05, updated: 2025-02-05, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/ambsheets/">Ambsheets: Spreadsheets for exploring scenarios</a></strong></p>
Delightful UI experiment by Alex Warth and Geoffrey Litt at Ink &amp; Switch, exploring the idea of a spreadsheet with cells that can handle multiple values at once, which they call "amb" (for "ambiguous") values. A single sheet can then be used to model multiple scenarios.</p>
<p>Here the cell for "Car" contains <code>{500, 1200}</code> and the cell for "Apartment"  contains <code>{2800, 3700, 5500}</code>, resulting in a "Total" cell with six different values. Hovering over a calculated highlights its source values and a side panel shows a table of calculated results against those different combinations.</p>
<p><img alt="Spreadsheet showing budget items with values in cells: Column A shows Budget, Car, Apartment, Netflix, and TOTAL. Column B shows values including x̄ = 850 for Car with values 500 and 1,200; x̄ = 4,000 for Apartment with values 2,800, 3,700, and 5,500; Netflix shows 18; TOTAL row shows x̄ = 4,868 with values 3,318, 4,218, 6,018, 4,018, 4,918, and 6,718. Right side shows formula =sum(b3:b5), TABLE with aggregate avg dropdown, and STACKS visualization of the values." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/amb-sheets.jpg" /></p>
<p>Always interesting to see neat ideas like this presented on top of UIs that haven't had a significant upgrade in a very long time.

## AI-generated slop is already in your public library

date: 2025-02-05, updated: 2025-02-05, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://www.404media.co/ai-generated-slop-is-already-in-your-public-library-3/">AI-generated slop is already in your public library</a></strong></p>
US libraries that use the <a href="https://www.hoopladigital.com/">Hoopla</a> system to offer ebooks to their patrons sign agreements where they pay a license fee for anything selected by one of their members that's in the Hoopla catalog.</p>
<p>The Hoopla catalog is increasingly filling up with junk AI slop ebooks like "Fatty Liver Diet Cookbook: 2000 Days of Simple and Flavorful Recipes for a Revitalized Liver", which then cost libraries money if someone checks them out.</p>
<p>Apparently librarians already have a term for this kind of low-quality, low effort content that predates it being written by LLMs: vendor slurry.</p>
<p>Libraries stand against censorship, making this a difficult issue to address through removing those listings. </p>
<p>Sarah Lamdan, deputy director of the American Library Association says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If library visitors choose to read AI eBooks, they should do so with the knowledge that the books are AI-generated.</p>

## Animating Rick and Morty One Pixel at a Time

date: 2025-02-04, updated: 2025-02-04, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/code-animated-rick/">Animating Rick and Morty One Pixel at a Time</a></strong></p>
Daniel Hooper says he spent 8 months working on the post, the culmination of which is an animation of Rick from Rick and Morty, implemented in 240 lines of GLSL - the OpenGL Shading Language which apparently has been directly supported by browsers for many years.</p>
<p>The result is a comprehensive GLSL tutorial, complete with interactive examples of each of the steps used to generate the final animation which you can tinker with directly on the page. It feels a bit like Logo!</p>
<p><img alt="Animated demo - as I edit the shader code Rick's half-drawn eye pupils move from side to side live with my edits" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/rick-edit.gif" /></p>
<p>Shaders work by running code for each pixel to return that pixel's color - in this case the <code>color_for_pixel()</code> function is wired up as the core logic of the shader.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/danielchasehooper/72da5d9c286e5e94fdfb8e82bea288cc">Daniel's code for the live shader editor</a> he built for this post.

## Oracle justified its JavaScript trademark with Node.js—now it wants that ignored

## Call for Blog Carnival 23: Digital Circulation in Rhetoric and Writing Studies

date: 2025-02-04, from: Digital Humanities Quarterly News

For much of rhetoric’s history, circulation—the cultural and spatio-temporal flow of texts, ideas, and images through various networks, platforms, and structures—has been less of an explicit area of study and more of an “assumed phenomenon” (Gries, 2018, p. 3) running through the field. However, since the digital turn, our focus on computers, algorithms, and digital [...]

## If Crooks Were Studying My Every Move to Pull an Ocean’s 11–Style Heist on Me

date: 2025-02-04, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p>“Good morning, boss.”</p> <p>“Mornin’, Sneaky Matt. They tell me you’re the one’s been tailing our mark for the last month, is that right?”</p> <p>“That’s right, sir.”</p> <p>“Studyin’ his moves and whatnot, stickin’ to him like white on rice and so forth, is that right, Sneaky Matt?”</p> <p>“It’s Sneaky Matthew, but yes, sir.”</p> <p>“That’s real good, Sneaky Matthew. I hear this guy&#8217;s a <i>machine</i> of efficiency and routine. I want to know everything; when he sleeps, when he eats, when he yawns&#8212;the guy so much as closes his eyes when he farts <i>we need to know about it.</i>”</p> <p>“Yes, sir.”</p> <p>“It’s these rare moments of carelessness that we need. If we’re lucky, our window will be open <i>just long enough</i> to make our move and pull off the heist of the century! But only when he’s indisposed.”</p> <p>“I understand the plan, sir.”</p> <p>“It’s when he’s otherwise occupied by his daily routine that we strike.”</p> <p>“Sir.”</p> <p>“All right, Sneaky Matthew. Tell me about this guy, this <i>machine</i>. When does this high-level operator take a break, give me every detail.”</p> <p>“At exactly 5:59 a.m. his alarm goes off, every day.”</p> <p>“Even on <i>weekends</i>?”</p> <p>“Every single day.”</p> <p>“So it’s true. The man <i>is</i> a machine.”</p> <p>“Well, the alarm goes off. Somedays, he gets up, somedays he’ll hit snooze once and then get up, somedays he’ll hit snooze every nine minutes for like an hour. On Sundays, he just turns it off the second it wakes him and falls back asleep.”</p> <p>“Does he know you can program alarms to not go off on Sundays?”</p> <p>“Shall I continue?”</p> <p>“Yes, of course, sorry. I’m sure the sleep-snooze issue increases his brain capabilities. Some advanced-level stuff that we couldn’t even comprehend. They say da Vinci used to take micro naps, you know? Genius stuff. We don’t need to know <i>how</i> it works, we just need to know his every move.”</p> <p>“Right. So he gets up and sets his coffee maker to make his first cup of coffee of the day. While it’s brewing he takes his dog and walks exactly twenty steps to the left while his dog does his business. By the time the dog’s done, the coffee is ready.”</p> <p>“And he keeps his eye on the front door the whole time. Smart. All right, what else?”</p> <p>“He drinks his coffee and checks the <i>Times</i>.”</p> <p>“<i>New York</i>? <i>LA</i>? Both?”</p> <p>“Sorry, the <i>Times</i> app. Wordle, Spelling Bee, Connections. The Crossword, but never after Wednesday.”</p> <p>“Ah, yes, because after Wednesday…?”</p> <p>“Puzzle’s too hard for him.”</p> <p>“Oh. Even <i>Thursday’s</i> too hard?”</p> <p>“Continuing: Every morning between 7:22 and 7:38 a.m., he sprints to the bathroom to <i>relieve himself</i> for roughly twelve minutes.”</p> <p>“Amazing, he even <span class="caps">SHITS</span> like <i>clockwork</i>! He—wait, you say he <i>sprints</i>?”</p> <p>“Yes. The… defecation itself happens with remarkable consistency, but it somehow always seems to catch him by surprise.”</p> <p>“Huh.”</p> <p>“Yeah. There’s not a lot to say about it.”</p> <p>“Okay.”</p> <p>“After that, he has a protein bar for breakfast and typically goes for a six-mile run.”</p> <p>“A health nut. Impressive.”</p> <p>“Unless it’s raining, windy, too cold, or too hot.”</p> <p>“So… on average… <i>ballpark</i>, would you say—”</p> <p>“Roughly 1.5 times per month he runs.”</p> <p>“Less impressive.”</p> <p>“When he returns, he makes the exact same salad for lunch: greens, pomegranate seeds, chicken, and plant-based cheese, no dressing. Lean, healthy. That is what he eats when his wife is working from home.”</p> <p>“And when she’s not?”</p> <p>“He eats two pickles out of a jar and a half-sleeve of birthday-cake-flavored Oreos he keeps hidden in a cabinet his wife can’t reach.”</p> <p>“They make birthday-cake-flavored Oreos?”</p> <p>“You have to order them.”</p> <p>“Christ. And the pickles?”</p> <p>“My assumption is that he thinks, <i>Green, that counts as salad.</i>”</p> <p>“No—I mean, sure, I just meant the combination. What time is it at this point?”</p> <p>“12:10.”</p> <p>“You haven’t mentioned him brushing his teeth yet.”</p> <p>“No, sir, I have not.”</p> <p>“Coffee, protein bar…”</p> <p>“Pickles and birthday cookie.”</p> <p>“Woof.”</p> <p>“If his wife’s home, he’ll read or do vague internet scrolling, and if she’s out, he tries on a bunch of outfits he’s already worn, or he takes his shirt off and practices bass guitar in the mirror. He plays around with tabs on YouTube, but it’s mostly &#8216;Hot to Go!&#8217;”</p> <p>“A musician. Is he&#8230;?”</p> <p>“I don’t want to be rude. I’ll say he’s not interested in <i>improving</i>. So. It seems like he must know what he wants to get out of the whole… thing. After that, some days he goes to the gym—”</p> <p>“A run and the gym on the same day, what a—sorry, on days that he runs, has he showered yet at this point?”</p> <p>“No, he changes out of the sweaty clothes into other clothes. He’s pretty confident that as long as he’s dry he’s not dirty anymore. It seems to be a real source of tension between him and the wife.”</p> <p>“I can imagine.”</p> <p>“Continuing, some days he goes to the gym, some days he gets dressed <i>for</i> the gym but just drives around listening to either &#8216;Hot To Go!&#8217; or podcasts about wrestling.”</p> <p>“Gosh, he really likes that song.”</p> <p>“He’s home every day at exactly 5:13, except for the days when he gets home several hours before or after that, depending on—I mean, it depends. He goes to a midday movie, goes to a bar. Target, spends a lot of time at Target.”</p> <p>“Goddammit. He’s got us beat, this guy. Don’t you see? It’s <i>genius</i>! His erratic schedule, the unpredictability, the lack of consistency—it <i>seems</i> like chaos because to us it IS! But to him? A controlled chaos. A consistent inconsistency, a pattern only he understands. It makes him impossible to plan around, impossible to stay one step ahead of! The bastard’s got us beat. You can’t rob what you can’t track.
