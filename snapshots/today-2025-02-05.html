Open Letter to the Old Man Who Bartered with My Cancer-Patient Daughter
at the Community Yard Sale Fundraiser</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, from: McSweeney’s Internet Tendency</p>
<p>
Dear Old Man Who Bartered with My Cancer-Patient Daughter at the
Community Yard Sale Fundraiser,
</p>
<p>
Thank you for attending the Alex’s Lemonade Stand community yard sale
last Saturday. By “attending,” of course, I mean “looming over my
ten-year-old daughter’s card table and haggling over the price of a
sequined stuffed seal as if your Social Security payments depended on
it.”
</p>
<p>
I imagine you saw the sign: <small><span class="caps">ALL</span> <span
class="caps">PROCEEDS</span> <span class="caps">DONATED</span> TO <span
class="caps">CHARITY</span></small>. The one my daughter painted with
her one good hand while still hooked to a chemo pump like she’s the
saddest science experiment ever.
</p>
<p>
Or maybe you noticed the giant cardboard cutout of her: bald head
gleaming and feeding tube affixed to her nose like a fashion accessory
from the Underworld’s spring/summer collection. The only thing better
than having cancer is reminding the whole goddamn neighborhood about it
with oversized props.
</p>
<p>
The table was covered with donated items: books, knickknacks, toys.
Nothing priced over five dollars. This wasn’t Sotheby’s. This wasn’t
even Goodwill. And yet, you, a grown man (and card-carrying member of
<span class="caps">AARP</span> by my estimation) clutched a sequined
stuffed seal like it was the Hope Diamond, and asked if I could knock it
down from two dollars to one dollar.
</p>
<p>
You saw a child with cancer sitting next to a sign that screamed, “All
this money will help kids like me <i>not die</i>,” and you thought, <i>I
think I’ll argue over the price of a mismatched salt shaker set</i>.
</p>
<p>
When you woke up that morning and decided to show your face in public,
did you think, <i>You know what today needs? A child with cancer being
forced to justify her pricing structure to me.</i>
</p>
<p>
What is it that makes a functioning adult man look at a feeding tube and
think, <i>Ah, but what about my bottom line?</i>
</p>
<p>
What were you going to do with that dollar you saved? Put it toward your
retirement? Buy a hot dog at the Costco food court? Have you been saving
up for a six-dollar latte, and my daughter’s blood cancer was in the way
of your pumpkin spice destiny?
</p>
<p>
Or was it about <i>principle</i>? Were you staging a stand against price
gouging at pediatric cancer fundraisers? History will not remember you
as its hero. There will be no documentaries called <i>The Man Who Saved
Fifty Cents from Big Charity</i>.
</p>
<p>
Don’t think I didn’t notice your wife trying to disappear into the
bushes. She was shaking her head like she was trying to clear a swarm of
bees, mouthing, <i>I don’t even like him!</i>
</p>
<p>
You stood there wearing cargo shorts with about sixteen functional
pockets and an aggressive cologne and thought, <i>These kids may be
sick, but I still need to save a dollar so I can afford the early-bird
special at <span class="caps">IHOP</span>.</i> Do pancakes taste better
after you make a bald child explain, “No, sir, the three-dollar
stained-glass coaster set is not negotiable”?
</p>
<p>
I hope that sequined stuffed seal becomes a cursed object in your life.
Its beady gaze will follow you around your house. Your granddaughter
will pick it up, stare into the teal galaxies of its plastic eyes, and
say, “Grandpa, this is the saddest toy I’ve ever seen. Did a dying kid
give this to you?”
</p>
<p>
May the little gently used seal appear in your dreams. May it show up in
strange places around your house: the bathroom mirror, your car
dashboard, the freezer next to your generic-brand frozen waffles—its
flip sequins spelling out: <small><span class="caps">ALL</span> <span
class="caps">PROCEEDS</span> <span class="caps">COULD</span> <span
class="caps">HAVE</span> <span class="caps">GONE</span> TO <span
class="caps">KIDS</span> <span class="caps">WITH</span> <span
class="caps">CANCER</span>, <span class="caps">YOU</span> <span
class="caps">SELFISH</span> <span class="caps">PRICK</span></small>.
</p>
<p>
One day, when you shuffle off this mortal coil and stare into the abyss
of whatever budget-tier afterlife awaits you, that fucking sequined seal
will be there waiting. I hope it waddles up, its eyes sparkling teal and
orange in the flames, and squeaks out, “Remember me, asshole?”
</p>
<p>
Back here in the mortal world, on the funeral home’s memorial page, I
hope your family adds a link at the end of your obituary for people to
make a donation to Alex’s Lemonade Stand in your dishonor.
</p>
<p>
Sincerely,<br /> Elizabeth Austin (The Mom Hosting the “Kick a Cheap Old
Man for Charity” Booth at This Year’s Community Yard Sale Fundraiser)

Last I checked, coups were already illegal. Don’t need to protest. Don’t
need to draft lawsuits or new laws. You need physical enforcement.
</p>
<p>
If the people with that job are already choosing the side of the coup,
you are at the crisis point. Denying access to federal buildings to
members of Congress but not private citizens is a clear sign. Peaceful
protest will lose you the country.

id="o3-mini-is-really-good-at-writing-internal-documentation">o3-mini is
really good at writing internal documentation</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-05, updated: 2025-02-05, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/4a13c4b10176d7b8e3d1260f5dcc9de3">o3-mini
is really good at writing internal documentation</a></strong>
</p>
I wanted to refresh my knowledge of how the Datasette permissions system
works today. I already have
<a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/authentication.html">extensive
hand-written documentation</a> for that, but I thought it would be
interesting to see if I could derive any insights from running an LLM
against the codebase.
</p>
<p>
o3-mini has an input limit of 200,000 tokens. I used
<a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> and my
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/files-to-prompt">files-to-prompt</a>
tool to generate the documentation like this:
</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
<pre><span class="pl-c1">cd</span> /tmp
git clone https://github.com/simonw/datasette
<span class="pl-c1">cd</span> datasette
files-to-prompt datasette -e py -c <span class="pl-k">|</span> \
  llm -m o3-mini -s \
  <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>write extensive documentation for how the permissions system works, as markdown<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre>
</div>
<p>
The <code>files-to-prompt</code> command is fed the
<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/tree/main/datasette">datasette</a>
subdirectory, which contains just the source code for the application -
omitting tests (in <code>tests/</code>) and documentation (in
<code>docs/</code>).
</p>
<p>
The <code>-e py</code> option causes it to only include files with a
<code>.py</code> extension - skipping all of the HTML and JavaScript
files in that hierarchy.
</p>
<p>
The <code>-c</code> option causes it to output Claude’s XML-ish format -
a format that works great with other LLMs too.
</p>
<p>
You can see the output of that command
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/1922544763b08c76f0b904e2ece364ea">in
this Gist</a>.
</p>
<p>
Then I pipe that result into LLM, requesting the <code>o3-mini</code>
OpenAI model and passing the following system prompt:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>write extensive documentation for how the permissions system
works, as markdown</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Specifically requesting Markdown
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/2/openai-reasoning-models-advice-on-prompting/">is
important</a>.
</p>
<p>
The prompt used 99,348 input tokens and produced 3,118 output tokens
(320 of those were invisible reasoning tokens). That’s
<a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/llm-prices">a cost</a> of 12.3
cents.
</p>
<p>
Honestly,
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/4a13c4b10176d7b8e3d1260f5dcc9de3">the
results</a> are fantastic. I had to double-check that I hadn’t
accidentally fed in the documentation by mistake.
</p>
<p>
(It’s possible that the model is picking up additional information about
Datasette in its training set, but I’ve seen similar
<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/adf64108d65cd5c10ac9fce953ab437e">high
quality results</a> from other, newer libraries so I don’t think that’s
a significant factor.)
</p>
<p>
In this case I already had extensive written documentation of my own,
but this was still a useful refresher to help confirm that the code
matched my mental model of how everything works.
</p>
<p>
<p>Documentation of project internals as a category is notorious for
going out of date. Having tricks like this to derive usable how-it-works
documentation from existing codebases in just a few seconds and at a
cost of a few cents is wildly valuable.</p>

<strong><a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/ambsheets/">Ambsheets:
Spreadsheets for exploring scenarios</a></strong>
</p>
Delightful UI experiment by Alex Warth and Geoffrey Litt at Ink &amp;
Switch, exploring the idea of a spreadsheet with cells that can handle
multiple values at once, which they call “amb” (for “ambiguous”) values.
A single sheet can then be used to model multiple scenarios.
</p>
<p>
Here the cell for “Car” contains <code>{500, 1200}</code> and the cell
for “Apartment” contains <code>{2800, 3700, 5500}</code>, resulting in a
“Total” cell with six different values. Hovering over a calculated
highlights its source values and a side panel shows a table of
calculated results against those different combinations.
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Spreadsheet showing budget items with values in cells: Column A shows Budget, Car, Apartment, Netflix, and TOTAL. Column B shows values including x̄ = 850 for Car with values 500 and 1,200; x̄ = 4,000 for Apartment with values 2,800, 3,700, and 5,500; Netflix shows 18; TOTAL row shows x̄ = 4,868 with values 3,318, 4,218, 6,018, 4,018, 4,918, and 6,718.

<p>Always interesting to see neat ideas like this presented on top of
UIs that haven’t had a significant upgrade in a very long time.</p>

like “Fatty Liver Diet Cookbook: 2000 Days of Simple and Flavorful
Recipes for a Revitalized Liver”, which then cost libraries money if
someone checks them out.
</p>
<p>
Apparently librarians already have a term for this kind of low-quality,
low effort content that predates it being written by LLMs: vendor
slurry.
</p>
<p>
Libraries stand against censorship, making this a difficult issue to
address through removing those listings.
</p>
<p>
Sarah Lamdan, deputy director of the American Library Association says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If library visitors choose to read AI eBooks, they should do so with the
knowledge that the books are AI-generated.

<h2 id="animating-rick-and-morty-one-pixel-at-a-time">Animating Rick and
Morty One Pixel at a Time</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, updated: 2025-02-04, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/code-animated-rick/">Animating
Rick and Morty One Pixel at a Time</a></strong>
</p>
Daniel Hooper says he spent 8 months working on the post, the
culmination of which is an animation of Rick from Rick and Morty,
implemented in 240 lines of GLSL - the OpenGL Shading Language which
apparently has been directly supported by browsers for many years.
</p>
<p>
The result is a comprehensive GLSL tutorial, complete with interactive
examples of each of the steps used to generate the final animation which
you can tinker with directly on the page. It feels a bit like Logo!
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Animated demo - as I edit the shader code Rick's half-drawn eye pupils move from side to side live with my edits" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/rick-edit.gif" />
</p>
<p>
Shaders work by running code for each pixel to return that pixel’s color
- in this case the <code>color_for_pixel()</code> function is wired up
as the core logic of the shader.
</p>
<p>
Here’s
<a href="https://gist.github.com/danielchasehooper/72da5d9c286e5e94fdfb8e82bea288cc">Daniel’s
code for the live shader editor</a> he built for this post. It looks

<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: National Archives, Text Message blog</p>
<p>In 1913 Philip Longergan, superintendent of the Pueblo day schools,
received a deal he couldn’t refuse. Even marked CONFIDENTIAL, adding
validity to just how great a deal it was, Longergan was entitled…to
purchase an A.G. Spalding and Brothers Incorporated All-Steel Apparatus
for the Playground…for 20% off! Today probably considered the same type
of junk mail …

<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: Digital Humanities Quarterly News</p>
For much of rhetoric’s history, circulation—the cultural and
spatio-temporal flow of texts, ideas, and images through various
networks, platforms, and structures—has been less of an explicit area of
study and more of an “assumed phenomenon” (Gries, 2018, p. 3) running
through the field. However, since the digital turn, our focus on
computers, algorithms, and digital […]

Crooks Were Studying My Every Move to Pull an Ocean’s 11–Style Heist on
Me</h2>
<p>date: 2025-02-04, from: McSweeney’s Internet Tendency</p>
<p>
“Good morning, boss.”
</p>
<p>
“Mornin’, Sneaky Matt. They tell me you’re the one’s been tailing our
mark for the last month, is that right?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s right, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Studyin’ his moves and whatnot, stickin’ to him like white on rice and
so forth, is that right, Sneaky Matt?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s Sneaky Matthew, but yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s real good, Sneaky Matthew. I hear this guy’s a <i>machine</i> of
efficiency and routine. I want to know everything; when he sleeps, when
he eats, when he yawns—the guy so much as closes his eyes when he farts
<i>we need to know about it.</i>”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s these rare moments of carelessness that we need. If we’re lucky,
our window will be open <i>just long enough</i> to make our move and
pull off the heist of the century! But only when he’s indisposed.”
</p>
<p>
“I understand the plan, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s when he’s otherwise occupied by his daily routine that we strike.”
</p>
<p>
“Sir.”
</p>
<p>
“All right, Sneaky Matthew. Tell me about this guy, this <i>machine</i>.
When does this high-level operator take a break, give me every detail.”
</p>
<p>
“At exactly 5:59 a.m. his alarm goes off, every day.”
</p>
<p>
“Even on <i>weekends</i>?”
</p>
<p>
“Every single day.”
</p>
<p>
“So it’s true. The man <i>is</i> a machine.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, the alarm goes off. Somedays, he gets up, somedays he’ll hit
snooze once and then get up, somedays he’ll hit snooze every nine
minutes for like an hour. On Sundays, he just turns it off the second it
wakes him and falls back asleep.”
</p>
<p>
“Does he know you can program alarms to not go off on Sundays?”
</p>
<p>
“Shall I continue?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, of course, sorry. I’m sure the sleep-snooze issue increases his
brain capabilities. Some advanced-level stuff that we couldn’t even
comprehend. They say da Vinci used to take micro naps, you know? Genius
stuff. We don’t need to know <i>how</i> it works, we just need to know
his every move.”
</p>
<p>
“Right. So he gets up and sets his coffee maker to make his first cup of
coffee of the day. While it’s brewing he takes his dog and walks exactly
twenty steps to the left while his dog does his business. By the time
the dog’s done, the coffee is ready.”
</p>
<p>
“And he keeps his eye on the front door the whole time. Smart. All
right, what else?”
</p>
<p>
“He drinks his coffee and checks the <i>Times</i>.”
</p>
<p>
“<i>New York</i>? <i>LA</i>? Both?”
</p>
<p>
“Sorry, the <i>Times</i> app. Wordle, Spelling Bee, Connections. The
Crossword, but never after Wednesday.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah, yes, because after Wednesday…?”
</p>
<p>
“Puzzle’s too hard for him.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh. Even <i>Thursday’s</i> too hard?”
</p>
<p>
“Continuing: Every morning between 7:22 and 7:38 a.m., he sprints to the
bathroom to <i>relieve himself</i> for roughly twelve minutes.”
</p>
<p>
“Amazing, he even <span class="caps">SHITS</span> like <i>clockwork</i>!
He—wait, you say he <i>sprints</i>?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. The… defecation itself happens with remarkable consistency, but it
somehow always seems to catch him by surprise.”
</p>
<p>
“Huh.”
</p>
<p>
“Yeah. There’s not a lot to say about it.”
</p>
<p>
“Okay.”
</p>
<p>
“After that, he has a protein bar for breakfast and typically goes for a
six-mile run.”
</p>
<p>
“A health nut. Impressive.”
</p>
<p>
“Unless it’s raining, windy, too cold, or too hot.”
</p>
<p>
“So… on average… <i>ballpark</i>, would you say—”
</p>
<p>
“Roughly 1.5 times per month he runs.”
</p>
<p>
“Less impressive.”
</p>
<p>
“When he returns, he makes the exact same salad for lunch: greens,
pomegranate seeds, chicken, and plant-based cheese, no dressing. Lean,
healthy. That is what he eats when his wife is working from home.”
</p>
<p>
“And when she’s not?”
</p>
<p>
“He eats two pickles out of a jar and a half-sleeve of
birthday-cake-flavored Oreos he keeps hidden in a cabinet his wife can’t
reach.”
</p>
<p>
“They make birthday-cake-flavored Oreos?”
</p>
<p>
“You have to order them.”
</p>
<p>
“Christ. And the pickles?”
</p>
<p>
“My assumption is that he thinks, <i>Green, that counts as salad.</i>”
</p>
<p>
“No—I mean, sure, I just meant the combination. What time is it at this
point?”
</p>
<p>
“12:10.”
</p>
<p>
“You haven’t mentioned him brushing his teeth yet.”
</p>
<p>
“No, sir, I have not.”
</p>
<p>
“Coffee, protein bar…”
</p>
<p>
“Pickles and birthday cookie.”
</p>
<p>
“Woof.”
</p>
<p>
“If his wife’s home, he’ll read or do vague internet scrolling, and if
she’s out, he tries on a bunch of outfits he’s already worn, or he takes
his shirt off and practices bass guitar in the mirror. He plays around
with tabs on YouTube, but it’s mostly ‘Hot to Go!’”
</p>
<p>
“A musician. Is he…?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want to be rude. I’ll say he’s not interested in
<i>improving</i>. So. It seems like he must know what he wants to get
out of the whole… thing. After that, some days he goes to the gym—”
</p>
<p>
“A run and the gym on the same day, what a—sorry, on days that he runs,
has he showered yet at this point?”
</p>
<p>
“No, he changes out of the sweaty clothes into other clothes. He’s
pretty confident that as long as he’s dry he’s not dirty anymore. It
seems to be a real source of tension between him and the wife.”
</p>
<p>
“I can imagine.”
</p>
<p>
“Continuing, some days he goes to the gym, some days he gets dressed
<i>for</i> the gym but just drives around listening to either ‘Hot To
Go!’ or podcasts about wrestling.”
</p>
<p>
“Gosh, he really likes that song.”
</p>
<p>
“He’s home every day at exactly 5:13, except for the days when he gets
home several hours before or after that, depending on—I mean, it
depends. He goes to a midday movie, goes to a bar. Target, spends a lot
of time at Target.”
</p>
<p>
“Goddammit. He’s got us beat, this guy. Don’t you see? It’s
<i>genius</i>! His erratic schedule, the unpredictability, the lack of
consistency—it <i>seems</i> like chaos because to us it IS! But to him?
A controlled chaos. A consistent inconsistency, a pattern only he
understands. It makes him impossible to plan around, impossible to stay
one step ahead of! The bastard’s got us beat. You can’t rob what you
can’t track. He’s made himself… unheistable.”
</p>
<p>
“I should point out that every time he goes out, he leaves the apartment
unlocked. So he doesn’t have to bother fumbling with his keys when he
gets back.”
</p>
<p>
“Even at night?”
</p>
<p>
“Every time.”
</p>
<p>
“Every single time! The man is a <i>machine</i>!”

<p>Last month, DeepSeek released its R1 reasoning model (now apparently
named DeepThink), with capabilities similar to OpenAI o1. What’s
important about DeepSeek isn’t its benchmark results; there are a number
of models on the same level as o1. What’s important is that it appears
to have been trained with one-tenth the resources of comparable models.
