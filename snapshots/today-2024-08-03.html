Vance head to Georgia after Harris event in same arena</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ATLANTA, GEORGIA — Former President Donald Trump returns Saturday to
Georgia, which he lost four years ago, to campaign in a state that
Democrats and Republicans see as up for grabs yet again.</p>
<p>Trump’s 5 p.m. event alongside his running mate, Ohio Senator JD
Vance, comes just days after Vice President Kamala Harris rallied
thousands in the same basketball arena at Georgia State University in
Atlanta.</p>
<p>Both parties are focusing on Georgia, a Sun Belt battleground that
Democrats had signaled just two weeks ago they would sideline in favor
of a heavier focus on the Midwestern “blue wall” states. President Joe
Biden’s decision to end his campaign and endorse Harris fueled
Democratic hopes of an expanded electoral map.</p>
<p>“The momentum in this race is shifting,” Harris told a cheering,
boisterous crowd on Tuesday. “And there are signs Donald Trump is
feeling it.”</p>
<p>Biden beat Trump in the state by 11,779 votes in 2020. Trump
pressured Georgia’s Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to
“find” enough votes to change the outcome. Trump was later indicted in
Georgia for his efforts to overturn the election, but the case remains
on hold while courts decide whether the Fulton County district attorney
can continue to prosecute it.</p>
<p>In announcing Saturday’s rally, the Trump campaign accused Harris of
costing Georgians money due to inflation and higher gas prices, which
have risen from pandemic-era lows at the end of the Trump
administration. The campaign also noted the case of Laken Riley, a
nursing student from the state who was killed while jogging in a park on
February 22. A Venezuelan citizen has been indicted on murder charges in
her death.</p>
<p>Trump and his allies have repeatedly labeled Harris the current
administration’s “border czar,” a reference to her assignment leading
White House efforts on root causes of migration.</p>
<p>But in recent days, Trump has lobbed false attacks about Harris’ race
and suggested she misled voters about her identity. Harris has stated
for years in public life that she is Black and Indian American.</p>
<p>At her rally in Atlanta, Harris called Trump and Vance “plain weird”
— a lane of messaging seized on by many other Democrats of late — and
taunted Trump for wavering on whether he’d show up for their upcoming
debate, currently on the books for September 10 on ABC.</p>
<p>Saying earlier that he would debate Harris, Trump has more recently
questioned the value of a meetup, calling host network ABC News “fake
news,” saying he “probably” will debate Harris, but he “can also make a
case for not doing it.”</p>
<p>The fact that Harris and Trump have been focusing resources on
Georgia underscores the state’s renewed significance to both parties
come November. Going to Atlanta puts Trump in the state’s largest media
market, including suburbs and exurbs that were traditional Republican
strongholds but have become more competitive as they’ve diversified and
grown in population.</p>
<p>In a strategy memo released after Biden left the race, Harris
campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon — who held the same role for Biden —
reaffirmed the importance of winning the traditional Democratic blue
wall trio of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania but also argued that
Harris’ place atop the ticket “opens up additional persuadable voters”
and described them as “disproportionately Black, Latino and under 30” in
places like Georgia.</p>
<p>Next week, along with her eventual running mate, Harris plans to
visit that Midwestern trifecta, along with North Carolina, Arizona and
Nevada. On Friday, she will make another stop in Georgia.</p>

<h2 id="call-for-startups">Call for startups</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-03, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<div class="e-content entry-content">
<p>
<img src="https://werd.io/file/66ae5659ec5999fbf003fdd2/thumb.jpg" alt="Two people working on a startup, probably." width="1024" height="576">
</p>
<p>
I don’t invest any more, but here are some areas I’d be interested to
see startups explore:
</p>
<p>
<strong>The hallway track for remote and hybrid teams.</strong> One
reason many companies are enacting return to office policies is to
re-establish cross-pollination across teams. Yes, a strong, intentional
remote culture would render that moot, but not every company
<em>has</em> that. So what does it look like to build scaffolding that
goes beyond the water cooler and intentionally surfaces ideas and
reactions across teams, including across timezones? Slack is a set of
chatrooms at heart — what if you optimize for asynchronous reflection
and building on ideas, not just real-time discussion?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Composable, local AI made easy.</strong> There are lots of use
cases for AI in the enterprise, but for many high-value use cases
sharing data with centralized services owned by OpenAI, Microsoft, or
Google isn’t tenable. Sensitive data needs to be treated carefully, and
protective contract terms often aren’t enough (consider what happens
when a provider is subpoenaed, for example). Let’s make building AI
tools that don’t share data beyond your local computer incredibly easy,
even for people who can’t code.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Pro tools for the fediverse.</strong> The fediverse is going to
continue to grow, in part because of the maturity of its underlying
technology, and in part because countries across the world are
tightening anti-monopoly rules, creating strong business reasons to
adopt open standards and interoperability. Many fediverse platforms and
services don’t meet the needs of larger organizations or professional
use cases, due to the wrong mix or features or a more technical user
experience. How can startups remove friction from taking advantage of
the fediverse, and add ecosystem tools that grow in value as more users
onboard? (By the way, I still think an API service that helps people
build tools on the fediverse has legs.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Substack (or Ghost) for indie and open source
developers.</strong> Substack and Ghost have paved the way for a kind of
journalist entrepreneur who can launch a subscription and make a living
by themselves. What if we could do the same thing for indie developers
who wanted to support their work? Imagine built-in subscriptions
connected to a social discovery mechanism where developers recommend
other developers’ work: a network that makes it far easier for
developers to make a living from doing what they love independently.
This is particularly important in a world where many developers have
left big cities and are resisting return to office mandates: going it
alone could be a viable alternative. Kickstarter et al let people
support a <em>project</em>; this would allow you to support the creator,
with more network effects and built-in software integrations than
something like a Patreon.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Metrics in a box.</strong> A tool that connects to your
analytics, payment processor, newsletter tool, etc, and automatically
gives you insights, generates actionable reports on your preferred
cadence, and answers questions without you needing to deal with schemas,
configure specific views, or make queries yourself. You could refine its
outputs by giving it feedback in natural language, and ask questions
using the same. Another way of putting this: what if your in-house data
analyst was software that you didn’t need to configure?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Redefine the US rail experience.</strong> Private rail cars (or
— more ambitiously — whole trains?) that operate a bit like a WeWork:
luxury accommodations, high-bandwidth satellite wifi, phone call booths,
desks, private rooms with comfortable beds. Make it easy to choose to
take a long-distance train instead of a flight without sacrificing
comfort or connectivity. High-speed rail is great and important, and
such a business would expand to get there, but in the meantime this
experience would make the longer travel time matter a great deal less,
while helping business travelers to lower their carbon footprint. One
can imagine this initially working best between destinations like Miami
and New York, or San Francisco and LA, but the real goal would be
nationwide. (Hey, dream big.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Magic for the elderly.</strong> A lot of people swear by
services like Magic’s executive assistant offering: a way for executives
and entrepreneurs to get remote help with doing important work. But we
all need help as we get older. What does it look like for older people
to get their own executive assistants to help them with administration
and life’s daily chores?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Open bookkeeping and administration for distributed
groups.</strong> There’s plenty of bookkeeping and administration
software out there. Most of it is understandably privacy-focused,
allowing very few people to access your sensitive information. But what
happens if you’re part of a group — an extended family managing a house,
say, or a loose co-operative — that needs to have a shared view of their
finances and administration? There’s very little for them beyond, say,
Open Collective, which is for a very specific kind of organizational
unit. What does it look like for a group to share and stream their
finances and decisions?
</p>
<p>
—
</p>
<p>
It’s been six years (gulp) since I last invested in a startup as part of
any kind of fund, but I’m still excited by the idea and the ethos of
startups. While there are plenty of bad businesses out there (for any
definition of “bad”), the idea of a group of people getting together and
trying to build a new, useful product as part of a sustainable business
engine really appeals to me. There’s definitely a part of me that wishes
I still could make financial bets into ventures. (Let’s be clear: I
could never have invested in an idea like reinventing rail travel. That
wasn’t my area. But wouldn’t it be cool?)
</p>
<p>
I really like <a href="https://homebrew.co/philosophy">Homebrew’s
investment process statement</a>, which is very close to how I’d want to
do it too (commit the time and energy to help build an ethical,
enduring, high-quality business). And this piece in particular stands
out to me:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We invest in mission-driven founders who embrace big – big ideas, big
impact, big risk.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The combination of real mission, impact, and risk is important. That’s
where the exciting stuff is.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://greylock.com/">Greylock</a>, the veteran Silicon Valley
venture capital firm, recently put out
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/call-startups-greylock-partners-93fuc/">a
call for startups</a> that was all AI, all the time. Long-time readers
will know that I have a contrarian take on that — and that I worry AI is
sucking oxygen away from other, genuinely useful products that could
form the basis of great businesses. I also don’t shy away from AI
completely: there are real applications for the technology that will
linger long after the hype cycle has died down. Still, their post was
the inspiration for this one: I think there are more interesting,
broader, longer-term trends that are worth paying attention to.
</p>
<p>
What are you excited by? If you were an investor — or if you are — what
would you be keeping your eye out for?

ends touring, citing permanent damage to singer’s voice</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Aerosmith says Steven Tyler’s voice has been
permanently damaged by a vocal cord injury last year and the band will
no longer tour.</p>
<p>The iconic band behind hits such as “Love in an Elevator” and “Livin’
on the Edge” posted a statement Friday announcing the cancellation of
remaining dates on its tour and provided an update on Tyler’s voice.</p>
<p>“He has spent months tirelessly working on getting his voice to where
it was before his injury. We’ve seen him struggling despite having the
best medical team by his side. Sadly, it is clear that a full recovery
from his vocal injury is not possible,” the statement said. “We have
made a heartbreaking and difficult, but necessary, decision — as a band
of brothers — to retire from the touring stage.”</p>
<p>Tyler announced he injured his vocal cords in September during a show
on the band’s Peace Out: The Farewell Tour. Tyler said in an Instagram
statement at the time that the injury caused bleeding but that he hoped
the band would be back after postponing a few shows.</p>
<p>Tyler’s soaring vocals have powered Aerosmith’s massive catalog of
hits since its formation in 1970, including “Dream On,” “Walk This Way”
and “Sweet Emotion.” They were near the start of a 40-date farewell tour
when Tyler was injured.</p>
<p>“We’ve always wanted to blow your mind when performing. As you know,
Steven’s voice is an instrument like no other,” the band said in
Friday’s statement to fans.</p>
<p>“It has been the honor of our lives to have our music become part of
yours,” the band said. “In every club, on every massive tour and at
moments grand and private you have given us a place in the soundtrack of
your lives.”</p>
<p>Aerosmith is a Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame inductee and a four-time
Grammy-winning band. In addition to Tyler, its members are Joe Perry,
Brad Whitford, Tom Hamilton and Joey Kramer.</p>

id="as-recruiting-rebounds-us-army-expands-basic-training-for-modern-warfare">As
recruiting rebounds, US Army expands basic training for modern
warfare</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Buoyed by an increase in recruiting, the U.S. Army will
expand its basic combat training in what its leaders hope reflects a
turning point as it prepares to meet the challenges of future wars.</p>
<p>The added training will begin in October and comes as the Army tries
to reverse years of dismal recruiting when it failed to meet its
enlistment goals. New units in the U.S. states of Oklahoma and Missouri
will train as many as 4,000 recruits every year.</p>
<p>Army leaders are optimistic they will hit their target of 55,000
recruits this year and say the influx of new soldiers forced them to
increase the number of training sites.</p>
<p>“I am happy to say last year’s recruiting transformation efforts have
us on track to make this year’s recruiting mission, with thousands
awaiting basic training” in the next year, U.S. Army Secretary Christine
Wormuth said. Adding the two new locations, she said, is a way to get
the soldiers trained and into units quickly, “with further expansion
likely next spring if our recruiting numbers keep improving.”</p>
<p>The expanded training is part of a broader effort to restructure the
Army so that it is better able to fight against a sophisticated
adversary such as Russia or China. The U.S. military spent much of the
past two decades battling insurgent groups in Iraq and Afghanistan
rather than fighting a broader war with another high-tech, more capable
nation.</p>
<p>Brigadier General Jenn Walkawicz, head of operations for the U.S.
Army’s Training and Doctrine Command, said there will be two new
training companies at Fort Sill in Oklahoma and two at Fort Leonard Wood
in Missouri.</p>
<p>Driving the growth is the successful Future Soldier Prep Course,
which was created at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, in August 2022 as a
new way to bolster enlistments. That program gives lower-performing
recruits up to 90 days of academic or fitness instruction to help them
meet military standards and move on to basic training.</p>
<p>Created two years ago, the program has been cited as a key reason
Army leaders expect that this fall they will reverse several years of
recruiting shortfalls. In the budget year that ended September 30, the
Army brought in a bit more than 50,000 recruits, falling far short of
the publicly stated “stretch goal” of 65,000.</p>
<p>The Army has 151 training companies overall that work with recruits
at Fort Jackson and Fort Moore, Georgia, in addition to the 15 training
companies assigned to the prep course. Army leaders have expanded the
prep course, which is expected to bring in nearly 20,000 recruits this
budget year, and that total is expected to spike in 2025.</p>
<p>Due to the Army’s recruiting struggles, the number of recruits going
through basic training dropped in recent years. As a result, the 15
training units, which total 27 soldiers each, including 16 drill
sergeants, were available for the prep course. But as the prep course
grows, those units are not available to do basic training.</p>
<p>“We don’t want to mess with that because right now that formula’s
working and it’s provided a lot of value for the Army,” Walkawicz said.
So, the Army is creating the four new companies and has developed plans
for more if needed.</p>
<p>She added that Fort Sill and Fort Leonard Wood have the
infrastructure, barracks and room to accommodate the new units and could
take more if needed. The costs of the program are limited because the
Army already had the equipment and rooms, but there will be maintenance,
food, staffing and other costs. Army officials did not provide a total
price.</p>
<p>The move to add units is the latest change in what has been a
tumultuous time for the Army. Coming out of the Iraq and Afghanistan
wars, when the service grew dramatically to fill the nation’s combat
needs, the U.S. military began to see recruiting dip.</p>
<p>Unemployment has been low, corporate jobs pay well and offer good
benefits, and, according to estimates, just 23% of people ages 17 to 24
are physically, mentally and morally qualified to serve without
receiving some type of waiver. Moral behavior issues include drug use,
gang ties or a criminal record.</p>
<p>Those problems were only amplified as the coronavirus pandemic took
hold, preventing recruiters from meeting with students in person at
schools, fairs and other public events.</p>
<p>In 2022, the Army fell 15,000 short of its enlistment goal of 60,000,
and the other services had to dig deep into their pools of delayed entry
candidates to meet their recruiting numbers. Then in 2023, the Army,
Navy and Air Force all missed their recruitment targets. The Marine
Corps and the tiny Space Force have consistently hit their goals.</p>
<p>Partly in response to the recruiting shortfalls, Army leaders slashed
the size of the force by about 24,000, or almost 5%. They said many of
the cuts were in already vacant jobs.</p>

id="forecasters-expect-depression-nearing-florida-to-become-tropical-storm">Forecasters
expect depression nearing Florida to become tropical storm</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MIAMI, FLORIDA — A tropical depression over Cuba is growing better
organized, forecasters said Saturday, and is likely to bring drenching
rain and coastal flooding to much of Florida’s Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>The storm strengthened into a tropical depression late Friday and is
expected to become a tropical storm by Saturday night, once it has
maximum sustained winds of 63 kilometers per hour (39 miles per hour) or
more. If the depression reaches tropical storm status, it would be named
Debby, the fourth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season.</p>
<p>Circulation was centered just south of Cienfuegos, Cuba, on Saturday
morning, but associated wind and thunderstorms were spread out over a
broad region, including southern Florida, the Florida Keys and the
Bahamas. One location in the middle of the Florida Keys island chain
reported sustained winds of 48 kph (30 mph) on Saturday morning.</p>
<p>The National Hurricane Center in Miami forecasts that the depression
will strengthen as it curves northward off the southwest Florida coast,
where the water has been extremely warm, with temperatures approaching
33 degrees Celsius (92 Fahrenheit) this week.</p>
<p>Predictions show the system could come ashore as strong tropical
storm late Sunday or early Monday and cross over northern Florida into
the Atlantic Ocean, where it’s likely to remain a tropical storm
threatening Georgia and the Carolinas early next week. Tropical storm
warnings are posted for most of Florida’s west coast and the Dry
Tortugas. A hurricane watch is posted for parts of the Big Bend area,
recognizing that there is a chance that Debby could reach hurricane
status before coming ashore.</p>
<p>Flat Florida is prone to flooding even on sunny days when so-called
king tides surge in coastal areas. This storm is predicted to push up
storm tides of 0.5 to 1.2 meters (2 to 4 feet) along most of Florida’s
Gulf Coast, including Tampa Bay, with a higher tide of 3 to 5 feet
predicted farther north in Florida’s sparsely populated Big Bend region,
where the Florida peninsula bends westward into the state’s Panhandle
region.</p>
<p>Tropical storms and hurricanes can also trigger river flooding and
overwhelm drainage systems and canals. Forecasters are warning of 125 to
250 millimeters (5 to 10 inches) of rain, which could create “locally
considerable” flash and urban flooding. Forecasters are also already
warning of moderate flooding for some rivers along Florida’s West
Coast.</p>
<p>Some of the heaviest rains could come next week in a region along the
Atlantic Coast from Jacksonville, Florida, north through Savannah,
Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina.</p>
<p>People in some Florida cities on Friday filled sandbags to protect
against possible flooding. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis declared a
state of emergency for most Florida counties, extending from the Florida
Keys up through Central Florida and the Tampa Bay region and into the
western Panhandle.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, far off Mexico’s western coast, Hurricane Carlotta
continued moving westward, deeper into the Pacific Ocean on Saturday,
with top sustained winds reaching 145 kph (90 mph). The hurricane center
said Carlotta may strengthen a little more but should begin losing
strength on Sunday as it moves into an area of unfavorable winds and
drier air. The storm is likely to dissipate into a remnant of
thunderstorms in three to four days. No watches or warnings are in
effect.</p>

thoughts about Apple’s reliance on Services revenue</h2>

Snell at Six Colors</a>]
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“In the most recent financial quarter, Apple generated $24.4 billion in
revenue from Services. The Mac, iPad, and wearables categories together
generated just $22.3 billion. Only the iPhone is more important to
Apple’s top line than Services.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is an interesting piece about how Apple’s services revenue is set
to overtake its hardware business.
</p>
<p>
Over on his blog Pixel Envy,
<a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/apple-services-revenue/">Nick Heer
worries</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“It would be disappointing if Apple sees its hardware products
increasingly as vehicles for recurring revenue.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’d go further. The beauty of Apple’s product line is that they’re
comparatively well-made products that push the boundaries of user
experience, bringing technology breakthroughs to a creative audience: as
Jobs put it, “bicycles for the mind”. Customers (including me) accept
higher prices because the products are exceptional, but that depends on
a product line that is complete.
</p>
<p>
If the product offering is a higher-priced hardware device <em>and</em>
premium monthly services on top of it, the investment starts to have
diminishing returns. It’s a loss of focus on what made Apple great, and
why people keep coming back to it. It’s greed, essentially: continuing
to push the Apple user base further and further, assuming the breaking
point is very far out.
</p>
<p>
That puts them at risk from being disrupted by someone else. Windows
ain’t it, but at some point someone is going to come in with a really
great set of hardware on an alternative stack. The question won’t be
whether it beats Apple as-is, but simply whether it’s good
<em>enough</em> at a lower price point. And then that company will grow
their offerings, until before you know it, Apple has serious
competition. It’s disruption 101, and the further Apple pushes out its
expense and friction, the more susceptible it becomes.

<p>Another month, another chunk of progress for the Servo rendering
engine. The biggest addition is enabling table rendering to be spread
across CPU cores. Parallel table layout is now enabled, spreading the
work for laying out rows and their columns over all available CPU cores.
This change is a great example of the strengths of Rayon and the
opportunistic parallelism in Servo’s layout engine. ↫ Servo blog On top
of this, there’s tons of improvements to the flexbox layout engine,
support generic font families like ‘sans-serif’ and ‘monospace’ has been
added, and Servo now supports OpenHarmony, the operating system
developed by Huawei. This month also saw a lot of work on the
development tools.</p>

<h2
id="minority-farmers-set-for-2-billion-from-usda-after-years-of-discrimination">Minority
farmers set for $2 billion from USDA after years of discrimination</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>COLUMBIA, Missouri — The Biden administration has doled out more than
$2 billion in direct payments for Black and other minority farmers
discriminated against by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the
president announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>More than 23,000 farmers were approved for payments ranging from
$10,000 to $500,000, according to the USDA. Another 20,000 who planned
to start a farm but did not receive a USDA loan received between $3,500
and $6,000.</p>
<p>Most payments went to farmers in Mississippi and Alabama.</p>
<p>USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack told reporters that the aid “is not
compensation for anyone’s loss or the pain endured, but it is an
acknowledgment by the department.”</p>
<p>The USDA has a long history of refusing to process loans from Black
farmers, approving smaller loans compared to white farmers, and in some
cases foreclosing quicker than usual when Black farmers who obtained
loans ran into problems.</p>
<p>National Black Farmers Association Founder and President John Boyd
Jr. said the aid is helpful. But, he said, it’s not enough.</p>
<p>“It’s like putting a bandage on somebody that needs open-heart
surgery,” Boyd said. “We want our land, and I want to be very, very
clear about that.”</p>
<p>Boyd is still fighting a federal lawsuit for 120% debt relief for
Black farmers that was approved by Congress in 2021. Five billion
dollars for the program was included in the $1.9 trillion COVID-19
stimulus package.</p>
<p>But the money never came. White farmers in several states filed
lawsuits arguing their exclusion was a violation of their constitutional
rights, which prompted judges to halt the program shortly after its
passage.</p>
<p>Faced with the likelihood of a lengthy court battle that would delay
payments to farmers, Congress amended the law and offered financial help
to a broader group of farmers. A new law allocated $3.1 billion to help
farmers struggling with USDA-backed loans and $2.2 billion to pay
farmers who the agency discriminated against.</p>
<p>Wardell Carter, who is Black, said no one in his farming family got
so much as access to a loan application since Carter’s father bought
34.4 hectares of Mississippi land in 1939. He said USDA loan officers
would slam the door in his face. If Black farmers persisted, Carter said
officers would have police come to their homes.</p>
<p>Without a loan, Carter’s family could not afford a tractor and
instead used a horse and mule for years. And without proper equipment,
the family could farm at most 16.2 hectares of their property — cutting
profits.</p>
<p>When they finally received a bank loan to buy a tractor, Carter said
the interest rate was 100%.</p>
<p>Boyd said he’s watched as his loan applications were torn up and
thrown in the trash, been called racial epithets, and was told to leave
in the middle of loan meetings so the officer could speak to white
farmers.</p>
<p>“We face blatant, in-your-face, real discrimination,” Boyd said. “And
I did personally. The county person who was making farm loans spat
tobacco juice on me during a loan session.”</p>
<p>At 65, Carter said he’s too old to farm his land. But he said if he
receives money through the USDA program, he will use it to get his
property in shape so his nephew can begin farming on it again. Carter
said he and his family want to pitch in to buy his nephew a tractor,
too.</p>

id="simone-biles-raises-gymnastics-bar-so-high-that-5-skills-bear-her-name">Simone
Biles raises gymnastics bar so high that 5 skills bear her name</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>paris — It is not enough — it has never been enough — for Simone
Biles to do gymnastics.</p>
<p>The 27-year-old American star has been intent almost from the start
on pushing the sport in new directions by doing things that have never
been done before. That could continue this week when she tries for her
eighth Olympic medal in Paris.</p>
<p>Five elements currently bear her name in the Code of Points after she
successfully completed them in an international competition: two on
vault, two on floor exercise and one on balance beam.</p>
<p>A quick primer.</p>
<p>Biles I (Floor exercise version)</p>
<p>She was just a teenager and recently minted national champion when
Biles performed a tumbling pass at the 2013 world championships that she
completes by doing a double layout with a half-twist at the end.</p>
<p>The move looks dangerous — Biles is essentially flying blind — but
she and former coach Aimee Boorman came up with it because it was less
taxing on her legs.</p>
<p>“It was almost kind of necessity is the mother of invention,” Boorman
told The Associated Press in 2015. “Her calf was hurting. She had bone
spurs in her ankles and she’s really good at floor with landings.”</p>
<p>Biles II (floor exercise version)</p>
<p>Biles returned to the sport in 2018 following a two-year layoff after
winning the all-around at the 2016 Olympics.</p>
<p>Not content to merely repeat herself, Biles began working on a
triple-twisting, double flip that is now known simply as ” the
triple-double.” She unveiled it while winning the 2019 U.S.
Championships then did it again at the world championships a few months
later when she won the fifth of her record six world all-around
titles.</p>
<p>“I wanted to see how it looked,” she explained afterward.</p>
<p>Biles I (vault version)</p>
<p>As with a lot of gymnastics elements, Biles took a Cheng vault and
added another layer of difficulty — this one an extra half twist on a
vault originally done by China’s Cheng Fei.</p>
<p>The vault requires Biles to do a round-off onto the vault, then a
half-twist onto the table before doing two full twists. It entered the
Code after she made it part of her routine at the 2018 world
championships.</p>
<p>“I’m embarrassed to do floor and vault after something like that,”
U.S. men’s gymnast Yul Moldauer said in 2018. “You see Simone do that
and she’s smiling the whole time. How does she do that?”</p>
<p>Biles II (vault version)</p>
<p>This may be the most dazzling, most daring one of them all.</p>
<p>The Yurchenko double pike had never been completed by a woman in
competition, and few men have even tried. She began tinkering with it in
2021, but it’s in the last year that it has morphed into perhaps the
most show-stopping thing done in the sport.</p>
<p>The vault asks Biles to do a round-off back handspring onto the
table, then two backward flips in pike position with her hands
essentially clasped to her knees. She does it with so much power, she
can sometimes overcook it. At the U.S. Olympic trials last month, it
drew a standing ovation.</p>
<p>“No, it’s not normal,” longtime coach Laurent Landi said after she
drilled it at the 2023 U.S. Championships. “She’s not normal.”</p>
<p>Biles I (balance beam version)</p>
<p>For all of her explosive tumbling, Biles is a wonder on balance beam,
too, where she can make doing intricate moves on a four-inch-wide piece
of wood seem almost casual.</p>
<p>The same year she debuted the triple-double on floor, she added a
double-twisting, double-tucked dismount off the beam. She stuck it at
the 2019 world championships, though she has since taken it out of her
repetoire.</p>
<p>What does the new uneven bars skill look like?</p>
<p>The skill Biles submitted requires her to do a forward circle around
the lower bar before turning a handstand into a 540-degree pirouette.
USA Gymnastics teased the move on X ahead of the Games. She didn’t
attempt it during the team or all-around competitions but still won gold
in both.</p>

help graduates attend college outside Hawaii a year after wildfire</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HONOLULU — College wasn’t on Keith Nove Baniqued’s mind after her
family’s home burned down in a deadly wildfire that decimated her Hawaii
town. The 17-year-old, who was 7 when she moved to Maui from the
Philippines, was about to start her senior year of high school but
shifted her focus to her family’s struggles to find a place to live amid
the tragedy.</p>
<p>Nearly a year after the fire that destroyed thousands of other homes
and killed 102 people in historic Lahaina, Baniqued is headed to the
University of Nevada, Las Vegas. And her family doesn’t have to worry
about how to pay for it, thanks to $325,000 in college scholarships
awarded Wednesday to 13 Lahainaluna High School graduates attending
schools on the U.S. mainland.</p>
<p>“Even being a senior, I really didn’t know if I was going to pursue
higher education anymore, only because I didn’t want to leave my family
in the situation that we were in,” she recalled of her feelings after
the fire.</p>
<p>Her school survived the blaze, but was closed for two months. The
reopening restored a small sense of normalcy and reignited her dream to
attend college beyond Hawaii’s shores. She also realized a college
degree would put her in a better position to help her family’s long-term
recovery.</p>
<p>She applied to colleges with nursing programs, channeled her feelings
about surviving the fire into scholarship essays and decided she would
attend UNLV — partly because its popularity among Hawaii students would
make it feel a bit like home.</p>
<p>Using a grant from the Maui Strong Fund of the Hawaii Community
Foundation, the Downtown Athletic Club of Hawaii is providing Baniqued
and her 12 classmates with about $25,000 each — meant to cover
out-of-state college costs after other scholarships and financial aid
for the first year.</p>
<p>“A lifechanging opportunity like this can be beneficial to any Hawaii
high school graduate, and even more so for Lahainaluna graduates and all
they’ve gone through,” said Keith Amemiya, president of athletic club,
which has been spearheading a fundraising campaign to support the
Lahainaluna student-athletes and coaches whose homes were destroyed by
the fire.</p>
<p>In a separate effort after the fire, the University of Hawaii
announced scholarships for 2024 Lahainaluna graduates to attend any
campus in the statewide system. Nearly 80% of a graduating class of 215
applied to UH campuses, according to school data. As of last week, 105
students had registered at a UH school, leading to a record-number of
college-bound Lahainaluna graduates, school officials said, who expect
that number to increase by mid-August.</p>
<p>Ginny Yasutake, a Lahainaluna counselor, reached out to Amemiya to
see if there was a way to do something similar to the UH scholarship for
student athletes who opted to leave Hawaii for college.</p>
<p>With help from the Hawaii Community Foundation, they found funding to
help even students who weren’t athletes. Both organizations are
committed to finding a way to provide the scholarships beyond freshman
year of out-of-state college and also to underclassmen affected by the
fire, Amemiya said.</p>
<p>“These scholarships kind of came in as a last-minute dream,” said
Principal Richard Carosso.</p>
<p>And the Hawaii scholarships provided an opportunity to many who never
thought college was even possible, he said.</p>
<p>Pursuing college highlights the resilience of a graduating class
whose freshman year of high school was disrupted by the beginning of the
COVID-19 pandemic, Carosso said.</p>
<p>Emily Hegrenes, headed to the University of California, Los Angeles,
wrote in her scholarship essay about how she had to find a way to train
as a swimmer because the Lahaina Aquatic Center was closed in a
restricted burn zone.</p>
<p>“But for my final high school season, I worked harder than ever to
recruit enough swimmers to hold team practice at a pool
forty-five-minutes away from my hometown,” she wrote. “With my Lahaina
cap on, I proudly dove straight into my fears.”</p>
<p>Talan Toshikiyo, who plans to attend Oxnard College in California,
said he aspires to become an engineer and attain financial stability
because it was already difficult for Native Hawaiians like him, and
other locals, to afford living in Hawaii before the fire.</p>
<p>“I hope Lahaina is not changed when I come back from the Mainland,”
he wrote in his essay. “I dream one day all the rent in Maui will be
lower so locals will be able to afford it and not have to move far far
away.”</p>

id="heat-deaths-of-people-without-air-conditioning-underscore-inequity">Heat
deaths of people without air conditioning underscore inequity</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PHOENIX, ARIZONA — Mexican farm worker Avelino Vazquez Navarro didn’t
have air conditioning in the motor home where he died last month in
Washington state as temperatures surged into the triple digits.</p>
<p>For the last dozen years, the 61-year-old spent much of the year
working near Pasco, Washington, sending money to his wife and daughters
in the Pacific coast state of Nayarit, Mexico, and traveling back every
Christmas.</p>
<p>Now, the family is raising money to bring his remains home.</p>
<p>“If this motor home would have had AC and it was running, then it
most likely would have helped,” said Franklin County Coroner Curtis
McGary, who determined Vazquez Navarro’s death was heat-related, with
alcohol intoxication as a contributing cause.</p>
<p>Most heat-related deaths involve homeless people living outdoors. But
those who die inside without sufficient cooling also are vulnerable.
They are typically older than 60, living alone and with a limited
income.</p>
<p>Underscoring the inequities around energy and access to air
conditioning as summers grow hotter, many victims are Black, Indigenous
or Latino, such as Vazquez Navarro.</p>
<p>“Air conditioning is not a luxury, it’s a necessity,” said Mark
Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors’
Association, which represents state energy assistance programs. “It’s a
public health issue, and it’s an affordability issue.”</p>
<p>The most vulnerable</p>
<p>People living in mobile homes or in aging trailers and RVs are
especially likely to lack proper cooling. Nearly a quarter of the indoor
heat deaths in Arizona’s Maricopa County last year were in those kinds
of dwellings, which are transformed into a broiling tin can by the
blazing desert sun.</p>
<p>“Mobile homes can really heat up because they don’t always have the
best insulation and are often made of metal,” said Dana Kennedy, AARP
director in Arizona, where many heat-related deaths occur.</p>
<p>Research shows mobile home dwellers are particularly at risk in
blistering hot Phoenix, where 45-degree Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) weather
is forecast for this weekend.</p>
<p>“People are exposed to the elements more than in other housing,” said
Patricia Solís, executive director of the Knowledge Exchange for
Resilience at Arizona State University, who worked on mapping hot
weather impacts on mobile home parks for a state preparedness plan.</p>
<p>Worse, some parks bar residents from making modifications that could
cool their homes, citing esthetic concerns. A new Arizona law required
parks for the first time this summer to let residents install cooling
methods such as window units, shade awnings and shutters.</p>
<p>In Arizona’s Maricopa County, home to Phoenix, 156 of 645
heat-related deaths last year occurred indoors in uncooled environments.
In most cases, a unit was present but was not working, was without
electricity or turned off, public health officials said.</p>
<p>One victim was Shirley Marie Kouplen, who died after being overcome
by high temperatures inside her Phoenix mobile home amid a heat wave
when the extension cord providing her electricity was unplugged.</p>
<p>Emergency responders recorded the 70-year-old widow’s body
temperature at 41.7 C (107.1 F). Kouplen, who was diabetic and had high
blood pressure, was rushed to a hospital, where she died.</p>
<p>Kouplen apparently was struggling financially, if the shabby
condition of her mobile home was any indication. It still sits on Lot
60, surrounded by a chain-link fence with a locked gate and a dirt
driveway overgrown with weeds.</p>
<p>It’s unclear how the cord got unplugged, if Kouplen had an
electricity account or how she got her power.</p>
<p>“Losing your air conditioning is now a life-threatening event,” said
Texas A&amp;M University climate scientist Andrew Dessler, who grew up
in hot, humid Houston in the 1970s. “You didn’t want to lose your air
conditioning, but it wasn’t going to kill you. And now it is.”</p>
<p>Arizona’s regulated utilities have been banned since 2022 from
cutting off power during the summer, following the 2018 death of a
72-year-old woman after Arizona Public Service disconnected her
electricity over a $51 debt.</p>
<p>Ann Porter, spokesperson for Arizona Public Service, which provides
electricity to homes in the park where Kouplen lived, said “due to
privacy concerns” the company could not say if she had an account at the
time of her death or in the past. Porter said the utility does not cut
power from June 1 to Oct. 15.</p>
<p>Cutoffs can occur after those dates if mounting debts are not
paid.</p>
<p>Arizona is among 19 states with shut-off protections, leaving about
half of the U.S. population without safeguards against losing
electricity during the summer, the National Energy Assistance Directors
Association said in a new study.</p>
<p>Almost 20% of very-low-income families have no air conditioning at
all, especially in places such as Washington state, where they weren’t
commonly installed before climate-fueled heat waves grew increasingly
stronger, more frequent and longer lasting.</p>
<p>Not only in the Southwest</p>
<p>In the Pacific Northwest, several hundred people died during a 2021
heat wave, prompting Portland, Oregon, to launch a program to provide
portable cooling units to vulnerable, low-income people.</p>
<p>Chicago, better known for its cold winters, saw a heat wave kill 739
mostly older people over five days in 1995. Amid high humidity and
temperatures over 37.7 C (100 F), most victims had no air conditioning
or couldn’t afford to turn on their units.</p>
<p>In 2022, Chicago adopted a cooling ordinance after three women died
in their apartments in a building for older adults on an unusually warm
spring day. Certain residential buildings must now have at least one
air-conditioned common area for cooling when the heat index exceeds 26.6
C (80 F) and cooling is unavailable in individual units.</p>
<p>Nonprofits in historically hotter areas such as Arizona also are
trying to better address the inequities low-income people face during
the sweltering summers. The Phoenix-based community agency Wildfire
recently raised money to buy over $2 million worth of air conditioning
equipment to help 150 households statewide over three years, Executive
Director Kelly McGowan said.</p>
<p>Laws protect renters in some places. Phoenix landlords must ensure
that air conditioning units cool to 28 C (82 F) or below and that
evaporative coolers lower the temperature to 30C (86 F).</p>
<p>Palm Springs, California, and Las Vegas, Nevada, both desert cities,
have ordinances requiring landlords to offer air conditioning in rental
dwellings. Dallas, where temperatures can pass 43.3 C (110 F) in the
summer, has a similar law.</p>
<p>But most renters pay their own electricity costs, leaving them to
agonize whether they can afford to even turn on the cooling or how high
to set the thermostat.</p>
<p>A new report estimates the average cost for U.S. families to keep
cool from June to September will grow nationwide by 7.9% this year, from
$661 in 2023 to $719 this summer.</p>
<p>Wolf noted the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program,
which grants money to states to help families pay for heating and
cooling, is underfunded, with 80% going to heat homes in winter.</p>

<h2 id="the-blowing-smoke-up-your-ass-theory-of-ai">The “blowing smoke
up your ass” theory of AI</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-03, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Let me preface this by saying that I don’t believe the current AI tools are entirely useless. There probably are some good use cases out there and it’s an overall interesting tech. Having said that, I have some thoughts I want to share with you.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
I love technology. I’m not obsessed with it but I do enjoy staying up to
date with what’s happening in the tech world. This is both on the
hardware and on the software side of things. Sadly, the current state of
tech news is quite boring because it’s dominated by AI. AI this, AI
that. New AI companies cropping up, old companies pivoting to AI, and
companies that have no business being in the AI race announcing their AI
strategies. It’s everywhere. And yet, there are PLENTY of examples of
how bad this tech can be.
</p>
<p>
And yet, “people” keep being super optimistic. And when I say people, I
mean mostly developers. Because that’s my current theory: the vast
majority of the AI hype is driven by tech people who are struggling to
realise that AI is most useful in their line of work. Every time people
discuss AI the best example they can come up with for how useful these
tools are is coding. AI tools are—allegedly—great if you need help
coding something and you don’t know how to do it. Which is great, if
you’re a developer.
</p>
<p>
The current state of AI is filled with mostly nonsense. Just look at
what the big players are announcing. Google has tried to shove its
stupid AI thing inside search results and has failed spectacularly and
they’re now slowly retreating. Apple had an entire event dedicated to AI
to announce a smarter Siri and some smart—allegedly—writing aid. Cool, I
guess? OpenAi is announcing all sorts of tools that are cool tech demos
but I can’t see why the population at large should be excited about any
of that stuff.
</p>
<p>
I’m starting to believe that tech companies—and their VC companions—are
drinking way too much of their own Kool-Aid because they fail to realise
that the vast majority of the usefulness of AI tools can be found in the
industries that work on said tools. At least that’s my current theory.
But hey, I said it many times before, I’m a complete idiot and I’m happy
to be proven wrong. If you have a different theory I want to hear it so
get in touch or maybe ask your AI bot to get in touch with me.

id="maui-fire-lawsuit-parties-reach-4b-global-settlement-court-filings-say">Maui
fire lawsuit parties reach $4B global settlement, court filings say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HONOLULU — The parties in lawsuits seeking damages for last year’s
Maui wildfires have reached a $4 billion global settlement, a court
filing said Friday, nearly one year after the deadliest U.S. wildfire in
more than a century.</p>
<p>The term sheet with details of the settlement is not publicly
available, but the liaison attorneys filed a motion Friday saying the
global settlement seeks to resolve all Maui fire claims for $4.037
billion. The motion asks the judge to order that insurers can’t
separately go after the defendants to recoup money paid to
policyholders.</p>
<p>“We’re under no illusions that this is going to make Maui whole,”
Jake Lowenthal, a Maui attorney selected as one of four liaisons for the
coordination of the cases, told The Associated Press. “We know for a
fact that it’s not going to make up for what they lost.”</p>
<p>Thomas Leonard, who lost his Front Street condo in the fire and spent
hours in the ocean behind a seawall hiding from the flames, welcomed the
news.</p>
<p>“It gives us something to work with,” he said. “I’m going to need
that money to rebuild.”</p>
<p>Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said in a statement that seven defendants will
pay the $4.037 billion to compensate those who have already brought
claims for the August 8, 2023, fires that killed 102 people and
destroyed the historic downtown area of Lahaina on Maui.</p>
<p>Green said the proposed settlement is an agreement in principle and
would “help our people heal.”</p>
<p>“My priority as governor was to expedite the agreement and to avoid
protracted and painful lawsuits so as many resources as possible would
go to those affected by the wildfires as quickly as possible,” he said
in a statement.</p>
<p>He said it was unprecedented to settle lawsuits like this in only one
year.</p>
<p>“It will be good that our people don’t have to wait to rebuild their
lives as long as others have in many places that have suffered similar
tragedies,” Green said.</p>
<p>Hawaiian Electric CEO Sheelee Kimura said the settlement will allow
the parties to move forward without the added challenges and
divisiveness of litigation.</p>
<p>“For the many affected parties to work with such commitment and focus
to reach resolution in a uniquely complex case is a powerful
demonstration of how Hawaiʻi comes together in times of crisis,” Kimura
said in a statement.</p>
<p>Hawaiian Electric said the settlement will help reestablish the
company’s financial stability. It said payments would begin after final
approval and were expected no earlier than the middle of next year.</p>
<p>Gilbert Keith-Agaran, a Maui attorney who represents victims,
including families who lost relatives, said the amount was “woefully
short.” But he said it was a deal plaintiffs needed to consider given
Hawaiian Electric’s limited assets and potential bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Lowenthal noted there were “extenuating circumstances” that made
lawyers worry the litigation would drag on for years.</p>
<p>Now that a settlement has been reached, more work needs to be done on
next steps, like how to divvy up the amount.</p>
<p>“This is the first step to allowing the Maui fire victims to get
compensation sooner than later,” Lowenthal said.</p>
<p>More than 600 lawsuits have been filed over the deaths and
destruction caused by the fires, which burned thousands of homes and
displaced 12,000 people. In the spring, a judge appointed mediators and
ordered all parties to participate in settlement talks.</p>
<p>Four other defendants did not immediately respond to email messages
or phone calls seeking comment. They are Maui County, Hawaiian Telcom,
Kamehameha Schools — formerly known as Bishop Estate — and West Maui
Land Co.</p>
<p>Spectrum/Charter Communications declined to comment.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic made it impossible to administer the SAT exam

id="pentagon-chief-revokes-plea-deals-with-3-sept.-11-suspects">Pentagon
chief revokes plea deals with 3 Sept. 11 suspects</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Friday scrapped a
plea agreement with September 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, just
two days after the announcement of a deal that reportedly would have
taken the death penalty off the table.</p>
<p>Deals with Mohammed and two alleged accomplices announced Wednesday
had appeared to have moved their long-running cases toward resolution –
but sparked anger among some relatives of those killed on September 11,
2001, as well as criticism from leading Republican politicians.</p>
<p>“I have determined that, in light of the significance of the decision
to enter into pre-trial agreements with the accused … responsibility for
such a decision should rest with me,” Austin said in a memorandum
addressed to Susan Escallier, who oversaw the case.</p>
<p>“I hereby withdraw from the three pre-trial agreements that you
signed on July 31, 2024 in the above-referenced case,” the memo
said.</p>
<p>The cases against the 9/11 defendants have been bogged down in
pre-trial maneuverings for years, while the accused remained held at the
Guantanamo Bay military base in Cuba.</p>
<p>The New York Times reported this week that Mohammed, Walid bin Attash
and Mustafa al-Hawsawi had agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy in
exchange for a life sentence, instead of facing a trial that could lead
to their executions.</p>
<p>Much of the legal jousting surrounding the men’s cases has focused on
whether they could be tried fairly after having undergone methodical
torture at the hands of the CIA in the years after 9/11.</p>
<p>The plea agreements would have avoided that thorny issue, but they
also sparked sharp criticism from political opponents of President Joe
Biden’s administration.</p>
<p>‘Sweetheart deal’</p>
<p>Republican lawmaker Mike Rogers, the chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee, sent a letter to Austin that said the deals were
“unconscionable,” while House Speaker Mike Johnson said they were a
“slap in the face” to the families of the nearly 3,000 people killed in
the September 11 attacks.</p>
<p>And Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s running mate, JD
Vance, described the agreements as a “sweetheart deal with 9/11
terrorists,” saying during a campaign rally: “We need a president who
kills terrorists, not negotiates with them.”</p>
<p>Mohammed was regarded as one of Al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden’s most
trusted and intelligent lieutenants before his March 2003 capture in
Pakistan. He then spent three years in secret CIA prisons before
arriving at Guantanamo in 2006.</p>
<p>The trained engineer – who has said he masterminded the 9/11 attacks
“from A to Z” – was involved in a string of major plots against the
United States, where he had attended university.</p>
<p>Bin Attash, a Saudi of Yemeni origin, allegedly trained two of the
hijackers who carried out the September 11 attacks, and his U.S.
interrogators also said he confessed to buying the explosives and
recruiting members of the team that killed 17 sailors in an attack on
the USS Cole.</p>
<p>After the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, he took refuge in
neighboring Pakistan and was captured there in 2003. He was then held in
a network of secret CIA prisons.</p>
<p>Hawsawi is suspected of managing the financing for the 9/11 attacks.
He was arrested in Pakistan on March 1, 2003, and was also held in
secret prisons before being transferred to Guantanamo in 2006.</p>
<p>The United States used Guantanamo, an isolated naval base, to hold
militants captured during the “War on Terror” that followed the
September 11 attacks in a bid to keep the defendants from claiming
rights under U.S. law.</p>
<p>The facility held roughly 800 prisoners at its peak, but they have
since slowly been repatriated to other countries. Biden pledged before
his election to try to shut down Guantanamo, but it remains open.</p>

military sending reinforcement to the Middle East</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. warships and fighter jets are headed to the Middle
East and nearby areas to bolster American defenses in support of Israel,
as both countries brace for a possible military strike by Iran.</p>
<p>U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin late Friday signed orders to move
the additional assets and capabilities to the Middle East and parts of
Europe, following pledges by Tehran and its proxies to take revenge for
the killings this past week of a top Hezbollah commander in Lebanon and
the Hamas terror group’s political leader on Iranian soil.</p>
<p>The U.S. moves include sending the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft
carrier strike group to the Middle East, along with naval cruisers and
destroyers capable of shooting down ballistic missiles.</p>
<p>In addition, the U.S. is sending an additional fighter squadron to
the region and is taking steps to allow for the deployment of land-based
missile defense capabilities.</p>
<p>The Pentagon did not say when the various ships and planes will be in
place, but in a statement Friday it described the moves as necessary to
“mitigate the possibility of regional escalation by Iran or Iran’s
partners and proxies.”</p>
<p>The statement also said the movement of more military capabilities to
the region aims “to improve U.S. force protection, to increase support
for the defense of Israel, and to ensure the United States is prepared
to respond to various contingencies.”</p>
<p>The new orders came just hours after Austin pledged additional
support to Israel during a call with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav
Gallant.</p>
<p>“The secretary reiterated ironclad support for Israel’s security and
informed the minister of additional measures to include ongoing and
future defensive force posture changes that the department will take to
support the defense of Israel,” Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said
during a briefing.</p>
<p>The Pentagon’s support for Israel since the October 7 Hamas terror
attack “should leave Iran, Lebanese Hezbollah and other Iranian-backed
terrorist groups with no doubt about U.S. resolve,” she said.</p>
<p>Tensions in the region have escalated significantly in the past week,
following an Israeli strike in Lebanon that killed Fouad Shukur,
Hezbollah’s top military commander, and the subsequent assassination of
Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was in Tehran to celebrate
the inauguration of Iran’s new president.</p>
<p>Israel has not publicly claimed responsibility for Haniyeh’s death,
but Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, put the onus on
Israel and called for retribution.</p>
<p>“The criminal, terrorist Zionist regime martyred our dear guest in
our territory and has caused our grief, but it has also prepared the
ground for a severe punishment,” Khamenei posted on the X social media
platform.</p>
<p>“It is our duty to take revenge,” he added in a separate post.</p>
<p>Iranian officials said Thursday they planned to meet with
representatives from Iran’s key proxies — including Hamas, Hezbollah,
Yemen’s Houthis and militias in Iraq and Syria — to plan their next
steps.</p>
<p>“How Iran and the resistance front will respond is currently being
reviewed,” said Major General Mohammad Bagheri, Iran’s armed forces
chief, speaking on Iranian state TV.</p>
<p>“This will certainly happen, and the Zionist regime [Israel] will
undoubtedly regret it,” he added.</p>
<p>But U.S. officials, seeking to prevent the tensions from exploding
into a regional war, have repeatedly signaled that Washington would not
leave Israel undefended.</p>
<p>During a call Thursday between U.S. President Joe Biden and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Biden “discussed efforts to support
Israel’s defense against threats, including against ballistic missiles
and drones, to include new defensive U.S. military deployments,”
according to the U.S. readout.</p>
<p>U.S. defense officials Friday likewise emphasized Israel would not
stand alone in the face of Iranian aggression.</p>
<p>“We will stand with Israel in their self-defense,” said Singh.</p>
<p>“These are defensive capabilities,” Singh added. “All of our
capabilities that we have there in the region are defensive and to send
a message of deterrence.”</p>
<p>Besides the additional ships and warplanes headed to the Middle East,
the Pentagon has a U.S. Marine Corps amphibious ready group with some
4,000 troops in the region.</p>
<p>The USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier strike group is also in the Middle
East but is expected to leave once the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft
carrier strike group arrives.</p>
<p>This would not be the first time the U.S. has enhanced its defensive
capabilities to help shield Israel from an Iranian attack.</p>
<p>This past April, the U.S. moved naval destroyers and other military
assets into the region while coordinating with Britain, Jordan, Saudi
Arabia and other allies in the Middle East to thwart a massive drone and
missile barrage by Iran.</p>
<p>At the time, one U.S. official called the effort an “incredible
military achievement.”</p>
<p>Whether the U.S. will be able to rely on a similar coalition to deter
a second Iranian attack on Israel, however, is unclear.</p>
<p>Whether Iran and its proxies would attempt another aerial attack on
Israel, after an estimated 99% of the missiles and drones that they
launched in April failed to hit a target, is also unclear.</p>
<p>“Iran is currently in the process of making a difficult decision on
how to respond to the targeting killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh
in Tehran,” said Robert Murrett, a retired U.S. vice admiral and deputy
director of the Institute for Security Policy and Law at Syracuse
University.</p>
<p>“Iran will likely carefully calibrate its response to the Israelis,”
Murrett told VOA via email. “They [the Iranians] are fully aware of the
regional implications of any direct or indirect attack on Israel with or
without surrogates.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Pentagon insisted Friday that a further
escalation between Iran and Israel “is not inevitable.”</p>
<p>“We do believe there is an off-ramp here, and that is that [Gaza]
cease-fire deal,” between Israel and Hamas, Singh said.</p>

pledges Israel will not stand alone if Iran attacks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The United States is preparing to move troops and
military capabilities to help defend Israel from a retaliatory strike by
Iran.</p>
<p>U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin pledged the support during a call
Friday with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, though U.S. defense
officials said a decision on which units and capabilities would be
shifted had not yet been made.</p>
<p>“The secretary reiterated ironclad support for Israel’s security and

<h2 id="us-lawmaker-calls-chinese-sanctions-badge-of-honor">US lawmaker
calls Chinese sanctions ‘badge of honor’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Representative Jim McGovern, the most recent U.S.
lawmaker to be put under Chinese sanctions, says he will wear the
sanctions “as a badge of honor,” calling on the Chinese government to
end its oppressive actions in Tibet, Xinjiang and Hong Kong in a
statement emailed to VOA from the representative’s media office
Friday.</p>
<p>“These absurd sanctions against me only serve to highlight how PRC
leaders are afraid of free and open debate. They seek to punish and
silence those who disagree with them. But the world is watching what
they do, and people who care about human rights will not be silent,” he
said in the statement.</p>
<p>China placed McGovern under sanctions Wednesday for frequently
“interfering in China’s internal affairs.” In his politics, McGovern has
taken on the Tibetan cause, sponsoring a bill advocating for a peaceful
resolution of the China-Tibet dispute that President Joe Biden signed
into law on July 12.</p>
<p>China views Tibet as an “inseparable part of China since ancient
times,” despite supporters of the Tibetan Government in Exile and the
Dalai Lama saying that Tibet has historically been independent. Chinese
state-sponsored media Xinhua said McGovern’s Tibet-China Dispute Act
“grossly interferes in China’s internal affairs,” violates international
law and distorts historical facts to suppress China and encourage
Tibetan separatist movements.</p>
<p>Framed as a response to McGovern’s efforts to undermine Chinese
territorial sovereignty, the sanctions freeze the representative’s
Chinese assets, prohibit organizations or individuals in China from
engaging with him, and ban him and his family from entering Chinese
territory, according to a publication from Xinhua.</p>
<p>McGovern, who represents the state of Massachusetts in the House of
Representatives, has no assets or business dealings in China.</p>
<p>McGovern’s Tibet-China Dispute Act, gives the State Department
increased authority to counter Chinese disinformation about Tibet and
promotes the resumption of talks between Chinese leaders and the Dalai
Lama. No such talks have occurred since 2010.</p>
<p>China stands accused of large-scale human rights abuses in Tibet,
which the congressman hoped to alleviate with this legislation.</p>
<p>In a statement released on June 12 when the bill passed the House,
McGovern said, “The People’s Republic of China has systematically denied
Tibetans the right to self-determination and continues to deliberately
erase Tibetan religion, culture and language.</p>
<p>“The ongoing oppression of the Tibetan people is a grave tragedy, and
our bill provides further tools that empower both America and the
international community to stand up for justice and peace,” he said.</p>
<p>Among the signees of the statement were House Foreign Affairs
Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, Senator Todd Young, McGovern and
Senator Jeff Merkley.</p>
<p>China has sanctioned other U.S. representatives for their involvement
in an issue that threatens Chinese territorial homogeneity. Over the
last year, China has sanctioned Representative McCaul and former
Representative Mike Gallagher over their support for Taiwan.</p>

<h2 id="will-suburbanites-buy-an-ev-if-its-a-chevy-equinox">Will
Suburbanites Buy an EV If It’s a Chevy Equinox?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-02, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzA5MzAwNS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NTQyNzg5N30.PMzfaikz10MLWnMH9ChMuySp2aZz7RGCHXEuIDQoe5Y/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Take a quick look at
<a href="https://www.kbb.com/best-cars/top-10-25-best-selling-cars-trucks-suvs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
cars Americans buy</u></a> and you’ll see the usual suspects that
populate our parking lots: Full-size pickup trucks take their place at
the top of the podium, while a few well-known sedans — and lots of SUVs
and crossovers — round out the top 25. What you <em><em>won’t</em></em>
see is much overlap with the big electric vehicle push.
</p>
<p>
The Tesla Model Y is there, an outlier in a field of mostly
gas-guzzlers. The F-150 and Silverado trucks occupy spots one and two,
and while Ford and Chevy have introduced fully electric versions of
each, they haven’t been able to convince many pickup partisans to go EV.
As for the thoroughbreds of the Target run that Americans buy in droves,
a few come as plug-in hybrids, but there are no fully electric Nissan
Rogues, Subaru Foresters, or Honda CR-Vs on offer.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly, though, here comes a familiar face. This summer, Chevrolet
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/22/gm-chevy-equinox-ev.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rolled
out</u></a> the Equinox EV, a battery-powered version of the small
crossover that sells by the hundreds of thousands in its combustion
configuration. And later this year it has promised to release a true
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/728457/2025-chevrolet-equinox-ev-pricing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>entry-level
version</u></a> of this vehicle that starts around the magical $35,000
mark. The electrified Equinox is, on the one hand, painfully ordinary,
just a battery-powered version of the car you see in the school drop-off
line. Yet it might be the most important EV of the moment, and one that
could tell us a lot about the success of
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/07/02/gm-tops-q2-first-half-ev-sales-records-new-chevy-evs-arrive/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>GM’s
electric fortunes</u></a> and the true state of the American EV buyer.
</p>
<p>
Whether we’re truly in an EV funk depends on how you look at it. Sales
aren’t growing as fast in 2024 as they did in 2023, but that’s largely
because the industry leader, Tesla, got
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-shareholder-vote" target="_self"><u>distracted</u></a>
from building new cars people actually want. EV sales didn’t spike into
the stratosphere once more models hit the market, as some predicted, but
that’s because such predictions were always specious. Whatever spin or
narrative one puts on top of the car sales data, the question is
basically this: Now that the early adopters have adopted, what will it
take for the silent majority to buy electric cars?
</p>
<p>
Lots of those potential EV buyers are brand loyalists. They own a
Subaru, and once they drive it into the ground, they’ll get another one.
They are on their third Toyota RAV4. They are Chevy ’til they die. For
some of them, the arrival of an EV in their favorite make or model might
be the tipping point to try out the life electric. General Motors
doesn’t have to sell all of its fans on the idea right away, either.
Chevrolet sells more than 200,000 petrol-powered Equinoxes in a typical
year. Moving just <em><em>some</em></em> of those people to electric
power would be a difference-maker in American EV momentum.
</p>
<p>
There’s something about a well-known name, too. Ford tried to dust
little sex appeal onto the Mustang Mach-E by putting the pony car’s name
onto its electric crossover. But making an electric version of a Panera
icon like the Equinox says something else. It’s an attempt to signal to
the practicality-minded parents of America that it’s their turn to try
an EV.
</p>
<p>
Detroit had hoped such logic would work when it electrified its
money-makers, the full-size trucks. But the automakers ran into
headwinds, in part because lots of pickup drivers belong to the “never
EV” camp and thought this amounted to electrification being forced on
them. People behind the wheel of a family crossover like the Equinox are
less likely to see their vehicle as an extension of tribal identity.
It’s a car, and if they can be convinced that an electric one can save
them money or make life easier, a lot of them will probably take the
plunge.
</p>
<p>
Then there’s the other reason to see the Equinox as an acid test: price.
Well-equipped versions of the EV now arriving at Chevy dealerships cost
well into the $40,000s. But the simpler 1LT version of the car that’s
tipped to debut in the fall will start as low as $35,000. It’ll be
eligible for the full $7,500 tax credit, taking the effective cost of
the car down under $30,000 — effectively the same as the $28,6000
starting MSRP of the
<a href="https://www.chevrolet.com/suvs/equinox" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>gas-burning
Equinox</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
This is territory where only smaller EVs like the Chevy Bolt and Nissan
Leaf had been able to play. The Equinox, though, is no city compact, but
rather a family crossover with a promised 319 miles of driving range. If
it comes to fruition, it’s a hell of a value proposition compared to
where the EV market has been, with most vehicles starting with 200-some
miles of range and costing $40,000 or more, a point where not even
$7,500 in Biden bucks made them cost-competitive with the perfectly
ordinary cars that make up the bulk of American auto sales.
</p>
<p>
In other words, we’re about to find out whether money really was the
issue holding back the EV revolution. If the EV Equinox
<em><em>doesn’t</em></em> take off, then we can expect to hear more
bugles of retreat in the form of headlines about automakers scaling back
electrification and pushing more hybrids out of fear that the suburbs
truly aren’t ready for the electric car. There’s a lot at stake for the
EV push — and for Detroit, where GM has
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/autos/gm-mary-barra-all-electric-ev-commitment-rcna155389" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recommitted</u></a>
to reaching an all-electric future, eventually.

<h2 id="override-xdg-open-behavior-with-xdg-override">Override xdg-open
behavior with xdg-override</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>Most application on GNU/Linux by convention delegate to xdg-open when
they need to open a file or a URL. This ensures consistent behavior
between applications and desktop environments: URLs are always opened in
our preferred browser, images are always opened in the same preferred
viewer. However, there are situations when this consistent behavior is
not desired: for example, if we need to override default browser just
for one application and only temporarily. This is where xdg-override
helps: it replaces xdg-open with itself to alter the behavior without
changing system settings. ↫ xdg-override GitHub page I love this project
ever since I came across it a few days ago. Not because I need it – I
really don’t – but because of the story behind its creation. The author
of the tool, Dmytro Kostiuchenko, wanted Slack, which he only uses for
work, to only open his work browser – which is a different browser from
his default browser. For example, imagine you normally use Firefox for
everything, but for all your work-related things, you use Chrome. So,
when you open a link sent to you in Slack by a colleague, you want that
specific link to open in Chrome. Well, this is not easily achieved in
Linux. Applications on Linux tend to use freedesktop.org’s xdg-open for
this, which looks at the file mimeapps.list to learn which application
opens which file type or URL. To solve Kostiuchenko’s issue, changing
the variable $XDG_CONFIG_HOME just for Slack to point xdg-open to a
different configuration file doesn’t work, because the setting will be
inherited by everything else spwaned from Slack itself. Changing
mimeapps.list doesn’t work either, of course, since that would affect
all other applications, too. So, what’s the actual solution? We’d like
also not to change xdg-open implementation globally in our system:
ideally, the change should only affect Slack, not all other apps. But
foremost, diverging from upstream is very unpractical. However, in the
spirit of this solution, we can introduce a proxy implementation of
xdg-open, which we’ll “inject” into Slack by adding it to PATH. ↫ Dmytro
Kostiuchenko xdg-override takes this idea and runs with it: It is based
on the idea described above, but the script won’t generate proxy
implementation. Instead, xdg-override will copy itself to
/tmp/xdg-override-$USER/xdg-open and will set a few $XDG_OVERRIDE_*
variables and the $PATH. When xdg-override is invoked from this new
location as xdg-open, it’ll operate in a different mode, parsing
$XDG_OVERRIDE_MATCH and dispatching the call appropriately. I tested
this script briefly, but automated tests are missing, so expect some
rough edges and bugs. ↫ Dmytro Kostiuchenko I don’t fully understand how
it works, but I get the overall gist of what it’s doing. I think it’s
quite clever, and solves a very specific issue in a non-destructive way.
While it’s not something most people will ever need, it feels like
something that if you do need it, it will quickly become a default part
of your toolbox or workflow.</p>

id="harris-secures-enough-democratic-delegate-votes-to-be-nominee-chair-says">Harris
secures enough Democratic delegate votes to be nominee, chair says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris has secured enough
votes from delegates to become her party’s nominee for president,
Democratic National Committee chair Jaime Harrison said Friday.</p>
<p>The announcement was made before the online voting process ends on
Monday, reflecting the breakneck speed of a campaign that is eager to
maintain momentum after President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid and
endorsed Harris as his successor less than two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Harris is poised to be the first woman of color at the top of a major
party’s ticket, and she joined a call with supporters to say she is
“honored to be the presumptive Democratic nominee.”</p>
<p>“It’s not going to be easy. But we’re going to get this done,” she
said. “As your future president, I know we are up to this fight.”</p>
<p>Harrison pledged that Democrats “will rally around Vice President
Kamala Harris and demonstrate the strength of our party” during their
convention in Chicago later this month.</p>
<p>The Democratic National Committee did not provide details of the
delegate vote count, including a number or state-by-state breakdowns,
during a virtual event that had the flavor of a telethon, with campaign
officials keeping tabs on a delegate-counting process whose result is a
foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>No other candidate challenged Harris for the nomination, and she
swiftly solidified Democratic support in the days after Biden endorsed
her.</p>
<p>Democrats still plan a state-by-state roll call during the party’s
convention, the traditional way that a nominee is chosen. However, that
will be purely ceremonial because of the online voting.</p>
<p>New campaign personnel</p>
<p>As Harris prepares to face off with Republican nominee Donald Trump,
her campaign is reorganizing its senior staff and bringing on a coterie
of veterans of President Barack Obama’s successful campaigns.</p>
<p>David Plouffe will serve as a senior adviser focused on Harris’
pathway to the 270 Electoral College votes she needs to win the
election. To take the role, he will stop consulting for TikTok, the
social media app, as well as a podcast that he was hosting with
Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump campaign manager, according to a
person familiar with his plans.</p>
<p>In addition, Stephanie Cutter will advise on messaging and strategy,
while Mitch Stewart will serve as senior adviser for battleground
states. Brian Nelson, who until recently was an undersecretary for
terrorism and financial intelligence at the Treasury Department, has
shifted to the campaign to advise Harris on policy.</p>
<p>Despite the additions, many aspects of the campaign remain the same
from when Biden was the candidate. Jen O’Malley Dillon still serves as
chairwoman and will oversee the entire staff structure.</p>
<p>Other unchanged senior roles include Julie Chavez Rodriguez as
campaign manager, Quentin Fulks as principal deputy campaign manager and
Michael Tyler as communications director.</p>
<p>Sheila Nix will continue as Harris’ senior adviser and chief of staff
on the campaign. Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia
Fudge, who was recently brought on as a campaign co-chair, is expanding
her portfolio to include outreach and strategy.</p>
<p>Brian Fallon, who had been Harris’ campaign communications director
when Biden was still on the ticket, will now serve as senior adviser of
communications.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Allen, most recently an undersecretary at the State
Department, will be chief of staff for Harris’ running mate, who has not
yet been chosen. Harris is expected to interview candidates over the
weekend.</p>
<p>Democratic officials have said the accelerated roll call process was
necessary because of an Aug. 7 deadline to ensure candidates appear on
the Ohio ballot.</p>
<p>Ohio state lawmakers have since changed the deadline, but the
modification doesn’t take effect until Sept. 1. Democratic attorneys
said that waiting until after the initial deadline to determine a
presidential nominee could prompt a legal challenge.</p>

repository that will bring native 1200p resolution support to the
popular handheld console. That’s good news for anyone who purchased a
DeckHD display. They’ll be fully supported by SteamOS once Valve pushes
the update — no more third-party patches required. DeckHD was introduced

<p class="drop-caps">
When a wildfire starts, there is rarely a witness.
</p>
<p>
Deep in the mountains, lightning strikes a tree on
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/hottest-day-ever-climate-change-weather-heat-extreme-global-warming-8e2b0b7fa0360ecb931ca333a832c694" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
hottest day in millennia</u></a>. A dragging trailer chain, unnoticed by
a driver, sends sparks into the bone-dry roadside brush. Hikers splash
water over an illegal campfire, but it continues to smolder after they
leave. And on the right day, in the right weather, unattended and
unreported, these fires start to grow.
</p>
<p>
There is another kind of fire, too — one where the presence of a
witness, some would argue, is the entire point. Arson officially
accounts for only about 10% of fires handled by Cal Fire, the agency
that manages wildfires and structure fires on California’s 31 million
acres of wildlands and forests. But when there are thousands of fires
across the state during a given season, that’s not an inconsequential
number. “Getting 300 to 400 confirmed arson fires a year — that’s a lot
of fires that don’t need to occur,” Gianni Muschetto, the staff chief of
Cal Fire’s law enforcement division, told me.
</p>
<p>
The
<a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2024/7/24/park-fire" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Park
Fire</u></a>, which has burned nearly 400,000 acres
<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/park-fire-rages-anxieties-run-high-communities-memories/story?id=112446026" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>near
Paradise</u></a>, north of Sacramento, is now the fourth biggest
wildfire in California’s recorded history. As of Friday afternoon, it is
still only 24% contained. Investigators have charged 42-year-old Ronnie
Dean Stout II with felony arson in connection with starting the blaze,
alleging he pushed his burning car into a gully, where it ignited the
surrounding vegetation. (Reports conflict over whether Stout
<a href="https://x.com/grrrrrrrrrrl/status/1816341772546761110" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>set
his car on fire intentionally</u></a> or the engine accidentally caught
fire
<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/07/30/california-wildfire-park-fire-arson-charges-updates/74598770007/#:~:text=started%20when%20Stout-,revved,-his%20car%27s%20engine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>while
he was revving it</u></a>.) Stout was then “seen calmly leaving the area
by blending in with the other citizens who were in the area,” Butte
County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said in a statement. Stout
<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/07/30/california-wildfire-park-fire-arson-charges-updates/74598770007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>denies</u></a>
the charges.
</p>
<p>
In California, which has
<a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/california-climate/2024/07/08/when-mowing-your-lawn-is-a-felony-00166932" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>extremely
strict arson laws</u></a>, the felony is divided in the penal code into
two different categories: “reckless” and “intentional” arson. Muschetto
explained that someone shooting off illegal fireworks on a dry day might
be charged with reckless arson: “They weren’t necessarily trying to
start a wildland fire, but because of their reckless act, they did.” On
the other hand, if the person shot the fireworks directly into dry grass
to purposefully start a fire, “that would be a malicious arson act” and
considered intentional. (Investigators had initially
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/07/26/park-fire-california-suspect/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>planned</u></a>
to charge Stout, the Park Fire suspect, with intentional arson but
ultimately charged him on Monday with
<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/07/30/california-wildfire-park-fire-arson-charges-updates/74598770007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reckless
arson</u></a>, according to reports.)
</p>
<p>
Cal Fire lumps reckless and intentional arson together in their public
statistics, which
<a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/what-we-do/fire-protection/law-enforcement-and-civil-cost-recovery" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>show
an uptick in arson arrests</u></a> from 61 in 2018 to over 110 every
year since 2020, peaking at 162 in 2022. Muschetto attributes that rise
to the fact that fire seasons have gotten
<a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/longer-more-intense-fire-weather-seasons" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>longer
due to climate change</u></a>, meaning small acts of arson are more
likely to result in fires big enough to warrant resources,
investigations, and arrests. In 2023, for example, Cal Fire’s arson
arrests dipped slightly, potentially because it wasn’t as long or severe
of a fire season in the state.
</p>
<p>
The 2024 season has kicked off relatively normally, and Muschetto said
he expects arson arrests to top 100 but not “break any record number,
hopefully.”
</p>
<p>
The truth, though, is that arson happens “every single day,” Ed
Nordskog, a retired Los Angeles arson investigator and the
<a href="https://www.arsonprofiler.com/services" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>founder</u></a>
of the Serial and Wildland Arson Investigation Training program, told
me. “But most of the year, it’s not conducive to a massive fire because
of the weather and fuel conditions, so nobody gets excited.” Nordskog
disputes reported arson numbers, pointing to the
<a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/topic-pages/arson#:~:text=This%20data%20collection%20does%20not%20include%20any%20estimates%20for%20arson%20because%20the%20degree%20of%20reporting%20arson%20offenses%20varies%20from%20agency%20to%20agency.%20Because%20of%20this%20disparity%20in%20reporting%2C%20arson%20offenses%20are%20excluded%20from%20Tables%201%2D7%2C%20all%20of%20which%20contain%20offense%20estimations." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>inconsistencies
between fire agencies</u></a> and the lack of resources available to
investigate every fire with the thoroughness required to determine its
origin. He estimates that closer to 50% of urban and wildland fires are
caused by arson, though he agrees that number is likely lower when it
comes to wildfires;
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/gary-maynard-professor-arson-trial.html#:~:text=many%20investigators%20believe%20that%E2%80%99s%20an%20undercount" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>many
experts</u></a>, however, admit that the commonly cited 10% statistic is
probably an undercount.
</p>
<p>
Nordskog told me that arson investigators don’t care about the
<em><em>size</em></em> of the fire; they care about the intent of the
person who committed the act. Someone like the Park Fire suspect “didn’t
have the ability to light a big fire; he didn’t have the ability to
light a small fire,” Nordskog said. “He just lit a fire, and he did it
on the wrong day, at the wrong time, in the wrong place, and now you
have a catastrophe.”
</p>
<p>
Nordskog is particularly rankled when people try to connect climate
change to acts of arson, calling it a misconception that hot weather
brings out the firebugs. Arsonists “are there all the time, 24 hours a
day, doing their thing,” including in the winter, Nordskog explained.
But a warmer world has
<a href="https://www.drought.gov/news/study-finds-climate-change-blame-record-breaking-california-wildfires-2023-08-08" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>made
extreme fire conditions more common</u></a>, as have decades of
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fires-destroy-forests/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>misbegotten
fire suppression policies</u></a> in the Western United States. As a
result, arson fires in rural areas are more likely to burn out of
control than they would have been half a century ago. That element of
chance is why Nordskog likes to say that “a wildland arsonist has the
power of a nuclear bomb at their fingertips: They’re the only criminal
in the world that can do that kind of damage.”
</p>
<p>
Most arsonists are one-and-done offenders, and the crime cuts across
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/gary-maynard-professor-arson-trial.html" target="_blank"><u>race,
gender, and education levels</u></a>. Mental illness and drug use can
certainly be exacerbating factors. Additionally, the housing crisis and
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/16/opinion/supreme-court-johnson-case.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>anti-homelessness
legislation</u></a> have
<a href="https://crosscut.com/environment/2021/10/wests-housing-crisis-pushes-unhoused-families-live-forests" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pushed
marginalized populations</u></a> into living in wildland-urban
interfaces, on the fringes of towns and cities, where both intentional
and unintentional fires can cause more extensive problems.
</p>
<p>
Nordskog specializes in serial arsonists — a much smaller subset of
arsonists who set fires repeatedly and intentionally, sometimes hundreds
of times. They can be sophisticated operators, picking “the perfect time
of day” to start a fire when temperatures are high and the wind picks
up; some even use delay ignition devices to avoid getting caught.
“They’re usually very frustrated and angry about something,” Nordskog
said of a motive, and “the one thing that anybody can do is light a
fire.”
</p>
<p>
Nordskog, like Cal Fire’s Muschetto, told me he’s doubtful there is any
significant rise in the number of people actually <em><em>committing
</em></em>arson; discrepancies in investigations, annual fire
conditions, and several other factors are the likelier reason for the
fluctuations in numbers.
</p>
<p>
For Muschetto, though, it defies belief that someone would intentionally
start a fire at all. “It blows my mind that [arson] occurs and how often
it occurs,” Muschetto told me. An arson fire takes firefighters away
from their families for potentially weeks on end; it puts first
responders and the public in danger; and between
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/how-many-people-will-this-smoke-kill" target="_self"><u>the
smoke pollution</u></a>, immense environmental degradation, and
potential loss of life and property, the damage can be incalculable.
</p>
<p>
“We’re always going to get accidental or natural ignitions” in
California, Muschetto said. That’s why “reducing these intentional fires
is very important.”

wind and heat plus risk of thunderstorms expected in fight against
California wildfire</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CHICO, California — Firefighters battling California’s largest
wildfire of the year are preparing for treacherous conditions entering
the weekend when expected thunderstorms may unleash fire-starting
lightning and erratic winds that could erode progress made over the past
week. Dry, hot conditions posed similar threats across the fire-stricken
West.   </p>
<p>Weather, fuels and terrain will pose challenges for the 6,000
firefighters battling the Park Fire, which has spread over 614 square
miles (1,590 square kilometers) since allegedly being started by arson
in a wilderness park in the Sierra Nevada foothills east of the
Sacramento Valley city of Chico.  </p>
<p>The fire’s push northward has brought it toward the rugged lava rock
landscape surrounding Lassen Volcanic National Park, which has been
closed due to the threat.  </p>
<p>“Lava rocks make for hard and slow work for hand crews,” Cal Fire
said in a situation report. “Crews are being flown into access areas
that have been hard to reach because of long drive times and steep,
rugged terrain.”  </p>
<p>After days of benign weather, increasing winds and a surge of
monsoonal moisture were expected to increase fire activity and bring a
chance of thunderstorms Friday night into Saturday, said Ryan Walbrun,
incident meteorologist with the National Weather Service.  </p>
<p>“The concern with thunderstorms is any gusty outflow winds that would
push the fire itself or create some new fire ignitions within the
vicinity of the Park Fire,” Walbrun said. </p>
<p>Collapse of thunderstorm clouds can blow wind in any and all
directions, said Jonathan Pangburn, a fire behavior analyst with Cal
Fire.  </p>
<p>“Even if there’s not lightning per se, it is very much a
safety-watch-out environment for our firefighters out there,” Pangburn
said. </p>
<p>Walbrun said there was little prospect of beneficial rains from the
storms and the forecast for next week calls for continued warming and
drying.  </p>
<p>“As we look forward in time, we’re really just entering the peak of
fire season in California,” he said.  </p>
<p>The Park Fire, which has destroyed at least 480 structures and
damaged 47, is one of almost 100 large fires burning across the western
U.S.   </p>
<p>A wildfire on the edge of metro Denver crept within a quarter-mile of
evacuated homes, but authorities said Thursday they were hopeful that
hundreds of threatened residences could be saved despite sweltering
temperatures and firefighters suffering heat exhaustion.  </p>

encroached on several large subdivisions. Neighborhoods with nearly 600
homes were ordered to evacuate after the fire, of unknown origin, spread
quickly Tuesday afternoon and overnight when relatively few firefighters
were yet on the scene. </p>
<p>Jim and Meg Lutes watched from an overlook near their house northeast
of the fire as smoke plumed up from the ridges. Their community west of
Littleton was not yet under evacuation orders, but the couple had been
ready to start packing a day earlier when flames could be seen
blanketing the mountains.   </p>
<p>“It can come over that hill pretty quick if the wind changes,” said
Jim Lutes, 64, pointing to a nearby ridge.  </p>
<p>Five firefighters were injured Wednesday, including four who had heat
exhaustion, said Mark Techmeyer, a spokesperson with the Jefferson
County Sheriff’s Office.  </p>
<p>The fire was in steep terrain that made it difficult to access but
had been held to about a half-square mile (1.4 square kilometers) with
no houses yet destroyed, authorities said.  </p>
<p>Miles to the north near the city of Lyons, Colorado, officials lifted
some evacuations and reported making progress on the Stone Canyon Fire.
It has killed one person and destroyed five houses. The cause was under
investigation. </p>
<p>The fire was among several threatening heavily populated areas of the
Colorado foothills, including one in which a person was killed earlier
this week.  </p>
<p>New, large fires were reported in Idaho, southeastern Montana and
north Texas.  </p>
<p>Scientists say extreme wildfires are becoming more common and
destructive in the U.S. West and other parts of the world as climate
change warms the planet and droughts become more severe.</p>

<h2 id="technology-history-where-unix-came-from">Technology history:
where Unix came from</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today, every Unix-like system can trace their ancestry back to the
original Unix. That includes Linux, which uses the GNU tools – and the
GNU tools are based on the Unix tools. Linux in 2024 is removed from the
original Unix design, and for good reason – Linux supports architectures
and tools not dreamt of during the original Unix era. But the core
command line experience in Linux is still very similar to the Unix
command line of the 1970s. The next time you use ls to list the files in
a directory, remember that you’re using a command line that’s been with
us for more than fifty years. ↫ Jim Hall An excellent overview of some
of the more ancient UNIX commands that are still with us today. One
thing I always appreciate when I dive into an operating system closer to
“real” UNIX, like OpenBSD, or a actual UNIX, like HP-UX, is just how
much more logical sense they make under the hood than a Linux system
does. This is not a dunk on modern Linux – it has to cater to endless
more modern needs than something ancient and dead like HP-UX – but what
I learn while using these systems closer to the UNIX has made me
appreciate proper UNIX more than I used to in the past. In what surely
sounds like utter lunacy to system administrators who actually had to
seriously administer HP-UX systems back in the day, I genuinely love
using HP-UX, setting it up, configuring it, messing around with it,
because it just makes so much more logical sense than the systems we use
today. The knowledge gained from using BSD, HP-UX, and others, while not
always directly applicable to Linux, does aid me in understanding
certain Linux things better than I did before. What I’m trying to say is
– go and load up an old UNIX, or at least a modern BSD. Aside from being
great operating systems in their own right, they’re much easier to grasp
than a modern Linux system, and you’ll learn a lot form the
experience.</p>

tumble, led by 5.8% drop in Tokyo following a tech-driven retreat on
Wall Street</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BANGKOK — Shares in Europe and Asia tumbled Friday, with Japan’s
Nikkei 225 index slumping 5.8% as investors panicked over signs of
weakness in the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>Bracing for a highly anticipated employment report coming on Friday,
the future for the S&amp;P 500 was down 1.3%, while that for the Dow
Jones Industrial Average sank 0.9%.</p>
<p>The declines followed a retreat on Wall Street after weak
manufacturing data raised worries the Federal Reserve may have waited
too long to cut interest rates, raising risks of a recession. After the
U.S. central bank held steady at a meeting this week, Fed Chair Jerome
Powell said a cut could come in September.</p>
<p>“The short-lived satisfaction of Fed Chief Powell communicating
decent odds of a September rate cut has turned sour as investors are now
panicking that the central bank isn’t trimming soon enough,” José
Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers, said in a report.</p>
<p>A nearly 19% decline in Intel’s shares in aftermarket trading
deepened the gloom. The chipmaker said it was cutting 15% of its massive
workforce — about 15,000 jobs — to better compete with more successful
rivals like Nvidia and AMD.</p>
<p>In early European trading, Germany’s DAX shed 1.5% to 17,806.65,
while the CAC 40 slipped 1% to 7,298.81. In London, the FTSE 100 fell
0.6% to 8,233.49.</p>
<p>Japan’s market retreated to where it was trading in January before it
surged to an all-time high last month of over 42,000. The Nikkei 225
lost 2,216.63 points Friday to 35,909.70, with banks’,
technology-related and manufacturers’ shares hit by heavy selling.</p>
<p>The Nikkei has lost 6.2% in the past three months.</p>
<p>Japanese shares were pummeled after the central bank raised its
benchmark interest rate on Wednesday, to 0.25% from 0.1%. That pushed
the value of the Japanese yen higher against the U.S. dollar,
potentially hurting overseas earnings of major manufacturers and
deflating a boom in tourism.</p>
<p>The dollar fell to 148.77 yen early Friday from 149.37 yen late
Thursday. It had recently traded above 160 yen. The euro rose to $1.0820
from $1.0789.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Asia on Friday, Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropped 2.1% to
16,945.51, while the Shanghai Composite index saw a more modest loss, of
0.9% to 2,905.34.</p>
<p>Chinese shares have extended losses this week as investors registered
disappointment with the government’s latest efforts to spur growth
through various piecemeal measures, instead of hoped-for infusions of
broader stimulus.</p>
<p>The Kospi in Seoul dropped 3.7% to 2,676.19 and Taiwan’s Taiex sank
4.4%. Both markets tend to be hit hard by weakness in technology
shares.</p>
<p>South Korea’s Samsung Electronics dropped 4.2% while another maker of
computer chips and other components, SK Hynix, dropped 10.4%. Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s largest chip maker, lost
5.9%.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Asia, Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX gave up 2.1% to 7,943.20
and the Sensex in India was down 1.1%. Bangkok’s SET fell 0.7%.</p>
<p>It has been a nerve wracking week for markets even as central banks
in Japan, the United States and England acted much as had been expected.
Japan raised its benchmark, the Fed stood pat, and the Bank of England
lowered its key rate by 0.25%, to 5%, its first cut in more than four
years.</p>
<p>Commodity prices have also had a rough ride, with oil prices surging
after the killings of leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah that fueled fears
conflict in the Middle East might escalate into a wider war. But prices
fell back Thursday and were only marginally higher early Friday.</p>
<p>Benchmark U.S. crude oil gained 12 cents to $76.43 per barrel. Brent
crude, the international standard, was up 12 cents at $79.64 per
barrel.</p>
<p>The price of gold, a traditional refuge for investors in uncertain
times, has surged to over $2,500 an ounce.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other commodities sank on concerns that weakness in the
U.S. and other major economies will hurt demand. The price of nickel
dropped 2.4%, aluminum dropped 1% and copper traded in New York dropped
2.3%.</p>
<p>Worry is mounting that the Fed has kept its main interest rate at a
two-decade high for too long in its zeal to stifle inflation by making
it more costly to borrow. A rate cut could take months to a year to
filter through the economy.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 sank 1.4% after a report from the
Institute for Supply Management showed U.S. manufacturing activity is
still shrinking. The Dow fell 1.2%, and the Nasdaq composite dropped
2.3%. The small stocks in the Russell 2000 index dropped 3%.</p>
<p>Other reports Thursday showed the number of U.S. workers applying for
jobless benefits hit its highest level in about a year and that
productivity for U.S. workers improved in the spring. The data are
likely to relieve pressure on inflation and give the Fed more leeway to
cut rates.</p>
<p>Employment growth does appear to be slowing more than expected,
Philip Marey, senior U.S. strategist for Rabobank, said in a
commentary.</p>
<p>“This suggests that the Fed’s strategy to bring better balance
between labor demand and supply through restrictive interest rates is
working, but of course the risk is that employment growth is brought to
a halt and the economy slides into a recession.”</p>

solar plants (many stuck in permitting and interconnection delays) have

To that end, PJM will offer record-high payments to power plant
operators for the capacity they agree to maintain next delivery year.
Producers across the region can expect to earn $269.92 per megawatt if
they commit to being available during predetermined times, with prices
in certain locations reaching as high as $466.35 per megawatt-day. Grid
operators hope this will encourage the construction of new generating
assets.

PJM’s quagmire is also a warning to other transmission organizations and

model potential energy savings from different courses of action, like
new insulation, windows, doors, or even a new heating and cooling

report</a> by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis
suggests that the term — meant to convey the infrastructure’s capability
to transition to carbon-free hydrogen when the fuel becomes more
available — may be little more than hot air. It identifies three major
barriers: a lack of hydrogen supply, a lack of hydrogen-capable
pipelines, and a lack of storage capacity. The authors highlight Duke
Energy’s plan to build a “hydrogen-ready” gas turbine at an existing
coal plant in Roxboro, North Carolina — a plan that wouldn’t introduce
hydrogen into the pipeline until 2035, and even then would start with a
mix of just 1% hydrogen to 99% methane.
</p>
<p>
Claims of hydrogen readiness, the report concludes, are “little more
than marketing designed to obscure the myriad shortcomings and
unanswered questions associated with using hydrogen in methane-fired
turbines.”

<li>A new financing tool aims to accelerate coal retirements
</h3>
<p>
On the back of a record year for coal consumption driven by demand in
Asia, climate advocates are searching for new ways to hasten the decline
of the carbon-intensive fuel. One problem that has long bedeviled
effort: Shutting down a coal plant prematurely means forfeiting years of
profit. This amounts to a premium of $310 million for a five-year
premature retirement,
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-01/new-tool-to-close-down-asia-s-coal-plants-is-gaining-momentum?srnd=green&sref=uFaJcogC&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8r5QPhBEL0z93heKvr2hx--tLpbSUfRlxOQQ0tzlFQw67aSfbbMyV0L6U-mr-gp8bW1zce" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according
to one estimate</a>.
</p>
<p>
A group of financial institutions led by the Monetary Authority of
Singapore is exploring a new financial tool to get around that barrier.
The idea is to allow people and companies to purchase “transition
credits” like they purchase carbon offsets. The money from these
purchases would reimburse coal plant operators for the money they stand
to lose by shutting down their plants. Some big banks see transition
credits as a growth market. “We would also like to see how these can be
traded, as creating a liquid secondary market should help support the
primary markets too,” Patrick Lee, Standard Chartered’s chief executive
officer for Singapore and ASEAN, told

We’re in the middle of another heat wave, which can make cooler parts of
the country seem more attractive. And a new analysis shows that some
Americans are reversing migration patterns. Typically, people are
leaving colder states for warmer ones. Now, more Americans are staying
put, while others are moving from warmer places to cooler ones. But
first: Markets tumble as investors blink before The Fed does.

<h2>
Let’s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?
</h2>
<p>
Hello! My name is Anne Sturdivant, you will often find me online as
“Apple Annie” or using the handle <code>anniegreens</code>. I give a
little background on these names on my weblog:
<a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/01/origins-of-a-nickname">Origins
of a nickname</a>. I am originally from Washington state in the US but
have lived in Portland, OR, for about 20 years.
</p>
<p>
I moved to Portland to attend college (for the second time) and studied
web design and interactive media, for which I received a BS. I continued
on that course for my career for the last 16 years, working mainly on
the front-end with Drupal, design systems, and structured content. I
recently have been on a hiatus from full-time work due to health (and
other) factors. I am still active in the front-end and web design
spaces, also more recently jumping back into “work” on a personal level.
</p>
<p>
Hobbies are hard to define since so many things I enjoy doing and could
categorize as hobbies are just a core part of me. I am a gardener but
calling that a hobby feels like an understatement. My entire yard is a
garden and I put every single plant in the ground. I post many photos
and write a bit about it more on my
<a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol">microblog</a> than my weblog. I
also travel to gardens in the Pacific Northwest and take photos and
write about it in a newsletter that has been on hold for a while. I do
plan on resuming this newsletter at some point, platform to be
determined.
</p>
<p>
I also watch a fair amount of movies and television, mostly on streaming
services, though I don’t write about that much. I love listening to
podcasts and find myself gravitating towards the weird and unusual,
tech-related and front-end, US political news (though not what you might
think, I really only listen to serious lawyers that don’t get into
hyperbolic punditry), and health-related and local subjects.
</p>
<p>
I read but am not a dedicated book reader, I find myself more drawn to
blogs and the interlinking nature of the web. I do usually start this
path in my RSS reader but very often a trail starts on Mastodon due to a
post someone shares. I enjoy photography and hiking and visiting natural
areas in the Pacific Northwest, also featured in my newsletter, but do
less of that now (except photos of my garden) due to current health
limitations.
</p>
<p>
I suppose you could call tinkering with front-end development a hobby as
well, since nowadays I’m doing that for personal pleasure and growth,
even if I am trained to do that as a career as well. I find this to be a
creative outlet as much as other creative endeavors, including
gardening, and I’ve written in the past about how I find both gardening
and front-end development to share some of the same parts of my brain.
</p>
<p>
Finally, this “hobby” should lead us right into the next question:
blogging!
</p>
<h2>
What’s the story behind your blog?
</h2>
<p>
I have several blogs, it might be an addiction. I’ve written pretty
extensively about my weblog, which I consider my main blog, and how it
came to be. Part of my hiatus and worsening health issues were due to
work-induced burnout and I spent several years away from the web, unsure
I’d ever return. In 2022 I started to have the desire to once again do
<em>something</em> on the web, though I was unsure what that would look
like. I had a blog in college but long abandoned it, though it still
sits on the same domain my old portfolio site sits on, locked behind a
login.
</p>
<p>
After coming to Mastodon, I discovered an instance that was part of a
paid suite of tools,
<a href="https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/anniegreens">omg.lol</a>, and
signed up after finding the Local timeline to be quite enjoyable (it’s
now my main instance). What I didn’t realize was that the rest of the
tools would become just as important to me. I first created a “link
page” that now acts as my global profile, then a /now page, and a
weblog, and a statuslog, and soon had also signed up for Micro.blog. I
now have nine blogs, seven of them active, spread across omg.lol and
Micro.blog.
</p>
<p>
As I said, the <a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol">weblog</a> is my
main blog and started as a way to get back into doing front-end
development again and to write about it and the process of customizing
the blog. I really started it for myself, to work my way out of burnout,
as a means of therapy. I now post mostly longer form, often technical,
posts about front-end development and web design, the indieweb,
blogging, the internet, as well as some more personal pieces, and still
the process of working on the blog.
</p>
<p>
I’d then consider my
<a href="https://micro.anniegreens.lol">microblog</a> a close second to
the weblog. I post more short form content there, photo-blogging,
bookmarks, gardening, chronic illness, as well as some politics and
technology. I sometimes cross-post to one of my four Mastodon accounts.
</p>
<p>
My other blogs are more projects than traditional blogs. I have a trio
of blogs that serve as one project for
<a href="https://weblog.lol">weblog.lol</a>:
<a href="https://themes.lol">Themes</a>,
<a href="https://styles.themes.lol">Styles</a>, and
<a href="https://custom.themes.lol">Custom</a>, which I use exclusively
for weblog.lol styles and customizations to create themes. This work is
on hold right now as weblog.lol’s backend will be seeing some overhaul
over the next few months and I’ll need to reflect that there.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://3x5.pics">3x5.pics</a> is a fun project that I loved
designing. I’m currently authoring all the messages on the notecards
myself but I would like to open it up to submissions one day. Right now
I’m working on the <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">100 Days to
Offload</a> challenge on a dedicated blog called
<a href="https://100daysof.blog">100 Days of Blog</a>. Another microblog
I haven’t started yet, other than to obtain a domain and have a
direction for it, will be for testing and modernizing a trove of old
recipes I inherited from my grandmother. It is called Table for One
Cafe. Finally, I have a sixth weblog.lol blog that I’m working to make a
place for front-end experiments that I can include with blog posts on my
main weblog. This is code named Tiny Pages.
</p>
<h2>
What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?
</h2>
<p>
For posts on my weblog, they are usually about something I worked on or
a process/knowledge piece to share. For this type of post I put in a
fair amount of research on a subject, create an outline, prepare assets
or code samples, and citations and footnotes. These very often are about
working on one of my blogs, adding a new feature, updating and improving
something technical, or learning a modern and new piece of functionality
within front-end development.
</p>
<p>
Personal pieces are far more spontaneous and may reflect how I am
feeling or a struggle I am dealing with. Other posts are reactions to
blog posts, articles, podcasts, and movies or television shows. I also
try to post a near-daily featured photo on my microblog. Sometimes these
are curated ahead of time, where I’ll plan out a week of photos, but
often they are a picture that the Apple Photos.app is featuring that
day. I thought about the kinds of blogs posts once and
<a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/11/types-of-blog-posts">wrote
something about it</a>, I’m not sure I’ve hit all of them yet!
</p>
<p>
I had many requests from the omg.lol community about what my weblog
workflow was so I published a piece aptly titled
<a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/04/weblog-publishing-workflow"><em>Weblog
Publishing Workflow</em></a>. In it I describe the tools I use,
including <a href="https://getdrafts.com/">Drafts</a>, which I am
writing these answers in right now. As far as how many drafts I write, I
really can’t tell you. The way Drafts works I never see a “draft”
version, I’m just constantly reading and rewriting or reorganizing
sections. One of the nice part of Drafts is being able to set up preview
templates that look exactly like the front-end of your blog, using all
the same assets, which I have stored on a CDN. When I read a piece for
editing, I read it in that preview as it gives me the best feeling of
how something will be seen once published on my weblog.
</p>
<p>
As for proof reading or asking for help in reviewing what I blog about,
I haven’t yet started to do that, but the idea has been in my mind for a
while. I know I make mistakes and I will often find at least a couple
after publishing, but I am not too worried about that. I’m fine airing
my bumps and bruises. I would, however, appreciate a review on more
technical pieces that I write in the future and may start looking for
someone I trust to do that or that is willing to offer their time.
</p>
<h2>
Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the
physical space influences your creativity?
</h2>
<p>
I usually write in the morning or later at night, often with a cup of
coffee or tea, nestled into my large chair with ottoman in my living
room. I have a proper (and rather nice) office and I worked from home
for many years at my last job, but I’ve since moved away from that
strict feeling space for blogging or creative endeavors, unless I need
an external monitor for something large or complicated that I want to
see in a code editor or graphics program.
</p>
<p>
One thing that definitely influences my ability to write is sound. I
don’t necessarily mean I need to listen to music to be creative or to
write, but if there is sound it cannot be dialogue or lyrics with music.
For this reason I primarily listen to two highly curated Pandora
stations I created many years ago. I also listen to them while working
on design or technical projects, though often I prefer no sound at all.
</p>
<p>
If I’m already in the flow of something, either writing or working on a
site or design, I will often listen to music, but also from one of those
Pandora stations. I’ve been listening to them for so long, they are like
a comfortable friend and may therefore help me feel at ease. I know
creative spaces are important.
</p>
<p>
When I moved to Portland to attend an art college, I lived in a very
inspiring neighborhood near my school and felt like a creative’s dream
every time I stepped onto the sidewalk. Now when I am stuck on something
I find that just stepping out my back door into my garden is enough of
an escape that when I return I can get past that block. In 2019 when I
was at the worst of my burnout I planted a pollinator garden in my
raised vegetable beds and could spend hours out there gazing at the
flowers and wildlife. It was therapeutic, got the creative juices
flowing, and a means to make the day pass.
</p>
<h2>
A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech
stack?
</h2>
<p>
I assume most people answering these questions may run across the same
thing as myself: I have written about this on my blog before. My weblog
<a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/colophon">Colophon</a> details
much of this. The weblog is using
<a href="https://weblog.lol">weblog.lol</a>, a small blogging platform
that comes with an
<a href="https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/anniegreens">omg.lol</a>
address. There is a lightweight templating system that allows passing of
variables with front-matter and config and authoring in Markdown and
HTML, or a combination of the two.
</p>
<p>
All static assets are stored on my <a href="https://bunny.net/cdn/">CDN
at Bunny.net</a>, the domain is registered at and DNS is currently
managed by <a href="https://porkbun.com/">Porkbun</a> but I may moved to
Bunny.net for DNS as well, which would serve weblog as a static site.
Email for my domain is handled by
<a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a>. I have just recently
added a contact form using
<a href="https://letterbird.co/">Letterbird</a>. Analytics are using
<a href="https://tinylytics.app/">Tinylytics</a> for the time being,
though I am investigating self-hosting Umami for analytics with
PikaPods.
</p>
<p>
The theme is entirely custom CSS and HTML with limited Javascript for
theme switching and some web components. I mention in my workflow post
that I desired to use a platform and workflow that didn’t require a lot
of maintenance overhead, such as updating modules, dependencies, and
debugging build systems. I wanted the platform to get out of the way so
I could work on the parts I want to work on and write about it. I love
that there are so many diverse ways to blog right now, so many different
options for complexity based on what people want to do or can do. And
opportunities to do more when they want to and move to another platform
as they need more features. There is no wrong way to blog and the best
way is the way that makes it easiest for you.
</p>
<p>
My microblog is hosted on <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a>
and uses a community contributed theme called Tiny Theme as a base with
custom CSS, some Javascript for web components, and template overrides
to complement the look and feel of my weblog’s theme. My other
projects/blogs are also on one of these platforms: Themes, Styles, and
Custom use weblog.lol; 3x5.pics and Tiny Pages use weblog.lol; and both
100 Days of Blog and Table for One Cafe are on Micro.blog.
</p>
<h2>
Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do
anything differently?
</h2>
<p>
If I started over today, I’d be in a different head space and I like to
think I would have “branched out” more and relied on my web development
experience to build something more custom using 11ty or another static
site generator. I have more experience with PHP so I might have gone in
the direction of a PHP static site generator, but I appreciate and stay
updated with what is happening with 11ty enough that I think I will end
up using that some day.
</p>
<p>
Weblog.lol has some limitations and though I have gotten very far with
truly making it my own, I started the blog in January 2023, I’ve only
just started hitting walls that I am unable to get past due to the
platform’s limitations. The next version of weblog will run on a new
backend called Neato and I am willing to wait until that is ready to try
out before making any moves to another platform.
</p>
<p>
I think it more likely I leave Micro.blog before I leave weblog.lol (or
<a href="https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/anniegreens">omg.lol</a>). The
original needs I had when I joined Micro.blog have either ended up being
something I decided I didn’t need (Fediverse integration), or I’ve found
alternatives to some of its functionality (cross-posting), and the
remaining piece I’ve yet to get set up, a newsletter, I already have
options, such as Buttondown or Ghost, that I could use.
</p>
<p>
I am still very pleased with the structure of my weblog. I believe
starting with a Styleguide up front helped me to keep styling consistent
by structuring the content and front-matter properly from fairly early
on. The only structure that I find lacking is, again, due to the
platform’s limitations. Having come from more than a decade of working
on Drupal platforms, I can see gaps in functionality that other
platforms might give me the flexibility to fill.
</p>
<p>
As for the name of my weblog, I’m glad this was brought up in the
suggestions—I <em>love</em> when a blog has a name! I curate a blogroll
by “spinning” it with nine new blogs at a time at no particular
regularity. In the process of doing so I come across the “name” of each
blog by peaking at the HTML <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and I am always
delighted to find when someone takes the time or creative effort to put
a little gem in there that you may not otherwise know about. I wrote a
<a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/give-your-blog-a-name">blog
post</a> about this once and I still think the blog I name in that post
is still my favorite name. As for my blog’s name(s), well, I have so
many of them, I’m getting to scratch that naming itch!
</p>
<h2>
Financial question since the Web is obsessed with money: how much does
it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost, or does it generate some
revenue? And what’s your position on people monetising personal blogs?
</h2>
<p>
Since I have so many blogs I’m going to break this into each platform’s
costs along with additional costs for related services.
</p>
<h3>
Weblog, 3x5.pics, Themes/Styles/Custom, Tiny Pages
</h3>
<p>
All six of these blogs are omg.lol addresses. A one year subscription
for all the tools and goodies
<a href="https://home.omg.lol/referred-by/anniegreens">omg.lol</a>
offers is $20USD. Sometimes there are deals (very often, multiple times
a year) and you can also gain banks of time through referrals. So
although, the cost of these would normally be $120USD per year combined,
I don’t actually pay that much right now. I have also bought banks of
time during promotional deals, so that helps as well. Each of these
addresses comes with multiple tools and web presences that are
infinitely configurable, so you gain quite a lot for a fairly low price.
On top of that it is a lovely welcoming community run by a really nice
guy, and I’m not just saying that.
</p>
<h3>
Microblog, 100 Days of Blog, Table for One Cafe
</h3>
<p>
A Micro.blog premium membership gets you up to five blogs plus a whole
other host of goodies, such as podcasting, newsletter functionality,
Fediverse integration, cross-posting, bookmarking, and more. The cost of
the premium memership is $10USD per month. A non-premium membership with
just one blog, plus cross-posting, and a few other goodies, is $5USD per
month.
</p>
<h3>
Related Services
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://porkbun.com">Porkbun</a> handles all five of my
domains. I got a deal on most of them for the first year. If all five of
them were to renew at the same time at the estimated costs it would be
roughly $115USD for another year.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://tinylytics.app">Tinylytics</a> is currently the
lightweight analytics I use. There is a free tier, a monthly tier, and a
yearly tier. I am currently on the yearly plan and paying $50USD per
year. I am looking into moving to self-hosting Umami through PikaPods
and that would be slightly more.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://bunny.net/cdn">Bunny.net CDN</a> is a pay-as-you-go
service, so I don’t have exact figures to give, but I can try to
estimate. I serve all my domain’s static assets, except for the
Micro.blog sites which have their own storage. For March 2023 through
June 2024 I paid $60-70 for the CDN + optimization on one of the storage
zones, so that is less than $10USD per month at my current rate of
traffic, which does vary from month-to-month.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://echofeed.app">EchoFeed</a> Pro (Prami’s Version) is an
ad hoc cross-posting service. There is a free plan that allows for one
feed. The Pro plan gives you unlimited feeds and the “Prami’s Version”
is a small discount for omg.lol members. The creator of this service is
an omg.lol member. I pay $20USD per year.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://letterbird.co">Letterbird</a> Pro is a contact form
with customizations. The free plan has less options and no CSS
customizations. I pay $10USD per month for the Pro plan. I am using it
on two of my sites.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://flickr.com">Flickr</a> Pro is listed here because I do
use Flickr hosted images quite often on my main Microblog due to the
image quality and automatic resizing available, which I use to craft
responsive images in some posts. Flickr Pro is $72.99USD per year with
unlimited storage and full resolution.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
On the subject of monetization, I don’t think I have any issue with it.
I don’t enjoy ads, but I don’t mind unobtrusive methods of helping to
support independent creators. I have a Buy me a coffee button on my blog
at the bottom of every page. It rarely gets used, though I wouldn’t mind
it got used more (obviously 😆) to help support the cost of my
infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
I think if you find value in something someone creates there is no shame
in giving them some money to show appreciation and encourage them to
keep it up. Many people have stressful jobs and the creative output they
get via writing or doing other art and coding on their blogs may be
payment enough, but they still absolutely appreciate when someone shows
support monetarily. I try to give when I can, especially if I find
myself going back to a person over and over for things they create to
give away or for writing that has helped me.
</p>
<h2>
Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out?
And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?
</h2>
<p>
This feels just as loaded as creating a blogroll! Which I took a
different route in that I cannot and will not just choose a handful of
people, especially since we all tend to get caught up in silos and add
people that look and sound like us. My blogroll is an ever changing list
that I “spin” with nine new blogs at a time when I’ve collected enough
blogs to round out a diverse selection of bloggers and types of blogs.
</p>
<p>
These three suggestions come off my blogroll, any of them would be good
candidates for your next interview that I would be very interested in
reading.
</p>
<ul>
<li>

<h2>
Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?
</h2>
<p>
Okay, this is admittedly a smorgasbord of links, but I think they’re all
great. How do you choose just a handful of what the web has to offer?
For me, these are things I’ve thought about and looked at recently.
Three of these items I submitted for a
<a href="https://tinyawards.net/">Tiny Award</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.igalia.com/chats/">Igalia Chats</a><br /> I really
enjoy this podcast. It combines two of my most favorite front-end
topics: CSS and accessibility and is co-hosted by one of the all-time
most influential figures in CSS: Eric Meyer.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.oddbird.net/talks/">Oddbird past and upcoming talks
&amp; workshops</a><br /> I’m always looking for new front-end content
to watch or listen to. I was recently on a quest to find front-end
podcasts and wasn’t as successful as I hoped but I came across other
resources. This Oddbird resource is really great, featuring upcoming and
past talks &amp; workshops by the esteemed team at Oddbird, notably
Miriam Suzanne.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://slashpages.net/">Slash Pages</a><br /> This is another
fun project by Robb Knight. If you’re just building a blog or looking
for ways to add new content that isn’t necessarily blog posts but still
represent you and your ideas, “slash pages” are a great way to do that.
I’m still on my way to achieving “slash pages totality” but I have
<a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/slashes">quite a selection</a>
already.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://reply.cards/">Reply Cards</a><br /> A small project by
Adam Newbold, creator of omg.lol. Reply cards are what they sound like:
“Answer messages without having to write a personal response.” Choose
from the existing library of cards or create your own for a couple bucks
and avoid that uncomfortable response you’d rather not have to make!
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://3x5.pics">3x5.pics</a><br /> A project I recently
completed but still have plans for some updates and improvements, namely
accepting submissions for new entries.
<a href="https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2024/03/creating-3x5-pics">Read
a little write-up on the project</a>.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://buttondown.email/ericwbailey/archive/">Eric Bailey’s
newsletter: SC 2.4.4</a><br /> You will find many newsletters to
subscribe to but Eric’s is one of my favorites. Somehow curating a
diverse list of links to articles and information that always interest
me. Some front-end, some web or tech, some unusual and bizarre, always
relevant to our times, and often shocking and humbling.

<p class="drop-caps">
Mornings are my time for thinking about Rob Jackson — specifically, when
I am making coffee. Every time I reach for the knob on my gas stove to
heat my water kettle, I remember something he told me during our
discussion of his new book,
<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9781668023266" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Into
the Clear Blue Sky: The Path to Restoring Our
Atmosphere</em></em></u></a>: “We would never willingly stand over the
tailpipe of a car breathing in the exhaust, yet we willingly stand over
a stove, breathing the exact same pollutants.”
</p>
<p>
Mornings, incidentally, are also my time for practicing holding my
breath.
</p>
<p>
Jackson is the chair of the
<a href="https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Global
Carbon Project</u></a>, a professor of Earth science and a senior fellow
at Stanford University’s Woods Institute for the Environment and
Precourt Institute for Energy, as well as one of the most highly-cited
climate and environmental scientists in the world — all a long way of
saying, he spends a <em><em>lot </em></em>of time thinking about
kitchens and neighborhoods just like mine. But emissions aren’t the only
thing that occupies Jackson’s time these days; while he stresses that
reducing emissions is still the “cheapest, safest, and only sure path to
a safe climate,” his book also reluctantly examines technologies that
remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere after they’ve been emitted.
“In truth, I’m frustrated … because we shouldn’t need them,” he
explains.
</p>
<p>
Ahead of the release of <em><em>Into the Clear Blue Sky</em></em> on
July 30, I spoke with Jackson about why it’s so difficult to make people
care about atmospheric restoration in the same way they care about
habitat loss or extreme weather, and the stories, people, and emerging
technologies that <em><em>do </em></em>make him hopeful. Our
conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>In the introduction to </strong><em><strong><em>Into the Clear
Blue Sky</em></strong></em><strong>, you write that restoring the
atmosphere “must invoke the same spirit and philosophy used to restore
endangered species and habitats to health.” But unlike with polar bears
or glaciers, we
</strong><a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/ground-level-ozone" target="_self"><u><strong>usually</strong></u></a><strong>
can’t see the damage to the atmosphere. Do you think that is part of why
we’ve been so slow and halting in addressing greenhouse gas
pollution?</strong>
</p>
<p>
A little bit, I do. I think the real reason we’ve been slow to address
greenhouse gas pollution is because we are better at just continuing
with the status quo. We aren’t making changes in our lifestyles and our
industries. I’ve grown skeptical that people will respond to climate
thresholds like 1.5 [degrees Celsius of warming] or 2 C. People don’t
really understand why those numbers are important — they don’t
understand what they mean in paleo-time, in terms of sea level rise and
ice melt. I’m seeking a different motivator, a different narrative for
change. And I think restoration is a more powerful narrative than some
arbitrary temperature number.
</p>
<p>
<strong>There are several moments in the book where you suggest that
decarbonization has benefits beyond just addressing climate change —
like how feeding cows red seaweed accelerates their weight gain, or how
electric motorcycles don’t have the fumes, vibrations, or noise of
gas-powered motorcycles. Do you think we need to market green
technologies in ways that go beyond just cleaning up the
atmosphere?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Yes. Approximately half the population in the United States isn’t
motivated by concerns about climate change, and we have to reach them a
different way. I strongly believe that climate solutions won’t just help
our grandchildren; they’ll help make us healthier today, and ultimately
help us save money.
</p>
<p>
Air pollution is the best example: Our air is cleaner today than when I
was a boy. So is our water. But there are 100,000 Americans who still
die from coal and car pollution every year in the United States, and one
in five people worldwide — that’s 10 billion people a year who die from
fossil fuel pollution. Those deaths are unnecessary and senseless. We
have cleaner technologies available now. So if we can help people see
that clean energy and climate solutions will restore our water and air,
they might be more likely to say, “Okay, let’s give it a try.”
</p>
<p>
<strong>CO2 and methane are the big villains of the book, but I noticed
that you don’t tangle with nitrous oxide too much. Was there any
thinking behind that decision?</strong>
</p>
<p>
The problem with nitrous oxide is there are fewer things that we can do
to reduce emissions. The number one source of nitrous oxide pollution —
which causes about 10% of global warming, it’s not a trivial amount — is
nitrogen fertilization for our crops. It’s a very complicated discussion
when you get into growing food for people around the world, especially
in poor countries, and climate change caused by resource consumption in
richer countries. The issues are more complicated, and the solution set
is smaller.
</p>
<p>
<strong>In your chapter about hydrogen — which you express some doubts
about — you say it’s not your job as a scientist to “pick winners and
losers.” I’m curious about these moments of tension between your
personal opinions and your position as a scientist. When do you speak
up, and when do you choose to stand back?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I wish I had a perfect answer to that. I speak more often now than I did
earlier in my career. I feel that we’ve run out of time. There’s more
urgency today. I feel like I no longer have the luxury of just letting
the data speak. I want to try to help people understand the available
solutions and the things that we can do individually and systematically.
</p>
<p>
To succeed in the fight against climate change, we will, I think, need
to accept solutions that are not our favorites. And that’s a difficult
message. People tend to fight everything they’re not 100% happy with,
but the climate is not going to be fixed by any single solution.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The part of your book that made me the most anxious was the
chapter about methane leaks, where you’re driving around Boston taking
air samples and having the methane sensors go off all over the place. It
also reminds me of the chapter on indoor air pollution and how many of
these forms of pollution are so passive — like methane quietly leaking
into our homes or up from under our streets. </strong>
</p>
<p>
The city home work has been really interesting, and it’s consumed a lot
of recent years of my life — much more than I expected it to. And yet
the biggest surprise of our methane work in the homes was how slow but
consistent leaks from appliances like stoves and the pipes in people’s
walls produced more pollution than the methane that leaked when the
appliances were on. And that’s because the appliance might be on for an
hour a day, but for <em><em>23 hours</em></em> a day, the slow bleed of
methane continues to the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
It isn’t passive, though. The pollutants we document include NOx gases
that trigger asthma. Benzene, formed in flames, is a carcinogen. We
would never willingly stand over the tailpipe of a car breathing in the
exhaust, yet we willingly stand over a stove, breathing the exact same
pollutants, day after day, meal after meal, year after year.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Your book takes readers to many places worldwide. Is there any
one project or organization that stands out to you as particularly
exciting or crucial?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I very much enjoyed learning about green steel manufacturing. The
chapter that I enjoyed the most, though, was the trip to Finland [to see
the work of the
<a href="https://www.landscaperewilding.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Snowchange
Cooperative</u></a>, a landscape restoration group]. What I liked about
that project, first of all, was seeing people taking matters into their
own hands and working for solutions. But what was so interesting for me
was the idea of “rewilding,” in the European sense — they’re not
interested in trying to recreate an exact replica of something that was
present in 1900. They’re trying to restore a functioning ecosystem that
will still be there in 100 years. It’s a beautiful sight and the message
was very moving for me.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The book vacillates between optimism and a kind of wary realism.
I think that’s kind of the conundrum of climate activists on the whole,
but is it something you have thoughts about? Do you want readers to come
away hopeful, or are you hoping this galvanizes action, too?</strong>
</p>
<p>
That duality, that tension, is deeply rooted in me, and perhaps many
people who care about climate and environment. I study the Earth for a
living; I see the changes happening not just year to year but decade to
decade from now. And you can’t help but be discouraged about the lack of
progress.
</p>
<p>
But on the other hand, I talk to students about how optimism and hope
are muscles we can exercise. My first homework assignment in every class
is for students to find things that are better today than they were 50
or 100 years ago. That list is long: life expectancy and childhood
mortality; water and air quality; the decline of global poverty despite
all the injustices that remain. Then there are many specific examples,
like the phase-out of leaded gasoline, the Montreal Protocol, and my
favorite example, the U.S. Clean Air Act, which saves hundreds of
thousands of lives a year at a 30-fold return on investment, so workers
are healthier and more productive. We all breathe easier and pay lower
medical expenses from air pollution. So I talk to students about how
it’s important to acknowledge past successes; by doing so, we make
future successes, such as climate, more likely.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Are there any last thoughts about your book that you want to
leave readers with?</strong>
</p>
<p>
In the book, I tend to emphasize technologies — maybe to a fault. We
don’t talk enough about reducing consumption and demand. The world is
deeply unequal in terms of resource use and pollution.
</p>
<p>
I’m obviously a nerdy guy, and I talk about how we’re in the “myocene” —
the <em><em>my</em></em>-ocene — the era when the top 1% of the world’s
population contributes more fossil carbon emissions than half the people
on Earth. The world cannot support the global population at the levels
of resource use that we have in the United States right now. Either we
need to reduce our energy use and consumption somewhat, or those other
people in those other countries will aspire to be like us and they’ll
produce and use more.
</p>
<p>
One example is cars: if everyone in the world owned cars at the rate we
do, there would be 7 billion cars instead of about 1.5 billion. And I
don’t care whether those cars are EVs or hydrogen vehicles or whatever;
the world would not be a more sustainable and richer place with 5
billion more cars on it. We need to talk about using less in this
country, not just building new things.
