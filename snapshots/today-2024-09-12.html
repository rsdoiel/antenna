published in <em>The Lancet Planetary Health</em>, warning that human
activity is damaging the natural systems that support life on Earth.
Almost all of these support systems – including the climate, soil
nutrient cycles, and freshwater – have been pushed into danger zones as
humans strive for ever more economic growth. Thus, the researchers say,
the health of the planet and its people are at risk, and the poor are
the most vulnerable. The study concludes “fundamental system-wide
transformations are needed” to address overconsumption, overhaul
economic systems, improve technologies, and transform governance.

a 34-year-old man suspected of starting a wildfire in California that
has now burned more than 36,000 acres and is less than 20% contained.
The Line fire is one of several large blazes burning in the state and
threatening thousands of structures. Last month another man was charged
with arson on suspicion of igniting the Park fire, which consumed
430,000 acres in Northern California. As Heatmap’s Jeva Lange
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/park-fire-arson?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_fkww6CkDrFW0D91uIi0RMEFOn9mSA6Vn6AXgQumqcqmYeAnarnXQB_v6C52B7G15VoFXs" rel="noopener" target="_self">reported</a>,
arson officially accounts for only about 10% of fires handled by Cal
Fire. But when there are thousands of fires across the state during a
given season, that’s not an inconsequential number. And a warmer world
has made extreme fire conditions more common, as have decades of
misbegotten fire suppression policies in the Western United States. As a
result, arson fires in rural areas are more likely to burn out of
control than they would have been half a century ago, Lange wrote.

to finish the paving of a controversial road through the Amazon
rainforest. The BR-319 highway would connect some major cities and

also hasten deforestation, including in old growth forests. “Without the

section of BR-319, without ensuring environmental governance and the

deforestation, as pointed out by many specialists and by Brazil’s
federal environmental agency in the licensing process.” Lula made the
pledge during a visit to assess the damage from massive fires in the
rainforest, which his Environment Minister Marina Silva blamed on
extreme drought caused by climate change.

<li>Survey sheds light on EV drivers’ charging preferences

A new survey of more than 1,000 EV owners in California has some
interesting insights into what these drivers want from a charging
station. It found they were 37% more likely to choose a charger with
additional amenities like restrooms and convenience stores. “This
symbiotic relationship between businesses and EV chargers may benefit
both EV chargers and local businesses,”

Also, California’s EV drivers <em><em>really</em></em> don’t want to

miles of charge if there’s no wait time at the charger. With every

hope cooler weather will aid battle against 3 major Southern California
fires</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Wrightwood, California — Firefighters battling three major wildfires
in the mountains east of Los Angeles took advantage of cooler weather
Wednesday as they slowly gained the upper hand, but not before dozens of
homes were destroyed and thousands of people were forced to
evacuate.</p>
<p>California is only now heading into the teeth of the wildfire season
but already has seen nearly three times as much acreage burn than during
all of 2023. The wildfires have threatened tens of thousands of homes
and other structures across Southern California since they accelerated
during a triple-digit heat wave over the weekend.</p>
<p>No deaths have been reported, but at least a dozen people, mainly
firefighters, have been treated for injuries, mostly heat-related,
authorities said.</p>
<p>In the small community of Wrightwood, about 90 minutes outside Los
Angeles, authorities implored residents to flee the exploding Bridge
Fire, which has burned more than a dozen homes in the area.</p>
<p>Resident Erin Arias said she was racing up the mountain when she got
the order to leave and did, grabbing her passport and dog. On Wednesday,
she and her husband doused water on the roof of their still-standing
home. Their cat was missing, she said.</p>
<p>“It’s absolutely scary,” Arias said, looking at the burned embers of
her neighbor’s home. “We’re really lucky.”</p>
<p>UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain said the fire moved
extraordinarily fast across complex terrain, likely giving residents
less time to evacuate than usual and surprising even seasoned fire
officials.</p>
<p>The Bridge Fire “had to go up mountain sides, burn down slope, jump
across valleys, burn across new ridges, and then make it down slope
again at least two other times in effectively one burning period,” he
said.</p>
<p>The full extent of the damage caused by the fires remained unclear.
The three blazes are:</p>
<p>— The Airport Fire in Orange County, which has burned more than 91
square kilometers. The fire was 5% contained Wednesday night and was
reportedly sparked by heavy equipment operating in the area. Orange
County Fire Capt. Steve Concialdi said eight firefighters have been
treated for injuries, mostly heat-related. One resident suffered smoke
inhalation and another burns, he said. Several homes burned in El Cariso
Village.</p>
<p>— The Line Fire in the San Bernardino National Forest, which was 18%
contained Wednesday and had charred 148 square kilometers. The blaze has
injured three firefighters. Authorities said it was caused by arson in
Highland. A suspect was arrested Tuesday.</p>
<p>— The Bridge Fire east of Los Angeles, which grew tenfold in a day
and has burned 202 square kilometers, torched at least 33 homes and six
cabins and forced the evacuation of 10,000 people. The cause of the fire
is not yet known. It remained zero percent contained Wednesday
night.</p>
<p>Gov. Gavin Newsom sent National Guard troops in to help with
evacuations, and the White House said President Joe Biden was monitoring
the situation.</p>
<p>In El Cariso Village, a community of 250 people along Highway 74 in
Riverside County, an Associated Press photographer saw at least 10 homes
and several cars engulfed in flames.</p>
<p>Orange County Fire Authority Incident Commander Kevin Fetterman said
the blaze has been difficult to tame because of the terrain and dry
conditions and because some areas hadn’t burned in decades.</p>
<p>More than 5,500 homes in Riverside County were under evacuation
orders, affecting more than 19,000 residents. Several recreational
cabins and structures in the Cleveland National Forest have been
damaged.</p>
<p>In San Bernardino County, some 65,600 homes and buildings were under
threat by the Line Fire, and residents along the southern edge of Big
Bear Lake were told to leave Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Line Fire blanketed the area with a thick cloud of dark smoke,
which provided shade for firefighters trying to get ahead of winds
expected later Wednesday, said Fabian Herrera, a spokesperson for those
battling the Line Fire.</p>
<p>A man from the town of Norco suspected of starting the Line Fire on
Sept. 5 was arrested and charged with arson, San Bernardino County
Sheriff’s Department said. Officials did not specify what was used to
start the fire.</p>
<p>Investigators collected evidence from the man’s vehicle and home that
suggests he could have been involved in starting other fires, San
Bernardino County Sheriff Shannon Dicus said Wednesday.</p>
<p>On the Nevada border with California near Reno, the Davis Fire forced
thousands of people to evacuate over the weekend, destroyed one home and
a dozen structures and charred nearly 23 square kilometers of timber and
brush along the Sierra Nevada’s eastern front.</p>
<p>Rich Meyr and Evelyn Kelley were the first arrivals at an evacuation
center set up Wednesday at a recreation center in south Reno. Both said
they refused to evacuate previous fires but decided to play it safe this
time.</p>
<p>“My son’s wedding is Saturday. I threw all the flowers and gowns in
the RV and we left. It looks like a garden shop inside that RV,” Kelley
said. “But who wants to burn alive?”</p>
<p>More than 600 firefighters kept the blaze from growing Wednesday
despite high winds that grounded all aircraft that had dropped retardant
on the flames over the past two days. The fire was about 30% contained
Wednesday night.</p>

weakens moving inland from Gulf Coast after hurricane winds cause power
outages</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MORGAN CITY, La. — Francine weakened Thursday after striking
Louisiana as a Category 2 hurricane that knocked out power to hundreds
of thousands of homes and businesses, sent storm surge rushing into
coastal communities and raised flood fears in New Orleans and beyond as
drenching rains spread over the northern Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>The tropical storm was forecast to be downgraded to a tropical
depression as it churned northward over Mississippi, the National
Hurricane Center said. Some 3 to 6 inches (8 to 15 centimeters) of rain
were possible in parts of Mississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee, Alabama,
Georgia and the Florida Panhandle, with up to 10 inches (25 centimeters)
possible in some spots in parts of Alabama and Florida, forecasters
said, warning of the potential threat of scattered flash flooding as
farflung as Jackson, Mississippi; Birmingham, Alabama; Memphis,
Tennessee; and Atlanta.</p>
<p>Francine slammed the Louisiana coast Wednesday evening with 100 mph
(155 kph) winds in coastal Terrebonne Parish, battering a fragile
coastal region that hasn’t fully recovered from a series of devastating
hurricanes in 2020 and 2021. It then moved at a fast clip toward New
Orleans, pounding the city with torrential rains.</p>
<p>There were no immediate reports of deaths or injuries. TV news
broadcasts from coastal communities showed waves from nearby lakes,
rivers and Gulf waters thrashing sea walls. Water poured into city
streets amid blinding downpours. Oak and cypress trees leaned in the
high winds, and some utility poles swayed back and forth.</p>
<p>“It’s a little bit worse than what I expected to be honest with you,”
said Alvin Cockerham, fire chief of Morgan City about 30 miles (50
kilometers) from where the storm’s center made landfall. “I pulled all
my trucks back to the station. It’s too dangerous to be out there in
this.”</p>
<p>Power outages in Louisiana topped 390,000 early Thursday in
Louisiana, according to the tracking site poweroutage.us, with an
additional 46,000 outages reported in Mississippi.</p>
<p>Sheltering at her mother’s home just outside Morgan City, Laura
Leftwich said blasts of wind had swept away two large birdhouses
outside. She had a generator powering an internet connection so she
could video chat with friends, holding her computer to a window to show
them water overflowing in the street.</p>
<p>If the storm had been any more intense, “I wouldn’t have the guts to
look outside,” said Leftwich, 40. “It’s a little scary.”</p>
<p>The sixth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, Francine drew
fuel from exceedingly warm Gulf of Mexico waters, strengthening to a
Category 2 storm before landfall. It weakened late Wednesday to a
tropical storm.</p>
<p>In addition to torrential rains, there was a lingering threat of
spin-off tornadoes from the storm Thursday in Florida and Alabama.</p>
<p>Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said the National Guard would fan out to
parishes impacted by Francine. They have food, water, nearly 400
high-water vehicles, about 100 boats and 50 helicopters to respond to
the storm, including for possible search-and-rescue operations.</p>
<p>Since the mid-19th century, some 57 hurricanes have tracked over or
made landfall in Louisiana, according to The Weather Channel. Among them
are some of the strongest, costliest and deadliest storms in U.S.
history.</p>
<p>Morgan City, home to around 11,500 people, sits on the banks of the
Atchafalaya River in south Louisiana and is surrounded by lakes and
marsh. It’s described on the city’s website as “gateway to the Gulf of
Mexico for the shrimping and oilfield industries.”</p>
<p>President Joe Biden granted an emergency declaration to help
Louisiana secure expedited federal money and assistance. Landry and
Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves also declared states of emergency.</p>
<p>The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said it distributed more
than 100,000 sandbags to the southern part of the state and the
Department of Education reported a number of school district closures
for Wednesday and Thursday.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
The rapid increase in demand for artificial intelligence is creating a
seemingly vexing national dilemma: How can we meet the vast energy
demands of a breakthrough industry without compromising our energy
goals?
</p>
<p>
If that challenge sounds familiar, that’s because it is. The U.S. has a
long history of rising to the electricity demands of innovative new
industries. Our energy needs grew
<a href="https://rhg.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Taking-Stock-2024_US-Energy-and-Emissions-Outlook.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>far
more quickly</u></a> in the four decades following World War II than
what we are facing today. More recently, we have squared off against the
energy requirements of new clean technologies that require significant
energy to produce —

notably hydrogen</a>.

</p>
<p>
The lesson we have learned time and again is that it is possible to
scale technological innovation in a way that also scales energy
innovation. Rather than accepting a zero-sum trade-off between
innovation and our clean energy goals, we should focus on policies that
leverage the growth of AI to scale the growth of clean energy.
</p>
<p>
At the core of this approach is the concept of additionality: Companies
operating massive data centers — often referred to as “hyperscalers” —
as well as utilities should have incentives to bring online new,
additional clean energy to power new computing needs. That way, we
leverage demand in one sector to scale up another. We drive innovation
in key sectors that are critical to our nation’s competitiveness, we
reward market leaders who are already moving in this direction with a
stable, long-term regulatory framework for growth, and we stay on track
to meet our nation’s climate commitments.
</p>
<p>
All of this is possible, but only if we take bold action now.
</p>
<p>
AI technologies have the potential to significantly boost America’s
economic productivity and enhance our national security. AI also has the
potential to accelerate the energy transition itself, from optimizing
the electricity grid, to improving weather forecasting, to accelerating
the discovery of chemicals and material breakthroughs that reduce
reliance on fossil fuels. Powering AI, however, is itself incredibly
energy intensive. Projections suggest that data centers could consume
<a href="https://www.epri.com/about/media-resources/press-release/q5vU86fr8TKxATfX8IHf1U48Vw4r1DZF" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>9%
of U.S. electricity generation</u></a> by 2030, up from 4% today.
Without a national policy response, this surge in energy demand risks
increasing our long-term reliance on fossil fuels. By some estimates,
around
<a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/pdfs/insights/pages/generational-growth-ai-data-centers-and-the-coming-us-power-surge/report.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>20
gigawatts</u></a> of additional natural gas generating capacity will
come online by 2030, and coal plant retirements are already being
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ddaac44b-e245-4c8a-bf68-c773cc8f4e63" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>delayed</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Avoiding this outcome will require creative focus on additionality.
Hydrogen represents a particularly relevant case study here. It, too, is
energy-intensive to produce — a single kilogram of hydrogen
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360319923018189" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>requires</u></a>
double the average household’s
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&t=3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>electricity</u></a>
consumption. And while hydrogen holds great promise to decarbonize parts
of our economy, hydrogen is not <em><em>per se </em></em>good for our
clean energy goals. Indeed, today’s fossil fuel-driven methods of
<a href="https://www.iea.org/energy-system/low-emission-fuels/hydrogen" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hydrogen</a>
production generate more emissions than the entire
<a href="https://www.iea.org/energy-system/transport/aviation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>aviation</u></a>
sector. While we can make zero-emissions hydrogen by using clean
electricity to split hydrogen from water, the source of that electricity
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/green-hydrogen-tax-credit-treasury" target="_self"><u>matters
a lot</u></a>. Similar to data centers, if the power for hydrogen
production comes from the existing electricity grid, then ramping up
electrolytic production of hydrogen could significantly <em><em>increase
</em></em>emissions by growing overall energy demand without cleaning
the energy mix.
</p>
<p>
This challenge led to the development of an
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/hydrogen-rule-biden-clean-energy" target="_self"><u>“additionality”
framework</u></a> for hydrogen. The Inflation Reduction Act offers
generous subsidies to hydrogen producers, but to qualify, they must
match their electricity consumption with additional (read: newly built)
clean energy generation close enough to them that they can actually use
it.
</p>
<p>
This approach, which is being refined in proposed guidance from the U.S.
Treasury Department, is designed to make sure that hydrogen’s energy
demand becomes a catalyst for investment in new clean electricity
generation and decarbonization technologies. Industry leaders are
already responding,
<a href="https://hystorenergy.com/hydrogen-industry-support-of-strong-45v-rules/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>stating</u></a>
their readiness to build over 50 gigawatts of clean electrolyzer
projects because of the long term certainty this framework provides.
</p>
<p>
While the scale and technology requirements are different, meeting AI’s
energy needs presents a similar challenge. Powering data centers from
the existing electricity grid mix means that more demand will create
more emissions; even when data centers are drawing on clean electricity,
if that energy is being
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/nuclear/data-centers-want-to-tap-existing-nuclear-power-is-that-good-or-bad" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>diverted</u></a>
from existing sources rather than coming from new,
<em><em>additional</em></em> clean electricity supply, the result is the
same. Amazon’s recent $650 million investment in a data center campus
next to an existing nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania illustrates the
challenge: While diverting those clean electrons from Pennsylvania homes
and businesses to the data center reduces Amazon’s reported emissions,
by increasing demand on the grid without building additional clean
capacity, it creates a need for new capacity in the region that will
likely be met by fossil fuels (while also shifting up to
<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/aep-exelon-pjm-interconnection-amazon-data-center-talen-ferc-isa/719869/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$140
million of additional costs</u></a> per year onto local customers).
</p>
<p>
Neither hyperscalers nor utilities should be expected to resolve this
complex tension on their own. As with hydrogen, it is in our national
interest to find a path forward.
</p>
<p>
What we need, then, is a national solution to make sure that as we
expand our AI capabilities, we bring online new clean energy, as well,
strengthening our competitive position in both industries and
forestalling the economic and ecological consequences of higher
electricity prices and higher carbon emissions.
</p>
<p>
In short, we should adopt a National AI Additionality Framework.
</p>
<p>
Under this framework, for any significant data center project, companies
would need to show how they are securing new, additional clean power
from a zero-emissions generation source. They could do this either by
building new “behind-the-meter” clean energy to power their operations
directly, or by partnering with a utility to pay a specified rate to
secure new grid-connected clean energy coming online.
</p>
<p>
If companies are unwilling or unable to secure dedicated additional
clean energy capacity, they would pay a fee into a clean deployment fund
at the Department of Energy that would go toward high-value investments
to expand clean electricity capacity. These could range from research
and deployment incentives for so-called “clean firm electricity
generation technologies like nuclear and geothermal, to investments in
transmission capacity in highly congested areas, to expanding
manufacturing capacity for supply-constrained electrical grid equipment
like transformers, to cleaning up rural electric cooperatives that serve
areas attractive to data centers. Given the variance in grid and
transmission issues, the fund would explicitly approach its investment
with a regional lens.
</p>
<p>
Several states operate similar systems: Under Massachusetts’ Renewable
Portfolio Standard, utilities are
<a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/frequently-asked-questions-massdep-clean-energy-standard/download" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>required</u></a>
to provide a certain percentage of electricity they serve from clean
energy facilities or pay an “alternative compliance payment” for every
megawatt-hour they are short of their obligation. Dollars collected from
these payments go toward the development and expansion of clean energy
projects and infrastructure in the state. Facing increasing capacity
constraints on the PJM grid, Pennsylvania legislators are now
<a href="https://www.senatorgeneyaw.com/2024/08/28/yaw-to-unveil-plans-for-pennsylvania-baseload-energy-development-fund/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>exploring</u></a>
a state Baseload Energy Development Fund to provide low-interest grants
and loans for new electricity generation facilities.
</p>
<p>
A national additionality framework should not only challenge the
industry to scale innovation in a way that scales clean technology, it
must also clear pathways to build clean energy at scale. We should
establish a dedicated fast-track approval process to move these clean
energy projects through federal, state, and local permitting and siting
on an accelerated basis. This will help companies already investing in
additional clean energy to move faster and more effectively – and make
it more difficult for anyone to hide behind the excuse that building new
clean energy capacity is too hard or too slow. Likewise, under this
framework, utilities that stand in the way of progress should be held
accountable and incentivized to adopt innovative new technologies and
business models that enable them to move at historic speed.
</p>
<p>
For hyperscalers committed to net-zero goals, this national approach
provides both an opportunity and a level playing field — an opportunity
to deliver on those commitments in a genuine way, and a reliable
long-term framework that will reward their investments to make that
happen. This approach would also build public trust in corporate climate
accountability and diminish the risk that those building data centers in
the U.S. stand accused of greenwashing or shifting the cost of
development onto ratepayers and communities. The policy clarity of an
additionality requirement can also encourage cutting edge artificial
intelligence technology to be built here in the United States. Moreover,
it is a model that can be extended to address other sectors facing
growing energy demand.
</p>
<p>
The good news is that many industry players are already moving in this
direction. A new agreement between Google and a Nevada utility, for
example, would allow Google to pay a higher rate for 24/7 clean
electricity from a new geothermal project. In the Carolinas, Duke Energy
announced its intent to explore a new clean tariff to support
carbon-free energy generation for large customers like Google and
Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
A national framework that builds on this progress is critical, though it
will not be easy; it will require quick Congressional action, executive
leadership, and new models of state and local partnership. But we have a
unique opportunity to build a strange bedfellow coalition to get it done
– across big tech, climate tech, environmentalists, permitting reform
advocates, and those invested in America’s national security and
technology leadership. Together, this framework can turn a vexing
trade-off into an opportunity. We can ensure that the hundreds of
billions of dollars invested in building an industry of the future
actually accelerates the energy transition, all while strengthening the
U.S.’s position in innovating cutting- edge AI and clean energy
technology.

US firm partner to conduct border pathogen monitoring</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Gaborone, Botswana — Botswana and an American biotech firm, Ginkgo
Bioworks, have partnered to conduct pathogen surveillance at the
country’s entry points. Health officials say the proactive move is meant
to safeguard public health as the world faces emerging disease
threats.</p>
<p>Botswana introduced mpox screening last month for travelers at its
entry points.</p>
<p>In a statement Wednesday, Ministry of Health spokesperson Christopher
Nyanga said a pathogen-monitoring program is critical to detecting
similar emerging health threats.</p>
<p>Dr. Mbatshi Mazwiduma, a public health expert, said the
pathogen-surveillance program will complement existing strategies to
prevent disease threats.</p>
<p>“The initiative by the Ministry of Health is a very welcome
development in the sense that it is at least demonstrating that they are
both embracing traditional methods of surveillance and disease detection
plus at the same time, they are looking at other innovative ways of
disease detection,” he said.</p>
<p>Through the collaboration, Boston-based Gingko Bioworks will work
with the Ministry of Health to collect and monitor travelers’ samples.
Nasal swabs will be used to collect the samples.</p>
<p>Nyanga said testing will be done on a voluntary, anonymous basis.</p>
<p>“Although participation in this initiative is entirely voluntary,
travelers are encouraged to participate because this early detection of
pathogens is meant to safeguard the health of all citizens, visitors and
residents of this country,” he said. “The samples collected will be kept
anonymous. The data collected from the samples will be vital in
strengthening the country’s robust health system and response to public
health threats and emergencies.”</p>
<p>But Mazwiduma said voluntary participation in the pathogen-monitoring
program could hinder effective disease detection.</p>
<p>“Perhaps if non-invasive, non-intrusive, the technique should be
compulsory because it ensures that the number of people who comply to
sample acquisition is increased and, therefore, you can actually rapidly
achieve suitable sample sizes for you to be able to ensure that you do
not miss any patients, but also more importantly that it allows you to
improve your validation of these particular technologies,” Mazwiduma
said.</p>
<p>Botswana and Gingko Bioworks previously collaborated in a 2022
pathogen-monitoring program to detect new and emerging COVID-19
variants.</p>
<p>During the same year, Botswana was credited with the discovery of
COVID-19 variant omicron.</p>

supports two permanent UN Security Council seats for Africa</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>UNITED NATIONS — The United States supports creating two permanent
United Nations Security Council seats for African states and one seat to
be rotated among small island developing states, U.S. Ambassador to the
U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield will announce on Thursday.</p>
<p>The move comes as the U.S. seeks to repair ties with Africa, where
many are unhappy about Washington’s support for Israel’s war in Gaza,
and deepen relations with Pacific Islands nations important to
countering Chinese influence in the region.</p>
<p>Thomas-Greenfield told Reuters she hopes the announcement will “move
this agenda forward in a way that we can achieve Security Council reform
at some point in the future,” describing it as part of U.S. President
Joe Biden’s legacy.</p>
<p>The push for two permanent African seats and a rotating seat for
small island developing states is in addition to Washington’s long-held
support for India, Japan and Germany to also get permanent seats on the
council.</p>
<p>Developing nations have long demanded permanent seats on the Security
Council, the most powerful body in the United Nations. But years of
talks on reform have proved fruitless and it is unclear whether U.S.
support could fuel action.</p>
<p>Ahead of making the announcement at the Council on Foreign Relations
in New York on Thursday, Thomas-Greenfield clarified to Reuters that
Washington does not support expanding veto power beyond the five
countries that hold it.</p>
<p>The Security Council is charged with maintaining international peace
and security and has the power to impose sanctions and arms embargos and
authorize the use of force.</p>
<p>When the U.N. was founded in 1945, the Security Council had 11
members. This increased in 1965 to 15 members, made up of 10 elected
states serving two-year terms and five permanent veto-wielding nations:
Russia, China, France, the U.S. and Britain.</p>
<p>Legitimacy problem</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres backs Security Council
reform.</p>
<p>“You have a Security Council that corresponds exactly to the
situation after the Second World War … that has a problem of legitimacy,
and that has a problem of effectiveness, and it needs to be reformed,”
Guterres told Reuters on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Any change to the Security Council membership is done by amending the
founding U.N. Charter. This needs the approval and ratification by
two-thirds of the General Assembly, including the Security Council’s
current five veto powers.</p>
<p>The 193-member U.N. General Assembly has annually discussed reform of
the Security Council for more than a decade. But momentum has grown in
recent years as geopolitical rivalries have deadlocked the council on
several issues, particularly after permanent veto-wielding member Russia
invaded Ukraine.</p>
<p>“Much of the conversation around Security Council reform has been
just that: a conversation,” Thomas-Greenfield will say on Thursday,
according to prepared remarks reviewed by Reuters of her announcement
that Washington supports moving to negotiations on a draft text to amend
the U.N. Charter to expand the council.</p>
<p>Thomas-Greenfield told Reuters she could not say how long it might
take to get the General Assembly to vote on such a resolution.</p>
<p>Each year the General Assembly elects five new members from different
geographical groups for two-year terms on the Security Council. Africa
currently has three seats rotated among states.</p>
<p>“The problem is, these non-permanent seats don’t enable African
countries to deliver the full benefit of their knowledge and voices to
the work of the council … to consistently lead on the challenges that
affect all of us - and disproportionately affect Africans,”
Thomas-Greenfield will say.</p>
<p>She will also say that small island developing states deserve a
rotating elected seat because they offer “critical insights on a range
of international peace and security issues: including, notably, the
impact of climate change.”</p>

id="us-grants-egypt-1.3-billion-in-military-aid-overriding-rights-conditions">US
grants Egypt $1.3 billion in military aid, overriding rights
conditions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The Biden administration is overriding human rights
conditions on military aid to Egypt, a State Department spokesperson
said on Wednesday, granting the U.S. ally its full allocation of $1.3
billion this year for the first time during this administration, despite
ongoing concerns over human rights in the country.</p>
<p>The announcement comes as Washington has relied heavily on Cairo, a
longstanding U.S. ally, to mediate so far unsuccessful talks between
Israel and Hamas on a cease-fire deal to end the war in Gaza.</p>
<p>Of the $1.3 billion in U.S. foreign military financing allocated to
Egypt, $320 million is subject to conditions that have meant at least
some of that sum has been withheld in recent years.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Congress on Wednesday that he
would waive a certification requirement on $225 million related to
Egypt’s human rights record this year, citing “the U.S. national
security interest,” the spokesperson said by email.</p>
<p>“This decision is important to advancing regional peace and Egypt’s
specific and ongoing contributions to U.S. national security priorities,
particularly to finalize a cease-fire agreement for Gaza, bring the
hostages home, surge humanitarian assistance for Palestinians in need,
and help bring an enduring end to the Israel-Hamas conflict,” the
spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Democrat Chris Murphy, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee’s Middle East subcommittee, said Washington had previously
withheld military aid from Egypt on human rights grounds while
maintaining its strategic relationship with the country.</p>
<p>“It’s no secret that Egypt remains a deeply repressive autocratic
state, and I see no good reason to ignore that fact by waiving these
requirements,” Murphy said.</p>
<p>Cairo has remained a close regional ally of Washington despite
accusations of widespread abuses under President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi’s
government, including torture and enforced disappearances.</p>
<p>Sissi denies there are political prisoners in Egypt. He says
stability and security are paramount and authorities are promoting
rights by trying to provide basic needs such as jobs and housing.</p>
<p>The war in Gaza, sparked by the October 7 attacks by Palestinian
militants on southern Israel, has increased Washington’s reliance on
Cairo for diplomatic efforts like the cease-fire talks. Much-needed
humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza also enters from Egypt.</p>
<p>Blinken issued a similar waiver on the human rights conditions last
year but withheld a portion of the military aid over Egypt’s failure to
make “clear and consistent progress” on the release of political
prisoners.</p>
<p>This year, he determined that Egypt had made sufficient efforts on
political prisoners to release $95 million tied to progress on the
issue, the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>They cited Egypt’s efforts to draft legislation to reform pretrial
detention and the broader penal code, its release of some political
prisoners and a move to end travel bans and asset freezes associated
with foreign funding for nongovernmental organizations.</p>
<p>Seth Binder, director of advocacy for the Washington-based Middle
East Democracy Center, said that while about 970 prisoners had been
released since last September, at least 2,278 Egyptians were arbitrarily
arrested over the same period, according to data collected by the center
and Egyptian human rights groups.</p>
<p>The State Department spokesperson said Washington was continuing “a
rigorous dialogue with the Egyptian government on the importance of
concrete human rights improvements that are crucial to sustaining the
strongest possible U.S.-Egypt partnership.”</p>

case faces uncertainty again as US appellate court arguments loom</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The future of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals
(DACA) program remains in limbo with another court hearing set for
October 10.</p>
<p>Judges from the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hear arguments
on the case, initiated in 2018 by Texas and other Republican-led states
seeking to end DACA. The program offers temporary protection from
deportation and work permits to undocumented immigrants brought to the
U.S. as children who are often referred to as “Dreamers.”</p>
<p>The case centers on whether DACA exceeds presidential authority,
immigration advocates from the coalition “Home is Here” said during a
recent conversation with reporters.</p>
<p>“Our response to that is that presidential authority in the area of
immigration, and particularly the discretion exercised by the executive
branch, is very broad and certainly encompasses the type of program that
DACA is, which is now a regulation,” Nina Perales, vice president of
litigation at the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund,
said during the call.</p>
<p>A central issue in the case is whether Texas and other states have
the standing to sue.</p>
<p>Texas and other Republican-led states have argued that DACA has
harmed them financially because they are spending resources on
education, health care and other services on undocumented immigrants who
were allowed to remain in the country illegally.</p>
<p>But Perales, who will be one of the attorneys arguing the case in
October, said that “Texas cannot show any injury as a result of DACA”
because recipients contribute to their communities and states by paying
taxes and more.</p>
<p>A final decision could take a while, said Perales, who noted the 5th
Circuit could take “as long as 18 months” to rule.</p>
<p>And the case could end in several ways: The 5th Circuit might dismiss
the case, send it back to the lower court or rule against DACA, which
could then be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>“One possible scenario is that the 5th Circuit decides [U.S.
District] Judge [Andrew] Hanen didn’t evaluate the evidence properly and
sends the case back to [him],” she said.</p>
<p>If that happens, Perales said, DACA recipients might benefit from the
current case’s legal state, which allows recipients to continue renewing
their DACA benefits while awaiting the courts’ final resolution. The
Biden administration continues to accept new applications but does not
process them.</p>
<p>How we got here</p>
<p>Former President Barack Obama, frustrated with congressional inaction
on the Dream Act, created DACA by executive order in 2012. Some DACA
recipients arrived legally, but their families later overstayed their
visas; others arrived by crossing the U.S.-Mexico border without
authorization. They are now in their mid-20s to late 30s, and they come
from around the world.</p>
<p>In 2018, Texas and other Republican-led states sued the federal
government, arguing not only that they were being harmed financially but
also that only Congress has the authority to grant immigration
benefits.</p>
<p>In 2022, the Biden administration revised the program in hopes of
satisfying one of the arguments made in federal courts by Republican-led
states — that the program was not created properly. Biden officials
issued the new version of DACA in late August. It went through a period
of public comments as part of a formal rule-making process to increase
its odds of surviving this legal battle.</p>
<p>In a February 2023 statement, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a
Republican, wrote in a statement on his website that “the Obama and
Biden programs are practically indistinguishable in both the negative
harms that they will have on this country and in the illegal means used
to implement them. I am therefore calling for the new DACA rule to end
in the same way that the Obama-era rule did: struck down as
unlawful.”</p>
<p>But DACA has support. In October 2022, a coalition of dozens of
influential corporations, including Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft,
sent a letter to Republicans and Democrats in Congress urging a
bipartisan solution for the almost 600,000 immigrants who are enrolled
in DACA.</p>
<p>According to the Migration Policy Institute, DACA has “improved
recipients’ employment outcomes, increased the labor force participation
rates of those who are eligible, decreased their unemployment rates, and
boosted earnings for those with the lowest incomes.”</p>
<p>MPI’s analysis shows that DACA holders contribute “nearly $42 billion
to the U.S. gross domestic product each year and add $3.4 billion to the
federal balance sheet.”</p>
<p>Bruna Bouhid-Sollod, a former DACA recipient and current senior
political director at United We Dream, highlighted the emotional impact
of the uncertainty.</p>
<p>“The importance of making [the impact] really clear is really
important. … DACA recipients and their families are dealing with an
extreme amount of stress,” she said.</p>
<p>With renewal periods lasting just two years, many recipients are in
constant limbo, unsure if their work permits and deportation protections
will remain intact.</p>
<p>There is a lot at stake, according to immigration lawyers and
advocates.</p>
<p>“Unless you’re living in it … you don’t think about the impact it has
on the people that are waiting for their lives to be decided by this
case,” Bouhid-Sollod said.</p>

id="trump-falsely-accuses-immigrants-in-ohio-of-abducting-eating-pets">Trump
falsely accuses immigrants in Ohio of abducting, eating pets</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio — Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday amplified
false rumors that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were abducting and eating
pets, repeating during a televised debate the type of inflammatory and
anti-immigrant rhetoric he has promoted throughout his campaigns.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that Haitian immigrants in an Ohio community are
doing that, officials say. But during the debate with Vice President
Kamala Harris, Trump specifically mentioned Springfield, Ohio, the town
at the center of the claims, saying that immigrants were taking over the
city.</p>
<p>“They’re eating the dogs. They’re eating the cats. They’re eating the
pets of the people that live there,” he said.</p>
<p>Harris called Trump “extreme” and laughed after his comment. Debate
moderators pointed out that city officials have said the claims are not
true.</p>
<p>Trump’s comments echoed claims made by his campaign, including his
running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance, and other Republicans. The claims
attracted attention this week when Vance posted on social media that his
office has “received many inquiries” about Haitian migrants abducting
pets. Vance acknowledged Tuesday it was possible “all of these rumors
will turn out to be false.”</p>
<p>Officials have said there have been no credible or detailed reports
about the claims, even as Trump and his allies use them to amplify
racist stereotypes about Black and brown immigrants.</p>
<p>While president, Trump questioned why the U.S. would accept people
from “s—hole” countries such as Haiti and some in Africa. His 2024
campaign has focused heavily on illegal immigration, often referencing
in his speeches crimes committed by migrants. He argues immigrants are
responsible for driving up crime and drug abuse in the United States and
taking resources from American citizens.</p>
<p>Here’s a closer look at how the false claims have spread.</p>
<p>How did this get started?</p>
<p>On September 6, a post surfaced on X that shared what looked like a
screengrab of a social media post apparently out of Springfield. The
retweeted post talked about the person’s “neighbor’s daughter’s friend”
seeing a cat hanging from a tree to be butchered and eaten, claiming
without evidence that Haitians lived at the house. The accompanying
photo showed a Black man carrying what appeared to be a Canada goose by
its feet. That post continued to be shared on social media.</p>
<p>On Monday, Vance posted on X: “Reports now show that people have had
their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn’t be in this
country. Where is our border czar?” he said. The next day, Vance posted
again on X about Springfield, saying his office had received inquiries
from residents who said “their neighbors’ pets or local wildlife were
abducted by Haitian migrants. It’s possible, of course, that all of
these rumors will turn out to be false.”</p>
<p>Other Republicans shared similar posts. Among them was Texas Senator
Ted Cruz, who posted a photo of kittens with a caption that said to vote
for Trump “So Haitian immigrants don’t eat us.”</p>
<p>Hours before Trump’s debate with Harris, he posted two related photos
on his social media site. One Truth Social post was a photo of Trump
surrounded by cats and geese. Another featured armed cats wearing MAGA
hats.</p>
<p>A billboard campaign launched by the Republican Party of Arizona at
12 sites in metropolitan Phoenix plays off the false rumors. The
billboard image resembles a Chick-fil-A ad, portraying four kittens and
urging people to “Vote Republican!” and “Eat Less Kittens.”</p>
<p>Chick-fil-A said the party didn’t reach out to the restaurant chain
before running the ad, declining to comment further. In a statement, the
state party said the ad humorously underscores the need for border
security.</p>
<p>What do officials in Ohio say?</p>
<p>The office of the Springfield city manager, Bryan Heck, issued a
statement knocking down the rumors.</p>
<p>“In response to recent rumors alleging criminal activity by the
immigrant population in our city, we wish to clarify that there have
been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed,
injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community,” Heck’s
office said in an emailed statement.</p>
<p>Springfield police on Monday told the Springfield News-Sun that they
had received no reports of stolen or eaten pets.</p>
<p>Governor Mike DeWine held a news conference Tuesday to address the
influx of Haitian immigrants to Springfield. He said he will send state
troopers to Springfield to help local law enforcement deal with traffic
issues and is earmarking $2.5 million over two years to provide more
primary health care to immigrant families.</p>
<p>DeWine declined to address the allegations, deferring comment to
local officials. But he repeatedly spoke in support of the people of
Haiti, where his family has long operated a charity.</p>
<p>What do we know about a separate case 281 km away?</p>
<p>An entirely unrelated incident that occurred last month in Canton,
Ohio, quickly and erroneously conflated into the discussion.</p>
<p>On Aug. 26, Canton police charged a 27-year-old woman with animal
cruelty and disorderly conduct after she “did torture, kill, and eat a
cat in a residential area in front (of) multiple people,” according to a
police report.</p>
<p>But Allexis Ferrell is not Haitian. She was born in Ohio and
graduated from Canton’s McKinley High School in 2015, according to
public records and newspaper reports. Court records show she has been in
and out of trouble with the law since at least 2017. Messages seeking
comment were not returned by several attorneys who have represented
her.</p>
<p>She is being held in Stark County jail pending a competency hearing
next month, according to the prosecutor’s office.</p>
<p>What do advocates for Haitian immigrants say?</p>
<p>The posts create a false narrative and could be dangerous for
Haitians in the United States, according to Guerline Jozef, founder and
executive director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, a group that supports
and advocates for immigrants of African descent</p>
<p>“We are always at the receiving end of all kind of barbaric, inhumane
narratives and treatments, specifically when it comes to immigration,”
Jozef said in a phone interview.</p>
<p>Her comments echoed White House national security spokesman John
Kirby.</p>
<p>“There will be people that believe it, no matter how ludicrous and
stupid it is,” Kirby said. “And they might act on that kind of
information, and act on it in a way where somebody could get hurt. So it
needs to stop.”</p>
<p>What is the broader context of Haitians in Ohio and the United
States?</p>
<p>Springfield, a city of roughly 60,000, has seen its Haitian
population grow in recent years. It’s impossible to give an exact
number, according to the city, but it estimates Springfield’s entire
county has an overall immigrant population of 15,000.</p>
<p>The city also says that the Haitian immigrants are in the country
legally under a federal program that allows for them to remain in the
country temporarily. Last month the Biden administration granted
eligibility for temporary legal status to about 300,000 Haitians already
in the United States because conditions in Haiti are considered unsafe
for them to return. Haiti’s government has extended a state of emergency
to the entire country due to endemic gang violence.</p>

id="threats-in-indo-pacific-fuel-debate-over-us-nuclear-redeployment">Threats
in Indo-Pacific fuel debate over US nuclear redeployment</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Threats from China, Russia and North Korea have fueled
debate in Washington about whether the United States should consider
redeploying tactical nuclear weapons to the Indo-Pacific region, with
leading U.S. Senate members expressing opposing views.</p>
<p>Earlier in May, Republican Senator Roger Wicker, ranking member of
the Senate Armed Services Committee, put forward a military spending
plan that included the idea of redeploying U.S. tactical nuclear arms
that were withdrawn from South Korea more than three decades ago.</p>
<p>Another Republican, Senator James Risch, who is the ranking member of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told VOA Korean last month in an
email statement that the U.S. should “explore options for returning
nuclear weapons to the Pacific theater for the purpose of strengthening
extended deterrence.”</p>
<p>The term “extended deterrence” refers to the U.S. commitment to
respond in kind to a nuclear attack on South Korea.</p>
<p>Drawing a contrast, Democratic Senator Jack Reed, chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee, told reporters Monday in a phone
conference that he didn’t think that U.S. tactical nuclear weapons
should be redeployed to the Korean Peninsula, adding that it could
provoke a “major response from the Chinese.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Redeployment of nukes</p>
<p>The U.S. government has made it clear that the U.S. does not plan to
redeploy its tactical nuclear weapons to the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>“We believe that the only effective way to reduce nuclear threats on
the peninsula is by curbing the proliferation of nuclear weapons,” a
State Department spokesperson said in an emailed statement to VOA last
week.</p>
<p>In 1991, the U.S. withdrew from South Korea all of its nuclear
weapons, or about 100, according to some studies.</p>
<p>The U.S. has been closely watching the growing military cooperation
among China, Russia and North Korea, especially in the wake of Russia’s
invasion of Ukraine. It has identified the three nations as threats to
stability in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.</p>
<p>On August 22, the White House confirmed to VOA that a new “nuclear
employment guidance” had been issued. The terms of the classified
document are not public, but The New York Times quoted two senior
administration officials as saying that it “seeks to prepare the United
States for possible coordinated nuclear challenges from China, Russia
and North Korea.”</p>
<p>“The guidance issued earlier this year is not a response to any
single entity, country, nor threat,” White House National Security
Council spokesman Sean Savett said in an email to VOA. “We have
repeatedly voiced concerns about the advancing nuclear arsenals of
Russia, PRC [China] and the DPRK [North Korea].”</p>
<p>Vipin Narang, who recently served as the acting assistant secretary
of defense for space policy, said in an August forum held by the
Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies that the
United States may need to seek “a change in the size or posture” of
nuclear forces to deal with threats from China, Russia and North
Korea.</p>
<p>Growing threats</p>
<p>In South Korea, there is growing uneasiness about the U.S. capability
to protect South Korea from North Korea’s advancing nuclear and missile
weapons.</p>
<p>North Korea’s state Korean Central News Agency on Sunday released a
photo showing the country’s leader, Kim Jong Un, inspecting a new
12-axle transporter erector launcher (TEL), which could be used to
launch a new, longer missile to potentially attack the United States.
The next day, in a speech celebrating the country’s founding
anniversary, Kim vowed to increase the number of nuclear weapons
“exponentially.”</p>
<p>Amid these geopolitical tensions, U.S.-based experts appear to be
divided about whether the U.S. should redeploy tactical nuclear weapons
to the Korean Peninsula.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Richard Lawless, former deputy undersecretary of defense for Asian
and Pacific security, said the idea that South Korea would be
intimidated by China, Russia or South Korea from even beginning a
discussion on the subject with Washington “is failed logic.”</p>
<p>“Many Americans continue to fail to appreciate the threat of North
Korea and China, typically playing down the latter.”</p>
<p>Robert Peters, a research fellow for nuclear deterrence and missile
defense at the Heritage Foundation, told VOA Korean via email that he
supported the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to South Korea.</p>
<p>“I’m concerned about the credibility of our deterrent in the face of
North Korean nuclear expansion and Chinese nuclear breakout,” Peters
said, adding that stationing nonstrategic nuclear weapons within the
theater gives the U.S. president “far more optionality when crafting a
deterrence message during times of acute crisis or conflict than if he
or she could rely solely on strategic nuclear weapons.”</p>
<p>Opposing views</p>
<p>But Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at
the Heritage Foundation, said he was against redeploying U.S. tactical
nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>“Placing such high-value weapons in a static, fixed bunker makes a
very tempting preemptive target for North Korea,” Klingner told VOA
Korean on Tuesday via email. “During a crisis, it could even lower
deterrence by making Pyongyang more likely to initiate a preemptive
attack on the bunker prior to the weapons being deployed on mobile
launch platforms.”</p>
<p>Gary Samore, former White House coordinator for arms control and
weapons of mass destruction during the Obama administration, said he
didn’t support the redeployment of U.S. nuclear weapons to South Korea.
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“From a strictly military standpoint, the U.S. can enforce extended
deterrence with nuclear-armed submarines and long-range bombers that
North Korea cannot defend against,” Samore told VOA Korean on Tuesday
via email.</p>
<p>“Politically, redeployment of U.S. nuclear weapons in South Korea
would be controversial with some Korean political parties and the Korean
public and would increase tensions in the region, especially with China
and North Korea, and even between South Korea and Japan,” Samore
said.</p>
<p>Sydney Seiler, who until last year was the national intelligence
officer for North Korea on the U.S. National Intelligence Council, told
VOA Korean via email Tuesday that “there is a consensus among [U.S. and
South Korean] leaders and their senior national security advisers that
such a redeployment is unnecessary at this time.”   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in Washington told VOA in an email Tuesday that
the Chinese “firmly oppose any country’s attempt to use the Korean
Peninsula nuclear issue to harm China’s strategic security interests.”
 </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It is hoped that the U.S. can abandon the cold war mentality and
hegemonic logic, adopt a rational and responsible nuclear policy, stop
nuclear sharing, extended deterrence, expanding nuclear alliance, and
other negative moves, and play a constructive role in maintaining
regional and global peace and stability,” Chinese Embassy spokesperson
Liu Pengyu said Tuesday in a written statement via email, responding to
an inquiry from VOA Korean.</p>

<h2 id="android-applications-can-now-block-being-sideloaded">Android
applications can now block being sideloaded</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>It seems Google is hell-bent on removing anything from Android that
makes the platform stand apart from iOS. One of the features of Android
and the Play Store that users of rooted and/or de-Googled phones will be
familiar with is SafetyNet Attestation, something that Android
applications can use to check, among other things, if the device it’s
running on is rooted or not, and take any action from there based on
that information. Notoriously, some banking applications on Android will
refuse to work on rooted and/or de-Googled devices because of this.
Earlier this year, at Google I/O, the company unveiled the successor of
SafetyNet Attestation, called the Google Play Integrity API, and it
comes with a whole lot more functionality for developers to control what
their application can do on devices based on the status of the device
and the application binary in question. Play Integrity will let the
developer’s application know if its binary has been tampered with, if
Google Play Protect is enabled, if the Android device it’s running on is
“genuine”, and a whole lot more. Based on that information, the
application could decide to warn users when they’re about to do
something sensitive that their device is rooted, or it could just throw
up its hands entirely and refuse to function at all – and there’s really
not much the user can do about this. A new capability of the Play
Integrity API is that developers can now also determine where it came
from – i.e., if it was sideloaded or installed through a non-Play
application store – and then throw up a dialog allowing the user to
switch to the version from the Play Store instead. Doing so will delete
the original binary and all its data, and replace it with the Play Store
version. The problem here is that the only other option is to cancel,
and not have the application load at all. As you can see, the
remediation dialog tells you to “get this app from Play” in order to
continue using it. There’s an option to close the dialog, but there’s no
way to bypass it entirely. If you close the dialog, a response is sent
to the app that lets the developer know so they can decide whether to
continue blocking access. ↫ Mishaal Rahman at Android Authority Several
applications appear to already be using this new capability, and while
it won’t mean much for people running Google’s, Samsung’s, or any other
“blessed by Google” version of Android on unrooted devices, people
running, say, /e/OS, GrapheneOS, LineageOS, or any other de-Googled
and/or rooted device is going to be having a very bad time if more and
more applications adopt this capability. If you’re running a device
without Play Services, relying solely on the vast and varied library of
applications from F-Droid, for instance, while also sideloading a few
applications only available in the Play Store, you could very well be
running into problems. We’ll have to see just how widespread this
capability becomes, but I can already foresee this becoming yet another
major headache for anyone trying to use a smartphone that isn’t from
blessed by Apple or Google. Personally, I’m lucky in that Swedish
banking and ID applications worked on de-Googled Android phones, but
with the expanding reach of the Play Integrity API, as well as possible
“let’s enable this by default” shenanigans by Google, I’m definitely
worried about this remaining so in the future.</p>

smokes, I just released a MiniGolf game for Palm OS in 2024’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>This summer, I embarked on a side project to create a brand-new Palm
OS game, and after less than two months of intermittent coding, I’m
excited to announce that it’s ready to be released to the public! ↫
Captain’s Quarters The game in question is a top-down minigolf game, and
works on devices running Palm OS 3.5 and higher, in both monochrome and
colour, and there’s high-resolution support for devices running Palm OS
5.0 and higher. Sadly, my own Palm OS devices were all drained of
battery so I couldn’t quickly load it up and play it on real hardware in
time for this post (rest assured, my T|X is currently charging), but you
can play it in your browser if you want to. Like any other top-down
minigolf game, it’s simple and fun to play. The game’s creator, whose
real name I can’t find so I’ll just refer to them by their blog’s name
Captain’s Quarters, also wrote a published a post about the process of
developing a Palm OS game in 2024. Especially the section on what is
needed to code for Palm OS today is important if you’re also interested
in picking this up. The best news is that developing a Palm OS game can
be done on modern hardware, that saves me a lot of time not having to
deal with virtual machines or having to set up an old PC running Linux.
For getting a working compiler, I used prc-tools-remix, which is the
same old compiler as in the old days, but it’s updated to work on a
modern day Linux or OS X system. ↫ Captain’s Quarters People in general
are often oblivious to just how advanced and capable both Palm OS and
Windows PocketPC PDAs really were – most people never had one – and even
more people are oblivious to just how vibrant the gaming scene on Palm
OS was. My Palm OS devices were some of the best gaming handhelds I’ve
ever had, and my love for jewel-matching games still goes strong today
on Android, but it all started on Palm OS, the original mobile home of
the original Bejeweled. Palm OS games got me through quite a few boring
lectures and classes in university.</p>

<h2 id="us-pledges-support-for-africas-ai-goals">US pledges support for
Africa’s AI goals</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Abuja, Nigeria — The two-day pan-African AI conference co-hosted by
the United States concluded Wednesday in Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial
hub.</p>
<p>Hundreds of delegates including public officials, tech leaders,
policy makers academics and entrepreneurs attended the conference to
hold talks about the development and use of safe, secure and trustworthy
AI systems in Africa.</p>
<p>The U.S. deputy secretary of state, Kurt Campbell, spoke at the
summit about the opportunity at hand.</p>
<p>“A global technology revolution is well under way — the race to
develop and deploy new technologies, including artificial intelligence,
is already shaping everything about our lives,” said Campbell. “We aim
to foster collaborations between the United States and Africa AI
researchers, policy makers and industry leaders, so that we can work
together to drive innovation and address common challenges. This will
enable us to share the benefits of AI globally.”</p>
<p>The conference is a significant step in Africa’s technological
future.</p>
<p>Campbell said artificial intelligence can be used to address problems
like global health, food security, education, energy and climate change,
and asserted the conference has provided the ground for African voices
in AI to shape emerging global AI systems.</p>
<p>“I cannot overstate Africa’s growing importance in the global
technology landscape,” said Campbell. “By developing human capital and
strengthening research and innovation ecosystems and building and AI
ready institutional and regulatory environment, we can help AI work for
Africa. The African Union’s landmark AI strategy sets the roadmap for
African countries to harness AI’s potential to achieve developmental
aspirations in education, health, agriculture, infrastructure, peace and
security and good governance.”</p>
<p>In July, the African Union launched the continent’s Artificial
Intelligence Strategy, saying AI is pivotal in transforming Africa into
a global technology hub, and it called on member states to adopt the
strategy.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Nigeria’s minister of communication, innovation and
digital economy, Bosun Tijani, announced a $61,000 grant for Nigeria’s
brightest AI startups.</p>
<p>“For us to truly harness artificial intelligence for our collective
benefits, we must be deliberate and collaborative in our approach,” said
Tijani. “We just ensure that our digital transformation journey is
inclusive, equitable and human focused.”</p>
<p>Africa currently represents 2.5% of the global AI market, according
to the Artificial Intelligence for Development Africa, or AI4D.</p>
<p>But analysts say with more talks about safe use, AI applications
could boost Africa’s economy by $2.9 trillion by the year 2030 with
Kenya, South Africa and Nigerian markets taking the lead.</p>

<h2 id="solars-growing-farmland-problem">Solar’s Growing Farmland
Problem</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-11, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzYxNDgwNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczNTk5MDMzM30.PLkZ9ePIEsVSPohPX6xcN2JjJe-giBSsdrzvjLx_OpA/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=150%2C0%2C150%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
The solar energy industry has a big farm problem cropping up. And if it
isn’t careful, it’ll be dealing with it for years to come.
</p>
<p>
Researchers at SI2, an independent research arm of the Solar Energy
Industries Association, released a study of farm workers and solar
developers this morning that said almost half of all developers believe
it is “somewhat or significantly harder to do” projects on farmland,
despite the clear advantages that kind of property has for harnessing
solar power.
</p>
<p>
Unveiled in conjunction with RE+, the largest renewable energy
conference in the U.S.,
<a href="https://www.ssii.org/report-70-of-americas-farmers-open-to-solar-development/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
federally-funded research</u></a> includes a warning sign that
permitting is far and away the single largest impediment for solar
developers trying to build projects on farmland. If this trend continues
or metastasizes into a national movement, it could indefinitely lock
developers out from some of the nation’s best land for generating
carbon-free electricity.
</p>
<p>
“If a significant minority opposes and perhaps leads to additional
moratoria, [developers] will lose a foot in the door for any future
projects,” Shawn Rumery, SI2’s senior program director and the survey
lead, told me. “They may not have access to that community any more
because that moratoria is in place.”
</p>
<p>
SI2’s research comes on the heels of similar findings from Heatmap Pro.
A poll conducted for the platform last month found 70% of respondents
who had more than 50 acres of property — i.e. the kinds of large
landowners sought after by energy developers — are concerned that
renewable energy “takes up farmland,” by far the greatest objection
among that cohort.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Good farmland is theoretically perfect for building solar farms. What
could be better for powering homes than the same strong sunlight that
helps grow fields of yummy corn, beans and vegetables? And there’s a
clear financial incentive for farmers to get in on the solar industry,
not just because of the potential cash in letting developers use their
acres but also the longer-term risks climate change and extreme weather
can pose to agriculture writ large.
</p>
<p>
But not all farmers are warming up to solar power, leading towns and
counties across the country to enact moratoria restricting or banning
solar and wind development on and near “prime farmland.” Meanwhile at
the federal level, Republicans and Democrats alike are
<a href="https://bost.house.gov/2024/4/bost-introduces-bill-protecting-farm-land" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>voicing</u></a>

for crop production to generate renewable energy.
</p>
<p>
Seeking to best understand this phenomena, SI2 put out a call out for ag
industry representatives and solar developers to tell them how they feel
about these two industries co-mingling. They received 355 responses of
varying detail over roughly three months earlier this year, including
163 responses from agriculture workers, 170 from solar developers as
well as almost two dozen individuals in the utility sector.
</p>
<p>
A key hurdle to development, per the survey, is local opposition in farm
communities. SI2’s publicity announcement for the research focuses on a
hopeful statistic: up to 70% of farmers surveyed said they were “open to
large-scale solar.” But for many, that was only under certain conditions
that allow for dual usage of the land or agrivoltaics. In other words,
they’d want to be able to keep raising livestock, a practice known as
solar grazing, or planting crops unimpeded by the solar panels.
</p>
<p>
The remaining percentage of farmers surveyed “consistently opposed
large-scale solar under any condition,” the survey found.
</p>
<p>
“Some of the messages we got were <em><em>over my dead body</em></em>,”
Rumery said.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile a “non-trivial” number of solar developers reported being
unwilling or disinterested in adopting the solar-ag overlap that farmers
want due to the increased cost, Rumery said. While some companies expect
large portions of their business to be on farmland in the future, and
many who responded to the survey expect to use agrivoltaic designs,
Rumery voiced concern at the percentage of companies unwilling to
integrate simultaneous agrarian activities into their planning.
</p>
<p>
In fact, Rumery said some developers’ reticence is part of what drove
him and his colleagues to release the survey while at RE+.
</p>
<p>
As we discussed last week, failing to address the concerns of local
communities can lead to unintended consequences with industry-wide
ramifications. Rumery said developers trying to build on farmland should
consider adopting dual-use strategies and focus on community engagement
and education to avoid triggering future moratoria.
</p>
<p>
“One of the open-ended responses that best encapsulated the problem was
a developer who said until the cost of permitting is so high that it
forces us to do this, we’re going to continue to develop projects as
they are,” he said. “That’s a cold way to look at it.”
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, who is driving opposition to solar and other projects on
farmland? Are many small farm owners in rural communities really against
renewables? Is the fossil fuel lobby colluding with Big Ag? Could
building these projects on fertile soil really impede future prospects
at crop yields?
</p>
<p>
These are big questions we’ll be tackling in far more depth in next
week’s edition of The Fight. Trust me, the answers will surprise you.

<strong>1. Worcester County, Maryland </strong>–<strong> </strong>Ocean
City is preparing to go to court “if necessary” to undo the Bureau of
Ocean Energy Management’s
<a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-marks-major-milestones-offshore-wind-approves-tenth" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>approval
last week</u></a> of U.S. Wind’s Maryland Offshore Wind Project, town
mayor Rick Meehan told me in a statement this week.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Meehan listed off a litany of requests before the town apparently will
be comfortable with the project, including a review of Ocean City
property values, an economic study on impacts to the local economy, and
safety measures to address blade failures like what happened at Vineyard
Wind. Ultimately the town wants the project relocated “further to the
east, as we have been asking for the past seven and a half years.”
</li>
<li>
A lawsuit is definitely on the table but not guaranteed: “We will be
meeting with our consultants and attorneys to discuss our next course of
action. The last thing we want to do is go to court but we are prepared
to do so if necessary to make sure that all environmental protection
laws are complied with and that the safety and well-being of all our
citizens [is] protected.”

<strong>2. Magic Valley, Idaho </strong>– The Lava Ridge Wind Project
would be Idaho’s biggest wind farm. But it’s facing public outcry over

of World War II on Japanese residents in the United States.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If constructed, it would surround internment camps where Japanese people
were forcibly detained by the American government during the war.
Activists opposed to Lava Ridge say that constructing the project would
impact the solace of the space, killing the somber vibe. GOP politicians

On Friday, the federal advisory council overseeing historic preservation
law
<a href="https://www.achp.gov/news/achp-announces-termination-consultation-idaho-project" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ended
its consultation with regulators</a> on the wind project, which is
proposed by a subsidiary of LS Power.
</li>
<li>
The council cited a number of factors, including the inability to
mitigate impacts to the site as well as the unwillingness of Idaho state
historic site regulators to go along with consultation.
</li>
<li>
This has no apparent effect on project approval – at least not yet.
Whether it’ll mean much will be up to the Bureau of Land Management,
which takes into consideration the views of the advisory council in its
decisions.

craft heads to space station with 2 Russians, 1 American</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MOSCOW — A Soyuz spacecraft carrying two Russians and an American
blasted off Wednesday for an express trip to the International Space
Station. </p>
<p>The space capsule atop a towering rocket set off at 1623 GMT from
Russia’s manned space launch facility in Baikonur, Kazakhstan, and was
scheduled to dock with the space station three hours later, in contrast
to some missions that last for days. </p>
<p>The mission commander is Alexei Ovchinin, with Russian compatriot
Ivan Vagner and American Donald Pettit in the crew. </p>
<p>The blast-off took place without obvious problems and the Soyuz
entered orbit eight minutes after liftoff, a relief for Russian space
authorities after an automated safety system halted a launch in March
because of a voltage drop in the power system. </p>
<p>On the space station, Pettit, Vagner and Ovchinin will join NASA’s
Tracy Dyson, Mike Barratt, Matthew Dominick, Jeanette Epps, Butch
Wilmore, and Suni Williams, and Russians Nikolai Chub, Alexander
Grebenkin, and Oleg Kononenko.</p>

<a href="https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/2017391/510" target="_blank"><u>has
approved</u></a> NV Energy’s Greenlink West power line in Nevada, a
massive step forward for the Biden administration’s pursuit of more
transmission.<br/>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The project will be linked to Arevia Power’s Libra Solar Project, which
the BLM
<a href="https://www.blm.gov/press-release/blm-issues-final-analysis-libra-solar-project-nevada" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>finished

While these approvals might lift the weight off some YIMBY chests, I
wouldn’t be too sure this fight is over, judging by recent Fight

<p>
<strong>States’ offshore muddle </strong>– We saw a lot of state-level
offshore wind movement this past week… and it wasn’t entirely positive.
All of this bodes poorly for odds of a kumbaya political moment to the
industry’s benefit any time soon.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Massachusetts and Rhode Island picked three new projects that will
ultimately produce less
<a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2024/09/06/massachusetts-tristate-offshore-wind-auction-electricity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>power
than they wanted</u></a>. Connecticut did not pick any projects despite
expectations it would do so,
<a href="https://www.ctpublic.org/news/2024-09-06/offshore-wind-massachusetts-rhode-island-connecticut" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>delaying
the decision</u></a> to a later, unspecified date.
</li>
<li>
Oregon got the
<a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2024/09/05/southern-oregon-offshore-wind-turbines/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>federal
go-ahead</u></a> for offshore development in its waters. But this
received backlash from the state’s two senators, Ron Wyden and Jeff
Merkley, who said the

</li>
<li>
It wasn’t all bad news. Last week, Delaware Gov. John Carney signed into

<li>
But I’m watching to see if an Oregon-esque situation plays out in
Delaware, a state with many politicians

<strong>Chumash loophole</strong> – Offshore wind did notch one win in
northern California by securing an industry exception in a large marine
sanctuary, providing for farms to be built in a corridor of the
coastline.

planned <em><em>and </em></em>the blessing of the North Chumash Tribal
Council – what appears to be a win-win.
</li>
<li>
Regulators say they’ll consider a potential expansion of the sanctuary
in the “coming years” after transmission cables have been approved.

<p>
This week I’m in Anaheim wandering the halls of RE+ for the first time.
It’s been a thrill to learn about the cavalcade of companies working on
the frontlines of the energy transition. I’ll have a LOT more to say
about my trip in next week’s edition of The Fight. But during my first
day there I decided to ask a few impressive individuals to sit in my hot
seat. Here’s what they said!<br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Becca Jones-Albertus – Director of the Energy Department’s Solar
Energy Technologies Office</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Does the federal government’s neutrality on what U.S. regions
are best for renewables help or hurt the energy transition, given how
many competing interests are at play? </strong>“I think for our country
it helps. It provides more opportunities for local areas to engage and
take charge of their own futures. The clean energy transition doesn’t
depend on whether we develop a plan in [one] particular area. That means
there are more communities that can engage, can push for benefits for
those systems. There’s more room and opportunity there.”
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Kevin Diau – CEO of 1Climate, an AI permitting assistance
tool</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Can AI help with NIMBY problems?</strong> “I think AI can make
it easier to understand where all those regulations are that exist. But
I think that a lot of the challenges when it comes to people having
NIMBY conflicts, that’s a lot of interpersonal dynamics that AI can’t
necessarily address head on. I think developers still have these NIMBY
challenges from people in the community.”
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Charles Dauber – CEO of Empact Technologies, policy consulting
firm</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>What’s the question you’ve been asked most about the IRA at RE+?
</strong>“Even though the IRA’s been around for like, two years, it
turns out given safe harbor last year, many companies didn’t have to
deal with this until now. So we’re just now starting to get questions
about dealing with prevailing wage and apprenticeship compliance
requirements. We see that probably from 70% of the people that walk up
here: <em><em>How do I go do this? I’m getting requirements from my
investors that want to prove we’re going to be compliant with these
requirements.</em></em>”

<p>date: 2024-09-11, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
It was — against all odds —
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-harris-debate-fracking" target="_self"><u>an</u></a>
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-harris-debate-climate-change" target="_self"><u>energy</u></a>
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-solar-400-500-acres-of-desert-soil" target="_self"><u>debate</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Just look at the statistics. The word “fracking” was mentioned 10 times.
“Oil” came up seven times. Even “climate change,” which Donald Trump was
not very eager to talk about, was mentioned four times. And while that
may not seem like a lot for such a vast and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-harris-debate-germany-normal-energy" target="_self"><u>globe-spanning</u></a>
problem, climate change came up only three times in
<em><em>all</em></em> of 2016’s debates combined.
</p>
<p>
Even more than when talking about trade or inflation, Vice President
Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump used energy to make
their economic vision concrete and meaningful to Americans. For Harris,
that meant recognizing the scale of the country’s fossil fuel resources
today while gesturing toward a cleaner and lower-carbon future that will
produce (in theory, at least) lots of high-wage manufacturing jobs for
America’s middle class. For Trump, the energy industry — and, really,
the fossil fuel industry — is central to his fleshy, authoritarian
vision of American strength. Seemingly any attempt to replace
hydrocarbons with something cleaner or less polluting arises from
nothing less than an elite conspiracy to weaken the country and sell out
its people.
</p>
<p>
For such a stark contrast — and for such an <em><em>outlandish</em></em>
contrast, to be clear — it was a surprisingly substantive debate. Which
isn’t to say we learned much, especially about Trump. The Republican
nominee was the same man we’ve seen for the past nine years, the same
politician who has defined the extreme GOP position on global warming.
Over the past near-decade, Trump has called climate change a
“<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-intro" target="_self"><u>hoax</u></a>”
and
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/11/ideology-behind-donald-trumps-paris-withdrawal/601462/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
seemed to revel</u></a> in emissions-increasing policies. That isn’t
changing. Asked directly what he would do about climate change on
Tuesday night, he did not address the question at all. Instead, he
talked about how car factories are getting built in Mexico, and he
claimed in a difficult-to-follow rant that Joe Biden is getting paid off
by China.
</p>
<p>
About Harris, we learned far more. Harris struck a careful, moderate
tone during the debate between the need for climate action and the
ongoing importance of fossil fuel extraction. She spoke about the
Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration’s signature climate
policy, but also discussed how it increased federal leasing for oil and
gas. She spoke about climate change in terms of its higher everyday
costs for Americans, and not — as Biden did — as an existential threat
to the country.
</p>
<p>
“What we know is that [climate change] is very real,” she said. “You ask
anyone who lives in a state who has experienced these extreme weather
occurrences, who now is either being denied home insurance or [it] is
being jacked up.”
</p>
<p>
She bragged about the Biden administration’s oil and gas record in the
same breath as she discussed its enormous investments in clean energy.
American oil and gas production is at an all-time high — it is higher,
in fact, than Saudi Arabia’s — but I can’t remember hearing a Biden
administration official bragging about that.
</p>
<p>
“I am proud that as vice president over the last four years, we have
invested a trillion dollars in a clean energy economy while we have also
increased domestic gas production to historic levels,” she said.
</p>
<p>
In a way, Harris has essentially returned to Obama’s 2012 “all of the
above” energy policy. That approach remains unpopular with climate
activists, who think it did too much for the oil and gas industry;
personally, I think it’s an open question whether Obama actually
believed in the “all of the above” approach or was subtly trying to help
renewables all along. But more importantly, the underlying policy
context is totally different now than it was 12 years ago: With the
Inflation Reduction Act in place, the government can more easily bless
all forms of energy development because it is, in fact, helping clean
energy take root.
</p>
<p>
What’s most important, though — and what I hope climate advocates do not
overlook — is that Harris’s tack here reflects the broad state of
American public opinion. While most Americans
<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/474485/support-slashing-fossil-fuel-steady.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>want
to reduce</u></a> greenhouse gas emissions, they do not seem to want an
energy revolution: More than two-thirds of Americans believe the country
should use a mix of renewables and fossil fuels,
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/06/28/what-americans-think-about-an-energy-transition-from-fossil-fuels-to-renewables/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according
to the Pew Research Center</u></a>, and less than a third believe the
country should rely “entirely” on renewables. In the same poll, most
Americans
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2024/06/27/how-americans-view-national-local-and-personal-energy-choices/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said
they oppose</u></a> federal rules that would aim to make electric
vehicles half of all new cars sold by 2032.
</p>
<p>
This is not to say that Americans are big oil lovers. Most Americans
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2024/06/27/views-on-energy-development-in-the-u-s/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>think</u></a>
the country should prioritize various forms of zero-carbon energy
development over fossil fuels. And while Republican support for
renewables has dropped over the past few years — and has fallen
further<em> </em>over the past few months<em><em>, </em></em>as my
colleague Matthew Zeitlin
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/clean-energy-polarization-election" target="_self"><u>wrote</u></a>
recently — a generation gap has emerged wherein younger Republicans are
much more likely to champion solar and wind than older party members.
</p>
<p>
Even among seemingly environmental-aligned demographics, greater support
exists for fossil fuels than one might expect. Most Democrats say they
would not “favor” expanding fracking or offshore drilling — but about a
quarter<em> </em>of Democrats<em> </em>would favor more fossil fuel
drilling. So would roughly 45% of independents and, of course, a large
majority of Republicans, according to Pew.
</p>
<p>
Of course, these facts of public opinion sit uneasily with what we know
about climate change, which is that greenhouse gas emissions — and
fossil fuel development with it — should plan to scale down soon. The
International Energy Association
<a href="https://www.iea.org/news/the-path-to-limiting-global-warming-to-1-5-c-has-narrowed-but-clean-energy-growth-is-keeping-it-open" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
said</u></a> that the most likely pathway for keeping global warming to
1.5 degrees Celsius requires the development of “no new long lead-time
upstream oil or gas projects.” This observation provides less guidance
for American policy makers than it might initially seem, because it is
really focused on the opening of new, massive oil fields
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-68715850" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>like
Guyana’s</u></a>. (The IEA also says, in almost the same breath, that
“continued investment is required in some existing oil and gas
projects,” which could possibly justify ongoing extraction from Texas’s
well-established oil and gas fields.)
</p>
<p>
But even then, the non-negotiable fact would remain: The world must move
away from fossil fuels. And the American people are not generally ready
to do that today. The country wants something closer to an “all of the
above” strategy than it wants a Green New Deal.
</p>
<p>
That strategy brings climate policy out of the ideological realm and
into the pragmatic. Americans, polling suggests, like renewables in part
because they will let the United States reduce its dependence on foreign
oil, a popular idea in and of itself and talking point of both parties
going back decades.
</p>
<p>
When Heatmap polled more than 5,000 Americans last month, more than half
said that a “strong benefit” of a given clean energy project would be
its ability to reduce the country’s dependence on foreign oil and
natural gas. Among respondents, those putative energy independence
benefits were the No. 2 most popular reason to support clean energy; the
only <em><em>more </em></em>popular rationale for backing a project was
that it would cut utility bills.
</p>
<p>
Harris directly echoed that appeal on Tuesday. “My position is that we
have got to invest in diverse sources of energy so we reduce our
reliance on foreign oil,” she said. “We have had the largest increase in
domestic oil production in history because of an approach that
recognizes that we cannot over rely on foreign oil.”
</p>
<p>
I can’t remember Biden making an appeal like this. When he talks about
clean energy or the IRA, he tends to focus on its potential to grow the
economy. Harris did some of that on Tuesday, bragging about the 800,000
new manufacturing jobs created during her vice presidency. But her focus
on the national interest — and on the Biden administration’s
appreciation of the ongoing fossil boom — was new.
</p>
<p>
Such an approach is unlikely to help her appeal to climate activists and
advocates, who want the government to affirmatively begin to shutter
fossil capacity. The Sunrise Movement, a climate activist group,
<a href="https://x.com/sunrisemvmt/status/1833719577433268254?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>criticized</u></a>
Harris on Tuesday for spending “more time promoting fracking than laying
out a bold vision for a clean energy future.”
</p>
<p>
What I’d advise those advocates to keep in mind is that their views are
legitimately not very popular, and Harris is trying to win a very close
election in a race that her team believes has
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/10/trump-gop-support-jd-vance-2024/679564/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>potentially
existential stakes</u></a> for American democracy. She also remembers
the 2020 primary, when she tacked left on virtually every issue — she
promised to ban fracking, for instance — and still lost. (If that’s
because many of the groups wound up backing Bernie Sanders in that
primary, that only reinforces the view that she can’t win over those
voters in the first place.)
</p>
<p>
Harris isn’t defying the left on every issue — she has resisted
neoliberal dogma and
<a href="https://www.joshbarro.com/p/i-said-democrats-should-pander-more" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pandered
to the public’s views</u></a> on price gouging, for instance, putting
her more in line with the Democratic Party’s Elizabeth Warren wing. But
unlike Biden, she refuses to pay an electoral price for backing
left-wing policies. Indeed, she seems to believe that she <em><em>cannot
</em></em>pay such a price and still win. If Harris is now bragging
about her administration’s support for fossil fuels, if she is casting

<h2 id="us-house-republicans-cancel-vote-on-stopgap-funding-measure">US
House Republicans cancel vote on stopgap funding measure</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson
canceled a vote scheduled for Wednesday on his stopgap funding bill,
saying more work is needed to build support for a measure, less than
three weeks before a government shutdown deadline. </p>
<p>“No vote today, because we’re in the consensus-building business here
in Congress, with small majorities, and that’s what you do,” Johnson
told reporters at the Capitol. </p>
<p>The vote had been set for later on Wednesday. </p>
<p>Johnson added that Republicans will be working through the weekend to
find a bill that would gain enough votes for passage, now that his
measure, opposed by President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats, has
faltered. </p>
<p>House Republicans have attached a controversial provision requiring
people to provide proof of citizenship to register to vote, a measure
meant to force Democrats to take stances on the politically charged
issue of non-citizen voting, which is already illegal in federal
elections. </p>
<p>Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who continues to
falsely claim his 2020 loss was the result of fraud, has urged
Republicans to pass the voting measure ahead of the November 5
election. </p>
<p>The federal government’s fiscal year ends on September 30, when
funding for many agencies expires. Without some sort of extension,
federal programs not deemed essential would have to suspend many of
their operations, forcing thousands of government workers to go on
leave. </p>
<p>Success for the funding bill was not guaranteed in the chamber that
Republicans control by a narrow 220-211 margin. Several House
Republicans have said they would vote against the measure, citing
spending concerns, and many members of the caucus generally oppose
stopgap spending measures. </p>
<p>Two Republicans joined Democrats on Tuesday in voting against a
procedural move to advance the bill. </p>
<p>Democrats broadly see the citizenship registration requirement as
meant to undermine confidence in administering elections. </p>
<p>“We’re watching a movie we’ve seen over and over again,” said Senate
Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday. “House Republicans are trying
to pass a bill so partisan that it even splits their own caucus. This
proposal isn’t even serious.” </p>
<p>The White House on Monday said Biden would veto this funding package
were it to pass, citing the “unrelated cynical” voting requirement. The
administration also wants a temporary funding period shorter than six
months, as well as more money for the Federal Emergency Management
Agency to fix infrastructure damaged by natural disasters. </p>
<p>Lawmakers face an even more critical self-imposed deadline on January
1, before which they must act to raise or extend the nation’s debt
ceiling or risk defaulting on more than $35 trillion in federal
government debt.</p>

<p>
At least one natural gas plant in America’s biggest energy market that
was scheduled to shut down is staying open. Elgin Energy Center, an
approximately 500 megawatt plant in Illinois approximately 40 miles
northwest of downtown Chicago was scheduled to shut down next June,
according to filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and
officials from PJM Interconnection, the country’s largest regional
transmission organization, which governs the relevant portion of the
U.S. grid. Elgin’s parent company “no longer intends to deactivate and
retire all four units … at the Elgin Energy Center,” according to a
letter dated September 4 and posted to PJM’s website
Wednesday.<del></del>
</p>
<p>
The Illinois plant is something of a poster child for PJM’s past few
years. In 2022, it was one of many natural gas plants to shut down
during Winter Storm Elliott as the natural gas distribution seized up.
Its then-parent company, Lincoln Power —
<a href="https://www.cogentrix.com/news/three-illinois-peakers-added-cogentrix-fleet" target="_blank"><u>owned
by Cogentrix</u></a>, the Carlyle Group’s vehicle for its power business
—
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-31/us-power-plant-firm-goes-bankrupt-after-winter-storm-penalties" target="_blank"><u>filed
for bankruptcy the following year</u></a>, after PJM assessed almost $40
million in penalties for failing to operate during the storm. In June,
<a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bankruptcy-law/avenue-capitals-26-million-lincoln-power-deal-wins-approval" target="_blank"><u>a
bankruptcy court</u></a> approved the acquisition of the Elgin plant,
along with one other<strong>, </strong>by Middle River Power, a
generation business backed by Avenue Capital, a $12 billion investment
firm, in a deal that was closed in December.
</p>
<p>
The decision to continue operating the plant past its planned
deactivation comes as PJM
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/pjm-natural-gas" target="_blank">set
a new price record</a> at its capacity auction in July, during which
generators submitted bids for power that can be deployed when the grid
is under stress due to high demand. The $14.7 billion auction was a
massive jump from the previous one, which finished a<strong>t</strong>
just over $2 billion. Ironically, one reason the most recent auction was
so expensive is that PJM gave less credit to natural gas generators for
their capacity following Winter Storm Elliott, which then drove up
auction prices, leading to large payouts for gas plants. PJM said the
<a href="https://www.pjm.com/-/media/about-pjm/newsroom/2024-releases/20240730-pjm-capacity-auction-procures-sufficient-resources-to-meet-rto-reliability-requirement.ashx" target="_blank"><u>high
auction prices were</u></a> “caused primarily by a large number of
generator retirements.”
</p>
<p>
<span></span>In a
<a href="https://casedocs.omniagentsolutions.com/cmsvol2/pub_47469/70cb284e-adfd-4d60-8286-894b0679355f_12.pdf" target="_blank"><u>bankruptcy
court filing in 2023</u></a>, Lincoln Power’s chief restructuring
officer said that the company “was experiencing a liquidity crunch” due
to low prices in past capacity auction, which meant that it had
“received significantly less revenues for the capacity they sold in
those Capacity Auctions as compared to previous Capacity Auctions.” With
higher capacity revenues in PJM, presumably Elgin’s business has
improved.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Many analysts are skeptical that PJM can quickly get new
load onto the system to bring prices down meaningfully in subsequent
auctions — the next one is in December — and the PJM queue for new
projects is absurdly clogged. This only juices the incentives for older
fossil plants to stay open.
</p>
<p>
<span style="background-color: initial;">“This shortage of capacity is
happening immediately,” Nicholas Freschi, senior associate at Gabel
Associates, told me last week. “There might be more resources, and PJM
might be able to coerce some retiring or not participating plants to
make up for the shortfall. It’s an immediate problem.”</span>
</p>

Neither Middle River nor its attorney representing the company before
FERC returned requests for comment.<br/>

id="hellish-scene-unfolds-as-wildfire-races-toward-california-mountain-community">‘Hellish’
scene unfolds as wildfire races toward California mountain
community</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TRABUCO CANYON, California — Alex Luna, a 20-year-old missionary, saw
the sky turn from a cherry red to black in about 90 minutes as an
explosive wildfire raced toward the Southern California mountain
community of Wrightwood and authorities implored residents to leave
their belongings behind and get out of town. </p>
<p>“It was very, I would say, hellish-like,” Luna said Tuesday night.
“It was very just dark. Not a good place to be at that moment. … Ash was
falling from the sky like if it was snowing.” </p>
<p>Luna was among those who heeded the evacuation order that was issued
for the community of about 4,500 in the San Gabriel Mountains east of
Los Angeles. The Bridge Fire, which had burned 189 square kilometers (73
square miles) as of late Tuesday with no containment, is one of three
major wildfires burning in Southern California and endangering tens of
thousands of homes and other structures. </p>
<p>The fires sprung to life during a triple-digit heat wave that finally
broke Wednesday. The cooler temperatures brought the prospect of
firefighters finally making headway against the flames. </p>
<p>Other major fires were burning across the West, including in Idaho,
Oregon and Nevada, where about 20,000 people had to flee a blaze outside
Reno. </p>
<p>In Northern California, a fire that started Sunday burned at least 30
homes and commercial buildings and destroyed 40 to 50 vehicles in
Clearlake City, 175 kilometers (109 miles) north of San Francisco.
Roughly 4,000 people were forced to evacuate. </p>
<p>California is only now heading into the teeth of the wildfire season
but already has seen nearly three times as much acreage burn than during
all of 2023. </p>
<p>Evacuation orders were expanded Tuesday night in Southern California
as the fires grew and included parts of the popular ski town of Big
Bear. Some 65,600 homes and buildings were under threat by the Line
Fire, including those under mandatory evacuations and those under
evacuation warnings, nearly double the number from the previous
day. </p>
<p>The San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department announced Tuesday that
a Norco man suspected of starting the Line Fire in Highland on September
5 had been arrested and charged with arson. He was held in lieu of
$80,000 bail. </p>
<p>Residents along the southern edge of Big Bear Lake were told to leave
the area, which is a popular destination for anglers, bikers and hikers.
As of late Tuesday, the blaze had charred more than 140 square
kilometers (54 square miles) of grass and brush with 14% containment,
according to CalFire. It blanketed the area with a thick cloud of dark
smoke. </p>
<p>The fire impacted key radio towers, including communication channels
for those responding to the fire. Cooler weather could moderate fire
activity toward the end of the week, CalFire said in an update. Public
safety power shut-offs were anticipated in parts of the Big Bear and
Bear Valley areas. </p>
<p>The acrid air prompted several districts in the area to close schools
through the end of the week because of safety concerns. Three
firefighters have been injured since the blaze was reported Thursday,
state fire managers said. </p>
<p>For Wrightwood, a picturesque town 124 kilometers (77 miles) east of
Los Angeles known for its 1930’s cabins. threatening wildfires have
become a regular part of life. Authorities expressed frustration in 2016
when only half the residents heeded orders to leave. </p>
<p>Janice Quick, the president of the Wrightwood Chamber of Commerce,
lives a few miles outside town. Late Tuesday afternoon she was eating
lunch outside with friends and they were rained on by embers the size of
her thumbnail that hit the table and made a clinking sound. </p>
<p>A friend texted to tell her that the friend’s home had been consumed
by fire, while another friend was watching through her ring camera as
embers rained down on her home. </p>
<p>“I’ve never seen anything like this and I’ve been through fires
before,” said Quick, who has lived in Wrightwood for 45 years. </p>
<p>In neighboring Orange County, firefighters used bulldozers,
helicopters and planes to control a rapidly spreading blaze called the
Airport Fire that started Monday and spread to about 8 square kilometers
(3 square miles) in only a few hours. The blaze was ignited by a spark
from heavy equipment being used by public workers, officials said. </p>
<p>By Tuesday night, it had charred more than 78 square kilometers (30
square miles) and was heading over mountainous terrain into neighboring
Riverside County with no containment, said Orange County Fire Authority
Capt. Steve Concialdi. It burned some communications towers on top of a
peak, though so far officials said they did not have reports of the
damage disrupting police or fire communication signals in the area. </p>
<p>Concialdi said the fire was burning away from homes in Orange County,
but there are 36 recreational cabins in the area. He said authorities
don’t yet know if the cabins were damaged or destroyed by the
blaze. </p>
<p>Two firefighters who suffered heat-related injuries and a resident
who suffered from smoke inhalation were treated at a hospital and
released. </p>
<p>Sherri Fankhauser, her husband and her daughter set up lawn chairs
and were watching helicopters make water drops on a flaming hillside a
few hundred yards away from their Trabuco Canyon home on Tuesday. </p>
<p>They didn’t evacuate even though their street had been under a
mandatory evacuation order since Monday. A neighbor did help
Fankhauser’s 89-year-old mother-in-law evacuate, Fankhauser said. The
flames died down last night but flared up again in the morning. </p>
<p>“You can see fire coming over the ridge now,” Fankhauser said Tuesday
afternoon. “It’s getting a little scarier now.”</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>And the hits just keep on coming. After buying an ad tech company and
working with Facebook to weaken Firefox’ privacy features, Mozilla is
now integrating AI chatbots straight into Firefox with the recent
release of Firefox 130. People are understandably big mad about this,
and as such the calls for switching to alternatives is growing stronger.
Considering the only true alternative to Firefox is Chrome and its
various skins, those of us looking to send Mozilla a message are kind of
relegated to trying out Firefox skins instead. Switching to what are
essentially “Firefox distros” to collectively try and nudge Mozilla back
to making more sensible decisions instead of AI hype chasing is an
eminently reasonable one. There’s more reasons than just that. Part of
the reason I use Firefox-based browsers rather than Chromium browsers is
because I want to preserve some choice and diversity in browser engines.
The existence of a choice of different Firefox derived browsers may
allow space for experimentation in designing better browsers. In
Chromium land, Arc has shown that there’s an opportunity for quite
radically rethinking how browsers work. Same for Orion in Mac/iOS-land.
This isn’t a detailed review of the different browsers, just a few
comments and observations having tried them. ↫ Tom Morris I have my
reservations about using Firefox skins, mostly because no matter what
you do, you’re still entirely dependent on the choices Mozilla makes
during the development of the venerable browser. If Mozilla keeps
deviating from the traditional goals more and more, the amount of work
these Firefox skins need to perform to reign the browser back in will
start to increase, and who knows if they have the manpower, experience,
and skills to do so? More worryingly, will they be able to keep up with
Mozilla’s release schedule, including important bugfixes and security
patches? My worries go beyond those basic things, though. Considerably
fewer eyes will be going over any code changes these Firefox-based
browsers make, and as recent history has shown us, infiltrating a small,
understaffed open source project for nefarious purposes is a thing that
happens. Another issue to consider is nebulous ownership of such Firefox
versions, as are questions around who financially supports such efforts.
Your browser is a massively important and crucial piece of software that
holds and has access to a lot of your personal data, and you should be
particularly careful about who owns your browser. This is not to say
each and every one of them is bad – just that you have to be careful
about who you trust. Several Chrome skins, like Brave and Opera, have
time and time again shown to be shady, untrustworthy companies pushing
crypto bullshit, ripping off websites, have shady owners, and more –
don’t use Brave, don’t use Opera – and there’s no guarantees the same
won’t happen with Firefox skins riding the wave of unhappiness with
Mozilla. Please be mindful. I don’t have an answer for this issue,
either – I just want to caution against throwing the browser out with
the bath water and switching to a project you might not know a lot
about.</p>

<h2 id="joining-thrive-capital">Joining Thrive Capital</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-11, from: The Sephist blog</p>
<p>
I’ve joined <a href="https://thrivecap.com/">Thrive Capital</a> as an
EIR and advisor, working with the Thrive team to support our founders in
understanding and deploying AI thoughtfully, while furthering my own
research and explorations around AI interpretability, knowledge
representations, and interface design.
</p>
<p>
August was my last month as a part of Notion’s AI engineering team.
</p>
<p>
It’s been a privilege at Notion to get to work with a world-class team
at the frontier of applied LLM products. Notion was one of the first
companies to preview an LLM product, even before ChatGPT. I’m grateful
to have been a part of the many ways the team has grown in the last
almost-two years, across product launches, generational leaps in models,
and many orders of magnitude of scale. We learned alongside the rest of
the industry about prompt programming, retrieval, agents, evals, and how
people are using AI day-to-day in their schools, companies, meetings,
and life.
</p>
<p>
Notion’s “AI team” is really a team-of-teams spanning product, design,
engineering, partnerships, finance, marketing, sales, and growth across
the company. With all the talented Notinos that have joined since my
first days, Notion’s AI team is poised to build and share a lot of
beautiful, useful products in the next months, I have no doubt.
</p>
<p>
As Notion brings all the ideas we’ve explored (and more) to the world,
I’ve been feeling an urge to (1) take a step back and understand how the
broader world is adapting to this new technology, and (2) spend much
more time on my research agendas around interpretability and interfaces.
</p>
<p>
After a brief break, I joined Thrive earlier this month.
</p>
<p>
As I’ve gotten to know the Thrive team over the last couple years, I’ve
been consistently impressed with the thoughtfulness, depth of
partnership with founders, and clarity of conviction behind investments
across stages and industries. They’ve generously granted me an ambitious
remit to pursue both of my goals as a part of the team, and based on my
first week I’ve got a lot to be excited about on both fronts.
</p>
<p>
I hope to share what I learn and build along the way, as I always have.

id="us-inflation-reaches-3-year-low-as-federal-reserve-prepares-to-cut-interest-rates">US
inflation reaches 3-year low as Federal Reserve prepares to cut interest
rates</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The post-pandemic spike in U.S. inflation eased further
last month as year-over-year price increases reached a three-year low,
clearing the way for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates next
week.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s report from the Labor Department showed that consumer
prices rose 2.5% in August from a year earlier. It was the fifth
straight annual drop and the smallest such increase since February 2021.
From July to August, prices rose just 0.2%.</p>
<p>Excluding volatile food and energy costs, so-called core prices rose
3.2% in August from 12 months earlier, the same as in July. On a
month-to-month basis, core prices rose 0.3% last month, a pickup from
July’s 0.2% increase. Economists closely watch core prices, which
typically provide a better read of future inflation trends.</p>
<p>For months, cooling inflation has provided gradual relief to
America’s consumers, who were stung by the price surges that erupted
three years ago, particularly for food, gas, rent and other necessities.
Inflation peaked in mid-2022 at 9.1%, the highest rate in four
decades.</p>
<p>Fed officials have signaled that they’re increasingly confident that
inflation is falling back to their 2% target and are now shifting their
focus to supporting the job market, which is steadily cooling. As a
result, the policymakers are poised to begin cutting their key rate from
its 23-year high in hopes of bolstering growth and hiring.</p>
<p>A modest quarter-point cut is widely expected next week. Over time, a
series of rate cuts should reduce the cost of borrowing across the
economy, including for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.</p>
<p>The latest inflation figures could inject themselves into the
presidential race in its final weeks. Former President Donald Trump has
heaped blame on Vice President Kamala Harris for the jump in inflation,
which erupted in early 2021 as global supply chains seized up, causing
severe shortages of parts and labor. Harris has proposed subsidies for
home buyers and builders in an effort to ease housing costs and backs a
federal ban on price-gouging for groceries. Trump has said he would
boost energy production to try to reduce overall inflation.</p>
<p>A key reason why inflation eased again in August was that gas prices
tumbled by about 10 cents a gallon last month, according to the Energy
Inflation Administration, to a national average of about $3.29.</p>
<p>Economists also expect the government’s measures of grocery prices
and rents to rise more slowly. Though food prices are roughly 20% more
expensive than before the pandemic, they have barely budged over the
past year.</p>
<p>Another potential driver of slower inflation is that the cost of new
apartment leases has started to cool as a stream of newly built
apartments have been completed.</p>
<p>According to the real estate brokerage Redfin, the median rent for a
new lease rose just 0.9% in August from a year earlier, to $1,645 a
month. But the government’s measure includes all rents, including those
for people who have been in their apartments for months or years. It
takes time for the slowdown in new rents to show up in the government’s
data. In July, rental costs rose 5.1% from a year ago, according to the
government’s consumer price index.</p>
<p>Americans’ paychecks are also growing more slowly — an average of
about 3.5% annually, still a solid pace — which reduces inflationary
pressures. Two years ago, wage growth was topping 5%, a level that can
force businesses to sharply raise prices to cover their higher labor
costs.</p>
<p>In a high-profile speech last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted
that inflation was coming under control and suggested that the job
market was unlikely to be a source of inflationary pressure.</p>
<p>Consumers have propelled the economy for the past three years. But
they are increasingly turning to debt to maintain their spending and
credit card, and auto delinquencies are rising, raising concerns that
they may have to rein in their spending soon. Reduced consumer spending
could lead more employers to freeze their hiring or even cut jobs.</p>

<h2 id="hurricane-francine-takes-aim-at-louisiana-coast">Hurricane
Francine takes aim at Louisiana coast</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BATON ROUGE, La. — Hurricane Francine barreled early Wednesday toward
Louisiana and is expected to make landfall in coming hours as
forecasters raised threats of potentially deadly storm surge, widespread
flooding and destructive winds on the northern U.S. Gulf coast.</p>
<p>Francine drew fuel from exceedingly warm Gulf of Mexico waters to
jump from a tropical storm to a Category 1 hurricane on Tuesday night.
The National Hurricane Center said Francine might even reach Category 2
strength with winds of 155 to 175 kph before crashing into a fragile
coastal region that still hasn’t fully recovered from a series of
devastating hurricanes since 2020.</p>
<p>Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry warned at midday Tuesday — when Francine
was still a tropical storm — that residents around south Louisiana and
in the heavily populated state capital of Baton Rouge and nearby New
Orleans — should “batten down all the hatches” and finish last
preparations before a 24-hour window to do so closed.</p>
<p>Once Francine makes landfall, Landry said, residents should stay in
place rather than venture out into waterlogged roads and risk blocking
first responders or utility crews working to repair power lines.</p>
<p>The governor said the Louisiana National Guard is being deployed to
parishes that could be impacted by Francine. They are equipped with
food, water, nearly 400 high-water vehicles, about 100 boats and 50
helicopters to respond to the storm, including possible
search-and-rescue operations.</p>
<p>Francine was centered Wednesday morning about 395 kilometers
southwest of Morgan City, Louisiana, and was moving northeast at 17 kph
with maximum sustained winds of 90 150 kmh, the Miami-based hurricane
center said. Some additional strengthening is expected Wednesday morning
and then Francine is expected to weaken quickly after it moves
inland.</p>
<p>A hurricane warning was in effect along the Louisiana coast from
Cameron eastward to Grand Isle, about 80 kilometers south of New
Orleans, according to the center. A storm surge warning stretched from
the Mississippi-Alabama border to the Alabama-Florida border Such a
warning means there’s a chance of life-threatening flooding.</p>
<p>In downtown New Orleans, cars and trucks were lined up for blocks on
Tuesday to collect sandbags from the parking lot of a local YMCA. CEO
Erika Mann said Tuesday that 1,000 bags of sand had already been
distributed by volunteers later in the day to people hoping to protect
homes from possible flooding.</p>
<p>One resident picking up sandbags was Wayne Grant, 33, who moved to
New Orleans last year and was nervous for his first potential hurricane
in the city. The low-lying rental apartment he shares with his partner
had already flooded out in a storm the year before and he was not taking
any chances this time around.</p>
<p>“It was like a kick in the face, we’ve been trying to stay up on the
weather ever since,” Grant said. “We’re super invested in the place,
even though it’s not ours.”</p>
<p>Francine is the sixth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season.
There’s a danger of life-threatening storm surge as well as damaging
hurricane-force winds, said Brad Reinhart, a senior hurricane specialist
at the hurricane center.</p>
<p>There’s also the potential for 10 to 20 centimeters of rain with the
possibility of 30 centimeters locally across much of Louisiana and
Mississippi through Friday morning, Reinhart said.</p>
<p>The hurricane center said parts of Mississippi, Alabama and the
Florida Panhandle were at risk of “considerable” flash and urban
flooding starting Wednesday, followed by a threat of possible flooding
later in the week into the lower Mississippi Valley and lower Tennessee
Valley as the soggy remnants of Francine sweep inland.</p>
<p>Francine is taking aim at a Louisiana coastline that has yet to fully
recover since hurricanes Laura and Delta decimated Lake Charles in 2020,
followed a year later by Hurricane Ida.</p>
<p>A little over three years after Ida trashed his home in the Dulac
community of coastal Louisiana’s Terrebonne Parish – and about a month
after he finished rebuilding – Coy Verdin was preparing for another
hurricane.</p>
<p>“We had to gut the whole house,” he recalled in a telephone
interview, rattling off a memorized inventory of the work, including a
new roof and new windows.</p>
<p>Verdin, 55, strongly considered moving farther inland, away from the
home where he makes his living on nearby Bayou Grand Caillou. After
rebuilding, he said he’s there to stay.</p>
<p>“As long as I can. It’s getting rough, though,” he said.</p>
<p>Francine’s storm surge on the Louisiana coast could reach as much as
3 meters from Cameron to Port Fourchon and into Vermilion Bay,
forecasters said. They said landfall was likely somewhere between Sabine
Pass — on the Texas-Louisiana line — and Morgan City, Louisiana, about
350 kilometers to the east.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Maybe you’ve never heard of it. Maybe you know it too well. But to a
certain type of clean energy wonk, it amounts to perhaps the three most
dreaded words in climate policy: the interconnection queue.
</p>
<p>
The queue is the process by which utilities decide which wind and solar
farms get to hook up to the power grid in the United States. Across much
of the country, it has become so badly broken and clogged that it can
take more than a decade for a given project to navigate.
</p>
<p>
On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Jesse and Rob speak with two
experts about how to understand — and how to fix — what is perhaps the
biggest obstacle to deploying more renewables on the U.S. power grid.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>Can I interject and just ask why, over
the past decade, the interconnection queue got much longer — but also
over the past decade, 15 years, the U.S. grid did change in character
and in fuel type a lot, right? We went from burning a lot of coal to a
lot of natural gas. And that transition is often cited as one of the
model transitions, one of the few energy transitions to happen globally
that happened at the speed with which we would need to decarbonize.
Obviously, switching coal to gas is not decarbonizing, but it is a model
— it happened fast enough that it is a good model for what decarbonizing
would look like in order to meet climate goals.<br/> <br/> Evidently,
that did not run into these kind of same interconnection queue problems.
Why is that? Is that because we were swapping in within individual power
plants? We were just changing the furnace from a coal furnace to a gas
furnace? Is that because these were larger projects and so it didn’t
back up in the queue in the same way that a lot of smaller solar or wind
farms do? <br/> <br/> <strong>Claire Wayner: </strong>I would say all
the reasons you just gave are valid, yeah. The coal to gas transition
involved, likely, a lot of similar geographic locations. With wind and
solar, we’re seeing them wanting to build on the grid and in a lot of
cases in new, rather remote locations that are going to require new
types of grid upgrades that the coal to gas transition just doesn’t
have.<br/> <br/> <strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>Maybe it is — to use a
metaphor here — it’s a little bit like traffic congestion. If you add a
generator to the grid, it’s trying to ship its power through the grid,
and that decision to add your power mix to the grid combines with
everyone else that’s also generating and consuming power to drive
traffic jams or congestion in different parts of the grid, just like
your decision to hop in the car and drive to work or to go into the city
for the weekend to see a show or whatever you’re doing. It’s not just
your decision. It’s everyone’s combined decisions that affects travel
times on the grid.<br/> <br/> Now, the big difference between the grid
and travel on roads or most other forms of networks we’re used to is
that you don’t get to choose which path to go down. If you’re sending
electricity to the grid, electricity flows with physics down the path of
least resistance or impedance, which is the alternating current
equivalent of resistance. And so it’s a lot more like rivers flowing
downhill from gravity, right? You don’t get to choose which branch of
the river you go down. It’s just, you know, gravity will take you. And
so you adding your power flows to the grid creates complicated flows
based on the physics of this mesh network that spans a continent and
interacts with everyone else on the grid. <br/> <br/> And so when you’re
going from probably a few dozen large natural gas generators added that
operate very similarly to the plants that they’re replacing to hundreds
of gigawatts across thousands of projects scattered all over the grid
with very complicated generation profiles because they’re
weather-dependent renewables, it’s just a completely different challenge
for the utilities. <br/> <br/> So the process that the regional grid
operators developed in the 2000s, when they were restructuring and
taking over that role of regional grid operator, it’s just not fit for
purpose at all for what we face today. And I want to highlight another
thing you mentioned, which is the software piece of it, too. These
processes, they are using software and corporate processes that were
also developed 10 or 20 years ago. And we all know that software and
computing techniques have gotten quite a bit better over a decade or
two. And rarely have utilities and grid operators really kept pace with
those capabilities. <br/> <br/> <strong>Wayner: </strong>Can I just say,
I’ve heard that in some regions, interconnection consists of still
sending back and forth Excel files. To Tyler’s point earlier that we
only just now are getting data on the interconnection queue nationwide
and how it stands, that’s one challenge that developers are facing is a
lack of data transparency and rapid processing from the transmission
providers and the grid operators.<br/> <br/> And so, to use an analogy
that my colleague Sarah Toth uses a lot, which I really love: Imagine if
we had a Domino’s pizza tracker for the interconnection queue, and that
developers could just log on and see how their projects are doing in
many, if not most regions. They don’t even have that visibility. They
don’t know when their pizza is going to get delivered, or if it’s in the
oven.

<h2 id="top-takeaways-from-the-harris-trump-debate">Top takeaways from
the Harris-Trump debate</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald
Trump faced off on Tuesday night in Philadelphia in a debate that comes
less than two months before the presidential election.</p>
<p>The race is tight between the two candidates. Among registered
voters, Harris leads Trump by 1 point — 49% to 48% — according to the
latest PBS/NPR/Marist poll. That result falls within the margin of
error.</p>
<p>The ABC debate marks the first face-to-face meeting between Harris,
59, and Trump, 78.</p>
<p>A former prosecutor, Harris is the first woman, Black American and
South Asian American vice president. Trump, a businessman who has been
criticized for his sexist and racist remarks, is the first convicted
felon to run for president and, if elected, would be 82 by the end of
his term.</p>
<p>During what could be their only debate, Harris and Trump sparred on
issues ranging from the economy and immigration to democracy, abortion
and the Israel-Hamas war.</p>
<p>Here are some of the key takeaways from the debate.</p>
<p>Economy</p>
<p>The economy was the debate’s first topic, with Harris saying she
wants to create an “opportunity economy.” She cited her plan to increase
the tax credit for starting new small businesses from $5,000 to
$50,000.</p>
<p>“I am actually the only person on this stage who has a plan that is
about lifting up the middle class,” she said, adding that Trump wants to
help the rich with tax cuts.</p>
<p>Trump has said he will further reduce the corporate tax rate from the
current 21% to 15%. Harris wants to increase the rate to 28%. It was 35%
before Trump’s 2017 tax bill.</p>
<p>Trump spent much of his answer on the economy talking about
immigration. However, he also said he created one of the best economies
in the United States, without offering specifics, and that he will do it
again.</p>
<p>“Look, we’ve had a terrible economy, because inflation, which is
really known as a country buster,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Immigration</p>
<p>Immigration has been one of the biggest issues in this presidential
campaign. Throughout the debate, Trump lambasted the Biden
administration’s handling of immigration – often when the moderators
asked questions unrelated to immigration.</p>
<p>Trump repeated his false claims that immigrants are “taking over the
towns. They’re taking over buildings. They’re going in violently.” He
also cited baseless conspiracy theories about Haitian immigrants in Ohio
eating pet dogs and cats.</p>
<p>Harris criticized Trump for killing a bipartisan bill earlier this
year that would have put 1,500 more border agents on the U.S. southern
border. Harris has said she would support the bill.</p>
<p>Abortion</p>
<p>Trump and Harris grew increasingly combative when debating the
question of abortion.</p>
<p>As president, Trump appointed three justices to the U.S. Supreme
Court who helped form the majority that overturned the constitutional
right to abortion in 2022. That decision laid the groundwork for states
to impose restrictive rules on abortion around the country.</p>
<p>“The Supreme Court had great courage in doing it,” Trump said during
the debate.</p>
<p>When asked if he would support a national abortion ban, he said: “No,
I’m not in favor of abortion ban. But it doesn’t matter because this
issue has now been taken over by the states.”</p>
<p>He also said he would not oppose abortion in cases of rape, incest or
when the life of the mother is at risk. He also falsely claimed that
Democrats support abortions “after birth.”</p>
<p>In response, Harris emphasized the importance of women’s reproductive
rights.</p>
<p>“One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to
agree the government and Donald Trump certainly should not be telling a
woman what to do with her body,” she said. She added that she would
support Congress passing a bill to codify federal abortion protections
and, as president, sign it into law.</p>
<p>Rule of law, threats to democracy and Jan. 6</p>
<p>Harris was a prosecutor for a dozen years, first as San Francisco
district attorney and then as California’s attorney general. A central
component of Harris’ campaign has been portraying Trump as a threat to
democracy.</p>
<p>During the debate, Harris highlighted Trump’s status as a convicted
felon. Trump replied with the unsubstantiated accusation that Harris and
the Biden administration are “weaponizing” the government to prosecute
him</p>
<p>When asked by the moderator whether Trump would acknowledge that he
lost the 2020 presidential election, he replied with the false claim
that he actually won the election. On the Jan. 6 insurrection, Trump
said, “I had nothing to do with that, other than they asked me to make a
speech.”</p>
<p>“It’s time to turn the page,” Harris said.</p>
<p>“There is a place in our campaign for you to stand for our country,
to stand for democracy, to stand for rule of law and to end the chaos
and to end the approach that is about attacking the foundations of our
democracy,” she added.</p>
<p>Russia-Ukraine War and Israel-Hamas War</p>
<p>In addition to domestic policy, the moderators also pressed Harris
and Trump on foreign policy issues, including the ongoing wars between
Ukraine and Russia, and Israel and Hamas.</p>
<p>On the Israel-Hamas war, Harris said the United States would defend
Israel. She added that she supports a two-state solution. The war “must
end immediately, and the way it will end is we need a cease-fire deal,
and we need the hostages out,” Harris said.</p>
<p>Trump claimed that “Israel will be gone” if Harris becomes president,
which is unsubstantiated. Trump also repeated his claim that the Oct. 7
massacre by Hamas in southern Israel would have never happened if he
were president.</p>
<p>Trump said the Russia-Ukraine war would not have happened if he were
president. When asked if he wants Ukraine to win the war against Russia,
Trump would only say, “I want the war to stop.”</p>
<p>Harris replied: “If Donald Trump were president, Putin would be
sitting in Kyiv right now.”</p>

<h2 id="trumps-odd-attack-on-german-energy-policy">Trump’s Odd Attack on
German Energy Policy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-11, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzYxMjgzOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MjQyNDA0N30.Ys1fjb3PudXgX3YX4Oo0rOUYbe-55_LNbFmnFI-zqHQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
In the closing minutes of the first presidential debate tonight, Donald
Trump’s attacks on Kamala Harris took an odd, highly specific, and
highly Teutonic turn. It might not have made sense to many viewers, but
it fit into the overall debate’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-harris-debate-fracking" target="_self"><u>unusually
substantive focus</u></a> on energy policy.
</p>
<p>
“You believe in things that the American people don’t believe in,” he
said, addressing Harris. “You believe in things like, we’re not gonna
frack. We’re not gonna take fossil fuel. We’re not gonna do — things
that are going to make this country strong, whether you like it or not.”
</p>
<p>
“Germany tried that and within one year, they were back to building
normal energy plants,” he continued. “We’re not ready for it.”
</p>
<p>
What is he talking about? Let’s start by stipulating that Harris has
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-harris-debate-fracking" target="_self"><u>renounced</u></a>
her previous support for banning fracking. During the debate, she
bragged that the United States has hit an all-time high for oil and gas
production during her vice presidency.
</p>
<p>
But why bring Germany into it? At the risk of
<a href="https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/trump_incoherent_media_sanewashing.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>sane-washing</u></a>
the former president, Trump appears to be referencing what German
politicians call the
<a href="https://www.agora-energiewende.org/about-us/the-german-energiewende/q1-what-is-the-german-energiewende#:~:text=The%20German%20energy%20transition%2C%20known,neutral%20energy%20system%20by%202045." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Energiewiende</u></a>,
or <em><em>energy turnaround. </em></em>Since 2010, Germany has sought
to transition from its largest historic energy sources, including coal
and nuclear energy, to renewables and hydropower.
</p>
<p>
The Energiewiende is often discussed inside and outside of Germany as a
climate policy, and it has helped achieve global climate goals by, say,
<a href="https://www.howsolargotcheap.com/germany" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>helping
to push down</u></a> the global price of solar panels. But as an
observant reader might have already noticed, its goals are not
<em><em>entirely </em></em>emissions-related: Its leaders have also
hoped to use the Energiewiende to phase out nuclear power, which is
unpopular in Germany but which does not produce carbon emissions.
</p>
<p>
The transition has accomplished some of its goals: The country
<a href="https://www.bmwk.de/Redaktion/EN/Pressemitteilungen/2024/03/20240315-germany-on-track-for-2030-climate-targets-for-the-first-time.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>says</u></a>
that it is on target to meet its 2030 climate targets. But it ran into
trouble after Russia invaded Ukraine, because Germany
<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-did-germany-fare-without-russian-gas/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>obtained</u></a>
more than half of its natural gas, and much of its oil and coal besides,
from Russia. Germany turned back on some of its nuclear plants — it has
since shut them off again — and increased its coal consumption. It also
<a href="https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/germanys-dependence-imported-fossil-fuels" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>began
importing</u></a> fossil fuels from other countries.
</p>
<p>
In order to shore up its energy supply, Germany
<a href="https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/industry-slams-germanys-plans-h2-ready-gas-power-plants#:~:text=The%20government%20plans%20to%20put,that%20run%20with%20hydrogen%20only." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>is
also planning</u></a> to build 10 gigawatts of new natural gas plants by
2030, although it says that these facilities will be “hydrogen ready,”
meaning that they could theoretically run on the zero-carbon fuel
hydrogen. German automakers, who have lagged at building electric
vehicles,
<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/how-germany-e-fuel-push-save-combustion-engine-car/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>have
also pushed</u></a> for policies that support “e-fuels,” or low-carbon
liquid fuels. These fuels would — again, theoretically — allow German
firms to keep building internal combustion engines.
</p>
<p>
So perhaps that’s not exactly what Trump said, to put it mildly — but it
<em><em>is </em></em>true that to cope with the Ukraine war and the loss
of nuclear power, Germany has had to fall back on fossil fuels. Of
course, at the same time, more than 30% of German electricity
<a href="https://www.iea.org/countries/germany" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>now
comes from</u></a> wind and solar energy. In other words, in Germany,
renewables are just another kind of “normal energy plant.”

Would Trump Do About Climate Change? Something About the Mayor of

<p>
Well, it happened — over an hour into the debate, but it happened: the
presidential candidates were asked directly about climate change. ABC
News anchor Linsey Davis put the question to Vice President Kamala
Harris and former President Donald Trump, and their respective answers
were both surprising and totally not.
</p>
<p>
Harris responded to the question by laying out the successes of Biden’s
energy policy and in particular, the Inflation Reduction Act (though she
didn’t<strong> </strong>mention it by name). “I am proud that as vice
president, over the last four years, we have invested a trillion dollars
in a clean energy economy,” Harris noted.
</p>
<p>
The vice president immediately followed this up, however, by pointing
out that gas production has also increased to “historic levels,” under
the Biden-Harris administration. This framing, highlighting an
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/rnc-energy-all-of-the-above" target="_self"><u>all-of-the-above</u></a>
approach to energy, is consistent with Harris’s comments earlier in the
debate, when<strong> </strong>she claimed to support fracking and
investing in “diverse sources of energy.” Harris went on to reiterate
the biggest wins of the Inflation Reduction Act, namely, “800,000 new
manufacturing jobs,” and shouted out her endorsement from the United
Auto Workers and its President Shawn Fain.
</p>
<p>
Trump, who earlier in the debate called himself
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-solar-400-500-acres-of-desert-soil" target="_self"><u>“a
big fan of solar”</u></a> before questioning the amount of land it takes
up, started off his response by
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-bloodbath-chinese-evs" target="_self"><u>once
again claiming</u></a> that the Biden-Harris administration is building
Chinese-owned EV plants in Mexico (they are not). Then Trump veered
completely off topic and rounded out his answer by ranting about Biden
(both Joe and Hunter). “You know, Biden doesn’t go after people because,
supposedly, China paid him millions of dollars,” Trump noted. “He’s
afraid to do it between him and his son, they get all this money from
Ukraine.”
</p>
<p>
Trump’s answer included no reference to climate or clean energy — but it
did include a shout out to “the mayor of Moscow’s wife,” so there’s
that.

id="taylor-swift-endorses-kamala-harris-for-president-after-debate-ends">Taylor
Swift endorses Kamala Harris for president after debate ends</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Taylor Swift, one of the music industry’s biggest stars,
endorsed Kamala Harris for president shortly after the debate ended on
Tuesday night.</p>
<p>“I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can
accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not
chaos,” Swift wrote in an Instagram post, which included a link to a
voter registration website.</p>
<p>Swift has a dedicated following among young women, a key demographic
in the November election, and her latest tour has generated more than $1
billion in ticket sales. In a half hour, the post received more than 2.3
million likes.</p>
<p>She included a picture of herself holding her cat Benjamin Button,
and she signed the message “Childless Cat Lady.” The remark is a
reference to 3-year-old comments made by JD Vance, Donald Trump’s
running mate, about women without children not having an equal stake in
the country’s future.</p>
<p>A Harris senior campaign official said the endorsement was not
coordinated with the campaign. Tim Walz, Harris’ running mate, appeared
to learn about the endorsement in the middle of a live interview on
MSNBC. As Rachel Maddow read the text, Walz broke into a smile and
patted his chest.</p>
<p>“That was eloquent. And it was clear,” Walz said. “And that’s the
kind of courage we need in America to stand up.”</p>
<p>Swift wrote that her endorsement was partially prompted by Trump’s
decision to post AI-generated pictures suggesting that she had endorsed
him. One showed Swift dressed as Uncle Sam, and the text said, “Taylor
wants YOU to VOTE for DONALD TRUMP.”</p>
<p>Trump’s posts “brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very
transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter,” Swift
wrote. She added that “I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my
choice.”</p>
<p>The Trump campaign dismissed Swift’s endorsement.</p>
<p>“This is further evidence that the Democrat Party has unfortunately
become a party of the wealthy elites,” said spokesperson Karoline
Leavitt.</p>
<p>“There’s many Swifties for Trump out there in America,” she said,
herself included.</p>
<p>Swift’s endorsement was not exactly a surprise. In 2020, she
supported President Joe Biden, and she cheered for Harris in her debate
against then-Vice President Mike Pence. She also was openly critical of
Trump, saying he had stoked “the fires of white supremacy and
racism.”</p>
<p>Swift is a popular figure nationwide, but especially among Democrats.
An October 2023 Fox News poll found that 55% of voters overall,
including 68% of Democrats, said they had a favorable view of Swift.
Republicans were divided, with 43% having a favorable opinion and 45% an
unfavorable one.</p>
<p>AP VoteCast suggests that a partisan divide on Swift was apparent as
early as 2018. That’s the year Swift made her first political
endorsement, supporting Tennessee Democrat Phil Bredesen for Senate over
Republican Marsha Blackburn.</p>
<p>VoteCast found that among Tennessee voters that year, 55% of
Democrats and just 19% of Republicans said they had a favorable opinion
of Swift. Blackburn won by a comfortable margin in the deep red
state.</p>
<p>Swift is the leading nominee at Wednesday’s MTV Video Music Awards.
While it’s unclear whether Swift will attend the show in New York, she
could use any acceptance speeches to elaborate on her support of
Harris.</p>

Complains Solar Takes Up ‘400, 500 Acres of Desert Soil’</h2>

<p>
Former President Donald Trump has been
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-ev-pivot-elon-musk" target="_self"><u>warming
up</u></a> to the idea of electric vehicles in recent months, and he
used the debate podium on Tuesday night to announce that “I’m a big fan
of solar.” But don’t get <em><em>too</em></em> excited: He apparently
can’t
<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/oh-you-love-x-name-every-y" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>name
three of their albums</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
During a heated back-and-forth over Vice President Kamala Harris’ stance
on fracking, Trump started to get worked up about what will happen
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/evergreen-action-harris-plan" target="_self"><u>if
Democrats win the election</u></a>. “They’ll go back to destroying our
country and oil will be dead, fossil fuel will be dead,” he warned.
“We’ll go back to windmills and we’ll go back to solar, where they need
a whole desert to get some energy to come out. You ever see a solar
plant?”
</p>
<p>
Trump went on: “By the way, I’m a big fan of solar, but they take 400,
500 acres of desert soil.”
</p>
<p>
Trump has
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-intro" target="_self"><u>a
history of exaggeration</u></a>, but this is neither particularly
hyperbolic nor as concerning as Trump would have you believe. About
34,000 acres of public land are currently devoted to solar energy, and a
common estimate is that the U.S. would need to expand solar to an
additional 700,000 acres to meet 2035 renewable energy goals. That’s
about 1,100 square miles, or 1,555 Trump-sized solar farms (or 0.031115%
of the entire United States,
<a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2024/01/24/no-the-us-is-not-going-to-cover-22-million-acres-with-solar-panels/amp/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>per
</u><u><em><em>Clean Technica</em></em></u></a>).
</p>
<p>
And while it’s true that
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=38272" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>most</u></a>
utility-scale solar photovoltaic facilities are only a handful of acres,
it only takes
<a href="https://seia.org/initiatives/land-use-solar-development/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>about
five to seven acres</u></a> to generate a megawatt — so a project of
Trump’s reckoning would generate about 65 megawatts, which, as Mads
Rønne Almassalkhi, an associate professor of electrical and biomedical
engineering at the University of Vermont, pointed out, isn’t all that
shabby:

<p class="drop-caps">
About 40 minutes into the first (and perhaps only) debate between Donald
Trump and Kamala Harris, the vice president was asked about her changing
stances on a variety of issues since her ill-fated 2019 run for
president — in particular, her previous vow to ban fracking.
</p>
<p>
Debating in Pennsylvania, the nation’s second-largest natural gas
producer, Harris stated that she no longer supports this ban. “I have
not banned fracking as vice president of the United States, and in fact,
I was the tie-breaking vote on the Inflation Reduction Act, which opened
new leases for fracking,” she said, much as she
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/harris-campaign-pennsylvania-fracking" target="_self"><u>put
it on CNN</u></a> recently. She went on, though: “My position is that we
have got to invest in diverse sources of energy so we reduce our
reliance on foreign oil,” Harris said. “We have had the largest increase
in domestic oil production in history because of an approach that
recognizes that we cannot rely on foreign oil.”
</p>
<p>
The Harris campaign capitalized on this moment to post
<a href="https://x.com/KamalaHQ/status/1833685174623551737" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
chart on X</u></a> showing the increase in average monthly energy
production under the Biden administration compared to Trump’s, citing
data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

<script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
</center>
<p>
Trump wasn’t buying Harris’ about-face, though, claiming Harris will
“never allow fracking in Pennsylvania.” He went on to say that when
Democrats took over in 2020, they tried to “get rid” of oil production,
tying this to the increase in gasoline prices.
</p>
<p>
The U.S. has been the world’s largest producer of natural gas since 2011
and the largest producer of petroleum since 2018. Biden’s presidency has
seen a boom in all types of U.S. energy production, including
renewables.
</p>
<p>
Since Harris joined the Biden ticket 2020, she has distanced herself
from her previous stance on fracking, particularly her comment in a 2019
CNN town hall that “there’s no question I’m in favor of banning
fracking.”
</p>
<p>
Much of the increase in oil prices during the Biden administration came
from supply chain disruptions in the wake of Covid, when demand and thus
production plummeted, as well as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which
caused a
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=55020" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>price
spike</u></a> as Biden banned imports of Russian oil and natural gas.
(Oil prices currently are near a
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/oil-steady-supply-disruptions-storm-francine-offset-weak-demand-2024-09-10/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>three-year
low</u></a>.) Harris is correct that the IRA did indeed open up new
leases for fossil fuels — the law now requires the government to hold
auctions for millions of acres of onshore and offshore oil and gas
leases prior to opening auctions for renewables. Joe Manchin, the
senator from West Virginia and the deciding vote on the IRA, has even
boasted that the legislation has allowed the U.S. to
<a href="https://www.manchin.senate.gov/newsroom/op-eds/because-of-the-ira-we-are-producing-fossil-fuels-at-record-levels" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>produce
fossil fuels at record levels</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Whether or not this is something to brag about is something Democrats
will have to decide amongst themselves. But for the purpose of this
debate, Harris hopes it’s enough to assure swing state voters that she’s
no climate absolutist — and that, as of now at least, oil and fossil
fuels are far from dead.

id="china-takes-lead-in-critical-technology-research-after-switching-places-with-us">China
takes lead in critical technology research after ‘switching places’ with
US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SINGAPORE — An Australian think tank that tracks tech competitiveness
says China is now the world leader in research on almost 90% of critical
technologies. In a newly released report, the research group adds there
is also a high risk of Beijing securing a monopoly on defense-related
tech, including drones, satellites and collaborative robots — those that
can work safely alongside humans.</p>
<p>Analysts say the huge leap forward for China is the result of heavy
state investment over the past two decades. They add that despite the
progress, Beijing is still dependent on other countries for key tech
components and lacks self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>The report from the government-funded Australian Strategic Policy
Institute, or ASPI, released last Thursday, says China led the way in
research into 57 out of 64 advanced technologies in the five years from
2019-2023.</p>
<p>ASPI’s Critical Technology Tracker ranks countries’ innovation
capabilities based on the number of appearances in the top 10% of
research papers. It focuses on crucial technologies from a range of
fields including artificial intelligence, biotechnology, cyber and
defense.</p>
<p>The report found that “China and the United States have effectively
switched places as the overwhelming leader in research in just two
decades.”</p>
<p>China led in only three of the 64 technologies between 2003 and 2007
but has shot up in the rankings, replacing the U.S., which is now a
frontrunner in just seven critical technologies.</p>
<p>Josh Kennedy-White is a technology strategist based in Singapore. He
says China’s huge leap is a “direct result of its aggressive,
state-driven research and development investments over the past two
decades.”</p>
<p>He adds that the shift toward China is “particularly stark in fields
like artificial intelligence, quantum computing and advanced aircraft
engines, where China has transitioned from a laggard to a leader in a
relatively short period.”</p>
<p>ASPI also determines the risk of countries holding a monopoly on the
research of critical technologies. They currently classify 24
technologies as “high risk” of being monopolized — all by Beijing.</p>
<p>Ten technologies are newly classified as “high risk” this year, with
many of them linked to the defense industry.</p>
<p>“The potential monopoly risk in 24 technology areas, especially those
in defense-related fields like radars and drones, is concerning in the
current and future geopolitical context,” Tobias Feakin, founder of
consultancy firm Protostar Strategy, told VOA.</p>
<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has sought to boost his country’s
advanced manufacturing capabilities with the ambitious “Made in China
2025” initiative.</p>
<p>The policy, launched in 2015, aims to strengthen Beijing’s
self-reliance in critical sectors and make China a global tech
powerhouse.</p>
<p>Xi, according to Feakin, views advanced technologies as “strategic
priorities for China’s development, national security and global
competitiveness.”</p>
<p>He adds that technologies are seen as a “central component of China’s
long-term economic and geopolitical goals.”</p>
<p>Beijing’s ambitions are being closely watched in Washington, with the
Biden administration working to limit China’s access to advanced
technology.</p>
<p>Last week, the U.S. introduced new export controls on critical
technology to China, including chip-making equipment and quantum
computers and components.</p>
<p>That announcement came shortly after U.S. national security adviser
Jake Sullivan made his first ever visit to Beijing. He met with Xi and
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.</p>
<p>Sullivan told reporters that Washington “will continue to take
necessary action to prevent advanced U.S. technologies from being used
to undermine national security.”</p>
<p>The continued efforts to curb China’s chip industry mean that Beijing
must look further afield for advanced technology.</p>
<p>“Even though it leads in areas like artificial intelligence and 5G,
China still depends on Taiwan, the U.S. and South Korea to produce
high-end semiconductors”, Kennedy-White told VOA.</p>
<p>Describing this as China’s Achilles’ heel, Kennedy-White says the
lack of self-sufficiency in the semiconductor industry could “stunt
Beijing’s progress in artificial intelligence, quantum computing and
military applications.”</p>
<p>As China continues its dominance in critical technology research,
questions have been raised over exactly how the country is making these
breakthroughs.</p>
<p>Last October, officials from the Five Eyes intelligence alliance
(Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United
States) issued a joint statement accusing China of stealing intellectual
property. U.S. FBI director Christopher Wray described it as an
“unprecedented threat.”</p>
<p>Kennedy-White, managing director of Singapore-based venture catalyst
firm DivisionX Global, agrees with this assessment. He says China’s jump
up the ASPI rankings is “not entirely organic.”</p>
<p>“There is a correlation between China’s rise in certain technologies
and allegations of intellectual property theft,” he added.</p>
<p>ASPI also recommends ways for other countries to close the gap on
China. It advises the AUKUS alliance of Australia, the U.K. and the U.S.
to join forces with Japan and South Korea to try to catch up.</p>
<p>The report also highlights the emergence of India as a “key center”
of global research innovation and excellence.</p>
<p>The South Asian nation now ranks in the top five countries for 45 out
of the 64 technologies that are tracked by ASPI. It’s a huge gain
compared with 2003-2007, when India sat in the top five for only four
technologies.</p>
<p>Feakin says countries across the Asia-Pacific “will benefit from
leveraging India’s growing technology expertise and influence.”</p>
<p>It will also provide a counterbalance to “overdependence on China’s
technology supply chain,” he added.</p>

bestows highest honor on 13 troops killed during Afghanistan
withdrawal</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — House Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday presented
Congress’ highest honor — the Congressional Gold Medal — to 13 U.S.
service members who were killed during the disastrous withdrawal from
Afghanistan, even as the politics of a presidential election swirled
around the event.</p>
<p>Both Democrats and Republicans supported the legislation to
posthumously honor the 13 U.S. troops, who were killed along with more
than 170 Afghans in a suicide bombing at the Abbey Gate at Kabul’s
airport in August 2021. President Joe Biden signed the legislation in
December 2021. On Tuesday, the top Republican and Democratic leaders for
both the House and Senate spoke at a somber ceremony in the Capitol
Rotunda, hailing the lives and sacrifices of the service members.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called on the lawmakers gathered
to “ensure the sacrifices of all our servicemembers were not in
vain.”</p>
<p>“We must care for them and their families and defend the values of
freedom and democracy they so nobly fought for,” said Schumer, a New
York Democrat.</p>
<p>But rather than a unifying moment, the event took place against the
backdrop of a bitter back-and-forth over who is to blame for the rushed
and deadly evacuation from Kabul. Johnson, a Louisiana Republican and
ally of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, scheduled the
ceremony just hours before the first debate between Trump and Democrat
Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>“They lost their lives because of this administration’s catastrophic
withdrawal from Afghanistan,” Johnson said at a news conference minutes
before the ceremony.</p>
<p>Then as the speaker opened the ceremony, he took another jab at how
the Biden administration has defended its handling of the final months
of America’s longest war.</p>
<p>“To the families who are here, I know many of you have yet to hear
these words, so I will say them: we are sorry,” Johnson said. “The
United States government should have done everything to protect our
troops, those fallen and wounded at Abbey Gate deserved our best
efforts, and the families who have been left to pick up the pieces
continue to deserve transparency, appreciation and recognition.”</p>
<p>Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee also released a
scathing investigation on Sunday into the withdrawal that cast blame on
Biden’s administration and minimized the role of Trump, who had signed
the withdrawal deal with the Taliban.</p>
<p>White House national security spokesperson John Kirby on Monday
criticized the House report as partisan and one-sided and said it
revealed little new information and contained several inaccuracies. He
noted that evacuation plans had started well before the pullout, and the
fall of Kabul “moved a lot faster than anyone could have
anticipated.”</p>
<p>He also acknowledged that during the evacuation “not everything went
according to plan. Nothing ever does.”</p>
<p>“We hold ourselves all accountable for that,” he said of the
deaths.</p>
<p>Top military and White House officials attended the ceremony Tuesday,
including Secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough and Air Force
Gen. Charles Q. Brown, Jr. the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff.</p>
<p>Pentagon reviews have concluded that the suicide bombing was not
preventable and suggestions troops may have seen the would-be bomber
were not true.</p>
<p>Regardless, Trump has thrust the withdrawal, with the backing from
some of the families of the Americans killed, into the center of his
campaign. Last month, his political team distributed video of him
attending a wreath-laying ceremony for the fallen service members at
Arlington National Cemetery on the third anniversary of the bombing,
despite the cemetery’s prohibition on partisan activity on the grounds
as well as an altercation with a cemetery employee who was trying to
make sure the campaign followed those rules.</p>
<p>Most assessments have concluded Trump and Biden share blame for the
disastrous end to the 20-year war, which saw enemy Taliban take over
Afghanistan again before the last American troops even flew out of the
Kabul airport. Over 2,000 U.S. troops were killed in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The main U.S. government watchdog for the war points to Trump’s 2020
deal with the Taliban to withdraw all U.S. forces and military
contractors as “the single most important factor” in the collapse of
U.S.-allied Afghan security forces and Taliban takeover. Biden’s April
2021 announcement that he would proceed with the withdrawal set in
motion by Trump was the second-biggest factor, the watchdog said.</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>Not too long ago, Mozilla announced it was going to extend its
support for Windows 7, and was mulling over extending support for
Windows 8.x as well, without providing any time frames or details. Well,
we’ve got the details now. According to the Firefox Release Calendar
website, Firefox 115 ESR, the latest Firefox version with support for
Windows 7, 8, and 8.1, will continue receiving updates until April 1,
2025. Firefox 115.21 ESR is expected on March 4, 2024, which means users
with old Windows versions have at least seven more months of support
from Firefox. ↫ Taras Buria at Neowin The same extension to March 2025
for Firefox 115 ESR also covers macOS 10.12-10.14. The reasoning behind
the extension is simple: there’s still enough users on these older
operating system version for Mozilla to dedicate resources to it,
despite how difficult backporting security fixes to 115 ESR has become.
Firefox is pretty much the only mainstream browser still supporting
Windows 7 and 8, and that’s definitely commendable.</p>

id="house-speaker-pushes-funding-bill-that-includes-proof-of-citizenship-mandate">House
speaker pushes funding bill that includes proof of citizenship
mandate</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — House Speaker Mike Johnson vowed Tuesday to press ahead
with requiring proof of citizenship for new voters as part of a bill to
avoid a partial government shutdown in three weeks, though the measure
appeared likely to be voted down. </p>
<p>Democrats overwhelmingly oppose the measure. Enough Republicans were
also coming out against the bill, though for different reasons, that its
prospects of passing the House appeared dim. Even if it does pass the
House on Wednesday, the bill would go nowhere in the Senate. </p>
<p>Johnson said the issue of election security is too critical to
ignore, though research has shown that voting by non-citizens is
extremely rare. It’s also clear that Republicans see value in making
House Democrats take another vote on the issue. The House approved a
bill with the proof of citizenship mandate back in July </p>
<p>“If you have a few thousand illegals participate in the election in
the wrong place, you can change the makeup of Congress and you can
affect the presidential election,” Johnson said. “The American people
understand that.” </p>
<p>The first test for the stopgap spending bill came Tuesday with a
209-206 vote that kept it moving ahead. But some Republicans who have
said they will oppose the bill on final passage allowed it to
proceed. </p>
<p>The measure includes a six-month extension of federal funding to keep
agencies and programs operating through March 28. </p>
<p>But Democrats want a shorter-term extension so that the current
Congress will set full-year spending levels for fiscal 2025 rather than
the next president and Congress. They also want the proof of citizenship
mandate stripped out of the bill, saying it’s unnecessary because states
already have effective safeguards in place to verify voters’ eligibility
and maintain accurate voter rolls. </p>
<p>“Is it any surprise that the speaker’s purely partisan CR seems to be
running into trouble?” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, using
Washington parlance for the short-term continuing resolution needed to
prevent a shutdown. “The answer is very simple. The House should stop
wasting time on a CR proposal that cannot become law.” </p>
<p>Schumer called on Johnson to consult with Democratic leaders and the
White House on a bipartisan package that can pass both chambers. </p>
<p>A few House Republicans have also come out against the bill. Some
won’t vote for any continuing resolution. They want Congress to return
to passing the dozen annual appropriations bills individually. Others
say the continuing resolution funds programs at levels they consider
inappropriate at a time of nearly $2 trillion annual deficits. </p>
<p>“I’m a firm no on bankrupting the nation and a yes on election
integrity,” said Representative Cory Mills in announcing his
opposition. </p>
<p>Representative Tim Burchett said Republican leadership was asking him
to vote for what he called “a Nancy Pelosi-Schumer budget.” </p>
<p>“I just think that’s a bad idea,” Burchett said. </p>
<p>Republicans can afford to lose only four votes from their ranks if
every Democrat votes against the bill. </p>
<p>Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Tuesday seemingly
encouraged a government shutdown if Republicans in the House and Senate
“don’t get assurances on Election Security.” He said on the social media
platform Truth Social that they should not go forward with a continuing
resolution without such assurances. </p>
<p>Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell disagreed when asked about
Trump’s post. </p>
<p>“Shutting down the government is always a bad idea, no matter what
time of the year it is,” McConnell said. </p>
<p>House Republicans met behind closed doors Tuesday morning to discuss
the path forward. Representative Jim Jordan, a co-founder of the
conservative House Freedom Caucus, told colleagues “this is the best
fight we’ve ever had,” said Representative Kevin Hern.</p>
<p>By holding another vote on the proof of citizenship requirement for
voter registration, House Republicans are making Democrats in
competitive swing districts take another vote on the issue ahead of the
election. Last time, five Democrats sided with Republicans in support of
the requirement. And their votes this time will be highly
scrutinized. </p>
<p>Lawmakers said no plan B was discussed for government funding and
that Johnson was determined to hold a vote regardless of the likely
outcome. </p>
<p>“This is important to him,” said Representative Ralph Norman. “This

<h2 id="announcing-e-maj-4.5.0.">Announcing E-Maj 4.5.0.</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-11, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
We are very glad to announce the <strong>4.5.0</strong> version of
<strong>E-Maj</strong>.
</p>
<p>
E-Maj is a PostgreSQL extension which enables fine-grained write logging
and time travel on subsets of the database.
</p>
<p>
This version brings the PostgreSQL 17 version compatibility. The emaj
extension installation and uninstallation have been enhanced (Many
thanks to David Wheeler for his valuable help on this topic). Aside a
few bug fixes, it is now possible to monitor the changes recording
activity with a new CLI command, emajStat.pl, and a new “Activity” page
in the Emaj_web client.
</p>
<p>
E-Maj 4.5.0 is compatible with Postgres 11 to 17 versions.
</p>
<p>
The full <a href="http://emaj.readthedocs.io">documentation</a> is
available on line. The core extension is available at
<a href="http://http://pgxn.org/dist/e-maj/">pgxn.org</a> for
installation or <a>github.org</a> for development.
</p>
<p>
The <strong>Emaj_web</strong> client is also available at
<a href="https://github.com/dalibo/emaj_web">github.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
Have fun with E-Maj !
