## Excerpts from The Believer: Ask Carrie

date: 2025-01-31, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://edge.mcsw.net/mcsweeneys/ww9rc6qt54npwimr3egxdglf6hfj" alt="" /></p> <h2>A quarterly column from Carrie Brownstein, who is better at dispensing advice than taking it.</h2> <p><span class="dropcap">Q:</span> <i>What is an appropriate amount of time to stay at your friend’s art show if you’re not interested in the social aspect of that kind of thing? I’m all about showing up to support people, but I find the conversations at these events so tedious and performative. And I hate who these events make me become: I find myself trying to fit in, while also judging my friends, who are all of a sudden talking differently and putting on airs. Should I just suffer through them?</i></p> <p><i>JD<br /> Los Angeles, CA</i></p> <p><span class="dropcap">A:</span> I went to college in a small town where we had to make our own fun. Lots of what we did was reimagine and emulate big-city functions like art openings, musicals, and fashion shows. Our events were scrappy, shambolic, and wonderful. They worked because we intentionally aimed for gilded and saw no value in actual gold. But when there’s a lack of self-awareness, these gatherings can feel performative and contrived. That being said, I now live in a medium-sized city, and the last time I attended one of these events, and felt my skin begin to crawl when confronted with a mid-Atlantic accent and Truman Capote cosplay, I started to think that maybe everyone—even in New York or Paris or London—is simply acting out an idea of what it means to be a partygoer or an art aficionado or an intellectual. So what is the appropriate amount of time to stay at your friend’s art show? However long you can stand to pretend along with the other fakers.</p> <div class='break'>- - -</div><p><span class="dropcap">Q:</span> <i>I’ve gone on a number of art museum dates, but I’m not sure how good of an idea they are. They’re starting to feel like screening tests that invariably detect a problem. On one occasion, I was with someone I seemed to have a lot in common with, but we ended up clashing over most of the canvases—he saw laziness where I saw fleeting beauty; he saw bold defiance where I saw petulant rebellion. It got so tense that we ended up leaving early.</p> <p>Another time, my date paused at nearly every painting to say something like “This painting is so me!” She projected herself onto everything, from portraits to landscapes, relating each one back to herself. Her constant self-comparison gave me the ick, and I decided to call things off.</p> <p>These experiences have me wondering if the art museum brings out the worst in my dates, or in me. Should I stop taking future dates there, or is this actually a good way to gauge someone’s character?</i></p> <p><i>Jess<br /> Chicago, IL</i></p> <p><span class="dropcap">A:</span> Clashing over art should not be a deal-breaker, as long as there is mutual respect in both delivery and intent, a willingness to entertain opposing views, and perhaps the concession that a right or wrong interpretation is beside the point. On the other hand, “This painting is so me!” is an absolute deal-breaker and your reaction was entirely appropriate. (At the very least, you’ve spared yourself from ever having to hear the words, “This breakup is so me!”)</p> <p>As to your question, I do wonder if museum-going is best left for further along in a potential relationship. While gently sparring over a painting or sculpture can be stimulating, it can be irksome too. Also irritating, I would think, is the constant affirmation and parroting of our own views. Plus, you need to be wary of the mutual desire to establish common interests early on, often while obfuscating more nuanced or even contrary predilections. And while you posit museum-going as a test of character, perhaps you’re simply struggling with the age-old quandary of whether opposites attract or if shared interests prevail. Or, to be less trite, maybe you deem yourself someone with good taste and are thus looking for someone else with good (i.e., your own) taste. No shame there! I probably wouldn’t date anyone who’d never heard of Poly Styrene or Elaine May.</p> <p>So might I suggest a deeper examination of what you’re looking for when you say “character.” My hunch is you could replace “museum” with just about any context, and face the same conundrum: finding a romantic partner, someone who really sees you and loves you for who you are, is really, really hard. It’s often easier to look for faults and reasons not to try. Therefore, maybe gauging good character is less about how a date responds to David Wojnarowicz and more about how vulnerable, silly, sexy, gross, smart, and just plain stupid you can be with someone, and finding someone who can be those same things around you. No judgment, no ridicule. A person you can trust not only with your excellent taste in culture, but with your heart. If art matters to you, witness it with someone who matters to you as well. Sigh. This answer is so me! (I’ll show myself out.)</p> <div class='break'>- - -</div><p style="text-align:center;"><i><strong><a href="https://www.thebeliever.net/ask-carrie-winter-2024/">Read the rest of Carrie&#8217;s advice over at The Believer.</a></strong></i></p>

## An Oral History of the Kidz Bop Cover of John Cage’s 4′33″

date: 2025-01-31, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<h4>Part One: The Kidz</h4> <p><strong>Dana Wilkinson, <i>Kidz Bop Producer</i>:</strong> People don’t remember this, but there was a draft in the early 2000s. We’d show up at some third-grader’s door, and they could only bring one duffle bag and a handful of their homeland’s soil with them. We called them the Kidz Korp.</p> <p><strong>Eileen Atwater, <i>Kidz Bop Kid</i>:</strong> The Kidz Korp was run by Irving “Big Irv” Schopenhauer, who was a studio exec from the 1940s.</p> <p><strong>Harry Collins, <i>Kidz Bop Kid</i>:</strong> Big Irv was strict but fair. We could only eat cat food and cigarettes, but we could have all the cat food and cigarettes we wanted.</p> <p><strong>Mike “Fancy Feast” Lewis, <i>Kidz Bop Kid</i> [<i>archival interview</i>]:</strong> We all ate the cat food. I don’t know why I’m the only one who got the nickname Fancy Feast… I’ll die a happy man if no one ever calls me Fancy Feast again.</p> <p>[<i>Ed. note: Mike “Fancy Feast” Lewis was killed in 2014 when his tanning bed fused shut and burst into flames.</i>]</p> <p><strong>Harry Collins:</strong> Fancy Feast said that? Crazy.</p> <h4>Part Two: The Piece</h4> <p><strong>Eileen Atwater:</strong> The whole idea behind John Cage’s <i>4′33″</i> was that the sounds of everyday life were just as interesting and engaging as those in a traditional piece of classical music.</p> <p><strong>Harry Collins:</strong> He wanted you to listen to the sounds you usually ignore. Like people breathing and birds chirping. I wasn’t all that excited about it, but they kept telling us that if we didn’t do what they said, they’d sell us to Randy Quaid, and he’d hunt us for sport. So yeah, we fell in line.</p> <p><strong>Harvey Roth:</strong> We were all terrified of Randy Quaid. The only movie they let us watch was <i>Caddyshack II</i>.</p> <p><strong>Irving “Big Irv” Schopenhauer [<i>archival interview</i>]:</strong> Well, ah, in the original piece, it’s mostly people fidgeting and coughing and stuff. It wasn’t very kid-oriented. So we thought, why not get a clown and let him do this thing? Then, we’ll get audio of the kids in the audience reacting.</p> <h4>Part Three: Showtime</h4> <p><strong>Dana Wilkinson:</strong> I don’t know where they found that fucking clown. I think they paid him in cough syrup.</p> <p><i>When the piece begins, the first sounds you can hear are some tentative giggles. Then, about forty-five seconds in, you hear Eileen Atwater’s distinctive gasp.</i></p> <p><strong>Eileen Atwater:</strong> People still recognize me, “Oh, are you the little girl who gasps in <i>4′33″</i>?” What they don’t know is that I gasped because the clown was trying to balance on a skateboard while holding two lit torches, and I guess I was the only one who saw it coming.</p> <p><strong>Harry Collins:</strong> The clown was juggling fire. We all knew that was [record executive] Al Hirschfield’s idea, because Al Hirschfield had a saying: “If a little fire is good, a lot of fire must be great!” Poor guy. No one ever explained fire to him, I guess.</p> <p><strong>Dana Wilkinson:</strong> Al Hirschfield? He was killed in 2014 when his tanning bed fused shut and burst into flames.</p> <p><i>In a cough-syrup-induced haze, the clown drops one of the torches. The curtains immediately ignite. That’s when the kids start screaming.</i></p> <p><strong>Mike “Fancy Feast” Lewis [<i>archival interview</i>]:</strong> The first wave of screams is playful, like maybe it was all planned. I don’t know; I was six, and I hadn’t slept in three months. I was hallucinating that my blood was alive and trying to escape out of my feet. I later found out I had mercury poisoning from all the cat food we were eating.</p> <p><strong>Dana Wilkinson:</strong> The curtains went up in flames, and the kids were stampeding toward the exit. I tried to throw some of the cat litter from the kids’ litter boxes on the clown, but I think he was already dead by that point.</p> <p><strong>Al Hirschfield [<i>archival interview</i>]:</strong> The only people who didn’t flee were me and Big Irv. He just kept screaming, “Keep rolling! Keep rolling!” That’s mostly what you hear in the finished recording: him yelling and me chanting the Mourner’s Kaddish for the clown.</p> <p><strong>Dana Wilkinson:</strong> Listen, if you’re gonna cry about every clown that dies during a Kidz Bop recording session, you’ll never get anything done. I learned that on my first day on the job.</p> <h4>Part Four: The Legacy</h4> <p><strong>Eileen Atwater:</strong> It’s nice that it’s had such an impact over the years.</p> <p><strong>Harry Collins:</strong> People come up to me all the time and are like, &#8220;Is it true you watched a clown burn to death, and they recorded it for a Kidz Bop album?&#8221; No one ever believes that to us, it was just another Tuesday.</p> <p><strong>Mike “Fancy Feast” Lewis [<i>archival interview</i>]:</strong> I can’t listen to it anymore. It just makes me crave cat food.</p> <p><i>Editor’s Note: </i>4′33″<i> composer John Cage passed away in 1992 when his tanning bed fused shut and burst into flames. His estate has formally denounced the Kidz Korp.</i></p>

## The surprising way to save memory with BytesIO

date: 2025-01-31, updated: 2025-01-31, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://pythonspeed.com/articles/bytesio-reduce-memory-usage/">The surprising way to save memory with BytesIO</a></strong></p>
Itamar Turner-Trauring explains that if you have a <code>BytesIO</code> object in Python calling <code>.read()</code> on it will create a full copy of that object, doubling the amount of memory used - but calling <code>.getvalue()</code> returns a <code>bytes</code> object that uses no additional memory, instead using copy-on-write.</p>
<p><code>.getbuffer()</code> is another memory-efficient option but it returns a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#memoryview">memoryview</a> which has less methods than the <code>bytes</code> you get back from <code>.getvalue()</code>- it doesn't have <code>.find()</code> for example.

## Quoting Ashlee Vance

<blockquote cite="https://www.corememory.com/p/a-young-man-used-ai-to-build-a-nuclear"><p>Eventually, however, HudZah wore Claude down. He filled his Project with the e-mail conversations he’d been having with fusor hobbyists, parts lists for things he’d bought off Amazon, spreadsheets, sections of books and diagrams. HudZah also changed his questions to Claude from general ones to more specific ones.

## SLAP and FLOP Side-Channel Attacks

date: 2025-01-30, from: Michael Tsai

Jason Kim et al. (Hacker News, MacRumors, Slashdot): We present SLAP, a new speculative execution attack that arises from optimizing data dependencies, as opposed to control flow dependencies. More specifically, we show that Apple CPUs starting with the M2/A15 are equipped with a Load Address Predictor (LAP), which improves performance by guessing the next memory [&#8230;]

## Repeating Calculator Operations

date: 2025-01-30, from: Michael Tsai

Juli Clover: When you tap the equals sign twice, the app will now repeat the last mathematical operation. [&#8230;] Repeating operations were an option in the Calculator app prior to iOS 18, but iOS 18 removed the functionality. I wonder what the story is here. This has been a standard feature of every physical calculator [&#8230;]

## Forgotten Literary Moments in Which a Cat Throws up and No One Wants to Deal With It

date: 2025-01-30, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<h4><i>The Great Gatsby</i>, <br /> by F. Scott Fitzgerald</h4> <p>They were careless people, Tom and Daisy&#8212;they bought regular kibble, even when specifically asked to get hairball control, and then retreated into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together and let other people clean up the mess that Mr. Fancybiscuits had made. When confronted, they only said, “Isn’t this why we have servants?”</p> <div class='break'>- - -</div><h4><i>Macbeth</i><br /> by William Shakespeare</h4> <p><span class="caps">LADY</span> <span class="caps">MACBETH</span><br /> Out, damned spot, out, I say!

Much like other things I could mention.&#8221;</p> <p>The car slowed, suddenly pressing Brett against me. Inside his carrier, Tiger groaned like a dying bull.</p> <p>“He eats too fast,” Brett said. “The vet recommended a special food bowl that would make him slow down.

We shall live through the long procession of chunks before us and through the long retchings; we shall patiently bear the spew that fate imposes on us; we shall scrub it without rest; and when our last hour comes, we shall meet it humbly, and there, beyond the grave, we shall say that we have suffered and wept, that our life, like little Fluffsky’s bile, was bitter, and God will pity us. Ah, then dear, dear Uncle, we shall look back upon all that was regurgitated here—and—we shall rest. (<i><span class="caps">SONIA</span> kneels before her uncle. She speaks in a weary voice</i>.)

## PyPI now supports project archival

date: 2025-01-30, updated: 2025-01-30, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2025-01-30-archival/">PyPI now supports project archival</a></strong></p>
Neat new PyPI feature, similar to GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/archiving-repositories">archiving repositories</a> feature. You can now mark a PyPI project as "archived", making it clear that no new releases are planned (though you can switch back out of that mode later if you need to).</p>
<p>I like the sound of these future plans around this topic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Project archival is the first step in a larger project, aimed at improving the <em>lifecycle</em> of projects on PyPI. That project includes evaluating additional project statuses (things like "deprecated" and "unmaintained"), as well as changes to <a href="https://docs.pypi.org/api/">PyPI's public APIs</a> that will enable clients to retrieve and act on project status information. You can track our progress on these fronts by following along with <a href="https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/issues/16844">warehouse#16844</a>!</p>
</blockquote>

## Mistral Small 3

date: 2025-01-30, updated: 2025-01-30, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-small-3/">Mistral Small 3</a></strong></p>
First model release of 2025 for French AI lab Mistral, who describe Mistral Small 3 as "a latency-optimized 24B-parameter model released under the Apache 2.0 license."</p>
<p>More notably, they claim the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mistral Small 3 is competitive with larger models such as Llama 3.3 70B or Qwen 32B, and is an excellent open replacement for opaque proprietary models like GPT4o-mini. Mistral Small 3 is on par with Llama 3.3 70B instruct, while being more than 3x faster on the same hardware.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Llama 3.3 70B and Qwen 32B are two of my favourite models to run on my laptop - that ~20GB size turns out to be a great trade-off between memory usage and model utility. It's exciting to see a new entrant into that weight class.</p>
<p>The license is important: previous Mistral Small models used their Mistral Research License, which prohibited commercial deployments unless you negotiate a commercial license with them. They appear to be moving away from that, at least for their core models:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We’re renewing our commitment to using Apache 2.0 license for our general purpose models, as we progressively move away from MRL-licensed models</strong>. As with Mistral Small 3, model weights will be available to download and deploy locally, and free to modify and use in any capacity. […] Enterprises and developers that need specialized capabilities (increased speed and context, domain specific knowledge, task-specific models like code completion) can count on additional commercial models complementing what we contribute to the community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite being called Mistral Small 3, this appears to be the fourth release of a model under that label. The Mistral API calls this one <code>mistral-small-2501</code> - previous model IDs were <code>mistral-small-2312</code>, <code>mistral-small-2402</code> and <code>mistral-small-2409</code>.</p>
<p>I've <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mistral/releases/tag/0.10">updated the llm-mistral plugin</a> for talking directly to Mistral's <a href="https://docs.mistral.ai/deployment/laplateforme/overview/">La Plateforme</a> API:</p>
<pre><code>llm install -U llm-mistral
llm keys set mistral
# Paste key here
llm -m mistral/mistral-small-latest "tell me a joke about a badger and a puffin"
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Sure, here's a light-hearted joke for you:</p>
<p>Why did the badger bring a puffin to the party?</p>
<p>Because he heard puffins make great party 'Puffins'!</p>
<p>(That's a play on the word "puffins" and the phrase "party people.")</p>
</blockquote>
<p>API pricing is $0.10/million tokens of input, $0.30/million tokens of output - half the price of the previous Mistral Small API model ($0.20/$0.60). for comparison, GPT-4o mini is $0.15/$0.60.</p>
<p>Mistral also ensured that the new model was <a href="https://ollama.com/library/mistral-small">available on Ollama</a> in time for their release announcement.</p>
<p>You can pull the model like this (fetching 14GB):</p>
<pre><code>ollama run mistral-small:24b
</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/taketwo/llm-ollama">llm-ollama</a> plugin will then let you prompt it like so:</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-ollama
llm -m mistral-small:24b "say hi"
</code></pre>

## Quoting Antiqua et Nova

date: 2025-01-30, updated: 2025-01-30, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<blockquote cite="https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_ddf_doc_20250128_antiqua-et-nova_en.html"><p>104. Technology offers remarkable tools to oversee and develop the world's resources. However, in some cases, humanity is increasingly ceding control of these resources to machines. Within some circles of scientists and futurists, there is optimism about the potential of artificial general intelligence (AGI), a hypothetical form of AI that would match or surpass human intelligence and bring about unimaginable advancements. Some even speculate that AGI could achieve superhuman capabilities. At the same time, as society drifts away from a connection with the transcendent, some are tempted to turn to AI in search of meaning or fulfillment---longings that can only be truly satisfied in communion with God. <a href="https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_ddf_doc_20250128_antiqua-et-nova_en.html#_ftn194">[194]</a></p>
<p>105. However, <em>the presumption of substituting God for an artifact of human making is idolatry</em>, a practice Scripture explicitly warns against (e.g., Ex. 20:4; 32:1-5; 34:17). Moreover, AI may prove even more seductive than traditional idols for, unlike idols that "have mouths but do not speak; eyes, but do not see; ears, but do not hear" (Ps. 115:5-6), AI can "speak," or at least gives the illusion of doing so (cf. Rev. 13:15). Yet, it is vital to remember that AI is but a pale reflection of humanity---it is crafted by human minds, trained on human-generated material, responsive to human input, and sustained through human labor. AI cannot possess many of the capabilities specific to human life, and it is also fallible. By turning to AI as a perceived "Other" greater than itself, with which to share existence and responsibilities, humanity risks creating a substitute for God. However, it is not AI that is ultimately deified and worshipped, but humanity itself---which, in this way, becomes enslaved to its own work. <a href="https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_ddf_doc_20250128_antiqua-et-nova_en.html#_ftn195">[195]</a></p></blockquote>

## Was It Cake?

date: 2025-01-30, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p>“It’s not cake!” my wife screamed as the cleaver split the thermostat in our foyer. I pushed past her and sank my chef’s knife into the Ethan Allen sofa we had bought when we moved. Goose down spilled out of the gash. I looked at my wife and grimaced.</p> <p>“Not cake!” our children screeched as they danced in the floating feathers.</p> <p>Seven days prior, we had been selected for a new Netflix game show, <i>Is It Cake? Extreme Home Edition</i>. Once we’d signed the paperwork, we spent one night at the La Quinta off the interstate while the producers replaced one item in our home with a perfect replica made of cake. We had to find the cake within seven days in order to win the grand prize of $75,000. Our time would be up at sunset today, and the sun was getting very low in the sky.</p> <p>“Hurry!” my wife shrieked. “Where is the cake?”</p> <p>I tried to think. I had sledgehammered the pet memorial markers in the backyard to make sure no cake was hidden inside of them. My wife had crashed her Passat into my parked Honda Pilot to make sure the cars were not cake. After the children had gone to bed on Day 6, I had torn apart our modest collection of sex toys. Still no cake.</p> <p>“Maybe the safe?” I yelled at my wife. “Did we look in the safe?”</p> <p>We hurried to our bedroom and opened the safe hidden behind her boots. I punched in the code, and the door swung open. The contents all looked in order, but how could we be sure? I grabbed the handgun&#8212;it didn’t feel like cake, but there was only one way to know. I raised the gun above my head and fired four shots in rapid succession. The noise was deafening.</p> <p>“What the fuck?!” Todd the cameraman shouted. “What is wrong with you? The gun is not cake!”</p> <p>I eyed him. Was it part of his job to trick me? Was the fifth bullet cake? I squeezed off the rest of the clip, shooting skyward. Drywall rained down on us. The ceiling was not cake.</p> <p>“I am fucking leaving!” the cameraman screamed into his headset as he backed out of the room. I was sure he was going to run back to the production van parked in front of our house, probably to stare at the piece of paper that described what item in our house was cake and to laugh at us.</p> <p>My wife was holding the manilla envelope we had filled with paper bonds&#8212;our life savings.</p> <p>“Is this cake?” she asked pleadingly.</p> <p>“I don’t know,” I said. “We will be able to tell if we burn it.”</p> <p>We emptied the $427,000 worth of bonds into our bathroom wastebasket. I grabbed one of the fart matches and threw it into the pile.</p> <p>“Is it burning like paper or cake?” my wife asked desperately.</p> <p>I looked closely at it. How did a cake burn? Ashes floated up around me. I leaned in further and inhaled deeply. I smelled no burnt sugar.</p> <p>“Not cake,” I said quietly.</p> <p>Tearing my clothes off, I ran to the front of the house. My children and wife followed. “Everyone, take your clothes off,” I screamed over my shoulder. &#8220;All of them&#8212;make sure they aren’t cake!&#8221;</p> <p>We emerged from the house naked, and surrounded the production van. I climbed onto the hood and pressed my butt cheeks against the windshield.</p> <p>“Does it feel like cake to your butt cheeks?” my wife howled.</p> <p>“I can’t tell!” I cried and pressed my butt cheeks harder into the glass. I hopped down and shouted commands at my family.</p> <p>“Everyone: put your hands on the van’s side&#8212;smallest ones in the middle! Now, rock the van to see if it’s cake!”</p> <p>Our bare bodies worked in unison, shoving hard. We were on the door side, and the production team was trying to open it and escape.</p> <p>“Don’t let them out!” I screamed. “They might be a jam filling!”</p> <p>We rocked the van back and forth, pushing its center of gravity farther and farther outside of its axis until, finally, it crashed on its side. Glass and plastic covered the street.</p> <p>“It’s not cake!” my wife sobbed, balling up her fists and slamming them against the tires.</p> <p>I turned around and saw the last slivers of light coming across the horizon. My neighbor Brad emerged from his house.</p> <p>“What in the heck, Dominic? What are you doing out here? Why don’t any of you have any clothes on, for Pete’s sake?”</p> <p>My mind reeled. I grabbed the side mirror that had broken off the van and smashed it on the ground, giving it a jagged edge.</p> <p>“You’re the fucking cake, aren’t you, Brad?”</p> <p>Brad backed away, raising his palms to me. “Dominic, can a frankfurting cake talk? What has gotten into you?”</p> <p>It was a persuasive argument. I lowered the mirror and looked down at my naked body. I was bleeding. My children sat on the pavement in a huddled mass, weeping. It was nighttime.</p> <p>I looked up and saw Howie Mandel, the host of <i>Is It Cake? Extreme Home Edition</i>.</p> <p>“We did not find the cake, Howie,” I said.</p> <p>Mandel stared back, disgusted. Police sirens wailed and drew closer.</p> <p>“You’re going to jail, Dominic.”</p> <p>I thought for a moment.</p> <p>“Is the jail cake?”</p>

But was Tiberius really the perverted monster Suetonius would have us believe? Born of Rome’s most illustrious family and a sacred bloodline &#8211; the Claudians &#8211; Tiberius’ mother Livia was unceremoniously taken from [&#8230;]</p>
