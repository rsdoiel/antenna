Happy Birthday, Santa Clarita by City Manager Ken Striplin Just a few
days ago on December 15, the City of Santa Clarita officially turned
36-years-old. Our community has evolved incredibly since incorporation
back in 1987. Originally measuring 39-square-miles, with only 130,000
residents at the time of our incorporation, the City now spans over
73-square-miles and […]

id="jungle-between-colombia-and-panama-becomes-a-highway-for-migrants-from-around-the-world">Jungle
Between Colombia and Panama Becomes a Highway for Migrants From Around
The World</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MEXICO CITY — Once nearly impenetrable for migrants heading north
from Latin America, the jungle between Colombia and Panama this year
became a speedy but still treacherous highway for hundreds of thousands
of people from around the world.   </p>
<p>Driven by economic crises, government repression and violence,
migrants from China to Haiti decided to risk three days of deep mud,
rushing rivers and bandits. Enterprising locals offered guides and
porters, set up campsites and sold supplies to migrants, using
color-coded wristbands to track who had paid for what.   </p>
<p>Enabled by social media and Colombian organized crime, more than
506,000 migrants — nearly two-thirds Venezuelans — had crossed the
Darien jungle by mid-December, double the 248,000 who set a record the
previous year. Before last year, the record was barely 30,000 in
2016.   </p>
<p>Dana Graber Ladek, the Mexico chief for the United Nation’s
International Organization for Migration, said migration flows through
the region this year were “historic numbers that we have never
seen.”   </p>
<p>It wasn’t only in Latin America.   </p>
<p>The number of migrants crossing the Mediterranean or the Atlantic on
small boats to reach Europe this year has surged. More than 250,000
irregular arrivals were registered in 2023, according to the European
Commission.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A significant increase from recent years, the number remains well
below levels seen in the 2015 refugee crisis, when more than 1 million
people landed in Europe, most fleeing wars in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere.
Still, the rise has fed anti-migrant sentiment and laid the groundwork
for tougher legislation.   </p>
<p>Earlier this month, the British government announced tough new
immigration rules aimed at reducing the number of people able to move to
the U.K. each year by hundreds of thousands. Authorized immigration to
the U.K. set a record in 2022 with nearly 750,000.   </p>
<p>A week later, French opposition lawmakers rejected an immigration
bill from President Emmanuel Macron without even debating it. It had
been intended to make it easier for France to expel foreigners
considered undesirable. Far-right politicians alleged the bill would
have increased the number of migrants coming to the country, while
migrant advocates said it threatened the rights of
asylum-seekers.   </p>
<p>In Washington, the debate has shifted from efforts early in the year
to open new legal pathways largely toward measures to keep migrants out
as Republicans try to take advantage of the Biden administration’s push
for more aid to Ukraine to tighten the U.S. southern border.   </p>
<p>The U.S. started the year opening limited spaces to Venezuelans — as
well as Cubans, Nicaraguans and Haitians — in January to enter legally
for two years with a sponsor, while expelling those who didn’t qualify
to Mexico. Their numbers dropped somewhat for a time before climbing
again with renewed vigor.   </p>
<p>Venezuelan Alexander Mercado had only been back in his country for a
month after losing his job in Peru before he and his partner decided to
set off for the United States with their infant son.   </p>
<p>Venezuela’s minimum wage was the equivalent of about $4 a month then,
while 2.2 pounds (a kilogram) of beef was about $5, said Angelis Flores,
his 28-year-old wife.   </p>
<p>“Imagine how someone with a salary of $4 a month survives,” she
said.   </p>
<p>Mercado, 27, and Flores were already on their way when in September
the U.S. announced it was granting temporary legal status to more than
470,000 Venezuelans already in the country. Weeks later, the Biden
administration said it was resuming deportation flights to the South
American nation.   </p>
<p>Mercado and Flores hiked the well-trod trail through the jungle,
managing to push through in three days. Flores and their son, in
particular, got very sick. She believes they were infected by the
contaminated water they drank along the way.   </p>
<p>“There was a body in the middle of river and the ‘zamuros’, those
black birds, were eating it and picking it apart … all of that was
running in the river,” she said.   </p>
<p>For Mercado and Flores, the journey accelerated once they left the
jungle. In October, Panama and Costa Rica announced a deal to speed
migrants across their countries. Panama bused migrants to a center in
Costa Rica where they were held until they could buy a bus ticket to
Nicaragua.   </p>
<p>Nicaragua also seemed to opt for speeding migrants through its
territory. Mercado said they crossed on buses in a day.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>After discovering that Nicaragua had lax visa requirements, Cubans
and Haitians poured into Nicaragua on charter flights, purchasing
roundtrip tickets they never intended. Citizens of African nations made
circuitous series of connecting flights through Africa, Europe and Latin
America to arrive in Managua to start travelling overland toward the
United States, avoiding the Darien.   </p>
<p>In Honduras, Mercado and Flores were given a pass from authorities
allowing them five days to transit the country.   </p>
<p>Adam Isacson, an analyst tracking migration at the Washington Office
on Latin America, said that Panama, Costa Rica and Honduras grant
migrants legal status while they’re transiting the countries, which have
limited resources, and by letting migrants pass legally the countries
make them less vulnerable to extortion from authorities and
smugglers.  </p>
<p>Then there are Guatemala and Mexico, which Isacson called the
“we’re-going-to-make-a-show-of-blocking-you countries” attempting to
score points with the U.S. government.   </p>
<p>For many that has meant spending money to hire smugglers to cross
Guatemala and Mexico, or exposing themselves to repeated extortion
attempts.   </p>
<p>Mercado didn’t hire a smuggler and paid the price. It was “very
difficult to get through Guatemala,” he said. “The police kept taking
money.”   </p>
<p>But that was just a taste of what was to come.   </p>
<p>Standing outside a Mexico City shelter with their son on a recent
afternoon, Flores recounted all of the countries they had
traversed.   </p>
<p>“But they don’t rob you as much, extort you as much, send you back
like when you arrive here to Mexico,” she said. “Here the real nightmare
starts, because as soon as you enter they start taking a lot of your
money.”   </p>
<p>Mexico’s immigration system was thrown into chaos on March 27, when
migrants held in a detention center in the border city Juarez, across
from El Paso, Texas, set mattresses on fire inside their cell in
apparent protest. The highly flammable foam mattresses filled the cell
with thick smoke in an instant. Guards did not open the cell and 40
migrants died.   </p>
<p>The immigration agency’s director was among several officials charged
with crimes ranging from negligence to homicide. The agency closed 33 of
its smaller detention centers while it conducted a review.   </p>
<p>Unable to detain many migrants, Mexico instead circulated them around
the country, using brief, repeat detentions, each an opportunity for
extortion, said Gretchen Kuhner, director of IMUMI, a nongovernmental
legal services organization. Advocates called it the “politica de
desgaste” or wearing down policy.   </p>
<p>Mercado and Flores made it all the way to Matamoros, across the
border from Brownsville, Texas, where they were detained, held for a
night in an immigration facility in the border city of Reynosa and then
flown the next morning 650 miles (1046 kilometers) south to
Villahermosa.   </p>
<p>There they were released, but without their cell phones, shoelaces
and money. Mercado had to wait for his brother to send $100 so they
could start trying to make their way back to Mexico City through an
indirect route that required them to travel by truck, motorbike and even
horse.   </p>
<p>In late November, they had just made it back to Mexico City again.
This time Mercado was unequivocal: They would not leave Mexico City
until the U.S. government gave them an appointment to request asylum at
a border port of entry.   </p>
<p>“It is really hard to make it back here again,” he said. “If they
manage to send me back again I don’t know what I would do.”</p>

id="how-the-us-keeps-funding-ukraines-military-even-as-it-says-its-out-of-money">How
the US Keeps Funding Ukraine’s Military — Even as It Says It’s Out of
Money</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The White House has been increasingly pressuring
Congress to pass stalled legislation to support Ukraine’s war against
Russia, saying that funding has run out.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, however, President Joe Biden touted a new military aid
package worth $200 million for Ukraine.</p>
<p>Money is dwindling. But the announcement of more weapons being sent
to Kyiv just underscores the complexity of the funding. So has the money
run out? Or are there still a few billion dollars floating around?</p>
<p>It’s complicated.</p>
<p>Store credit …</p>
<p>In a Nov. 4 letter to Congress, White House budget director Shalanda
Young said flatly: “We are out of money to support Ukraine in this
fight. This isn’t a next year problem. The time to help a democratic
Ukraine fight against Russian aggression is right now.”</p>
<p>Since then, the U.S. has announced three more aid packages totaling
$475 million. That may seem contradictory, but it’s due to the complex
programs used to send aid to Ukraine.</p>
<p>There are two pots of money for weapons and security assistance set
up specifically for the war. One is the Presidential Drawdown Authority,
or PDA, under which the U.S. provides weapons already in its stockpile.
The other is the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which funds
long-term weapons contracts.</p>
<p>Money for USAI has all been spent. That pot is empty.</p>
<p>And money for the PDA also appeared to be gone. But then the Pentagon
determined that it had overstated the value of the weapons it had
already sent Ukraine, overcharging the Ukraine weapons account by $6.2
billion. That effectively left Ukraine with a store credit that is
slowly being whittled down. It now stands at around $4.4 billion.</p>
<p>PDA packages continued to be announced every few weeks. But in
recognition of the dwindling money, the latest packages have been
smaller — about $200 million or less, compared with previous ones that
often totaled $400 million to $500 million.</p>
<p>… but empty shelves</p>
<p>In theory, the Pentagon would have enough equipment to offer these
smaller packages for months. But there’s a caveat: While the credit
exists, there may not be enough stock on the Pentagon shelves. So some
weapons may be unavailable.</p>
<p>Congressional funding to buy weapons to replace the ones the U.S.
sends to Ukraine is now down to about $1 billion. That dwindling money
means the military services are worried they won’t be able to buy all
the weapons they need to ensure the U.S. military is ready to defend the
American homeland.</p>
<p>For example, the 155 mm rounds commonly used by Howitzers are one of
the most requested artillery munitions by Kyiv. The demand has been so
high that the Army has pressed the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in
Pennsylvania, where the shell casings for the rounds are made, to
increase production in order to meet war demands and have enough on hand
for American military needs.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, told
reporters the U.S. could provide the full $4.4 billion in weapons, but
with only a quarter of that amount available for replenishment, it’s a
tough choice. “We have to start to make decisions about our own
readiness,” he said.</p>
<p>Political wrangling</p>
<p>The U.S. has already sent Ukraine $111 billion in weapons, equipment,
humanitarian assistance and other aid since Russian President Vladimir
Putin launched his invasion more than 21 months ago. But the latest
package is stalled.</p>
<p>Support for Ukraine funding has been waning as some lawmakers see the
war taking funding from domestic needs. But the broader problem is a
political battle over the southern U.S. border.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden is urging Congress to pass a $110 billion aid
package for Ukraine, Israel and other national security needs. It
includes $61.4 billion for Ukraine, with about half to replenish
Pentagon stocks. It also includes about $14 billion for Israel as it
fights Hamas and $14 billion for U.S. border security. Other funds would
go for security needs in the Asia-Pacific.</p>
<p>Prospects for compromise remain in doubt, even as Zelenskyy warned in
a speech at the National Defense University in Washington on Monday
that, “If there’s anyone inspired by unresolved issues on Capitol Hill,
it’s just Putin and his sick clique.”</p>
<p>The jobs argument</p>
<p>Harkening back to the “all politics is local” idea, the Pentagon and
the White House have rolled out maps and statistics to show members of
Congress how their own districts and states are reaping benefits from
the Ukraine funding.</p>
<p>Charts detail $10 billion in industry contracts for weapons ranging
from air defense systems and missiles to a wide array of drones,
ammunition and other equipment. And they break out an additional nearly
$16.8 billion in contracts to replenish Pentagon stocks.</p>
<p>The maps show contracts benefitting industries and companies in more
than 35 different states. And U.S. officials are hoping the local jobs
argument will help build support for the funding.</p>
<p>How big is the need?</p>
<p>Winter has set in, so the fighting in Ukraine has leveled off a bit.
And along stretches of the battlefront, fighting is somewhat
stalemated.</p>
<p>But Ukrainian forces have been taking ground back in some key
locations, and Zelenskyy and other leaders have said they want to keep
pushing forward. Ukraine does not want to give the Russians weeks or
months this winter to reset and further solidify their fighting
positions — as they did last winter.</p>
<p>During his visit to Washington this week, Zelenskyy said his forces
are making progress, and the White House pointed to newly declassified
intelligence that shows Ukraine has inflicted heavy losses on Russia in
recent fighting around the eastern city of Avdiivka — including 13,000
casualties and over 220 combat vehicles lost. The Ukrainian holdout in
the country’s partly occupied east has been the center of some of the
fiercest fighting in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Putin on Thursday, however, said his troops are making gains.</p>
<p>“Almost all along the line of contact our armed forces, let’s put it
modestly, are improving their positions, almost all are in an active
stage of action and there is an improvement in the position of our
troops all along,” he said.</p>

<h2 id="us-woman-criminally-charged-after-miscarriage">US Woman
Criminally Charged After Miscarriage</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio — Ohio was in the throes of a bitter debate over
abortion rights this fall when Brittany Watts, 21 weeks and 5 days
pregnant, began passing thick blood clots.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old Watts, who had not shared the news of her pregnancy
even with her family, made her first prenatal visit to a doctor’s office
behind Mercy Health-St. Joseph’s Hospital in Warren, a working-class
city about 100 kilometers southeast of Cleveland.</p>
<p>The doctor said that, while a fetal heartbeat was still present,
Watts’ water had broken prematurely and the fetus she was carrying would
not survive. He advised heading to the hospital to have her labor
induced, so she could have what amounted to an abortion to deliver the
nonviable fetus. Otherwise, she would face “significant risk” of death,
records of her case show.</p>
<p>That was a Tuesday in September. What followed was a harrowing three
days entailing: multiple trips to the hospital; Watts miscarrying into,
and then flushing and plunging, a toilet at her home; a police
investigation of those actions; and Watts, who is Black, being charged
with abuse of a corpse. That’s a fifth-degree felony punishable by up to
a year in prison and a $2,500 fine.</p>
<p>Her case was sent last month to a grand jury. It has touched off a
national firestorm over the treatment of pregnant women, and especially
Black women, in the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs v.
Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision that overturned Roe v.
Wade.</p>
<p>Civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump elevated Watts’ plight in a post
to X, formerly Twitter.</p>
<p>Michele Goodwin, a law professor at the University of California,
Irvine, and author of Policing The Womb, said the case follows a pattern
of women’s pregnancies being criminalized against them. She said those
efforts have long overwhelmingly targeted Black and brown women.</p>
<p>Even before Roe was overturned, studies show that Black women who
visited hospitals for prenatal care were 10 times more likely than white
women to have child protective services and law enforcement called on
them, even when their cases were similar, she said.</p>
<p>“Post-Dobbs, what we see is kind of a wild, wild West,” said Goodwin.
“You see this kind of muscle-flexing by district attorneys and
prosecutors wanting to show that they are going to be vigilant, they’re
going to take down women who violate the ethos coming out of the state’s
Legislature.”</p>
<p>She called Black women “canaries in the coal mine” for the
“hyper-vigilant type of policing” women of all races might expect from
the nation’s network of health care providers, law enforcers and courts
now that abortion isn’t federally protected.</p>
<p>At the time of Watts’ miscarriage, abortion was legal in Ohio through
21 weeks, six days of pregnancy. Her lawyer, Traci Timko, said Watts sat
for eight hours at Mercy Health-St. Joseph’s awaiting care on the eve of
her pregnancy reaching 22 weeks, before leaving without being
treated.</p>
<p>Timko said hospital officials had been deliberating over the
legalities.</p>
<p>“It was the fear of, is this going to constitute an abortion and are
we able to do that,” Timko said. The hospital didn’t return calls
seeking confirmation and comment.</p>
<p>But B. Jessie Hill, a law professor at Case Western Reserve
University School of Law, said the hospital was in a bind.</p>
<p>“These are the razor’s edge decisions that health care providers are
being forced to make,” she said. “And all the incentives are pushing
hospitals to be conservative, because on the other side of this is
criminal liability.”</p>
<p>Warren Assistant Prosecutor Lewis Guarnieri told Warren Municipal
Court Judge Terry Ivanchak during Watts’ preliminary hearing that she
left home for a hair appointment after miscarrying, leaving the toilet
clogged. Police would later find the fetus wedged in the pipes.</p>
<p>“The issue isn’t how the child died, when the child died,” Guarnieri
told the judge, according to TV station WKBN. “It’s the fact the baby
was put into a toilet, was large enough to clog up the toilet, left in
that toilet, and she went on (with) her day.”</p>
<p>In court, Timko bristled.</p>
<p>“This 33-year-old girl with no criminal record is demonized for
something that goes on every day,” she said.</p>
<p>The size and stage of development of Watts’ fetus became an issue
during her preliminary hearing.</p>
<p>At the time, vigorous campaigning over Issue 1, an ultimately
successful amendment to enshrine a right to abortion in Ohio’s
constitution, included ads alleging the amendment would allow abortions
“until birth.”</p>
<p>A county forensic investigator reported feeling “what appeared to be
a small foot with toes” inside Watts’ toilet. Police seized the toilet
and broke it apart to retrieve the intact fetus as evidence. An autopsy
confirmed that the fetus died in utero before passing through the birth
canal and identified “no recent injuries.”</p>
<p>The judge acknowledged the case’s complexities when he bound the case
over to the grand jury.</p>
<p>“There are better scholars than I am to determine the exact legal
status of this fetus, corpse, body, birthing tissue, whatever it is,” he
said from the bench.</p>
<p>Assistant Trumbull County Prosecutor Diane Barber, lead prosecutor on
Watts’ case, could not speak specifically about the case, other than to
note the county is compelled to move forward with it. She doesn’t expect
a grand jury finding this month.</p>
<p>Timko, a former prosecutor, said Ohio’s abuse-of-corpse statute is
vague.</p>
<p>“From a legal perspective, there’s no definition of ‘corpse,’” she
said. “Can you be a corpse if you never took a breath?”</p>
<p>Grace Howard, assistant justice studies professor at San José State
University, said clarity on what about Watts’ behavior constituted a
crime is essential.</p>
<p>“Her miscarriage was entirely ordinary,” she said. “So I just want to
know what (the prosecutor) thinks she should have done. If we are going
to require people to collect and bring used menstrual products to
hospitals so that they can make sure it is indeed a miscarriage, it’s as
ridiculous and invasive as it is cruel.”</p>

<h2 id="face-masks-now-an-occasional-feature-of-us-landscape">Face Masks
Now an Occasional Feature of US Landscape</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — The scene: A crowded shopping center in the weeks before
Christmas. Or a warehouse store. Or maybe a packed airport terminal or a
commuter train station or another place where large groups gather.</p>
<p>There are people — lots of people. But look around, and it’s clear
one thing is largely absent these days: face masks.</p>
<p>Yes, there’s the odd one here and there, but nothing like it was
three years ago at the dawn of the COVID pandemic’s first winter
holidays — an American moment of contentiousness, accusation and scorn
on both sides of the mask debate.</p>
<p>As 2023 draws to an end, with promises of holiday parties and crowds
and lots of inadvertent exchanges of shared air, mask-wearing is much
more off than on around the country even as COVID’s long tail lingers.
The days of anything approaching a widespread mask mandate would be like
the Ghost of Christmas Past, a glimpse into what was.</p>
<p>Look at it a different way, though: These days, mask-wearing has
become just another thing that simply happens in America. In a country
where the mention of a mask prior to the pandemic usually meant
Halloween or a costume party, it’s a new way of being that hasn’t gone
away even if most people aren’t doing it regularly.</p>
<p>“That’s an interesting part of the pandemic,” says Brooke Tully, a
strategist who works on how to change people’s behaviors.</p>
<p>“Home delivery of food and all of those kind of services, they
existed before COVID and actually were gaining some momentum,” she says.
“But something like mask-wearing in the U.S. didn’t really have an
existing baseline. It was something entirely new in COVID. So it’s one
of those new introductions of behaviors and norms.”</p>
<p>The situation now is … situational</p>
<p>It tends to be situational, like the recent decision from the
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center hospital system to reinstate a
mask mandate at its facilities starting Dec. 20 because it’s seeing an
increase in respiratory viruses. And for people like Sally Kiser, 60, of
Mooresville, North Carolina, who manages a home health care agency.</p>
<p>“I always carry one with me,” she says, “’cause I never know.”</p>
<p>She doesn’t always wear it, depending on the environment she’s in,
but she will if she thinks it’s prudent. “It’s kind of like a new
paradigm for the world we live in,” she says.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that long ago that fear over catching COVID-19 sent demand
for masks into overdrive, with terms like “N95” coming into our
vocabularies alongside concepts like mask mandates — and the subsequent,
and vehement, backlash from those who felt it was government
overreach.</p>
<p>Once the mandates started dropping, the masks started coming off and
the demand fell. It fell so much so that Project N95, a nonprofit
launched during the pandemic to help people find quality masks,
announced earlier this month that it would stop sales Monday because
there wasn’t enough interest.</p>
<p>Anne Miller, the organization’s executive director, acknowledges she
thought widespread mask usage would become the rule, not the
exception.</p>
<p>“I thought the new normal would be like we see in other cultures and
other parts of the world — where people just wear a mask out of an
abundance of caution for other people,” she says.</p>
<p>But that’s not how norms work, public safety or otherwise, says
Markus Kemmelmeier, a professor of sociology at the University of
Nevada, Reno.</p>
<p>In 2020, Kemmelmeier authored a study about mask-wearing around the
country that showed mask usage and mandate resistance varied by region
based on conditions including pre-existing cultural divisions and
political orientation.</p>
<p>He points to the outcry after the introduction of seat belts and seat
belt laws more than four decades ago as an example of how practices,
particularly those required in certain parts of society, do or don’t
take hold.</p>
<p>“When they first were instituted with all the sense that they make
and all the effectiveness, there was a lot of resistance,” Kemmelmeier
says. “The argument was basically lots of complaints about individual
freedoms being curtailed and so forth, and you can’t tell me what to do
and so forth.”</p>
<p>Figuring out the balance</p>
<p>In New York City’s Brooklyn borough, members of the Park Slope Co-op
recently decided there was a need at the longstanding,
membership-required grocery. Last month, the co-op instituted
mask-required Wednesdays and Thursdays; the other five days continue to
have no requirement.</p>
<p>The people who proposed it weren’t focused on COVID rates. They were
thinking about immune-compromised people, a population that has always
existed but came to mainstream awareness during the pandemic, says co-op
general manager Joe Holtz.</p>
<p>Proponents of the mask push at the co-op emphasized that
immunocompromised people are more at risk from other people’s
respiratory ailments like colds and flu. Implementing a window of
required mask usage allows them to be more protected, Holtz says.</p>
<p>It was up to the store’s administrators to pick the days, and they
went with two of the slowest instead of the busy weekend days on
purpose, Holtz says, a nod to the reality that mask requirements get
different responses from people.</p>
<p>“From management’s point of view,” he says, “if we were going to try
and if there’s going to be a negative financial impact from this
decision that was made, we want to minimize it.”</p>
<p>Those shopping there on a recent Thursday didn’t seem fazed.</p>
<p>Aron Halberstam, 77, says he doesn’t usually mask much these days but
wasn’t put off by the requirement. He wears a mask on the days it’s
required, even if he doesn’t otherwise — a middle ground reflecting what
is happening in so many parts of the country more than three years after
the mask became a part of daily conversation and daily life.</p>
<p>“Any place which asks you to do it, I just do it,” Halberstam says.
“I have no resistance to it.”</p>
<p>Whatever the level of resistance, says Kemmelmeier, the culture has
shifted. People are still wearing masks in places like crowded stores or
while traveling. They do so because they choose to for their own reasons
and not because the government is requiring it. And new reasons can come
up as well, like when wildfires over the summer made air quality poor
and people used masks to deal with the haze and smoke.</p>
<p>“It always will find a niche to fit in with,” he says. “And as long
as there are needs somewhere, it will survive.”</p>

<p>Today is the 250th anniversary of the Boston Tea Party, when 30 or
more men boarded three trading vessels in Boston Harbor. They broke open
342 chests of tea and dumped about 90,000 pounds of the valuable leaves
overboard. The pointed destruction of a cargo worth about $1.7 million
in today’s dollars escalated the ongoing struggle between the British
government and thirteen of its North American colonies.</p>

different alarms which can be repeated daily, on workdays, on weekends
or just in selected day of week. It fitted my needs very well. And she
sound was loud enough (unlike the alarm on m68k Palms which is useless
because it is quiet and very short). It has been also practical to have
a simple note taking device near my bed - to record some evening ideas

id="confederate-memorial-to-be-removed-from-arlington-national-cemetery">Confederate
Memorial to be Removed From Arlington National Cemetery</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>arlington, virginia — A Confederate memorial is to be removed from
Arlington National Cemetery in the U.S. state of Virginia in the coming
days, part of the push to remove symbols that commemorate the
Confederacy from military-related facilities, a cemetery official said
Saturday. </p>
<p>The decision ignores a recent demand from more than 40 Republican
congressmen that the Pentagon suspend efforts to dismantle and remove
the monument from Arlington cemetery. </p>
<p>Safety fencing has been installed around the memorial, and officials
anticipate completing the removal by December 22, the Arlington National
Cemetery said in an email. During the removal, the surrounding
landscape, graves and headstones will be protected, the Arlington
National Cemetery said. </p>
<p>Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin disagrees with the decision and
plans to move the monument to the New Market Battlefield State
Historical Park in the Shenandoah Valley, Youngkin spokeswoman Macaulay
Porter said. </p>
<p>In 2022, an independent commission recommended that the memorial be
taken down, as part of its final report to Congress on renaming of
military bases and assets that commemorate the Confederacy. </p>
<p>The statue, unveiled in 1914, features a bronze woman, crowned with
olive leaves, standing on a 32-foot pedestal, and was designed to
represent the American South. According to Arlington, the woman holds a
laurel wreath, a plow stock and a pruning hook, with a Biblical
inscription at her feet that says: “They have beat their swords into
plough-shares and their spears into pruning hooks.” </p>
<p>Some of the figures also on the statue include a Black woman depicted
as “Mammy” holding what is said to be the child of a white officer, and
an enslaved man following his owner to war. </p>
<p>In a recent letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, more than 40
House Republicans said the commission overstepped its authority when it
recommended that the monument be removed. The congressmen contended that
the monument “does not honor nor commemorate the Confederacy; the
memorial commemorates reconciliation and national unity.” </p>
<p>“The Department of Defense must respect Congress’ clear legislative
intentions regarding the Naming Commission’s legislative authority” the
letter said. </p>
<p>U.S. Representative Andrew Clyde, a Georgia Republican, has led the
push to block the memorial’s removal. Clyde’s office did not immediately
respond to an email seeking comment Saturday. </p>
<p>A process to prepare for the memorial’s removal and relocation has
been completed, the cemetery said. The memorial’s bronze elements will
be relocated, while the granite base and foundation will remain in place
to avoid disturbing surrounding graves, it said. </p>
<p>Earlier this year, Fort Bragg shed its Confederate namesake to become
Fort Liberty, part of the broad Department of Defense initiative,
motivated by the 2020 George Floyd protests, to rename military
installations that had been named after confederate soldiers. </p>
<p>The North Carolina base was originally named in 1918 for General
Braxton Bragg, a Confederate general from Warrenton, North Carolina, who
was known for owning slaves and losing key Civil War battles that
contributed to the Confederacy’s downfall. </p>
<p>The Black Lives Matter demonstrations that erupted nationwide after
Floyd’s killing by a white police officer, coupled with ongoing efforts
to remove Confederate monuments, turned the spotlight on the Army
installations. The naming commission created by Congress visited the
bases and met with members of the surrounding communities for input.</p>

Destroyer Downs 14 Drones in Red Sea Launched From Yemen</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — An American destroyer shot down more than a dozen drones
Saturday in the Red Sea launched from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen,
the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said. </p>
<p>“The Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer USS CARNEY…
operating in the Red Sea, successfully engaged 14 unmanned aerial
systems launched as a drone wave from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen,”
CENTCOM said on X, formerly known as Twitter. </p>
<p>The aerial vehicles were “assessed to be one-way attack drones and
were shot down with no damage to ships in the area or reported
injuries,” according to the statement. </p>
<p>Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels have launched a series of drone and
missile strikes targeting Israel since Hamas militants poured over the
border into Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people, mostly
civilians, according to Israeli figures. Around 240 people were
kidnapped in the attacks.  </p>
<p>Vowing to destroy Hamas and bring back the hostages, Israel launched
a massive military offensive that the Hamas-run territory’s health
ministry says has killed more than 18,000 people, mostly women and
children, according to the latest toll from the Hamas government in
Gaza. </p>
<p>The Houthi rebels have threatened to attack any vessels heading to
Israeli ports unless food and medicine are allowed into the besieged
Gaza Strip. </p>
<p>The latest attacks mark a significant escalation in the threat to
shipping in the area.</p>

<p>No matter how hard we try, no matter how much we want to make a

Welcomes Museum’s Plan to Return Looted Antiquities</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PHNOM PENH, CAMBODIA — Cambodia has welcomed the announcement that
New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art will return more than a dozen
pieces of ancient artwork to Cambodia and Thailand that were tied to an
art dealer and collector accused of running a huge antiquity trafficking
network out of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>This most recent repatriation of artwork comes as many museums in the
United States and Europe reckon with collections that contain objects
looted from Asia, Africa and other places during centuries of
colonialism or in times of upheaval.</p>
<p>Fourteen Khmer sculptures will be returned to Cambodia and two will
be returned to Thailand, the Manhattan museum announced Friday, although
no specific timeline was given.</p>
<p>“We appreciate this first step in the right direction,” said a
statement issued by Cambodia’s Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts. “We
look forward to further returns and acknowledgements of the truth
regarding our lost national treasures, taken from Cambodia in the time
of war and genocide.”</p>
<p>Cambodia suffered from war and the brutal rule of the communist Khmer
Rouge in the 1970s and 1980s, causing disorder that opened the
opportunity for its archaeological treasures to be looted.</p>
<p>The repatriation of the ancient pieces was linked to well-known art
dealer Douglas Latchford, who was indicted in 2019 for allegedly
orchestrating a multiyear scheme to sell looted Cambodian antiquities on
the international art market. Latchford, who died the following year,
had denied any involvement in smuggling.</p>
<p>The museum initially cooperated with the U.S. attorney’s office in
Manhattan and the New York office of Homeland Security Investigations on
the return of 13 sculptures tied to Latchford before determining there
were three more that should be repatriated.</p>
<p>“As demonstrated with today’s announcement, pieces linked to the
investigation of Douglas Latchford continue to reveal themselves,” HSI
Acting Special Agent in Charge Erin Keegan said in a statement Friday.
“The Metropolitan Museum of Art has not only recognized the significance
of these 13 Khmer artifacts, which were shamelessly stolen, but has also
volunteered to return them, as part of their ongoing cooperation, to
their rightful owners: the People of Cambodia.”</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time the museum has repatriated art linked to
Latchford. In 2013, it returned two objects to Cambodia.</p>
<p>The Latchford family also had a load of centuries-old Cambodian
jewelry in their possession that they later returned to Cambodia. In
February, 77 pieces of jewelry made of gold and other precious metal
pieces — including items such as crowns, necklaces and earrings — were
returned. Other stone and bronze artifacts were returned in September
2021.</p>
<p>Pieces being returned include a bronze sculpture called the
“Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara Seated in Royal Ease,” made sometime
between the late 10th century and early 11th century. Another piece of
art, made of stone in the seventh century and named “Head of Buddha,”
will also be returned. Those pieces are part of 10 that can still be
viewed in the museum’s galleries while arrangements are made for their
return.</p>
<p>“These returns contribute to the reconciliation and healing of the
Cambodian people who went through decades of civil war and suffered
tremendously from the tragedy of the Khmer Rouge genocide, and to a
greater strengthening of our relationship with the United States,”
Cambodia’s Minister of Culture and Fine Arts, Phoeurng Sackona, said in
her agency’s statement.</p>
<p>Research efforts were already underway by the museum to examine the
ownership history of its objects, focusing on how ancient art and
cultural property changed hands, as well as the provenance of
Nazi-looted artwork.</p>

<p>
Who cares if a node blocks them, what’s really going to

their App Store.
</p>
<p>
And that is how it’s going to work.
</p>
<p>
They’re also going to implement Facebook-only APIs, and you’re going to
want to support them, because they give you access to many millions of
people.

<p>
It might be better for the Fediverse if they’re just bluffing, but don’t
be so sure you’re going to like the way it works once they’re fully in

Linkdump Minkchump (16 Dec 2023)</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-16, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Linkdump Minkchump: A thoroughly assorted Saturday.
This day in history: 2003, 2008, 2013, 2018, 2022 Colophon: Recent
publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects,
current reading Linkdump Minkchump (permalink) It’s linkdump time!
Saturday has arrived and I once again find myself with a zillion tabs’
worth of things that I couldn’t squeeze into this week’s newsletters.
This is lucky linkdump number 13 – here’s the previous dozen
installments: https://pluralistic.net/tag/linkdump/ Let’s ease into it
with some whimsy: a Death Metal cover of JohnCage’s 4’33” from Dead
Territory. Warning, once you hear them perform this banger, it’ll be
stuck in your head all day, especially in those quiet moments of
reflection: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGEG4JiOqew Those guys go
hard. You know who else goes hard? Billionaires. Especially when they’re
bribing judges. The Clarence Thomas/Samuel Alito bribery scandal
prompted the Supremes to proffer an entirely ornamental and toothless
code of conduct:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/17/red-team-black-robes/#security-theater
It takes a lot of work to create an accountability mechanism that’s
worse than the system that other federal judges answer to. The Judicial
Conference oversees the rest of the federal bench, and it’s far too
flimsy to qualify as a paper tiger – maybe a toilet-paper kitten?
https://www.propublica.org/article/judicial-conference-scotus-federal-judges-ethics-rules
Here’s how weak the ethics code for non-SCOTUS federal judges is: 100
members of the US federal judiciary enjoyed 251 luxury junkets paid for
by two billionaire-controlled dark money orgs:
https://www.levernews.com/billionaires-are-bankrolling-judges-luxury-travel/
The Antonin Scalia Law School (“the finest in legal education”) funneled
money from its wealthy backers to judges on 152 occasions, paying for
transport, meals and/or lodging. The Federalist Society did the same on
at least 99 occasions. Gifts from these two orgs constitute 42% of all
judicial disclosures from the entire judiciary. While some of these
trips took judges to GMU’s campus, the majority of these junkets were
sited at tropical beauty-spots at fancy resorts. No other organization
does anything remotely similar and not every judge gets to enjoy Fedsoc
and GMU hospitality – just the ones who produce rulings favorable to the
organizations’ backers. Oligarchy takes many forms, but it is a single
project: the transfer of wealth and power from the many to the few. This
isn’t an easy sell. The manifest problems of organizing our society to
benefit a few wealthy people at the expense of the rest of us mean that
the system’s legitimacy is constantly crumbling and must be continuously
shored up. Take the US “health” system, unique on the world stage for
how much it costs and how little it delivers. As with other American
pathologies (like, say, internet access), the US health system is more
expensive and less effective than dozens of rival systems (however, it
is more lucrative than those systems). And yet…the US health insurance
system keeps finding new depths of sleaze to plumb. From Patrick M
Rucker, Doris Burke and David Armstrong for Capitol Forum and
Propublica: a deeply reported story of the worst doctors in America and
their indispensable role for insurers:
https://www.propublica.org/article/malpractice-settlements-doctors-working-for-insurance-companies
Doctors are overwhelmingly highly trained, ethical professionals who
want to help their patients. But they are often thwarted by insurers,
who deny their recommended treatments as unnecessary. When patients
complain that corporate bean-counters are overriding their medical
professionals’ advice, the insurers insist that nothing of the sort is
taking place. Your claims aren’t being denied by an algorithm or an
accountant – rather, they’re being individually reviewed by another
qualified MD, who’s helping you avoid allopathic risk by offering a
second opinion and keeping you safe from unnecessary interventions. It’s
true that insurance companies pay trained doctors to assess (and deny)
claims – but which doctors do they employ? Absolute fucking butchers.
Propublica found that insurance companies are the preferred second act
for MDs who have lost their medical licenses and their malpractice
insurance after repeatedly, egregiously maiming and killing their
patients. These doctors bumbled their way out of the ability to see
patients, and now they get paid big bucks to review 10,000 cases per
year and override the judgments of their competent, still-practicing
peers. Only in America! These docs killed with scalpels and prescription
pads, and now they get to continue to hurt the sick and injured with a
DENIED rubber-stamp. Oligarchy makes everything worse – even Twitter, a
thing that was objectively very bad before it was acquired by a fool who
found greater fools to bankroll his folly. An excellent package in The
Verge lays out a timeline of bad-to-worse, leavened with some of the
better moments:
https://www.theverge.com/c/23972308/twitter-x-death-tweets-history-elon-musk
Musk didn’t inaugurate Twitter’s enshittification, but he sure speedran
it. The sudden platform collapse syndrome he brought to the hellsite
prompted a mass exodus, with millions of ex-Twitterers landing on
Mastodon. Of course, not all of them stayed on Mastodon, which is a
totally normal pattern for platform growth:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/11/of-course-mastodon-lost-users/ Far
more interesting are the people who wanted to leave Twitter, but didn’t.
Bootlicker economists will tell you that your continued presence on a
platform you loathe is a “revealed preference.” As David Roth says, the
job of a neoclassical economist is to come up with new ways to say,
“Actually, your boss is right.” Meanwhile, tech bros will tell you that
the reason you keep using their products despite professing a deep
loathing for them is that they are dopamine-hacking evil sorcerers, a
claim that doubles as a salespitch to credulous advertisers who love the
idea that they can rent time on a mind-control ray and use it to trick
you into buying their garbage. But there’s a simpler explanation for
platform stickiness, one that neither gaslights you by insisting that
you like things you hate, nor does it validate the self-serving claims
of delusional high-tech Rasputins. The reason you use platforms you hate
is because you love the people there. The reason they’re using the
platform is that you’re there. You have a collective action problem: you
all want to go, but you can’t agree on when to depart or where to go.
You’re like the residents of Anatevka in Fiddler On the Roof, who,
despite getting six kinds of shit kicked out of them by Cossacks on the
reg, all stay put in their village because they can’t bear to part with
one another:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/23/when-the-town-square-shatters/ A
scholarly analysis of which communities left Twitter supports this
thesis. “Drivers of social influence in the Twitter migration to
Mastodon,” published in Nature, finds that the looser a community was –
the less important its members were to one another – the easier it was
for them to up sticks and move from Twitter to Mastodon:
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-48200-7 In other words, if
the people you hung out with on Twitter weren’t that important to you,
then switching to Mastodon wasn’t a big deal. You would find equally
satisfying people to hang out with there. Ironically, this made it easy
for the community to remain intact, because its members could trickle
from one platform to the other without undue suffering during the
transitional phase. Your ability to change your technology habits is
ultimately governed by “switching costs” – the things you have to give
up when you go switch vendors. When a company can hold something you
value hostage – the people you love, the data you rely on, or even
access to your front door locks – then can treat you worse and you’ll
still stick around. The “revealed preference” here is that you like your
family photos more than you hate Mark Zuckerberg:
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/facebooks-secret-war-switching-costs
If we’re going to make a new, good internet that stays good, we have to
keep switching costs low. One way to do that is to decentralize our
services through federation, like Mastodon does. But federation is just
table-stakes. For full decentralization, you want peer-to-peer, in which
our devices talk directly to one another. P2P was once the new hotness,
but copyright lawsuits chased P2P design underground for a generation.
Now, it’s reemerging. New P2P systems are popping up and popping off. My
EFF colleague Ross Schulman breaks down the promise of two of these:
Spritely and Veilid – the latter having taken last summer’s Defcon by
storm: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/12/meet-spritely-and-veilid
Moving the locus of control to your own device is critical to staving
off abusive conduct. If you want to make sure a company won’t hurt you,
then make sure it can’t hurt you. High-tech guns on the mantelpiece in
Act I will blow your face off in Act III. Last week, I wrote about
Polish security researchers who discovered that NEWAG, who make
locomotives, had boobytrapped them with remote killswitches that shut
them down if they were independently serviced:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/08/playstationed/#tyler-james-hill It’s
a wild story, and it keeps getting wilder. This week, 404 Media’s Jason
Koebler got deeper into the story, surfacing juicy technical details and
connecting the scam to his years of excellent reporting on right to
repair:
https://www.404media.co/polish-hackers-repaired-trains-the-manufacturer-artificially-bricked-now-the-train-company-is-threatening-them/
The dirty tricks used to brick locomotives to punish disloyal customers
are widespread in heavy equipment, but they started in personal devices.
Apple, in particular, has been an endless innovator of fuckery, finding
all kinds of nasty ways to control how you use your device after you buy
it: https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/22/vin-locking/#thought-differently
Inevitably, Apple insists that it’s engaging in these dirty tricks to
protect it customers. That’s the rhetoric the three trillion dollar tech
giant rolled out last week when they smeared Beeper Mini:
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/12/without-interoperability-apple-customers-will-never-be-secure
Beeper Mini is an iMessage app for Android, which independently
re-implements Apple’s iMessage end-to-end encryption so that Apple
customers’ data isn’t left unprotected and unencrypted when they
communicate with Android users. Apple’s message to its customers is that
if they want security, they should confine themselves to communicating
with other Apple customers. If that’s not good enough, Apple says, you
should buy your Android-using friends iPhones:
https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/7/23342243/tim-cook-apple-rcs-imessage-android-iphone-compatibility
This is of a piece with Apple’s anti-repair rhetoric. Apple claims that
they’re taking away your right to get your phone repaired by the depot
of your choosing in order to protect you from unethical repairers who
steal your data. That really is a risk:
https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-computer-repair-shops-customers-personal-data/
But it’s a risk that can be mitigated. Google just announced a new
“Repair Mode” for Android devices – this lets technicians boot and test
your phone without accessing your data:
https://gizmodo.com/google-pixel-8-phone-self-repair-1851102537 It’s
nice to see Google guarding its customers’ backs every now and again,
even from its depraved enshittified depths. Google also just announced
that it will move GMaps’ location data storage to your device. That
means that it will no longer be able to use Maps data to answer
“geofence warrants” (AKA “reverse warrants”), where the cops demand the
identities of everyone in a location – say, all the participants in a
Black Lives Matter demonstration:
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/12/end-geofence-warrants As with
Repair Mode, this is a best of all worlds solution. Maps users can still
get access to their location history, but Google can’t. Google’s also
end-to-end encrypting Maps data backups, so you can store your Maps data
in the cloud and recover it if you lose your device, but Google can’t
see that data and use it to answer law enforcement demands. It’s a
marker of how far Google has moved on locational privacy. Just a couple
years ago, top Google execs who oversaw Google Maps were caught
complaining that they couldn’t figure out how to opt out of Google
location tracking: https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/01/you-are-here/#goog
That’s why – as my EFF colleague Jen Lynch writes, we have to look very
closely at these new privacy promises:
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/12/end-geofence-warrants “Google
collects additional location information as well. It remains to be seen
whether law enforcement will find a way to access these other stores of
location data on a mass basis in the future”:
https://apnews.com/article/828aefab64d4411bac257a07c1af0ecb Sorting
corporate technical claims from reality requires independent
verification and discussion – AKA hackers. The reverse-engineers who
relentlessly poke at the workings of tech are how we get to find out
whether it’s safe to rely on the systems in our life. One of the oldest
and best hacker cons in 2600’s Hackers On Planet Earth (HOPE), now
heading into its fifteenth biannual edition:
https://www.2600.com/content/hope-xv-officially-announced-special-ticket-deal-week
I’ve attended many of these cons, and they’re amazing. I’m also a huge
fan of 2600 magazine – I’m a contributor and lifetime subscriber. The
archives of 2600 were critical when I was researching and writing Picks
and Shovels, the third Martin Hench novel, which comes out in Feb 2025.
I relied on 2600’s DRM-free ebook archives:
https://www.2600.com/Magazine/digital-back-issues Keeping ebooks
DRM-free means that they don’t contribute to high switching costs that
lock you into platforms that harm you. If you can quit a platform and
keep your ebooks, then the second a platform sours, you can bolt for the
exits. This cuts both ways: DRM keeps readers locked into platforms, but
it also keeps publishers locked in. As Charlie Stross prophesied over a
decade ago, Kindle DRM locks in the publishers’ best customers, meaning
that the publishers would not be able to credibly threaten to sell
elsewhere because their readers wouldn’t be able to leave Amazon without
surrendering their books:
http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2012/04/more-on-drm-and-ebooks.html
In the intervening years, Amazon has found a myriad of ways to shift
value from publishers to themselves. Pro-monopoly economists say this
doesn’t matter, so long as Amazon remains good to readers, but
unfortunately for those economists, reality has an anti-neoliberal bias:
https://www.fastcompany.com/90996547/e-books-are-fast-becoming-tools-of-corporate-surveillance
Ebooks are now surveillance honeypots, allowing Amazon to capture an
astonishing amount of private data on readers – data that is especially
dangerous in an era of rampant book banning:
https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2023-12-07-25-human-rights-organizations-call-on-2024-congress-to-investigate-big-tech-and-publishings-stranglehold-over-digital-books
The irony here is that all of this surveillance data isn’t even
accessible to publishers, who know less about their readers every day –
even as Amazon, a monopolist that dominates bookselling, and competes
directly with publishers – becomes the world’s leading authority on
publishers’ best customers. Blunders like DRM make it easy to dismiss
publishing as a “legacy industry.” But any industry that sticks around
long enough will accumulate layers of hard-to-budge cruft. Irrational
conduct is often an emergent property of a series of perfectly rational
choices. For a fascinating case-study in how this works, check out
Patrick McKenzie’s history of how checks came into existence in the USA,
and why American still rely on these antiquates slips of paper to move
billions of dollars around:
https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/the-long-shadow-of-checks/ But
inertia can be broken. When the status quo is terrible enough, and the
alternatives are compelling enough, we can change. Take the US job
market. Today, the true US minimum wage is $0: that’s how much you earn
if no one will give you a job. The “actually, your boss is right”
economists insist that this is a feature, not a bug. The reserve army of
unemployed people – we’re told – are necessary to fight inflation. When
inflation rises, these economists insist that we have to make more
people unemployed, to save the economy:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/01/mayday/#inflationary-political-economy
But there’s another form of automatic price-stabilization, one that’s
been tried before in the USA to enormous success: a “Job Guarantee.”
That’s where the feds fund jobs that are administered by local
governments. These jobs – at socially inclusive wages, with good
benefits – set the true minimum wage in the economy, because bosses have
to beat the job guarantee offer to attract employees. The best authority
on the Job Guarantee is Pavlina Tcherneva. Her slim book on the subject
is a fantastic explainer, from how the New Deal’s Civilian Conservation
Corps’s proof of the lasting improvements a Job Guarantee can deliver to
the nation, to how a new Job Guarantee could be part of a Green New
Deal:
https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2020-06-24/forget-ubi-says-an-economist-its-time-for-universal-basic-jobs
Tcherneva’s book was partial inspiration for my latest novel, the
bestselling solarpunk adventure The Lost Cause, where a Green New Deal
and its Job Guarantee are both under threat from seagoing, Neal
Stephenson LARPing billionaire wreckers and their white nationalist,
onshore shock troops:
https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865939/the-lost-cause The case for
a Job Guarantee is even stronger today than it was a couple years ago,
when I was writing the novel. Tcherneva’s just launched “The Job
Guarantee Program” (“An essential resource for scholars, policymakers,
and engaged citizens”): https://www.jobguarantee.org/ The next time
Larry Summers and co insist that we need to create an army of unemployed
people to save the economy, you can refer them to the site’s FAQ:
https://www.jobguarantee.org/faqs/ That about wraps up this week’s
linkdump. It only remains for me to leave you with a lighthearted palate
cleanser – a glorious Rube Goldberg clock that uses black and marbles
fired into racing tracks to display the time. Part I:

<h2 id="dodgers-ohtani-got-creative-with-700-million-deal">Dodgers,
Ohtani Got Creative With $700 Million Deal</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PHOENIX, ARIZONA — Once the initial shock wore off on the price tag
of Shohei Ohtani’s record-shattering $700 million, 10-year deal with the
Los Angeles Dodgers, details about the contract emerged that were nearly
as stunning.</p>
<p>A total of $680 million — 97% of the money — was deferred until
2034-43 with no interest.</p>
<p>Had the Dodgers invented some kind of contract voodoo new to Major
League Baseball?</p>
<p>Not really. But it appears to be a team-friendly deal that also has
benefits for Ohtani as the Japanese superstar departs the Angels, heads
30 miles up Interstate 5 and establishes a new home with the Dodgers in
Chavez Ravine.</p>
<p>“Thanks to his endorsements and other off-the-field revenue streams,
he has the luxury to defer compensation,” said Michael Rueda, head of
the U.S. division of sports and entertainment at Withers law firm. “But
there’s always some risk.”</p>
<p>Part of Rueda’s job is giving financial advice to high-profile sports
stars and celebrities. He said the Ohtani-Dodgers deal looks like a
solid arrangement, even if there are tradeoffs for both sides.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, the 29-year-old Ohtani is a rich man and will be
rich long into the foreseeable future, but money promised later is never
the same as money in hand.</p>
<p>One example of Ohtani’s risk: Former Pittsburgh Penguins superstar
Mario Lemieux was out about $26 million in the 1990s when the franchise
was in financial trouble and couldn’t pay the money it owed the hockey
legend in a deferred deal.</p>
<p>Things eventually worked out. Lemieux converted his deferred salary
into equity with the team, then partnered with Ron Burkle to pull the
club out of bankruptcy. They eventually made a windfall after selling
part of their stake in 2021 — but it’s a reminder that financial
circumstances can change when 20 years pass. The Dodgers were certainly
a fan-drawing juggernaut in 2023, but 2043 doesn’t come for a long time.
L.A., after all, is only 12 years removed from filing for bankruptcy
protection under former owner Frank McCourt.</p>
<p>There’s also at least some risk for the franchise: The New York Mets
famously deferred $5.9 million that slugger Bobby Bonilla was owed in
2000 and — thanks to an 8% interest rate — will end up paying nearly $30
million total in annual installments until 2035.</p>
<p>In contrast, Ohtani’s deferred pay comes with no interest. That’s a
potentially monstrous savings — maybe billions — on a deal that could
have been much more costly. Ohtani’s deal with 8% interest would come
out to nearly $3 billion by 2043.</p>
<p>“It’s interesting to me that the deferred money comes with no
interest, from what I’ve read” Rueda said. “That’s giving up a lot of
money.”</p>
<p>Ohtani’s other potential advantage from the contract is he receives
$680 million of the $700 million after he’s done playing, which means he
might not be living in California, where taxes are relatively high.
Depending on where he lives from 2034-43, that could lead to sizable
savings.</p>
<p>Rueda said there are many variables, particularly if he goes back to
Japan.</p>
<p>“Tax is always a big part,” Rueda said. “The concept of moving to a
different jurisdiction and avoiding the California state tax — yeah,
that could be accurate.”</p>

<p>date: 2023-12-16, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
How do you pirate a social media product though?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Sometimes you face questions that force you to think creatively. How do
you pirate a social media product? What does it mean to pirate something
and what’s “pirateable” in a social media product?
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Online piracy or software piracy is the practice of downloading and
distributing copyrighted works digitally without permission, such as
music or software.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If we’re talking social media, what part of the whole experience is the
pirateable product? Is it the shared content? In that case, pirating is
easy: you grab whatever is shared, you take it out of the platform walls
and you republish it somewhere else. Let’s pirate something now, shall
we?
</p>
<figure class="m-o" data-template="with">
<div class="m-m">
<img class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/pirating-social-media/078df10052-1702734795/threads.jpg" style="aspect-ratio:1000 / 796">
</div>
</figure>
<p>
That right there, is social media content. You’re not consuming it on a
social media platform. Meta will never know you saw that post (tweet?),
your consumption of that content won’t be registered anywhere. I took
it—without permission—and I’m now redistributing it.
</p>
<p>
Or maybe, the real product of a social media platform is not the
content, but the social interactions. And the way you pirate those is by
simply not engaging with the platform. By removing yourself from the
platform you force the social interaction to happen elsewhere—on your
blog, on your personal newsletter, in real life.
</p>
<p>
It’s a silly problem to think about. Silly, but also fun.

House in the Sierra Nevadas Built to Withstand Both Fire and Ice</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-16, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Faulkner Architects have practiced from Truckee, California in the
Sierra Nevada Mountain range for 35 years. The firm’s particular
approach to design takes inspiration from founder Greg Faulkner’s former
work in aircraft design. “Precision is one of the things we’re about,”
Faulkner told me. “I was part of the wing group at Cessna. I drew — by
hand — the wings and all the parts that make up a wing for the Citation
III, the first intercontinental business jet with a low swept wing.” (A
low swept wing improves aerodynamic performance.)
</p>
<p>
Translated to architecture, Faulkner thinks about precision in the
assembly of pieces and parts to accommodate for expansion and
contraction. He also takes direction from the natural shape and form of
the building’s environment to determine materials. “Our work is not just
an idea dreamt up separate from the place,” he said.
</p>
<p>
CAMPout, a Faulkner-designed home located in the Sierra Nevada mountains
just 25 miles from where the 2021 Caldor Fire burned through more than
220,000 acres of woodland and destroyed roughly 1,000 structures,
perfectly embodies that approach. I spoke with Greg about the story
behind the house, designing for fire risk, the virtues of pine. Our
conversation has been edited for length and clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Where is CAMPout house located?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Near Lake Tahoe, at the base of a mountain that used to be a volcano and
is now carved with ski runs. The house is at a high elevation with a lot
of snow and looks south toward that mountain. The house is surrounded by
an alpine forest and is in between the mountain and a former prehistoric
lake with an all-desert bottom. A spring-fed creek runs through the
property.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Tell me about your architectural approach to the house.</strong>
</p>
<p>
For CAMPout, we used unfinished sugar pine trees throughout the
interior. You get the scent of sugar pine, and the wood is soft to
touch. We used it on the interior walls and ceiling.
</p>
<p>
We also used a fire-resistant concrete base to create a continuous
surface materiality — you have boulders outside, concrete inside and
out, and start to get a feeling of inside out, outside in. We wanted to
create a seamless experience, using a singular wood species throughout
the whole house — it’s not about a different experience everywhere. It’s
expedient, and we use what is at hand.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Your Habitable score shows extreme
<a href="https://habitableliving.com/climatecheck/39.27733/-120.1513/9506%20Cloudcroft%20Court,%20Truckee,%20California%2096161,%20United%20States/us?developer=true" target="_blank">fire
risk</a>. Were you aware of this when you built the home? What decisions
did you have to make?</strong>
</p>
<p>
We did plan for fire. The exterior of the house is corten steel,
[otherwise known as weathering steel, which resists corrosion,] and
concrete. There are only these two exterior materials, and both are
fire-resistant. Also, we designed an inner courtyard and glazed the
exterior windows. The roof has a Class A rating, [meaning that it can
withstand intense flames,] and is a combination of heavy plate steel
over a layer of stone to protect from flying embers.
</p>
<p>
In 2021, the Caldor fire came within 25 miles [of the CAMPout property]
and destroyed 1,000 structures nearby. In forest fire terms, that’s
pretty close. Glazing on the interior glass in the courtyard made that
somewhat of a safe room. While the courtyard provided some protection,
it still would’ve been very smoky and best to evacuate.
</p>
<p>
We didn’t have to do too much to create escape routes because there are
two ways out of the community where the house is built, in case one is
blocked.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Habitable doesn’t have a risk factor for snow and Truckee had
<a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/weather/article/sierra-snowfall-all-time-record-17827246.php" target="_blank">record
snowfalls</a> last year. How did CAMPout perform in the snow?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Snow is heavy on a roof. CAMPout house is designed for 175 or 200 pounds
per square foot — that’s one person standing side by side over the whole
roof. But last year we got double that weight in snow; the house had 10
feet of snow stacked on top. We had safety factors built in — we
designed the roof to hold the snow in Swiss tradition because of the
insulation it provides. Still, that’s a lot of snow.
</p>
<p>
The water content of snow varies so much. The roof could take a lot of
light dry snow, but if it’s full of rain, it might not. Last year the
engineer recommended after 5 feet or so to start knocking off the snow.
In case another big storm comes, it would be difficult to remove.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Is there anything you would’ve done differently?</strong>
</p>
<p>
We went back and forth on heating the inner courtyard surface for snow
melting. We chose not to do it for sustainability reasons because it
takes a lot of energy to heat the outdoors. But with these kind of
storms, we might reconsider. Removing snow from the courtyard is
difficult even with drains. They have to snow-blow it out, and with 10
feet of snow on the roof, it’s challenging.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What are your three top takeaways for people living in fire and
extreme snow zones?</strong>
</p>
<p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You have to make the decision that you are not going to have wood on
the exterior of the structure. It’s for more than just fire — building a
wooden house in a forest with such extreme weather conditions, it’s a
recipe for maintenance. It’s like putting a piece of furniture in the
woods and expecting it to survive! You have to look for other materials
that can’t burn and don’t need refinishing.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Simple forms are best. Complex roof forms and shapes based on
aesthetics are difficult to waterproof. Think of 10 feet of snow moving
around on the roof. As temperatures changes, snow melts and freezes
again. If you have a lot of activity going on in the roof form, it will
be difficult. A simple form will keep snow on the roof as
insulation.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Angled or sloped roofs are not the answer either. What tends to
happen is there is a porch at the bottom that ends up holding the snow,
or the snow slides onto walkways and driveways and where cars and people
and neighbors pass. If you build close to another house, you can’t have
the snow slide off and hit the neighbor’s property. Best to keep snow on
the roof.</li>
</ol>

id="as-holidays-approach-migrants-face-eviction-from-new-york-city-shelters">As
Holidays Approach, Migrants Face Eviction From New York City
Shelters</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — It could be a cold, grim New Year for thousands of migrant
families living in New York City’s emergency shelter system. With winter
setting in, they are being told they need to clear out, with no
guarantee they’ll be given a bed elsewhere.</p>
<p>Homeless migrants and their children were limited to 60 days in city
housing under an order issued in October by Mayor Eric Adams, a move the
Democrat says is necessary to relieve a shelter system overwhelmed by
asylum-seekers crossing the southern U.S. border.</p>
<p>That clock is now ticking down for people like Karina Obando, a
38-year-old mother from Ecuador who has been given until January 5 to
get out of the former hotel where she has been staying with her two
young children.</p>
<p>Where she will end up next is unclear. After that date, she can
reapply for admission to the shelter system. A placement might not
happen right away. Her family could wind up getting sent to one of the
city’s huge tent shelters far from where her 11-year-old son goes to
school.</p>
<p>“I told my son, ‘Take advantage. Enjoy the hotel because we have a
roof right now,’” Obando said in Spanish outside Row NYC, a towering,
1,300-room hotel the city converted into a shelter for migrants in the
heart of the theater district. “Because they’re going to send us away
and we’re going to be sleeping on the train, or on the street.”</p>
<p>A handful of cities across the U.S. dealing with an influx of
homeless migrants have imposed their own limits on shelter stays, citing
a variety of reasons, including spiraling costs, a lack of space and a
desire to put pressure on people to either find housing on their own, or
leave town entirely.</p>
<p>Chicago imposed a 60-day shelter limit last month and is poised to
start evicting people in early January. In Massachusetts, Gov. Maura
Healey, a Democrat, has capped the number of migrant families in
emergency shelters at 7,500.</p>
<p>Denver had limited migrant families to 37 days but paused the policy
this month in recognition of winter’s onset. Single adults are limited
to 14 days.</p>
<p>In New York, the first families were expected to reach their 60-day
limits just days after Christmas, but the mayor’s office said those
migrants will receive extensions through early January. Roughly 3,500
families have been issued notices so far.</p>
<p>Unlike most other big cities, New York has a decades-old “right to
shelter” obligating the city to provide emergency housing to anyone who
asks.</p>
<p>But officials have warned migrants there is no guarantee they will
get to stay in the same hotel, or the same city borough, for that
matter.</p>
<p>Adult migrants without children are already subject to a shorter
limit on shelter stays: 30 days.</p>
<p>Those who get kicked out and still want help are told to head for the
city’s so-called “reticketing center” that opened in late October in a
former Catholic school in Manhattan’s East Village.</p>
<p>Dozens of men and women, many with their luggage and other belongings
in tow, line up every morning in freezing weather where they must
petition for a renewed stay.</p>
<p>They are offered a free, one-way ticket to anywhere in the world.
Most people decline.</p>
<p>Some are able to secure another shelter for 30 days, but many others
say they leave empty-handed and must line up again the next day to try
their luck.</p>
<p>“I’m scared of dying, sleeping on the street,” Barbara Coromoto
Monzon Peña, a 22-year-old from Venezuela, said as she spent a second
day waiting in line on a recent weekday.</p>
<p>Obando said her eldest son, who is 19, hasn’t been able to find a
place to rent since he and his wife exhausted their 30 allowed days at
the Row NYC hotel.</p>
<p>“As a mother, it hurts,” she said, breaking down in tears. “He’s
sleeping on the train, on the street, in the cold. He’s in a lot of
pain, and now it’s our turn. They told me that this country was
different, but for me it’s been hell.”</p>
<p>Adams has insisted the city is doing a lot more for migrant families
than almost anywhere else. New York is on track to spend billions of
dollars opening shelters, paying for hotel rooms, buying meals and
offering assistance overcoming bureaucratic hurdles for
asylum-seekers.</p>
<p>The mayor also has warned repeatedly that the city’s resources are
stretched thin, with more than 67,200 migrants still in its care and
many more arriving every week.</p>
<p>“We’re doing everything in our power to treat families as humanely as
possible,” said Kayla Mamelak, a spokesperson for Adams. “We have used
every possible corner of New York City and are quite simply out of good
options.”</p>
<p>She stressed that the administration intends to avoid having families
sleeping on the streets and said there will be an orderly process for
them to request another 60-day stay.</p>
<p>Advocates for immigrants say the end result will still uproot
vulnerable families during the coldest months of the year and disrupt
schooling for new students just settling into classes.</p>
<p>“It’s maybe the most Grinch move, ever,” said Liza Schwartzwald, a
director at the New York Immigrant Coalition. “Sending families with
children out like in the middle of winter right after the holiday season
is just cruel.”</p>
<p>Adams has stressed that migrant children would not be required to
change schools when they move. But some kids could potentially face epic
commutes if they are placed in new shelters far from their current
schools.</p>
<p>Migrant parents say two months simply isn’t enough time to find a
job, get kids settled into childcare or school and save up enough for
rent.</p>
<p>Obando, who arrived in the U.S. three months ago, said that outside
of the odd cleaning job, she has struggled to find consistent work
because there is no one to care for her 3-year-old daughter with her
husband still detained at the border in Arizona.</p>
<p>“It’s not that we Ecuadorians come to take their jobs or that we’re
lazy,” she said. “We’re good workers. More time, that’s all we ask.”</p>
<p>For Ana Vasquez, a 22-year-old from Venezuela who is eight months
pregnant, the situation is more urgent.</p>
<p>Her baby is due in late December, but she has until January 8 to
leave the Row NYC, where she has been staying with her sister and two
young nieces for the past four months.</p>
<p>“They are going to leave me out in the cold,” Vasquez lamented in
Spanish one chilly morning this month outside the hotel. “We don’t have
an escape plan. The situation is difficult, even more so with the
baby.”</p>

<h2 id="petrification-is-the-worst">Petrification is the worst</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-16, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Petrification is the worst
</h1>
<p>
My favourite take is that <em>raise dead</em> (or its reverse,
<em>finger of death</em>) is a fifth level cleric spell in BX, takes a
7th level cleric to cast, which requires 70 000 xp to get to. But
<em>stone to flesh</em> (and its reverse, <em>flesh to stone</em>) is a
sixth level magic-user spell, takes an 11th level magic user to cast
them, which requires 600 000 xp to get to. So petrification is way
worse.
</p>
<p>
Also, since the stone can be turned to flesh and presumably the same
person emerges, that means that you cannot resurrect them any other way.
No paladin in hell, no devil in paradise, no fancy raise dead spell can
reach you when you’re petrified at the bottom of the deepest ocean. The
soul remains trapped in the stone.
</p>
<p>
And what if you break off the head? Distribute the parts? Grind it to
dust? When is the soul truly free of that mortal, petrified husk?
</p>
<p>
Always be petrifying the evil dudes.
</p>
<p>
In our games, it has always been harder to find friendly level 11
magic-users than friendly level 7 clerics. Perhaps that is something to
consider as well. And without the magic-users, are scrolls for sale? Not
in my games…

Google, the reason for removing Usenet support is the declining
popularity of Usenet, claiming that “much of the content being

Google Groups does not support, as well as spam”. I can’t validate that

Burns’ Could Aid Forests in US Southeast, Experts Say</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WEST END, N.C. — Jesse Wimberley burns the woods with neighbors.</p>
<p>Using new tools to revive an old communal tradition, they set fire to
wiregrasses and forest debris with a drip torch, corralling embers with
leaf blowers.</p>
<p>Wimberley, 65, gathers groups across eight North Carolina counties to
starve future wildfires by lighting leaf litter ablaze. The burns clear
space for longleaf pine, a tree species whose seeds won’t sprout on
undergrowth blocking bare soil. Since 2016, the fourth-generation burner
has fueled a burgeoning movement to formalize these volunteer ranks.</p>
<p>Prescribed burn associations are proving key to conservationists’
efforts to restore a longleaf pine range forming the backbone of forest
ecology in the American Southeast. Volunteer teams, many working private
land where participants reside or make a living, are filling service and
knowledge gaps one blaze at a time.</p>
<p>Prescribed fire, the intentional burning replicating natural fires
crucial for forest health, requires more hands than experts can supply.
In North Carolina, the practice sometimes ends with a barbecue.</p>
<p>“Southerners like coming together and doing things and helping each
other and having some food,” Wimberley said. “Fire is not something you
do by yourself.”</p>
<p>More than 100 associations exist throughout 18 states, according to
North Carolina State University researchers, and the Southeast is a hot
spot for new ones. Wimberley’s Sandhills Prescribed Burn Association is
considered the region’s first, and the group reports having helped up to
500 people clear land or learn how to do it themselves.</p>
<p>The proliferation follows federal officials’ push in the past century
to suppress forest fires. The policy sought to protect the expanding
footprint of private homes and interrupted fire cycles that accompanied
longleaf evolution, which Indigenous people and early settlers simulated
through targeted burns.</p>
<p>“Fire is medicine and it heals the land. It’s also medicine for our
people,” said Courtney Steed, outreach coordinator for the Sandhills
Prescribed Burn Association and a Lumbee Tribe member. “It’s putting us
back in touch with our traditions.”</p>
<p>The longleaf pine ecosystem spans just 3% of the 360,000 square
kilometers it encompassed before industrialization and urbanization. But
some pockets remain, from Virginia to Texas to Florida. The system’s
greenery still harbors the bobwhite quail and other declining species.
The conifers are especially resistant to droughts, a hazard growing more
common and more severe due to climate change.</p>
<p>A big tent of environmentalists, hunters, nonprofit groups and
government agencies recently celebrated a 53% increase in the longleaf
pine range since 2009, spanning an estimated 20,000 square kilometers.
However, those strides fell short of their goal to hit 32,000 square
kilometers.</p>
<p>Private landowners are central to the coalition’s latest restoration
effort. They hold roughly 86% of forested land in the South, according
to America’s Longleaf Restoration Initiative.</p>
<p>The partnership needs thousands of new landowners to support longleaf
management on their properties. The nascent burn associations are vital
in their education, according to a 15-year plan released in
November.</p>
<p>Federal agencies back the endeavor through activities such as
invasive species removal and land management workshops. Nearly $50
million in federal grants are available for projects bolstering forest
health, including prescribed fire.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture has a “Longleaf Pine Initiative”
partnering with burn groups like Wimberley’s. Farm bill money supports
planning and planting. Personnel can help install firebreaks.</p>
<p>But applicants are increasingly competing for limited funding that
cannot cover all the needed maintenance burns, USDA spokesperson Matthew
Vandersande said.</p>
<p>Landowners say liability-concerned states are reluctant to send their
relatively few burners onto private property and private contractors
cannot meet the demand.</p>
<p>“When it comes time to drop the match, you’re kind of on your own,”
said Keith Tribble, 62, who owns a North Carolina tree farm.</p>
<p>While state forestry services provide classes, Tribble credits burn
associations for the hands-on experience and crews needed to confidently
manage the pines.</p>
<p>Humidity and wind speed are the biggest factors in a burn plan,
according to Hitchcock Woods Superintendent Bennett Tucker, manager of a
private forest in South Carolina. The pine’s oils allow it to almost
always carry fire and he typically burns at a relative humidity between
25% and 50%.</p>
<p>“With a prescribed fire, we can control the where, the when, the how
and all those factors by choosing the best conditions,” Tucker said.</p>
<p>Handheld weather meters ensure wind speed, temperature and humidity
fall within limits under plans written beforehand. The prescriptions
also can reduce potential liability in the event a fire escapes. Runaway
fires are rare, according to studies of federal agencies and surveys of
community burn groups. Wimberley’s teams haven’t had one yet, even with
40 burns per year.</p>
<p>Climate change is reducing the number of safe burn days. Rising
temperatures cause lower relative humidity in the South and intensify
periods when it’s too dry, said Jennifer Fawcett, a North Carolina State
University wildland fire expert.</p>
<p>As the severity and frequency of storms, droughts and wildfires
increase, longleaf pines could become even more important for ecological
resilience in the South. Deep roots anchor them during strong winds and
stretch far into the ground for water. Flames enhance soil
nutrients.</p>
<p>Further, the surrounding ecosystems have few known rivals for
biodiversity in the U.S. Light pours through open canopies onto the
sparse floor, giving way to flora like an insect-eating plant that needs
sun exposure and wet soil. Gopher tortoises feed on the native
vegetation and dig up to 4.5-meter burrows sheltering other at-risk
species.</p>
<p>“It’s more than just planting trees,” said Lisa Lord, The Longleaf
Alliance conservation programs director. “We want to take the time to
restore all of the values of the forest.”</p>
<p>A late 1920s education campaign known as the “Dixie Crusaders” harmed
those interdependent relationships. Federal officials turned southerners
against the practice and burning fell off. Flammable needles and
wiregrasses piled up to dangerous tinder levels.</p>
<p>Wimberley’s family resisted, knowing their livelihoods depended on
fire. His ancestors first applied it to “sweat” out the pine’s lucrative
sap distilled into turpentine or exported as sealants. Later generations
burned to shield crops.</p>
<p>Burning looks different from the times Wimberley’s mother dragged
kindling known as “fat lighter” through the forest. But public
understanding of its importance is returning and the ranks are
growing.</p>
<p>“We’re all a bunch of pyromaniacs,” said Tribble, the tree farm
owner.</p>
<p>Still, Tribble burns for a reason: he values connecting with people
and the land.</p>
<p>Before his burns, brush cluttered the ground, choking waterflow to
parts of the property that were “bone dry.” Now water runs from more
marshy areas and the squeaky call of the rarely spotted red-cockaded
woodpecker resounds from mature pines. Wild turkeys appear when smoke
fills the sky.</p>
<p>Steed, the Lumbee outreach coordinator, is heartened by the
rekindling of this proactive “fire culture” beyond the tribe that she
says introduced it to the region.</p>
<p>She ran through her grandfather’s scorched woods as a child, but the
expanse has gone about a decade without fire. Steed plans to lead her
first burn next year in Wimberley’s woods and then manage a family
property she recently inherited.</p>
<p>“It feels empowering,” Steed said of prescribed fire. “It feels like
a very tangible way to connect to the past and also guide the
future.”</p>

Extends Ban on Oil and Gas Leasing Around Area Sacred to Native
Americans</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — New oil and natural gas leasing will be
prohibited on state land surrounding Chaco Culture National Historical
Park, an area sacred to Native Americans, for the next 20 years under an
executive order by New Mexico Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia
Richard.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s order extends a temporary moratorium that she put in
place when she took office in 2019. It covers more than 293 square
kilometers of state trust land in what is a sprawling checkerboard of
private, state, federal and tribal holdings in northwestern New
Mexico.</p>
<p>The U.S. government last year adopted its own 20-year moratorium on
new oil, gas and mineral leasing around Chaco, following a push by
pueblos and other Southwestern tribal nations that have cultural ties to
the high desert region.</p>
<p>Garcia Richard said during a virtual meeting Thursday with Native
American leaders and advocates that the goal is to stop the encroachment
of development on Chaco and the tens of thousands of acres beyond the
park’s boundaries that have yet to be surveyed.</p>
<p>“The greater Chaco landscape is one of the most special places in the
world, and it would be foolish not to do everything in our power to
protect it,” she said in a statement following the meeting.</p>
<p>Cordelia Hooee, the lieutenant governor of Zuni Pueblo, called it a
historic day. She said tribal leaders throughout the region continue to
pray for more permanent protections through congressional action.</p>
<p>“Chaco Canyon and the greater Chaco region play an important role in
the history, religion and culture of the Zuni people and other pueblo
people as well,” she said. “Our shared cultural landscapes must be
protected into perpetuity, for our survival as Indigenous people is tied
to them.”</p>
<p>The tribal significance of Chaco is evident in songs, prayers and
oral histories, and pueblo leaders said some people still make
pilgrimages to the area, which includes desert plains, rolling hills
dotted with piñon and juniper and sandstone canyons carved by eons of
wind and water erosion.</p>
<p>A World Heritage site, Chaco Culture National Historical Park is
thought to be the center of what was once a hub of Indigenous
civilization. Within park boundaries are the towering remains of stone
structures built centuries ago by the region’s first inhabitants, and
ancient roads and related sites are scattered further out.</p>
<p>The executive order follows a tribal summit in Washington last week
at which federal officials vowed to continue consultation efforts to
ensure Native American leaders have more of a seat at the table when
land management decisions affect culturally significant areas. New
guidance for federal agencies also was recently published to help with
the effort.</p>
<p>The New Mexico State Land Office is not required to have formal
consultations with tribes, but agency officials said they have been
working with tribal leaders over the last five years and hope to craft a
formal policy that can be used by future administrations.</p>
<p>The pueblos recently completed an ethnographic study of the region
for the U.S. Interior Department that they hope can be used for
decision-making at the federal level.</p>

id="arizonas-national-guard-to-help-with-migrant-influx-at-border">Arizona’s
National Guard to Help With Migrant Influx at Border</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PHOENIX — Arizona’s governor on Friday ordered the state’s National
Guard to the border with Mexico to help federal officials manage an
influx of migrants.</p>
<p>Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs said she issued the executive order
because “the federal government is refusing to do its job to secure our
border and keep our communities safe.”</p>
<p>“I am taking action where the federal government won’t,” Hobbs
said.</p>
<p>It was unclear when the troops would arrive at the border and exactly
how many would be mobilized.</p>
<p>Hobbs asked President Joe Biden’s administration a week ago to
mobilize 243 Arizona National Guard troops already in the Border
Patrol’s Tucson sector that includes Lukeville, Arizona, to help federal
officers reopen the border crossing that was indefinitely closed
December 4.</p>
<p>Customs and Border Protection has said shutting down the official
crossing was necessary to allow personnel stationed there to help Border
Patrol agents manage the hundreds of migrants illegally crossing in that
area daily.</p>
<p>Although remote, the crossing is a popular route for Arizonans
traveling to the Mexican resort of Puerto Peñasco, or Rocky Point, about
100 kilometers south of the border on the northern shores of the Sea of
Cortez.</p>
<p>Hobbs said the National Guard members will be stationed at multiple
locations along the southern border, including around Lukeville.</p>
<p>There, they will support state and local agencies engaged in law
enforcement, including interdiction of illegal drugs and human
trafficking.</p>
<p>The San Miguel crossing located farther east on the Tohono O’odham
Nation is also seeing hundreds of migrant arrivals daily, but tribal
officials said the National Guard would not be stationed on the
reservation.</p>
<p>“We are in close communication with Governor Hobbs on this issue,”
said Verlon Jose, chairman of the Tohono O’odham Nation. “We made clear
that no National Guard would be deployed to the Nation and her office
has agreed. Today’s action by the Governor is a necessary step in
addressing the current crisis at the border.”</p>
<p>Hobbs said the Biden administration had not responded to her request
that the U.S. government reimburse Arizona for border security
spending.</p>
<p>Customs and Border Protection officials said they did not have an
immediate response to the governor’s decision.</p>
<p>The Arizona Department of Emergency and Military Affairs, National
Guard confirmed Friday afternoon it was activating members.</p>
<p>Major Gen. Kerry L. Muehlenbeck, who oversees the Arizona National
Guard, noted that in September it wrapped up a 30-month active-duty
mission providing support to law enforcement agencies in southern
Arizona.</p>
<p>Muehlenbeck said the earlier mission provided logistics,
administrative, cyber, and medical support.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva, who represents southern Arizona, said he
disagreed with Hobbs’ executive order.</p>
<p>“But I do appreciate that Governor Hobbs has rejected the brutal and
cruel tactics of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Texas Governor Greg
Abbott who have taken advantage of this crisis to inhumanely and
illegally use migrants as political pawns and to politicize and pander
instead of working on real solutions,” Grijalva said in a statement.</p>

Vital to Relations With China, US Ambassador Says</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S.-China relationship will be defined by strategic
competition in the coming decades but must involve engagement when the
interests of the two countries align, the U.S. ambassador to China said
Friday, one month after President Joe Biden met with Chinese President
Xi Jinping to stabilize the fraught relations.</p>
<p>Nicholas Burns said the U.S. and China are “vying for global power as
well as regional power” as they compete militarily, politically and
economically.</p>
<p>“I think we are systematic rivals, if you think about our national
security and economic and political interests around the world,” Burns
said at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.</p>
<p>In the Indo-Pacific region, China “wishes to be the strongest power,”
Burns said. </p>
<p>“China has a very different view of global governance and the future
of the liberal order,” he said. “And of course, we are attached to a
liberal order because it speaks to our values and our interests, and we
think this is the best order of the world.”</p>
<p>Yet, the two countries need to work together on issues such as
climate change, narcotics, global health and food security, he said.</p>
<p>“No person in their right mind should want this relationship to end
up in conflict or in war,” he said. “So we’re going to develop a
relationship where we can compete, but, as the president says, to
compete responsibly, drive down the probability of a conflict and bring
our people together in a balanced relationship is one way to do
that.”</p>
<p>Washington is recalibrating its relationship with Beijing after
several years of tumult that began with the imposition of tariffs on
Chinese goods under the Trump administration. Ties further deteriorated
over the COVID-19 pandemic and military tensions in the South China Sea
and in the Taiwan Strait.</p>
<p>Last month, Biden met with Xi in Woodside, California, on the
sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. The two
leaders vowed to stabilize relations and agreed to combat illegal
fentanyl and reestablish military communications.</p>
<p>Burns said China had begun shutting down some of the black market for
fentanyl precursors, but the test would be whether the effort would
continue. The ambassador said the resumption of military communications
was important because the two militaries were operating “in very close
proximity to each other” in the South China and East China seas, and
communications could help prevent any crisis from getting out of
control.</p>
<p>But differences on economic competition and global security
remain. </p>
<p>On Thursday night, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told the
U.S.-China Business Council the Biden administration seeks to strengthen
relationships with like-minded nations but also has established economic
working groups with China to exchange information.</p>
<p>The Biden administration has kept the tariffs slapped on some Chinese
goods by the previous administration and has tightened export controls
and investments in high-tech areas such as advanced chips.</p>
<p>Xi also sent a letter to the business council, urging the group and
its members to “build more bridges for friendly exchange” and expand
cooperation. He vowed to build a better business environment in
China.</p>
<p>“The Chinese-style modernization will create more opportunities for
global businesses including U.S. companies,” Xi’s letter said.</p>
<p>China’s economy slowed in the third quarter, as global demand for its
exports faltered and the ailing property sector sank deeper into
crisis.</p>

Americans Sue Biden Administration Over Relatives Stuck in Gaza</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Two Palestinian American families have sued the Biden
administration, saying the government has not done as much to evacuate
their U.S. relatives stuck in Gaza as it did for Israeli dual
nationals. </p>
<p>In the days after Hamas’ October 7 assault in southern Israel, the
U.S. government organized charter flights from Tel Aviv to Europe to
help Americans leave Israel after many airlines canceled service to the
country.  </p>
<p>The State Department says it has helped around 1,300 U.S.
Palestinians leave Gaza and escape Israel’s retaliatory bombardment — in
part by coordinating their exit to neighboring Egypt with Israeli and
Egyptian authorities. </p>
<p>But the United States has not taken steps to organize dedicated
flights or otherwise help secure the exit of an estimated 900 U.S.
citizens, residents and family members who remain trapped in Gaza, the
American families suing the government say.  </p>
<p>They say this violates their constitutional rights.  </p>
<p>“There is more that the U.S. government can do, and they are choosing
not to do it for Palestinians,” Yasmeen Elagha, who has family stuck in
Gaza and helped organize the lawsuit, said in an interview.  </p>
<p>The State Department declined to comment on pending litigation, but a
spokesperson said the department is working to get more Americans and
family members out of Gaza. The White House referred questions on the
lawsuit to the Justice Department, which did not immediately
comment. </p>
<p>Hamas militants killed 1,200 people in Israeli border communities
with Gaza and took 240 hostages during their October 7 assault,
according to Israeli tallies.</p>
<p>Since then, Israeli bombardment has killed nearly 19,000
Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials. According to U.N.
estimates, up to 85% of the 2.3 million people in the densely populated
enclave have been displaced from their homes.  </p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Indianapolis,
accuses the federal government of failing to protect U.S. citizens in an
active war zone and denying equal protection to Palestinian Americans, a
right under the U.S. Constitution. </p>
<p>The suit seeks to force the government to begin evacuation efforts
and secure the safety of its citizens “on equal terms to other
noncombatants in the same war zone.” </p>
<p>Two of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit are Elagha’s cousins, Borak
Alagha and Hashem Alagha, U.S. citizens who were studying engineering in
the Palestinian coastal enclave.  </p>
<p>Americans listed by the United States as wanting to leave Gaza at the
Egyptian-controlled Rafah crossing must be approved by both Israel and
Egypt. </p>
<p>The three Americans cited in the lawsuit have not been cleared to
leave, said Elagha, who lives near Chicago.  </p>
<p>Maria Kari, a lawyer with the Arab American Civil Rights League who
represents the plaintiffs, said her organization filed about 40 lawsuits
in the first month of the conflict on behalf of Palestinian dual
nationals.  </p>
<p>“We’re simply asking the Biden administration to do something it
already did for a class of citizens in the same war,” she said.</p>
