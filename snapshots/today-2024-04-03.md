## I want all the information

date: 2024-04-03, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/08/08/bootstrappingByEngelbart.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I want all the information about the products I make to be instantly available to anyone who wants to know, in exactly the form they want it. Until ChatGPT, that was a totally unattainable dream. But now, for many topics, it's reality. For example, if I have a question about CSS, and believe me, I do -- if I can ask the question clearly enough, I can get a clear and complete explanation of why the browser did the crazy thing with layout that it did. It means I could do something beautiful and refined like the blogroll I worked on in February and March, and the UI stuff I'm working on in March and April. </p>
<p>I can't wait until ChatGPT can answer all those questions about my stuff. But then people who make music don't want their songs to be available the same way. As someone who wants to know as much as possible about songs I have always loved but had no idea how they were made, or what they meant to the writer, knowledge about the work is equally valuable as understanding technical topics. I think the big difference is knowing that life is short, and if we want to leave something behind of ourselves, having the information be available is a blessing, not something to fight against. I don't see why software designers in the future should have to reinvent what my generation has already figured out. I don't want them to have to. It keeps coming back to this one idea -- to solve the problems we have as a species we're going to have to <i>work together, </i>and part of that means not being so guarded and selfish about sharing what we've learned. </p>
<p>We had this problem with music before, with Napster. The users of music, such as myself, found that the ability to program our own music was so liberating. To listen to a song a few times before moving on made a huge difference, or to choose a song to hear because we just thought of it for the first time in 30 years. But we were literally mocked by music promoters and artists. But ultimately, like it or not, the users got the power they wanted. It's got to happen that way too for ChatGPT et al. I guess some people must've felt that search engines were going to rob creative people of control of their creations. I guess this is something we always have to go through. </p>

## 2024-04-03 Return to the office? Never!

date: 2024-04-03, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-04-03-return-to-the-office-never">2024-04-03 Return to the office? Never!</h1>

<p><a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@rdonoghue" title="@rdonoghue@dice.camp">@rdonoghue</a> wondered (mostly ironically, I suspect) about a correlation between the length of the commute and a propensity to favour Return To the Office (RTO) policies.</p>

<p>I used to walk 35min to the office and I still prefer the home office.</p>

<p>Based on what I saw during lockdown and based on what my wife tells me, I think more interesting options are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you have kids at home and prefer Return To the Office? (if older)</li>
<li>Do you have parents at home and prefer Return To the Office? (if younger)</li>
<li>Do you manage a team but don&rsquo;t talk to team members individually and prefer Return To the Office because you can overhear them talk? (if project manager)</li>
<li>Do you have a need for sycophants surrounding you and prefer Return To the Office so you keep an eye on them? (ugh)</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are more options but those seemed to be the obvious ones.</p>

<p>In all fairness:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you have a hard time with focus and prefer the Home Office so that you&rsquo;re not exposed to noise, cross-talk and other distractions by coworkers? (me)</li>
</ul>

## Chinese state, social media echo Russian propaganda on concert hall attack

date: 2024-04-03, from: VOA News USA

Taipei, Taiwan — Specious theories designed to implicate Ukraine and the United States in connection with the late March terror attack in Russia are spreading on China’s state media outlets and on its heavily censored social media platform Weibo.


False claims that paint Kyiv and Washington as masterminds of the attack have fueled debate in Russia even after Islamic State-Khorasan — also known as IS, IS-K, ISIS and Daesh — claimed responsibility for killing at least 143 people and injuring nearly 200 at the Crocus City Hall music venue in suburban Moscow.


In China, an editorial in the state-run Global Times insinuated that “many observers linked the incident to the ‘hybrid war’ form of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.”


“Some Western thinkers have begun to speculate whether Washington had played a role in this terrorist attack,” it said without elaborating.


Without citing names or clear attribution, the Global Times repeated Russia’s false accusations that the U.S. failed to share “key intelligence” that could have helped Russian security services prevent the attack.


In fact, the U.S. warned the Russian authorities two weeks before the attack and shared appropriate intelligence, as it would do “for any other country,” John Kirby, White House national security communications adviser, told VOA.




“We provided useful, we believe, valuable information about what we thought was an imminent terrorist attack,” Kirby said. “We also warned Americans about staying away from public places like concert halls. So, we were very direct with our Russian counterparts appropriately to make sure that they had as much useful information as possible.”


Addressing a Russian intelligence agency board meeting three days before the attack, Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed the U.S. warning as “outright blackmail” intended “to intimidate and destabilize our society.”


The Global Times also criticized Washington for being “slow to condemn the incident in a timely manner, which shocked the international community.”


In fact, the United States was among the first nations to condemn the Moscow attack, and on March 30, U.S. Ambassador to Russia Lynne Tracy placed flowers at the site.




With the Chinese Communist Party’s tight censorship of online content, contrarian views are quickly taken down, and the lack of independent media leave disinformation spread by state-controlled news outlets unchallenged.


Some, however, have voiced skepticism.


“I personally think it’s unlikely that the United States was behind this terrorist attack,” Jin Canrong, a scholar of international relations with an established “anti-American” reputation, wrote on Weibo.


The comments by Jin, who is a professor at the Renmin University of China, provoked heated reaction, with some Weibo users accusing him of being a U.S. sympathizer.


Since the attack, conspiracy theories echoing Russian propaganda have dominated the narrative on Weibo, typically boosted by anonymous pro-Russian and pro-Chinese influencers with millions of followers.


Weibo influencer Drunk Rabbit posted to his nearly half a million followers: “It is no wonder that the Russian people do not believe that this was done by IS. They all firmly believe that Ukraine and its masters who are at war with Russia planned and carried out this atrocity.”


To prove the point, the user posted two side-by-side video clips showing former U.S. Presidents Barak Obama and Donald Trump.


Drunk Rabbit​’s caption read: “Obama: ‘We trained ISIS,’” and “Trump: ‘Obama was the founder of ISIS.’”


“Both former presidents have confirmed that the United States is the creator of ISIS,” Drunk Rabbit continued. “Regarding the terrorist attack on the Moscow Concert Hall in Russia, what other evidence is needed?”


The quotes by Obama and Trump, however, are taken out of context and, in the case of Obama’s remarks, twisted to mean the opposite of what he said.


Trump’s claim has been debunked by fact-checkers and terrorism experts who traced Islamic State’s roots to 2002, six years before Obama was elected president, and Trump himself walked the remark back, calling it “sarcasm.”


It is not out of character for the Chinese state and social media to echo Russian propaganda and disinformation, especially when it targets the United States.

Snowpack is California’s largest source of stored water, so if it’s low in April – as it has been in recent years following historic droughts – residents know they should brace for water shortages in the summer months to come. On the flipside, if the snowpack is way above average, as it was last year, there’s a chance of flooding. But this year, levels are at about 110%, or just above average. Still, Governor Gavin Newsom wants residents to be mindful of their water use because “this time next year, we might be in a different place.” He said the state is preparing for a near-term future in which climate change will make water even more scarce, and is considering options like desalination and water recycling. Here is a look at how 2015 snowpack (top) compares to this year’s snowpack (bottom):

## The financial wisdom of having multiple generations under one roof

date: 2024-04-03, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Multigenerational living arrangements began to decline in the 1950s, thanks to the growth of suburbs, new job opportunities for those willing to move and the rise of senior housing. Yet from 1971 to 2021, the number of people living in multigenerational family households quadrupled. Why? Housing affordability plays a big role. But first: How might Taiwan&#8217;s major earthquake impact the global supply chain for semiconductor chips?</p>

## How Stability AI’s founder tanked his billion-dollar startup

date: 2024-04-03, from: OS News

It was Stability’s armada of GPUs, the wildly powerful and equally expensive chips undergirding AI, that were so taxing the company’s finances. Hosted by AWS, they had long been one of Mostaque’s bragging points; he often touted them as one of the world’s 10 largest supercomputers. They were responsible for helping Stability’s researchers build and maintain one of the top AI image generators, as well as break important new ground on generative audio, video and 3D models. “Undeniably, Stability has continued to ship a lot of models,” said one former employee. “They may not have profited off of it, but the broader ecosystem benefitted in a huge, huge way.” But the costs associated with so much compute were now threatening to sink the company. According to an internal October financial forecast seen by Forbes, Stability was on track to spend $99 million on compute in 2023. It noted as well that Stability was “underpaying AWS bills for July (by $1M)” and “not planning to pay AWS at the end of October for August usage ($7M).” Then there were the September and October bills, plus $1 million owed to Google Cloud and $600,000 to GPU cloud data center CoreWeave. (Amazon, Google and CoreWeave declined to comment.) ↫ Kenrick Cai and Iain Martin As a Dutch person, I can smell a popping bubble from a mile away, even if tulipmania is most likely anti-Dutch British propaganda. In all seriousness, there&#8217;s definitely signs that the insane energy and compute costs of artificial image and video generation in particular are rising at such an insane pace it&#8217;s simply unsustainable for the popularity of these tools to just keep rising. Eventually someone&#8217;s going to have to pay, and I wonder just how much regular people are willing to pay for this kind of stuff.

## Amazon’s ‘Just Walk Out’ checkout system consisted of 1000 people in India watching you shop

date: 2024-04-03, from: OS News

Amazon is phasing out its checkout-less grocery stores with “Just Walk Out” technology, first reported by The Information Tuesday. The company’s senior vice president of grocery stores says they’re moving away from Just Walk Out, which relied on cameras and sensors to track what people were leaving the store with. Just over half of Amazon Fresh stores are equipped with Just Walk Out. The technology allows customers to skip checkout altogether by scanning a QR code when they enter the store. Though it seemed completely automated, Just Walk Out relied on more than 1,000 people in India watching and labeling videos to ensure accurate checkouts. The cashiers were simply moved off-site, and they watched you as you shopped. ↫ Maxwell Zeff Behind every Silicon Valley innovation are underpaid poor people.

## The rise and fall of 3M’s floppy disk

date: 2024-04-03, from: OS News

Even with that said, those gray-hairs will frequently claim that of the many makers of floppies out there, 3M made the best ones. Given that, I was curious to figure out exactly why 3M became the most memorable brand in data storage during the formative days of computing, and why it abandoned the product. ↫ Ernie Smith I do not remember if I ever held any particular views on which brand of floppy disk (or diskettes, as we called them) was the best. We had a wide variety of brands, and I can&#8217;t recall any one of them being better than the other, but then, I&#8217;m sure people in professional settings had more experience with the little black squares and thus developed all kinds of feelings about them.

## The Super Bowl for Meteorologists

date: 2024-04-03, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTg3NzY5My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxMzcyODA4Mn0.KThx9buWt8INTfS2zFuoGjhmST8FMUJNnZ_m_v4MB-s/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">On December 14, 2020, at a little past 1 p.m., meteorologist Matthew Cappucci sat down in the middle of a random field near the Chilean-Argentinian border and cried because it was cloudy. </p>
<p>“To say I was devastated would be an understatement,” he told me.</p>
<p>Cappucci had traveled from his home in Washington, D.C., to Pucón, Chile, to experience a total solar eclipse, only to be denied by an atmospheric river. Under normal circumstances, he could have driven into Argentina, where there were clear skies on the other side of the Andes, but COVID travel restrictions were still in place and the border was closed. His long months of planning and excitement, all dashed by a couple last-minute rain clouds.</p>
<p>All that is to say, Cappucci understands better than most the importance of making an immaculate eclipse-day forecast. In less than a week, millions of Americans will flood the 115-mile-wide, 15-state-long path of totality for the country’s last total solar eclipse until 2044. As they do so, they’ll be relying on the predictions of local and national meteorologists like Cappucci, an atmospheric scientist at <a href="https://business.myradar.com/eclipse/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MyRadar</a> and the Capitol Weather Gang. “I will say that I’ve never personally been more stressed about an event, nor been looking forward to something as much,” Cappucci told me.</p>
<p>Weather teams across the country have been preparing for April 8, 2024, since as early as 2017, when the last American total solar eclipse occurred. There was a noticeable giddiness among the meteorologists I spoke to; it’s fairly unusual for the public to have a high level of interest in a forecast that <em>isn’t</em> potentially life-threatening. “It’ll be really fun to get to be out there and not have to be in a raincoat or have things flying through the air,” Alex Wilson, an on-air meteorologist at The Weather Channel, joked to me.</p>
<p>But as Cappucci alluded to, there is also an elevated sense of responsibility. Every local weather website in or near the path of totality I checked last week already had information about the eclipse-day forecast on its homepage. National publications like <em>The Washington Post</em>, meanwhile, are publishing new <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/01/02/total-solar-eclipse-path-april/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explainers</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/03/29/cloud-cover-eclipse-forecast-maps-cities/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">live maps</a>, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/03/31/total-solar-eclipse-america/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opinion pieces</a> daily in the lead-up to the event. Wilson told me The Weather Channel will have “a bunch of teams” stationed from Texas all the way along the path of totality to Maine; she’ll personally be on hand in Dallas for the station’s Celestron telescope <a href="https://www.astronomy.com/observing/celestron-partners-with-astronomy-for-major-eclipse-event/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">live stream from Love Field</a>.</p>
<p>Cappucci and the rest of the small MyRadar team are also planning to head to Texas for their coverage, which is shaping up to include <a href="https://business.myradar.com/eclipse/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a live stream</a> and <a href="https://x.com/MyRadarWX/status/1774624242941739340?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an “Eclipse Week” package</a> that started Monday. (The company has also been giving away MyRadar-branded eclipse glasses in the lead-up to the event.) This time, Cappucci has thought of everything; he even has a StarLink subscription to ensure that the team can maintain internet connectivity if it ends up reporting from a remote corner of the state.</p>
<p>Fox Weather, meanwhile, has 120 meteorologists under its national, regional, and local umbrella, and has been planning <a href="https://www.foxweather.com/live" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">its own solar eclipse package</a> since October’s <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/news/2023/9/28/the-science-of-solar-eclipses-and-how-to-watch-with-nasa/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">annular eclipse</a> over Texas. The finer details were still coming together last week when I spoke to Fox meteorologist Stephen Morgan, who is based in New York City and will be anchoring from Dallas. But at a minimum, the network plans to have correspondents on air in 10 cities along the path of totality, stretching from Eagle Pass on the Mexican border to Burlington, Vermont. “We’re excited,” Morgan told me, “but I think the elephant in the room is the fact that this is happening in the month of April, which is a very tough month when it comes to forecasting.”</p>
<p>Joe Rao, a longtime television meteorologist and an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_chasing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">umbraphile</a> who has seen 13 total solar eclipses, was even more blunt when I asked him what local weather teams would be grappling with this week. “Out of the 12 months of the year, April is probably the worst month to have an eclipse,” he told me.</p>
<p>April is a transitional month in North America, seasonally-speaking. It is a time when severe weather begins to ramp up; it’s <a href="https://www.foxweather.com/weather-news/april-begins-severe-weather-threat" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the second busiest</a> month for tornadoes. The continent’s <a href="https://eclipsophile.com/2024tse/#:~:text=April%E2%80%99s%20major%20storm%20tracks%20across%20the%20continent" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">three major west-to-east storm paths</a> also become more active. And in places like Texas, which experts said would have <a href="https://eclipsophile.com/2024tse/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the best chance of anywhere in the nation</a> for clear skies on eclipse day, you can still get a south wind that brings moisture off the Gulf of Mexico, giving clouds a chance to develop. </p>
<p>Houston-based Fox meteorologist Aaron Barker is keenly aware of this. He’s been sharing radar models for Central Texas <a href="https://x.com/weatherbarker/status/1775191926599192691?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on Twitter</a> and, as of now, the region is looking pretty dicey for cloud cover next week. Like Morgan and Cappucci, though, he said the pressure to get this particular forecast right is intense. “It’s obviously less serious than a hurricane or something like that, but the importance of the forecast for a lot of people is still very, very high,” he told me. </p>
<p>Ironically, that’s also part of the problem; because of the danger of storms like hurricanes and tornadoes, we’ve gotten pretty good at seeing them coming. “The science has improved remarkably over the years trying to hone in on those threats, but cloud cover — my word. That’s a tough one,” Morgan said. Clouds alone aren’t usually a life or death situation. But for people spending hundreds or thousands of dollars to chase a rare celestial phenomenon, the stakes can start to <em>feel</em> that high. </p>
<p>Cappucci gets it: “I’ve done a million kajillion tornadoes, hurricanes, the Northern Lights, the whole nine yards,” he said. “Simply nothing compares to a total solar eclipse.” As he explained, the “most important thing” you can see during an eclipse is the corona — the silvery atmosphere of the sun visible around the moon that “looks like the hairs of an angel because they’re glowing and radiating out into space.” To see it, though, you need clear skies. “Even some high cirrus clouds — yeah, they’re a nuisance, but you can still see some stuff,” Cappucci went on. “But to get overcast rain is really a showstopper.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that’s precisely what Barker has been seeing on his radar models for most of Texas, and local meteorology teams in Dallas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas have begun to dampen expectations. Wilson, the Weather Channel meteorologist, admitted that she’s a little “nervous” while cautioning that it’s still early for such predictions. Meanwhile, upstate New York and Vermont, which have the worst records of clear skies this time of year, are shaping up to have the best show in the country. </p>
<p>Rao, the longtime eclipse-chaser, has only been clouded out at two of his 13 experiences. (If you believe in luck, note that he plans to watch this one somewhere upstate.) He has <a href="https://www.space.com/what-if-it-is-cloudy-for-total-solar-eclipse-april-8-2024" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tried to calm some of the panic</a> around the possibility of cloud cover, explaining to me that “it’s not like you’re not going to experience anything” if the sky is overcast on April 8. During one of his cloud-outs, at his first eclipse in Quebec in 1972, he watched the sky go from “battleship gray to weird colorations of saffron and pink. At one point, it was like I was looking at the clouds through the inside of a beer bottle or an iodine bottle.”</p>
<p>Of course, pretty clouds are just consolation; everyone wants perfect viewing conditions. The National Weather Service has even started to post <a href="https://x.com/NWSWPC/status/1774862804463538444?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a little jingle</a> alongside its daily cloud-cover updates: “Totality or bust, check the forecast and adjust!” The meteorologists I spoke to universally agreed that they won’t start to put too much stock in the cloud models until Wednesday or Thursday at the earliest. </p>
<p>Wilson said she personally won’t feel confident in the hourly models until at least three or four days out, and even then, you never really know. It was overcast when she was covering the annular eclipse in San Antonio in October and “everybody was kind of freaking out. Then, about 20 minutes before eclipse time, it cleared out.”</p>
<p>That is the annoying truth of modern meteorology: Not even the best computers, radars, <a href="https://heatmap.news/culture/old-farmers-almanac-climate-change" target="_self">almanacs</a>, or atmospheric scientists can predict whether a stray cloud will wander in front of the sun in the minutes before totality.</p>
<p>“I’m just really hoping that April doesn’t do April things and that weather-wise, it cooperates,” Morgan said. “But April is full of surprises — and clouds.”</p>

## 2024-04-01 What’s the plan?

date: 2024-04-03, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-04-01-what-s-the-plan">2024-04-01 What’s the plan?</h1>

<p><a class="account" href="https://mastodon.sdf.org/@Shufei" title="@Shufei@mastodon.sdf.org">@Shufei</a> asks what we&rsquo;ll do with all the billionaires if we survive the next decade, the next century. Like I said in that post about Israel and Palestine, it&rsquo;s worth imagining positive outcomes and then think about the intermediate steps. So, assuming we make it, what happened?</p>

<p>I think the long term change we would need is <a href="2024-04-03-tax">extremely high taxes</a> as a an explicit redistribution mechanism. We&rsquo;ll look back and say, &ldquo;during Late State Capitalism we nearly ended the planet but then we manage to curb inequality and raised inheritance tax to 80%, the max income tax bracket to 90% and the two-digit million wealth tax to 20%.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The goal would be a society with salaries between 50k and 200k per year and family, and wealth worth one year of salary. Health insurance paid for by taxes. Retirement homes paid for by taxes. Pensions paid for by immediate redistribution (i.e., taxes) instead of investments.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://mastodon.sdf.org/@Shufei" title="@Shufei@mastodon.sdf.org">@Shufei</a> commented on this and mentioned land reform:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rentierism in all facets has virtually no restraints in most of the world.  That is sometimes <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of capital which a family could have put to family resiliency, instead going to landlords and investment epiphenomina like gentrification.  I’m not sure oldschool petite bourgeois distributionism (landed yeomanry) is the big answer there, but under a “permanent jubilee” it might be workable enough to eliminate the scourge of landlordism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m not quite sure what the plan is, though.</p>

<p>For urban planning it seems to be state-sponsored coop housing. As soon as the percentage of sponsored housing goes up, the other rents go down, while still leaving the option of more generous housing being built. This is a lesson that was somewhat forgotten in Zürich for a few decades and that seems to explain a lot about the high rents, here.</p>

<p>For agriculture, what seems to have worked in Switzerland (still not enough but a lot better than in the European Union) is protectionism, direct payment, zoning laws, government fixed pricing on agricultural land, etc. not a single thing but a whole set of interlocking mechanisms. And there is still room for improvement. But I’d defer to groups active in food sovereignty to better answer that question, I guess.
Maybe <a href="https://viacampesina.org/">Via Campesina</a> has a plan, for example.</p>

<p><a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org">@Sandra</a> just posted two links, one discussing alternatives and one where she looks for the elements of the solution. Let&rsquo;s talk about them.</p>

<p><a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/alternatives">Alternatives</a> argues for market socialism, as I read it. In a subsequent comment on fedi she disagreed with this take and said that it was by far the weakest alternative. But I&rsquo;m not so sure. Planned economy doesn&rsquo;t work; small nudges is what we have and it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be working either; and the last option seems to be &ldquo;utopias and sundry&rdquo;. That doesn&rsquo;t sound promising, either. I still think that in the given list, market socialism doesn&rsquo;t sound bad at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Worker-owned cooperatives that trade with each other on a market. That’s it. That’s the whole plan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then again, none of the alternatives seem pretty strong.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also not sure how market socialism would work in a global environment. How would we deal with local bad harvests and war? It&rsquo;s biggest benefit seems to be that it promises incremental improvements. No bloody revolution necessary. And that&rsquo;s already a plus.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A big upside of this track is that it’s somewhat compatible with the other systems and with present-day market capitalism. This means that it can be implemented piecemeal wherever it make sense and I think that’s awesome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/solution">My best guess at a climate solution</a> is where Sandra ends with a call to regain influence in the media.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Making changes in our own lives is great (eat plants) but ideally we’d want politicians (and their overlords: mass media) to sober up and implement policies to steer industry and the rich.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here in Switzerland (and elsewhere), the fascists like to complain about left-wing media and fight them and defund them until they have them under their thumb (remember Berlusconi&rsquo;s media take-over in Italy). So we need to fight them all the way: Decry their meddling and scheming and increase the funding. Demand that they drop the airhead programming and bring back material that helps lift people up, not drag them down. Education and information is key.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a media person, so I don&rsquo;t know how to do it. All I can say is that music programs that have interesting discussions surrounding the music work well for me. Podcasts work for me. Series seem to work for some. Just drop the quiz shows and reality-TV and all that order material that only serves to distract.</p>

<p>I guess that in my heart of hearts I feel that humanity’s main problem is sociopaths. These people are always there and they love their person gain and don’t feel other people’s pain. Therefore, the struggle is eternal. There is no solidification, no solution that will hold for generations. Every generation will have to fight this fight. All I can say is that it&rsquo;s a mistake to let a generation grow up in the belief that politics is not important, that struggle isn&rsquo;t necessary, or that the end of history has come.</p>

<p>That is never going to be true.</p>

## 2024-04-03 We need more taxes

date: 2024-04-03, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-04-03-we-need-more-taxes">2024-04-03 We need more taxes</h1>

<p>I recently wondered about <a href="2024-04-01-the-plan">our plan</a> for dealing with the rich.
A key part is increased taxation.</p>

<p>Whenever I hear talk about the state crumbling (and since my wife works for the federal government in Switzerland I hear plenty of that), the first thing many people think is that the fault lies with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_budget_amendment">balanced budget amendment</a> (&ldquo;Schuldenbremse&rdquo;). And indeed, that is the obvious cause for many of the problems.</p>

<p>Arguing about the balanced budget amendment is doomed, however. Most people don&rsquo;t understand the difference between household economics and state economics. A much simpler solution exists, one that everybody understands: <strong>INCREASE TAXES FFS!</strong></p>

<p>Now I know why countries like Switzerland don&rsquo;t like to increase taxes: Where would all the oligarchs go? Where would all the great holdings go? And within Switzerland, same thing: as soon as one canton dropped inheritance tax they all feared that the rich would move elsewhere and started dropping their inheritance taxes. And now <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erbschaftssteuer_in_der_Schweiz">there is practically none</a>, for descendants. Wealth can stay in the family, like in the good old days of feudalism.</p>

<p>Next up: Fighting tax evasion, fighting the free movement of capital, fighting for a global tax (do not follow the Swiss model of malevolent compliance!), and more. The fighting just never stops, I know. 😩</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_tax">Progressive taxation</a> is great. The more you own and make, the more you can afford to support the public good. Pay proportionally more!</p>

<p>Taxes are great for redistribution of wealth. We don&rsquo;t need to argue about Universal Basic Income (I support it!) or new subsidies or anything else like that: We can simply use existing mechanisms to redistribute wealth, reducing that Gini coefficient, increasing happiness, increasing the feeling of living in a fair and just society, increasing the feeling that work can get you to the top.</p>

<p>Taxes are great to fight inflation, too! If the state hands out more money in a time of crisis, that excess money has to be taken back via taxes. This keeps the money flowing (and only money flowing is what counts). Of course you don&rsquo;t want to bring it back via asocial taxation schemes like a fixed per-head tax, or a VAT, but something like progressive income tax or progressive wealth tax.</p>

<p>This makes sense, even in broken system like ours: COVID money for everybody, everybody is squeezed by landlords and industry, then tax the rich to get the money back. Virtuous cycle!</p>

## NATO foreign ministers to discuss proposed military fund for Ukraine

date: 2024-04-03, from: VOA News USA

STATE DEPARTMENT — NATO foreign ministers meeting Wednesday in Brussels are expected to discuss a proposal to create a $100 billion fund for supporting Ukraine’s military.


The plan, put forward by NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, also includes making NATO more directly involved in coordinating military assistance being provided by member countries, a role that has been filled by a U.S.-led coalition of more than 50 countries.


Stoltenberg told reporters Wednesday it is important that support for Ukraine be less dependent on voluntary, short-term offers and more dependent on longer-term NATO commitments.  He said Ukrainian commanders would be better able to make battlefield plans with more predictable support.


Stoltenberg said the plan would also send a message to Russia that it cannot win by keeping the war going long enough that Ukraine’s allies tire of providing support.


“Ukraine has urgent needs,” Stoltenberg said.  “Any delay in providing support has consequences on the battlefield as we speak.”


A final decision on the proposal would not come until NATO heads of state meet at a summit in July.


Ahead of the Brussels talks, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken renewed calls for the U.S. Congress to release military aid for Ukraine.


“We are at a critical moment where it is absolutely essential to get Ukrainians what they continue to need to defend themselves, particularly when it comes to munitions and air defenses,” Blinken said Tuesday during a visit to a defense facility in Paris with French Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu.


Congress is yet to approve the Biden administration’s supplementary budget request that would provide aid to resupply Ukraine’s armed forces and help the country fend off Russian offensives.


Biden has called on the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives to approve the military and financial aid package. House Republicans have delayed action on it for months, prioritizing domestic issues.


Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned that Ukrainian forces will have to retreat “step by step, in small steps,” if Kyiv doesn’t receive the U.S. military aid.


French Foreign Minister Séjourné was in Beijing earlier this week. He said after a meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi that France expects China to convey "clear messages" to its close partner Russia regarding Moscow’s actions in Ukraine.


France and China have sought to strengthen ties in recent years. Chinese President Xi Jinping is planning a visit to France in May.


During meetings in Paris in February, Wang told French President Macron that Beijing appreciated his country's "independent" stance. But Paris has also sought to press Beijing on its close ties with Moscow, which have only grown closer since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.


U.S. and French officials said they are working closely to effectively prevent the transfer of weapons and materials to Russia from North Korea and China, which could fuel Moscow’s defense industrial base.

Almost six months have passed since President Joe Biden asked Congress to appropriate money for Ukraine in a national security supplemental bill. At first, House Republicans said they would not pass such a bill without border security. Then, when a bipartisan group of senators actually produced a border security provision for the national security bill, they killed it, under orders from former president Trump.

## Exiled Chinese businessman Guo Wengui must face US fraud indictment

date: 2024-04-03, from: VOA News USA

new york — A U.S. judge on Tuesday rejected exiled Chinese businessman Guo Wengui's bid to dismiss an indictment accusing him of defrauding thousands of investors out of more than $1 billion. 


U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres in Manhattan said prosecutors sufficiently alleged that Guo engaged in a pattern of racketeering through four fraud schemes, and that proving it was a matter for trial. 


Lawyers for Guo did not immediately respond to requests for comment after business hours. 


Guo has pleaded not guilty to 12 criminal charges including securities fraud, wire fraud, unlawful monetary transactions and conspiracy, including for money laundering. 


According to the indictment, Guo and his accomplices defrauded investors in a media company, cryptocurrency and other ventures. 


The indictment said Guo took advantage of his prolific online presence and hundreds of thousands of followers by promising outsized financial returns and other benefits. 


In reality, the scheme allowed the co-conspirators to enrich themselves and family members and fund Guo's "extravagant lifestyle," the indictment said. 


Two co-defendants face related criminal charges, and one defendant is charged with obstruction. 


Also known as Ho Wan Kwok and Miles Kwok, Guo is a critic of China's Communist Party and a business associate of former U.S. President Donald Trump's onetime adviser Steve Bannon. 


Guo has been jailed in Brooklyn, a borough in New York City, since his March 2023 arrest, with Torres and a federal appeals court rejecting his proposed $25 million bail package last year. 


Jury selection in his trial is scheduled to begin on May 20. 


Prosecutors also sought the forfeiture of various assets, including bank accounts, a $37 million yacht, a New Jersey mansion, a Bugatti, a Lamborghini and a Rolls Royce. 


Guo filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Connecticut in February 2022. That case was later combined with the bankruptcies of other companies he controlled. Torres has twice rejected Guo's bid to stay the bankruptcy proceedings.

## Service provider for immigrants in detention ordered to pay $811M+ in lawsuit

date: 2024-04-03, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — A company that provides services for immigrants in federal detention was ordered Tuesday to pay more than $811 million in restitution and penalties in a lawsuit alleging it used deceptive and abusive tactics.


Nexus Services must pay roughly $231 million in restitution as well as penalties of $13.8 million to New York, $7.1 million to Virginia and $3.4 million to Massachusetts, according to a judgment filed in federal court for the Western District of Virginia in Harrisonburg. The Virginia-based company, its subsidiary Libre by Nexus and its three executives must also each pay more than $111 million in civil penalties.


"This judgment is a victory for thousands of immigrant families who lost their life savings and were targeted and preyed on by Libre," New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. "Libre exploited vulnerable immigrants and their families to pad its pockets, and that is illegal and unconscionable."


James joined state attorneys general in Virginia and Massachusetts and the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in a 2021 lawsuit that accused the company of violating state and federal consumer protection laws.


The officials said the company promised to secure immigrants' release on bond while their immigration claims were being processed but concealed and misrepresented the true nature and costs of its services. They said the company collected thousands of dollars in fees above the face value of the bonds and forced immigrants to wear painful ankle monitors.


U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Dillon noted in her decision that the company isn't a licensed bail bond agent or a surety company certified by the U.S. Treasury but a "service provider that acts as an intermediary between immigration detainees and sureties and their bond agents."


The company said in a statement that it intends to appeal the judgment, calling it a "shocking departure from normal American jurisprudence" as it was decided "without evidence, without a trial and without a damages hearing."


"We continue to remain committed to serving our clients — people who suffer and sacrifice for a better life, and who do not deserve to be political pawns in an American legislature or an American courtroom," the company added.

The blogroll code includes the CSS for the Bootstrap Toolkit. I use it as if it were part of the OS, but not everyone does, and it changes the global values of things. So when you install it on a page that has its own ideas how things should work, you can get an unpleasant effect (to put it mildly). So I created a localized <a href="http://scripting.com/code/blogroll/smallbootstrap.css">subset</a> of Bootstrap's styles, to be a better guest in other people's pages. That is now done. I expect we'll see more of that kind of thing. Web plugins are a new area for me. I guess that's pretty obvious. </p>

## US, Japan eye alliance upgrades during Biden-Kishida meeting

date: 2024-04-02, from: VOA News USA

seoul, south korea — The United States and Japan are considering ways to strengthen military cooperation, with several reports suggesting the alliance could see one of its biggest structural upgrades in several decades. 


The potential changes, meant to better address shared threats such as China and North Korea, will figure prominently when Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida meets U.S. President Joe Biden during a state visit next week in Washington.  


During the visit, U.S. and Japanese officials are expected to agree on a review of the framework that has for decades guided interaction between Japan's Self-Defense Forces and the approximately 54,000 U.S. troops in Japan.  


Specifically, Japan's Kyodo news agency said, the U.S. military will consider ways to strengthen the functions of its command headquarters in Japan amid concerns that the current arrangement would not allow for adequate coordination during a conflict.  


Japan wants the United States to appoint or elevate a four-star commander to oversee U.S. troops in the country. Under the current setup, U.S. Forces Japan is led by a three-star general with little authority over joint operations. That means Japan must coordinate with the U.S. military's Indo-Pacific Command, located more than 6,000 kilometers (3,728 miles) and five time zones away in Hawaii.  


The existing arrangement dates to the 1960s, long before China's massive military buildup and North Korea's acquisition of nuclear weapons upended Asia's security dynamic, prompting Japan to take a much more proactive role in world affairs.  


It is not clear what changes the United States will propose. When asked by VOA about recent reports on the matter, the White House National Security Council declined to comment. Still, the review is being welcomed by many in Japan's defense community who have pushed for greater integration between the two countries' forces.  


"This is a very significant step for the alliance," said Tetsuo Kotani, senior fellow at the Japan Institute of International Affairs. "By upgrading our command and control relationship, we are actually preparing for war fighting together, so that the two militaries can operate together in a time of crisis." 


More assertive Japan 


Until recently, it was difficult to imagine Japan becoming involved in a major conflict. The country has a technically pacifist constitution, which was drafted by the U.S. following Tokyo's defeat in World War II.  


But in recent years, Japan has loosened some of its self-imposed military restraints, allowing it to become a major player in regional and global security.  


Most notably, Japan intends to increase its annual defense spending to 2% of its gross domestic product (GDP), up from the traditional 1%, by 2027. This will likely give Japan the world's third-largest military budget, behind the United States and China.  


For the first time, Japan also will deploy missiles that can hit military targets in other countries. In January, Japan signed a deal with the U.S. to purchase up to 400 Tomahawk cruise missiles. 


The acquisition has created further urgency for military integration, according to analysts, who note that Japan would rely on the United States for targeting information, damage assessment and escalation management if the missiles were used.  


Naoko Aoki, an associate political scientist at the RAND Corporation, said Japan's increased defense capabilities also necessitate greater cooperation with South Korea, another U.S. ally, which hosts about 28,500 U.S. troops. 


"Because if Japan were to use this [counter strike capability] against North Korea, for example, then clearly coordination among the three countries would become very, very important," she said.  


To allow for smoother integration among its own forces, Japan recently announced plans to establish a joint operations headquarters by 2025. The move was also widely discussed as a possible catalyst toward greater integration with U.S. forces.  


How to proceed 


The U.S. military has not released details about any possible changes to its command structure in Japan. However, media reports point to several possibilities.  


Last week, Reuters reported that Washington will consider appointing a four-star commander, as Tokyo has requested, though it is not clear what responsibilities the position would be given. 


Some analysts say the appointment of a U.S. four-star general may be too controversial in Japan, because it would be widely seen as a possible precursor to the type of unified command that exists in South Korea, where a U.S. four-star general would control both U.S. and South Korean troops during wartime. 


"A four-star general in Japan sounds like too much at this moment," said Kotani. Instead, he thinks the U.S. could establish some type of joint coordination center to facilitate greater interaction with the Japanese military.  


A similar idea was mentioned as a possibility last week by the Financial Times. According to the British newspaper, the task force would be attached to the Hawaii-based U.S. Pacific Fleet but would shift to Japan "over time."  


From Tokyo's standpoint, such a proposal is "probably better than nothing," said Jeffrey J. Hall, a Japanese politics specialist at Kanda University of International Studies.  


"It does make sense to have decision-making power shifted to a time zone closer to a potential conflict area," Hall said.  


But, Hall said, U.S. officials are likely to proceed cautiously, perhaps wary of big steps that could spark domestic opposition in Japan, where some are uncomfortable with the idea of Japanese troops being controlled by the United States.  


Kishida is already in a difficult situation at home. The approval rating of his Cabinet remains near record lows amid long-running economic challenges and a political fundraising scandal in his party.  


"For the last year, we've been in a situation where Prime Minister Kishida is incredibly unpopular among Japanese voters but loved by the national security folks in Washington," Hall said.  


For Japan, the question is how to achieve greater military integration while maintaining proper levels of independence, given Japan's constitutional and political restraints, said Aoki. But she maintains that the effort is worthwhile. 


"The command and control architecture … hasn't been changed since the 1960s, but the threat environment has changed greatly," she said. "So, modernizing this will help the credibility of the alliance and help deterrence in the region."

## Biden hosts scaled-down Ramadan events amid Gaza outrage

date: 2024-04-02, from: VOA News USA

washington — President Joe Biden is meeting with American Muslim community leaders on Tuesday amid outrage from Muslim and Arab Americans over his administration's support for Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza.


"Continuing his tradition of honoring the Muslim community during Ramadan, President Biden will host a meeting with Muslim community leaders to discuss issues of importance to the community," a White House official said in a statement sent to VOA.


"He will be joined by Vice President [Kamala] Harris, senior Muslim Administration officials and senior members of his National Security team."


Following the meeting, the official said they will "host a small breaking of the fast, prayer, and Iftar" with "a number" of senior Muslim administration officials.


Unlike in previous years, American Muslim leaders were not included in the White House iftar, or breaking of the fast meal. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the leaders had declined and asked for a "working group meeting" instead.


"They wanted to make sure that there was an opportunity to discuss the issues at hand," she said during her briefing Tuesday in response to a VOA question. "We listened, we heard, and we adjusted the format to be responsive so that we can get feedback from them."


Since taking office, Biden has hosted Muslim community leaders at the White House, a tradition that began with President Bill Clinton in 1996. Except for President Donald Trump in 2017, Republican and Democratic presidents have hosted an iftar dinner during Ramadan or an Eid al-Fitr reception to mark the end of the month of fasting.


Past Ramadan and Eid celebrations usually included diplomats from majority-Muslim countries. Embassies that VOA reached out to said they have not received an invitation this year.


Many decline invitation 


Even with the meeting-only format, many community leaders declined to attend, and Biden will likely meet with only a handful of them.


In a social media post, Muslim advocacy group Emgage Action said they had asked Biden to "postpone this gathering and to convene a proper policy meeting with representatives of the community's choosing rather than those selected by the White House."




The administration "can and should leverage its enormous support for Israel and begin to take demonstrable actions" including to demand an immediate and permanent cease-fire and unfettered access for humanitarian aid," the group said.


"Without more Palestinian voices and policy experts in the room, we do not believe today's meeting will provide for such an opportunity."


Many who have attended White House Ramadan events in the past said they had no idea about the meeting until VOA reached out to them.


"It's probably hand-picked people who have been vetted and who have been guaranteed not to speak up and be critical of the president's policies," said Jawaid Kotwal, board member of the Afghan American Foundation.


Several White House and Biden campaign events around the country have been marred with disruptions by pro-Palestinian protesters. His constituents — including many Muslim and Arab Americans — have signaled their outrage. Hundreds of thousands voted "uncommitted" in Democratic primary elections in various states.


A Pew survey released Tuesday shows that only 36% of American Muslims view Biden positively. The same survey shows that only 6% believe the U.S. is striking the right balance between the Israelis and Palestinians. Sixty percent say Biden favors the Israelis too much.


'A time of mourning, not celebration'


"The American Muslim community has made it very clear they have no interest in breaking bread with President Biden while his administration is enabling the starvation and slaughter of Palestinians in Gaza," Edward Ahmed Mitchell told VOA. Mitchell is deputy executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, also known as CAIR.


As the death toll in Gaza approaches 33,000 people, it's clear that many American Muslims are uncomfortable with the thought of celebrating at the White House.


"This is a time of mourning, not celebration, so we're only accepting iftars that benefit the poor, refugees and the oppressed," Salam Al-Marayati, founder of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, told VOA.


CAIR and other Muslim groups and anti-war organizations are hosting a "People's White House Ceasefire Now Iftar" in front of the White House on Tuesday.


Biden also faces dissent from some administration staff members, particularly those with Arab or Muslim backgrounds, including Tariq Habash, a Palestinian American and former policy adviser at the Department of Education who resigned in protest in January.


The president is "attempting to break bread with Muslim staffers while finalizing the sale of billions of dollars in warplanes to Israel as its extremist government targets humanitarian workers and hospitals," Habash told VOA.


Biden's meeting with American Muslims came amid reports that seven aid workers, including at least one dual-nationality American from the NGO World Central Kitchen, were killed in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza on Monday.


The organization, led by celebrity chef Jose Andres, has been leading the efforts to get food to Gaza via a ship from Cyprus.


Iuliia Iarmolenko, Sayed Aziz Rahman, Yuni Salim and Iram Abbasi contributed to this report.

## Microsoft announces prices for the Windows 10 Extended Security Update program

date: 2024-04-02, from: OS News

Windows 10 is reaching end of support on October 14, 2025, so if you&#8217;re still using Windows 10 &#8211; and let&#8217;s face it, if you&#8217;re somehow forced to still use Windows, better 10 than 11 &#8211; your time is running out. Luckily, end of support is a bit of a nebulous term when it comes to Microsoft products, and many among you, especially those managing larger fleets of systems, will know Microsoft offers something called the Extended Security Update (ESU) program, wherein you get additional security updates even after end of support. Microsoft just unveiled the prices for this program for Windows 10. While there&#8217;s several schemes, the one most of you will be interested in is this one: With the 5-by-5 activation method, you&#8217;ll download an activation key and apply it to individual Windows 10 devices that you&#8217;ve selected for your ESU program. Manage it via scripting or the Volume Activation Management Tool (VAMT), among other methods. You can use on-premises management tools such as Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) with Configuration Manager to download and apply the updates to your Windows 10 devices. The 5-by-5 activation subscription will establish the Year One list price of ESU for Windows 10. This is the base license and will cost $61 USD per device for Year 1, similar to the Windows 7 ESU Year 1 price. ↫ Jason Leznek Honestly, that&#8217;s not an egregious price, but do note that this price doubles every year for three years total, and note that if you want to start using ESU in year two, you&#8217;ll have to pay for year one as well. In other words, pricing ramps up fast. Furthermore, this program only includes security updates &#8211; no new features or anything like that, and it doesn&#8217;t include support either. So, if you&#8217;re still using Windows 10 after October 14, 2025, you&#8217;ll either have to pay up, have an insecure system, downgrade to Windows 11, or move to a better alternative. Choice&#8217;s yours.

## Discord turns to ads

date: 2024-04-02, from: OS News

Quests are a way for players to discover games and earn rewards for playing them on Discord. We started experimenting with them over the last year, and millions of you opted in and completed them. We’ve heard great feedback from developers who partnered with us to create them and from many of you who completed one. If you didn’t see firsthand, the &#8220;May the 4th&#8221; Fortnite Quest is a great example. Now, we’re opening up sponsored Quests to more game developers. ↫ Peter Sellis That&#8217;s a lot of fancy, hip words to say Discord is going to show you ads. I have an odd relationship with Discord &#8211; it holds a special place in my heart because through Discord is how I met my now-wife and mother of our children, so understandably, the chat platform has a special meaning for us. At the same time, though, Discord has been getting steadily worse and less usable over the years, and while my wife isn&#8217;t too bothered by that, I certainly am &#8211; and so we moved our instant messaging over to Signal instead. My wife still uses Discord with her friends. Seeing a platform that used to be quite usable, and easily the best way to manage a group of geographically spread-out friends, fall prey to the same kind of bullshit so many other platforms have succumbed to. Discord today is almost unrecognisable to what it was like 6-7 years ago, and now there&#8217;s even going to be ads &#8211; the final nail in the coffin for the possibility of me ever going back to using it.

date: 2024-04-02, from: Om Malik blog

TLDR: This is a smart move for Yahoo. It didn’t cost them much. I would say that this was cheaper than the “cheap and cheerful” category. Second, it gives Yahoo News a chance to modernize. ** “A lot of organizations care deeply about news and personalized content and I think they’re looking around and saying &#8230;

## What’s Behind Tesla’s Faceplant?

date: 2024-04-02, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTg5OTAyMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2OTg4MTk2MX0.8Fqvd-etnvdogvtDOkSedhgOYpewt7m1-2UQ3Id3-y8/image.jpg?width=593&height=395&coordinates=5%2C290%2C602%2C115"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">The electric vehicle market is anyone’s game. </p><p>That’s the takeaway from this year’s first tranche of EV sales data, which saw the two global market leaders — Tesla and BYD — turn in dismal sales for the first three months of the year. Those were in contrast to other automakers including Rivian, Hyundai, and Toyota, all of which reported healthier numbers. </p><p>Tesla’s deliveries, which Wall Street uses as a decent proxy for sales, came up well short of analysts’ expectations at <a href="https://ir.tesla.com/tesla-vehicle-production-deliveries-and-date-financial-results-webcast-first-quarter-2024" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">386,810 vehicles</a> for the quarter — <a href="https://twitter.com/CoreyBCantor/status/1775154525235487040?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">down about 9%</a> from the first quarter of 2023. Analysts have <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/03/28/tesla-tsla-delivery-estimates-all-over-the-place/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">consistently cut their estimates</a> for this quarter’s deliveries over the past few weeks, but even so, the real numbers came in well below even the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/02/tesla-tsla-q1-2024-vehicle-delivery-and-production-numbers.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lowest expectations</a>. </p><p>“I was a little bit bearish on Tesla for this quarter — and I should’ve been darker,” Corey Cantor, an EV analyst for BloombergNEF, a new-energy research firm, told me. </p><p>But despite those meager results, Tesla edged out BYD on sales for the quarter. The Chinese EV giant — whose new <a href="https://www.theautopian.com/byd-seagull-ev/)." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$9,000 Seagull hatchback</a> has <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ford-gm-stellantis-byd" target="_self">stunned</a> Western automakers and <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/chinese-ev-cars-biden" target="_self">triggered protectionist impulses</a> around the world — reported far less stunning sales data. BYD <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4f1a2188-ced0-4018-998d-5148209a5f5e" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sold 300,114</a> vehicles in the first three months of 2024, down 42% compared to a year before. </p><p>That means Tesla is once again the world’s No. 1 seller of electric vehicles, after ceding that title to BYD last year. But little else is going right for Elon Musk’s car company. </p><p>Tesla has an aging vehicle line-up, and its newest North American offering, the Cybertruck, has <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2024-tesla-cybertruck-review" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not impressed</a> reviewers. By its own admission, the company is struggling to scale up the Cybertruck’s production as well. </p><p>Perhaps most worrying for Musk is that Tesla produced almost 47,000 more vehicles during the first quarter than it sold, suggesting that it is beginning to hit real limits on customer demand for its cars. </p><p>“There must be some kind of supply-demand imbalance here,” Cantor said. Tesla has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-temporarily-slashes-prices-model-y-us-2024-02-10/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">slashed</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/02/business/tesla-fourth-quarter-sales.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">its vehicle prices</a> by thousands of dollars over the past year in order to stimulate demand. Tesla doesn’t break out its sales data by region, which is a shame because that could help clarify what is going on. If Tesla’s sales are flagging in China and Europe, that could be because consumers are flocking to a new set of EV options. A sales decline in the U.S. would indicate that one of the company’s cash cows, the Model Y crossover, is beginning to falter.</p><p>“If you look at this, you can see where there are yellow flags here,” Cantor said. “Tesla can explain it however you want but the numbers speak for themselves. Anytime you’re down 9% year on year is a challenge.”</p><p>It’s harder to know how to read BYD’s fillip. Other Chinese automakers <a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3257483/chinese-carmakers-li-auto-nio-xpeng-and-byd-report-march-sales-rebound-difficulties-are-looming" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> surging March sales. Xiaomi, a Chinese phone maker, has <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68705711" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported almost 90,000 preorders</a> for its first-ever electric car, the SU7. Cantor speculated that the hiccup may be due to Lunar New Year, which tends to depress sales in January and February.</p><p>Elsewhere in the car market, other EV makers did better — although few reported surging sales. One exception was Hyundai, which reported EV sales up <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hyundai-motor-america-reports-all-time-record-march-and-q1-2024-sales-302105571.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than 60%</a> from the first quarter of 2023.</p><p>General Motors’ electric vehicle sales <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-new-vehicle-sales-likely-rose-q1-extend-recent-streak-2024-04-02/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fell 20.5%</a> compared to the first quarter of 2023, even as the company’s overall sales of personal-use vehicles rose slightly. It reported higher sales for the Lyriq, its EV SUV, Cantor said.</p><p>Toyota says that it sold 206,850 “electrified” cars across North America in the first quarter, a gain of 74% over the year before. “Electrified,” however, is a <a href="https://www.toyota.com/electrified-vehicles/" target="_blank">Toyota term of art</a> — it includes conventional hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. About a third of Toyota’s North American sales now fall in this category.</p><p><span></span>The electric truck maker Rivian modestly surpassed expectations, beating both analysts’ and its own estimates with <a href="https://rivian.com/newsroom/article/rivian-releases-q1-2024-production-figures" target="_blank">13,588 deliveries</a> in the first few months of 2024. While its total production of 13,980 vehicles for the quarter came in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/rivian-misses-production-estimates-ev-maker-shifts-new-supply-chain-2024-04-02/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">marginally below predictions</a>, Rivian reaffirmed its earlier estimates for full-year production. </p><p>Even so, by late afternoon, Rivian’s stock was down 5% for the day. That might be partially explained by the <a href="https://riviantrackr.com/news/rivian-factory-shut-down-q2-2024/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">planned weeks-long</a> shutdown of its factory in Normal, Illinois, scheduled to begin at the end of this week. While the pause will allow for renovations designed to reduce costs and increase efficiency, it will also mean that next quarter is guaranteed to be a “wash” for Rivian, Cantor said.</p><p>As of last quarter, Rivian was <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/02/21/rivians-gross-margins-slip-q4-2023-but-more-to-it/" target="_blank">losing about $43,000</a> on every vehicle it produced. Whether it can stem those losses and get on the “<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/rivian-earnings-r2-release" target="_self">bridge to profitability</a>” executives say is within sight remains, apparently, an open question for shareholders. Rivian is now focused on surviving long enough to <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/rivian-suv-r2-r3-r3x" target="_self">sell the R2 SUV</a>. “Every single thing we do within the business is focused on driving costs on this,” RJ Scaringe, Rivian’s CEO, told CNBC last month.</p><p>Tesla's and BYD’s flagging sales may also be signaling to investors that a general EV slowdown is coming. And then, of course, there's the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/ev-electric-vehicle-slowdown-ford-gm-tesla-b20a748e" target="_blank">general malaise</a> that descended over the EV industry in 2023 as the big legacy American automakers reported sluggish sales for their splashy new electric models and planned to scale back production in the coming year. Though the data don’t present as clear a picture as the doomers might suggest, it is undeniable that, as Princeton energy systems professor and Shift Key podcast co-host Jesse Jenkins wrote for Heatmap, “<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/are-ev-sales-really-slowing-data" target="_self">the vibes are bad</a>.”</p><p>“The narrative now will be harsh on Tesla and BYD,” Cantor said. “But if you’re another automaker, you should see this as an opportunity. We’re in the early stages here. None of this is written.”</p>

## Redis’ license change and forking are a mess that everybody can feel bad about

date: 2024-04-02, from: OS News

Redis, a tremendously popular tool for storing data in-memory rather than in a database, recently switched its licensing from an open source BSD license to both a Source Available License and a Server Side Public License (SSPL). The software project and company supporting it were fairly clear in why they did this. Redis CEO Rowan Trollope wrote on March 20 that while Redis and volunteers sponsored the bulk of the project&#8217;s code development, &#8220;the majority of Redis’ commercial sales are channeled through the largest cloud service providers, who commoditize Redis’ investments and its open source community.&#8221; Clarifying a bit, &#8220;cloud service providers hosting Redis offerings will no longer be permitted to use the source code of Redis free of charge.&#8221;  This generated a lot of discussion, blowback, and action. The biggest thing was a fork of the Redis project, Valkey, that is backed by The Linux Foundation and, critically, also Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Oracle, Ericsson, and Snap Inc. Valkey is &#8220;fully open source,&#8221; Linux Foundation execs note, with the kind of BSD-3-Clause license Redis sported until recently. You might note the exception of Microsoft from that list of fork fans. ↫ Kevin Purdy at Ars Technica Moves like this never go down well.

## IndieWeb Carnival: Good enough and the search for perfection

date: 2024-04-02, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>There’s a specific type of beauty that can only be found in the most perfect of creations. Pure shapes, smooth surfaces. Some objects can only be the result of someone not settling for “good enough”.</p>
<p>There’s also another type of beauty, the one Japanese call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi">wabi-sabi</a>, the appreciation of things that are imperfect.</p>
<p>I don’t see these two things as being opposite to each other, but rather complementary. Like everything in life, the creation process is an act of balance.</p>
<p>At times I feel trapped between the two. Every day, whether I’m writing, coding or designing, a part of me strives for perfection while another is painfully aware that perfection is a mirage. What looks perfect now won’t look perfect tomorrow. I grow, I evolve, I change and my definition of perfection evolves with me.</p>
<p>This post won’t be perfect but it’s going to be "good enough". All my posts are. They have to be. Because a perfect post would never get posted. Perfection and the real world are like parallel lines in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_geometry">descriptive geometry </a> whose crossing point can only be found at infinity.</p>
<p>It’s why deadlines are important. It’s why constraints are important. Learning to embrace “good enough” is not easy but it’s a necessary step if you want to achieve anything.</p>

## Building a Foundation for Strategic Stability with China on AI

date: 2024-04-02, updated: 2024-04-02, from: RAND blog

In an atmosphere of deepening mutual suspicion, trying to engage with China on military uses of artificial intelligence may seem pointless. But if negotiations go somewhere, U.S. security might be palpably improved. It they fail, there is little downside.

## US anti-Muslim incidents hit record high in 2023 due to Israel-Gaza war, advocacy group says

date: 2024-04-02, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Reported discrimination and attacks against Muslims and Palestinians reached a record high in the U.S. in 2023, driven by rising Islamophobia and bias as the Israel-Gaza war raged late in the year, data from an advocacy group showed on Tuesday.


Complaints totaled 8,061 in 2023, a 56% rise from the year before and the highest since the Council on American-Islamic Relations began records nearly 30 years ago. About 3,600 of those incidents occurred from October to December, CAIR said.




Human rights advocates have similarly reported a global rise in Islamophobia, anti-Palestinian bias and antisemitism since the latest eruption of conflict in the Middle East.


U.S. incidents have included the fatal October stabbing of 6-year-old Palestinian American Wadea Al-Fayoume in Illinois, the November shooting of three students of Palestinian descent in Vermont and the February stabbing of a Palestinian man in Texas.


CAIR's report said 2023 saw a "resurgence of anti-Muslim hate" after the first ever recorded annual drop in complaints in 2022. In the first nine months of 2023, such incidents averaged around 500 a month before jumping to nearly 1,200 a month in the last quarter.


"The primary force behind this wave of heightened Islamophobia was the escalation of violence in Israel and Palestine in October 2023," the report said.




The most numerous complaints in 2023 were in the categories of immigration and asylum, employment discrimination, hate crimes and education discrimination, CAIR said.


Palestinian Islamist group Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's subsequent military assault on Hamas-governed Gaza has killed over 32,000 people, according to the local health ministry, displaced nearly all its 2.3 million population, put Gaza on the brink of starvation and led to genocide allegations that Israel denies.


CAIR said it compiled the numbers by reviewing public statements and videos as well as reports from public calls, emails and an online complaint system. It contacted people whose incidents were reported in the media.

## xz Utils Backdoor

date: 2024-04-02, updated: 2024-04-02, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>The cybersecurity world got really lucky last week. An intentionally placed backdoor in xz Utils, an open-source compression utility, was pretty much <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4">accidentally discovered</a> by a Microsoft engineer&#8212;weeks before it would have been incorporated into both Debian and Red Hat Linux. From <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/04/what-we-know-about-the-xz-utils-backdoor-that-almost-infected-the-world/">ArsTehnica</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Malicious code added to xz Utils versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 modified the way the software functions. The backdoor manipulated sshd, the executable file used to make remote SSH connections. Anyone in possession of a predetermined encryption key could stash any code of their choice in an SSH login certificate, upload it, and execute it on the backdoored device. No one has actually seen code uploaded, so it&#8217;s not known what code the attacker planned to run. In theory, the code could allow for just about anything, including stealing encryption keys or installing malware...</p></blockquote>

## Blinken urges swift, impartial investigation into Israeli strike that killed aid workers in Gaza

date: 2024-04-02, from: VOA News USA

State Department — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday that the United States has urged Israel to promptly investigate an Israeli airstrike in Gaza that resulted in the deaths of seven humanitarian workers. Blinken reiterated the call for Israel to prioritize the protection of civilian lives.


"We've spoken directly to the Israeli government about this particular incident. We've urged a swift, a thorough and impartial investigation to understand exactly what happened," Blinken said Tuesday during a press conference in Paris.


Humanitarian workers “have to be protected,” Blinken added. “We shouldn't have a situation where people who are simply trying to help their fellow human beings are themselves at grave risk.”




Hours before Blinken's meeting with French Foreign Minister Stephane Séjourné, the charity organization World Central Kitchen, founded by celebrity chef Jose Andres, said that seven of its personnel were killed in the Israeli airstrike in Gaza. The organization declared an immediate halt to its operations in the region.


Séjourné expressed strong condemnation of the airstrike during the joint press conference, saying the situation in Gaza "is disastrous and is worsening day after day. Nothing justifies such a tragedy.”


Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said his government will establish a joint situation room with international groups to facilitate the coordination of aid distribution in Gaza alongside Israeli military operations.




On Monday, France introduced a draft resolution to the United Nations Security Council aimed at exploring options for U.N. oversight of a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip and suggesting ways to help the Palestinian Authority in taking on responsibilities.


Last month, the United States abstained from a vote that permitted the council’s 15 members to demand an immediate cease-fire during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which ends next week.


Ukraine


Blinken also renewed calls for the U.S. Congress to release military aid for Ukraine.


“We are at a critical moment where it is absolutely essential to get Ukrainians what they continue to need to defend themselves, particularly when it comes to munitions and air defenses,” Blinken said during a visit to a defense facility in Paris with French Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu.




Congress is yet to approve the Biden administration’s supplementary budget request that would provide aid to resupply Ukraine’s armed forces and help the country fend off Russian offensives.


Biden has called on the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives to approve the military and financial aid package. House Republicans have delayed action on it for months, prioritizing domestic issues.


Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned that Ukrainian forces will have to retreat “step by step, in small steps,” if Kyiv doesn’t receive the U.S. military aid.


French Foreign Minister Séjourné was in Beijing earlier this week. He said after a meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi that France expects China to convey "clear messages" to its close partner Russia regarding Moscow’s actions in Ukraine.


France and China have sought to strengthen ties in recent years. Chinese President Xi Jinping is planning a visit to France in May.




During meetings in Paris in February, Wang told French President Emmanuel Macron that Beijing appreciated his country's "independent" stance. But Paris has also sought to press Beijing on its close ties with Moscow, which have only grown closer since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.


U.S. and French officials said they are working closely to effectively prevent the transfer of weapons and materials to Russia from North Korea and China, which could fuel Moscow’s defense industrial base.


The top U.S. diplomat is also set to express U.S. support for the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization as he holds talks with UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay.


The United States and France have been among Ukraine’s top supporters in the two years since Russia launched the invasion of its neighbor.


The State Department said efforts to bring stability to Haiti would be another topic on the agenda for the meeting of U.S. and French officials.


Blinken will travel from Paris to Brussels for a meeting of NATO foreign ministers as the alliance celebrates its 75th anniversary.


While in Brussels, Blinken is also scheduled to meet with Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba and NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg.


A three-way meeting of the United States, European Union and Armenia is set for Friday, with the State Department saying the session will focus on “U.S. and EU support for Armenia’s economic resilience as it works to diversify its trade partnerships and address humanitarian needs.”


European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan will lead their respective delegations.


Separate U.S.-EU trade and technology talks will close Blinken’s stop in Belgium.

<p><a href="https://www.sbb.ch/en/travel-information/apps/sbb-mobile.html">SBB Mobile</a> is for the train tables and for buying tickets online. Basically a must-have if you don&rsquo;t have a car.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/swisstopo-application">Swisstopo</a> is for the Swiss maps, my the Swiss <a href="https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/">Federal Office of Topography</a>. ❤️</p>

<p><a href="https://www.schweizmobil.ch/en/switzerlandmobility-app">SwitzerlandMobility</a> is useful because it has the same official maps plus it interfaces with the Swiss Tourism site so all the big hiking tours have descriptions and pictures.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/about-us/get-our-app-and-stay-in-touch-with-switzerland/46766802">SWIplus</a> is the alternative to visiting the <a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/">swissinfo</a> site. No real benefit. News for the Swiss abroad, or conversely, for the foreigners staring back.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.srf.ch/hilfe/website-und-apps/srf-apps">SRF News</a> is the alternative to visiting the <a href="https://www.srf.ch/news">SRF News</a> site. No real benefit, either. News</p>

<p><a href="">Play SRF</a> is the alternative to visiting the national <a href="https://www.srf.ch/play/tv">TV</a> or <a href="https://www.srf.ch/programm/radio/">Radio</a> sites. Useful if you want to look up older stuff. Or listen to an episode of Sounds! without subscribing to the podcast.</p>

<p>In the same vein, there&rsquo;s an app for <a href="https://www.radioswissjazz.ch/">Swiss Jazz</a>, <a href="https://www.radioswissclassic.ch/">Swiss Classic</a> and <a href="https://www.radioswisspop.ch/">Swiss Pop</a> – digital radio stations that just play music, by <a href="https://www.srgssr.ch/en/our-offering">SRG SSR</a>. That is to say, sponsored by the state.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bk.admin.ch/bk/en/home/dokumentation/Swiss-Confederation-brief-guide.html">CH info</a> is the alternative to visiting the <a href="https://ch-info.swiss/">CH Info</a> site. No real benefit, again. Learn the absolute basics about Switzerland&rsquo;s political system, administration and judicial authorities – i.e., the Federal Administration.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/politik/abstimmungen/voteinfo.html">VoteInfo</a> is the alternative to reading all the news about all the elections, votes, referendums and initiatives, all in one place. Pretty interesting every handful of months.</p>

<p><strong>Compendium</strong> is the alternative to visiting the <a href="https://compendium.ch/">Compendium</a> site. No real benefit, I guess. Information about all the medication you can get in Switzerland. I hope you don&rsquo;t need it.
<a class="account" href="https://toot.cafe/@stevegenoud" title="@stevegenoud@toot.cafe">@stevegenoud</a> commented to say that he built <a href="https://dosierungen.com/">Dosierungen</a> as an alternative to Compendium.</p>

<h2 id="travel">Travel</h2>

<p><a href="https://osmand.net/">OsmAnd Maps Travel &amp; Navigate</a> is the Open Street Map (OSM) app that lets me download maps for offline use. Extremely useful for travelling abroad since Switzerland is not in the European Union and therefore roaming is extremely expensive for us and for foreigners in Switzerland… we need to be part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_roaming_regulations">European Union roaming regulations</a>. The user interface is complex with different sets of settings depending on what you want to use the app for, and so it can be endlessly confusing at first. My wife hates it. Just be prepared for that.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.peakfinder.com/">PeakFinder</a> is an app to identify mountain peaks. The older men here in Switzerland pride themselves in knowing all the peaks and the app is my only way of keeping up.</p>

## Biden tells China's Xi to stay out of US elections

date: 2024-04-02, from: VOA News USA

Washington — President Joe Biden again warned Chinese President Xi Jinping against meddling in the November U.S. presidential election during the two leaders’ phone call Tuesday. The call is part of U.S. efforts to maintain “open lines of communication to responsibly manage competition and prevent unintended conflict,” the White House said.


In various engagements, the U.S. has raised its “continual reinforcement of concern” against Chinese election interference, a senior administration official told reporters in a Monday briefing previewing the call.


Biden last raised the issue in his meeting with Xi in Woodside, California, last November. Beijing has repeatedly said it has no interest in meddling in U.S. internal affairs.




“I don't think we ever really take the Chinese at their word when they say they will or will not do something,” the senior administration official said. “It is about verifying.”


A declassified U.S. intelligence threat assessment released in February warned of Beijing’s “higher degree of sophistication in its influence activity,” including by using generative AI. The report warned of “growing efforts to actively exploit perceived U.S. societal divisions” online.


“Spamouflage, a persistent China-linked influence operation, has weaponized U.S. political, economic, and cultural wedge issues in its campaigns,” said Max Lesser, a senior analyst of Emerging Threats at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.


Spamouflage leverages specific issues to target Biden, Lesser told VOA. For example, a post sharing an article from Fox news covering a Pro-Palestinian protest was shared by a Spamouflage account with the added commentary “Biden's defeat is a foregone conclusion.”


Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said in a statement sent to VOA that China is “committed to the principle of non-interference” and that claims about Beijing influencing U.S. presidential elections are “completely fabricated.”




The leaders also reviewed progress on key issues discussed at the Woodside Summit, including counter-narcotics cooperation to curb fentanyl trafficking and the recently re-established military-to-military communication, addressing AI-related risks, and efforts on climate change and people-to-people exchanges, the White House said in its readout of the call.




US-Japan-Philippines trilateral summit


The Biden-Xi call came as the White House prepares for a trilateral summit where Biden will host Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. next week.


The first-ever “minilateral” gathering is set to unveil a series of initiatives including increasing maritime cooperation to counter China’s aggressive behavior in the South China Sea. Beijing claims almost the entirety of the South China Sea, overlapping claims of the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei.


Washington is concerned over the latest flare-up with China stepping up its use of water cannons against Philippine vessels to block a resupply mission to the Second Thomas Shoal. Since 1999, Philippine soldiers have guarded a wrecked ship left on the shoal to maintain the country’s sovereignty claims over the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.


The goal is to make clear to Xi that the U.S. “will not stand idly by if this gray zone coercion continues to escalate and potentially leads to the loss of lives of Filipino sailors,” Gregory Polling told VOA during a Center for Strategic and International Studies briefing Tuesday. Polling directs CSIS’ Southeast Asia Program and Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative.


Grey zone tactics refer to activities and actions between peace and war that fall below the threshold of armed conflict. China’s firing of water cannons is an example of a grey zone action as it falls short of triggering the 1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty.


As Taiwan prepares to inaugurate its new president next month, Biden “emphasized the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait,” said the White House. Beijing considers the self-governed island its wayward province, and cross-strait issues have been one of the sharpest sources of tension in U.S.-China rivalry.


Chinese malicious cyber activity is another key concern. Last month, the U.S. sanctioned China-linked hackers for targeting U.S. critical infrastructure. Wuhan Xiaoruizhi Science and Technology Company, Limited or Wuhan XRZ is a front company for China’s Ministry of State Security that has “served as cover for multiple malicious cyber operations,” the administration said.


The official highlighted continued diplomatic engagement including a visit to China by U.S. Secretary of Treasury Janet Yellen in the coming days and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in the coming weeks. The U.S. and China are also set to hold a dialogue on AI risk management in coming weeks.


The leaders also discussed other regional and global issues, with Biden raising concerns over Bejing’s “support for Russia’s defense industrial base and its impact on European and transatlantic security,” the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and human rights protection in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.


Paris Huang contributed to this report.

## Declassified NSA Newsletters

<blockquote><p>Applied Cryptography, for those who don&#8217;t read the internet news, is a book written by Bruce Schneier last year. According to the jacket, Schneier is a data security expert with a master&#8217;s degree in computer science. According to his followers, he is a hero who has finally brought together the loose threads of cryptography for the general public to understand. Schneier has gathered academic research, internet gossip, and everything he could find on cryptography into one 600-page jumble...</p></blockquote>

The blogroll code includes the CSS for the Bootstrap Toolkit. I use it as if it were part of the OS, but not everyone does, and it changes the global values of things. So when you install it on a page that has its own ideas how things should work, you can get an unpleasant effect (to put it mildly). So I created a localized <a href="http://scripting.com/code/blogroll/smallbootstrap.css">subset</a> of Bootstrap's styles, to be a better guest in other people's pages. That is now done. I expect we'll see more of that kind of thing. Web plugins are a new area for me. I guess that's pretty obvious.

## It's time for our own hero

<blockquote>
There is a surprising amount of respect for people who appear to know nothing about the industry. They’re known as the “left curves.”<br />
<br />
The nickname comes from a popular meme in crypto that shows a bell curve with investors on the left who know nothing, or very little, and those in the fat middle of the curve who know something about crypto. On the right are investors who seemingly know everything.

Why does Shen think those who know nothing about cryptocurrencies are the big winners? Because they are jumping in to yet another <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-21/the-big-winners-of-this-crypto-bull-market-are-the-left-curves">cruptocurrency bubble</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
For example, a crypto project with pseudonymous co-founders including “Smokey The Bera” and “Dev Bear” has become a unicorn after it raised millions of dollars from institutional investors such as Brevan Howard Digital. Another token with no real utility — only a cute picture of a dog wearing a hat — has increased by more than 1,400 times its value from three months ago. A developer of a sloth-themed memecoin called Slerf claimed they accidentally burned a large amount of the tokens after raising $10 million.<br />
<br />
What a great time to be a left curve! In this bull market, forget about highbrow ideas like revamping Wall Street. Give up on dreams of replacing traditional artwork with nonfungible tokens. Instead, don’t overthink it. Just “<a href="https://twitter.com/allnick/status/1770093646768976229">choose rich</a>.”

Well, yes, but the much-desired <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/11/desperately-seeking-retail.html">retail traders</a> don't seem convinced. Even the mania around spot Bitcoin ETS has died down, as the chart shows. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-21/the-big-winners-of-this-crypto-bull-market-are-the-left-curves">Shen writes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
How did this happen? How did crypto’s greatest comeback take place so fast, so hilariously and — at times — so stupidly? Why did crypto evangelists give up their dreams? At its core, it’s because the market is still living under the shadows of past catastrophes like FTX’s collapse and TerraUSD’s blowup.<br />
<br />
In the past bull markets, when Bitcoin went up, everything else went up amid small-scale rotations between major and small-cap coins. But in this bull market, the rotation is more severe: As Solana went up in the past month, the price of Ether went down dramatically — a simple piece of evidence that shows there’s less money being thrown at the crypto market today than three years ago.
</blockquote>
The "past catastrophes like FTX’s collapse and TerraUSD’s blowup" may be old news but to their victims they aren't even close to over. The best FTX's creditors can hope for is to get back what their HODL-ings were worth <i>before</i> Bitcoin took off moon-wards, and who knows when that might happen.<br />
<br />
Kevin T. Dugan's <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html"><i>The Crypto World Has a New Villain</i></a> starts with the story of one victim of yet another "past catastrophe":<br />
<blockquote>
"I had no idea who Barry Silbert was or anything until after November 16, 2022," Eric Asquith told me. That date was when he was pretty sure he had lost his family’s savings of $1,052,000.
</blockquote>
Asquith wasn't on the Left Curve but just a bit <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html">left of the middle</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
He didn’t buy bitcoin or other meme tokens. Instead, earlier that year, he moved over cash from his business — just a little at first, then more — and converted it into digital currencies he thought were as good as cash. The digital coins were called GUSD, and each was worth exactly $1 because the company that minted them — <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/12/how-the-winkleviis-second-act-in-bitcoin-went-bad.html">Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss’s crypto exchange, Gemini</a> — backed each one with real money and assets.
</blockquote>
But Asquith's GUSD were deposited into Gemini's Earn program to get its 5.5% interest, far more than banks were paying. But Asquith and the other Earn depositors were far enough left on the curve that they didn't know Earn <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html">wasn't like a bank savings account</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
What Asquith did not fully understand was that his money was no longer with Gemini. In one sense, Genesis, a crypto company owned by Barry Silbert had it, but even that wasn’t quite true. Soon-to-collapse hedge funds with names like Three Arrows Capital and Alameda Research — Sam Bankman-Fried’s personal fund — were quietly borrowing from Silbert’s shop. Asquith’s money, and that of tens of thousands of others, was being used by SBF and others to make giant bets on some of the highest-flying, most volatile digital tokens.
</blockquote>
Then Terra/Luna collapsed and things started to fall apart. Amy Castor and David Gerard <a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2022/11/25/crypto-collapse-ftx-first-day-hearing-genesis-screws-dcg-silvergate-bank/">reported</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
One of Genesis’s biggest customers was Three Arrows Capital (3AC), who they’d lent $2.4 billion. After 3AC blew up in May, DCG assumed $1.2 billion of the liabilities to keep the hit off Genesis’ books. Genesis had been the single largest creditor of 3AC.<br />
<br />
Genesis also had money on FTX. As FTX was falling apart, Genesis tweeted on November 8 that they had no exposure, and it was fine. Two days later, Genesis admitted they had “~$175M in locked funds in our FTX trading account,” and they were not fine.<br />
<br />
Genesis scrambled to find more capital. Genesis and DCG needed $1 billion in emergency credit by 10 a.m. EST on November 14, but didn’t get it. Even Binance turned them down.<br />
<br />
So two days later, Genesis suspended withdrawals,<br />
...<br />
One of Genesis’s biggest customers is Gemini Trust, run by the Winklevoss twins, that operated its own “yield” program, Gemini Earn, for retail investors.<br />
<br />
Gemini was supposed to be the safe exchange — but it was exposed to risks via Genesis. There’s now $700 million that Gemini Earn customers can’t withdraw — because it’s stuck on Genesis.
</blockquote>
Gemini <a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2023/01/12/crypto-collapse-dcgs-check-kiting-comes-home-to-roost-nexo-raided-voyager-sale-to-binance-progresses-unbanking-the-banked/">tried to get the cash</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
On January 8, Gemini terminated the Master Loan Agreement with Genesis and emailed customers accordingly. This “requires Genesis to return all outstanding assets in the program.” Genesis did not return the funds by the end of January 10 — so they were officially in default on the loan. At this point, Genesis can pull the pin and try to put Gemini into involuntary bankruptcy.
</blockquote>
They did, and there followed a year of legal wrangling between Gemini, Genesis and Barry Silbert's Digital Currency Group, which owns Genesis. The <a href="https://amycastor.com/2023/01/13/sec-sues-genesis-and-gemini-genesis-owes-3-billion-to-creditors/">SEC sued both Gemini and Genesis</a>, and so did <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html">the New York Attorney General</a>.
While the wrangling continued, another of the semi-regular cryptocurrency bull markets took off until <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html">in February 2024</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
the victims, Silbert’s now-bankrupt crypto-lending operation, the Winklevoss twins, and regulators hammered out a deal to pay everybody back in full. The crypto bull market of 2024 made it possible to pay back Earn customers not some fraction of what they invested but the generally much higher sum of what their holdings would now be worth.
</blockquote>
Everyone started <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html">cele:wbrating</a>;<br />
<blockquote>
Except there was Silbert. Earn victims who had been unfamiliar with him would soon learn that he had made his first fortune by studying the ins and outs of the bankruptcy system and using it to his financial advantage. Since February, the billionaire investor has been relying on a controversial interpretation of bankruptcy law to stop Asquith and all the other victims from getting the bigger payout, the one based on current prices. Instead, to simplify a bit, he would prefer to keep that money himself. “DCG cannot support a plan that not only deprives DCG of its corporate governance rights but also violates United States bankruptcy code,” a spokeswoman for the company said.<br />
<br />
The victims have taken to calling it “the Barry Trade”: If Silbert is successful, he would be able to pocket as much as $1 billion in funds that would otherwise be returned to them. At the very least, Silbert may substantially delay the money being returned to Earn customers.<br />
...<br />
Silbert’s legal logic is that the bankruptcy code sets a date to value victims’ claims in U.S. dollars, and in Genesis’ case, it just happened to be around the market’s lows. 
</blockquote>
People started <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/genesis-and-gemini-winklevoss-twins-crypto-firms-charged-by-sec">talking to the press about Gemini</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Former Gemini employees told The Beast that Gemini Earn’s terms and conditions were highly dubious from the outset. One staffer recalled reading the fine print for the first time, saying, “[We] were like, ‘Holy shit, are you fucking kidding me?’”<br />
<br />
Among those terms: Customer assets were loaned out on “an unsecured basis,” which meant that their money would not be safe in the event of a market collapse. The deposits were also not insured, nor were they guaranteed against errors or fraudulent activity.

“Whatever Gemini may or may not have done pales in comparison to what you see at Genesis, which was more than negligent when it came to protecting customer assets and complying with general best practices,” one former employee said. Among those problems, the person said, was not screening clients who were on, say, the Treasury’s blacklists — an allegation that was supported by a separate January suit filed by New York Department of Financial Services.

## First vessel uses alternate channel to bypass wreckage at Baltimore bridge collapse site

date: 2024-04-02, from: VOA News USA

Baltimore — A tugboat pushing a fuel barge was the first vessel to use an alternate channel to bypass the wreckage of Baltimore's collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge, which had blocked traffic along the vital port's main shipping channel.


The barge supplying jet fuel to the Department of Defense left late Monday and was destined for Delaware's Dover Air Force Base, though officials have said the temporary channel is open primarily to vessels that are helping with the cleanup effort. Some barges and tugs that have been stuck in the Port of Baltimore since the collapse are also scheduled to pass through the channel. 


Officials said they're working on a second channel on the southwest side of the main channel that will allow for deeper draft vessels, but they didn't say when that might open. 


Gov. Wes Moore is set Tuesday to visit one of two centers that the Small Business Administration opened in the area to help companies get loans to assist them with losses caused by the disruption of the bridge collapse. 




Crews are undertaking the complicated work of removing steel and concrete at the site of the bridge's deadly collapse after a container ship lost power and crashed into a supporting column. On Sunday, dive teams surveyed parts of the bridge and checked the ship, and workers in lifts used torches to cut above-water parts of the twisted steel superstructure. 


Authorities believe six workers plunged to their deaths in the collapse, including two whose bodies were recovered last week. Two other workers survived. 




Moore, a Democrat, said at a Monday afternoon news conference that his top priority is recovering the four remaining bodies, followed by reopening shipping channels. He said that he understands the urgency but that the risks are significant. Crews have described the mangled steel girders of the fallen bridge as "chaotic wreckage," he said. 


"What we're finding is it is more complicated than we hoped for initially," said U.S. Coast Guard Rear Admiral Shannon Gilreath. 


Meanwhile, the ship remains stationary, and its 21 crew members remain on board for now, officials said. 


President Joe Biden is expected to visit the collapse site Friday to meet with state and local officials and get at federal response efforts. 


The bridge fell as the cargo ship Dali lost power March 26 shortly after leaving Baltimore on its way to Sri Lanka. The ship issued a mayday alert, which allowed just enough time for police to stop traffic, but not enough to save a roadwork crew filling potholes on the bridge. 




The Dali is managed by Synergy Marine Group and owned by Grace Ocean Private Ltd., both of Singapore. Danish shipping giant Maersk chartered the Dali. 


Synergy and Grace Ocean filed a court petition Monday seeking to limit their legal liability, a routine but important procedure for cases litigated under U.S. maritime law. A federal court in Maryland will ultimately decide who is responsible and how much they owe. 


The filing seeks to cap the companies' liability at roughly $43.6 million. It estimates that the vessel itself is valued at up to $90 million and was owed over $1.1 million in income from freight. The estimate also deducts two major expenses: at least $28 million in repair costs and at least $19.5 million in salvage costs. 


Officials are trying to determine how to rebuild the major bridge, which was completed in 1977. It carried Interstate 695 around southeast Baltimore and became a symbol of the city's working-class roots and maritime culture. 


Congress is expected to consider aid packages to help people who lose jobs or businesses because of the prolonged closure of the Port of Baltimore. The port handles more cars and farm equipment than any other U.S. facility.

In 2021, a district court <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=68032932b8&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ruled in favor</a> of environmental group Friends of the Earth Netherlands and ordered Shell to cut its greenhouse gas emissions (including scope 3 emissions) by 45% by 2030. “This was the mother of all climate cases against corporations” because it opened the door to copycat cases, Klaas Hendrik Eller, an assistant professor at the University of Amsterdam’s center for transformative private law, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=d0393c9c2f&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> the <em>Financial Times</em>. Shell is appealing, insisting the order lacks legal basis and that companies cannot be held responsible for their clients’ emissions. Friends of the Earth will argue that the scientific evidence shows burning fossil fuels is causing global warming and that “Shell has a responsibility to act in accordance with climate science and international climate agreements.” A ruling is expected in the second half of this year.

<strong></strong>More than 30,200 fires were detected in Venezuela between January and March, the highest number ever recorded for that three-month period. The region is suffering from intense drought driven by human-caused climate change and the El Niño weather pattern. Researchers are worried these fires are a sign of things to come. “Everything is indicating we’re going to see other events of catastrophic fires – megafires that are huge in size and height,” Manoela Machado, a fire researcher at University of Oxford, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=78aa7acb1d&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">told <em>Reuters</em></a>. More than half of all the fires burning in the Amazon rainforest are located in Venezuela.
</p><h3>4. Human case of bird flu found in Texas</h3><p>
<strong></strong>A case of avian flu has been <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=345b1fc404&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">detected</a> in a human in Texas, marking the first such case since the virus was recently identified in cows across several states, and only the second case in U.S. history. The current outbreak of H5N1 has decimated bird populations across the world and also spread to mammals, including seals, mink, and now cows. Health experts worry the virus could mutate to become easily transmissible between humans, but so far there is no evidence of that happening. Still, “every single time is a little bit of Russian roulette,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=9adc576321&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> Ashish Jha, who led the Biden administration’s pandemic response. “You play that game long enough and one of these times it will become fit to spread among humans.” Researchers <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=0b87a7caee&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">say</a> climate change is altering birds’ breeding habits and migratory patterns in ways that leave them <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=023050554a&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more vulnerable</a> to bird flu.
</p><h3>5. In Europe, solar panels are the new garden fencing</h3><p>
<strong></strong>The price of solar panels has dropped so significantly that some households in Europe are using them as fencing in their yards, the <em>Financial Times</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=97c803ac21&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">reported</a>. Skyrocketing production out of China means solar panels are cheap and getting cheaper. But at the same time, installation costs for rooftop solar remain high, prompting some DIY-minded homeowners to roll up their sleeves and install panels as fencing. The panels don’t get quite as much sun as they would on a rooftop, but they still work. No word on what the neighbors have to say about it. Peculiar garden aesthetics aside, the solar glut has “brought Europe's solar makers to their knees,” <em>Politico</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=dfd1d66a3e&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> recently. Manufacturers want the European Commission to step in and help them. In the U.S., the cost of a solar panel is now half of what it was last year, and falling.

<p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> India is likely to experience more heat wave days than normal between April and June, potentially hitting agricultural production and hampering government efforts to bring down food inflation. There’s also a worry that soaring temperatures could deter people from voting in the upcoming elections. Also on the program: an agreement tackling the risk of AI, England&#8217;s expanded taxpayer-funded child care and the Dutch word for doing nothing</p>

## Fedora change proposal suggests switching the main Fedora Workstation release to KDE Plasma

date: 2024-04-02, from: OS News

Update: the proposal has now been formally announced on the devel mailing list and Fedora Discussions. I have been assured by the main author of the proposal itself that this is very much not an April Fools joke, but of course, there&#8217;s still the very real possibility we&#8217;re being led on here. Still, I&#8217;m taking the risk and treating this as a serious change proposal for Fedora, even though it&#8217;s likely to cause some controversy in the wider Fedora community. The proposal is written by Joshua Strobl, the lead developer of Budgie. Yes, this is a change proposal to make KDE the default desktop environment of Fedora Workstation. The reasoning is that KDE is more approachable for new users than GNOME, it supports standards better, the industry seems to be making moves to KDE (see the Steam Deck), and so on. KDE also has more advanced features people have come to expect from a desktop, like HDR, VRR, and more, and it&#8217;s the more advanced Wayland desktop. The important note here is that in the highly unlikely event this proposal would be accepted, it&#8217;s not like current Fedora GNOME users will be &#8216;upgraded&#8217; to KDE when Fedora 42 gets released. The idea is to promote the current Fedora Plasma spin to the main Fedora Workstation release, and demote the Fedora GNOME release to a mere Fedora spin, like KDE is now. While I would personally support this change, it&#8217;s pretty much 100% unlikely this change proposal will make it through. Red Hat and Fedora are entirely GNOME-first, and no matter how much I believe that&#8217;s misguided when looking at the state of the two primary open source desktops today, that&#8217;s not going to change. Still, it&#8217;s an interesting discussion point, if only to highlight that the frustrations with GNOME run a lot deeper than people seem to think.

## 2024-03-27 Sick? Or Hayfever?

date: 2024-04-02, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-03-27-sick-or-hayfever">2024-03-27 Sick? Or Hayfever?</h1>

<p>Back from the trip to Locarno and I’m feeling sick. The nose, the frontal sinus cavity, ouch.</p>

<p>But strangely enough, the birch pollen season has also started. So what is it?</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-03-26-sick-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>(Zürich is super dark red.)</p>

<p>The report says:</p>

<p>“Eschen und Birken blühen frühzeitig in der gesamten Schweiz, und für deren Pollen werden in den kommenden Tagen im Flachland und in mittleren Lagen mässige bis starke Belastungswerte erwartet.”</p>

<p>Ash and birch are in bloom earlier than usual.</p>

<p>I’ll take one of these Cetirizine-based hayfever pills, drink another cup of herbal infusion and go back to bed.
Hopefully at least one of these things will help.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Hayfever">#Hayfever</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-03-28</strong>. Ugh. Staying in bed.</p>

<p><strong>2024-03-29</strong>. Definitely sick. 🤒</p>

<p><strong>2024-03-30</strong>. Still sick, but the fever is gone. Perhaps now it’s just the hayfever?</p>

<p><strong>2024-03-31</strong>. Left the house for <a href="2024-03-31-flowers">a walk</a> with Claudia and a friend that lives nearby.</p>

<p><strong>2024-04-01</strong>. Actually spent some time at the laptop. I guess turnaround cautiously confirmed?</p>

<p><strong>2024-04-02</strong>. Recovery is on track. Falling asleep was hard. Some nose blowing still. Not sure about focus. It’s good enough for an hour or so? Back to bed now. I hope to be back on my feet tomorrow!</p>

## Person is diagnosed with bird flu after being in contact with cows in Texas

date: 2024-04-02, from: VOA News USA

ATLANTA — A person in Texas has been diagnosed with bird flu, an infection tied to the recent discovery of the virus in dairy cows, health officials said Monday.


The patient was being treated with an antiviral drug and their only reported symptom was eye redness, Texas health officials said. Health officials say the person had been in contact with cows presumed to be infected, and the risk to the public remains low. 


It marks the first known instance globally of a person catching this version of bird flu from a mammal, federal health officials said.


However, there’s no evidence of person-to-person spread or that anyone has become infected from milk or meat from livestock, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.


Genetic tests don’t suggest that the virus suddenly is spreading more easily or that it is causing more severe illness, Shah said. And current antiviral medications still seem to work, he added.


Last week, dairy cows in Texas and Kansas were reported to be infected with bird flu — and federal agriculture officials later confirmed infections in a Michigan dairy herd that had recently received cows from Texas. None of the hundreds of affected cows have died, Shah said.


Since 2020, a bird flu virus has been spreading among more animal species – including dogs, cats, skunks, bears and even seals and porpoises – in scores of countries. 


However, the detection in U.S. livestock is an “unexpected and problematic twist,” said Dr. Ali Khan, a former CDC outbreak investigator who is now dean of the University of Nebraska’s public health college.


This bird flu was first identified as a threat to people during a 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong. More than 460 people have died in the past two decades from bird flu infections, according to the World Health Organization. 


Most infected people got it directly from birds, but scientists have been on guard for any sign of spread among people. 


Texas officials didn’t identify the newly infected person, nor release any details about what brought them in contact with the cows.


The CDC does not recommend testing for people who have no symptoms. Roughly a dozen people in Texas who did have symptoms were tested in connection with the dairy cow infections, but only the one person came back positive, Shah said.


It's only the second time a person in the United States has been diagnosed with what’s known as Type A H5N1 virus. In 2022, a prison inmate in a work program picked it up while killing infected birds at a poultry farm in Montrose County, Colorado. His only symptom was fatigue, and he recovered.

## April 1, 2024 

date: 2024-04-02, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

On Tuesday, March 26, Judge Juan Merchan, who is presiding over Trump&#8217;s election interference case, put Trump under a gag order to stop his attacks on court staff, prosecutors, jurors, and witnesses. On Wednesday, Trump renewed his attacks on the judge and the judge&#8217;s daughter. On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton took the unusual step of talking publicly about what threats of violence meant to the rule of law. Walton, who was appointed to the federal bench by President George W. Bush, told Kaitlan Collins of CNN that threats, especially threats to a judge&#8217;s family, undermine the ability of judges to carry out their duties.

## Overwhelming majority of Ukraine supplemental funding spent inside US

date: 2024-04-02, from: VOA News USA

The U.S. Congress left Washington for a break without deciding on a supplemental funding bill to arm Ukraine and other allies. Republicans who oppose the funding say Congress should spend its money on domestic concerns, but as VOA Pentagon correspondent Carla Babb reports, the funding bill hits closer to home than many Americans may realize.

## US, Britain announce partnership on AI safety, testing

date: 2024-04-02, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The United States and Britain on Monday announced a new partnership on the science of artificial intelligence safety, amid growing concerns about upcoming next-generation versions.


Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and British Technology Secretary Michelle Donelan signed a memorandum of understanding in Washington to jointly develop advanced AI model testing, following commitments announced at an AI Safety Summit in Bletchley Park in November.


"We all know AI is the defining technology of our generation," Raimondo said. "This partnership will accelerate both of our institutes work across the full spectrum to address the risks of our national security concerns and the concerns of our broader society."


Britain and the United States are among countries establishing government-led AI safety institutes.


Britain said in October its institute would examine and test new types of AI, while the United States said in November it was launching its own safety institute to evaluate risks from so-called frontier AI models and is now working with 200 companies and entites.


Under the formal partnership, Britain and the United States plan to perform at least one joint testing exercise on a publicly accessible model and are considering exploring personnel exchanges between the institutes. Both are working to develop similar partnerships with other countries to promote AI safety.


"This is the first agreement of its kind anywhere in the world," Donelan said. "AI is already an extraordinary force for good in our society and has vast potential to tackle some of the world's biggest challenges, but only if we are able to grip those risks."


Generative AI, which can create text, photos and videos in response to open-ended prompts, has spurred excitement as well as fears it could make some jobs obsolete, upend elections and potentially overpower humans and catastrophic effects.


In a joint interview with Reuters Monday, Raimondo and Donelan urgent joint action was needed to address AI risks.


"Time is of the essence because the next set of models are about to be released, which will be much, much more capable," Donelan said. "We have a focus one the areas that we are dividing and conquering and really specializing."


Raimondo said she would raise AI issues at a meeting of the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council in Belgium Thursday.


The Biden administration plans to soon announce additions to its AI team, Raimondo said. "We are pulling in the full resources of the U.S. government."


Both countries plan to share key information on capabilities and risks associated with AI models and systems and technical research on AI safety and security.


In October, Biden signed an executive order that aims to reduce the risks of AI. In January, the Commerce Department said it was proposing to require U.S. cloud companies to determine whether foreign entities are accessing U.S. data centers to train AI models.


Britain said in February it would spend more than 100 million pounds ($125.5 million) to launch nine new research hubs and AI train regulators about the technology.


Raimondo said she was especially concerned about the threat of AI applied to bioterrorism or a nuclear war simulation.


"Those are the things where the consequences could be catastrophic and so we really have to have zero tolerance for some of these models being used for that capability," she said.

## Judge expands gag order after Trump's social media posts about judge's daughter

date: 2024-04-02, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — The judge in Donald Trump's hush-money criminal case expanded the former president's gag order Monday after the former president assailed the judge's daughter and made a false claim about her on social media last week.


Judge Juan M. Merchan said his original gag order issued last Tuesday did not include members of his family, but Trump's subsequent actions warranted including them.


Merchan's daughter, Loren Merchan, is a Democratic political consultant. Prosecutors had urged Merchan to clarify or expand his gag order after Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform that Loren Merchan "makes money by working to 'Get Trump,'" and wrongly accused her of posting a social media photo showing him behind bars.


The trial, which involves allegations Trump falsified payment records in a scheme to cover up negative stories during his 2016 presidential campaign, is scheduled to begin April 15. Trump denies wrongdoing and has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records.


Trump's lawyers had fought the gag order and its expansion, arguing that Trump was engaging in protected political campaign speech.
