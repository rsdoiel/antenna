There’s no doubt that the issue of safely charging e-bikes is a growing
topic of concern in the US. And while the media frenzy around relatively
rare e-bike fires
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/01/15/no-e-bike-fires-are-not-a-leading-cause-of-death-in-nyc/">is
often overblown</a>, it doesn’t rule out a real risk associated with
lithium-ion batteries. Now, a new charging solution designed in the US
could provide an answer to the problem.

Vice President to Meet Guatemalan Leader on Immigration, Anti-Corruption
Drive</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Vice President Kamala Harris plans to meet on Monday
with President Bernardo Arévalo of Guatemala as the U.S. grapples with
an influx of migrants to its southern border, thousands from that
Central American nation. </p>
<p>The two leaders are expected to discuss the Biden administration’s
use of so-called “safe mobility offices,” which were set up in
Guatemala, Colombia, Costa Rica and Ecuador in the fall, among other
immigration matters. The safe mobility offices are designed to
streamline the U.S. refugee process so migrants apply where they are and
avoid paying smugglers to make the journey north. </p>
<p>As the 2024 election heats up, immigration has become a rising
bipartisan concern. Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress say the
system is broken, but efforts by lawmakers to address the problems have
failed. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden has tasked Harris with working to
address the reasons people choose to leave their homelands to migrate to
the U.S. </p>
<p>Harris and Arévalo will also discuss Arévalo’s anti-corruption agenda
and how the U.S. can support the effort, according to a White House
official, previewing the talks on the condition of anonymity. </p>
<p>Arévalo won the presidency in August, beating the establishment
candidate by a comfortable margin. He is the son of a former president
credited with implementing some of Guatemala’s key labor protections,
but his strong showing in a crowded field was still a shock. </p>
<p>The politician with a background in academia and conflict resolution
caught fire with a message of challenging the country’s entrenched power
structure and resuming the fight against corruption. </p>
<p>The Democratic vice president is also expected to announce $5.2
billion in investments in Central America. </p>
<p>While still among the lowest monthly tallies in Biden’s presidency,
the number of arrests for illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border
nudged upward in February over the previous month to 189,922. Of those,
23,780 were Guatemalan.</p>

<a href="https://electrek.co/guides/china/">Chinese</a> EV automaker IM
Motors is on the cusp of launching its fourth EV model and is touting
some impressive specs to get the hype train going. The company’s co-CEO
recently shared that the new L6 EV will be powered by a 900V platform
equipped with solid-state batteries that can deliver over 1,000 km of

which btw I have not read. This was emphatically not Game of Thrones,
though some of the actors played roles in both series, and in each case
that was awkward. Not the best actors, they didn’t get much screentime
in GoT, but here, they get the big lines and omg it was embarrassing,
they don’t pull it off. Creepy. I loved the first four episodes,
incredible story, and the special effects, awesome. Then it really
started to stink in episodes in 6 and 7, endless stupid dialog with
music that made every stupid thing like a climax of a sort. But I was
still watching, and then it came back roaring in the final episode. On
the other hand it’s like so much of today’s TV, superheros, epic
conflicts, resolution, good guys win. A cross between

that 33 projects have been selected to receive a slice of $6 billion in
government funding to speed up the decarbonization of America’s
industrial sector. The projects cover some of the most energy-intensive
industries, like cement, chemicals, steel, and food production. The
Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) expects the projects to cut
the equivalent of more than 14 million metric tons of carbon dioxide
(CO2) emissions each year, which is equivalent to the annual emissions
of 3 million gasoline-powered cars. The initiatives are also expected to
help create a lot of new jobs, and about 80% of the projects are located
in disadvantaged communities. Some project examples here:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Century Aluminum Company could get up to $500 million to build a new
“green” aluminum smelter that cuts emissions by 75% compared to a
traditional smelter due to its energy-efficient design and use of
carbon-free energy.
</li>
<li>
Brimstone Energy could get up to $189 million to build its first
commercial-scale demo plant to produce carbon-free industry standard
cement.
</li>
<li>
ExxonMobil could get up to $331.9 million for its Baytown Olefins Plant
Carbon Reduction Project, which would use hydrogen instead of natural
gas to produce ethylene, an important chemical used in tons of things
like packaging and vehicles.

organized by the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center, Eli
Technologies, the Building Decarbonization Coalition, Rewiring America,
and RMI, but they’re looking for additional collaborators and
stakeholders as they build up the data set for eventual launch.
“Government-funded rebates, tax credits, and other purchasing incentives
can be a key driver of consumer adoption of pollution-free technologies
like heat pumps, yet navigating fragmented and outdated data can be a
confusing and frustrating process,” Andre Meurer, head of product at the
Building Decarbonization Coalition, said in a press release. The NODE
Collective is expected to cover more than 2,000 incentives on offer,
from heat pumps and induction stovetops to home battery storage and
electric panel upgrades, and the list will be maintained so nothing is

filed this month, the experts requested NOAA update its rule in three
ways: First, they want anyone applying to use solar geoengineering
(which involves spraying aerosols into the sky to bring down
temperatures) to report details of their project that can help gauge
potential risks and impacts. Second, the petitioners want to see more
reporting requirements for international geoengineering projects that

because they are “super climate pollutants” with far greater warming
potential than carbon dioxide. The U.S. still allows imports of HFCs but
only when companies apply for “allowances” – and those allowances are
getting smaller each year, with the goal of reducing the country’s HFC
consumption and production by 85% by 2036. As the phase-down continues,
the EPA wants to discourage the development of an HFC black market by
showing zero tolerance on illegal imports. Recently a California man was
charged with bringing HFCs in from Mexico.

id="eu-opens-non-compliance-investigations-against-alphabet-apple-and-meta-under-the-digital-markets-act">EU
opens non-compliance investigations against Alphabet, Apple and Meta
under the Digital Markets Act</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>It turns out Apple, Facebook, and Google were not as clever with
their malicious compliance with the European Union’s DMA as they thought
they were, as the European Commission has opened investigations into
their compliance plans. Especially Apple, who has been most public about
its malicious compliance, seems to be the target. Today, the Commission
has opened non-compliance investigations under the Digital Markets Act
(DMA) into Alphabet’s rules on steering in Google Play and
self-preferencing on Google Search, Apple’s rules on steering in the App
Store and the choice screen for Safari and Meta’s “pay or consent
model”. The Commission suspects that the measures put in place by these
gatekeepers fall short of effective compliance of their obligations
under the DMA. In addition, the Commission has launched investigatory
steps relating to Apple’s new fee structure for alternative app stores
and Amazon’s ranking practices on its marketplace. Finally, the
Commission has ordered gatekeepers to retain certain documents to
monitor the effective implementation and compliance with their
obligations. ↫ European Commission press release This is entirely
unsurprising. Google’s and Facebook’s compliance plans were less
scrutinised in the press, but all still raised questions about whether
they would pass mustard. Apple’s plans, meanwhile, were universally seen
as deeply malicious and not compliant, and it seems the European
Commission agrees. Apple’s continuous wild, flailing attacks on the EU
and the DMA certainly aren’t helping, either. There’s no denying Apple’s
behaviour has been deeply unprofessional and anti-European Union, which
contrasts strongly with how Apple and Tim Cook operate in China, where
they face much stricter rules than they do in the EU. Tim Cook is
currently in China praising and buttering up to the Chinese totalitarian
regime, while the company has been attacking the European Union and DMA
almost non-stop for months now. It really shows where Apple’s priorities
lie. Meanwhile, Facebook’s pay-for-privacy model was always going to be
a hard sell at €10 a month, and as such, the company already announced
it was going to cut that cost in half. Google’s plans are a bit more
nebulous, since it’s a bit more difficult to see tangible results from
things like search rankings, but it seems here, too, the European
Commission has its worries about compliance. The European Commission
intends to complete its investigations within a year, and if found in
violation of the law, companies can be fined for up to 10% of their
worldwide turnover, which can grow up to 20% for repeated
infringements.</p>

Firefox fork makes its modifications closed source due to forks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>Recently, a few people suggested I give the browser Floorp a try, a
Firefox fork with some additional UI changes and additions. Since it was
based on Firefox ESR, however, I saw no point in even trying it, because
I prefer to be on the latest Firefox release. It seems I accidentally
made the right choice, since yesterday the developers behind Floorp
decided to take their modifications closed source. The appearance of
Floorp forks – which, may I remind you, is a fork itself – seems to be
the cause. I know it’s not nice of me to say, but Floorp has been in too
much demand. It am surprise to me that companies and organizations would
fork a fork that I had created when I was still a teenager, and at first
I was happy about it, but it was not beneficial to me, and on the
contrary, it was mentally draining. There were forks that wanted to hide
the fact that they were Floorp forks, forks that did not want to
contribute to Floorp at all, forks that used the code for life and just
changed the name of Floorp, and many other forks were born. ↫ Floorp
blog It seems the developer of Floorp is rather young, and started the
project as a teenager, and as such, I don’t think we should be too harsh
on them – I did some dumb things as a teenager – but complaining about
forks of your own fork seems a bit disingenuous, regardless of how young
and inexperienced you are. I understand seeing your work forked into
competing browsers can be frustrating, but it’s a core part of the open
source world, especially if you yourself owe your product to forking,
too.</p>

<p>date: 2024-03-25, updated: 2024-03-21, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
The debate over professionalizing software engineers is decades old.
(The basic idea is that, like lawyers and architects, there should be
some professional licensing requirement for software engineers.) Here’s
a
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4759742">law
journal article</a> recommending the same idea for AI engineers.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This Article proposes another way: professionalizing AI engineering.
Require AI engineers to obtain licenses to build commercial AI products,
push them to collaborate on scientifically-supported, domain-specific
technical standards, and charge them with policing themselves. This
Article’s proposal addresses AI harms at their inception, influencing
the very engineering decisions that give rise to them in the first
place. By wresting control over information and system design away from
companies and handing it to AI engineers, professionalization engenders
trustworthy AI by design. Beyond recommending the specific policy
solution of professionalization, this Article seeks to shift the
discourse on AI away from an emphasis on light-touch, ex post solutions
that address already-created products to a greater focus on ex ante
controls that precede AI development. We’ve used this playbook before in
fields requiring a high level of expertise where a duty to the public
welfare must trump business motivations. What if, like doctors, AI
engineers also vowed to do no harm?…

From the BBC World Service: In an exclusive interview with the BBC, the
World Trade Organization’s director-general Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala says
that when countries bring production back home — known as “reshoring” —
it does not necessarily make supply chains more resilient. She thinks it
contributes to a fragmentation of global trading relationships. Plus,
how the popularity of the Mediterranean island Ibiza has driven up
rents, making life hard for workers and the tourist businesses that
employ them. And the streets of Paris see the return of a historic race

There’s a lot of metal sitting at the bottom of the ocean. A
<a href="https://seabedspotlight.substack.com/p/is-there-really-that-much-metal-at" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">single
swath</a> of seabed in the eastern Pacific holds enough nickel, cobalt
and manganese to electrify America’s passenger vehicle fleet
<a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/70231662" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">several
times</a> over. But whether to mine this trove for the energy transition
is an open question — one that’s sparked many an
<a href="https://twitter.com/wang_seaver/status/1757830676194472128" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">internecine
feud</a> among environmentalists.
</p>
<p>
Most of the seabed in question falls beyond the jurisdiction of any one
country. This area, the High Seas, covers a whopping 43% of Earth’s
surface. And one group decides whether (and how) to mine it: the
<a href="https://www.isa.org.jm/the-mining-code/draft-exploitation-regulations/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">International
Seabed Authority</a>. Created by the United Nations, the ISA counts 168
nations among its members.
</p>
<p>
This month, ISA policymakers are meeting in Jamaica to hash out the
rules of the road for a future seabed mining industry. They’ll debate
everything from environmental protection to financial regulation of
mining companies.
</p>
<p>
ISA members include every major economy with an ocean coastline — except
the United States.
</p>
<p>
The U.S. has yet to ratify the global treaty that chartered the ISA back
in 1982. That leaves America sidelined as ISA member countries decide on
such matters as the fate of the global ocean and the pace of the energy
transition. You know, small stuff.
</p>
<p>
Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, has been leading a
lonely, decade-long quest to convince Senate Republicans to abandon
their long-held skepticism of the ISA. “Our hands are tied behind our
backs,” Murkowski told me. She argues the U.S. has lost the reins on
some of the biggest questions surrounding
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/cmm/what-are-critical-materials-and-critical-minerals" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">critical
minerals</a> sourcing. “When it comes to the ISA, it’s China that is
determining the rules. That’s not a good place for us to be.”
</p>
<p>
A new, bipartisan
<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-resolution/466/text?s=1&r=28" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">resolution</a>
in the Senate could finally give the U.S. a full seat at the global
table in seabed mining negotiations. The legislation faces an uphill
climb but, if passed, could allow the Biden administration to take
victory laps on two of its ostensible priorities:

<h3>
American exceptionalism at sea
</h3>
<p>
Marine experts affectionately dub the United Nations Convention on the
Law of the Sea the
<a href="https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/koh_english.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">constitution
for the oceans</a>. The treaty sets ground rules for all manner of
seafaring activity on the High Seas, including transit, fishing, and
cable laying. And despite that there was no deep seabed mining happening
at the time (there still isn’t, yet), UNCLOS was clear about who owns
all that metal under the sea.
</p>
<p>
“It’s everyone’s property,” Andrew Thaler, a deep-sea ecologist and CEO
of the marine consultancy Blackbeard Biologic, told me. “It codifies the
idea that this is a shared resource among all of humanity,” said Thaler.
“And it has to be managed as such.”
</p>
<p>
Lofty ideals, with practical implications. Under UNCLOS, a country
cannot unilaterally decide to plunder seabed resources for its sole
benefit. To mine the ocean floor, nations and private companies must
receive various permissions from the ISA, where decisions are often made
by consensus or supermajority vote among member countries. Mining
operations must also pay royalties to every ISA member for the privilege
of accessing (and degrading) humankind’s shared resource.
</p>
<p>
In Thaler’s assessment, it’s all very egalitarian. “UNCLOS is an
incredibly progressive piece of international diplomacy,” he said.
</p>
<p>
Which helps explain why the U.S. never ratified it.
</p>

Ronald Reagan occupied the Oval Office in 1982 when the vast majority of
nations voted to adopt UNCLOS. He wasn’t keen on the treaty’s “common
heritage” principle and didn’t want to have to deal with the rest of the
world. As the New York Times
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/10/world/us-will-not-sign-sea-law-treaty.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>,
“the United States, possessing some of the most advanced technology and
the most resources to be developed, was unhappy at the prospect of
having to share seabed mining decision-making with smaller, often
third-world countries.”
</p>
<p>
The irony here is that Reagan essentially <em>ceded</em> decision-making
to those “often third-world countries” by keeping the U.S. out of the
treaty. To this day, the U.S. is relegated to
<a href="https://www.isa.org.jm/observers/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">observer
status</a> at ISA negotiations, the same standing enjoyed by
non-governmental organizations like Greenpeace and the International
Cable Protection Committee.
</p>
<p>
The U.S. sends State Department officials to the ISA to follow along the
debate and occasionally make statements. But America’s delegation cannot
vote on important matters and, crucially, cannot sit on the ISA Council,
a subset of ISA members currently drafting comprehensive regulations to
govern the financial and environmental aspects of a prospective seabed
mining industry. (That all-important rulebook is known as the
<a href="https://www.isa.org.jm/the-mining-code/draft-exploitation-regulations/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mining
Code</a>.)
</p>
<p>
UNCLOS members updated the treaty in 1994 to “guarantee the U.S. a seat
on the ISA Council if it ratifies,” among other things, Pradeep Singh,
an ocean governance expert at the Research Institute for Sustainability,
told me. The U.S. itself played a “pivotal role” in negotiating such
favorable terms, said Singh, “but ultimately they still did not ratify.”
</p>
<p>
Following Reagan’s lead, Republicans have typically remained skeptical
of UNCLOS, while Democrats — including the Biden administration—have
supported it.
</p>
<p>
“We ought to join the Law of the Sea,” Jose Fernandez, President Biden’s
Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the
Environment, told me. “We are the only major economy that’s not a
member. It hurts our interests.”
</p>
<p>
Fernandez noted that the Biden administration has neither endorsed nor
condemned seabed mining as a source of minerals for the energy
transition (“Let’s just say we’re taking a precautionary approach”), but
that ratifying UNCLOS would allow the U.S. to better advocate for strong
environmental protections and other provisions in the ISA’s mining code.
</p>
<p>
Inevitably, seabed mining will impact deep-sea ecosystems that
scientists are just beginning to map and explore. Research indicates
that mining could also interfere with seabed carbon storage and fish
migration — and that land-based mineral reserves
<a href="https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(23)00001-6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">are
sufficient</a> to meet the needs of the energy transition.
</p>
<p>
Supporters of seabed mining counter that relying on terrestrial minerals
alone could perpetuate the environmental and social harms long
associated with mining on land, including deforestation, tainted water
supplies, forced relocation of mine-adjacent communities, and child
labor. They also say it could
<a href="https://seabedspotlight.substack.com/p/this-oceanographer-wants-you-to-consider" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reduce
the cost</a> of acquiring minerals and thus speed the deployment of
low-carbon energy systems, although the overall cost of extracting metal
has not yet been demonstrated as, again, no one is currently doing it.
</p>
<h3>
A marine technology arms race
</h3>
<p>
Ratifying UNCLOS would require a two- thirds majority vote in the Senate
— a towering hurdle in the polarized chamber. But new momentum is
building, thanks to a rare unifying force lurking across the Pacific
Ocean.
</p>
<p>
China holds five separate ISA licenses to explore for seabed minerals.
That’s more than any other country. (The U.S. cannot obtain such
licenses because it is not an ISA member.) Beijing is also
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2023/china-deep-sea-mining-military-renewable-energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pouring
R&amp;D money</a> into deep-sea technology.
</p>
<p>
This is all of concern to U.S. lawmakers looking to friendshore
America’s mineral supply chains, which China already dominates. House
Republicans introduced
<a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/eenews/f/eenews/?id=0000018e-3449-d2cd-a9bf-b5cd04150002" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
bill</a> earlier this month to develop a U.S.-based seabed mining
industry. The brief seven-page document mentions China on four separate
occasions.
</p>
<p>
Among the concerned lawmakers in the Senate is Murkowski. She’s long
pushed for UNCLOS ratification over the isolationist objections of her
fellow Republicans. But Murkowski sees opposition dissolving amid
worries over China’s maritime activity.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve been working on this issue for a decade plus, and I’ve never been
in a Congress where there are more that are engaged on this issue from
both sides of the aisle,” said Murkowski.
</p>
<p>
Mining firms aiming to process their seabed haul on U.S. soil are
<a href="https://twitter.com/gtbgtb/status/1717839805743083625" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hyping</a>
the China concern, too.
</p>
<p>
Also earlier this month, a group of more than 300 former U.S. political
and military leaders
<a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/f/?id=0000018e-3661-de4d-a19e-b76173430000&source=email" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sent
a letter</a> to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations urging UNCLOS
ratification. Signatories included former Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton and three former U.S. Secretaries of Defense.
</p>
<p>
Murkowski hopes to line up enough support for UNCLOS ratification in the
Senate to bring the issue to a vote next year, and the resolution
currently sits with the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. “I feel
very confident about the momentum we have right now,” Murkowski said.
</p>
<h3>
A simmering debate
</h3>
<p>
As UNCLOS gains political traction in the U.S., calls for a cautionary
approach to seabed mining have grown louder the world over.
</p>
<p>
More than 800 marine experts have
<a href="https://seabedminingsciencestatement.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">urged
a pause</a> on the controversial industry, citing uncertain
environmental impacts and risks to ocean biodiversity. At least 25
national governments have echoed those calls at the ISA. Some
manufacturers—including BMW, Volvo, Volkswagen, Rivian, Renault, Google
and Samsung—have
<a href="https://www.stopdeepseabedmining.org/statement/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pledged</a>
to forgo ocean-mined minerals in their products.
</p>
<p>
A shift in electric vehicle technology adds another wrinkle to the
debate. A
<a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2023/trends-in-batteries" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">growing
share</a> of EV batteries sold globally don’t include any nickel or
cobalt — two metals found in abundance on the ocean floor — which
complicates the business case for seabed mining.
</p>
<p>
Compared to traditional nickel-manganese-cobalt batteries, these
increasingly popular lithium-iron-phosphate batteries are cheaper but
provide lower energy density (i.e. range). Consumers in China, the
<a href="https://hbr.org/2024/01/3-drivers-of-chinas-booming-electric-vehicle-market" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">world’s
largest</a> EV market, seem
<a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Electric-cars-in-China/BYD-challenges-CATL-s-EV-battery-crown-in-China" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">willing
to accept</a> that tradeoff. But even with a slipping market share,
nickel-manganese-cobalt batteries and their constituent elements could
see absolute demand grow as the global EV industry booms.
</p>
<p>
In the name of the energy transition, some countries such as Norway and
the Cook Islands have gone ahead and greenlit mineral exploration in the
Exclusive Economic Zones off their own coastlines,.
</p>
<p>
The debate reached a fever pitch over the summer when The Metals
Company, a Canadian firm,
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/04/the-metals-company-puts-out-controversial-timeline-for-deep-sea-mining.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced
plans</a> to apply for the world’s first ever commercial mining license
on the High Seas; it’s partnering with the government of Nauru on the
application.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the ISA is unlikely to adopt a final mining code before The
Metals Company submits its application, which is expected as soon as
August — a timing mismatch that could throw the seabed mining debate
into chaos. (The ISA Council has signaled it would not support the
approval of a mining application until regulations are finalized.)
</p>
<p>
All the while, the U.S. will be watching. And unless the Senate ratifies
UNCLOS, it won’t be doing much else.

<h2 id="tiktok-bill-faces-uncertain-fate-in-senate">TikTok Bill Faces
Uncertain Fate in Senate</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The young voices in the messages left for North Carolina
Senator Thom Tillis were laughing, but the words were ominous.</p>
<p>“OK, listen, if you ban TikTok I will find you and shoot you,” one
said, giggling and talking over other young voices in the background.
“I’ll shoot you and find you and cut you into pieces.” Another
threatened to kill Tillis, and then take their own life.</p>
<p>Tillis’s office says it has received around 1,000 calls about TikTok
since the House passed legislation this month that would ban the popular
app if its China-based owner doesn’t sell its stake. TikTok has been
urging its users — many of whom are young — to call their
representatives, even providing an easy link to the phone numbers. “The
government will take away the community that you and millions of other
Americans love,” read one pop-up message from the company when users
opened the app.</p>
<p>Tillis, who supports the House bill, reported the call to the police.
“What I hated about that was it demonstrates the enormous influence
social media platforms have on young people,” he said in an
interview.</p>
<p>While more aggressive than most, TikTok’s extensive lobbying campaign
is the latest attempt by the tech industry to head off any new
legislation — and it’s a fight the industry usually wins. For years
Congress has failed to act on bills that would protect users’ privacy,
protect children from online threats, make companies more liable for
their content and put loose guardrails around artificial intelligence,
among other things.</p>
<p>“I mean, it’s almost embarrassing,” says Senate Intelligence
Committee Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., a former tech executive who is
also supporting the TikTok bill and has long tried to push his
colleagues to regulate the industry. “I would hate for us to maintain
our perfect zero batting average on tech legislation.”</p>
<p>Some see the TikTok bill as the best chance for now to regulate the
tech industry and set a precedent, if a narrow one focused on just one
company. President Joe Biden has said he would sign the House bill,
which overwhelmingly passed 362-65 this month after a rare 50-0
committee vote moving it to the floor.</p>
<p>But it’s already running into roadblocks in the Senate, where there
is little unanimity on the best approach to ensure that China doesn’t
access private data from the app’s 170 million U.S. users or influence
them through its algorithms.</p>
<p>Other factors are holding the Senate back. The tech industry is broad
and falls under the jurisdiction of several different committees. Plus,
the issues at play don’t fall cleanly on partisan lines, making it
harder for lawmakers to agree on priorities and how legislation should
be written. Senate Commerce Committee Chairwoman Maria Cantwell,
D-Wash., has so far been reluctant to embrace the TikTok bill, for
example, calling for hearings first and suggesting that the Senate may
want to rewrite it.</p>
<p>“We’re going through a process,” Cantwell said. “It’s important to
get it right.”</p>
<p>Warner, on the other hand, says the House bill is the best chance to
get something done after years of inaction. And he says that the
threatening calls from young people are a good example of why the
legislation is needed: “It makes the point, do we really want that kind
of messaging being able to be manipulated by the Communist Party of
China?”</p>
<p>Some lawmakers are worried that blocking TikTok could anger millions
of young people who use the app, a crucial segment of voters in
November’s election. But Warner says “the debate has shifted” from talk
of an outright ban a year ago to the House bill which would force
TikTok, a wholly owned subsidiary of Chinese technology firm ByteDance
Ltd., to sell its stake for the app to continue operating.</p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris, in a television interview that aired
Sunday, acknowledged the popularity of the app and that it has become an
income stream for many people. She said the administration does not
intend to ban TikTok but instead deal with its ownership. “We understand
its purpose and its utility and the enjoyment that it gives a lot of
folks,” Harris told ABC’s ”This Week.”</p>
<p>Republicans are divided. While most of them support the TikTok
legislation, others are wary of overregulation and the government
targeting one specific entity.</p>
<p>“The passage of the House TikTok ban is not just a misguided
overreach; it’s a draconian measure that stifles free expression,
tramples constitutional rights, and disrupts the economic pursuits of
millions of Americans,” Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul posted on X, formerly
Twitter.</p>
<p>Hoping to persuade their colleagues to support the bill, Democratic
Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Republican Sen. Marsha
Blackburn of Tennessee have called for intelligence agencies to
declassify information about TikTok and China’s ownership that has been
provided to senators in classified briefings.</p>
<p>“It is critically important that the American people, especially
TikTok users, understand the national security issues at stake,” the
senators said in a joint statement.</p>
<p>Blumenthal and Blackburn have separate legislation they have been
working on for several years aimed at protecting children’s online
safety, but the Senate has yet to vote on it. Efforts to regulate online
privacy have also stalled, as has legislation to make technology
companies more liable for the content they publish.</p>
<p>And an effort by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to
quickly move legislation that would regulate the burgeoning artificial
intelligence industry has yet to show any results.</p>
<p>Schumer has said very little about the TikTok bill or whether he
might put it on the Senate floor.</p>
<p>“The Senate will review the legislation when it comes over from the
House,” was all he would say after the House passed the bill.</p>
<p>South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds, a Republican who has worked with
Schumer on the artificial intelligence effort, says he thinks the Senate
can eventually pass a TikTok bill, even if it’s a different version. He
says the classified briefings “convinced the vast majority of members”
that they have to address the collection of data from the app and
TikTok’s ability to push out misinformation to users.</p>
<p>“I think it’s a clear danger to our country if we don’t act,” he
said. “It does not have to be done in two weeks, but it does have to be
done.”</p>
<p>Rounds says he and Schumer are still holding regular meetings on
artificial intelligence, as well, and will soon release some of their
ideas publicly. He says he’s optimistic that the Senate will eventually
act to regulate the tech industry.</p>
<p>“There will be some areas that we will not try to get into, but there
are some areas that we have very broad consensus on,” Rounds says.</p>
<p>Tillis says senators may have to continue laying the groundwork for a
while and educating colleagues on why some regulation is needed, with an
eye toward passing legislation in the next Congress.</p>
<p>“It can’t be the wild, wild west,” Tillis said.</p>

Kevin Hart Honored With Mark Twain Prize for American Humor</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Kevin Hart, who rose from the open mics and comedy clubs
of his native Philadelphia to become one of the country’s most
recognizable performers, will receive the Mark Twain Prize for American
Humor at a gala performance Sunday at the Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts.</p>
<p>Hart, 44, has honed a signature style that combines his diminutive
height, expressive face and motor-mouth delivery into a successful
stand-up act.</p>
<p>In Hollywood, Hart made his movie debut in the 2002 film “Paper
Soldiers” and came to mainstream fame through a string of scene-stealing
cameos in hits such as 2005’s “The 40-Year-Old-Virgin.”</p>
<p>Hart’s films have grossed more than $4.23 billion globally.</p>
<p>Now in its 25th year, the Mark Twain Prize annually honors performers
who have made a lasting impact on humor and culture. Honorees receive a
bronze bust of Twain, the iconic American writer and satirist whose real
name was Samuel Clemens.</p>
<p>Mark Twain recipients are honored with a night of testimonials and
video tributes, often featuring previous award winners. Other comedians
receiving the lifetime achievement award include George Carlin, Whoopi
Goldberg, Bob Newhart, Carol Burnett and Dave Chapelle. Bill Cosby, the
2009 recipient, had his Mark Twain Prize rescinded in 2019 amid
allegations of sexual assault.</p>

Storm From Solar Flare Could Disrupt Radio Communications</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BOULDER, Colo. — Space weather forecasters have issued a geomagnetic
storm watch through Monday, saying an outburst of plasma from a solar
flare could interfere with radio transmissions on Earth. It could also
make for great aurora viewing.</p>
<p>There’s no reason for the public to be concerned, according to the
alert issued Saturday by NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center in
Boulder, Colorado.</p>
<p>The storm could interrupt high-frequency radio transmissions, such as
by aircraft trying to communicate with distant traffic control towers.
Most commercial aircraft can use satellite transmission as backup, said
Jonathan Lash, a forecaster at the center.</p>
<p>Satellite operators might have trouble tracking their spacecraft, and
power grids could also see some “induced current” in their lines, though
nothing they can’t handle, he said.</p>
<p>“For the general public, if you have clear skies at night and you are
at higher latitudes, this would be a great opportunity to see the skies
light up,” Lash said.</p>
<p>Every 11 years, the sun’s magnetic field flips, meaning its north and
south poles switch positions. Solar activity changes during that cycle,
and it’s now near its most active, called the solar maximum.</p>
<p>During such times, geomagnetic storms of the type that arrived Sunday
can hit Earth a few times a year, Lash said. During solar minimum, a few
years may pass between storms.</p>
<p>In December, the biggest solar flare in years disrupted radio
communications.</p>

<h2 id="new-england-shovels-out-after-major-snowstorm">New England
Shovels Out After Major Snowstorm</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BOSTON — Hardy souls across New England were spending their Sunday
shoveling out after a major storm dumped more than 60 centimeters of
snow in some areas, causing multiple road accidents, downing power lines
and leaving hundreds of thousands across the Northeast without
electricity. </p>
<p>Road conditions were dangerous Saturday night for crews seeking to
restore power, according to Central Maine Power, the state’s largest
utility, which said the company’s focus overnight was responding to
emergency calls and making downed power lines safe. </p>
<p>As of daylight Sunday, crews began assessing and clearing damage to
begin widespread power restoration efforts. The company said it expected
a multiday effort in areas hardest hit by the storm. </p>
<p>“Damage to trees, poles and wires was significant overnight on
Saturday, and our assessors are taking stock of the damage today so we
can begin restoring power to our customers as quickly and as safely as
possible,” said Jon Breed of Central Maine Power. </p>
<p>Police across the Northeast reported hundreds of traffic accidents as
cars spun out and drivers grappled with icy road conditions. </p>
<p>As the storm was winding down, about 200,000 customers were without
power in Maine and another 80,000 or so without power in New
Hampshire. </p>
<p>Breed said that ahead of the storm, the company pre-staged 150 crews
across its service area and another 200 crews were arriving Sunday. </p>
<p>Versant, Maine’s second-largest utility, reported about 15,000
outages Sunday morning, compared with 188,000 reported by Central
Maine. </p>
<p>Zack Taylor, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service, said
heavy snowfall from the storm stretched across the region, including
upstate and northern New York through Vermont, New Hampshire, and most
of Maine. </p>
<p>Many areas saw totals of 20 to 30 centimeters of snow, but there was
a localized area that saw more than 60 centimeters. </p>
<p>Some of the highest totals exceeded 76 centimeters in south central
Vermont. </p>
<p>“So overall, it was a pretty significant winter storm and for some
areas that was some of the most snow they’ve seen all winter with a
single storm,” Taylor said. </p>
<p>Major cities from Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, to Philadelphia,
New York and Boston saw heavy rain and flooding. </p>
<p>In New York, more than 90,000 customers were without power Sunday
morning. Areas north of New York City were among the hardest hit,
according to online maps from National Grid and PowerOutage.us, a power
outage tracking website. </p>
<p>The combination of sleet, freezing rain and heavy, wet snow that took
down trees and power lines was also blamed for hundreds of delayed and
canceled flights at area airports. </p>
<p>In New York City, a flood watch and wind advisory were in place until
2 a.m. Sunday, and flooding affected subway service. Rainwater also
closed part of the Cross Island Parkway in Queens as police warned
motorists about standing water on roadways throughout the city. </p>
<p>In Lodi, New Jersey, flooding from the Saddle River inundated nearby
roads. </p>
<p>Taylor said another significant winter storm is evolving in the West
and will continue through Monday across much of the Rockies, Plains and
in the upper Midwest.</p>
<p>That system is expected to bring heavy snowfall across portions of
Wisconsin, Minnesota, much of the Dakotas and even down into Nebraska
and western Kansas with the potential of 20 to 30 centimeters of snow,
with higher amounts across the eastern Dakotas and portions of central
Minnesota, he added.</p>

<h2 id="ai-art-is-not-generative-art">AI art is not generative art</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-25, from: Lean Rada’s blog</p>
<p>
<strong>AI art is not <em>generative art</em></strong> (clickbait
title). While the technical definition says that one is a subset of the
other, I think it’s useful to distinguish between these two categories.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Why I’m writing this in the first place —</strong> Starting
2022, the term “generative art” had been progressively becoming
synonymous with art produced by AI text-to-image systems. As a consumer
and producer of (traditional) generative art, it was becoming a bit
annoying to browse generative art content on the internet. Whether
through tags like <code>#generativeart</code> or communities like
<code>r/generative</code>, spaces are being flooded with AI-generated
images which I and many others are not interested in. End rant.
</p>
<p>
<span>In 2024, things are a bit different. AI art is now commonly
referred to as ‘AI art’. I shouldn’t have procrastinated writing this
post for so long.</span>
</p>
<p>
There are also cases where generative artists are pressured to relabel
their art, so as to not be mistaken for being AI (and avoid the silly AI
witch hunts). It’s an unfortunate niche pressured to be nichey-er.
</p>
<p>
At this point you may be asking, what’s the difference anyway? Well,
that’s the point of this post. It’s kinda like animals vs humans. While
technically &amp; scientifically, humans are (a subset of) animals; in
daily life “animals” usually mean non-human animals, as in “animal
lover” and “animal rights”. I digress.

The Perceptron
</h3>
<p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Rosenblatt">Frank
Rosenblatt</a> built a relatively simple neural network that can be
trained, called the <em>perceptron</em>.
</p>
<p>
The perceptron was designed for image recognition. The perceptron looks
at some input (an image) and decides from a set of pre-learned classes
of images, which kind of image it is.

Conceptual art
</h3>
<p>
Artist
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_LeWitt#Wall_drawings">Sol
LeWitt</a> started doing something called wall drawings, sets of
instructions that produce abstract drawings. These can be thought of as
precursors to generative art.
</p>
<blockquote>
“<strong>Wall Drawing #797.</strong> <i>The first drafter has a black
marker and makes an irregular horizontal line near the top of the wall.
Then the second drafter tries to copy it (without touching it) using a
red marker. The third drafter does the same, using a yellow marker. The
fourth drafter does the same using a blue marker. Then the second
drafter followed by the third and fourth copies the last line drawn
until the bottom of the wall is reached.</i>”

“The idea becomes a machine that makes the art.” (Paragraphs on
Conceptual Art, 1967) It’s not quite <em>generative art</em> but it’s
close. Besides, LeWitt called it something else: <strong>‘conceptual
art’</strong>.

Code art

<p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_Moln%C3%A1r">Vera
Molnár</a> brought us closer to modern generative art by actually using
computers and writing code to generate artworks.

<h3>
AI winter ⛄
</h3>
<p>
The limitations of relatively primitive AI and weak computing power back
then resulted in massive disappointment about AI. Budgets were cut.
R&amp;D slowed down. Hype was lost.
</p>
<p>
The Perceptron did not achieve self-awareness.
</p>
1990s
<p>
Since 1990s, artists began meeting in generative art conferences and the
artistic community started converging on a shared definition of
generative art.
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Generative art —</strong> work that has been produced by the
execution, usually by a computer system, of a set of rules or procedures
determined by the artist.
</blockquote>

<h3>
Deep learning
</h3>
<p>
The intersection of advancements in computing power, improved machine
learning algorithms, and huge ever-growing datasets of digital things
resulted in bigger and better neural networks. The great potential of AI
was reignited. The start of the <strong>deep learning
revolution</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Image recognition, picture captioning, automated language translation,
text-to-speech, speech-to-text, etc. got seriously buffed.
</p>

<span>Google’s DeepDream exploits image recognition feeding into digital
pareidolia. It can be considered early AI art, but it’s quite different
from modern AI art.</span>
<h3>
Generative networks
</h3>
<p>
Due to deep learning, we had advancements in generative networks, which
are networks that can generate new data on their own instead of simply
being a complex input-output mapping.
</p>
<p>
This appears to be the start of the <strong>image synthesis</strong>
wave.

<h3>
Text to image
</h3>
<p>
The first modern text-to-image model was introduced.
</p>
<p>
It was called <strong>alignDRAW</strong>.
</p>
<p>
It can generate images from <em>natural language descriptions</em>,
making these machines massively accessible as the general public could
simply type in what they wanted to see.

was revealed by OpenAI. Another text-to-image model, and it became
famous. (Or, rather it was made famous by “DALL-E mini” which was
<em>viral</em>.)

Meanwhile, 2022 saw a burst of NFTs, most of which have been associated
with generative art.
</p>
<p>
Honestly, some of them are on the borderline shallow end of generative
art, Mad Libs-style images generated from shufflings of pre-drawn
hairstyles, sunglasses, and clothes. Automated dress-up. They are more
akin to the

Today, we see different techniques and tools to make generative art,
from straight up canvas coding, to frameworks like

Tools to make AI art and images have been heavily commercialised, with

and Midjourney. There are also local models for advanced users and
tinkerers.

<p>
So. AI art is a relatively new movement borne out of general image
synthesizers. This was made possible since visual artworks are images
too. Meanwhile, there have been decades of development and refinement in
(traditional) generative art, techniques, and algorithms.
</p>
<p>
The terminology may overlap (generative networks ~ generative art), but
these are just labels. You may call them whatever you want, but they’re
still <strong>separate art movements that cannot be historically
reconciled</strong>.
</p>
<p>
<span>By the way, I don’t care if you want to call them ‘art’ or not.
That’s not the point of this post. If it bothers you, please imagine
that all instances of the word ‘art’ were replaced with ‘image’. Same
for the word ‘artist’.</span>

<p>
OK so, whatever sure, history is in the past. Why don’t we look at it in
terms of what artists are doing today. What do they do? What do they
practise to improve?
</p>
<h3 id="unique-skills">
Unique skills

<p>
Both practices involve some unique skills that are not in common with
the other. They each have their own defining skills.

<p>
<strong>Generative art</strong> involves programming and uses math
(usually geometry or trigonometry) to create graphics. A good
undertanding of functions and their domains and ranges and how they
compose together is essential, especially when utilising random number
generators.
</p>
<img srcset="/notes/ai-art-not-generative-art/math_664.generated.png 664w" sizes=" 664px" alt="" src="https://leanrada.com/notes/ai-art-not-generative-art/math.png?ref=rss" spec="100% [664) 664" loading="lazy" width="100%" height="">

<p>
Beyond these core skills, there are a lot of areas generative artists
could expand into, like graph theory, simulations, fractals, image
processing, and other algorithms.

<p>
<strong>AI art</strong>, on the other hand, is heavy on prompt
engineering. It could be as simple as writing English descriptions, or
as precise as inputting parameterised labels if the tool allows for it.
</p>
<p><b><u>Prompt:</u></b> Dog, (Artist Name, Artist Name), Masterpiece,

<br><b><u>Negative prompt:</u></b> un-detailed skin, semi-realistic,

Steps: 50, Sampler: Euler a, CFG scale: 7.0, Seed: 1579799523, Face
restoration, Size: 512x512</p>
<pre><code>        &lt;span&gt;Example prompt with advanced parameters (e.g. for StableDiffusion)&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Beyond writing prompts, there are several tools that allow more control
like influencing certain compositional elements. AI artists could also
train or fine-tune models by curating image-label datasets as extra
training data.
</p>
<img srcset="/notes/ai-art-not-generative-art/control_664.generated.png 664w" sizes=" 664px" alt="" src="https://leanrada.com/notes/ai-art-not-generative-art/control.png?ref=rss" spec="100% [664) 664" loading="lazy" width="100%" height="">

<p>
There seems to be little to no transferable skills between these
practices. Sure, you can program some scripts to automate parts of an AI
art workflow, or add an AI filter step to an otherwise
procedurally-generated image. But there is no inherent overlap.
</p>
<p>
At the highest level, it is the difference between computer science vs
data science. At the lowest, it is the difference between coding and
writing English.
</p>
<p>
That’s why you can’t just ask an AI artist to please create an
interactive audio-reactive visualisation for your music video, or
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cityartsydney.com.au/artwork/high-water/">a
public art installation that reacts to the weather</a>. Likewise, you
can’t expect a generative artist to easily generate photorealistic art
in seconds.
</p>
<h3 id="skills-in-common">
Skills in common
</h3>
<p>
One big thing that’s common between these practices is the need to
curate. Since both practices involve chaos and randomness, a curation
step is almost always required before finishing a work. Curation
requires artistic vision, which could be considered a skill in itself.
</p>
<table aria-label="Venn-diagram showing curation &amp; artistic vision in the intersection between Generative artists and AI artists">

            &lt;/tbody&gt;
          &lt;/table&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
<strong>What’s curation?</strong> As one finishes a piece, they usually
generate multiple outputs by running the process with different seeds or
starting parameters. These produce different variations, from which the
best one(s) are selected for publishing, discarding the rest. That’s
curation.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, you might refine and iterate your prompt / program until
the generated outputs satisfy your artistic vision.
</p>

<span>AI image generators usually generate multiple outputs at a time
for you to curate.</span>
<p>
It could be argued that having artistic vision and doing iterations are
pretty common to all arts, and so those alone don’t make generative art
and AI art any more similar to each other than any other art.
</p>
<p>
<span><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I’m not very good at AI image
generation. I don’t have first-hand experience of the advanced skills
that I mentioned like fancy prompt engineering or fine-tuning. (Though I
did train a different type of
<a target="_blank" href="https://leanrada.com/wares/pong-ai?ref=rss">neural
network</a> before).</span>
</p>
<p>
Overall, the significant differences in skillsets mean that
<strong>generative artists and AI artists are not
interchangeable</strong>, and the same should go for their respective
arts.
</p>
<h2 id="the-process">
The process
</h2>
<p>
Finally, let’s attack the subject from the POV of processes and systems.
</p>
<p>
Setting aside the question of whether Art is Product or Process, let us
indulge in these animations of art in the process of being products.
</p>
<video src="https://leanrada.com/notes/ai-art-not-generative-art/diffusion.mp4?ref=rss" muted autoplay loop aria-label>

Video: | Source: /notes/ai-art-not-generative-art/flowers.mp4 </video>
<span>Generative art being formed via procedural strokes</span>
<p>
Most modern AI image generators are based on diffusion models — they
form images via <strong>‘denoising’</strong>. The animation above (left)
shows the sequence of steps to progressively denoise a pure noise image
into something coherent based on a prompt. The prompt for the above
generation specifically was <i>‘cherry blossom branches against a clear
blue sky’</i>.
</p>
<p>
The denoising process is a black box, an inscrutable network of billions
of artificial neurons trained to generate coherent arrays of pixels.
</p>
<p>
Generative art algorithms, on the other hand, are relatively more
hand-crafted, less magical. Explicit instructions are written to draw
every element in the piece. This is apparent in the above animation
(right) where each stroke is individually drawn according to the
artist’s rules. <i>This particular animation was from
<strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/the-soul-of-flowers">The
Soul of Flowers</a></strong> by Che-Yu Wu.</i>
</p>
<p>
In fact, it’s impossible to not have total control of the art because
programming is precise. You have to artificially create <em>whim</em>
(i.e. randomness) to produce dynamic results. For example, a quivering
brush stroke must be backed by a mathematical rule such as Gaussian or
Brownian noise.
</p>
<p>
It comes down to the explainability or transparency of the process. One
is a black box. The other is literally the instructions to create the
art. The level of control is just a consequence of the intelligibility
of the process. It’s easier to control something that is understandable.
</p>
<p>
On an opposite note, AI artists can be thought of as high-level artistic
directors who don’t concern themselves with the rendering of mid- to
low-level details. Unlike AI art, generative artists must always specify
the exact procedure for both the broad strokes and the fine details.
</p>
<h3 id="system-diagrams">
System diagrams
</h3>
<p>
Beyond the processes themselves, art interacts with the context of its
creation. And there is a lot to unpack here, especially for AI art. I’ll
use diagrams to illustrate the context of the creation process.
</p>
<img srcset="/notes/ai-art-not-generative-art/gen-system_664.generated.png 664w" sizes=" 664px" alt="" src="https://leanrada.com/notes/ai-art-not-generative-art/gen-system.png?ref=rss" spec="100% [664) 664" loading="lazy" width="100%" height="">
<span>The generative artist writes the program that renders the piece of
art</span>
<p>
<strong>In the generative art process,</strong> there are three
components at the minimum: the artist, the program, and the rendered
output.
</p>
<p>
They may use libraries or frameworks as part of the program, but the
artist ultimately writes the specific steps or rules which the program
would execute at a certain level of abstraction.
</p>
<img srcset="/notes/ai-art-not-generative-art/ai-system_664.generated.png 664w" sizes=" 664px" alt="" src="https://leanrada.com/notes/ai-art-not-generative-art/ai-system.png?ref=rss" spec="100% [664) 664" loading="lazy" width="100%" height="">
<span>The AI artist prompts the model trained from the dataset to
produce the piece of art</span>
<p>
<strong>In AI art,</strong> there are four components to the process at
the minimum: the artist, the model, the rendered output, and <em>the
dataset</em>.
</p>
<p>
Comparing the generative art process with the AI art process, there is
an immediate difference. Unlike AI art, <strong>generative art don’t
need datasets</strong>.
</p>
<p>
And it’s a controversial thing, <strong>the dataset</strong>. The data
used to train a text-to-image model can consist of billions of images,
usually scraped from the internet and includes other artworks by other
artists.
</p>
<p>
If you consider that the model has been influenced by a lot of other
images on the web, then the question of how important the AI artist’s
influence over the final piece is raised. <em>Was that chiaroscuro an
artistic choice, or an emergent byproduct of the model? Were those bold
paint strokes intentional, or just some style produced by the
model?</em>
</p>
<p>
In AI art, there is confusion over which elements were expressed by the
artist and which by the machine. Utlimately, there comes a question of
who worked out the art of the artwork.
</p>
<p>
Leaving the contentious topic of datasets aside, there is another point,
but not as essential, of <strong>who authored the main program</strong>.
Who created the most crucial piece of the system?
</p>
<p>
Generative art programs are usually created by the artists themselves,
while AI art programs are usually created by AI researchers (plus
datasets), only to be used as a product by AI artists. One makes the
machine that makes the art, the other uses a machine to make the art.
</p>
<p>
Of course, AI artists could train (not just fine-tune!) their own
models, if they have a big enough dataset and some machine learning
know-how. That’s why I said it’s not an essential point.
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">
Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
The point is that these are separate <em>art mediums</em>. Or <em>art
movements</em>, if you will. The histories, the crafts, and the
processes point to the same conclusion — they are no more similar than
oil painting is to photography, or a film director to an animator.

to Speak to Media for 1st Time Since Illegal Gambling, Theft Allegations
Against Interpreter</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Shohei Ohtani plans to speak to the media Monday for
the first time since the illegal gambling and theft allegations
involving the Los Angeles Dodgers star and his interpreter emerged
during the team’s trip to South Korea.</p>
<p>The interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, was fired by the Dodgers last week
when the team opened the season with two games against the San Diego
Padres in Seoul.</p>
<p>Manager Dave Roberts endorsed Ohtani addressing the matter publicly.
He said it was the two-way superstar’s decision to do so.</p>
<p>“It’s the right thing to do,” Roberts said. “I’m happy he’s going to
speak and speak to what he knows and give his thoughts on the whole
situation. I think it will give us all a little bit more clarity.”</p>
<p>Mizuhara was let go from the team following reports from the Los
Angeles Times and ESPN about his alleged ties to an illegal bookmaker
and claims from Ohtani’s attorneys that the Japanese star had been the
victim of a “massive theft.”</p>
<p>Major League Baseball has opened an investigation of the matter. The
Internal Revenue Service has confirmed that Mizuhara and Mathew Bowyer,
the alleged illegal bookmaker in Orange County, California, are under
criminal investigation.</p>
<p>Ohtani made only a brief appearance in the Dodgers clubhouse before
Sunday’s Freeway Series opener against his former team, the Los Angeles
Angels. The teams are playing three exhibition games before the Dodgers
host St. Louis in their home opener on Thursday.</p>
<p>Ohtani was set to bat second as the designated hitter at Dodger
Stadium. He’s also expected to play Monday and Tuesday in Anaheim, where
he was a two-time AL MVP before leaving the Angels as a free agent to
sign a record $700 million, 10-year contract with the Dodgers in
December.</p>
<p>Roberts said Ohtani has not addressed his teammates as a group.</p>
<p>“I think that he’s had one-off conversations with players,” Roberts
said.</p>
<p>The manager said he checked in with Ohtani to see how he’s doing.</p>
<p>“He’s kind of business as usual,” Roberts said.</p>
<p>Ohtani has a double locker in the Dodgers clubhouse located between
the shower room and fellow Japanese pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who is
slated to make his second start of the season on Saturday against
St. Louis.</p>
<p>Extra security was posted in the jammed clubhouse on Sunday. Besides
the players and a horde of media, eight temporary lockers were set up at
one end for minor leaguers brought over from Arizona for the Freeway
Series.</p>
<p>Overhead televisions were tuned to men’s NCAA Tournament games,
baseball and horse racing, with former Los Angeles Dodgers catcher Paul
Lo Duca offering TV handicapping tips on the day’s races.</p>
<p>The MLB gambling policy is posted in every clubhouse. Betting on
baseball — legally or not — is punishable with a one-year ban from the
sport. The penalty for betting on other sports illegally is at the
commissioner’s discretion. Sports gambling is illegal in California,
even as 38 states and the District of Columbia allow some form of
it.</p>
<p>“The mood in the room is get ready for baseball because I don’t hear
a lot of conversations and speculation,” Roberts said. “That’s why I
think tomorrow is going to be good for everyone.”</p>

The cryotron, a superconductive switch, almost revolutionized computing.
It’s one of those fascinating near misses. In this episode we are
talking about the history of the cryotron, how the NSA and
supercomputing factors into the mix, and the current state of research
into the topic. Did the NSA actually construct a supercomputer that ran
in a vat of liquid helium? The answer is… maybe?

<p>Never thought I’d be so glad to see the
<a href="https://xmlrpc.com/">xml-rpc site</a> back up and running. I
found out about it being off by someone sending an email asking if they
could buy the domain from me. Otherwise I’m not sure I would have
noticed. The whole idea is to put these static sites in a safe place and
forget about it. But clearly there are no safe places and someday you
might get dragged back to try to debug some work you did a bunch of

<p>date: 2024-03-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>I saw this on a Linus Tech Tips video today, and it’s pretty neat:
the Khadas Mind is a tiny computer powered by an Intel Core i5-1340P or
Core i7-1360P, but it has a souped-up PCIe connector at the bottom that
allows you to hook it up to all kinds of other devices, like a graphics
card, a dock, and so on. It looks slick and quite user-friendly, and
according to the LTT video, the company intends to release the specs for
the connector so that third parties can hook into it as well, but a
promise is just that – a promise. It’s way too early to tell if this
will go anywhere – past attempts would suggest that sadly, it won’t –
but that doesn’t mean it’s not an incredibly awesome and seemingly
workable implementation of the modular PC idea.</p>

wallets and the “only Apple Pay does this” mythology</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>I hope what you take away from this post is that while Apple Pay is a
great way to pay for things and that Apple did a great job mainstreaming
digital wallets like this, what they do is not unique in the industry.
DPANs are great for making it harder to track one person’s purchases
across multiple merchants and they make customers less at risk in the
event of a data breach of payment card info. ↫ Matt Birchler The gist of
the article is that all the things Apple claims are unique about Apple
Pay are really not unique at all, and quite a few things Apple touts are
just flat-out lies, such as merchants being unable to know what you buy
or people being unable to track you when you use Apple Pay. Other
digital wallets, from Google, Samsung, and others, work in the exact
same way Apple Pay does, and even banks and similar companies implement
their payment systems the way Apple Pay does. It’s a case study in how
Apple’s marketing and PR bloggers manage to perpetuate a myth solely
because so many people just assume it must be true. Apple wouldn’t lie,
right?</p>

id="another-day-another-paean-of-praise-for-the-amigas-1980s-pre-emptive-multitasking-gui">Another
day, another paean of praise for the Amiga’s 1980s pre-emptive
multitasking GUI</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-24, from: Liam on Linux</p>
<div>
Yes, the Amiga offered a GUI with pre-emptive multitasking, as early as
1985 or so. And it was affordable: you didn’t even need a hard
disk.<br /><span class="commtext c00">
<p>
The thing is, that’s only part of the story.
</p>
<p>
There’s a generation of techies who are about 40 now who don’t remember
this stuff well, and some of the older ones have forgotten with time but
don’t realise. I had some greybeard angrily telling me that floppy
drives were IDE recently. Senile idiot.
</p>
<p>
Anyway.
</p>
<p>
Preemptive multitasking is only part of the story. Lots of systems had
it. Windows <i>2.0</i> could do preemptive multitasking – but only of
DOS apps, and only in the base 640kB of RAM, so it was pretty useless.
</p>
<p>
It sounds good but it’s not. Because the other key ingredient is memory
protection. You need both, together, to have a compelling deal. Amiga
and Windows 2.x/3.x only had the preemption part, they had no hardware
memory management or protection to go with it. (Windows 3.x <i>when
running on a 386</i> and also <i>when given &gt;2MB RAM</i> could do
some, for DOS apps, but not much.)
</p>
<p>
Having multiple pre-emptive tasks is relatively easy if they are all in
the same memory space, but it’s horribly horribly unstable.
</p>
<p>
Also see: microkernels. In size terms, AmigaOS was a microkernel, but a
microkernel without memory protection is not such a big deal, because
the hard part of a microkernel is the interprocess communication, and if
they can just do that by reading and writing each other’s RAM it’s
trivially easy but also trivially insecure and trivially unstable.
</p>
<p>
RISC OS had pre-emptive multitasking too… but only of text-only
command-line windows, and there were few CLI RISC OS apps so it was
mostly useless. At least on 16-bit Windows there were lots of DOS apps
so it was vaguely useful, if they’d fit into memory. Which only trivial
ones would. Windows 3 came along very late in the DOS era, and by then,
most DOS apps didn’t fit into memory <i>on their own</i> one at a time.
I made good money optimising DOS memory around 1990-1992 because I was
very good at it and without it most DOS apps didn’t fit into 500-550kB
any more. So two of them in 640kB? Forget it.
</p>
<p>
Preemption is clever. It lets apps that weren’t designed to multitask do
it.
</p>
<p>
But it’s also <i>slow</i>. Which is <i>why</i> RISC OS didn’t do it.
Co-op is much quicker which is also why OSes like RISC OS and 16-bit
Windows chose it for their GUI apps: because GUI apps strained the
resources of late-1980s/very-early-1990s computers. So you had 2
choices:
</p>
<p>
• The Mac and GEM way: don’t multitask at all.
</p>
<p>
• The 16-bit Windows and RISC OS way: multitask cooperatively, and hope
nothing goes wrong.
</p>
<p>
Later, notably, MacOS 7-8-9 and Falcon MultiTOS/MiNT/MagiC etc added
coop multitasking to single-tasking GUI OSes. I used MacOS 8.x and 9.x
<i>a lot</i> and I really liked them. They were extraordinarily usable
to an extent Mac OS X has never and will never catch up with.
</p>
<p>
But the good thing about owning a Mac in the 1990s was that at least one
thing in your life was guaranteed to go down on you every single day.

Harris Tours Bloodstained Building Where 2018 Parkland Massacre
Happened</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Parkland, Florida — PARKLAND, Fla. (AP) — Vice President Kamala
Harris toured on Saturday the bloodstained classroom building where the
2018 Parkland high school massacre happened, then announced a program to
assist states that have laws allowing police to temporarily seize guns
from people judges have found to be dangerous.</p>
<p>Harris saw bullet-pocked walls and floors still covered in dried
blood and broken glass left behind from the Feb. 14, 2018, attack at
Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that killed 14 students and three
staff members and wounded 17.</p>
<p>The halls and classrooms inside the three-story structure remain
strewn with shoes left behind by fleeing students and wilted Valentine’s
Day flowers and balloons. Textbooks, laptop computers, snacks and papers
remain on desks. She was told about each victim who died.</p>
<p>“Frozen in time,” Harris said repeatedly about what she saw. She was
accompanied on the tour by victims’ family members, some of them pushing
for more spending on school safety and others for stronger gun laws.</p>
<p>Harris, who leads the new White House Office of Gun Violence
Prevention, said there are lessons to be learned from Parkland, both for
stopping school shootings before they happen and mitigating them with
measures such as making sure classroom doors don’t lock from the outside
as they did at Stoneman Douglas. She pointed out that shootings are a
leading cause of death for children and teenagers.</p>
<p>“We must be willing to have the courage to say that on every level,
whether you talk about changing laws or changing practices and
protocols, that we must do better,” Harris said.</p>
<p>At Stoneman Douglas, former student Nikolas Cruz, then 19, fired
about 140 shots from his AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle during his
six-minute attack, moving methodically from the first floor, through the
second and onto the third.</p>
<p>He pleaded guilty in 2021. He was sentenced to life in prison in 2022
after his jury couldn’t unanimously agree he deserved a death sentence,
angering the victims’ families.</p>
<p>The building was preserved so his jury could tour it. It has loomed
over the 3,600-student school from behind a temporary fence since the
school reopened two weeks after the shooting. It is scheduled to be
demolished this summer. No replacement plan has been announced.</p>
<p>Following Harris’ tour, she announced a $750 million grant program to
provide technical assistance and training to Florida and the other 20
states that have similar “red flag laws.”</p>
<p>Florida’s law allows police officers, with a judge’s permission, to
temporarily seize guns belonging to anyone shown to be a danger to
others or themselves. The statute has been used more than 12,000 times
since it was enacted six years ago in response to the Parkland
shooting.</p>
<p>Harris also called on both Congress and states without red flag laws
to adopt them. The Biden administration has called for a national red
flag law.</p>
<p>Cruz had a long history of troubling and bizarre behavior before the
shooting, including animal torture. In the weeks before the shooting, he
had been reported to local law enforcement and the FBI by people fearing
he was planning a mass shooting, but no action was taken. He legally
purchased 10 guns in the 17 months between his 18th birthday and the
massacre.</p>
<p>“Red flag laws are simply designed to give communities a vehicle
through which they can share … information about the concern of
potential danger or the crying out for help,” Harris said.</p>
<p>Sen. Rick Scott, a Republican who signed Florida’s red flag law as
governor, issued a statement Saturday calling the Biden administration’s
proposed national red flag law “radical,” saying it would be modeled on
California’s statute and strip gun owners of their rights. California’s
law is broader than Florida’s as it allows family members, employers and
others to initiate the process, but the removal also has to be approved
by a judge.</p>
<p>California’s law “abandons due process to more quickly and easily
take constitutional rights away from law-abiding Americans. That is
unacceptable,” Scott said.</p>
<p>Harris’ tour was the latest by elected officials and law enforcement
and education leaders in recent months. Education Secretary Miguel
Cardona toured it in January, and several members of Congress, mostly
Democrats, have gone through since law enforcement returned custody of
the building to the school district last summer. FBI Director
Christopher Wray and Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle visited
the building in recent days.</p>
<p>“It is important to bring these people through the building so they
can see not only the horror that still exists there, but so that we can
point to the exact things that failed,” said Tony Montalto, president of
Stand With Parkland, the group that represents most of the victims’
families. His 14-year-old daughter Gina died in the shooting.</p>
<p>Some Stoneman Douglas families who participate in the tours, along
with Harris and President Joe Biden, want the sale of AR-15s and similar
guns banned, as they were from 1994 to 2004, but there isn’t sufficient
support in Congress. Opponents, which include other victims’ families,
argue that such a ban would violate the Second Amendment and do little
to stem gun violence.</p>
<p>Linda Beigel Schulman said the tour showed Harris the carnage a mass
shooting creates — it no longer will be an abstract concept for her.
Beigel Schulman’s 35-year-old son, geography teacher Scott Beigel, was
killed as he ushered students to safety in his classroom. The papers he
was grading when the shooting began remain on his desk.</p>
<p>“She understands how important gun violence prevention is for us,”
Beigel Schulman said of the vice president. “But when you go into the
actual building and see what actually happened, it doesn’t matter that
it is six years later. It really does something to you.”</p>
<p>Max Schachter, whose son Alex died in the shooting, uses the tours to
persuade officials to enact school safety measures such as making doors
and windows bullet-resistant. Alex, 14, died from shots fired through
the window of his classroom’s door.</p>
<p>Schachter said while there is disagreement over gun laws, school
safety brings the sides together. He pointed particularly to a fall
visit by Utah officials, leading to that state enacting a $100 million
plan to harden its schools.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t save Alex. But every time I have officials come through
that building, lives are saved,” Schachter said.</p>

US, Micro-Apartments Back as Need for Affordable Housing Soars</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SEATTLE — Every part of Barbara Peraza-Garcia and her family’s
single-room apartment in Seattle has a double or even triple
purpose.</p>
<p>The 17-square-meter room is filled with an air mattress where she,
her partner and their children, ages 2 and 4, sleep. It’s also where
they play or watch TV. At mealtimes, it becomes their dining room.</p>
<p>It’s a tight squeeze for the family of asylum seekers from Venezuela.
But at $900 a month —more than $550 less than the average studio in
Seattle — the micro-apartment with a bare-bones bathroom and shared
kitchen was just within their budget and gave them a quick exit from
their previous arrangement sleeping on the floor of a church.</p>
<p>“It’s warm. We can cook ourselves. We have a private bathroom. It’s
quiet,” said Peraza-Garcia, whose family came to the U.S. to escape
crime in Venezuela and so she could access vital medication to combat
cysts on her kidney. “We can be here as a family now.”</p>
<p>Boarding houses that rented single rooms to low-income, blue-collar
or temporary workers were prevalent across the U.S. in the early 1900s.
Known as single room occupancy units, or SROs, they started to disappear
in the postwar years amid urban renewal efforts and a focus on suburban
single-family housing.</p>
<p>Now the concept is reappearing — with the trendy name of
“micro-apartment” and aimed at a much broader array of residents — as
cities buffeted by surging homelessness struggle to make housing more
affordable.</p>
<p>“If you’re a single person and you want a low-cost place to live,
that’s as cheap as you’re going to get without trying to find a
subsidized apartment,” said Dan Bertolet, senior director of housing and
urbanism for the non-profit research center Sightline Institute.</p>
<p>The Pacific Northwest is a leader in the resurgence of this form of
affordable housing. Oregon last year passed a bill opening the door for
micro-apartments and Washington state lawmakers this year did the same,
starting to clear red tape that for years has limited construction of
the tiny units, which are about a third the size of an average studio
apartment.</p>
<p>The Washington bill, which was signed this week by Democratic
Gov. Jay Inslee after receiving nearly unanimous support in the
Legislature, would require most cities to allow micro-apartments in
residential buildings with at least six units, according to the
Department of Commerce. It takes effect in late 2025.</p>
<p>The legislation is an effort to counteract skyrocketing housing
prices and, in the Seattle area, one of the nation’s highest rates of
homelessness, as well as a critical housing shortage.</p>
<p>Extremely low-income renters — those below federal poverty guidelines
or earning 30% of the area median income — face a shortage of 7.3
million affordable rental homes, according to a National Low Income
Housing Coalition report published last week. Such households account
for 11 million — or nearly one-quarter — of renters nationwide, the
report said.</p>
<p>Rep. Mia Gregerson, who sponsored Washington’s bill, said she
predicts the measure will lead to thousands of units being built in her
state, providing unsubsidized affordable housing to everyone from young
people getting their first apartment and elderly people downsizing to
those coming out of physical or mental health treatment.</p>
<p>“Government can’t close that gap all by itself, it has to have
for-profit, market-rate housing built all at the same time,” said
Gregerson, a Democrat.</p>
<p>The U.S. lost hundreds of thousands of SROs in the last half of the
20th century as associations with poverty and substandard accommodation
sparked restrictive zoning laws. Some cities outlawed their construction
altogether — a loss some housing experts say helped contribute to the
homelessness crisis.</p>
<p>Facing that crisis and a critical housing shortage, cities and states
across the nation are now shifting their stance.</p>
<p>In December, as her state grappled with a massive influx of migrants,
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced a $50 million program aimed at
repairing and renovating 500 SROs across the state. New York City lost
at least 70,000 such units between the early 20th century and 2014,
according to a report from New York University’s Furman Center.</p>
<p>But there is concern that this type of affordable housing is not an
ideal fit for an especially vulnerable group — families.</p>
<p>There are more than 3,800 unhoused families with children in the
Seattle area, among the highest in the nation, according to the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development 2023 one-night count.</p>
<p>Cities need to focus on building affordable housing that also
includes larger units, such as studios and one-bedroom apartments, said
Marisa Zapata, a land-use planning professor at Portland State
University.</p>
<p>“My biggest concern is that we will see them as the solution and not
do right by our community members by building the housing that people
want,” she said of micro-apartments.</p>
<p>The bill passed by Oregon lawmakers last year requires local
governments to allow single room occupancy units in areas zoned for
residential use. The provision took effect January 1.</p>
<p>Central City Concern, a Portland-based homeless services nonprofit,
leases more than 1,000 SRO units — both subsidized and not — to people
who are considered extremely low income. It helps people struggling to
access housing due to things like eviction histories and poor credit
scores.</p>
<p>The units have a median rent of $550 a month, making them a “vital
option” for people exiting homelessness or living on fixed incomes, such
as those with disabilities, said Sarah Holland, senior director of
supportive housing and employment. Over 80% of tenants were formerly
homeless, she said, and some have been living in their units for 30
years.</p>
<p>“As costs continue to escalate in Portland, it gives them the chance
to stay in their home,” she said.</p>
<p>Cheyenne Welbourne moved into one of the nonprofit’s micro-apartments
in downtown Portland last March after years of living on the streets.
The room, which has a curtained-off toilet and sink, is just big enough
to fit a single bed, a chair and a TV. But to him, it’s a treasured home
that he’s decorated with colorful lights, potted plants and action
figures. He uses the small kitchenette, which features an induction
cooktop, for making the tea he loves to drink.</p>
<p>“All I had was just me and my backpack, and that’s it,” he said. “I
was just happy to be in here and that I didn’t have to spend another
winter out there.”</p>
<p>“I just want a home, you know? A nice home, a decent home.”</p>
<p>Some experts hope the Pacific Northwest will inspire more states to
take similar steps.</p>
<p>“The alternatives are … people being in shelters, people being on the
street, people being doubled, tripled, quadrupled up,” said Vicki Been,
faculty director at New York University’s Furman Center and a law
professor.</p>
<p>For Peraza-Garcia’s family in Seattle, the tight squeeze is worth it
to be in the same complex as their cousins and within walking distance
of grocery stores, a park and preschools. They plan to spend the next
year in the micro-apartment and then move to a bigger place if they can
get good-paying jobs.</p>
<p>“We’re happy because we’re here in a quiet place where we can be
together as a family,” she said.</p>

City Wrestles With History of Discrimination Against Early Chinese
Immigrants</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Antioch, California — In 1939, after attending the Golden Gate
International Exposition in San Francisco, Alfred Chan and his friends
were headed back home to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.</p>
<p>“They got really hungry and decided to stop halfway in Antioch for a
meal,” his son Ron Chan said. But, the waitress refused to serve the
young men or even talk to them. They left the establishment an hour
later, hungry and humiliated.</p>
<p>Eighty-two years after that incident, Alfred Chan received an apology
delivered in person by Antioch Mayor Lamar Thorpe in November 2022.
Chan, a World War II veteran who served in the U.S. Navy and worked 38
years for the city of Oakland, died at age 98, about three months after
hearing those words.</p>
<p>“It helped close a bad moment in my father’s life,” Ron Chan said,
adding that it gave him peace to see his father’s closure as well. “An
apology may be just words that may not be enough to resolve all issues
from the past. But without that first step, we have no progress.”</p>
<p>In May 2021, Thorpe had issued a formal apology for Antioch’s
mistreatment of early Chinese immigrants, including the torching of
Chinatown and driving out its residents, which has been documented by
local newspapers and historians. Thorpe’s actions led to major cities
like San Jose, Los Angeles and San Francisco passing similar
resolutions.</p>
<p>The 2021 apology has also led to local residents and historians
delving deeper into the past and working to establish a Chinatown
Historic District, complete with murals and museum exhibits highlighting
the history and accomplishments of the community in Antioch.</p>
<p>Chinese laborers were among the early population in Antioch, which
was named in 1851. They likely numbered just under 100, said Lucy
Meinhardt, an Antioch Historical Society Museum board member. They
worked in farms, canneries and mines. They helped build river levees and
established a Chinatown where the city’s downtown now stands.</p>
<p>In the 19th century, Chinese people across California endured
discrimination such as wage disparity, bans on property ownership and
sundown laws that barred them from going outside after dark. Those
working and living around Antioch were no different.</p>
<p>In 1871, a massive fire wiped out several blocks of Antioch’s
Chinatown. The townspeople decided that a Chinese laundry needed to be
torn down to stop the blaze. Then in 1876, local newspapers reported
that another blaze was deliberately started to drive six Chinese women
who were allegedly prostitutes out of their homes. A Buddhist/Tao temple
also perished in the fire, Meinhardt said.</p>
<p>It’s become popular local lore that Antioch was a “sundown town” and
Chinese residents used tunnels to skirt the rules. Meinhardt says there
is no record of such a law “but it had to have been a practice if it
existed. I still suspect it existed.”</p>
<p>Before getting involved with the Antioch Historical Society and
becoming committee chair for its Chinese History Project, Hans Ho said
he had no idea a Chinatown once existed there. Chinese people were
undoubtedly treated as second-class citizens, said Ho, who emigrated
from Hong Kong in the 1960s.</p>
<p>“Regardless of which narrative you believe in, it is still an
atrocity because these people were expelled or persecuted without due
process of law and their houses were burned down,” he said.</p>
<p>He was also one of the representatives from the Chinese American
community to receive Thorpe’s apology, an act that moved him to
tears.</p>
<p>“I was shamelessly crying,” said Ho, who became visibly choked up
just recalling that moment. “It’s the most obvious means of
reconciliation that I’ve ever encountered.”</p>
<p>Today, the city of more than 111,000 is 25% white while Asians make
up 12%. Hispanic and Black residents are 35% and 20% of the population,
respectively. Making progress on Asian American representation in public
spaces remains an uphill struggle. Plans for a public memorial paying
tribute to early Chinese settlers is at a standstill after a consultant
recommended the city invest in more research.</p>
<p>Even creating a space for some materials related to Chinese residents
at the Antioch Historical Society Museum has gotten pushback.</p>
<p>“(One board member) said that they wanted this to be an ‘American’
museum,” said Dwayne Eubanks, a past president of the historical
society, who is African American. “I took umbrage to that.”</p>
<p>He held up a picture of his father in his Army uniform and told the
man: “This is an American.”</p>
<p>On Saturday, Eubanks, Meinhardt and Ho all attended the May We Gather
event in Antioch, which organizers described as the first national
memorial service and pilgrimage in response to anti-Asian violence.
Attendees, including the three local residents, walked meditatively with
Buddhist monks, nuns and lay leaders, around the city block where
Antioch’s Chinatown stood 150 years ago.</p>
<p>Ho said such events while educational, should guard against
portraying communities of color as victims and instead spotlight stories
of Asian American accomplishment in the face of stark adversity.
Somewhat agreeing with his friend, Eubanks pointed out that “healing is
a two-way street” and that those who hate must first understand and
acknowledge what happened.</p>
<p>“And then they have the opportunity to accept the medicine because
hate is a sickness,” he said. “We do not want this to happen to our
grandkids. We don’t want history to repeat itself.”</p>

<h2 id="what-is-gambling-addiction-and-how-widespread-is-it-in-us">What
Is Gambling Addiction and How Widespread Is It in US?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey — The firing of Los Angeles Dodgers star
Shohei Ohtani’s interpreter and close friend after allegations of
illegal gambling and theft from the Japanese baseball player is shining
renewed attention on compulsive gambling. </p>
<p>The team fired interpreter Ippei Mizuhara, who has been Ohtani’s
constant companion since the star came to the U.S in 2017, on Wednesday
after reports about his alleged ties to an illegal bookmaker and debts
well over $1 million. </p>
<p>The law firm representing Ohtani said in a statement that he had been
the victim of “massive theft.” </p>
<p>Mizuhara told ESPN this week that Ohtani knew nothing of his illegal
wagers on international soccer, the NBA, the NFL and college football.
Mizuhara said Ohtani was an innocent victim of his friend’s gambling
addiction. </p>
<p>What is problem gambling? </p>
<p>The National Council on Problem Gambling defines gambling addiction
as “gambling behavior that is damaging to a person or their family,
often disrupting their daily life and career.” </p>
<p>Gambling addiction is a recognized mental health diagnosis, and the
group says anyone who gambles can be at risk for developing a
problem. </p>
<p>Its symptoms include thinking about gambling all the time; feeling
the need to bet more money more often; going back to try to win money
back, known as “chasing losses”; feeling out of control; and continuing
to gamble despite negative consequences. </p>
<p>How widespread is it? </p>
<p>The council says about 2.5 million adults in the U.S. meet the
criteria of having a severe gambling problem. Another 5 million to 8
million people are considered to have mild or moderate gambling
problems. </p>
<p>The 800-GAMBLER hotline can offer help and referrals, and Gamblers
Anonymous also has resources and support for those with gambling
problems. </p>
<p>Where is sports betting legal? </p>
<p>Sports betting is legal in 38 U.S. states plus Washington, D.C.,
since a 2018 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that opened the floodgates to
legal wagering in a case brought by New Jersey. More than 80% of sports
betting is done online, using phones or laptops. </p>
<p>This week, at the start of the NCAA college basketball tournaments,
the American Gaming Association estimated that Americans would wager
$2.72 billion with legal outlets this year on the tournaments. </p>
<p>What are sports leagues doing about gambling? </p>
<p>Major professional sports leagues prohibit their players from
gambling, and many impose penalties including fines, suspensions and
lifetime bans for violations. </p>
<p>The most famous of these involves baseball star Pete Rose, the
sport’s all-time hits leader, who was banned for betting on games in
which his team was involved. </p>
<p>Baseball’s collective bargaining agreement includes an annual spring
training education program for players on safety and security, including
issues relating to sports betting and gambling. </p>
<p>This comes at the same time that the leagues — who bitterly fought
against legalizing sports betting beyond the four states that allowed it
before 2018 — have become business partners with the biggest gambling
outlets. Many teams and leagues have official sports betting partners
and allow gambling company advertising on their premises. A few have
even opened sports books at their stadiums. </p>
<p>Is betting legal in California or Japan? </p>
<p>Sports betting is not legal in California, despite several attempts
to have voters legalize it. In Japan, most forms of gambling are
prohibited, although it is allowed on horse racing, motor sports and
public races involving bicycles, power boats and motorcycles.</p>

id="climate-change-shrinks-nevadas-first-big-game-moose-hunt">Climate
Change Shrinks Nevada’s First Big-Game Moose Hunt</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>RENO, Nevada — In what will be a tiny big-game hunt for some of the
largest animals in North America, Nevada is planning its first-ever
moose hunting season this fall.</p>
<p>Wildlife managers say explosive growth in Nevada moose numbers over
the past five years, increasing to a population of more than 100,
justifies the handful of harvests planned.</p>
<p>Scientists say the experiment of sorts should also provide a
real-time peek at how the complexities of climate change affect
wildlife, and why these majestic — some say goofy-looking — mammals the
size of a horse have unexpectedly expanded their range into warmer
territory.</p>
<p>“Moose are newcomers to North America,” said Cody McKee, a Nevada
Department of Wildlife specialist.</p>
<p>The last deer species to cross the Bering Sea land bridge into Alaska
and Canada, McKee said the movement of moose into the Lower 48 has
occurred almost exclusively in the past 150 years.</p>
<p>“Their post-glacial range expansion isn’t really complete,” McKee
said. “And that’s what we’re currently seeing in Nevada right now, is
those moose are moving into the state and finding suitable habitat.”</p>
<p>Only a few Nevada moose, perhaps just one, will be killed across an
area larger than Massachusetts and New Jersey combined. But state
officials expect thousands of applications for the handful of hunting
tags, and it’s already controversial.</p>
<p>“Why a moose hunt at all?” Stephanie Myers of Las Vegas asked at a
recent wildlife commission meeting. “We want to see moose, view moose.
Not kill moose.”</p>
<p>The first moose was spotted in Nevada in the 1950s, not long before
the dim-witted cartoon character Bullwinkle made his television debut.
Only a handful of sightings followed for decades but started increasing
about 10 years ago.</p>
<p>By 2018, officials estimated there were 30 to 50, all in Nevada’s
northeast corner. But the population has more than doubled and experts
believe there’s enough habitat to sustain about 200, a level that could
be reached in three years.</p>
<p>Bryan Bird, Defenders of Wildlife’s Southwest program director, is
among the skeptics who suspect it’s a short-lived phenomenon.</p>
<p>“I believe the moose story is one of ‘ghost’ habitat or ‘ghost’ range
expansion. By that I mean, these animals are expanding into habitat that
may not be suitable in 50 years due to climate change,” Bird said.</p>
<p>Government biologists admit they don’t fully understand why the moose
have moved so far south, where seasonal conditions are warmer and drier
than they traditionally prefer.</p>
<p>“It seems to be opposite of where we would expect to see moose
expansion given their ecology,” said Marcus Blum, a Texas A&amp;M
University researcher hired to help assess future movement. He analyzed
aerial surveys, individual sightings and habitat to project growth
trends.</p>
<p>Standing 1.8 meters tall at the shoulder and weighing up to 453.5
kilograms, moose live in riparian areas where they munch on berry bushes
and aspen leaves along the edges of mountain forests native to the
northern half of Nevada.</p>
<p>They usually avoid places where temperatures regularly exceed 20
Celsius.</p>
<p>The Nevada study documented moose spending nearly half their time in
areas where that “thermal threshold” was exceeded about 150 days a year,
while climate change models suggest the threshold will be surpassed by
another 14 days annually by 2050, Blum said.</p>
<p>To be clear, the valleys beneath the snow-capped winter mountain
ranges with moose are 805 kilometers from the Las Vegas Strip in the
desert many people picture as Nevada.</p>
<p>Researchers have more questions than answers about why moose continue
to expand their range into Nevada where extended drought has taken a
toll on other wildlife, McKee said.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of speculation and questions about why they are here,
given concerns about the changing environment and how it’s probably
getting warmer and dryer,” McKee said. “Why is it that our extensive
drought cycles haven’t seemed to be affecting the moose population?”</p>
<p>Populations along the U.S.-Canada border have oscillated for more
than a century. Several states, from Idaho to Minnesota and Maine, have
dramatically reduced hunting quotas at times to allow populations to
recover.</p>
<p>Alaska is home to the vast majority of U.S. moose, upwards of
200,000, with about 7,000 harvests annually. Maine has nearly 70,000,
which is five times more than any other Lower 48 state, and issued 4,100
permits last year. Neighboring New Hampshire offered only 35 for
3,000-plus moose and Idaho issued about 500 for its 10,000 to
12,000.</p>
<p>No moose were observed in Washington state before the 1960s, but its
growing population now exceeds 5,000. The state issued three hunting
permits in 1977 and now tops 100 annually.</p>
<p>Nevada’s research suggests its population could sustain more harvests
than planned, McKee said, but “conservative is the name of the game
here.”</p>
<p>Aerial surveys are now backed by radio-tracking collars biologists
have fitted on four bull moose and nine cows since 2020. In some spots,
males significantly outnumber females. Removing a bull or two might
improve herd dynamics, he said.</p>
<p>The exact number of permits will be determined in the coming weeks,
but McKee anticipates no more than three. Only Nevadans can apply for
the inaugural hunt, which will help guide decisions about future
endeavors.</p>
<p>Successful hunters must present the skull and antlers for state
inspection within five days. That will give scientists more insight into
herd health, body conditions, disease and parasites.</p>
<p>Bill Nolan of Sparks, who first hunted ducks at age 12, says he
intends to apply for a chance he describes as “slim and none” to draw a
moose tag.</p>
<p>“For hunters, it would be like hitting the lottery,” he said.</p>

Takes Men’s World Figure Skating Crown in Record Performance</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MONTREAL — American figure skating star Ilia Malinin is a world
champion — and a world-record holder.</p>
<p>Malinin put on a dominant display that included a jaw-dropping six
quad jumps — including his patented quad axel — to snag the men’s
singles crown Saturday night at the world championships.</p>
<p>After placing third in Thursday’s short program, the 19-year-old
scored a world record 227.79 in the free program while skating to the
Succession soundtrack to bring his total to 333.76 — more than 20 points
than the rest of the field.</p>
<p>Malinin dropped to the ice in disbelief after presenting his routine
to a rowdy Bell Centre crowd that cheered and clapped the whole way.</p>
<p>He dethroned two-time defending world champion Shoma Uno of Japan,
who fell to fourth (280.85) after missing two quad jumps to start his
program.</p>
<p>Yuma Kagiyama of Japan won silver (309.65) and Adam Siao Him Fa of
France claimed bronze (284.39). Siao Him Fa climbed from 19th to third
with an awe-inspiring display of his own, which included a backflip.</p>
<p>Earlier Saturday, 2022 Olympic champions Madison Chock and Evan Bates
of the United States defended their ice dance world title with a
season-best total score of 222.20.</p>
<p>Canada’s Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier won silver (219.68) and
Italy’s Charlene Guignard and Marco Fabbri claimed bronze (216.52).</p>
<p>It’s Montreal’s first time hosting the event since 1932. The city was
supposed to stage the 2020 championship but the COVID-19 pandemic shut
down the competition.</p>
<p>Boston will hold the 2025 competition.</p>

<h2 id="biden-trump-win-louisianas-presidential-primary">Biden, Trump
Win Louisiana’s Presidential Primary</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump
won Louisiana’s primary on Saturday, collecting more delegates after
they clinched their party nominations. </p>
<p>Biden also appeared in Missouri’s Democratic primary, with results
not expected to be reported until next week. </p>
<p>None of the races were in suspense. Biden and Trump have beaten their
major competitors. But the primary races are still closely watched by
insiders for turnout and signs of protest voters. </p>
<p>For Biden, some liberals are registering their anger with Israel’s
war against Hamas following the militant group’s October 7 attack. More
than 30,000 people, two-thirds of them women and children, have been
reported killed by Gaza authorities since Israel launched its offensive.
A protest movement launched by Arab American communities in Michigan has
spread to several other states. </p>
<p>Trump is his party’s dominant figure and has locked up a third
straight Republican nomination. But he faces dissent from people worried
about the immense legal jeopardy he faces or critical of his White House
term, which ended shortly after the January 6 insurrection mounted by
his supporters and fueled by his false theories of election fraud. </p>
<p>Saturday’s primary was the Missouri Democratic Party’s first
party-run presidential contest since a new law took effect in August
2022. Louisiana’s primaries, meanwhile, come almost four years after the
