<p>I drive a Tesla Model Y, the best car I've ever owned. I wish Elon
Musk wasn't associated with it. If there were a good alternative to the
Tesla, I would divest in a minute. I could afford to do it and would
welcome the opportunity.</p>

templates</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-07, from: Miek Giebin blog</p>
<p>After dealing with Go templates (also HTML templates) for more than a
year and keep loosing track of where each block {{ends}} I finally did
something about it. But that didn’t work that good. So I’ve switch to
the match-up plugin, which is better than the built-in matchit that I
was using previously. With Neovim I’m using this setup: Plug
'andymass/vim-matchup' And this extra bit of config:
require'nvim-treesitter.configs'.setup { matchup = { enable = true, }, }
This in itself does not make template completion work, for this I just
copied the Hugo template completion (which is just like Go templating)
to the correct place.</p>
