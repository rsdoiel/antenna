## US Officials Push Back After Lawmaker Sounds Alarm on Security Threat

date: 2024-02-15, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The White House along with other top officials are seeking to reassure the American public after a key lawmaker sounded alarms about a "serious national security threat" facing the United States.


In an unusual move that caught some of his fellow lawmakers by surprise, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee publicly called on President Joe Biden to declassify intelligence on the unnamed threat so that the American public and its allies could formulate a response.


Republican Representative Mike Turner declined to elaborate.  But in an email Turner reportedly sent to colleagues, shared on social media by various news outlets, he described the danger as a "foreign military destabilizing capability." 


Several media outlets, quoting U.S. officials, reported late Wednesday that the threat involves a new Russian space-based capability.


But a U.S. official, speaking to VOA on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the intelligence, said that while the danger is significant, it is not imminent.


"The threat described does not involve an active capability that has been deployed," the official said.




The White House also sought to downplay concerns, noting it was already set to brief lawmakers on some of the details Thursday.


"I'm confident that President Biden, in the decisions that he is taking, is going to ensure the security of the American people going forward," said White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan.


"We believe that we can and will and are protecting the national security of the United States," Sullivan told reporters, adding he was surprised that Turner took his concerns public since they were scheduled to meet for a classified briefing Thursday.


Sullivan also defended the decision not to make the threat intelligence public, pointing both to concerns about protecting U.S. "sources and methods," and the president’s willingness to declassify intelligence in the past.


"You definitely are not going to find an unwillingness to do that when it's in our national security interests to do so," he said. "This administration has gone further and, in more creative, more strategic ways, dealt with the declassification of intelligence in the national interest of the United States than any administration in history."


Some key lawmakers also pushed back.


The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Jim Himes, called the threat "a significant one" but "not a cause for panic."


"As to whether more can be declassified about this issue, that is a worthwhile discussion," he added in a statement. "But it is not a discussion to be had in public." 


The leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee likewise sought to allay concerns.


The committee "has the intelligence in question and has been rigorously tracking this issue from the start," Democratic Chairman Mark Warner and Republican Vice Chairman Marco Rubio said in a statement.


"We continue to take this matter seriously and are discussing an appropriate response with the administration," they added. "In the meantime, we must be cautious about potentially disclosing sources and methods that may be key to preserving a range of options for U.S. action."


Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson separately told reporters multiple times there is "no need for public alarm."


"I want to assure the American people," Johnson said. "We just want to assure everyone steady hands are at the wheel. We're working on it and there's no need for alarm."

## Special Counsel Asks Supreme Court to Let Trump's 2020 Election Case Go to Trial

date: 2024-02-15, from: VOA News USA

washington — Special counsel Jack Smith urged the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday to let former President Donald Trump's 2020 election interference case proceed to trial without further delay. 


Prosecutors were responding to a Trump team request from earlier in the week asking for a continued pause in the case as the court considers whether to take up the question of whether the former president is immune from prosecution for official acts in the White House. Two lower courts have overwhelmingly rejected that position, prompting Trump to ask the high court to intervene. 


The case — one of four criminal prosecutions confronting Trump — has reached a critical juncture, with the Supreme Court's next step capable of helping determine whether Trump stands trial this year in Washington or whether the proceedings are going to be postponed by weeks or months of additional arguments. 


The trial date, already postponed once by Trump's immunity appeal, is of paramount importance to both sides. Prosecutors are looking to bring Trump to trial this year while defense lawyers have been seeking delays in his criminal cases. If Trump were to be elected with the case pending, he could presumably use his authority as head of the executive branch to order the Justice Department to dismiss it or could potentially seek to pardon himself. 


Rapid response


Reflecting their desire to proceed quickly, prosecutors responded to Trump's appeal within two days even though the court had given them until next Tuesday. 


Though their filing does not explicitly mention the upcoming November election or Trump's status as the front-runner in the race for the Republican presidential nomination, prosecutors described the case as having "unique national importance" and said that "delay in the resolution of these charges threatens to frustrate the public interest in a speedy and fair verdict." 


"The national interest in resolving those charges without further delay is compelling," they wrote. 


Smith's team charged Trump in August with plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, including by participating in a scheme to disrupt the counting of electoral votes in the run-up to the January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, when his supporters stormed the building in a violent clash with police. 


"The charged crimes strike at the heart of our democracy. A president's alleged criminal scheme to overturn an election and thwart the peaceful transfer of power to his successor should be the last place to recognize a novel form of absolute immunity from federal criminal law," they wrote. 




Trump's lawyers have argued that he is shielded from prosecution for acts that fell within his official duties as president — a legally untested argument since no other former president has been indicted. 


The trial judge and then a federal appeals court rejected those arguments, with a three-judge appeals panel last week saying, "We cannot accept that the office of the Presidency places its former occupants above the law for all time thereafter." 


The proceedings have been effectively frozen by Trump's immunity appeal, with U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan canceling a March 4 trial date while the appeals court considered the matter. No new date has been set. 


Further delays possible


Trump's appeal and request for the Supreme Court to get involved could cause further delays depending on what the justices decide. In December, Smith and his team had urged the justices to take up and decide the immunity issue, even before the appeals court weighed in. But the court declined. 


The Supreme Court's options include rejecting the emergency appeal, which would enable Chutkan to restart the trial proceedings in Washington's federal court. The court also could extend the delay while it hears arguments on the immunity issue. In that event, the schedule the justices set could determine how soon a trial might begin, if indeed they agree with lower-court rulings that Trump is not immune from prosecution. 


On Wednesday, prosecutors urged the court to reject Trump's petition to hear the case, saying that lower-court opinions rejecting immunity for the former president "underscore how remote the possibility is that this Court will agree with his unprecedented legal position." 


But if the court does want to decide the matter, Smith said, the justices should hear arguments in March and issue a final ruling by late June. 


Prosecutors also pushed back against Trump's argument that allowing the case to proceed could chill future presidents' actions for fear they could be criminally charged once they leave office and open the door to politically motivated cases against former commanders-in-chief. 


"That dystopian vision runs contrary to the checks and balances built into our institutions and the framework of the Constitution," they wrote. "Those guardrails ensure that the legal process for determining criminal liability will not be captive to 'political forces,' as applicant forecasts."

## US Sanctions Iran Central Bank Subsidiary, Says It Violated Export Rules

date: 2024-02-14, from: VOA News USA

washington — The U.S. on Wednesday sanctioned three people and four firms — across Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey — for allegedly helping to export goods and technology purchased from U.S. companies to Iran and the nation's central bank. 


The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control said the procurement network transferred U.S. technology for use by Iran's Central Bank in violation of U.S. export restrictions and sanctions. 


Some of the materials acquired by the Central Bank of Iran were items classified as "information security items subject to national security and anti-terrorism controls" by the Commerce Department, Treasury said. 


Included in the sanctions package was Informatics Services Corp., an Iranian subsidiary of Iran's Central Bank that most recently developed the Central Bank Digital Currency platform for the bank; a UAE-based front company, which acquired U.S. tech for the Central Bank of Iran and the front company's CEO; and a Turkey-based affiliate firm that also made purchases that ended up in Iran. 


"The Central Bank of Iran has played a critical role in providing financial support to" Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the militant group Hezbollah, said Treasury Undersecretary Brian E. Nelson, adding that they were the "two key actors intent on further destabilizing the Middle East." 


"The United States will continue to use all available means to disrupt the Iranian regime's illicit attempts to procure sensitive U.S. technology and critical inputs," he said. 


The sanctions block access to U.S. property and bank accounts and prevent the targeted people and companies from doing business with Americans.

## Uncle Sam Is Helping Americans Buy 675 Electric Cars a Day

date: 2024-02-14, from: Heatmap News

The problem is, it hasn’t been updated since 2020. But then today, as if to answer my prayers, I received a taste of the data I was looking for in my inbox. </p><p>A Treasury official shared that the IRS has received notices from car sellers indicating they sold more than 25,000 tax credit-eligible vehicles between January 1 and February 6. That’s an average of more than 675 EVs sold at a government-sponsored discount per day.</p><p>To put that in perspective, about 1.08 million cars were sold in total in the month of January, <a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/news/cox-automotive-forecast-january-2024-u-s-auto-sales-forecast/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to Cox Automotive</a>, or about 34,840 per day. So the tax credit-supported EVs were only about 2% of the total cars sold. </p><p>But 25,000 discounted EVs is nothing to scoff at — especially since starting January 1, two big changes were made to the tax credit that made it both harder and easier for Americans to get them. </p><p>First, new rules that limit what countries the components in eligible EVs are allowed to come from had the effect of disqualifying a lot of EVs from the tax credit. As of today, only 22 models from Chevy, Ford, Rivian, Tesla, and Volkswagen qualify, <a href="https://fueleconomy.gov/feg/tax2023.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Department of Energy</a>. Last year, there were 35 models.</p><p>But at the same time, car buyers were given the option to <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/ev-tax-credit-2024-7500-4000" target="_self">transfer the tax credit to their dealer</a> at the point of sale. That meant the dealer could take the $7,500 discount for new EVs, or $4,000 for used EVs, directly off the price of the car. Buyers no longer have to worry about whether or not they will owe $7,500 in taxes at the end of the year, or wait around for their tax return, to get that money back. </p><p>The Treasury said it has paid approximately $135 million in advance payments to dealers for about 19,000 of the EVs sold this year.</p><p>So even with fewer options available, buyers are still taking advantage of the new instant rebate and finding vehicles that work for them. The vast majority of the EVs sold — more than 22,000 — were new cars, while just over 3,000 were used EVs.</p><p>One disheartening stat included in the data is that some 11,000 dealerships have registered with the IRS to sell tax credit-eligible vehicles. As of last year, there were just over 16,800 dealerships in the country, according to the National Automobile Dealerships Association, so that means only about 65% of dealerships can offer customers the EV tax credit. Many <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2023/11/09/car-dealerships-ev-sales/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dealers are not yet on board</a> with the electric revolution. They take longer to sell and require less maintenance, cutting into profits.</p><p>The Treasury official said the department was trying to increase registrations via trade association partners, webinars, and conferences.</p><p>This smidgeon of data is not enough to assess how well the tax credits are working, and I hope that after tax day, the agency releases similar information about how many people claimed other IRA-related tax credits last year.</p>

## China's Economic Woes May Give US Chance to Pressure North Korea, Some Experts Say

date: 2024-02-14, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Some Asia experts are calling for tough new economic sanctions on China, arguing that the nation's economic downturn makes it particularly vulnerable to pressure to crack down on North Korea's ability to make and launder money for its nuclear weapons and missile programs. 


Other analysts argue the opposite, saying new sanctions now would make Beijing less receptive to U.S. efforts to get it to help curb Pyongyang's weapons programs. 


"Beijing is worried that a long or deep recession would lead to political unrest," and "that worry gives Washington greater leverage over Beijing — leverage that it didn't have during the period of strong Chinese economic growth," said Joshua Stanton, an attorney based in Washington, D.C., who helped draft the Sanctions and Policy Enforcement Act in 2016.  


The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted in a report last month that China's economy will slow from 5.2% GDP growth in 2023 to 4.6% this year, further declining into 4.1% in 2025. 




China's manufacturing activities contracted for the fourth consecutive month in January and the country is further troubled by soaring debt in the property market and local governments. 


In an email to VOA last Friday, Stanton said the Biden administration should "increase pressure on a central government that fears any regional recession" and "designate canneries and sweatshops that employ North Korean labor."  


Chinese factories are known to employ North Korean laborers and label products they manufactured as made in China. Approximately 3,000 North Koreans working illegally in China staged a violent protest in January over unpaid wages, according to Reuters, citing South Korea's intelligence agency.  


In 2017, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution urging countries to repatriate all North Korean workers by December 2019 to curb Pyongyang's ability to make income abroad that supports its weapons programs. North Korean workers remit most of their overseas earnings to the regime. 


Stanton argued that Washington should also "apply enhanced scrutiny to local bank branches in Chinese cities" that launder money for North Korea. "China always promises to cooperate if we don't sanction its banks, but it always breaks those promises," he said. 


China been tightening regulations on its banks that deal with Russia recently in response to strengthened U.S. sanctions on financial institutions that work with the Russian military.




Anthony Ruggiero, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, dismissed the Biden administration's current North Korea sanctions as "weak and ineffective." 


"The administration should target North Korea's revenue generation and Russian and Chinese banks, entities, and individuals aiding Pyongyang's sanctions evasion," he said.  


David Asher, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, said North Korea still works "largely via China" to finance and acquire high-technology products for its military and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs. 


Asher, who oversaw the disruption of North Korea's illegal trading and WMD networks during the George W. Bush administration, said last Saturday via email that there is a "robust" criminal sector in China, "especially Macao and Hong Kong, where North Korean elites continue to launder money including billions of dollars generated via cybercrime." 


But other experts are warning against sanctioning China, especially when its economy is slowing, and the U.S. is trying to get Beijing's help to curb to North Korea's missile launches.  


"You can twist the knob on China and try to enforce more pain in return for its support on North Korea," said Ken Gause, senior adversary analytics specialist at the Center for Naval Analyses, in a telephone interview on Friday. 


"But that will blow up in your face because then, China would see us actively trying to harm China to get it to do something on North Korea."


He continued, "China will not react very well to that, and we could actually make the situation much worse."


He added that "the only way sanctions would work" is when there are "overlapping U.S. and Chinese strategic equities."


Gary Samore, former White House coordinator for arms control and WMD during the Obama administration, agreed during a telephone interview on Monday that the Biden administration may be concerned that sanctioning Chinese entities would make Beijing "less likely to cooperate on diplomatic efforts." 


Samore, who is currently professor of the practice of politics at Brandeis University, added that even if some Chinese entities stopped doing business with North Korea because of sanctions, there could be other Chinese entities that would be willing to work with North Korea.

## Is Geothermal About to Become the Solar of the 2020s?

date: 2024-02-14, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTQ3MDIyOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyNDc2OTk2N30.0YwTL3C1A8GITo5D2OD1KirDUo7nvtHV9yK11rDlpbg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Fervo Energy is getting a lot better at drilling holes. According to data presented this week at Stanford University, it took the company 71 days to drill a geothermal well back in 2022. But last year in Utah, Fervo was able to get drilling down to 21 days, despite those wells being over 2,000 feet deeper. That has reduced drilling time by <a href="https://fervoenergy.com/fervo-energy-drilling-results-show-rapid-advancement-of-geothermal-performance/" target="_blank">70%</a>.</p><p>Fervo is a buzzy, well-funded, and well-connected startup out of Houston that drills wells to produce enhanced geothermal energy, a clean source of power derived from heat beneath the Earth’s surface. But whereas traditional geothermal means tapping into hot water or steam underground, Fervo drills as deep as 9,000 feet down to access hot rocks, which are far more ubiquitous, and then pumps water into them, potentially unlocking many more areas for this kind of power generation. </p><p><span></span>This week’s announcement follows a pilot project last year where the company <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-18/fervo-energy-says-it-has-achieved-geothermal-energy-tech-breakthrough" target="_blank">was actually able to produce electricity</a>. Now the challenge is producing that electricity at scale — and that requires drilling faster.</p><p>Already its new timeline is translating in dramatic cost reductions, the company says, from $9.4 million to $4.8 million per well. For its Utah site, where it might need to drill <a href="https://www.blm.gov/press-release/blm-announces-decision-fervo-energy-cape-modern-geothermal-exploration-project" target="_blank">29 wells</a>, back-of-the-envelope math suggests that could translate into up to $130 million in savings. </p><p> “The biggest expense in drilling is time it takes to drill. The easiest way to reduce drilling costs is to drill faster,” Fervo’s co-founder and chief executive Tim Latimer told me. <strong></strong></p><p>Latimer’s big idea behind Fervo is not just a conceptual one about how to generate geothermal power in areas that don’t produce steam or very hot water on their own, but also about how to apply the steady improvement and cost reductions seen in the oil and gas industry to non-carbon emitting power generation that can be available 24 hours a day.</p><p>“Oil and gas drilling has become incredibly much more efficient. That’s what drove the shale revolution. We were excited about 45-day wells and now you’ll see fields where people drill wells in 10 days or less,” Latimer told me.</p><p>Some of the improvement Fervo has achieved is due to porting over specific pieces of technology from the shale industry, like polycrystalline diamond compact drillbits and using them on the harder granite that Fervo drills. “Taking something that unlocked the shale revolution and making it work for hard rock was our whole thesis,” Latimer said. And there’s just been the steady improvements that come through experience and automation. Latimer described how they figured out a standardized, automated way to pick up and set down the drill bit so that the bit isn’t damaged when drilling starts up again.</p><p>“When we think about Fervo, a lot of the things we think about is not [how to] narrowly cut costs for one well, but ‘how do we create a system where you simplify well design and make its more standardized.’”</p><p>The idea is that there can be a “learning curve” with drilling geothermal wells, dropping costs over time. “We think geothermal will be on the end of that spectrum like solar or LEDs or battery that benefits from a learning curve because we figured out a way to standardize,” Latimer said. “Fervo is a learning curve company.”</p><p>These<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421517301027" target="_blank"> learning curves</a> haven’t just<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/column-kemp-fracking-costs-idUSL5E8NB83Q20121211/" target="_blank"> been seen in fracking</a>, but famously in green energy as well,  especially standardized technology like <a href="https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(22)00410-X" target="_blank">solar panels</a>, whose costs reductions consistently outpace expert forecasts. On the flip side, other forms of emission-free power, <a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-are-nuclear-power-construction" target="_blank">namely nuclear power</a>, seem to be<a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-are-nuclear-power-construction" target="_blank"> getting more expensive over time</a>.</p><p>Fervo has also been capturing attention — and dollars — across the green energy community because of a specific type of power that enhanced geothermal could provide: 24 hour generation.</p><p>Other forms of non-carbon-emitting energy, particularly solar and wind, only generate power either at specific times or day (when it’s sunny) or when the weather is a certain way (windy). With enough transmission and batteries, these types of intermittent generation could power substantially more of the grid than they do today, but they can’t do it all —<a href="https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(18)30386-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2542435118303866%3Fshowall%3Dtrue#secsectitle0020" target="_blank"> at least while keeping costs under control</a>.</p><p>The need for 24/7 clean power has only been amplified by the<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/hydrogen-rule-biden-clean-energy" target="_self"> Treasury Department’s proposed rules on green hydrogen</a>, which would make hydrogen producers prove they’re using non-carbon-emitting energy for their operations in order to qualify for subsidies.</p><p>Latimer said Fervo’s inbox “blew up” after the proposed rules went out. “We’re every hydrogen tech’s favorite supplier now,” he said. But he noted that Fervo’s appeal was by no means limited to green hydrogen.</p><p>“Round-the-clock reliable electricity that doesn’t come with carbon emissions is not a hard sell, it just has to be a cost structure that makes sense.”</p><p>Fervo’s work is especially attractive to technology companies, who have long been pioneers in procuring green energy and are now interested in being able to get it 24/7. Fervo’s Nevada projects are contracted to provide <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/google-fervo-geothermal-project-creates-carbon-free-energy" target="_blank">power to Google’s data centers</a> and other infrastructure throughout the state.</p><p>While Latimer would not say what Fervo’s current costs are, he did say that for it to be competitive, it would have to get down to around $100 per megawatt-hour, about where traditional geothermal — where <a href="https://www.calpine.com/operations/power-operations/technologies/geothermal" target="_blank">steam or very hot water</a> that’s already present underground is brought to the surface —  is now.<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-launches-new-energy-earthshot-slash-cost-geothermal-power" target="_blank"> The Department of Energy’s goal is</a> to reduce enhanced geothermal costs by around 90 percent to $45 per megawatt hour by 2025. “The results show we’re on the path to already being able to provide economic projects even at that market rate,” Latimer said.</p><p>And Fervo is continuing to get attention — and dollars — from the federal government. The Department of Energy announced Tuesday that Fervo was one of three companies — the other two being Chevron and Mazama — that would <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-invests-60-million-expand-clean-renewable-geothermal-energy#:~:text=Fervo%20Energy%E2%80%94This%20pilot%20within,existing%20commercial%20geothermal%20power%20production." target="_blank">receive grants </a>for their geothermal work.</p>

## Democrats, Republicans Hold Black History Month Events With Eye on November Election

date: 2024-02-14, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON  — Black History Month, often a time to recognize the contributions of African Americans in U.S. history, was marked in the nation's capital this week with a focus on present divides and the November election when Black turnout will be integral to the outcome.


At the White House, the Biden administration on Tuesday hosted more than two dozen family members of civil rights icons and major historical figures for a gala celebrating Black history. Vice President Kamala Harris made a surprise appearance where she praised the families and recounted the administration's commitment to Black communities.


A few hours later, Republicans held a reception in Washington's U Street neighborhood, a key part of Black history in the city, to celebrate former GOP (Republican) officials and activists who have engaged Black voters.


The White House has taken Black History Month as an opportunity to highlight the administration's efforts on priorities such as education, voting rights and jobs. Republicans see a chance to win more votes from a core Democratic constituency, noting President Joe Biden's lower popularity with Black adults and the criticism he has taken for inflation and his handling of the border.




Biden's approval rating among Black adults was 42% in a January poll by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, a substantial drop from the first year of his presidency.


Democrats are spotlighting Biden's support with civil rights stalwarts and lambasting Republicans for enacting policies restricting how educators discuss race and history in the classroom.


"We know that those who don't remember their history are doomed to repeat it," said Democratic Rep. Terri Sewell, to the families assembled at the White House. Sewell represents Selma, Alabama, where white police beat Black civil rights marchers in 1965 on a day remembered today as "Bloody Sunday."


"At a time when extremists seek to erase our history and roll back our progress, we should take a lesson from our foremothers and forefathers," she said.


Republicans held their own Black History Month celebration later that evening with about 100 people.


"As RNC Chair, I have made it a mission to reach out to communities and voters that we have ignored as a party," said Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel during Tuesday night's event. "Black voters are going to make history this November because they're going to vote Republican at the highest level we've ever seen," McDaniel predicted to applause from the audience.




The RNC intends to expand its number of community outreach centers in Black communities after the GOP primary concludes. The party has been optimistic about its chances to improve its poor margins with Black voters since Republicans made slight inroads with them in the 2022 midterm elections.


But the party's current focus on issues like the teaching of race and history may risk mobilizing Black voters against the GOP. Republican officials in at least a dozen states have enacted policies that regulate how educators discuss topics including race, history and gender in the classroom.


"This moment in time is evidence that our history is unbannable, that teaching it is core to our progress, and that Black history is American history," Nevada Rep. Steve Horsford, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, told the White House crowd.


The Biden campaign dismissed GOP Black voter outreach as insincere and noted that former President Donald Trump, the current front-runner for the GOP nomination, had dinner in 2022 with Nick Fuentes, a Holocaust-denying white nationalist.


"In Donald Trump's Republican Party, celebrating Black History Month means teaching kids that slavery benefited Black people, papering over slavery as the cause of the Civil War and sharing well-done steaks doused in ketchup with white supremacists at Mar-a-Lago," said Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler. "I'm sure they'll serve up plenty of the same at their little event."


The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.


On Tuesday, the Biden campaign rolled out new ads targeting Black voters by highlighting the administration's investments in historically Black colleges and universities as well as the number of Black officeholders appointed by Biden, including Harris, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. And the Democratic National Committee on Wednesday unveiled digital ads targeting HBCUs in battleground states that touts Biden's record on student debt.


Democrats point to record-low Black unemployment, policies capping the cost of insulin and Biden's cancellation of about $137 billion in student loan debt as policies they hope will boost support among Black voters. And party officials and strategists stress that its emphasis on Black voters extends beyond a single month of events.


Biden also moved to increase Black political power when he upended precedent to place South Carolina and its substantial Black population first in the party's primary calendar. South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, a veteran of the Civil Rights movement and a close Biden ally, co-chairs the president's reelection campaign.


According to some of the assembled Republican activists on Tuesday night, many of whom are Black, the GOP simply lacked the sustained efforts needed to court more Black voters. Quenton Jordan, a Republican activist who won an award at the event, said that the GOP is now "putting forth an effort to capture the Black vote where in previous years, that just wasn't the case."


"I remember when we had a greater pool," said Ken Blackwell, a former Ohio Republican secretary of state who received an award at the reception. "That's why this is important. To reengage, to give our narrative and give them a choice. But first, we've got to show up."

kansas city, missouri — Eight children were among 22 people hit by gunfire in a shooting at the end of Wednesday's parade to celebrate the Kansas City Chiefs' Super Bowl win, authorities said. One person was killed, identified by her radio station as a DJ. 


Kansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves detailed the shooting's toll at a news conference and said three people had been taken into custody. 


"I'm angry at what happened today. The people who came to this celebration should expect a safe environment," Graves said. Police did not immediately release details about the people taken into custody or about a possible motive for the shootings. She said firearms had been recovered, but not what kind of weapons were used. 


"There's a lot of work ahead. This is just the beginning stages," she said. "All of that is being actively investigated." 


It was the latest sports celebration in the U.S. to be marred by gun violence. A shooting injured several people last year in downtown Denver after the Nuggets' NBA championship, and gunfire erupted last year at a parking lot near the Texas Rangers' World Series championship parade. 


Radio station KKFI said in a Facebook post Wednesday evening that DJ Lisa Lopez, host of "Taste of Tejano," was killed in the shooting. 


"This senseless act has taken a beautiful person from her family and this KC community," KKFI said in a statement. 


The shooting outside Union Station happened despite more than 800 police officers who were in the building and around the area, including on top of nearby buildings, said Mayor Quinton Lucas, who attended with his wife and mother and had to run for cover when gunfire broke out. 


"I think that's something that all of us who are parents, who are just regular people living each day, have to decide what we wish to do about," Lucas said. "Parades, rallies, schools, movies. It seems like almost nothing is safe." 


Kansas City has long struggled with gun violence, and in 2020 it was among nine cities targeted by the U.S. Justice Department in an effort to crack down on violent crime. In 2023 the city matched a record with 182 homicides, most of which involved guns. 


Lucas has joined with mayors across the country in calling for new laws to reduce gun violence, including mandating universal background checks. 


Lisa Money, a resident of the city, was trying to gather some confetti near the end of the parade when she heard somebody yell, "Down, down, everybody down!" 


At first Money thought somebody might be joking. Then she saw a SWAT team jumping over a nearby fence. 


"I can't believe it really happened. Who in their right mind would do something like this? This is supposed to be a day of celebration for everybody in the city and the surrounding area," she said. 


Kevin Sanders, 53, of Lenexa, Kansas, said he heard what sounded like firecrackers and then people started running. After that initial flurry, calm returned, and he didn't think much of it. But 10 minutes later, ambulances started showing up. 


University Health spokeswoman Nancy Lewis said the hospital was treating eight gunshot victims. Two were in critical condition and six were in stable condition, she said. The hospital also was treating four people for other injuries resulting from the chaos after the shooting, Lewis said. 


Lisa Augustine, spokesperson for Children's Mercy Kansas City, said the hospital was treating 12 patients from the rally, including 11 children, some of whom suffered gunshot wounds. 


St. Luke's Hospital of Kansas City received one gunshot patient in critical condition and three walk-ins with injuries that were not life-threatening, spokesperson Laurel Gifford said. 




Chiefs trainer Rick Burkholder said that he was with coach Andy Reid and other coaches and staff members at the time of the shooting, and that the team was on buses and returning to Arrowhead Stadium. 


"We are truly saddened by the senseless act of violence that occurred outside of Union Station at the conclusion of today's parade and rally," the team said in a statement. 


Missouri's Republican Governor Mike Parson and first lady Teresa Parson were at the parade during the gunfire but were unhurt. 


President Joe Biden was briefed on the shooting and will continue to receive updates, a White House spokesperson said. White House officials were in touch with state and local leaders, and federal law enforcement was on the scene supporting local counterparts.

## Key US Lawmaker Warns of 'Serious National Security Threat'

date: 2024-02-14, from: VOA News USA

Washington  — A top U.S. lawmaker is sounding an alarm about a potentially significant threat to the country's security, publicly calling on President Joe Biden to declassify intelligence so that the American public and its allies can formulate a response. 


The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Republican Representative Mike Turner, issued a statement Tuesday warning of a "serious national security threat." 


Turner's statement did not elaborate on the threat, but noted he has requested that the president share the information more quickly and more widely. 


A copy of an email Turner reportedly sent to colleagues, shared on social media by various news outlets, described the danger as a "foreign military destabilizing capability."  


Still, the White House on Wednesday sought to downplay Turner's concerns. 




"I'm confident that President Biden, in the decisions that he is taking, is going to ensure the security of the American people going forward," said White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. 


"We believe that we can and will and are protecting the national security of the United States," Sullivan told reporters, adding he was surprised that Turner took his concerns public since they were scheduled to meet for a classified briefing Thursday. 


Sullivan also defended the decision not to make the threat intelligence public, pointing both to concerns about protecting U.S. "sources and methods," and the president's willingness to declassify intelligence in the past. 


"You definitely are not going to find an unwillingness to do that when it's in our national security interests to do so," he said. "This administration has gone further and, in more creative, more strategic ways, dealt with the declassification of intelligence in the national interest of the United States than any administration in history." 


Some key lawmakers also pushed back. 


The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Jim Himes, called the threat "a significant one" but "not a cause for panic."




"As to whether more can be declassified about this issue, that is a worthwhile discussion," he added. "But it is not a discussion to be had in public." 


The leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee likewise sought to allay concerns.


The committee "has the intelligence in question and has been rigorously tracking this issue from the start," Democratic Chairman Mark Warner and Republican Vice Chairman Marco Rubio said in a statement.


"We continue to take this matter seriously and are discussing an appropriate response with the administration," they added. "In the meantime, we must be cautious about potentially disclosing sources and methods that may be key to preserving a range of options for U.S. action."


Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson separately told reporters multiple times there is "no need for public alarm."


"I want to assure the American people," Johnson said. "We just want to assure everyone steady hands are at the wheel. We're working on it and there's no need for alarm." 


VOA's Katherine Gypson conributed to this report.

But it&#8217;s not an app for testing your eyesight, at least not unless you consider watching pirated movies on your smartphone [&#8230;]

## E-quipment highlight: Bobcat E10e excavates under St. Jerome’s in Naples

date: 2024-02-14, from: Electrek Feed

In this case, we’re not talking about financial cost, but <em>cultural</em> cost – in this case, at the St. Jerome Monumental Complex in Naples, where Bobcat is putting its E10e electric mini excavator to work exploring the historic landmark.</p>

## Has Offshore Wind Finally Hit Rock Bottom?

	Maybe it’s actually about to turn a corner. In this episode, Jesse Jenkins, an energy systems expert and professor at Princeton University, and I discuss the future of the sector, and Jesse tries to convince me that the industry is about to bounce back.

	Here's an excerpt of our conversation:
</p><blockquote>
<strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>Make a case to me about why offshore wind … like 2023 was the catastrophic year for offshore wind, and now it’s going to come back.<br/>
<strong><br/>
	Jesse Jenkins:</strong> Yeah, that’s a great question. <br/>
<br/>
	I mean, I think it is worth pausing and noting that offshore wind in the United States was already pretty expensive, and is now even more expensive. So I think the contracts that New Jersey signed, for example, which are 20-year, basically fixed price contracts — they got to go up at 2% per year, which is what we thought inflation would be, but now is maybe not where it will be over the next few years, but basically fixed long term contracts — were in the $80 to $90 per megawatt-hour range, which itself is roughly double the wholesale electricity cost in the region. So we’re basically paying for twice as much for wind energy as we would pay for natural gas or coal fired power in the regional electricity mix. And that’s after a federal subsidy knocks off 30% of the upfront cost.<br/>
<br/>
	That sounds like a lot, right? And I think it’s fair to say that the costs that are going to be signed in the new auctions that are happening now are going to be up or above $100 per megawatt hour. So, just the interest rates alone ... You know, the Fed raised interest rates by over 5% from March 2022 to August 2023. That 5 percentage point increase in the cost of capital would raise the levelized cost, or average cost of electricity alone, by about a third for any of these projects. So it’s a huge cost escalator. And of course, the underlying cost of building the projects went up by about 65%. That’s way faster, about three times faster than consumer goods went up. We all know about how much more expensive it is to buy milk or bread or fill up at the gas pump. So, that’s the case for seeing this as, you know, the bear case — that these projects are now really expensive, and maybe they’re more expensive than we’re willing to pay.<br/>
<br/>
	On the other hand, I think there’s three reasons that, basically every state is still committed to building out offshore wind despite those cost increases. One is that is an historic, once in a generation macro inflationary cycle, a global pandemic with all of the supply chain disruptions that came with that, followed by a war in Europe and all of the impacts on energy costs that that brought about, you know, etc., these are really unique circumstances. And so those should be behind us, right? <br/>
<br/>
	Hopefully we can then get back on a trajectory of building out this new industry across the region, including the supply chains and the expertise in the transmission infrastructure undersea, to bring the wind onshore. That will steadily drive down the cost. And the reason to be optimistic about that is we have seen that in Europe, right? The wind industry did follow a very significant cost decline trajectory over the 15 years or so from its birth to now, in Europe. And we’re just going to have to pay a lot of those costs here because that learning and the experience in the infrastructure and the workforce isn’t really translatable.<br/>
<br/>
	The second reason is just there’s not a lot of alternatives for these states. Yes, electricity is structurally more expensive in Europe. It’s also structurally more expensive all along the eastern coast because we have high population density, population centers. There’s … these are very dense populated centers close to the coast, without access to the really good wind and solar resources that we see in the U.S. interior or the West. And so what are we going to do? Are we going to continue to burn fossil fuels? That would be the cheapest thing to do in the near term, but of course has lots of long term implications, including accelerating climate change. And all of these states have committed to transitioning away from fossil fuels. Virginia, New Jersey, York, Massachusetts, etc. have these 100% clean energy commitments.

My co-host, Jenkins: will join us in a second and we’ll get on with the show. But first, a word from our sponsor.</p><p>[AD BREAK]</p><p><strong>Meyer:</strong> Hello, my name is Robinson Meyer. I’m the founding executive editor of Heatmap News.</p><p><strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>And I’m Jesse Jenkins, a professor at Princeton University and an expert in energy systems and climate policy.</p><p><strong>Meyer: </strong>And you are listening to Shift Key, a new podcast about climate change and the shift away from fossil fuels, from Heatmap News. On today’s episode, we’re going to talk about what exactly is happening in the offshore wind industry. Is it hurt? Is it dying? Is it —has</p><p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> Has it hit rock bottom?</p><p><strong>Meyer: </strong>Has it hit rock bottom? Is it very depressed? What’s happening? And of course, we’ll share our upshifts and downshifts from the week, and I will get better at pronouncing it.</p><p>Let’s get into it. Jesse, last year was, I think it’s fair to say, a pretty catastrophic year for offshore wind, especially in the United States. That was capped last week when Orsted, which is the world’s largest offshore wind developer, announced that it was cutting 800 jobs, a little less than 10% of its workforce, and suspending its dividend — it’s not going to pay anything to investors — and it was also exiting from a number of European markets, including Norway, Portugal and Spain. And not only that, but it has cut down its kind of internal target for how much offshore wind it wants to build by 2030. It had once hoped to build 50 gigawatts. Now it’s going to go closer to 35 to 38. And what’s interesting is that Orsted, you know, not profitable last year. But that was like, entirely driven by the U.S. So it would have made $2 billion in profit last year, but it took $5 billion in impairment charges — like it would have been profitable, except for its U.S. business. And its U.S. business took it as a firm from like $2 billion in the black to $3 billion in the red.</p><p>So, Jesse, let’s just start with, I think, getting listeners up to speed. What projects did Orsted cancel in the United States last year?</p><p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> Yes. So they actually canceled several, most recently, a pair of projects that had sold contracts to Maryland. That followed a pair of projects in New Jersey, and another that would serve New York State. So I think it’s five projects in total and a couple phases of the same project in New Jersey. And those projects all were under long term contracts with state entities. And we’ll talk a lot more about the role of the states in driving the offshore wind industry here in the Atlantic states, but they basically sign long term, you know, purchase agreements with the states to buy power at a fixed price with, you know, a set escalation schedule. And they did that many years ago or, you know, before the pandemic, before the significant surge in inflation, the cost of goods that rose over the last few years — and then, just as importantly, before the increase in interest rates that the Federal Reserve used to try to combat that inflation.</p><p>And so you combine those two things, and it’s really a double whammy. The cost of cement and steel and concrete and labor and all of the specialty equipment they need to build these offshore wind projects is skyrocketing at the exact same time that the finance costs, the mortgage they have to take out to build these projects, is going up. And all that meant that they couldn’t honor their contracts and that, you know, it’s notable that they pulled out because in each of these cases, they had to incur several hundred million dollars of penalties for voiding the contracts with the state. So it’s not just the money they sunk into the projects that may not be complete, but it’s also very significant financial penalties for walking away.</p><p><strong>Meyer: </strong>And how did they explain why they needed to … What did they blame?</p><p><strong>Jenkins: </strong>I think it’s three issues that they have consistently pointed to. We talked about two already. One is the cost of goods and labor, going up with inflation. The second is interest rates, which have a huge impact on these projects. They’re almost all upfront cost, right, with some operation and maintenance over time, but no fuel costs. So once you get these wind farms up and running, they’re more or less free. But you got to take out a big mortgage, right? Just like you do when you buy a house. And you got to pay that back over time. And so the interest rate that you strike for those financing costs is a big determinant of how much you can afford to sell your power at and still make a profit.</p><p>And then the third factor is a peculiar one, which is the absence of very specialized ships that are used to install these giant wind turbines. And they really don’t exist in the U.S. because we’re just starting to build our industry here. The industry in Europe that has been, you know, going for several decades in the North Sea has a number of these vessels, you know, they’re in use there. We could bring them here, but we have this law called the Jones Act, which requires any vessel that is leaving a U.S. port for another U.S. destination to be a U.S. built and U.S. crewed ship, and we just don’t have any of those yet. There’s one coming soon. But that is a real challenge logistically for any of these projects.</p><p><strong>Meyer: </strong>And let’s just, I think, as a final point, before we go into the discussion further, why is offshore wind, like, important at all? Why, as people who want to solve climate change, should we care at all about how specific offshore wind projects off the coast of New Jersey or Maryland or Rhode Island are going?</p><p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> Yeah, I think for I mean, a couple reasons. One is that this is a big new industry that we’re trying to kind of give birth to in the region. These were some of the first large scale wind farms. Every 3,000 megawatts of wind power out there is roughly enough to supply the annual electricity needs of about a million households. So that’s a big sized city just in New York State alone, projects that were canceled by Orsted and Equinor totaled about 3 GW. So that’s enough energy for like, Queens, you know, one of the entire boroughs, right? So these are big deals in terms of the amount of supply they’re going to provide and the the local economic impact.</p><p>And so I think for the region at least — I mean, if you’re in Wyoming, you probably don’t care too much about what’s going on in the Atlantic. But all up and down the East Coast from North Carolina to Maine, states have made a real significant commitment to offshore wind, to be a major contributor to their local electricity mix and help them meet clean energy and climate goals. And, you know, and their megaprojects are big, you know, large-scale efforts, billion-dollar projects, you know, millions of households worth of energy and lots of jobs and local economic investment. And so when a project like that fails, you know, it’s kind of a big deal for the local economy, for the politics around it, for our progress towards our clean energy goals. And it’s a potential setback in our clean energy transition.</p><p><strong>Meyer:</strong> There’s also — It’s economically important, but there’s also technical, I think what an electricity engineer would call resource related reasons why we want offshore wind. Is this right? Like it fits into the grid in a very useful way. Am I wrong about this?</p><p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> Yeah, actually, I was just teaching a lecture on wind power to my students today, and we took a look at the Global Wind Atlas, which we can drop in the show notes. And what you can really see quite clearly is that the onshore wind potential in the Atlantic area is really quite poor. We don’t really have good locations to build wind power in Virginia or New York, near the coast at least, or in New Jersey at all. But the wind resource offshore is very good. </p><p>Wind speeds, you know, can move across the ocean. It’s very flat. There’s nothing that gets in the way. And you get a lot of frequent, wind patterns driven by the difference in temperature between the ocean and the land. So there’s all these localized effects that tend to produce a lot of energy in the morning, in the evening and overnight when it’s cooling off. And these are nice complements to solar power that produces mostly during the day. And you know, you can’t run your entire grid on one variable renewable resource, or even two. But having offshore wind complementary, you know, which is complementary to solar, and also to sometimes onshore wind patterns further inland that, you know, are separated from the ocean can really help you smooth out the variability that you have to deal with, make it easier for energy storage and, and flexible demand and more dispatchable generators to kind of fill in the gaps around it.<br/></p><p>And there’s just really not a lot of other options in these states. Like, you know, if you want to have economic development and meet your clean energy goals with resources in your state, there’s just not a lot of other options. You can, you know, build solar, you can build nuclear power plants, or you can do offshore wind. Those are kind of your options for the Atlantic states, at least those without, you know, the large interior territories that New York has.</p><p><strong>Meyer:</strong> So I want to come back to some of the like resource questions in a second. I will say, this is all very interesting — well, let me think about how I want to pitch this. I understand offshore wind being technically important, right? I understand how it fits into the solar mix. I understand it’s good economic development.</p><p>I found last year to be fairly … I wouldn’t say radicalizing, but I will say I kind of came out of last year being like, I don’t know if I see it anymore. Like I did start to feel like, man, is offshore wind more of a like, is it going to succeed exclusively in Europe and China, where there is more willingness to have a working coast, where electricity, especially in Europe, is just structurally more expensive? And so this technique, this way of generating electricity, kind of fits into their mix better. And so, what I’m going to ask you to do is just argue to me, like make a case for why that’s wrong. Make a case to me about why offshore wind … like 2023 was the catastrophic year for offshore wind, and now it’s going to come back.</p><p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> Yeah, that’s a great question. I mean, I think it is worth pausing and noting that offshore wind in the United States was already pretty expensive, and is now even more expensive. So I think the contracts that New Jersey signed, for example, which are 20-year, you know, basically fixed price contracts — they got to go up at 2% per year, which is, you know, what we thought inflation would be, but now is maybe not where it will be over the next few years, but basically fixed long term contracts — were in the $80 to $90 per megawatt-hour range, which itself is roughly double the wholesale electricity cost in the region. So we’re, you know, we’re basically paying for, you know, twice as much for wind energy as we would pay for natural gas or coal fired power in the regional electricity mix. And that’s after a federal subsidy knocks off 30% of the upfront cost.</p><p>That sounds like a lot, right? And I think it’s fair to say that the costs that are going to be signed in the new auctions that are happening now are going to be up or above $100 per megawatt hour. So, you know, they, you know, just the interest rates alone. You know, the Fed raised interest rates by over 5% from March 2022 to August 2023. That 5 percentage point increase in the cost of capital would raise the levelized cost, or average cost of electricity alone, by about a third for any of these projects. So it’s a huge cost escalator. And of course, the underlying cost of building the projects went up by about 65%. That’s way faster, about three times faster than consumer goods went up. So, you know, we all know about how much more expensive it is to buy milk or bread or fill up at the gas pump. So, you know, that’s the case for seeing this as, you know, the bear case — that these projects are now really expensive, and maybe they’re more expensive than we’re willing to pay.</p><p>On the other hand, I think there’s three reasons that, basically every state is still committed to building out offshore wind despite those cost increases. One is that is a, you know, a historic, once in a generation macro inflationary cycle, a global pandemic with all of the supply chain disruptions that came with that, followed by a war in Europe and all of the impacts on energy costs that that, you know, brought about, you know, etc., these are really unique circumstances. You know, and so those should be behind us, right? Hopefully we can then get back on a trajectory of building out this new industry across the region, including the supply chains and the expertise in the transmission infrastructure undersea, to bring the wind onshore. That will steadily drive down the cost. And the reason to be optimistic about that is we have seen that in Europe, right? The wind industry did follow a very significant cost decline trajectory over the, you know, 15 years or so from its birth to now, in Europe. And we’re just going to have to pay a lot of those costs here because that learning and the experience in the infrastructure and the workforce isn’t really translatable.</p><p>The second reason is just there’s not a lot of alternatives for these states. You know, yes, electricity is structurally more expensive in Europe. It’s also structurally more expensive all along the eastern coast because we have high population density, population centers. There’s … these are very dense populated centers close to the coast, without access to the really good wind and solar resources that we see in the U.S. interior or the West. And so what are we going to do? Are we going to continue to burn fossil fuels? That would be the cheapest thing to do in the near term, but of course has lots of long term implications, including accelerating climate change. And all of these states have committed to transitioning away from fossil fuels. Virginia, New Jersey, York, Massachusetts, etc. have these 100% clean energy commitments.</p><p><strong>Meyer: </strong>Assuming those states have this durable interest in decarbonization, in some ways, like, offshore wind has to have hit rock bottom, is part of what I’m hearing. Because there are just no other options. So they could go through this tear-your-hair out frustration loop, where they go try to build more solar, and then they go try to build more nuclear, and maybe those don’t work, so then they find themselves back where they began with offshore wind. But like, even with that, they’re still going to need offshore wind. So can you just get us up to speed on, like, what’s the good news in offshore wind, I guess?</p><p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> Yeah. And I think this is the evidence that the states are going to stay committed and are moving forward, and that we probably have hit rock bottom. So, you know, yes, the news in November and December and early January was dominated by all these cancellations. And it wasn’t just Orsted. There were others up and down the Atlantic coast. But if we look at just, you know, New York and New Jersey, there’s similar stories in other states. You know, New York State has a goal of building 9,000 MW or 9 GW of offshore wind by 2035. Again, that’s about enough, to power 3 million households. So they had a third-round contract towards the end of last year. At that point, they had contracted for about 8.3 of those 9 GW, so they were kind of almost there. Then we had these cancellations: Orsted’s, Sunrise Wind and Equinor’s Empire I and II that lost about 3 GW of that. So now they’re back to about 5 GW of the nine. New York just closed another accelerated auction. And if that, you know, contracts another roughly 3 or 4 GW, like the last round, that would get them their full pipeline of nine gigawatts of projects. And again, they have until 2035 to bring those online. So it’s sort of like, you know, three steps forward, two steps back in the near term here, but they’re continuing to move forward. We could still hit those goals.</p><p>What’s going to happen is that the buildout trajectory is going to get pushed back by a couple of years, and even some of those canceled projects could have a second lease on life because they are going to be rebid into these subsequent auctions. And we think we saw that, actually, with Orsted re-bidding one of their projects into New York’s recent auction in January, and we don’t know if they’ll win that round of auction. They have to beat out other competitive bids from other developers. That’s good. They tried to get New York to just single, to bilaterally renegotiate their existing contract and give them more money. And New York and New Jersey, you know, basically, and Massachusetts, all said no to those requests from developers. They said, look, a contract’s not worth anything if we sign it and you agree to a price and then you come back later and ask for more money. So if you want more money, you’re going to have to go out and, you know, pay the fine for not honor your contract and then rebid, and, and beat out everybody else. And if you can’t beat everybody else, that’s not in the interest of the state. So they really held the line against all of the requests from the developers to try to, you know, inflate their contracts. But some of those projects will come back in this next round. We’ll just come back at a higher price and probably a couple of years delayed.</p><p><strong>Meyer:</strong> Let’s zoom out for a second. So we’ve been talking about the Atlantic a lot, partially I think, because you and I, listeners will discover, have a shared interest in New Jersey.</p><p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> That’s right.</p><p><strong>Meyer: </strong>Me, having grown up in New Jersey and you currently living in New Jersey. Let’s zoom out from New Jersey for a second. Much of the Atlantic coast is not a working shoreline in, I think, ways that parts of, say, Northern Europe are a working shoreline. But we do have working shoreline in the country. And that’s not to say that like people on the coast don’t work. It’s just like.</p><p><strong>Jenkins: </strong>It’s a lot of tourism.</p><p><strong>Meyer: </strong>It’s a lot of tourism. It’s a very tourism dependent industry. And so anything like these wind farms, they’re going to be close enough to be seen from the shore. They were not going to be very big, but they were going to be close enough to be seen from the shore. And you really, when you’re there, you don’t see a lot of other light industrial activities from the shore. We do have a working coastline in the U.S., though. It’s the Gulf Coast. And so why are we not like filling the Gulf Coast with offshore wind farms?</p><p><strong>Jenkins: </strong>There’s really two main reasons why that didn’t happen. One is physics and the second is politics — I think we’ll keep coming back to those two as consistent themes in the show, physics and politics. But the first is just that, unlike the Jersey Shore or New York, you know, coastline or Virginia, where we really don’t have good wind resources onshore, Texas has an incredible wind resource onshore, including even the coastal regions quite close to the shoreline. And also the Gulf Coast, wind speeds are not as high, although it does suffer hurricanes. The average wind speeds are not as consistently high as they are in the Atlantic because it is a gulf. It’s, you know, it’s not a big open expanse of ocean the way the Atlantic is. And so the dominant wind patterns are not quite so strong. So the differential, the sort of benefit that you get from going offshore is really quite modest, if anything, in the Gulf versus a good onshore wind site. And of course, anytime you’re building in a marine environment where you have to deal with the corrosive nature of the ocean and the damaging destruction of storms and the cost of servicing and equipping, and, you know, working on wind farms and deep offshore, that’s going to be a lot more expensive. So unless you’re getting a lot more energy out of that project than you would on land, it just simply doesn’t make sense to build offshore. So that’s the kind of physics and economics.</p><p>Of course, the second reason — we talked already about the commitment to decarbonization that all of those states in the Atlantic exhibit, which is really driving the ship, so to speak. Texas, clearly, Mississippi, Louisiana, they clearly don’t have the same kind of commitment, at least at this point, to those goals. And we should say that’s really important because the Inflation Reduction Act provides significant long term tax credits for offshore wind and solar and, you know, onshore wind and all kinds of other clean electricity sources. And while those tax credits have been enough to make solar and wind onshore quite economically attractive in deep red states, right — you know, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, all over the place are building huge amounts of onshore wind and solar just based on the economics, not because of their climate or green credentials — that’s just not true for offshore wind. The tax credits alone, again, they still leave offshore wind about twice the cost of wholesale energy. And so they’re just not going to move forward without a state level commitment. And that’s really lacking in the Gulf Coast region as well.</p><p><strong>Meyer:</strong> That’s really interesting.</p><p>[AD BREAK]</p><p>So I want to ask — there’s like a point that keeps coming up again and again here that is, like, the states play a major role. And I do think this is interesting. From a larger policy like to kind of zoom out a bit and kind of look at this as a policy question. Normally when we think about states playing a role in climate policy, there’s like one jewel, there’s like one big star when we talk about state level climate policy, and that’s California. And that’s because California, and this is not where, I’m not talking about the electricity system here. I’m talking about kind of the whole emissions picture. California has a special carve out under the law, under the Clean Air Act — like it’s written into the text that Congress passed, that California can set higher standards for certain pollutants than the rest of the country, and that any other state can join into its standards. And California does do that for a number of pollutants, including right now for carbon dioxide. I think right now about 13, 12 or 13 states sign on to its standards.</p><p>But other than that, other than California having these special powers to, like, regulate the vehicle fleet and various other things, we don’t talk about — at least I don’t think about states as being major players at the level of shaping what their resource mix looks like. Is that because I, is that because I just don’t know things? Or is that like, is that because I’m ignorant? Or is that because there is something kind of unique and interesting about offshore wind, or maybe unique and interesting about where state’s decarbonization goals are going to have to take governments?</p><p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> I think in some ways it’s sort of a back to the future kind of thing. Yeah, I guess it changes who’s, like, who’s in the driver’s seat, right? Historically, we had vertically integrated monopoly utilities, and in much of the country that’s still the case, like in the Southeast and much of the West. But in about, you know, 60% of the country, fairly recently, like around 2000, in early 2000s, we basically restructured the markets to say, you know what, for at least generation and wholesale large power plants, and maybe also for retail sales, like who signs you up as a customer and, you know, does your billing and provide some other services, we’re going to open that part of it up to competition, and we’ll keep the wires part the network utility because that makes sense. But we’ll let the generators all compete with each other. And now the market is in the driver’s seat. And what does the market build an enormous amount of natural gas.</p><p><strong>Meyer:</strong> I was gonna say, the market the market falls over itself to build natural gas. Yeah. The market goes to sleep and wakes up, and it’s just surrounded by extra natural gas plants that it made while it was sleeping.</p><p><strong>Jenkins: </strong>Yeah. And bankruptcies.</p><p><strong>Meyer:</strong> And bankruptcies. Yes. Exactly. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Jenkins: </strong>So the wisdom of the market overbuilt a huge amount of gas in an attempt to get regulated utilities for to stop overbuilding a huge amount of nuclear and coal plants. That’s a cycle we went through. And then states, again, around similar times, like, start to get more and more concerned about climate change and clean energy and reducing their exposure to what, at that point, we talked about in the last episode, were increasing natural gas prices right in the early, in the mid 2000s. And they say, you know what, we should actually take a little bit more of a hand here and shape how the market works. And they still did it in a relatively hands off way through what are known as renewable portfolio standards.</p><p>So these are basically laws that say to the utility, okay, you get to, you know, the market can shape the mix, but you have to buy a certain amount of your electricity from clean resources or a certain qualifying renewable resources. But you decide: offshore wind, onshore wind, solar, whatever. And then what changed, really, is these resource-specific procurements that we’re now seeing. And wind is the most salient, but also we’re seeing procurements of utility-scale solar in certain states.</p><p>And actually, I think the most, the most interesting one is, is the recent law passed in North Carolina by the legislature, which is basically like a resource plan in law. You know, build this many megawatts of this shut down this many megawatts of coal, build these many megawatts of offshore wind, 50% of that the utility gets to own, this much has to go to market. It’s like the legislature taking the driver’s seat now and writing through law what they want the resource mix to look like. And that’s, I think, the thing that has shifted, right. It’s the legislature driving resource procurement. And that is, that is new.</p><p><strong>Meyer: </strong>And I think there is, like, a “Just when I got out, they pulled me back in” aspect to all of this, I think. Where, it seemed like, for reasons having to do with broader ideas floating around about how markets were smart and how what often seemed like the very corrupt nature of the kind of state regulatory and monopoly utility interface that these, you know, the states were very corrupted by the utilities, the utilities were very corrupted by the state. But I guess what I’m saying is that there was this move toward markets, and that since then, and then even with the RPS, as you said, there’s still this kind of market technology neutral, well, we’re open to all kinds of portfolios. And what we’re discovering is for reasons that mostly, I think have to do with physics, you wind up — states kind of wound up right back where they started, where it’s like, okay, well, now we’re actually. it’s just easier if we plan this.</p><p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> I do think there’s still I mean, I think there’s some of that, I think. I think there’s a lot more politics going on here. I would shade into the story.</p><p><strong>Meyer:</strong> By all means, yes.</p><p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> Yes. There is some local opposition to offshore wind. There is a lot of economic, salience or political salience to being able to say to some of the working shoreline communities — which we did have long ago, right? And being able to go there and say, we’re going to build a $500 million revitalization of the port of New Bedford in Massachusetts or New London in Connecticut or Staten Island in New York or Brooklyn, where they’re building these terminals and drive a huge amount of employment and investment and revitalization in these communities. That’s why the politics of offshore wind is so attractive.</p><p>Also, because the components are so big and because the state is shaping it, they can add these riders about local benefits in manufacturing. A lot of the manufactured components for these turbines are also coming from the area. So there’s the steel piles you have to drive into the ground, called monopiles. The towers, the blades, the turbines, they’re all getting built in New York and New Jersey and Virginia and elsewhere, and creating manufacturing jobs in communities that were previously depressed. And, you know, politicians can go to ribbon cuttings and point to their legislation and say, we did this right.</p><p>So I think that’s a big piece of why the legislatures are so attracted to offshore wind, is it does create a lot of jobs and a lot of investment and a lot of local manufacturing activity. And I think that’s part of why the legislature has basically decided we’re willing to pay a lot more for offshore wind than we would be for, say, a transmission line to wind in a state inland is that it might be a lot cheaper.</p><p><strong>Meyer: </strong>Is that a good thing? I mean, I guess I just —</p><p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> Yeah, I don’t you —</p><p><strong>Meyer: </strong>You know me, like, I love industrial policy blah blah blah. However, I will say when you look across the U.S. and you look at projects that have been considered to be drivers of economic development in a direct way instead of an indirect way, by which I mean, like when you look at these big public projects where some of the stated top line benefits of these projects are like, creates many jobs, creates, helps three dozen small businesses. You don’t … it’s not exactly a record that like covers itself in glory. Like, you know, California high speed rail remains unbuilt. But the director, you know, like people involved with California high speed rail, sometimes they’re like, well, it’s actually been very successful because we’ve supported all these jobs and we’ve supported all these businesses. And it’s like, still, you know, this, all this economic activity. But of course, the thing hasn’t been built yet, actually doing the thing that we wanted to do, which is move people quickly from L.A. to San Francisco. Is it good that we’re looking at that? Legislatures look at offshore wind and they’re like, oh, look at all those jobs in it rather than like … yeah, yeah.</p><p><strong>Jenkins: </strong>Yeah. I mean, let me go on the record and say, I am not a fan of resource planning by the state legislatures. I mean, I think that, you know, as a deliberative democracy, you know, democratic body or representative body, right? They have a role in representing the combined stakeholder interests. But, you know, when it comes to, when it comes to making energy policy, we all know that there are certain stakeholders who have a lot more access and a lot more influence in, you know, state legislatures than others, and are likely to sort of shift things in certain directions. And so what I have counseled — and I’ve been asked to advise state legislatures and, and policymakers in a number of contexts. And what I have advised is to say, look, you are balancing real goals here, right there. There are several different objectives we’re trying to achieve. Right? We want to reach a cleaner energy mix because we’re trying to combat climate change and reduce air pollution and improve environmental justice, and all those goals. So we want a clean mix, but also, I’m sure we’ll do an episode on this later, the electricity sector has to play a much bigger role in powering our lives in a cleaner future, right?</p><p><strong>Meyer: </strong>Load must go up.</p><p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> Electric cars and other industries … Yeah, yeah, there just has to be a lot more electricity generated, period, to electrify so many different things, from EVs to heat pumps to industry. Yeah. And if you do that, you know, not putting aside, you know, so that even from the climate concern, you have to worry yourself about affordability of this transition, as well. If you make electricity prices two or three times more expensive, that’s going to make it a lot harder to electrify all those industries. And it’s going to make, you know, energy costs for low income and fixed income residents go up and, you know, there’s justice implications of that. It’s going to make your small businesses and competitive businesses or businesses and competitive industries less competitive, you know, with other states. So there’s an affordability concern that’s always front and center in these conversations. And then there’s this economic development concern.</p><p>Obviously, state legislatures are historically interested in driving economic investment and in development in their state. That’s a big part of what they do. And so you’re balancing these three things, right. You know, affordability, clean energy and climate goals and in-state economic development. And I have simply recommended that you focus on the ends and not the means. So if those are your goals, let’s write into the law that you know, we’re going to have X percent clean energy and we want y percentage of that to be in state because of economic development goals. And we want to put a cost containment provision in here that says we won’t build those offshore wind or those in-state projects if it costs more than Z, because that’s how much we’re willing to pay for that insane development. And then go let the utilities or a state agency contract for whatever the cheapest way is to meet that goal, right, to maintain your affordability goals. And maybe that’s offshore wind in certain places, and maybe it’s not.</p><p><strong>Meyer: </strong>I’m going to really mangle this concept because it is not exactly creative to describe this, but there was a Hungarian anthropologist and political economist named Karl Polanyi. It’s also a name I’m probably not saying correctly. Yeah, I’m choosing to pronounce his name like he’s a Chicago guy. Karl Polanyi, you know, down by Wabash.</p><p><strong>Jenkins: </strong>He’s a good guy, he’s got the pizza shop.</p><p><strong>Meyer: </strong>He, he, he has this idea of fictitious commodities, which are kind of things that you have to treat as a commodity to make the whole system work, to make the whole economy work, but are not themselves commodities. They don’t really work like actual commodities. And his big three examples are land, labor and money. He was writing during the 1940s, but it feels like electricity is one of them. I’m like, I’m, I’m adapting this idea to a situation that was not designed to apply to, but it does feel kind of like to describe the whole nature of how we think about electricity, which is this extremely important thing that mostly remains kind of mired in technical discussion, but nonetheless makes the whole world work.</p><p><strong>Jenkins: </strong>Yeah, no that sounds about right. And I think that describes sort of the pendulum swinging back and forth. And so, you know, where I, where I do think we have opportunity here is to say, look, we have public objectives. We can, we know that these are high upfront cost, you know, capital intensive projects that once you build them, are just going to produce cheap energy for a long period of time. Right? Their marginal costs are low, and so the cost of capital is really important, and the cost to build the project is really important. Right. Those are the two determinants of how much a wind farm is going to cost. So we can use long term public contracts to drive down the cost of capital by basically guaranteeing revenue to developers so that the risk is low and they can get a low-cost loan from a bank and build the project. That’s what we’re doing with all these procurements at the state level. And we can use competitive forces like auctions to ensure that the cheapest projects are the ones we’re going to buy. And I just think we should open that up from offshore wind specifically, or rooftop solar specifically to whatever resources are built in the state that can meet our climate goals and deliver some economic development benefits at the lowest cost. And so it’s just a question of like, how do you define that market goal and harness those competitive dynamics to deliver the public policy goals? That’s what the auctions are doing.</p><p><strong>Meyer: </strong>That’s kind of like in some ways, related to this change that is going to happen and how the Inflation Reduction Act conducts its subsidies, right? Which is since the 1980s, we’ve been in a situation where, like, we, the U.S. tax code incentivizes certain types of technology. And then starting in 2025, I believe the U.S. tax code will just incentivize all kinds of zero carbon electricity instead of calling out certain technology. It’s just saying, however you can do it, we’re going to pay you the subsidy. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Jenkins: </strong>And also layering on a couple of other economic development objectives. Right. You have to meet prevailing wage and you have to it if you build domestic content, you get more money. And if you build energy in communities that we want to help transition, you get more money. So yeah, it’s an interesting example of that where you’re sort of layering these multiple objectives on, but still relying on the market to go deliver the lowest cost, most competitive ways to do that.</p><p>[AD BREAK]</p><p><strong>Meyer: </strong>Let’s do downshifts first because I think we should end on an upshift.</p><p><strong>Jenkins: </strong>That sounds good. Let’s end on the up note. So my downshift, speaking of utilities and regulation, and actually tying back to last episode winners and losers from trade, my downshift is a recent report by the Energy and Policy Institute, which is a public interest watchdog that keeps an eye on state utility regulation, on how a number of monopoly utilities, particularly those in the Southeast, where they are still vertically integrated, so they still own transmission and generation, have been routinely pushing back against efforts to build more long distance transmission, and also to organize into larger regional markets that can, you know, expand the footprint of trade across a wider area — something that’s happened in all of the competitive markets in the state and the country — in order to basically protect their turf, right? So customers in their territories would benefit from access to cheaper resources further away, and the transmission lines that could bring that power to those customers. But the utilities in these areas make their money, like most utilities, by investing capital and getting a return on those investments. And they don’t get money in somebody else’s generator. And this is an area where unless the state regulators are really acting in the public interest and leaning in here and making sure that the utility is not kind of basically abusing its control of the network to act as a monopoly, then there’s every economic incentive for the state or for the there’s every economic incentive for the utility to do that. And that’s exactly what we should expect.</p><p><strong>Meyer: </strong>My downshift is, so we’re coming up on the first anniversary of Heatmap — that’s not my downshift.</p><p><strong>Jenkins: </strong>It’s been that bad, huh, Rob?</p><p><strong>Meyer: </strong>I’m very excited about that! No, no, no, my downshift is, it turns out that, as Neel Dhanesha wrote for Heatmap today, Heatmap’s first 12 months in existence more or less co-existed with the first 12 months where the Earth was 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperature. So from February 2023 through January 2024, the average global temperature was 1.5 degrees C higher than what we think of as kind of the 19th century baseline. And that’s according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service, the EU climate data service. Now, I should say that just because we’ve had this 12-month period where temperatures were more than 1.5 C above the pre-industrial average, does not mean we have passed the so-called 1.5 C threshold, which also, we should be clear, is not a physical thing. It’s more kind of like a construct. It’s a political construct that we use to talk about when climate change starts to get very bad. So we have not passed that threshold. It is not a point of no return.</p><p><strong>Jenkins: </strong>But it is nonetheless an ominous signpost.</p><p><strong>Meyer: </strong>It is nonetheless an ominous sign. And of course, we pass it this year because because of El Niño, which has caused additional atmospheric warming on top of what we’re observing with climate change. But it is nonetheless, exactly, an ominous signpost.</p><p><strong>Jenkins: </strong>Well, my, my upshift is on heat pumps, so maybe that’s why you named it Heatmap, too. Yeah. My upshift today is, is about heat pumps. Heat pumps are a magical device that allow you to move way more heat around with small amounts of electricity through the magic of the thermodynamic cycle.</p><p><strong>Meyer: </strong>We should do an episode where you just explain how heat pumps work.</p><p><strong>Jenkins: </strong>Magical gnomes.</p><p><strong>Meyer: </strong>Like, how does the thermos know whether to keep the liquid hot or cold? </p><p><strong>Jenkins: </strong>Yeah. So heat pumps are magic. There are like, 300% to 500% efficient, effectively, because you can use a little bit of electricity to move, you know, two, three, or five times as much heat around. And so that makes them a really great way to both improve energy efficiency and shift from burning fossil fuels in our basement, in furnaces, oil or gas boilers or furnaces to a clean electricity source. So that reduces air pollution. And of course, if we can produce all that electricity with clean resources, we’ve helped decarbonize home heating. So it’s a central technology in any decarbonization and environmental justice strategy, I should say, because it’s a big source of air pollution. And so my upshift is from Michael Thomas, who writes a newsletter called <em>Distilled</em> and is active on Twitter and shared a great thread today compiling some data on recent heat pump trends in the U.S., where he found that heat pumps have been outselling gas furnaces for the last two years in a row, in 2022 and 2023. And that I thought, most interestingly, the share of homes in the U.S. with heat pumps has gone up in 48 of 50 states over the last decade, and the most rapid progress has been driven by states that have recently taken policy action to try to accelerate adoption of heat pumps.</p><p>Maine is probably the most exciting story. They basically doubled their heat pump adoption rate in just two years. And if they kept that up, that’s crazy to hit. Yeah, and they’re actually on track to hit, yeah, to get heat pumps in every home in Maine by 2050. And there’s a reason for Maine to do this: because Maine is not on the natural gas system. So there, people in Maine are mostly heating with fuel oil and propane, which has gotten incredibly expensive over the last few years, and obviously does that periodically because of all those ups and downs and global oil prices that we mentioned on the last episode. So, yeah, Maine is an interesting case. It’s cold. A lot of people don’t think heat pumps can work in cold climates. Well, that’s definitely not true. There’s huge heat pump adoption in Scandinavian countries and in Canada. And now in Maine. You just have to design them, right? And probably also do some energy efficiency improvements to seal up your home when you do it. But yeah, we’re moving in the right direction on heat pumps.</p><p><strong>Meyer: </strong>Home heating oil is so crazy because it’s like, imagine heating your house with gasoline.</p><p><strong>Jenkins: </strong>Yeah, exactly. Diesel. But dirtier.</p><p><strong>Meyer: </strong>Right. It’s so interesting. My upshift. Is that a new analysis in <em>Carbon Brief</em> from Lauri Myllyvirta, who is kind of one of the leading analysts of China’s greenhouse gas emissions. And he found, basically, China’s emissions may have peaked last year. That kind of, if you look at all the factors in their economy, it’s very likely China’s emissions will go down this year in 2024 compared to 2023. That, now, that’s partially — and I would say, this is suboptimal. This is not the upper part of the upshift. That’s partially because of just very soft economic activity in China. As we record this, the Chinese stock markets have basically been falling apart over the past few days. It’s that kind of softness of industrial activity matched with this massive, massive build out of renewables that is going to that that in his analysis is going to peak, lead China’s emissions to decline in 2024, and may cause them to permanently kind of subside.</p><p>And I think the other interesting aspect of this is at the same time he sees this, he also sees, I think, what people tend to notice more, which is that China’s continuing to build coal overcapacity in its power grid. It’s continuing to build a lot of new coal plants, and it kind of talks about how there is this clash coming up between the cleaner parts of the economy and the cleaner subsectors, or the new energy subsectors, versus the kind of old fossil subsectors, both of which are building, but eventually their needs will directly conflict.</p><p><strong>Jenkins: </strong>That’s fascinating. Yeah, we should definitely do an episode on what the heck is going on in China. You know, one of those major signposts that we have to pass if we’re going to get the world on track for net zero, is peak emissions in China the world’s biggest emitter? And until China turns the corner, you know, we won’t be able to turn the corner globally to get emissions on a downward trajectory either. Most likely. So yeah, I’d be really fascinated to see are we are we nearly at that peak. That’s some encouraging signs, but we’re not quite sure yet. All right.</p><p><strong>Meyer:</strong> Let’s, yeah, let’s …</p><p><strong>Jenkins: </strong>Let’s leave it there and let’s come pick up the China story again in a future episode here on Shift Key.</p><p><strong>Meyer: </strong>Here on Shift Key. You want to share your friend’s line about what our next podcast should be called?</p><p><strong>Jenkins: </strong>Let me find that. Yeah. So a friend and early listener said, are we going to start a recurring section about emissions trading called Caps Lock? I think we have to.</p><p><strong>Meyer: </strong>And California has to re-up its emissions trading system pretty soon, or it’s going to try to do it pretty soon.</p><p><strong>Jenkins: </strong>So maybe we’ll have a special issue.</p><p><strong>Meyer: </strong>Special Caps Lock edition of Shift Key. Well, thank you for listening to Shift Key. And we’ll be back next week. And in the meantime, subscribe. And please, if you have a friend, an ally, a coworker, a nemesis, a jilted lover who you think would enjoy the stimulating discussion and intelligent conversation of Shift Key. Please. Share the podcast with them and ask them to subscribe.</p><p><strong>Jenkins: </strong>See you next week.</p><p><strong>Meyer: </strong>Shift Key is a production of Heatmap News. The podcast was edited by Jillian Goodman. Our editor in chief is Nico Lauricella, multimedia editing and audio engineering by Jacob Lambert and Nick Woodbury. Our music is by Adam Kromelow. Thanks so much for listening and see you next week.</p>

I'm getting good at it. Yesterday I did that with the <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/02/13.html#a214721">piece</a> about President Biden and how he probably would rather be doing anything than be President, for a mostly thankless country, at age 81. I imagine he has great-grandchildren he'd like to get to know. Maybe a book or two to read, maybe one to write. To get his affairs in order. At age 68 I'm trying to shed responsibility as much as possible. It's prudent, and has a point. When I was 25 I wanted to take over the world. Now I'd just like to feel good. As you get older you are capable of more depth of feeling, in some ways, and grow more numb in others. I spent time with my father at 80, his last year. He was always a curious man, wanting to learn about anything new, but in his last days he wasn't curious. No ambition. But he seemed okay with it, even happy at times (possibly due in part to the morphine he was allowed). Anyway, it's always interesting to see where people react to what among the different social web networks. And in this case, the most flow came from <a href="https://mastodon.social/@davew/111926409460785756">Mastodon</a>, by far. I would not have predicted that. And it's good to see, that interesting ideas and perspective may have more of a future outside the networks operated by the billionaire tech companies.

## Ai and Robots

<p>David Pierce at The Verge just published a great long-form piece about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24067997/robots-txt-ai-text-file-web-crawlers-spiders">robots.txt</a>, the relationship between the people running websites and the people running spiders and crawlers, and what’s happening now that AI has entered the scene.</p>
<p>It’s a great piece and the timing is convenient for me personally because just the other day I emailed the lovely people at The Browser Company asking how can I opt out of their stupid <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/a-rant-on-arc-search">ARC Search</a>. They care about users and user experience and so do I so I’m sure they must have a way for me to block their new AI. I’m still waiting to get a reply…</p>

## Pluralistic: Prison-tech is a brutal scam – and a harbinger of your future (14 Feb 2024)

date: 2024-02-14, from: Cory Doctorow's blog

Today's links Prison-tech is a brutal scam &#8211; and a harbinger of your future: My next novel predicts the present. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2013, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading Prison-tech is a brutal scam &#8211; and a harbinger of your future (permalink) Here's how the shitty technology adoption curve works: when you want to roll out a new, abusive technology, look for a group of vulnerable people whose complaints are roundly ignored and subject them to your bad idea. Sand the rough edges off on their bodies and lives. Normalize the technological abuse you seek to inflict. Next: work your way up the privilege gradient. Maybe you start with prisoners, then work your way up to asylum seekers, parolees and mental patients. Then try it on kids and gig workers. Now, college students and blue collar workers. Climb that curve, bit by bit, until you've reached its apex and everyone is living with your shitty technology: https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/24/gwb-rumsfeld-monsters/#bossware Prisoners, asylum seekers, drug addicts and other marginalized people are the involuntary early adopters of every form of disciplinary technology. They are the leading indicators of the ways that technology will be ruining your life in the future. They are the harbingers of all our technological doom. Which brings me to Minnesota. Minnesota is one of the first states make prison phone-calls free. This is a big deal, because prison phone-calls are a big business. Prisoners are literally a captive audience, and the telecommunications sector is populated by sociopaths, bred and trained to spot and exploit abusive monopoly opportunities. As states across America locked up more and more people for longer and longer terms, the cost of operating prisons skyrocketed, even as states slashed taxes on the rich and turned a blind eye to tax evasion. This presented telco predators with an unbeatable opportunity: they approached state prison operators and offered them a bargain: "Let us take over the telephone service to your carceral facility and we will levy eye-watering per-minute charges on the most desperate people in the world. Their families &#8211; struggling with one breadwinner behind bars &#8211; will find the money to pay this ransom, and we'll split the profits with you, the cash-strapped, incarceration-happy state government." This was the opening salvo, and it turned into a fantastic little money-spinner. Prison telco companies and state prison operators were the public-private partnership from hell. Prison-tech companies openly funneled money to state coffers in the form of kickbacks, even as they secretly bribed prison officials to let them gouge their inmates and inmates' families: https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/02/mississippi-corrections-corruption-bribery-private-prison-hustle/ As digital technology got cheaper and prison-tech companies got greedier, the low end of the shitty tech adoption curve got a lot more crowded. Prison-tech companies started handing out "free" cheap Android tablets to prisoners, laying the groundwork for the next phase of the scam. Once prisoners had tablets, prisons could get rid of phones altogether and charge prisoners &#8211; and their families &#8211; even higher rates to place calls right to the prisoner's cell. Then, prisons could end in-person visits and replace them with sub-skype, postage-stamp-sized videoconferencing, at rates even higher than the voice-call rates. Combine that with a ban on mailing letters to and from prisoners &#8211; replaced with a service that charged even higher rates to scan mail sent to prisoners, and then charged prisoners to download the scans &#8211; and prison-tech companies could claim to be at the vanguard of prison safety, ending the smuggling of dope-impregnated letters and other contraband into the prison system. Prison-tech invented some wild shit, like the "digital stamp," a mainstay of industry giant Jpay, which requires prisoners to pay for "stamps" to send or receive a "page" of email. If you're keeping score, you've realized that this is a system where prisoners and their families have to pay for calls, "in-person" visits, handwritten letters, and email. It goes on: prisons shuttered their libraries and replaced them with ebook stores that charged 2-4 times the prices you'd pay for books on the outside. Prisoners were sold digital music at 200-300% markups relative to, say, iTunes. Remember, these are prisoners: locked up for years or decades, decades during which their families scraped by with a breadwinner behind bars. Prisoners can earn money, sure &#8211; as much as $0.89/hour, doing forced labor for companies that contract with prisons for their workforce: https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2017/04/10/wages/ Of course, there's the odd chance for prisoners to make really big bucks &#8211; $2-5/day. All they have to do is "volunteer" to fight raging wildfires: https://www.hcn.org/articles/climate-desk-wildfire-california-incarcerated-firefighters-face-dangerous-work-low-pay-and-covid19/ So those $3 digital music tracks are being bought by people earning as little as $0.10/hour. Which makes it especially galling when prisons change prison-tech suppliers, whereupon all that digital music is deleted, wiping prisoners' media collection out &#8211; forever (literally, for prisoners serving life terms): https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/08/captive-audience-how-floridas-prisons-and-drm-made-113m-worth-prisoners-music Let's recap: America goes on a prison rampage, locking up ever-larger numbers of people for ever-longer sentences. Once inside, prisoners had their access to friends and family rationed, along with access to books, music, education and communities outside. This is very bad for prisoners &#8211; strong ties to people outside is closely tied to successful reentry &#8211; but it's great for state budgets, and for wardens, thanks to kickbacks: https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2021/12/21/family_contact/ Back to Minnesota: when Minnesota became the fourth state in the USA where the state, not prisoners, would pay for prison calls, it seemed like they were finally breaking the vicious cycle in which every dollar ripped off of prisoners' family paid 40 cents to the state treasury: https://www.kaaltv.com/news/no-cost-phone-calls-for-those-incarcerated-in-minnesota/ But &#8211; as Katya Schwenk writes for The Lever &#8211; what happened next is "a case study in how prison communication companies and their private equity owners have managed to preserve their symbiotic relationship with state corrections agencies despite reforms — at the major expense of incarcerated people and their families": https://www.levernews.com/wall-streets-new-prison-scam/ Immediately after the state ended the ransoming of prisoners' phone calls, the private-equity backed prison-tech companies that had dug their mouth-parts into the state's prison jacked up the price of all their other digital services. For example, the price of a digital song in a Minnesota prison just jumped from $1.99 to $2.36 (for prisoners earning as little as $0.25/hour). As Paul Wright from the Human Rights Defense Center told Schwenk, "The ideal world for the private equity owners of these companies is every prisoner has one of their tablets, and every one of those tablets is hooked up to the bank account of someone outside of prison that they can just drain." The state's new prison-tech supplier promises to double the amount of kickbacks it pays the state each year, thanks to an aggressive expansion into games, money transfers, and other "services." The perverse incentive isn't hard to spot: the more these prison-tech companies charge, the more kickbacks they pay to the prisons. The primary prison-tech company for Minnesota's prisons is Viapath (nee Global Tel Link), which pioneered price-gouging on in-prison phone calls. Viapath has spent the past two decades being bought and sold by different private equity firms: Goldman Sachs, Veritas Capital, and now the $46b/year American Securities. Viapath competes with another private equity-backed prison-tech giant: Aventiv (Securus, Jpay), owned by Platinum Equity. Together, Viapath and Aventiv control 90% of the prison-tech market. These companies have a rap-sheet as long as your arm: bribing wardens, stealing from prisoners and their families, and recording prisoner-attorney calls. But these are the kinds of crimes the state punishes with fines and settlements &#8211; not by terminating its contracts with these predators. These companies continue to flout the law. Minnesota's new free-calls system bans prison-tech companies from paying kickbacks to prisons and prison-officials for telcoms services, so the prison-tech companies have rebranded ebooks, music, and money-transfers as non-communications products, and the kickbacks are bigger than ever. This is the bottom end of the shitty technology adoption curve. Long before Ubisoft started deleting games that you'd bought a "perpetual license" for, prisoners were having their media ganked by an uncaring corporation that knew it was untouchable: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIqyvquTEVU Revoking your media, charging by the byte for messaging, confiscating things in the name of security and then selling them back to you &#8211; these are all tactics that were developed in the prison system, refined, normalized, and then worked up the privilege gradient. Prisoners are living in your technology future. It's just not evenly distributed &#8211; yet. As it happens, prison-tech is at the heart of my next novel, The Bezzle, which comes out on Feb 20. This is a followup to last year's bestselling Red Team Blues, which introduced the world to Marty Hench, a two-fisted, hard-bitten, high-tech forensic accountant who's spent 40 years busting Silicon Valley finance scams: https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865878/thebezzle In The Bezzle, we travel with Marty back to the mid 2000s (Hench is a kind of tech-scam Zelig and every book is a standalone tale of high-tech ripoffs from a different time and place). Marty's trying to help his old pal Scott Warms, a once-high-flying founder who's fallen prey to California's three-strikes law and is now facing decades in a state pen. As bad as things are, they get worse when the prison starts handing out "free" tablet and closing down the visitation room, the library, and the payphones. This is an entry to the thing I love most about the Hench novels: the opportunity to turn all this dry, financial skullduggery into high-intensity, high-stakes technothriller plot. For me, Marty Hench is a tool for flensing the scam economy of all its layers of respectability bullshit and exposing the rot at the core. It's not a coincidence that I've got a book coming out in a week that's about something that's in the news right now. I didn't "predict" this current turn &#8211; I observed it. The world comes at you fast and technology news flutters past before you can register it. Luckily, I have a method for capturing this stuff as it happens: https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/09/the-memex-method/ Writing about tech issues that are long-simmering but still in the periphery is a technique I call "predicting the present." It's the technique I used when I wrote Little Brother, about out-of-control state surveillance of the internet. When Snowden revealed the extent of NSA spying in 2013, people acted as though I'd "predicted" the Snowden revelations: https://www.wired.com/story/his-writing-radicalized-young-hackers-now-he-wants-to-redeem-them/ But Little Brother and Snowden's own heroic decision have a common origin: the brave whistleblower Mark Klein, who walked into EFF's offices in 2006 and revealed that he'd been ordered by his boss at AT&#38;T to install a beam-splitter into the main fiber trunk so that the NSA could illegally wiretap the entire internet: https://www.eff.org/document/public-unredacted-klein-declaration Mark Klein inspired me to write Little Brother &#8211; but despite national press attention, the Klein revelations didn't put a stop to NSA spying. The NSA was still conducting its lawless surveillance campaign in 2013, when Snowden, disgusted with NSA leadership for lying to Congress under oath, decided to blow the whistle again: https://apnews.com/article/business-33a88feb083ea35515de3c73e3d854ad The assumption that let the NSA get away with mass surveillance was that it would only be weaponized against the people at the bottom of the shitty technology adoption curve: brown people, mostly in other countries. The Snowden revelations made it clear that these were just the beginning, and sure enough, more than a decade later, we have data-brokers sucking up billions in cop kickbacks to enable warrantless surveillance, while virtually following people to abortion clinics, churches, and protests. Mass surveillance is chugging its way up the shitty tech adoption curve with no sign of stopping. Like Little Brother, The Bezzle is intended as a kind of virtual flythrough of what life is like further down on that curve &#8211; a way for readers who have too much agency to be in the crosshairs of a company like Viapath or Avently right now to wake up before that kind of technology comes for them, and to inspire them to take up the cause of the people further down the curve who are mired in it. The Bezzle is an intense book, but it's also a very fun story &#8211; just like Little Brother. It's a book that lays bare the internal technical workings of so many scams, from multi-level marketing to real-estate investment trusts, from music royalty theft to prison-tech, in the course of an ice-cold revenge plot that keeps twisting to the very last page. It'll drop in six days.

## The fun little JackRabbit micro e-bike gets a gigantic new battery, 2.5x the range

## A Market for 24/7 Clean Power Might Look Something Like This

date: 2024-02-14, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDkwMzE5NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczOTM5MDkxOH0.LfTKK2x1I1jWUEqOwP7Gf3Gk80Poec0atDejWCHQMFE/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">There are two kinds of people who work on climate solutions: Those who still believe in the promise of carbon markets, and those who think the whole concept is fundamentally flawed.</p>
<p>In the first category, you have people like McGee Young, the CEO of a company called WattCarbon. Young is aware of the ways carbon markets can be a race to the bottom — enabling companies to buy cheap certificates that say they used clean energy or reduced their carbon footprint, when in reality their purchase had little effect on the environment or the energy system. </p>
<p>And yet, there’s all this money out there for the taking! Companies want to green their image! Tackling climate change is expensive! There must be a way to funnel corporate sustainability budgets to where they can make a real impact! </p>
<p>To Young, the solution is a matter of better data and greater transparency. “We need a record-keeping system that allows us to raise the bar,” he told me.</p>
<p>Young launched his vision for that record-keeping system on Wednesday — the WattCarbon Energy Attribute Tracking System, or WEATS. It functions similarly to other environmental credit registries: Owners of clean energy assets can sign up to generate credits known as Environmental Attribute Certificates, or EACs, which buyers can then purchase to count toward their own clean energy or carbon goals.</p>
<p>WEATS has two main features that differentiate it. First, it will include credits from small-scale distributed energy resources like residential solar panels, batteries, and heat pumps — clean energy solutions that haven’t really been able to participate in carbon markets until now. Second, each EAC will include granular information about where and when the power was generated, in the case of solar, or the carbon savings incurred, in the case of heat pumps, down to the hour.</p>
<p>The first feature is part of what motivated Young to start WattCarbon. “The clean energy transition is more than just wind and solar, it’s more than just generation,” he told me. But it’s the second that Young said is key to improving the credibility of claims that companies are “using 100% clean energy,” or “achieving net-zero.” </p>
<p>Today, many companies simply buy enough clean energy credits to match their annual energy use, regardless of where or when the energy was generated. But researchers have shown that this strategy can have little to no impact on emissions. For example, if a company is only buying solar credits, but it is using energy at night, its carbon footprint from that nighttime energy could surpass any environmental benefits of the solar it bought. </p>
<p>To solve this, some energy buyers have embraced a concept called “24/7 carbon-free energy,” which means that “every kilowatt-hour of electricity consumption is met with carbon-free electricity sources, every hour of every day, everywhere,” in the words of a <a href="https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/2021/10/24-7cfe_compact_-_v2_updated.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">United Nations-led initiative</a> to promote the concept. “It is both the end state of a fully decarbonized electricity system,” according to the UN, “and a transformative approach to energy procurement, supply, and policy design that is critical to accelerating its arrival.”</p>
<p>If you’ve followed the recent debate about the green hydrogen tax credit, you might be familiar with the idea. In December, <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/hydrogen-rule-biden-clean-energy" target="_self">the Treasury Department proposed</a> that hydrogen producers will have to match their electricity consumption with the purchase of local clean electricity generation <em>on an hourly basis</em> to prove their hydrogen is clean enough to qualify for the full value of the tax credit. That means producers can either hook up directly to a solar farm or wind farm or geothermal power plant and operate only when it is generating power, or, it can buy renewable energy credits or EACs that correspond to the hours that it operates. </p>
<p>WattCarbon’s marketplace is one of the first to enable this by requiring sellers to include data about exactly where and when each EAC was produced. It also include the carbon intensity of the grid in the place and time when that unit of power was produced. For example, 1 megawatt-hour of solar power in West Virginia, where the grid is supplied by a lot of coal-fired power plants, would likely reduce emissions far more than 1 megawatt-hour of solar power in California, where the main fossil fuel burned for power is natural gas. Similarly, 1 megawatt-hour of solar generated in the afternoon in California will not do as much to reduce emissions as if that unit of power were stored in a battery and then dispatched at night. On other markets, all of these credits might simply be advertised as 1 megawatt-hour of solar power, and the buyer would be none the wiser.</p>
<p>So what does this new carbon trading marketplace look like in practice? There are a lot of possibilities, but here’s one scenario. WattCarbon partners with a company that helps homeowners electrify their heating or install and manage their solar and battery systems. That third party company can then say to their customers, “As an extra incentive to do this, we can help you sell the environmental benefits it provides to third parties through the WattCarbon marketplace,” and those extra payments are what convinces the homeowner to go for it.</p>
<p>Independent experts I spoke with were cautiously optimistic about what this new marketplace could do. “We need to deploy <a href="https://saulgriffith.medium.com/one-billion-machines-48a7c3cf0694" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on the order of a billion machines</a>, in the U.S. alone — and not over a century, but on the order of a decade,” said Kevin Kircher, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue University, whose research focuses on heat pumps and other distributed energy resources. “So there’s a lot that needs to be done, and just connecting people to money to do the work is really important.”</p>
<p>Wilson Ricks, a PhD candidate at Princeton University whose research informed the Treasury’s proposal for the hydrogen tax credit, said that having a platform where hydrogen companies can procure clean energy from a variety of projects, and with time and location data, would be very useful. He was also intrigued by WattCarbon’s attempt to create EACs tied to batteries because energy storage systems are one of the few resources that can produce clean power when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining. </p>
<p>But both Ricks and Kircher warned there are a number of ways this system of credits could fall into the same traps that ensnare many carbon offset projects and reduce their credibility. For one, it’s really hard to get the math right. That’s especially true for a project like a heat pump, where the carbon savings are based on a counterfactual situation where the homeowner would have kept their gas heater. You have to basically estimate how often they would have run it, which opens the door to sloppiness at best and fraud at worst.</p>
<p>Another key criterion — a concept called additionality — is very hard to assess. Would the household that switches to a heat pump have done so regardless of whether they were getting extra revenue from selling EACs? If the answer is unequivocally yes, the credits are meaningless and serve to give corporate emitters an excuse to keep emitting. </p>
<p>Young acknowledged to me that this was likely going to be true in some cases, but still felt that heat pump owners deserved to be paid for the environmental benefits they were providing. “We provide environmental subsidies for large-scale wind and solar, and we don't do that for the things that we're putting into our buildings and our communities. And to me, there’s an inherent inequality in the way that we treat and value clean energy that needs to be addressed.”</p>
<p>That didn’t quite make sense to me — the government provides subsidies for all kinds of clean energy resources, including distributed energy resources, I countered. The Treasury will give you $2,000 for a heat pump and a 30% discount on rooftop solar. </p>
<p>“That’s true,” Young said. “But we don’t have enough money in all of our government programs to truly scale those.” </p>
<p>I couldn’t argue with that. But the real challenge is helping low-income homeowners with the upfront capital to install these devices — after-the-fact payments are not enough. Young said he had plans to create a way for companies to procure EACs in advance from groups of homeowners. The deals would be similar to the power purchase agreements that big electricity consumers like Google and Walmart make with large-scale renewable energy developers, helping to finance those projects by reducing the risk. </p>
<p>“This is a necessary but not sufficient step,” Young said of the version of the marketplace that launched Wednesday. “Without this, we can’t do that. But this by itself would be inadequate for the market to be able to reach its fullest potential.”</p>

## Health Insurers Fret About Climate Change

date: 2024-02-14, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDM0MDAwMC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODQzODE2Nn0.7qLtGHwtvJDuHPOt-W4Ue-pqu3d_1ggV3S7sxzg1utg/image.png?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C1%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/><p>
<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> Much of the U.S. will see calmer weather over the next few days • A tornado caused “biblical damage” in Cyprus • Mexico is experiencing its worst drought in 12 years.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>
1. Study: Polar bears head ashore for food as sea ice melts 
</h3><p>
<strong></strong>A new <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=d7638b5606&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">study</a> sheds light on how polar bears are changing their diets and behaviors in a warming world. Climate change is shrinking the sea ice on which the bears rely for hunting seals. As the ice melts, the bears are forced onto land, where they can either reduce their physical activity in order to save energy and calories, or forage for berries and small prey. The research, which involved strapping cameras to 20 bears in Canada’s Manitoba province, found that neither option is enough to prevent the animals from going hungry. All of them lost weight and two of them were on track to starve before the sea ice was expected to return. “Polar bears are not grizzly bears wearing white coats,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=dcb56610ca&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> Charles Robbins, director of the Washington State University Bear Center and co-author of the study in the journal <em>Nature Communications</em>. “They’re very, very different.” The study found some bears are spending more time in the water, which is “new and unexpected,” one polar bear expert <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=44ef0d603c&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> <em>Vox</em>. “These are possibly acts of desperation. Hungry and skinny bears take more risks than fat bears.”

</iframe></center><h3>2. Health insurers fret about climate change impact</h3><p>
<strong></strong>Health insurance may be the next sector to hike premiums due to climate change, <em>The Wall Street Journal </em><a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=163de5847d&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>. The rise in extreme weather events has already roiled the home insurance market, making it more expensive – or even impossible – for homeowners in some high-risk areas to take out a policy. Now health insurers are “building new models to reassess premiums, estimate risk, and meet incoming climate reporting standards,” the <em>Journal</em> said. Recent research has linked extreme heat and wildfire smoke to a variety of health problems including heart attacks and cancer, and insurers want to know what this all means for their bottom lines. But the <em>Journal</em> reports that for now, insurers aren’t worried about their profits, “because the groups most likely to be affected by climate change aren’t covered by insurance.”
</p><h3>3. Redfin adds air quality tracker to home listings</h3><p>
<strong></strong>In a sign of the times, Redfin has become the first real estate brokerage to <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=6c1c91f143&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">include</a> air quality data alongside home listings. The feature allows house hunters to see the air quality in their prospective new neighborhoods, and tells them whether it is expected to get better or worse in years to come. One <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=4ff04b3a1d&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">home</a> listed in Washington, D.C., for example, came with this warning: “Over the next 30 years, this area will experience a 20.0% increase in the number of poor air quality days, i.e. where the Air Quality Index (AQI) exceeds 100.”

	Redfin already lists other risk factors like flood, fire, heat, and wind. “Redfin wants to ensure that every single person searching for a home has the information they need to understand climate risks,” said Redfin Senior Vice President of Product and Design Ariel Dos Santos. The company also published <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=0f226a5594&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">data</a> this week showing that more people are moving into than out of metro areas that have bad air quality, not necessarily because of health concerns, but because they’ve been priced out.

## 2024-02-09 Oddµ namespaces and live updating

date: 2024-02-14, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>2024-02-09 Oddµ namespaces and live updating</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a slow morning. I had my two cups of coffee, ate my pancakes with plum jam, spent time online reading Mastodon, talked to my wife about wannabe-axe murderers on Swiss trains, looked up stuff about <a href="https://www.tax-the-rich.eu/">taxing the rich</a>…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on Oddmu again. My goal is to be able to reproduce the <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/">Campaign Wiki</a> setup:</p>

<ul>
<li>people can get a &ldquo;space&rdquo; for their site by signing up in some way</li>
<li>they can make changes to the look and feel of their site (change the headers, footers, colours, i.e. make changes to both the HTML template and the CSS)</li>
<li>feeds, list of changes and all that are limited to their site</li>
</ul>

<p>Using Oddmu would also result in the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>sites are no longer publically editable (which isn&rsquo;t a requirement for such spaces like role-playing game campaigns)</li>
</ul>

<p>Oddmu now has the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>when editing pages in a subdirectory, the <code>index</code> and <code>changes</code> page in the same directory are updated (instead of the root directory)</li>
<li>when HTML templates exist in the same directory, those are used instead of the templates in the root directory (e.g. <a href="oddmu/index">Oddµ</a>)</li>
<li>when uploading a HTML template, it is loaded immediately (no more server restart)</li>
</ul>

<p>Once I had this implemented using a library that watches the filesystem for changes, I realized that I could use the same feature to index new pages. This brings me closer to having online and offline writing feature equivalence: Using the web site to create a page should be equivalent to writing a page elsewhere and uploading it to the site via rsync.
(Offline you can use the <code>oddmu notify</code> command to add links to <code>index</code>, <code>changes</code> and hashtag pages.)</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;m getting close!</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Oddµ">#Oddµ</a></p>

<p>Also, code complexity is through the roof, now. All the global maps aren&rsquo;t thread-safe so they need mutexes. There&rsquo;s a weird Heisenbug I have where I run the test suite and then <code>view.html</code> is gone. The next test run then fails, of course. Thinking it was related to the order of tests, I started running <code>go test -shuffle on</code> and found a plethora of <em>other</em> bugs. And I&rsquo;ve seen at least two occasions where I noticed the disappearing <code>view.html</code> bug, noted the shuffle id, reran the test with that id, got the error again, tried for a third time, and then tests passed. So… it must be a race condition of some sort.</p>

<p>How aggravating.</p>

<p>Maybe something got lost, with that last set of changes.</p>

<p>I do feel, however, that I&rsquo;ve found a lot of bugs… Just now, for example, to help prevent Oddmu from showing any directories or files with a path segment starting with a period…</p>

<p><strong>2024-02-14</strong>. I need to think about an archive handler that allows you to get a zip file for the current directory. (I guess zip files are more accessible than .tar.gz files? Like, for Windows and macOS…</p>

<p>And the archive needs to take <a href="2024-02-14-oddmu-bug">ODDMU_FILTER</a> into account!</p>

<p>Done. ✔️</p>

## This Valentine’s Day, a not-so-sweet chocolate economy

date: 2024-02-14, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Lovers and chocolate lovers beware: If you&#8217;re eyeing a heart-shaped box of chocolates for Valentine&#8217;s Day, those bonbons are going to come at a cost. Cocoa prices recently hit an all-time high and sugar prices have spiked too. Rather bittersweet, huh? But first, Tuesday&#8217;s inflation data headed in the wrong direction — and markets were not pleased. Plus, why does Walmart want to buy bargain television brand Vizio?</p>

## Improving the Cryptanalysis of Lattice-Based Public-Key Algorithms

date: 2024-02-14, updated: 2024-02-13, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>The winner of the Best Paper Award at Crypto this year was a <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-38548-3_1">significant improvement</a> to lattice-based cryptanalysis.</p>

## Office Hours: A Valentine’s Day question about people in public life

date: 2024-02-14, from: Robert Reich on Substack

Friends, There&#8217;s so much hate and nastiness in public life these days &#8212; by &#8220;public life,&#8221; I mean anyone who is known to the broad public, including politicians, celebrities, athletes, actors, writers, painters, and journalists &#8212; that it&#8217;s probably easy for you to come up with people in public life you detest. (My list would include Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Benjamin Netanyahu, Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, and Kari Lake, for example.)

## 2024-02-14 Oddµ bug maybe

date: 2024-02-14, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>2024-02-14 Oddµ bug maybe</h1>

<p>I had a site where an entire subdirectory was private. Nobody but the author could read or write those pages. I had configured Apache to require authentication for this subdirectory.</p>

<p>The config looked a bit like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;LocationMatch &quot;^/(edit|save|add|append|upload|drop|view/secret)/&quot;&gt;
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName &quot;Password Required&quot;
  AuthUserFile /home/oddmu/.htpasswd
  Require valid-user
&lt;/LocationMatch&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note the addition of <code>view/secret</code>.</p>

<p>But yesterday I realized that you can run a search in the root. Such a search includes all the pages in subdirectories, and so Oddmu served an extract of the pages in the &ldquo;secret&rdquo; subdirectory. Adding <code>|search/secret</code> to the <code>LocationMatch</code> doesn&rsquo;t help.</p>

<p>I had to decide whether to disable search all together, or disable the search of subdirectories, or add a new feature.</p>

<p>I added a new feature.</p>

<p>It is tied to an environment variable called <code>ODDMU_FILTER</code>. It matches the directory being searched and the directory where the search starts. If the directory doesn&rsquo;t match, the pages returned must also not match; if the directory does match, the pages returned must also match.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of three pages:</p>

<ul>
<li>/a</li>
<li>/public/b</li>
<li>/secret/c</li>
</ul>

<p>The environment variable is set: <code>ODDMU_FILTER=^secret/</code> – what happens now?</p>

<ul>
<li>If you search from the root (doesn&rsquo;t match the filter), then only pages a and b are searched (they also don&rsquo;t match the filter).</li>
<li>If you search from /public (doesn&rsquo;t match the filter), then only page b is searched  (also doesn&rsquo;t match the filter). This behaviour is unchanged from before. Searches start with the directory the user is looking at.</li>
<li>If you search from /secret (matches the filter), then only page c is searched (also matches the filter). This, too, is unchanged from before.</li>
</ul>

<p>Naturally, you still need to change to the web server config for the actual authentication to happen:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;LocationMatch &quot;^/(edit|save|add|append|upload|drop|view/secret|search/secret)/&quot;&gt;
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName &quot;Password Required&quot;
  AuthUserFile /home/oddmu/.htpasswd
  Require valid-user
&lt;/LocationMatch&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I hope I got it right! It&rsquo;s also documented in the <a href="oddmu/oddmu-apache.5">oddmu-apache(5)</a> man page.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Oddµ">#Oddµ</a></p>

## Mozilla downsizes as it refocuses on Firefox and AI

date: 2024-02-13, from: OS News

Specifically, Mozilla plans to scale back its investment in a number of products, including its VPN, Relay and, somewhat remarkably, its Online Footprint Scrubber, which launched only a week ago. Mozilla will also shut down Hubs, the 3D virtual world it launched back in 2018, and scale back its investment in its mozilla.social Mastodon instance. The layoffs will affect roughly 60 employees. Bloomberg previously reported the layoffs. Going forward, the company said in an internal memo, Mozilla will focus on bringing “trustworthy AI into Firefox.” To do so, it will bring together the teams that work on Pocket, Content and AI/Ml. ↫ Frederic Lardinois for TechCrunch I&#8217;d like to remind everyone that I&#8217;ve been warning the Linux world about the precarious, uncertain future of Firefox for years now. The single most important desktop Linux application is in a death spiral and entirely dependent on free Google money. Not a good base to work from. With today&#8217;s news, I only feel strengthened in my conviction that the major desktop projects in the Linux world need to come together in a serious manner to discuss the establishment of a browser project optimised for Linux. Pick an engine, let the GNOME and KDE developers build a native UI on top, and take matters into your own hands. If you can build the two best desktop environments in desktop computing today, you can build a first-class browser together. This is existential.

## Microsoft is bringing Copilot “AI” to Notepad for Windows 11

date: 2024-02-13, from: OS News

Microsoft plans to make Copilot AI inseparable from Windows. After releasing Copilot for Windows 11 and 10 and adding it to Microsoft apps, you can now use Copilot AI in Notepad to get simplified explanations. You can install the Notepad app update via the Microsoft Store to use this feature, but remember, it only works in Dev or Canary channels. Notepad version 11.2401.25.0 adds the “Explain with Copilot” option in its context menu. After highlighting a chunk of text (sentences, code snippets, etc), right-click and select the “Explain with Copilot” option. Or you can press the Ctrl + E shortcut to invoke this feature. ↫ Abhishek Mishra I wonder if you could replace this new, butchered Notepad with a an older, working copy.

## FreeBSD 15, 16 to end support for 32 bit platforms

date: 2024-02-13, from: OS News

FreeBSD is deprecating 32-bit platforms over the next couple of major releases. We anticipate FreeBSD 15.0 will not include the armv6, i386, and powerpc platforms, and FreeBSD 16.0 will not include armv7. Support for executing 32-bit binaries on 64-bit kernels will be retained through at least the lifetime of the stable/16 branch if not longer. (There is currently no plan to remove support for 32-bit binaries on 64-bit kernels.) ↫ John Baldwin on freebsd-announce I don&#8217;t think this is too egregious of a timeline, but there&#8217;s always someone with some weird edge case that gets bit hard by deprecations like these.

## Running UNIX on a Nintendo Entertainment System

date: 2024-02-13, from: OS News

Who wouldn’t want to run a UNIX-like operating system on their NES or Famicom? Although there’s arguably no practical reason for doing so, decrazyo has cobbled together a working port of Little Unix (LUnix), which was originally written for the Commodore 64 and 128 by Daniel Dallmann. The impetus for this project was initially curiosity, but when decrazyo saw that someone had already written a UNIX-like OS for the 6502 processor, it seemed apparent that the NES was too similar to the C64 to not port it. ↫ Maya Posch for Hackaday This is peak computing.

## Why EV Makers Had So Little to Say at the Super Bowl

date: 2024-02-13, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTQ1NjkxNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxNTk4NzM1Nn0.a8flebv228V47RlgeQZt6FG7TecDva-LYQzp6gGEWdk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">As a young figure skater twirls around the ice rink, we see the seat next to her father is conspicuously empty. She notices, too. But not to worry: After the performance, dad and daughter drive their Kia EV9 up to her grandparents’ house in the mountains. Dad strings Edison bulbs around the adjacent frozen pond and brings out a speaker, both powered by the battery in his electric car, so the girl can recreate her performance for an adoring grandfather who watches from the window.</p><p>Besides being a tearjerker, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDZHTAtWy7I" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kia’s Super Bowl commercial</a> this year introduced millions of Americans to one of <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-battery-ac-dc-bidirectional" target="_self">my favorite</a> electric vehicle features — tapping the battery for activities other than driving, such as leaving on climate control for your dog, providing backup electricity to one’s home, or running accessories from lights to power tools. However, while Sunday’s game did feature EV ads from Kia, BMW, and Volkswagen, the broadcast felt like the end of a mini-era, a time when automakers used the Super Bowl to sell Joe American on the idea that EVs are shiny and cool.</p><p>The age of EV Super Bowl ads started with Audi’s in 2019 and accelerated during the next year’s big game, when GM used LeBron James to hype the all-electric <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/395873/humer-ev-pickup-truck-specs-teaser/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">return</a> of the Hummer. That year, 2020, marked the first time ads for EVs <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/02/13/super-bowl-ev-electric-ads-gas-cars-chart" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">outnumbered</a> those for gas cars. Super Bowl hype for EVs peaked in 2022, when seven electric vehicle ads aired compared to just two for old-school combustion. General Motors concocted an evil plan to trot out <a href="https://www.ispot.tv/ad/bVwg/general-motors-super-bowl-2022-ev-erybody-in-ft-mike-myers-seth-green-mindy-sterling-t1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the cast of the Austin Powers</a> movies for an EV commercial. Even now-struggling <a href="https://www.ispot.tv/ad/bVg6/polestar-2022-super-bowl-none-of-that-t1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Polestar</a> bought an ad.</p><p>Although EVs cooled as an advertising trend last year, the Super Bowl still saw a high-profile <a href="https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x8i2t11" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">commercial</a> with Will Ferrell that jammed GM’s electric vehicles into Netflix shows like “Bridgerton” and “Squid Game.” But the message had flipped on its head. No more, <em>You want an electric car because they’re powerful and sexy.</em> Instead, the ad implied: <em>We’re putting EVs everywhere because they are ordinary — and inevitable</em>.</p><p>By this past Sunday, the idea of selling EVs to Americans as the next big thing in tech had, with the exception of Kia’s spot, withered. BMW’s Christopher Walken <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfB-glrgn5o" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">commercial</a> was, like <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2024/02/what-was-that-super-bowl-ad-even-selling/677435/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">too many</a> during the game, an extended celebrity cameo that had little to do with the product at hand (the electric BMW i5, in case you forgot. I had to look it up.) VW’s pitch for the ID.Buzz, its electric revival of the Volkswagen bus, was soaked in nostalgia instead of flashy promises of 21st century features. GM and Ford, in the midst of sales slumps and strategy regroups over how to sell electric cars, skipped the Super Bowl this year.</p><p>The slowdown of Super Bowl EV hype sure feels like an extension of the <a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/electic-vehicles-super-bowl-ads-kia-bmw/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">implied malaise</a> around the electric sector in 2024. <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/are-ev-sales-really-slowing-data" target="_self">As <em>Heatmap</em> has noted</a>, EV sales are not, in fact, in the kind of freefall some headlines would suggest. Even so, a variety of struggles such as lagging charging infrastructure and uncertain tax credits as an election year looms have the automakers on edge.</p><p>The mega-platform of the Super Bowl has provided the simplest way to see what the car companies want to say about themselves and their electric futures. Until this weekend, the game had been GM’s biggest platform for proclaiming its intention to make an aggressive push in electrification. Its conspicuous absence from the Chiefs’ victory over the 49ers mirrors its real-world reversal; the Detroit behemoth is <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/phevs-2024-plug-in-hybrids" target="_self">bringing back the plug-in hybrid</a> as it cools on full EVs. Because Detroit wasn’t quite sure what to say about this moment in the EV transition, it said nothing.</p><p>And so, as we enter a gap year of electric uncertainty, a lingering question is, How will EVs be marketed now? The first wave of EV hype from the legacy car companies sought to duplicate the success of Tesla. Car ads positioned the new electric offerings not as mobility for the eco-minded, like the original Nissan Leaf, but as desirable quasi-luxury vehicles with big touchscreens and lots of LEDs — a must-have gadget on wheels.</p><p>If the Super Bowl is any indication, that approach has fizzled. Premium electrics like the Lucid Air will be sold that way, yes. But when the next big phase of electrification takes off, it will likely be because of boring, affordable cars — <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/redwood-is-exactly-what-tesla-needs" target="_self">entry-level EVs</a> like what Ford and Tesla reportedly have in development, or a suite of similar crossovers that mirrors the gasoline vehicles Americans families buy in droves. (Kia is <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/hyundai-motor-group-kia-motors-ioniq-5-ev-6" target="_self">already doing this</a> successfully. Perhaps that’s why they’re the ones pushing a family-focused version of the “EVs are cool” narrative.)</p><p>Maybe the next phase of EV won’t be about the technology of tomorrow. Instead, it will be about the best car you can afford today.</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-02-13, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2020/11/26/uncleSam.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">If you're thinking it might be good if President Biden stepped aside for someone younger and nicer to look at, what you really want is President Biden to be younger and nicer looking, and of course he probably wouldn't mind that either. But, as Keith Olbermann spells out so well in his latest <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/garland-must-stop-hurs-plans-to-testify-to-house-gop-2-13-24/id1633301179?i=1000645128033">Countdown</a>, if he were to step aside that would basically concede the election to Trump. So if you think the old man is being silly and vain, well, he's being a lot smarter than you are, and btw, paying a huge price. If you live to be 81, I bet the last thing you want to do, after the life he's had, is to be in this position. We should get behind him, and tell him so, let him know we don't want anyone else, and we want him to be happy, healthy and know that the smart, good people of the US appreciate what he's doing for all of us.

## Broadcom VMware ends free VMware vSphere Hypervisor closing an era

date: 2024-02-13, from: OS News

Broadcom’s VMware division took a big step today, ending its free VMware vSphere Hypervisor. This is one of those announcements that we were expecting after we covered VMware End of Availability on Many VMware vSphere Editions and VMware Updates its EOA Plan Providing Guidance for Some Subscription Transition, but it is a big deal for many STH readers. It now sets VMware down the path of mainframes. ↫ Patrick Kennedy at ServeTheHome A massive blow for the homelab community.

## How to get the retro WordArt back in Microsoft Word

date: 2024-02-13, from: OS News

Graphic design is my passion so naturally I love the vintage, 1990s WordArt. This was a feature in Microsoft Word that allowed you to create timeless “3D” renderings of any text you wanted. It was perfection, but for some reason Microsoft overhauled the feature in the late 2000s, basically ruining it.  These are a soulless simulacrum of the WordArt of yore. The true WordArt remains, however, embedded deep in the code of Microsoft Word itself. But some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became myth. And for twenty years WordArt passed out of all knowledge.&#160; But it can be found again. ↫ Justin Pot at Popular Science I had no idea this stuff was still in there, but I guess it makes sense &#8211; people absolutely adored this stuff, and it was all over the place for a very long time. You would see it in restaurants, hotels, schools, stores, everywhere &#8211; from high-end, luxury places to bargain basements. Now that I think about it, I&#8217;m not at all surprised it&#8217;s still accessible.

## Children in Gaza: Why aren’t we stopping the deaths?

date: 2024-02-13, from: Robert Reich on Substack

Friends, Late last night, Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen gave a remarkable speech on the Senate floor, condemning the government of Benjamin Netanyahu for deliberately blocking aid to civilians in Gaza. Van Hollen said: &#8220;Kids in Gaza are now dying from the deliberate withholding of food. In addition to the horror of that news, one other thing is true: That is a war crime. It is a textbook war crime. And that makes those who orchestrate it war criminals. &#8230; Every one of them [officials at humanitarian relief organizations] has stated that their organizations have never experienced a humanitarian disaster as dire and terrible as the world is witnessing in Gaza.&#8221;

## CAP-X and COMP-X: how the Tandy Pocket Computers got a sucky Japanese assembler

date: 2024-02-13, from: OS News

I grew up primarily with the Commodore 64, where if you wanted to do anything really cool and useful, you had to do it in 6502 assembly language. Today I still write 6502 assembly, plus some Power ISA and even a little TMS9900. I like assembly languages and how in control of the CPU you feel writing in one. But you know what would make me not like an assembly language? One that was contrived and not actually the CPU it was running on. And you know what would make me like it even less? If it were kneecapped, convoluted and limited without even proper I/O facilities. ↫ Old Vintage Computing Research Everything you ever wanted to know about CAP-X and COMP-X.

## Get a Grip, New York. It’s Just Snow.

date: 2024-02-13, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTQ1NjE4NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcwODU3MjQ2MX0.J00IUf5i3hy94MuOT0jCuejiQ17PPcGHuoRMABLs91Y/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>
	It is a time-honored tradition for Americans who live north of the 39th parallel to mock cities like <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/28/AR2009012803398.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_36" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Washington, D.C.</a>, and <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/01/atlanta-snow-storm-102839/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Atlanta</a> when they shut down over a little bit of snow. It is with great regret, then, that I write now to tell you that New York City has fallen. No longer will it be acceptable for us to roll our eyes at Southerners <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/01/30/268720258/two-days-later-atlantans-can-retrieve-cars-abandoned-in-storm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">who abandon their cars</a> over a mere inch of snow; no, we in fact <em>deserve</em> to be razzed by New Englanders and Minnesotans, our former partners in razzing. New Yorkers have become, in effect, weak. We’ve forgotten how to <a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/why-is-winter-warm-climate-change" target="_self">winter</a>.
</p><p>
	Maybe it’s because it has been <a href="https://x.com/AWxNYC/status/1757405654686257522?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">745 days</a> since our last significant snowfall, or maybe it’s because, at some point, we started to lean into our designation as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/nyregion/climate-change-nyc.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“subtropical” climate</a>. But no — I won’t make excuses, either. Outside my window in western Queens, the sidewalks are slushy but navigable, the flakes are light, and the city has lost its mind.
</p><p>
	“<a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/weather/weather-stories/snow-storm-nyc-weather-forecast/5129420/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">‘Stay home,’ NYC mayor pleads</a>,” reads one illustrative headline, while <em>The New York Times</em> has at least <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/02/13/us/weather-snow-storm-nyc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">16 different reporters</a> assigned to its nor’easter live blog covering — what, exactly? The fact that “the Metropolitan Museum of Art <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/02/13/us/weather-snow-storm-nyc/e46d769b-0cd5-554d-9e34-e76140062930?smid=url-share" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">remained open</a> on Tuesday”? (At least we haven’t <em>all</em> lost our senses.) And while the white stuff was still coming down around midday, at the time of this writing, Central Park <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/snow-totals-nyc-new-jersey-how-many-inches/5132113/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had reported just 1.2 inches</a> of total accumulation — not even enough to make a proper snowball without scraping the ground bare beneath your glove.

	Meanwhile, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, channeling his inner <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2008/09/06/jim-cantore-storm-tracker-if-hes-in-town-you-shouldnt-be/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jim Cantore</a>, posted <a href="https://x.com/NYCMayor/status/1757420822287773827?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video from the frontlines of the storm</a>. Even he was forced to admit, however, that “the roads are not bad.” At home, kids robbed of a proper snow day <a href="https://twitter.com/voteshekar/status/1757395392126243197?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">struggled to connect</a> to their remote classrooms after the city preemptively closed schools on Monday, a whole 20 hours before the brunt of the storm even hit.
</p><p>
	As tempting as it is to blame meteorologists for overselling the nor’easter (another time-honored American tradition), that’s not what the problem is. More simply, New Yorkers have gotten soft. As recently as 2016, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2016/01/24/snowzilla-makes-history-from-northern-virginia-to-new-york/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Snowzilla</a> dumped 26.8 inches across the five boroughs, and my street went unplowed for days. There will be longtime New Yorkers who laugh at even that example, pointing to the 2006 storm — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_blizzard_of_2006" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">18 years ago to the day!</a> — that was a tenth of an inch deeper and set the standing city record.
</p><p>
	Ridiculous snowstorms are, in fact, part of what gives New York its grit. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/02/13/us/weather-snow-storm-nyc/d6feae1d-026f-57ee-a1f7-6778ec7d5614?smid=url-share" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">None of this</a> “<em>few are out on the [Prospect Park] loop in the snow</em>” nonsense. Back in 1920, the city deployed the Army’s Chemical Warfare Service <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/06/nyregion/thecity/snow-trumps-fire.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to use<em> flamethrowers</em></a> to melt the snowbanks. The Blizzard of 1888 was so severe that 200 New Yorkers died and you could reportedly walk across the East River from Brooklyn to Manhattan or, if you were less lucky, trip over a frozen horse:
</p><blockquote>One man suffered a gash on his forehead when he fell into a snow drift. The drift was soft and deep, but his head struck the leg of a dead horse buried there. For some time afterward, the man showed his friends the wound and boasted that he was the first person ever kicked by a dead horse. [<a href="https://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/The_Blizzard_of_1888;_the_Impact_of_this_Devastating_Storm_on_New_York_Transit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NYCSubway.org</a>]
</blockquote><p>
	Not everyone has forgotten what it means to be scrappy, though.The more I looked into it on Tuesday, the more I found New Yorkers reacting to the storm with refrains of “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/02/13/us/weather-snow-storm-nyc/815fafb5-5ee4-5a3b-8c15-3c6dac7c117f?smid=url-share" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this is nothing</a>” and “<a href="https://x.com/lillildichi/status/1757410128490307898?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lame</a>.” It’s not that we need frozen horse legs to feel like proper New Yorkers, but not having them certainly <a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/warm-winters-mental-health-depression" target="_self">isn’t making us any happier</a>. Having a real winter <a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/warm-winters-mental-health-depression" target="_self">is part of what makes the city, the City</a>. If we become the kind of people who get worked up over a few inches of snow, then we truly are no better than Washingtonians. <em>Shudder</em>.
</p><p>
	But getting wimpier about winter might also be out of our control. New York’s Department of Environmental Conservation <a href="https://dec.ny.gov/environmental-protection/climate-change/effects-impacts#:~:text=Snowfall%20in%20New%20York%20is,to%20a%20shorter%20snow%20season." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">says</a> that statewide, snowfall is “likely to decrease … due to warming global temperatures.” As we’re seeing already, our ability to handle a little snow will decrease right along with it. One day, there could even be New Yorkers who don’t know what it means to fatally misjudge the depth of a snow-crusted puddle at the corner of an intersection. <em>Then</em> who are we?
</p><p>
	All I’m saying is, we used to be a proper city. And if what’s outside my window is what passes for exciting weather in New York these days — now at <a href="https://x.com/nymetrowx/status/1757464729566482679?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the tail-end</a> of the storm, the snowfall is starting to turn to rain — then Boston, do your worst. We deserve it.

## Germany goes on defense

date: 2024-02-13, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Earlier this morning, the Senate approved a $95 billion aid package for Israel and Ukraine. Meanwhile, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz says Europe&#8217;s defense industries must switch toward arms productions. Manufacturers are struggling to meet demand for ammunition, as the war in Ukraine continues and fears of what another Donald Trump presidency could mean for U.S.-Europe security ties are renewed. Also: inflation lingers, and Airbnb adds yet another fee.</p>

This newsletter is almost four years old, and during that time we have chronicled again and again how research has shown how deeply frustrated many consumers are with news as it exists today. In the U.S., that’s especially true for conservatives who feel alienated by the mainstream media, and thus have abandoned local and national news sources in favor of Fox...

## Clouds Over The Mines

date: 2024-02-13, from: David Rosenthal's blog

In early December 2022 when I wrote skeptically about the economics of Bitcoin mining in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/12/foolish-lenders.html"><i>Foolish Lenders</i></a> the Bitcoin "price" was around $17K. It has now climbed 153% to around $43K and, below the fold, I am still posting skeptically about the economics of mining.<br />

The first clue that the future for miners is clouded comes in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-07/bitcoin-btc-price-outlook-clouded-by-falling-miner-reserves-before-halving"><i>Bitcoin Outlook Clouded by Falling Miner Reserves Ahead of April’s Halving</i></a> by Sidhartha Shukla and David Pan:<br />
<blockquote>
Bitcoin miners are getting a jump on an anticipated decline in revenue from the so-called halving in April, when the blockchain’s network protocol will reduce rewards for verifying transactions by half.<br />
<br />
Miner reserves — unsold Bitcoin held in digital wallets associated with the companies — have dropped by 8,400 tokens since the start of 2024 to 1.8 million, a level last seen in June 2021, according to data compiled by CryptoQuant. Analysts said the decrease indicates miners are selling tokens.
</blockquote>
The somewhat misleading graph of the miners HODL-ings actually shows only a 2% drop in the number of BTC from the peak in August 2022. But the "value" of those HODL-ings has risen 75% from $44.8B to $78.5B.
One way of looking at it is that the mining industry started August 2022 with 1.865M BTC and, in the 18 months since mined 821,250 BTC for a total of 2,686,250 but they now have only 1.825M BTC so they must have sold 861,250, or about 5% more than they mined.
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-07/bitcoin-btc-price-outlook-clouded-by-falling-miner-reserves-before-halving">Nevertheless</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
  “Miners have begun to sell more of their coins to bolster balance sheets and fund growth capex ahead of tougher times for margins when block rewards are halved in April,” said Matthew Sigel, head of digital-asset research at VanEck. “After the halving, scale will matter even more.”
</blockquote>
Before the great EFT pump, it was generally believed that the frantic efforts to pump BTC over $30K suggested that the mining industry's break-even point was around $30K. On 6<sup>th</sup> October BTC was $26K and the hash rate was around 412M TH/s. Lets assume that the industry was breaking even at BTC=$30K and a hash rate of 412MTH/s, so the industry's costs were covered by 45K BTC/month or $1.35B/month. Assuming the increase in efficiency is roughly cancelled by less efficient operators entering, the hash rate is now 527 TH/s and so costs are around $1.73B. But income is around $1.94B/month so margins are around 12%.<br />
<br />
After the halvening, income is 22.5K BTC/month. At BTC=$43K, this is $968K/month or 56% of current costs. To maintain a 12% margin, costs need to be cut to $852K/month, or 49% of current costs. Alternatively, if costs stay the same, the Bitcoin "price" needs to increase to $86 in April.<br />
<br />
The industry isn't going to halve its costs in the next three months, and even massive printing of unbacked Tether isn't going to double the BTC "price", so "tougher times for margins"  are certainly among the clouds overhead.<br />

I am not the only skeptic. Short-seller J Capital Research investigated Hut 8, a large public miner, and on January 18<sup>th</sup> published <a href="https://www.jcapitalresearch.com/uploads/2/0/0/3/20032477/2024_01_18_hut.pdf"><i>The Coming HUT Pump and Dump</i></a>. As the chart shows, it was effective. The report featured a list of 22 different red flags, focused mainly on the recent merger between Hut 8 (HUT) and U.S. Bitcoin Corp. (USBTC) and asking:<br />
<blockquote>
Why then did HUT pay $745 mln to acquire this company and its planned payments?
</blockquote>
This is a good question, given <a href="https://www.jcapitalresearch.com/uploads/2/0/0/3/20032477/2024_01_18_hut.pdf">that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
One person highly familiar with USBTC told us, “without the merger, [USBTC] would have done a structured bankruptcy.”
</blockquote>
It wasn't as if Hut 8 didn't have <a href="https://www.jcapitalresearch.com/uploads/2/0/0/3/20032477/2024_01_18_hut.pdf">problems of its own</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Hut 8’s North Bay mining facility has been non-operational for an extended period of time, and problems at its Drumheller facility “have been causing miners to fail.”
</blockquote>
And the result of the merger is a <a href="https://www.jcapitalresearch.com/uploads/2/0/0/3/20032477/2024_01_18_hut.pdf">company that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
has an industry-low efficiency rate and, post halving, will produce Bitcoin at a loss of close to $20,000 per Bitcoin at current spot prices.
</blockquote>
In other words, the merged company can barely make money now and cannot survive when the industry's income is halved in less than 3 months. This all looks like rats leaving the sinking ship with whatever they can carry. An impression reinforced by David Pan in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-07/bitcoin-miner-hut-8-hut-ceo-exits-three-weeks-after-short-seller-allegations"><i>Bitcoin Miner Hut 8 CEO Exits Three Weeks After Short-Seller Allegations </i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Hut 8 Corp., one of the largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining companies, named Asher Genoot to succeed Jaime Leverton as chief executive officer, three weeks after a short-seller released a report critical of its recent merger.<br />
<br />
The transition is effective immediately. Genoot served as the chief operating officer and the president of US Bitcoin Corp. Miami-based US Bitcoin, which has large-scale mining facilities across the US including Texas, completed its merger with then-Canadian miner Hut 8 in late 2023.<br />
<br />
The leadership transition comes amid increasing competition among the miners, a Bitcoin code update set to drastically reduce mining revenue in two months as well as the Jan. 18 report from short-seller J Capital Research alleging the merged company was a “pump and dump” waiting to happen. Hut 8 has disputed the claim.
</blockquote>
Genoot has <a href="https://www.jcapitalresearch.com/uploads/2/0/0/3/20032477/2024_01_18_hut.pdf">allegedly</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
abandoned several failed start-ups.
</blockquote>
His co-founder was USBTC's CEO and is now HUT's CSO/director <a href="https://www.jcapitalresearch.com/uploads/2/0/0/3/20032477/2024_01_18_hut.pdf">and</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
is a 30-year-old used-car salesman from Vancouver whose history is littered with involvement in SEC-defined pump-and-dumps, sporting share-price declines of 83%,
</blockquote>
The key inputs for profitable mining are low-cost power and state-of-the-art chips to use it as effficently as possible. Clouds are gathering over both of them.<br />
<br />
As regards access to cheap electricity, utilities are increasingly reluctant to provide it. Take, for example, 
<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/canada/crypto-mining-company-loses-bid-to-force-bc-hydro-to-provide-power/ar-BB1hPaZE"><i>Crypto mining company loses bid to force BC Hydro to provide power
</i></a> by Darryl Greer of The Canadian Press:<br />
<blockquote>
A cryptocurrency firm has lost a bid to force BC Hydro to provide the vast amounts of power needed for its operations, upholding the provincial government's right to pause power connections for new crypto miners. <br />
<br />
Conifex Timber Inc., a forestry firm that branched out into cryptocurrency mining, had gone to the B.C. Supreme Court to have the policy declared invalid.<br />
<br />
But Justice Michael Tammen ruled Friday that the government's move in December 2022 to pause new connections for cryptocurrency mining for 18 months was "reasonable" and not "unduly discriminatory."<br />
<br />
BC Hydro CEO Christopher O'Riley had told the court in an affidavit that the data centres proposed by Conifex would have consumed 2.5 million megawatt-hours of electricity each year. 
</blockquote>
In the US, David Pan's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-01/bitcoin-miners-in-us-consume-up-to-2-3-of-nation-s-electricity"><i>US Bitcoin Miners Use as Much Electricity as Everyone in Utah </i></a> shows that regulators are starting to worry:<br />
<blockquote>
Bitcoin miners in the US are consuming the same amount of electricity as the entire state of Utah, among others, according to a new analysis by the US Energy Information Administration. And that’s considered the low end of the range of use.<br />
<br />
Electricity usage from mining operations represents 0.6% to 2.3% of all the country’s demand in 2023, according to the report released Thursday. It is the first time EIA has shared an estimate. The mining activity has generated mounting concerns from policymakers and electric grid planners about straining the grid during periods of peak demand, energy costs and energy-related carbon dioxide emissions.<br />
<br />
“This estimate of U.S. electricity demand supporting cryptocurrency mining would equal annual demand ranging from more than three million to more than six million homes,” the report said.
</blockquote>
Globally, this increase in demand is part of a bigger picture that is concerning, as Eamon Farhat reports in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-24/cryptocurrency-ai-electricity-demand-seen-doubling-in-three-years"><i>Electricity Demand at Data Centers Seen Doubling in Three Years</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Global electricity demand from data centers, cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence could more than double over the next three years, adding the equivalent of Germany’s entire power needs, the International Energy Agency forecasts in its latest report.<br />
<br />
There are more than 8,000 data centers globally, with about 33% in the US, 16% in Europe and close to 10% in China, with more planned. In Ireland, where data centers are developing rapidly, the IEA expects the sector to consume 32% of the country’s total electricity by 2026 compared to 17% in 2022. Ireland currently has 82 centers; 14 are under construction and 40 more are approved.<br />
<br />
Overall global electricity demand is expected to see a 3.4% increase until 2026, the report found. The increase, however, will be more than covered by renewables, such as wind, solar and hydro, and all-time high nuclear power.
</blockquote>
The first step towards stricter regulation is information collection which, as Kristoffer Tigue reports in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/02/large-cryptocurrency-miners-in-us-now-have-to-report-energy-use-to-government/"><i>Large cryptocurrency miners in US now have to report energy use to government</i></a> has started:<br />
<blockquote>
The Biden administration is now requiring some cryptocurrency producers to report their energy use following rising concerns that the growing industry could pose a threat to the nation’s electricity grids and exacerbate climate change.<br />
<br />
The Energy Information Administration announced last week that it would start collecting energy use data from more than 130 “identified commercial cryptocurrency miners” operating in the US. The survey, which started this week, aims to get a sense of how the industry’s energy demand is evolving and where in the country cryptocurrency operations are growing fastest.<br />
<br />
“As cryptocurrency mining has increased in the United States, concerns have grown about the energy-intensive nature of the business and its effects on the US electric power industry,” the EIA said in a new report, following the announcement. “Concerns expressed to EIA include strains to the electricity grid during periods of peak demand, the potential for higher electricity prices, as well as effects on energy-related carbon dioxide emissions.”

Turner Wright reports that <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-hash-rate-drops-freezing-texas"><i>Bitcoin hash rate drops by 34% amid freezing temperatures in Texas</i></a>:
<blockquote>
A sudden freeze in Texas may have contributed to a 34% drop in the Bitcoin hash rate, as some miners were forced to curtail operations amid demand on the state’s energy grid.<br />
<br />
Beginning on Jan. 14, temperatures in many parts of Texas dropped below freezing for one of the first times since a massive ice storm in February 2023. According to data from YCharts, the total Bitcoin network hash rate fell from more than 629 exahashes per second (EH/s) on Jan. 11 to roughly 415 EH/s on Jan. 15 — a 34% drop.

It isn't just that Texas has maybe a third of the industry, it is also that the US industry is growing much faster than anywhere else. Figures from Luxor Logistics show that in 2023 the US consumed <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-08/bitcoin-mining-why-ethiopia-is-attracting-chinese-crypto-miners">nearly two-thirds of all new mining rigs</a>. The figures come from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-08/bitcoin-mining-why-ethiopia-is-attracting-chinese-crypto-miners"><i>Chinese Bitcoin Miners Find a New Crypto Haven in Ethiopia</i></a> by David Pan and Fasika Tadesse:<br />
<blockquote>
Ethiopia has emerged as a rare opportunity for all firms that mine the original cryptocurrency, as climate change and power scarcity fuel a backlash against the $16 billion-a-year industry (at Bitcoin’s current price) elsewhere. But it holds special appeal for Chinese companies, which once dominated Bitcoin mining but have struggled to compete with local rivals in Texas, the current hub.<br />
</blockquote>
The haven isn't without its own <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-08/bitcoin-mining-why-ethiopia-is-attracting-chinese-crypto-miners">clouds</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
It is also a risky gamble, for the companies and Ethiopia alike. A succession of developing countries like Kazakhstan and Iran initially embraced Bitcoin mining, only to turn on the sector when its energy use threatened to fuel domestic discontent. China’s reign as the epicenter of Bitcoin mining came to an abrupt end in 2021, when the government banned it. Dozens of companies were forced to leave.<br />
<br />
Ethiopian officials are wary of the controversy that accompanies Bitcoin mining, according to industry executives who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing government relations. Even after new generation capacity came online, almost half the population live without access to electricity, making mining a delicate topic. At the same time, it represents a potentially lucrative source of foreign-exchange earnings.<br />
...<br />
The reliance on abundant power is also a major vulnerability because it can put miners in competition for electricity with factories and households, exposing them to political backlash.<br />
<br />
When Kazakzstan imposed fresh curbs and taxes on miners, “it basically killed the industry,” said Hashlabs co-founder Alen Makhmetov. Two years after the clampdown, his 10-megawatt facility there is still sitting idle.<br />
<br />
And in an era when rising temperatures wreak havoc around the world, Bitcoin mining is increasingly seen as a contributor to global warming that doesn’t serve any productive purpose — even though miners have claimed they’re increasingly tapping clean energy. A study by United Nations University published in October estimated that two-thirds of the electricity used for Bitcoin mining in 2020 and 2021 was generated using fossil fuels.
</blockquote>
Developing countries aren't the only ones where miners face "domestic discontent". <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/03/us/bitcoin-arkansas-noise-pollution.html"><i>Anxiety, Mood Swings and Sleepless Nights: Life Near a Bitcoin Mine</i></a> by Gabriel J.X. Dance reports on an example in Arkansas:<br />
<blockquote>
The Arkansas Data Centers Act, popularly called the Right to Mine law, offers Bitcoin miners legal protections from communities that may not want them operating nearby. Passed just eight days after it was introduced, the law was written in part by the Satoshi Action Fund, a nonprofit advocacy group based in Mississippi whose co-founder worked in the Trump administration rolling back Obama-era climate policies.
</blockquote>
The law <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/03/us/bitcoin-arkansas-noise-pollution.html">ins't popular</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
A furious backlash has some lawmakers considering a statewide ban.
</blockquote>
The Satoshi Action Fund <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/03/us/bitcoin-arkansas-noise-pollution.html">over-reached</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Despite efforts to build bipartisan support, the Satoshi fund has succeeded predominantly in red states. But in Arkansas, where the state legislature is dominated by Republicans, it is conservatives who have led calls to repeal the law, including Senator Bryan King, a poultry farmer whose district includes a property purchased by one of the companies tied to the Chinese government. He said it was not fair that the Bitcoin operators received special protections under the law, which shields them from “<a href="https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Home/FTPDocument?path=%2FACTS%2F2023R%2FPublic%2FACT851.pdf">discriminatory industry specific regulations and taxes</a>,” including noise ordinances and zoning restrictions.
</blockquote>
At least the Ethiopian mines don't emit much CO2, they run on <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-08/bitcoin-mining-why-ethiopia-is-attracting-chinese-crypto-miners">hydropower</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The opening of the GERD project increased Ethiopia’s installed generation capacity to 5.3 gigawatt, 92% of which comes from hydropower, a renewable energy source.<br />
<br />
Once GERD is fully completed, Ethiopia’s generation capacity will double, according to Ethiopian Electric Power. It charges Bitcoin miners a fixed rate of 3.14 US cents per kilowatt hour for electricity drawn from substations, Marketing and Business Development Director Hiwot Eshetu said in an interview.<br />
<br />
While that’s similar to the average in Texas, rates in the Lone Star State can swing wildly, Luxor’s Vera said, making profits there less predictable. In Ethiopia, the price will fall once miners connect directly to power plants, according to Hiwot.
</blockquote>
But if the utility can make money selling power to the mines right by the dam they have little incentive to build out the grid than could get the power to the unserved half of the population.<br />
<br />
As regards the longer-term issue of access to state-of-the-art chips, it is important to note that the best mining chips are sold by Bitmain, a Chinese company, but manufactured at TSMC in Taiwan. There are two major risks here. The first is that the US appears determined to prevent China <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/18/tech/us-china-chip-export-curbs-intl-hnk/index.html">importing leading-edge chips</a> and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/02/asml-halts-hi-tech-chip-making-exports-to-china-reportedly-after-us-request">equipment to make them</a>. China remains at least a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/china-close-to-shipping-5nm-chips-despite-western-curbs/">generation and a half</a> behind TSMC and Samsung, and reportedly has poor yields on its leading-edge process. These restrictions could well prevent Chinese mining companies acquiring leading-edge rigs, and might cause TSMC problems in fab-ing Bitmain products.<br />
<br />
Second, there is the looming threat of a Chinese blockade or even invasion of Taiwan. Of course, difficulties for Bitcoin miners are hardly the major impact if these threats are made good. One might think that, even if supplies of new mining chips were cut off, existing rigs would continue working. In the short term they would, but there is a long history of <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/05/generally-accepted-accounting-principles.html">rigs being obsolete</a> after <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.105901">about 18 months</a>. So they aren't designed or operated for longevity.<br />

WASHINGTON — Annual inflation in the United States cooled last month yet remained elevated in the latest sign that the pandemic-fueled price surge is gradually and fitfully coming under control. 


Tuesday's report from the Labor Department showed that the consumer price index rose 0.3% from December to January, up from a 0.2% increase the previous month. Compared with a year ago, prices are up 3.1%. 


That is less than the 3.4% figure in December and far below the 9.1% inflation peak in mid-2022. 


The latest reading is well above the Federal Reserve's 2% target at a time when public frustration with inflation has become a pivotal issue in President Joe Biden's bid for re-election. 


Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, so-called core prices climbed 0.4% last month, up from 0.3% in December and 3.9% over the past 12 months. Core inflation is watched especially closely because it typically provides a better read of where inflation is likely headed. The annual figure is the same as it was in December. 


Biden administration officials note that inflation has plummeted since pandemic-related supply disruptions and significant government aid sent it soaring three years ago. And a raft of forward-looking data suggests that inflation will continue to cool. 


Still, even as it nears the Fed's target level, many Americans remain exasperated that average prices are still about 19% higher than they were when Biden took office. 


The mixed data released Tuesday could reinforce the caution of Fed officials, who have said they're pleased with the progress in sharply reducing inflation but want to see further evidence before feeling confident that it's sustainably headed back to their 2% target. Most economists think the central bank will want to wait until May or June to begin cutting its benchmark rate from its 22-year-high of roughly 5.4. 


The Fed raised its key rate 11 times from March 2022 to July of last year in a concerted drive to defeat high inflation. The result has been much higher borrowing rates for businesses and consumers, including for mortgages and auto loans. Rate cuts, whenever they happen, would eventually lead to lower borrowing costs for many categories of loans. 


In the final three months of last year, the economy grew at an unexpectedly rapid 3.3% annual rate. There are signs that growth remains healthy so far in 2024. Businesses engaged in a burst of hiring last month. Surveys of manufacturing companies found that new orders rose in January. And services companies reported an uptick in sales.

This is what I imagine we all yearn for, for someone to really know us before we die. Okay if it can't be other people, at least let it be a machine. Something like preserving a brain. Wouldn't it be great to know that when you're gone, the essential you, even if it doesn't include your consciousness, persists? You could visit a person like you visit a website. This is just evolutionary, and it's obviously going to happen.

Today would be the perfect day to ski at Belleayre or Hunter, if you can get out of NYC where all the snow is falling. I have work to do and was planning on skiing tomorrow, expecting 8 inches of fresh snow. We're not getting much from this storm in the Catskills, NYC is getting the brunt. And any day you can't get here from the city means not many people on the mountain. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

## Pluralistic: Kelly Link's "Book of Love" (13 Feb 2023)

date: 2024-02-13, from: Cory Doctorow's blog

Today's links Kelly Link's "Book of Love": A deceptively quirky tale with rusty razors at its core. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading. Kelly Link's "Book of Love" (permalink) Kelly Link is one of science fiction's most important writers, a master of the short story to rank with the likes of Ted Chiang. For a decade, Kelly's friends have traded whispers that she was working on a novel &#8211; a giant novel &#8211; and the rumors were true and the novel is glorious and you will love it: https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/book-of-love-9781804548455/ https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/239722/the-book-of-love-by-kelly-link/ It's called The Book of Love and it's massive &#8211; 650 pages! It is glorious. It is tricky. If you've read Link's short stories (which honestly, you must read), you know her signature move: a bone-dry witty delivery, used to spin tales of deceptive whimsy and quirkiness, disarming you with daffiness while she sets the hook and yanks. That's the unmistakeable, inimitable texture of a Kelly Link story: deft literary brushstrokes, painting a picture so charming and silly that you don't even notice when she cuts you without mercy. Turns out that she can quite handily do this for hundreds of pages, and the effect only gets better when it's given space to unfold. Hard to tell you about this one without spoilers! But I'll tell you this much. It's a story about three teenaged friends who return from death and find themselves in the music room at their high school, face to face with their mild-mannered music teacher, Mr Anabin. Anabin explains what's happened in frustratingly cryptic &#8211; and very emphatic &#8211; terms, but is interrupted when a sinister shape-shifting wolf enters the music room. This is Bogomil, and whenever he speaks, Mr Anabin turns his back &#8211; and vice versa. Anabin and Bogomil appear to be rivals, and Bogomil may or may not have been the keeper of the land of the dead from which the three have escaped. There's also a forth, a tattered shade who's been dead so long they don't remember who they are or anything about themselves. Bogomil would like to take the four back to the deadlands, but Anabin proposes a contest and Bogomil agrees &#8211; but no one explains the contest or its rules (or even its stakes) to the four dead teenagers. That's the wind up. The pitch that follows is flawless, a long and twisting mystery about friendship, love, queerness, rock-and-roll, stardom, parenthood, loyalty, lust and duty. There's a terrifying elder god of Lovecraftian proportions. There are ghosts upon ghosts. There are ancient grudges. There are sudden revelations that come from unexpected angles but are, in retrospect, perfectly set up. More than anything, there are characters. It's impossible not to love Link's characters, despite (because of) their self-destructive choices and their impossible dilemmas. They are so sweet, but they are also by turns mean and spiteful and resentful, like the pinch of salt that transforms a caramel from inedible spun sugar into something that bites even as it delights. These characters, so very likable, are often dead or at death's door, and that peril propels the story like an unstoppable locomotive. From the very start, it's clear that some of them can't survive to the end, and Link is merciless in making you root for all of them, even though this means rooting against them all. This, in turn, creates moments of toe-curling, sublime horror. Link has built a complex machine with more moving parts than anyone has any business being able to keep track of. And yet, each of these parts meshes flawlessly with all the others. The book ends with such triumphant perfection that it lingers long after you put it down. I can't wait to read this one again.

## Everybody Is Mad About Biden’s Offshore Lease Plans

date: 2024-02-13, from: Heatmap News

<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> New York City is expecting six inches of snow • Intense flooding has been recorded across Oman • Parts of southeastern Australia are facing the worst bushfires in four years. </em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Oil industry and environmentalists are mad about Biden’s offshore lease plans </h3><p>
<strong></strong>The Biden administration’s decision to dramatically reduce the number of offshore drilling lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico is proving to be unpopular with the oil industry <em>and</em> environmentalists. The plan is to hold just three lease sales between 2025 and 2029, a record low and far below the 47 proposed during the Trump administration. This week both the American Petroleum Institute (the fossil fuel industry’s <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=43be28c71b&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">biggest</a> trade group) and Earthjustice (an environmental group) filed separate lawsuits over the plan “in a sign of the political tightrope policymakers must walk when rulemaking in the U.S. climate and energy sector,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=7564261d7a&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a> the <em>Financial Times.</em> The oil group wants more lease sales, and accused the government of forcing Americans to rely on foreign energy sources; Earthjustice wants fewer lease sales (or none at all) and said the administration was ignoring public health impacts for frontline communities. “The oil and gas industry is already sitting on 9mn acres of undeveloped leases. They certainly are not entitled to more,” said Brettny Hardy, an Earthjustice attorney.

<strong></strong>China’s leading carmakers and battery manufacturers are <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=d823f13fa3&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">joining forces</a> to turbocharge commercialization of solid-state electric vehicle batteries. The China All-Solid-State Battery Collaborative Innovation Platform (CASIP) includes six of the top 10 global battery makers, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=ef2872959a&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> Peter Johnson at <em>Electrek</em>, including would-be rivals BYD and CATL. Solid-state batteries are “a kind of holy-grail technology,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=32609529d3&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a> Patrick George at <em>Heatmap</em>. They can cut charging times and increase EV range compared to lithium-ion batteries, so carmakers are eager to bring a solid-state battery to market. But mass production is still very difficult. The Chinese project “pools academia and industry leaders,” Johnson said, and “could revolutionize the EV market.”

<strong></strong>Over the last three decades, Greenland has lost about <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=d2cc5c3591&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">11,000 square miles</a> of its ice cover due to global warming, according to a new <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=94e3785d06&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> published in <em>Scientific Reports</em>. The researchers, from the University of Leeds, analyzed high resolution satellite images to understand historical melting trends. They found that as the ice disappears, plants are spreading – the amount of land with some vegetation on it more than doubled in three decades. Greenland is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world. The melting ice creates a feedback loop – exposed rock absorbs more heat, therefore raising the temperature of the land. And the permafrost is melting, too, releasing carbon dioxide and methane.

</p><h3>4. China’s emissions could peak sooner than expected</h3><p>
<strong></strong>Experts think China’s greenhouse gas emissions will peak earlier than originally anticipated, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=c778fbbe4f&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> The turning point could even come this year. China is the biggest annual greenhouse gas emitter, but it is rapidly scaling up renewable energy. Just last year its solar power capacity increased by 55%, “more than 500 million solar panels and well above the total installed solar capacity of the U.S.,” the <em>Journal</em> report explained. And it installed more wind energy than the rest of the world combined. “An early peak would have a lot of symbolic value and send a signal to the world that we’ve turned a corner,” said Jan Ivar Korsbakken, a senior researcher at the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research.

	Two climate scientists have sparked debate in their field by <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=1e45a87676&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suggesting</a> the Saffir-Simpson Wind Scale, which is used to determine a hurricane’s category, is insufficient in describing the risks posed by stronger storms in the age of climate change. The scale currently goes from 1 to 5, but Michael Wehner of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and James Kossin of the First Street Foundation pondered whether a Category 6 was needed. This was more than a week ago, and the debate is still going. The main objection from other climate experts is that adding a new category “increases the chance of people underestimating the risks from storms that are lower than the highest category,” ABC News <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=6bc27c77aa&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a>. After all, the category only focuses on wind speed and doesn’t tell residents much about other deadly hazards like storm surge and rainfall, which account for most storm-related deaths. “It is not evident how having an additional category on the Saffir-Simpson wind scale would improve preparation or decisions,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=c81c7edd18&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> AccuWeather chief meteorologist Jon Porter.

## Molly White Reviews Blockchain Book

date: 2024-02-13, updated: 2024-02-12, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Molly White&#8212;of &#8220;<a href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/">Web3 is Going Just Great</a>&#8221; fame&#8212;<a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/review-read-write-own-by-chris-dixon/">reviews</a> Chris Dixon&#8217;s blockchain solutions book: <a href="https://readwriteown.com/"><i>Read Write Own</i></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In fact, throughout the entire book, Dixon fails to identify a <em>single</em> blockchain project that has successfully provided a non-speculative service at any kind of scale. The closest he ever comes is when he speaks of how &#8220;for decades, technologists have dreamed of building a grassroots internet access provider&#8221;. He describes one project that &#8220;got further than anyone else&#8221;: Helium. He&#8217;s right, as long as you ignore the fact that Helium was providing LoRaWAN, not Internet, that by the time he was writing his book Helium hotspots had long since passed the phase where they might generate even enough tokens for their operators to merely break even, and that the network was pulling in somewhere around $1,150 in usage fees a month despite the company being valued at $1.2 billion. Oh, and that the company had widely lied to the public about its supposed big-name clients, and that its executives have been accused of hoarding the project&#8217;s token to enrich themselves. But hey, a16z sunk millions into Helium (a fact Dixon never mentions), so might as well try to drum up some new interest!...</p></blockquote>

## Stormy Times Ahead

date: 2024-02-13, from: Dan Rather's Steady

I noticed Donald Trump will spend more time in front of a judge this week than in front of potential voters. It&#8217;s his new normal. Trump&#8217;s schedule looks like a litigious hellscape. And his calendar for the foreseeable future is more of the same. It&#8217;s all so antithetical to my belief about what kind of person should lead our great nation.

## On climbing and design

date: 2024-02-13, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>I don’t climb, I am not a climber, I don’t have interest in becoming one. I do happen to have a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ivanmoreale/">brother</a> though. And he’s a climber. And if you know anything about climbers is that they’re a bit obsessed with the sport. And as a result of that I’m becoming a climber by proximity. I have absolutely no intention of practicing the sport but I do enjoy watching it as a sport and I also enjoy consuming content related to it. Mainly because climbers climb in gorgeous places and I love nature. Anyway my brother also happens to be a graphic designer and it was only a matter of time before the two things collided. Well, it finally happened: <a href="https://621.design">621.design</a></p>
<figure class="m-o" data-template="with"><div class="m-m"><img class="img" loading="lazy" src="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/on-climbing-and-design/c7954b39fd-1707814510/621.jpg" style="aspect-ratio:1000 / 1333"></div></figure>
<p>The first series of climbing inspired t-shirts are available to be purchased after WAY TOO LONG! I’m already tired of hearing about this project but I’m happy that they’re finally out in the wild. Just to be clear, I am not involved with this. I’m just doing my part and let you know that these exist because who knows, maybe some of you out there are into climbing.</p>
<p>Now, I do have one of those T-shirts sitting on my desk this very moment. It’s the <a href="https://621.design/products/climb">Climb</a>, size L. If you want it, you can sign up to my <a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale">One a Month</a> and then send me a message. I’m gonna send it to the first one who claims it and will throw in something else at random in the package. No drugs I promise you. I might add a book in there or maybe a stick from the woods. Still don’t know but there’s going to be something.</p>
<p>Anyway, <a href="https://621.design">621.design</a>, also on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/621.design/">Instagram </a>. Go tell my brother that these took WAY TOO LONG to come out.</p>

<p>Not really pleased with how today&rsquo;s scene is going. I feel like I had good ideas for it two weeks ago, but I didn&rsquo;t write it then, because I still hadn&rsquo;t finished the previous scenes 😖 Now I&rsquo;m scrambling a bit – &ldquo;Oh, this bit of dialogue was in it, right?&rdquo; and it just doesn&rsquo;t feel cohesive. In future I need to take notes, no matter how much I think I&rsquo;m &ldquo;just about&rdquo; to reach a scene, anyway.</p>

## Saving all your GitHub Stars to Pinboard

date: 2024-02-13, from: Conor O'Niell's blog, Cross Dominant

Over the past 18 months or so, I&rsquo;ve been replacing various IFTTT and Low-Code functions with my own code running either in GitHub Actions or AWS Lambda. The latest one is a simple function to save all my latest GitHub Stars to Pinboard once an hour.
This way, no matter what IFTTT/Zapier/etc decide to change this month, I don&rsquo;t have to change anything. Some of my Serverless functions have been running for years with no updates required.

Today&#8217;s big story continues to be Trump&#8217;s statement that he &#8220;would encourage [Russia] to do whatever the hell they want&#8221; to countries that are part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) if those countries are, in his words, &#8220;delinquent.&#8221; Both Democrats and Republicans have stood firm behind NATO since Dwight D. Eisenhower ran for president in 1952 to put down the isolationist wing of the Republican Party, and won.

## Biden Forms Task Force to Address Mishandling of Classified Documents During Presidential Transitions

date: 2024-02-13, from: VOA News USA

washington — President Joe Biden on Monday launched a task force aimed at addressing the "systemic" problem of mishandling classified information during presidential transitions, days after a Justice Department special counsel’s sharply critical report said he had done just that.


The Presidential Records Transition Task Force will study past transitions to determine best practices for safeguarding classified information from an outgoing administration, the White House said. It will also assess the need for changes to existing policies and procedures to prevent the removal of sensitive information that by law should be kept with the National Archives and Records Administration.


The report from special counsel Robert Hur listed dozens of sensitive documents found at Biden's home in Wilmington, Delaware, and at his former Washington office. The papers were marked as classified or later assessed to contain classified information.


The majority of the documents, Hur's report stated, appeared to have been mistakenly removed from government offices, though he also detailed some items that Biden appeared to knowingly retain. He concluded that criminal charges were not warranted in the matter.


“I take responsibility for not having seen exactly what my staff was doing,” Biden said last week after Hur's report was released. He added that “things that appeared in my garage, things that came out of my home, things that were moved were moved not by me but my staff.”


First findings


Biden aides first discovered some of the documents as they cleared out the offices of the Penn-Biden Center in Washington in 2022, and more were discovered during subsequent searches by Biden's lawyers and the FBI.


Biden promptly reported the discoveries to federal authorities, which prompted the special counsel probe. By contrast, former President Donald Trump is accused of resisting efforts to return classified government records that he moved to his Florida residence before leaving office in 2021 and of obstructing the investigation into them in a separate special counsel investigation.




In even the best of circumstances, presidential transitions can be chaotic as records of the outgoing administration are transferred to the National Archives and thousands of political appointees leave their jobs to make way for the incoming administration.


Officials of multiple administrations have said there is a systemic problem with mishandling of classified information by senior government officials, particularly around transitions, magnified by rampant overclassification across the government.


Former Vice President Mike Pence turned over some classified documents discovered at his home last year. And several times a year, former officials from all levels of government discover they possess classified material and turn it over to the authorities.


“Previous presidential transitions, across administrations stretching back decades, have fallen short in ensuring that classified presidential records are properly archived at NARA,” the White House said. “In light of the many instances that have come to light in recent years revealing the extent of this systemic issue, President Biden is taking action to strengthen how administrations safeguard classified documents during presidential transitions and to help address this long-standing problem going forward.”


Hur’s report said many of the documents recovered at the Penn Biden Center in Washington, in parts of Biden’s Delaware home and in his Senate papers at the University of Delaware were retained by “mistake.”


Subjects of documents


Biden could not have been prosecuted as a sitting president, but Hur’s report states that he would not recommend charges against Biden regardless. Investigators did find evidence of willful retention of a subset of records found in Biden’s Wilmington, Delaware, house, including in a garage, office and basement den, but not enough to suggest charges. The files pertain to a troop surge in Afghanistan during the Obama administration that Biden had vigorously opposed. He kept records that documented his position, including a classified letter to Obama during the 2009 Thanksgiving holiday.


Biden also retained his personal notebooks after leaving the vice presidency, some of which investigators found contained classified information, though other officials have kept similar documents as their personal property.


“President Biden takes classified information seriously – he returned the documents that were found, he fully cooperated with the investigation, and it concluded that there was no case," said Ian Sams, a spokesperson for the White House counsel's office. "Now he is taking action to help strengthen future transitions to better prevent classified documents from being accidentally packed up and removed from the government, like we have seen with officials from every administration for decades.”


The task force will be led by Katy Kale, deputy administrator of the General Services Administration, who was assistant to the president for management and administration during the Obama administration, the post that oversees the human resources and document retention functions at the White House.


The panel will include representatives from the White House, General Services Administration, NARA, the National Security Council and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.


The task force is to produce its recommendations ahead of the next presidential transition. It is set to operate independently from the White House Transition Coordinating Council, which is chaired by the White House chief of staff and required by law to be stood up six months before any presidential election.

## Ed Pentz accepts the 2024 NISO Miles Conrad Award

date: 2024-02-13, from: Crossref Blog

<p>Great news to share: our Executive Director, Ed Pentz, has been selected as the 2024 recipient of the Miles Conrad Award from the USA&rsquo;s National Information Standards Organization (NISO). The award is testament to an individual&rsquo;s lifetime contribution to the information community, and we couldn&rsquo;t be more delighted that Ed was voted to be this year&rsquo;s well-deserved recipient.</p>
<div class="shortcode-divwrap align-right">
<span><figure><img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/staff/ed17-720px.png" width="100%"/>
</figure>
</span>
</div>
<p>During the <a href="https://niso.plus" target="_blank">NISO Plus conference</a> this week in Baltimore, USA, Ed accepted his award and delivered the 2024 Miles Conrad lecture, reflecting on how far open scholarly infrastructure has come, and the part he has played in this at Crossref and through numerous other collaborative initiatives.</p>
<p>Established in 1965, the Miles Conrad Award gives recognition to those who&rsquo;ve made substantial contributions to the information community over a lifetime. Named after the founder of the National Federation of Abstracting and Indexing Services (NFAIS)—an association that since merged with NISO—the award encourages innovation in content management and dissemination. Over the years, leaders and innovators who have significantly influenced the field of information exchange have been honored with the award. Ed has joined <a href="https://www.niso.org/awards/MCA" target="_blank">an illustrious group</a>!</p>
<p>Ed’s leadership in collaboration and diplomacy has led to Crossref&rsquo;s success in making research objects more accessible and useful to a wide global audience, including publishers, researchers, funders, societies, libraries, and more. Crossref&rsquo;s founding purpose is stated as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“To promote the development and cooperative use of new and innovative technologies to speed and facilitate scientific and other scholarly research”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Acknowledging his privilege as a Western, university-educated, white man, which he comments has helped his career, Ed prioritises collaboration, open communication, teamwork, and equity in creating a positive, trusted environment that has brought together a diverse team of 49 colleagues from 11 countries. The organisation’s culture allows everyone to grow and contribute to the mission of a connected <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus">research nexus</a> by including and developing solutions for community members across the globe.</p>
<p>Before his journey with Crossref, Ed held a number of roles at Harcourt Brace, including launching Academic Press&rsquo;s first online journal. This experience led to his involvement with the DOI-X pilot project, which became the foundation for Crossref. Since its launch in 2000, under his leadership, Crossref has become an important component of the research ecosystem, an open scholarly infrastructure with nearly 20,000 members across more than 150 countries. Crossref is now the main source of &gt;155 million records about all kinds of research objects and this open metadata registry is relied upon by thousands of tools and services across the whole research system.</p>
<p>Ed’s influence is also evident throughout the wider world of open scholarly infrastructure; aside from establishing Crossref, he co-founded <a href="https://ror.org/" target="_blank">ROR</a> and was a founding member of <a href="https://orcid.org/" target="_blank">ORCID</a>, where he also served as board Chair. Further, he has engaged with the community by holding various advisory positions, including the <a href="https://www.doi.org/" target="_blank">DOI Foundation</a>, the Digital Object Naming Authority (DONA), and the Coalition for Diversity in Scholarly Publishing (C4DISC).</p>
<p>Ed also emphasised that the long-term success of community initiatives lies in patience and the ability to agree on high-level principles of purpose and governance, which oil the wheels of collaboration, encourage participation, and enable more progressive change that builds and lasts over time. He says, &ldquo;to solve collective problems it takes collaboration and diplomacy, bringing together a group of stakeholders, balancing their different concerns, building trust, and reaching consensus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The adoption of the <a href="https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org" target="_blank">Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure (POSI)</a>, along with (so far) 14 other organisations, was a key <a href="https://www.crossref.org/categories/posi/">turning point for Crossref</a>, Ed said, and one which has already paved the way for more openness of key metadata for the community, including references and retractions, as well as closer partnerships with many of the other POSI adoptees, given their shared understanding and experience.</p>
<p>Referencing the current &ldquo;peak hype&rdquo; around artificial intelligence (AI), Ed points to the challenge of research integrity and the &ldquo;growing field of science sleuthing&rdquo; as a forthcoming area that Crossref and open metadata may help tackle at scale, including through Crossref&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.crossref.org/categories/research-integrity">Integrity of the Scholarly Record (ISR) Program</a> and&mdash;of course&mdash;community-wide collaboration.</p>
<p>In concluding his talk, Ed describes his hopes and dreams for scholarly communications in the future. He would like to see more balance in diversity in the leadership of open scholarly infrastructure, extended integrations among the various foundational infrastructures, and a fully connected system where the scholarly record is inclusive globally.</p>
