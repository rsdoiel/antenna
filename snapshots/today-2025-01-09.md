## The Seven-Action Documentation model

date: 2025-01-09, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

<p>I think all technical writers, at some point or another, feel the urge to base their work on something more systematic than “it’s just the way folks documented stuff since forever”. Toolkits and frameworks provide content types, which is immensely valuable when you <em>know</em> what you want to write, but <em>starting</em> from there is like buying a hammer without knowing that half of the work you’ll do is turning screws. As I find the lack of deeper conversation around this topic rather unsettling, I decided to contribute some verses.</p>

## microsoft/phi-4

date: 2025-01-08, updated: 2025-01-08, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-4">microsoft/phi-4</a></strong></p>
Here's the official release of Microsoft's Phi-4 LLM, now officially under an MIT license.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I covered the earlier <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/15/phi-4-technical-report/">unofficial versions</a>, where I talked about how the model used synthetic training data in some really interesting ways.</p>
<p>It benchmarks favorably compared to GPT-4o, suggesting this is yet another example of a GPT-4 class model <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/31/llms-in-2024/#some-of-those-gpt-4-models-run-on-my-laptop">that can run on a good laptop</a>.</p>
<p>The model already has several available community quantizations. I ran the <a href="https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/phi-4-4bit">mlx-community/phi-4-4bit</a> one (a 7.7GB download) using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/mlx-llm/">mlx-llm</a> like this:</p>
<pre><code>uv run --with 'numpy&lt;2' --with mlx-lm python -c '
from mlx_lm import load, generate

model, tokenizer = load("mlx-community/phi-4-4bit")

prompt = "Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle"

if tokenizer.chat_template is not None:
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    prompt = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
        messages, add_generation_prompt=True
    )

response = generate(model, tokenizer, prompt=prompt, verbose=True, max_tokens=2048)
print(response)'
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/f58e464dd653e1c637cf42d18416344d">Here's what I got back</a>.</p>
<p><img style="width: 80%" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/phi4-pelican.svg" alt="Hardly recognizable pelican on a bicycle"></p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> The model is now available <a href="https://ollama.com/library/phi4">via Ollama</a>, so you can fetch a 9.1GB model file using <code>ollama run phi4</code>, after which it becomes available via the <a href="https://github.com/taketwo/llm-ollama">llm-ollama</a> plugin.

## CSS Wish List 2025

date: 2025-01-08, from: Eric Meyer blog

Back in 2023, I belatedly jumped on the bandwagon of people posting their CSS wish lists for the coming year.  This year I’m doing all that again, less belatedly! (I didn’t do it last year because I couldn’t even.  Get it?) I started this post by looking at what I wished for a couple of [&#8230;]

## Why are my live regions not working?

date: 2025-01-08, updated: 2025-01-08, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://tetralogical.com/blog/2024/05/01/why-are-my-live-regions-not-working/">Why are my live regions not working?</a></strong></p>
Useful article to help understand <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions">ARIA live regions</a>. Short version: you can add a live region to your page like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div id="notification" aria-live="assertive"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Then any time you use JavaScript to modify the text content in that element it will be announced straight away by any screen readers - that's the "assertive" part. Using "polite" instead will cause the notification to be queued up for when the user is idle instead.</p>
<p>There are quite a few catches. Most notably, the contents of an <code>aria-live</code> region will usually NOT be spoken out loud when the page first loads, or when that element is added to the DOM. You need to ensure the element is available and <em>not hidden</em> before updating it for the effect to work reliably across different screen readers.</p>
<p>I got Claude Artifacts <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/50946b742ef5da7d0435c341b2d6fa8b">to help me</a> build a demo for this, which is now available at <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/aria-live-regions">tools.simonwillison.net/aria-live-regions</a>. The demo includes instructions for turning VoiceOver on and off on both iOS and macOS to help try that out.
