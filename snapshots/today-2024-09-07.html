id="family-demands-independent-probe-into-israeli-military-killing-of-american">Family
demands independent probe into ‘Israeli military’ killing of
American</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Jerusalem — The family of a Turkish-American woman shot dead while
demonstrating against Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank
demanded an independent investigation into her death on Saturday,
accusing the Israeli military of killing her “violently.”</p>
<p>Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, 26, was “shot in the head” while participating in
a demonstration in Beita in the West Bank on Friday.</p>
<p>“Her presence in our lives was taken needlessly, unlawfully, and
violently by the Israeli military,” Eygi’s family said in a
statement.</p>
<p>“A U.S. citizen, Aysenur was peacefully standing for justice when she
was killed by a bullet that video shows came from an Israeli military
shooter.</p>
<p>“We call on President (Joe) Biden, Vice President (Kamala) Harris,
and Secretary of State (Antony) Blinken to order an independent
investigation into the unlawful killing of a U.S. citizen and to ensure
full accountability for the guilty parties.”</p>
<p>The Israeli military said its forces “responded with fire toward a
main instigator of violent activity who hurled rocks at the forces and
posed a threat to them” during the protest.</p>
<p>Eygi was a member of the International Solidarity Movement (ISM), a
pro-Palestinian organization, and was in Beita on Friday for a weekly
demonstration against Israeli settlements, according to ISM.</p>
<p>In recent years, pro-Palestinian demonstrators have frequently held
weekly protests against the Eviatar settlement outpost overlooking
Beita, which is backed by far-right Israeli ministers.</p>
<p>During Friday’s protest, Eygi was shot in the head, according to the
U.N. rights office and Rafidia hospital where she was pronounced
dead.</p>
<p>Turkey said she was killed by “Israeli occupation soldiers,” with
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemning the Israeli action as
“barbaric.”</p>
<p>Washington called it a “tragic” event and has pressed its close ally
Israel to investigate.</p>
<p>But her family has demanded an independent probe.</p>
<p>“Given the circumstances of Aysenur’s killing, an Israeli
investigation is not adequate,” her family said.</p>
<p>Her family said Eygi always advocated “an end to the violence against
the people of Palestine.”</p>
<p>Israeli settlements in the West Bank, where about 490,000 people
live, are illegal under international law.</p>
<p>Since Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel which triggered the war in
Gaza, Israeli troops or settlers have killed more than 690 Palestinians
in the West Bank, according to the Palestinian health ministry.</p>
<p>At least 23 Israelis, including security forces, have been killed in
Palestinian attacks during the same period, according to Israeli
officials.</p>

id="boeings-beleaguered-starliner-returns-home-without-astronauts">Boeing’s
beleaguered Starliner returns home without astronauts</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Boeing’s beleaguered Starliner made its long-awaited
return to Earth on Saturday without the astronauts who rode it up to the
International Space Station, after NASA ruled the trip back too
risky.</p>
<p>After years of delays, Starliner launched in June for what was meant
to be a roughly weeklong test mission — a final shakedown before it
could be certified to rotate crew to and from the orbital
laboratory.</p>
<p>But unexpected thruster malfunctions and helium leaks en route to the
ISS derailed those plans, and NASA ultimately decided it was safer to
bring crewmates Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams back on a rival SpaceX
Crew Dragon — though they’ll have to wait until February 2025.</p>
<p>The gumdrop-shaped Boeing capsule touched down softly at the White
Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico, its descent slowed by parachutes and
cushioned by airbags, having departed the ISS around six hours
earlier.</p>
<p>As it streaked red-hot across the night sky, ground teams reported
hearing sonic booms. The spacecraft endured temperatures of 1,650
degrees Celsius during atmospheric reentry.</p>
<p>NASA lavished praise on Boeing during a post-flight press conference
where representatives from the company were conspicuously absent.</p>
<p>“It was a bullseye landing,” said Steve Stich, program manager for
NASA’s commercial crew program. “The entry in particular has been darn
near flawless.”</p>
<p>Still, he acknowledged that certain new issues had come to light,
including the failure of a new thruster and the temporary loss of the
guidance system.</p>
<p>He added it was too early to talk about whether Starliner’s next
flight, scheduled for August next year, would be crewed, instead
stressing NASA needed time to analyze the data they had gathered and
assess what changes were required to both the design of the ship and the
way it is flown.</p>
<p>Ahead of the return leg, Boeing carried out extensive ground testing
to address the technical hitches encountered during Starliner’s ascent,
then promised — both publicly and behind closed doors — that it could
safely bring the astronauts home. In the end, NASA disagreed.</p>
<p>Asked whether he stood by that decision, NASA’s Stich said: “It’s
always hard to have that retrospective look. We made the decision to
have an uncrewed flight based on what we knew at the time and based on
our knowledge of the thrusters and based on the modeling that we
had.”</p>
<p>History of setbacks</p>
<p>Even without crew aboard, the stakes were high for Boeing, a
century-old aerospace giant.</p>
<p>With its reputation already battered by safety concerns surrounding
its commercial jets, its long-term prospects for crewed space missions
hung in the balance.</p>
<p>Shortly after undocking, Starliner executed a powerful “breakout
burn” to swiftly clear it from the station and prevent any risk of
collision — a maneuver that would have been unnecessary if crew were
aboard to take manual control if needed.</p>
<p>Mission teams then conducted thorough checks of the thrusters
required for the critical “deorbit burn” that guided the capsule onto
its reentry path around 40 minutes before touchdown.</p>
<p>Though it was widely expected that Starliner would stick the landing,
as it had on two previous uncrewed tests, Boeing’s program continues to
languish behind schedule.</p>
<p>In 2014, NASA awarded both Boeing and SpaceX multibillion-dollar
contracts to develop spacecraft to taxi astronauts to and from the ISS,
after the end of the Space Shuttle program left the US space agency
reliant on Russian rockets.</p>
<p>Although initially considered the underdog, Elon Musk’s SpaceX surged
ahead of Boeing, and has successfully flown dozens of astronauts since
2020.</p>
<p>The Starliner program, meanwhile, has faced numerous setbacks – from
a software glitch that prevented the capsule from rendezvousing with the
ISS during its first uncrewed test flight in 2019, to the discovery of
flammable tape in the cabin after its second test in 2022, to the
current troubles.</p>
<p>With the ISS scheduled to be decommissioned in 2030, the longer
Starliner takes to become fully operational, the less time it will have
to prove its worth.</p>

id="republican-bill-to-avoid-government-shutdown-requires-proof-of-citizenship-to-vote">Republican
bill to avoid government shutdown requires proof of citizenship to
vote</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — House Republicans unveiled on Friday their legislation
to avoid a partial government shutdown at the end of the month and fund
the government into late March, when a new president and Congress would
make the final decision on agency spending and priorities for fiscal
2025.</p>
<p>Republicans also added a hot-button immigration issue to the measure
by requiring states to obtain proof of citizenship, such as a birth
certificate or passport, when someone registers to vote. Inclusion of
the citizenship requirement is a nonstarter in the Senate, complicating
prospects for the spending bill’s passage.</p>
<p>Lawmakers are returning to Washington next week following a
traditional August recess spent mostly in their home states and
districts. They are not close to completing work on the dozen annual
appropriations bills that will fund the agencies during the next fiscal
year, so they’ll need to approve a stopgap measure to prevent a shutdown
when the new fiscal year begins October 1.</p>
<p>“Today, House Republicans are taking a critically important step to
keep the federal government funded and to secure our federal election
process,” Speaker Mike Johnson said in a statement. “Congress has a
responsibility to do both, and we must ensure that only American
citizens can decide American elections.”</p>
<p>Bipartisanship urged</p>
<p>But in a joint statement, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and
Appropriations Committee Chair Patty Murray said avoiding a shutdown
requires bipartisanship, not a bill drawn up by one party.</p>
<p>“If Speaker Johnson drives House Republicans down this highly
partisan path, the odds of a shutdown go way up, and Americans will know
that the responsibility of a shutdown will be on the House Republicans’
hands,” Schumer and Murray said.</p>
<p>It is a crime under federal law for a noncitizen to vote, or even
register to vote, in a federal election, according to the Brennan Center
for Justice.</p>
<p>Johnson’s decision to add the proof of citizenship requirement to the
spending measure comes after the House Freedom Caucus called for it in a
position statement last month. The group of conservatives, banking on a
win by Republican nominee Donald Trump, also urged that the measure fund
the government into early next year so Republicans could get more of
their priorities in legislation.</p>
<p>Some Republican leaders had wanted to pass the final spending bills
by the end of this Congress so that the new president, whether it be
Trump or Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, could focus more on getting
staffed and pursuing their own top priorities rather than dealing with
spending disagreements.</p>
<p>Republicans say requiring proof of citizenship would ensure American
elections are only for American citizens, improving confidence in the
nation’s federal election system. But opponents say the available
evidence shows that noncitizen voting in federal elections is incredibly
rare and such a requirement would disenfranchise millions of Americans
who don’t have the necessary documents readily available when they want
to register.</p>
<p>What remains to be seen is what happens if the bill passes the House
this week and the Senate declines to take it up or votes it down.</p>
<p>The bill would fund agencies at current levels until March 28, though
there’s also money to help cover additional security costs associated
with Inauguration Day and $10 billion for the Federal Emergency
Management Agency’s disaster relief fund.</p>

<h2 id="rare-copy-of-us-constitution-to-be-sold-at-auction">Rare copy of
US Constitution to be sold at auction</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ASHEVILLE, north carolina — Seth Kaller, an appraiser and collector
of historic documents, spreads a broad sheet of paper across a desk.
It’s in good enough condition that he can handle it, carefully, with
clean, bare hands. There are just a few creases and tiny discolorations,
even though it’s just a few weeks shy of 237 years old and has spent who
knows how long inside a filing cabinet in North Carolina. </p>
<p>At the top of the first page are familiar words but in regular type
instead of the sweeping Gothic script readers are accustomed to seeing:
“WE the People.” </p>
<p>And the people will get a chance to bid for this copy of the U.S.
Constitution — the only one of its type thought to be in private hands —
at a sale by Brunk Auctions on September 28 in Asheville, North
Carolina. </p>
<p>The minimum bid for the auction of $1 million has already been made.
There is no minimum price that must be reached. </p>
<p>This copy was printed after the Constitutional Convention finished
drafting the proposed framework of the nation’s government in 1787 and
sent it to the Congress of the ineffective first American government
under the Articles of Confederation, requesting that it be sent to the
states to be ratified by the people.</p>
<p>Few copies remain </p>
<p>It’s one of about 100 copies printed by the secretary of that
Congress, Charles Thomson. Just eight are known to still exist and the
other seven are publicly owned. </p>
<p>Thomson likely signed two copies for each of the original 13 states,
essentially certifying them. They were sent to special ratifying
conventions, where representatives, all white and male, wrangled for
months before accepting the structure of the U.S. government that
continues today. </p>
<p>“This is the point of connection between the government and the
people. The Preamble — ‘we, the people’ — this is the moment the
government is asking the people to empower them,” auctioneer Andrew
Brunk said. </p>
<p>What happened to the document up for auction between Thomson’s
signature and 2022 isn’t known. </p>
<p>Two years ago, a property was being cleared out in Edenton in eastern
North Carolina that was once owned by Samuel Johnston. He was the
governor of North Carolina from 1787 to 1789 and he oversaw the state
convention during his last year in office that ratified the
Constitution. </p>
<p>The copy was found inside a squat, two-drawer metal filing cabinet
with a can of stain on top, in a long-neglected room piled high with old
chairs and a dusty bookcase, before the old Johnston house was
preserved. The document was a broad sheet that could be folded one time
like a book. </p>
<p>“I get calls every week from people who think they have a Declaration
of Independence or a Gettysburg Address and most of the time it is just
a replica, but every so often something important gets found,” said
Kaller, who appraises, buys and sells historic documents. </p>
<p>“This is a whole other level of importance,” he added. </p>
<p>Washington letter</p>
<p>Along with the Constitution on the broad sheet printed front and back
is a letter from George Washington asking for ratification. He
acknowledged there would have to be compromise and that rights the
states enjoyed would have to be given up for the nation’s long-term
health. </p>
<p>“To secure all rights of independent sovereignty to each and yet
provide for the interest and safety for all — individuals entering into
society must give up a share of liberty to preserve the rest,” wrote the
man who would become the first U.S. president. </p>
<p>Brunk isn’t sure what the document might go for because there is so
little to compare it to. The last time a copy of the Constitution like
this sold, it went for $400 - in 1891. In 2021, Sotheby’s of New York
sold one of only 14 remaining copies of the Constitution printed for the
Continental Congress and delegates to the Constitutional Convention for
$43.2 million, a record for a book or document. </p>
<p>But that document was meant to be distributed to the Founding Fathers
as delegates to the Constitutional Convention. The signed copy being
sold later this month was one meant to be sent to leaders in every state
so people all around the country could review and decide if that’s how
they wanted to be governed, connecting the writers of the Constitution
to the people in the states who would provide its power and
legitimacy. </p>

in America could affect US nuclear umbrella over Seoul</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — A South Korean senior official has rekindled debate over
the U.S. commitment to that nation’s defense, bringing up the
possibility of the U.S. rolling back its nuclear umbrella if former
President Donald Trump is reelected.</p>
<p>Kim Tae-hyo, South Korea’s deputy national security director, said in
a Seoul forum Tuesday the reelection of Trump could “weaken a U.S.
nuclear umbrella” designed to protect South Korea from North Korean
aggression.</p>
<p>“Trump as candidate can be seen as pursuing transactional benefits in
terms of the South Korea-U.S. alliance,” Kim said, according to news
reports. “It is not unlikely that he would suggest negotiating defense
cost-sharing or the deployment of U.S. strategic assets from a cost
perspective.”</p>
<p>Skepticism about America’s willingness and capability to protect
South Korea from a North Korean nuclear attack has grown among South
Koreans as North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs become
increasingly sophisticated. A recent poll by South Korea’s Institute of
National Unification revealed that 66% of respondents supported the
country having its own nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Concern over commitment</p>
<p>Gary Samore, former White House coordinator for arms control and
weapons of mass destruction during the Obama administration, said Kim’s
remarks reflect widespread concern among U.S. allies.</p>
<p>There is a concern that “Trump, if reelected, would pursue policies
that will weaken U.S. alliances around the world, including in Europe
and East Asia,” Samore told VOA Korean Wednesday via email.</p>
<p>“In the case of Korea, Trump might seek to resume summit diplomacy
with Kim Jong Un and make concessions that weaken the U.S.-ROK alliance,
as he did at the Singapore summit in June 2018,” Samore said. ROK stands
for Republic of Korea, the official name for South Korea.</p>
<p>According to the joint statement released after the 2018 summit,
Trump “committed to provide security guarantees” to North Korea, while
the North Korean leader reaffirmed “commitment to complete
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”</p>
<p>“However, I think it’s premature to predict exactly what policies
President Trump will adopt toward Korea if he is reelected,” Samore
added. “There are too many uncertainties, including, for example, who
President Trump appoints for his top foreign policy and defense
positions.”</p>
<p>Michael O’Hanlon, director of foreign policy research at the
Brookings Institution in Washington, told VOA Korean Tuesday via email
the South Korean official’s assessment of Trump is justifiable.</p>
<p>“I think the official is correct,” O’Hanlon said, adding Trump could
take steps to address this concern. “I do not know if he will.”</p>
<p>‘Treat us properly,’ says Trump</p>
<p>Trump has often complained that U.S. allies do not pay the U.S.
enough for bases and troops used in their defense. In an April interview
with Time magazine, Trump said, “I want South Korea to treat us
properly,” suggesting he would demand that South Korea pay more for the
American troops stationed there.</p>
<p>But Frederick Fleitz, who served as chief of staff of the National
Security Council in the Trump White House, told VOA Korean by phone
Tuesday that Trump’s reelection is not likely to affect the U.S. nuclear
umbrella.</p>
<p>Making clear that he was speaking for himself, not for Trump, Fleitz
said the former president “was a strong friend of Japan, South Korea and
Taiwan when he was in office last time and he’ll be a strong friend
again.”</p>
<p>“Why would there be such a big change in a second Trump term when he
didn’t do that in the first term?” Fleitz asked. “The second Trump
administration, concerning South Korea, will be countering the threat
from North Korea and this new axis relationship between China, Russia,
North Korea and Iran.”</p>
<p>Fleitz stressed there is no evidence to suggest Trump would link the
defense cost-sharing with offering a nuclear umbrella, adding
discussions on how much South Korea pays for U.S. troops in South Korea
will not be a “deal breaker” for the second Trump administration.</p>
<p>“It is an issue that will be resolved among friends,” he said. “The
security threats in the region are so severe — I think that’s what the
U.S. will focus on.”</p>
<p>Redeployment of nukes</p>
<p>Robert Peters, a fellow for nuclear deterrence and missile defense at
the Heritage Foundation, told VOA Korean Tuesday via email it is “far
more likely” that America’s extended deterrence commitment to South
Korea would strengthen during a second Trump term.</p>
<p>Peters said a second Trump administration could consider redeploying
U.S. tactical nuclear weapons to the Korean Peninsula, due to the
threats coming from North Korea and China.</p>
<p>“I think a second Trump administration would field SLCM-N
[nuclear-armed, sea-launched cruise missiles] in the near term and
potentially reintroduce American nuclear weapons to South Korea as a
means to assure the ROK, deter North Korea and strengthen regional
stability,” said Peters.</p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, is
widely expected to inherit incumbent President Joe Biden’s Asia policies
should she win the election.</p>
<p>The Biden administration is not considering the redeployment of
tactical nuclear weapons to South Korea. In 1991, the U.S. withdrew from
South Korea all its nuclear weapons, roughly 100 in number, according to
some studies.</p>
<p>“The United States does not assess returning nuclear weapons to the
Indo-Pacific as necessary at this time,” a State Department spokesperson
said in an emailed statement on May 31 in response to a VOA Korean
inquiry. “The United States has no plans to forward deploy nuclear
weapons to the Korean Peninsula.”</p>
<p>In April 2023, Biden and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol adopted
the Washington Declaration, in which the U.S. declared that its
commitment to the defense of South Korea will be backed by the full
range of U.S. capabilities, including nuclear.</p>
<p>During this week’s high-level security talks between the U.S. and
South Korea, the Biden administration reiterated its commitment to
defend South Korea with nuclear weapons if necessary to deter attacks
from North Korea.</p>
<p>“We reaffirm the U.S. extended deterrence commitment to the ROK using
the full range of U.S. defense capabilities, and that any DPRK [North
Korea] nuclear attack on the United States or its allies and partners is
unacceptable and will result in the end of that regime,” Bonnie Jenkins,
U.S. undersecretary of state for arms control and international
security,  told reporters after Wednesday’s talks.</p>
<p>VOA Korean contacted the Trump campaign and asked what Trump’s stance
is on the U.S. nuclear umbrella offered to South Korea, but did not
receive a reply by the time this article was published.</p>

charged with plotting shooting at NYC Jewish center on Hamas attack
anniversary</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — A Pakistani man was arrested in Canada this week for
plotting a mass shooting at a Jewish center in Brooklyn on the one-year
anniversary of the October 7 attack by Hamas that sparked the latest
conflict in the Middle East, federal authorities announced Friday. </p>
<p>U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said Muhammad Shahzeb Khan had
attempted to travel from Canada, where he lives, to New York City with
the “stated goal of slaughtering, in the name of ISIS, as many Jewish
people as possible.” </p>
<p>The 20-year-old, who is also known as Shahzeb Jadoon, was apprehended
on September 4 and charged with attempting to provide material support
and resources to the terror group, which stands for the Islamic State of
Iraq and al-Sham. </p>
<p>“As I said to Canada’s minister of public safety yesterday, we are
deeply grateful to our Canadian partners for their critical law
enforcement actions in this matter,” Garland said in a statement.
“Jewish communities — like all communities in this country — should not
have to fear that they will be targeted by a hate-fueled terrorist
attack.” </p>
<p>It was unclear if Khan has a lawyer. There was no listing for the
case in the online federal court system. Edward Kim, a spokesperson for
the Manhattan federal prosecutor’s office, which is handling the case,
declined to respond to follow-up questions, including where Khan was
being held and when he would be brought to the U.S. to face the charges.
He deferred to Canadian authorities, who didn’t immediately respond to
emails seeking comment. </p>
<p>U.S. authorities said Khan began sharing ISIS propaganda videos and
expressing his support for the terror group in social media posts and
communications with others on an encrypted messaging app last
November. </p>
<p>In conversations with two undercover law enforcement officers, he
confirmed that he and another ISIS supporter based in the U.S. had been
planning to carry out attacks against Jewish centers in America and
needed to obtain AR-style assault rifles, ammunition and other
materials, according to the Justice Department. </p>
<p>Khan also provided details about how he would cross the border from
Canada into the U.S. and that he was considering conducting the attacks
on either the October 7 anniversary or on October 11, which is the
Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, authorities said. </p>
<p>Then on August 20, he told the undercover officers that he had
settled on targeting New York City because of its sizable Jewish
population and sent a photograph of the specific area inside a Jewish
center where he planned to carry out the attack, according to the
Justice Department. </p>
<p>Using three separate vehicles, Khan began traveling to the U.S. but
was stopped around Ormstown, a town in the Canadian province of Quebec
that is about 12 miles (19 kilometers) from the U.S. border, federal
authorities said.</p>

adversaries step up efforts to influence results of next election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Russia, Iran and China are ramping up efforts to impact
the outcome of the U.S. presidential election and down-ballot races,
targeting American voters with an expanding array of sophisticated
influence operations.</p>
<p>The latest assessment from U.S. intelligence agencies, shared Friday,
warns that Russia remains the preeminent threat, with Russian influence
campaigns seeking to boost the chances of Republican presidential
candidate and former U.S. President Donald Trump over Democratic
candidate Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>Russian actors, led by networks created by the Kremlin-backed media
outlet RT, “are supporting Moscow’s efforts to influence voter
preferences in favor of the former president and diminish the prospects
of the vice president,” a senior intelligence official told reporters,
briefing on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive
information.</p>
<p>“RT has built and used networks of U.S. and other Western
personalities to create and disseminate Russia-friendly narratives while
trying to mask the content in authentic Americans’ free speech,” the
official said.</p>
<p>And RT, the official added, is just part of a growing
Kremlin-directed campaign that is looking to impact not just the race
for the White House, but smaller elections across the United States,
with an added emphasis on swing states.</p>
<p>“Russia’s influence apparatus is very large and it’s worth
highlighting that they have other entities that are active,” the
official said. “Russia is working up and down ballot races, as well as
spreading divisive issues.”</p>
<p>Tracking the Russian influence efforts has become more difficult,
with U.S. officials saying that there is a greater degree of
sophistication and an increased emphasis on amplifying American voices
with pro-Russian views rather than seeding social media with narratives
crafted in the Kremlin.</p>
<p>“It’s not just about Russian bots and trolls and fake social media
persona, although that’s part of it,” White House national security
spokesperson John Kirby told VOA Friday.</p>
<p>“We’re not taking anything for granted,” he added. “There’s no
question that [Russian President Vladimir] Putin has every intent to try
to sow discord here in the United States, to try to pump disinformation
and Russian propaganda through to the American people, through what he
believes were our credible sources, be they online or on television and
we have to take that seriously.”</p>
<p>The intelligence officials declined to share additional specifics
about Russia’s network of influence operations. But indictments
Wednesday from the U.S. Justice Department have shed some light on the
scope of the Kremlin’s recent operations.</p>
<p>In one case, the U.S. charged two employees of RT with using fake
personas and shell companies to funnel almost $10 million to Tenet
Media, a Tennessee-based company producing videos and podcasts for a
stable of conservative political influencers.</p>
<p>The aim, prosecutors said, was to produce and disseminate content
promoting what Moscow viewed as pro-Russian policies.</p>
<p>In a separate action, the U.S. seized 32 internet domains linked to
an operation directed by a key aide to Putin. The aim, U.S. officials
said, was to mimic legitimate U.S. news sites to spread Russian-created
propaganda.</p>
<p>RT publicly ridiculed the allegations while some of the influencers
working with Tenet posted statements on the X social media platform
saying they were unaware of the company’s links to Moscow.</p>
<p>As for the latest U.S. intelligence allegations, the Russian Embassy
in Washington has yet to respond to VOA’s request for comments, though
it has described previous accusations as “Russophobic.”</p>
<p>Requests for comment to the Trump and Harris campaigns have also, so
far, gone unanswered.</p>
<p>But earlier U.S. intelligence assertions of Russian support for Trump
have raised the ire of the Trump campaign, which has pointed to public
statements by Russia’s Putin supporting Trump’s opponents.</p>
<p>“When President Trump was in the Oval Office, Russia and all of
America’s adversaries were deterred, because they feared how the United
States would respond,” national press secretary for the Trump campaign,
Karoline Leavitt, told VOA in an email this past July.</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence officials, however, said it would be a mistake to
put any faith in Putin’s words, including public comments Thursday
expressing support for Harris.</p>
<p>The U.S. intelligence community “does not take Putin’s public
statements as representative of Russia’s covert intentions,” the senior
official said. “There are many examples over the past several years
where Putin’s public statements do not align with Russian actions. For
example, his comments that he would not invade Ukraine.”</p>
<p>Experts say Iran, China trying to influence results</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence agencies Friday emphasized Russia is not alone in
its effort to shape the outcome of the U.S. elections in November,
warning both Tehran and Beijing are sharpening their influence campaigns
with just about 60 days until America voters go to the polls.</p>
<p>“Iran is making a greater effort than in the past to influence this
year’s elections, even as its tactics and approaches are similar to
prior cycles,” the intelligence official said, describing a
“multi-pronged approach to stoke internal divisions and undermine voter
confidence in the U.S. democratic system.</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence agencies previously assessed that Iran has focused
part of its efforts on denigrating the Trump campaign, seeing his
election as likely to worsen tensions between Tehran and Washington.</p>
<p>U.S. officials last month also blamed Iran for a hack-and-leak
operation targeting the Trump campaign, though they said that
Iran-linked actors have also sought to infiltrate the Harris
campaign.</p>
<p>As for China, U.S. intelligence officials said it appears Beijing is
still content to stay out of the U.S. presidential race, seeing little
difference between Trump and Harris.</p>
<p>But there are indications China is accelerating its efforts to impact
other political races.</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence “is aware of PRC [People’s Republic of China]
attempts to influence U.S. down-ballot races by focusing on candidates
it views as particularly threatening to core PRC security interests,”
the official said.</p>
<p>“PRC online influence actors have also continued small scale efforts
on social media to engage U.S. audiences on divisive political issues,
including protests about the Israel-Gaza conflict and promote negative
stories about both political parties,” the official added.</p>
<p>‘Malicious speculations against China’</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in Washington, Friday, rejected the U.S.
intelligence assessment.</p>
<p>“China has no intention and will not interfere in the U.S. election,
and we hope that the U.S. side will not make an issue of China in the
election,” spokesperson Liu Pengyu told VOA in an email.</p>
<p>Liu added that accusations Beijing is using social media to sway U.S.
public opinion “are full of malicious speculations against China, which
China firmly opposes.”</p>
<p>While U.S. intelligence officials have identified Russia, Iran and
China, as the most prominent purveyors of disinformation, they are not
alone.</p>
<p>Officials have said countries like Cuba are also engaging in
influence operations, though at a much smaller scale.</p>
<p>And other countries are edging closer to crossing that line.</p>
<p>“We are seeing a number of countries considering activities that, at
a minimum, test the boundaries of election influence,” according to the
U.S. assessment. “Such activities include lobbying political figures to
try to curry favor with them in the event they are elected to
office.”</p>

id="sergio-mendes-grammy-winning-brazilian-music-legend-dies-at-83">Sergio
Mendes, Grammy-winning Brazilian music legend, dies at 83</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>RIO DE JANEIRO — Sergio Mendes, the celebrated Brazilian musician
whose 1966 hit “Mas Que Nada” made him a global superstar and helped
launch a long, Grammy-winning career, has died after months battling the
effects of long COVID. He was 83.</p>
<p>The death Thursday of the Brazilian pianist, songwriter and arranger
was confirmed in a statement by his family.</p>
<p>“His wife and musical partner for the past 54 years, Gracinha
Leporace Mendes, was by his side, as were his loving children,” the
statement said Friday. “Mendes last performed in November 2023 to sold
out and wildly enthusiastic houses in Paris, London and Barcelona.”</p>
<p>Mendes was born in Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro’s sister city, and studied
classical music at a conservatory before joining jazz groups. In the
late 1950s and early 1960s, he began playing Bossa Nova as the genre was
heating up in Rio’s nightclub scene with Antonio Carlos Jobim, Joao
Gilberto and others.</p>
<p>In 1962, they traveled to New York for a Bossa Nova festival at
Carnegie Hall. During the trip, Cannonball Adderley invited Mendes to
collaborate on the album “Cannonball Adderley and The Bossa Rio Sextet,”
leading to his first American record, “The Swinger from Rio,” after
signing with Atlantic Records.</p>
<p>Two years later, Mendes moved to California and formed Brazil ’64,
which evolved into Brazil ’66 after he added two female vocalists. The
group’s debut album, produced by Herb Alpert, featured “Mas Que Nada.”
Sung entirely in Portuguese, “Mas Que Nada” was a mid-tempo Samba number
originally released in 1963 by composer Jorge Ben Sor and updated three
years later by Mendes, who had been playing the song in clubs and gave
it a jazzier, more hard-hitting feel.</p>
<p>“I put a band together called Brasil ’66,” he told The Guardian in
2019. “I’d always had instrumental groups, but when I added the two
female singers — Lani Hall and Bibi Vogel — it made a different kind of
sound. We recorded the song in Los Angeles, with me, the drums, bass and
guitar all performing live.”</p>
<p>Mendes’ version was a worldwide hit that helped perpetuate the
Brazilian music boom of the 1960s. In 2006, a modern version of the song
topped U.S. charts, as performed by the Black Eyed Peas. It was included
in his album “Timeless,” produced by will.i.am and also featuring Stevie
Wonder, Justin Timberlake and John Legend, among others.</p>
<p>“Sergio Mendes was my brother from another country,” trumpet player
Alpert wrote on Facebook, along with a photo from decades ago, sitting
next to Mendes at the piano. “He was a true friend and extremely gifted
musician who brought Brazilian music in all its iterations to the entire
world with elegance.”</p>
<p>Mendes’ other hits were an eclectic blend ranging from covers of the
Beatles’ “The Fool on the Hill” and “With a Little Help from My
Friends,” to his own Brazilian chant, “Magalenha.” Mendes also composed
the soundtrack for the film “Pele,” featuring saxophonist Gerry
Mulligan, and even produced an album recorded by the great Brazilian
soccer player.</p>
<p>Mendes won the 1992 Grammy Award for Best World Music Album for
“Brasileiro” and two Latin Grammy Awards. He also received an Oscar
nomination in 2012 for Best Original Song for “Real in Rio,” from the
animated film “Rio.”</p>
<p>“Brazilian soul was there,” pianist, singer, and songwriter Marcos
Valle told GloboNews about Mendes’ music. Valle also noted that it was
Mendes who helped open doors for other Brazilian artists of his
generation, including himself, to reach foreign audiences.</p>

to continue to enforce sanctions after aircraft linked to Venezuela’s
Maduro seized, Blinken says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic — U.S. Secretary of State Antony
Blinken said on Friday that the United States will continue enforcing
sanctions against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro following the
seizure and investigation of two aircraft linked to him earlier this
week in the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>On Friday, Blinken held discussions with Dominican President Luis
Abinader during his first official visit to Santo Domingo as the top
U.S. diplomat.</p>
<p>Blinken underscored the U.S. commitment to continued collaboration
with the Dominican Republic to promote inclusive economic growth,
strengthen democratic institutions, uphold human rights, and improve
governance and security.</p>
<p>On Monday, U.S. authorities seized a plane used by Maduro, the
equivalent to the U.S. Air Force One. The aircraft, undergoing
maintenance in the Dominican Republic, was seized for being illegally
purchased through a shell company and smuggled out of the United States,
violating U.S. export control and sanctions laws.</p>
<p>After the controversial reelection of Maduro on July 28, Venezuela
suspended commercial flights to and from the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>A second plane linked to Maduro is under investigation in the
Dominican Republic. This aircraft is similar to the one seized on Monday
and is listed among the sanctioned assets by the U.S. Treasury as
belonging to Maduro.</p>
<p>“With regard to the plane seizures, we’ve been very clear. We’ll
implement our sanctions, and if we find violations of them, we will act.
That’s what we did, and that’s what we’ll continue to do,” Blinken told
reporters during a joint press conference with Abinader at the National
Palace.</p>
<p>The Dominican Republic will host the 2025 Summit of the Americas,
where Western Hemisphere leaders will address shared challenges and
policy issues facing the region.</p>
<p>On August 16, Abinader was sworn in for a second four-year term,
vowing to enhance security by increasing police training over the next
four years. His administration has also implemented policies barring
migrants from neighboring Haiti.</p>
<p>The U.S. has urged the Dominican Republic to establish a path toward
normalization with Haiti, as border tensions continue to escalate.</p>
<p>Blinken said he and Abinader are committed to support the Haitians to
build security and “make sure the people are treated humanely.”</p>
<p>Abinader told reporters his country will continue moving forward and
normalizing the relationship with Haiti, such as opening air flights,
but the security and safety of citizens of the Dominican Republic is
still the priority.</p>
<p>The U.S. and the Dominican Republic signed a historic Open Skies
agreement on August 2. Once in effect, the agreement will expand
opportunities for airlines, travel companies and people-to-people
exchanges. More than 4 million U.S. citizens visit the Dominican
Republic each year.</p>
<p>The Dominican Republic is a crucial partner for the U.S. in
hemispheric affairs, due to its position as the second-largest economy
in the Caribbean, after Cuba, and the third-largest country by
population, behind Cuba and Haiti. The U.S. is its primary trading
partner.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Dominican Republic is home to Pueblo Viejo, one of
the world’s largest gold mines, and serves as a major global supplier of
ferronickel, used for making stainless steel.</p>
<p>The Dominican Republic and the United States, along with five Central
American countries, are parties to the Dominican Republic-Central
America Free Trade Agreement, known as CAFTA-DR. This agreement enhances
economic opportunities by eliminating tariffs, opening markets, reducing
barriers to services and promoting transparency.</p>
<p>The U.S. Agency for International Development is investing more than
$9.5 million to strengthen the Dominican Republic’s existing justice
system and to reduce crime and violence.</p>
<p>Blinken also announced on Friday “the first phase of a supply chain
investment through USAID, an initial $3 million that will help the
Dominican government improve its workforce training, build industrial
parks, attract high-tech industries here to the Dominican Republic.”</p>

<p>So given that, xmem can be useful as a monitoring tool. Fluffy (my

64MB of RAM, things can get a little cramped. If I suddenly see that the
whole of xmem turns blue (i.e. the swap file’s thrashing), then I know
that something is odd, and I can easily find out which processes are
eating up so much RAM. I said earlier that xmem can brighten up one’s

fitting I should like xmem. 🙂 Here’s a full screenshot showing xmem

id="judge-delays-trumps-sentencing-in-hush-money-case-until-after-november-election">Judge
delays Trump’s sentencing in hush money case until after November
election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — A judge agreed Friday to postpone Donald Trump’s
sentencing in his hush money case until after the November election,
granting the Republican presidential nominee a hard-won reprieve as he
navigates the aftermath of his criminal conviction and the homestretch
of his campaign.</p>
<p>Manhattan Judge Juan M. Merchan, who is also weighing a defense
request to overturn the verdict on immunity grounds, delayed Trump’s
sentencing until November 26, several weeks after the final votes are
cast in the presidential election.</p>
<p>It had been scheduled for September 18, about seven weeks before
Election Day.</p>
<p>Merchan wrote that he was postponing the sentencing “to avoid any
appearance — however unwarranted — that the proceeding has been affected
by or seeks to affect the approaching presidential election in which the
Defendant is a candidate.”</p>
<p>“The Court is a fair, impartial, and apolitical institution,” he
said.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers pushed for the delay on multiple fronts, petitioning
the judge and asking a federal court to intervene. They argued that
punishing the former president and current Republican nominee in the
thick of his campaign to retake the White House would amount to election
interference.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers argued that delaying Trump’s sentencing until after
the election would also allow him time to weigh next steps after Merchan
rules on the defense’s request to reverse his conviction and dismiss the
case because of the U.S. Supreme Court’s July presidential immunity
ruling.</p>
<p>In his order Friday, Merchan delayed a decision on that until
November 12.</p>
<p>Judge rejects Trump request</p>
<p>A federal judge on Tuesday rejected Trump’s request to have the U.S.
District Court in Manhattan seize the case from Merchan’s state court.
Had they been successful, Trump’s lawyers said they would have then
sought to have the verdict overturned and the case dismissed on immunity
grounds.</p>
<p>Trump is appealing the federal court ruling.</p>
<p>The Manhattan district attorney’s office, which prosecuted Trump’s
case, deferred to Merchan and did not take a position on the defense’s
delay request.</p>
<p>Messages seeking comment were left for Trump’s lawyers and the
district attorney’s office.</p>
<p>Election Day is November 5, but many states allow voters to cast
ballots early, with some set to start the process just a few days before
or after September 18.</p>
<p>Trump was convicted in May on 34 counts of falsifying business
records to conceal a $130,000 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy
Daniels just before the 2016 presidential election. Daniels claims she
and Trump had a sexual encounter a decade earlier after they met at a
celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe.</p>
<p>Prosecutors cast the payout as part of a Trump-driven effort to keep
voters from hearing salacious stories about him during his first
presidential campaign. Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen paid Daniels
and was later reimbursed by Trump, whose company logged the
reimbursements as legal expenses.</p>
<p>Trump maintains that the stories were false, that reimbursements were
for legal work and logged correctly, and that the case — brought by
Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat — was part of a
politically motivated “witch hunt” aimed at damaging his current
campaign.</p>
<p>Democrats spotlight Trump’s conviction</p>
<p>Democrats backing their party’s nominee, Vice President Kamala
Harris, have made his conviction a focus of their messaging.</p>
<p>In speeches at the Democratic Party’s convention in Chicago last
month, President Joe Biden called Trump a “convicted felon” running
against a former prosecutor.</p>
<p>Representative Jasmine Crockett, a Texas Democrat labeled Trump a
“career criminal with 34 felonies, two impeachments and one porn star to
prove it.”</p>
<p>Trump’s 2016 Democratic opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton, inspired chants of “lock him up” from the convention crowd when
she quipped that Trump “fell asleep at his own trial, and when he woke
up, he made his own kind of history: the first person to run for
president with 34 felony convictions.”</p>
<p>Falsifying business records is punishable by up to four years behind
bars. Other potential sentences include probation, a fine or a
conditional discharge, which would require Trump to stay out of trouble
to avoid additional punishment. Trump is the first ex-president
convicted of a crime.</p>
<p>Trump has pledged to appeal, but that cannot happen until he is
sentenced.</p>
<p>In seeking the delay, Trump lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove argued
that the short time between the scheduled immunity ruling on September
16 and sentencing, which was to have taken place two days later, was
unfair to Trump.</p>
<p>To prepare for a September 18 sentencing, the lawyers said,
prosecutors would be submitting their punishment recommendation while
Merchan is still weighing whether to dismiss the case. If Merchan rules
against Trump, he would need “adequate time to assess and pursue state
and federal appellate options,” they said.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court’s immunity decision reins in prosecutions of
ex-presidents for official acts and restricts prosecutors in pointing to
official acts as evidence that a president’s unofficial actions were
illegal.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers argue that in light of the ruling, jurors in the hush
money case should not have heard such evidence as former White House
staffers describing how the then-president reacted to news coverage of
the Daniels deal.</p>

<h2 id="trump-assails-women-who-accused-him-of-misconduct">Trump assails
women who accused him of misconduct</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Shortly after appearing in court for an appeal of a
decision that found him liable for sexual abuse, Donald Trump stepped
Friday in front of television cameras and brought up a string of past
allegations of other acts of sexual misconduct, potentially reminding
voters of incidents that were little-known or forgotten. </p>
<p>The former president has made hitting back at opponents and accusers
a centerpiece of his political identity, but his performance at his
namesake Manhattan office tower was startling even by Trump’s own
combative standards. At times he seemed to relish using graphic language
and characterizations of the case, which could expose the former
president to further legal challenges. </p>
<p>Trump’s remarks came just four days before he will debate Vice
President Kamala Harris, with early voting about to begin in some parts
of the country and Election Day just two months away. </p>
<p>Trump is staying in the public eye while Harris prepares for the
debate in private with her advisers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. That’s
a reflection of their divergent campaign styles, with Trump frequently
engaging with reporters — often in friendly settings — while Harris has
done just one interview and no news conferences since taking President
Joe Biden’s place atop the Democratic ticket. </p>
<p>Trump on Friday repeatedly brought up Harris’ lack of news
conferences. But his own comments — in which he talked about the cases
against him for more than half an hour without mentioning any campaign
issues — threatened to cause him more legal jeopardy. And after
convening reporters for what his campaign said was a news conference,
Trump walked off without taking any questions. </p>
<p>Legal team makes arguments</p>
<p>A jury returned a $5 million verdict finding Trump liable of sexually
abusing advice columnist E. Jean Carroll in 1996. His legal team made
its appeal arguments Friday morning. </p>
<p>Juries now have twice now awarded Carroll huge sums for Trump’s
claiming she made up a story about him attacking her in a department
store dressing room in 1996 to help her sell a memoir. </p>
<p>But that hasn’t stopped Trump from continuing to make nearly
identical statements to reporters. At his news briefing Friday, he said
again that Carroll was telling a “made up, fabricated story.” </p>
<p>Carroll’s lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, warned in March after a jury
awarded Carroll another $83 million that she would continue to monitor
Trump’s comments and would consider suing again if he kept it up. </p>
<p>Earlier in court, he walked in quietly and passed in front of Carroll
without acknowledging or looking at her. </p>
<p>The former president reacted at times during the proceedings, such as
shaking his head when Carroll’s attorney said that Trump sexually abused
her client. He periodically tilted his head from side to side, but
otherwise sat still and mostly alone. </p>
<p>A Manhattan jury in May found Trump responsible for sexual abuse.
Carroll says Trump attacked her in a department store dressing room, but
the former president’s legal team says the verdict should be overturned
because some evidence that was allowed during the trial should have been
excluded while other evidence that should be excluded was allowed. He
denies guilt. </p>
<p>In the midst of running for president and facing a series of other
legal cases against him, Trump did not attend the Carroll trial and
wasn’t there when the charges were read — though he assailed the verdict
as “a disgrace” on his social media site. </p>
<p>Later Friday, he’s traveling to Charlotte, North Carolina, to address
the Fraternal Order of Police. </p>
<p>More than 12 women make accusations</p>
<p>Carroll is one of more than a dozen women who have accused Trump of
sexual assault or harassment. She went public in a 2019 memoir. Trump
denied it, saying he never encountered Carroll at the store and did not
know her. He has called her a “nut job” who invented her story to sell a
memoir. </p>
<p>Trump faces unprecedented criminal and civil jeopardy for a
major-party nominee. </p>
<p>He has separately been convicted on 34 felony counts in a New York
state case related to hush money payments allegedly made to a porn
actor. The judge in that case is expected to decide Friday whether to
postpone Trump’s sentencing. </p>
<p>Trump has also been ordered to pay steep civil fines for lying about
his wealth for years. </p>
<p>And he’s still contending with cases alleging his mishandling of
classified documents, his actions after the 2020 election, and his
activities during the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 —
though none are likely to go to trial prior to Election Day.</p>

id="teen-charged-in-georgia-school-shooting-and-his-father-to-stay-in-custody-after-hearings">Teen
charged in Georgia school shooting and his father to stay in custody
after hearings</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Winder, Georgia — The 14-year-old suspect in a shooting that killed
four people at a Georgia high school and his father, who was arrested
for allowing his son to have a weapon, will stay in custody after their
lawyers decided not to seek bail Friday. </p>
<p>Colt Gray, who has been charged with four counts of murder, is
accused of using a semiautomatic assault-style rifle to kill two fellow
students and two teachers Wednesday at Apalachee High School in Winder,
outside Atlanta. His father, Colin Gray, faces related charges in the
latest attempt by prosecutors to hold parents responsible for their
children’s actions in school shootings. </p>
<p>The two appeared in back-to-back hearings Friday morning with about
50 onlookers in the courtroom, where workers had set out boxes of tissue
along the benches, in addition to members of the media and sheriff’s
deputies. Some victims’ family members in the front row hugged each
other and one woman clutched a stuffed animal. </p>
<p>During his hearing, Colt Gray, wearing khaki pants and a green shirt,
was advised of his rights as well as the charges and penalties he faced
for the shooting at the school where he was a student. </p>
<p>After the hearing, he was escorted out in shackles at the wrists and
ankles. The judge then called the teen back to the courtroom to correct
an earlier misstatement that his crimes could be punishable by death.
Because he’s a juvenile, the maximum penalty he would face is life
without parole. The judge also set another hearing for December 4.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, Colin Gray was brought into court dressed in a
gray-striped jail uniform. Colin Gray, 54, was charged Thursday in
connection with the shooting and answered questions in a barely audible
croak, giving his age and saying he finished 11th grade, earning a high
school equivalency diploma. </p>
<p>Colin Gray has been charged with involuntary manslaughter and
second-degree murder related to the shooting, Georgia Bureau of
Investigation Director Chris Hosey said. </p>
<p>“His charges are directly connected with the actions of his son and
allowing him to possess a weapon,” Hosey said. </p>
<p>The charges come five months after Michigan parents Jennifer and
James Crumbley were the first convicted in a U.S. mass school shooting.
They were sentenced to at least 10 years in prison for not securing a
firearm at home and acting indifferently to signs of their son’s
deteriorating mental health before he killed four students in 2021. </p>
<p>The Georgia shootings have also renewed debate about safe storage
laws for guns and have parents wondering how to talk to their children
about school shootings and trauma. </p>
<p>The Barrow County hearings for the father and son came as police in
the Atlanta suburb of Dunwoody said schools there and nationwide have
received threats of violence since the Apalachee High School shooting,
police said in a statement. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation also
noted that numerous threats have been made to schools across the state
this week. </p>
<p>Before Colin Gray’s arrest was reported, the AP knocked on the door
of a home listed as his address seeking comment about his son’s
arrest. </p>
<p>According to arrest warrants obtained by The Associated Press, Colt
Gray is accused of using a “black semi-automatic AR-15 style rifle” to
kill the two students and two teachers. Authorities have not offered any
motive or explained how he obtained the gun or got it into the
school. </p>
<p>He was charged as an adult in the deaths of Mason Schermerhorn and
Christian Angulo, both 14, Richard Aspinwall, 39, and Cristina Irimie,
53. Nine people were also hurt in Wednesday’s attack. </p>
<p>A neighbor remembered Schermerhorn as inquisitive when he was a
little boy. Aspinwall and Irimie were both math teachers, and Aspinwall
also helped coach the school’s football team. Irimie, who immigrated
from Romania, volunteered at a local church, where she taught
dance. </p>
<p>Colt Gray denied threatening to carry out a school shooting when
authorities interviewed him last year about a menacing post on social
media, according to a sheriff’s report obtained Thursday. Conflicting
evidence on the post’s origin left investigators unable to arrest
anyone, the report said. Jackson County Sheriff Janis Mangum said she
reviewed the report from May 2023 and found nothing that would have
justified bringing charges at the time. </p>
<p>The attack was the latest among dozens of school shootings across the
U.S. in recent years, including especially deadly ones in Newtown,
Connecticut; Parkland, Florida; and Uvalde, Texas. The classroom
killings have set off fervent debates about gun control but there has
been little change to national gun laws. </p>
<p>It was the 30th mass killing in the U.S. this year, according to a
database maintained by The Associated Press and USA Today in partnership
with Northeastern University. At least 127 people have died in those
killings, which are defined as events in which four or more people die
within a 24-hour period, not including the killer — the same definition
used by the FBI.</p>

id="us-iraq-deal-would-see-hundreds-of-troops-withdraw-in-first-year-sources-say">US-Iraq
deal would see hundreds of troops withdraw in first year, sources
say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>baghdad — The United States and Iraq have reached an understanding on
plans for the withdrawal of U.S.-led coalition forces from Iraq,
according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The plan, which has been broadly agreed but requires a final go-ahead
from both capitals and an announcement date, would see hundreds of
troops leave by September 2025, with the remainder departing by the end
of 2026, the sources said.</p>
<p>“We have an agreement, it’s now just a question of when to announce
it,” a senior U.S. official said.</p>
<p>The U.S. and Iraq are also seeking to establish a new advisory
relationship that could see some U.S. troops remain in Iraq after the
drawdown.</p>
<p>An official announcement was initially scheduled for weeks ago but
was postponed because of regional escalation related to Israel’s war in
Gaza and to iron out some remaining details, the sources said.</p>
<p>The sources include five U.S. officials, two officials from other
coalition nations, and three Iraqi officials, all speaking on condition
of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the matter
publicly.</p>
<p>Several sources said the deal could be announced this month.</p>
<p>Farhad Alaaldin, foreign affairs adviser to the Iraqi prime minister,
said technical talks with Washington on the coalition drawdown had
concluded.</p>
<p>“We are now on the brink of transitioning the relationship between
Iraq and members of the international coalition to a new level, focusing
on bilateral relations in military, security, economic, and cultural
areas,” he said.</p>
<p>He did not comment on details of the plan and the U.S.-led coalition
did not respond to emailed questions.</p>
<p>The agreement follows more than six months of talks between Baghdad
and Washington, initiated by Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani in
January amid attacks by Iran-backed Iraqi armed groups on U.S. forces
stationed at Iraqi bases.</p>
<p>The rocket and drone attacks have killed three American troops and
wounded dozens more, resulting in several rounds of deadly U.S.
retaliation that threatened government efforts to stabilize Iraq after
decades of conflict.</p>
<p>The U.S. has approximately 2,500 troops in Iraq and 900 in
neighboring Syria as part of the coalition formed in 2014 to combat
Islamic State as it rampaged through the two countries.</p>
<p>The group once held roughly a third of Iraq and Syria but was
territorially defeated in Iraq at the end of 2017 and in Syria in 2019.
Iraq had demonstrated its ability to handle any remaining threat,
Alaaldin said.</p>
<p>The U.S. initially invaded Iraq in 2003, toppling dictator Saddam
Hussein before withdrawing in 2011, but returned in 2014 at the head of
the coalition to fight Islamic State.</p>
<p>Other nations, including Germany, France, Spain and Italy, also
contribute hundreds of troops to the coalition.</p>
<p>Under the plan, all coalition forces would leave the Ain al-Asad
airbase in western Anbar province and significantly reduce their
presence in Baghdad by September 2025.</p>
<p>U.S. and other coalition troops are expected to remain in Irbil, in
the semi-autonomous northern Kurdistan region, for approximately one
additional year, until around the end of 2026, to facilitate ongoing
operations against Islamic State in Syria.</p>
<p>Exact details of troop movements are being kept secret because of
their military sensitivity.</p>
<p>The drawdown would mark a notable shift in Washington’s military
posture in the region.</p>
<p>While primarily focused on countering Islamic State, U.S. officials
acknowledge their presence also serves as a strategic position against
Iranian influence.</p>
<p>This position has grown more important as Israel and Iran escalate
their regional confrontation, with U.S. forces in Iraq shooting down
rockets and drones fired towards Israel in recent months, according to
U.S. officials.</p>
<p>Prime Minister al-Sudani has stated that while he appreciates their
help, U.S. troops have become a magnet for instability, frequently
targeted and responding with strikes often not coordinated with the
Iraqi government.</p>
<p>The agreement, when announced, would likely present a political win
for al-Sudani as he balances Iraq’s position as an ally of both
Washington and Tehran. The first phase of the drawdown would end one
month before Iraqi parliamentary polls set for October 2025.</p>
<p>The State Department and U.S. Embassy in Baghdad did not respond to
requests for comment.</p>

<h2 id="oversize-evs-have-some-big-issues">Oversize EVs Have Some Big
Issues</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-06, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzU5NzkwMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NjUzNzcxOH0.kbRJ9fRniNH9oJVAukkev3LkJeJFCxEvEcqN1Fliq5g/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
A few Super Bowls ago, when General Motors used its ad spots to pitch
Americans on the idea of the GMC Hummer EV, it tried to flip the script
on the stereotypes that had always dogged the gas-guzzling SUV. Yes, it
implied, you can drive a military-derived menace to society and still do
your part for the planet, as long as it’s electric.
</p>
<p>
You don’t hear much about the Hummer anymore — it didn’t sell especially
well, and the Tesla Cybertruck came along to fill the tank niche in the
electric car market. But the reasoning behind its launch endures. Any
EV, even a monstrous one, is a good EV if it convinces somebody,
somewhere, to give up gasoline.
</p>
<p>
This line of thinking isn’t wrong. A fully electric version of a big
truck or SUV is far better, emissions-wise, than a gas-powered vehicle
of equivalent size. It’s arguably superior to a smaller and efficient
combustion car, too. A
<a href="https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id=47821" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Ford
F-150 Lightning</u></a>, for example, scores nearly 70 in the
Environmental Protection Agency’s miles per gallon equivalent metric,
abbreviated MPGe, that’s meant to compare the energy consumption of EVs
and other cars. That blows away the 20-some miles per gallon that the
gas F-150 gets and even exceeds the 57 combined miles per gallon of the
current Toyota Prius hybrid.
</p>
<p>
In terms of America’s EV adoption, then, we’ve come to see all EVs as
being created equal. Yet our penchant for large EVs that aren’t
particularly efficient at squeezing miles from their batteries will
become a problem as more Americans go electric.
</p>
<p>
Big, heavy cars use more energy. This is how we worried about the
greenness of cars back in the days before the EV: Needlessly enormous
models such as the Ford Expedition and the Hummer H2 deserved to be
shamed, while owning a fuel-sipping hybrid or a dinky subcompact was the
height of virtue.
</p>
<p>
This logic has gotten a bit lost in the scale-up phase of electric
vehicles going mainstream. We talk at length about EV sales and how fast
their numbers are growing; we rarely talk about whether the EVs we buy
are as energy-efficient as they could be. As a new white
<a href="https://www.aceee.org/white-paper/2024/08/electric-vehicle-efficiency-unlocking-consumer-savings-and-environmental-gains" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>paper</u></a>
from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy points out,
though, getting more miles out of our EV batteries would save drivers
money and reduce the strain on the grid that will come from millions of
people charging their cars.
</p>
<p>
The simplest way to measure an EV’s fuel efficiency is to know how many
miles it travels per kilowatt-hour of electricity. Popular crossovers
like Tesla’s Model Y and Kia’s EV6 achieve a pretty-good 3.5 miles per
kilowatt-hour. Look at bigger, heavier vehicles and you’ll see a major
fall-off. InsideEVs
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/721071/2024-rivian-r1s-epa-range-consumption-price/#:~:text=EPA%20energy%20consumption%20(Combined)%20of,mi%20(2.2%20mi%2FkWh)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>found</u></a>
that Rivian’s R1S gets between 2.1 and 2.4 miles per kilowatt-hour. The
hulking Hummer EV
<a href="https://www.motortrend.com/reviews/2023-gmc-hummer-ev-pickup-range-fast-charging/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>scores
just 1.5</u></a>, according to Motor Trend’s testing.
<a href="https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/PowerSearch.do?action=alts&path=3&year1=2019&year2=2021&vtype=Electric&srchtyp=newAfv" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>The
EPA’s MPGe data</u></a> is another way to see the same story. The
60-some miles per gallon equivalent of an electric pickup like the
Rivian R1T or Chevy Silverado EV crushes the mileage of petro trucks,
but pales next to the 140-plus MPGe that an electric sedan from Hyundai
or Lucid can claim. (Those EVs can deliver 4 or more miles per
kilowatt-hour.)
</p>
<p>
Even modest gains in EV efficiency could cause beneficial ripple
effects, the ACEEE says. Drivers who own a 3.5 miles per kilowatt-hour
car would save hundreds of dollars on fuel annually compared to those
whose vehicles get 2.5 miles per kilowatt-hour. More efficient cars
should be less expensive, as well. Huge, inefficient EVs need to carry
enormous batteries just to reach an adequate range, and the bigger the
battery, the bigger the cost. Whereas a Model Y’s battery capacity
ranges from 60 kilowatt-hours for standard range to 81 kilowatt-hours
for long range, a Rivian’s runs from 92 to 141.5 kilowatt-hours. ACEEE
calculates that the jump from 2.5 to 3.5 kilowatt-hours could shave
nearly $5,000 from the cost of making a car because it would need so
much less battery.
</p>
<p>
Making EVs more efficient would mean faster charging stops, too, since
drivers wouldn’t need to cram so many kilowatt-hours into their
batteries. It would ease demand for electricity, making it easier for
the grid to keep pace with an electrifying society. But convincing
Americans to buy smaller, more efficient vehicles has been an uphill
battle for decades.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this summer, Ford CEO Jim Farley
<a href="https://observer.com/2024/07/why-ford-ceo-jim-farley-thinks-americans-love-for-large-cars-is-a-problem/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>called</u></a>
for a return to smaller vehicles as more of the U.S. car fleet turns
over to electric. Yet it was Ford that just a few years ago quit making
cars altogether (outside of the Mustang) because it reaped so much more
profit on the pricier crossovers, SUVs, and pickups that Americans have
voted for with their wallets. And not long after Farley’s speech, the
company
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ford-ev-suv-canceled" target="_self"><u>scaled
back</u></a> its EV ambitions, clearly struggling to find a way to sell
electric vehicles profitably.
</p>
<p>
The issue is not only carbuyers’ preference for big, heavy vehicles.
ACEEE points out that public policy doesn’t punish big electric cars.
“The EPA standard treats all EVs as having zero emissions. It therefore
provides no incentive to improve EV efficiency since inefficient and
efficient EVs are treated the same for compliance purposes,” the paper
says.
</p>
<p>
That is why ACEEE floats the idea of a policy change. For example, its
paper suggests the fees some states levy against EVs (ostensibly to make
up for the lost revenue from those cars avoiding the gas tax) could be
tweaked to charge more for inefficient EVs. Rebates for purchasing an EV
could be changed in the same manner.
</p>
<p>
It was, after all, regulatory
<a href="https://www.distilled.earth/p/the-loophole-that-made-cars-in-america" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>loopholes</u></a>
and misplaced incentives that helped big gas guzzlers conquer the roads
in the first place. With better rules about big EVs, perhaps we could
avoid repeating the mistakes of the past.

US jobs report clears way for Federal Reserve to cut interest rates</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Hiring by America’s employers picked up a bit in August
from July’s tepid pace, and the unemployment rate dipped for the first
time since March in a sign that the job market may be cooling but
remains sturdy.  </p>
<p>Employers added a modest 142,000 jobs, up from a scant 89,000 in
July, the Labor Department said Friday. The unemployment rate ticked
down to 4.2% from 4.3% in July, which had been the highest level in
nearly three years. Hiring in June and July, though, was revised sharply
down by a combined 86,000. July’s job gain was the smallest since the
pandemic.  </p>
<p>“The labor market is weakening,” said Eugenio Aleman, chief economist
at Raymond James Financial. “It is not falling apart, but it is
weakening.”  </p>
<p>The cooling jobs figures underscore why the Federal Reserve is set to
cut its key interest rate when it next meets September 17-18, with
inflation falling steadily back to its target of 2%. Friday’s mixed jobs
report raises the question of how large a rate cut the Fed will
announce. It could decide to reduce its benchmark rate by a typical
quarter-point or by a larger-than-usual half-point. In the coming
months, the policymakers will also decide how much and how fast to cut
rates at their subsequent meetings.   </p>
<p>Christopher Waller, an influential Fed policymaker, suggested in a
speech Friday that the central bank is leaning toward a quarter-point
reduction this month. But he left the door open for larger rate cuts, if
necessary, later this year.  </p>
<p>“I do not expect this first cut to be the last,” Waller said in a
speech at the University of Notre Dame. “With inflation and employment
near our longer-run goals and the labor market moderating, it is likely
that a series of reductions will be appropriate.”  </p>
<p>“I am open-minded,” he added, “about the size and pace of cuts, which
will be based on what the data tell us about the evolution of the
economy.”  </p>
<p>Collectively, Friday’s figures depict a job market slowing under the
pressure of high interest rates but still growing. Many businesses
appear to be holding off on adding jobs, in part because of uncertainty
about the outcome of the presidential election and about how fast the
Fed will reduce its benchmark rate in the coming months.  </p>
<p>Daniel Zhao, lead economist at the career website Glassdoor, said
some of the details in the August jobs report indicate that businesses’
demand for workers is slowing. The number of Americans who are working
part time but would prefer full-time work rose, extending a year-long
trend.  </p>
<p>“When you look under the hood, you’re seeing numbers that confirm
that the job market is on that cooling trajectory,” Zhao said.  </p>
<p>America’s labor market is now in an unusual place: Jobholders are
mostly secure, with layoffs low, historically speaking. Yet with the
pace of hiring having weakened, landing a job has become harder.  </p>
<p>In the past three months, hiring has averaged only 116,000 a month,
down sharply from an average of 211,000 a year ago. And August’s job
gains were concentrated in just a few industries, with health care
adding 44,000 jobs, restaurants, hotels and entertainment companies
gaining 46,000, and construction 34,000. Steady hiring by restaurants
and hotels could reflect ongoing gains in consumer spending, which rose
last month even after adjusting for inflation.  </p>
<p>In a major speech last month, Chair Jerome Powell suggested that the
Fed’s policymakers have all but tamed inflation through high interest
rates and don’t want to see the job market weaken further. The central
bank is trying to achieve a “soft landing,” in which it succeeds in
driving inflation down from a 9.1% peak in 2022 to its target level
without causing a recession. A lower Fed benchmark rate will lead
eventually to lower borrowing costs for a range of consumer and business
loans, including mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.  </p>
<p>For now, companies are posting fewer job openings and adding fewer
workers, while Americans are far less likely to quit their jobs now than
they were soon after the economy rebounded from the pandemic. In a
strong job market, workers are more likely to quit, usually for
higher-paying opportunities. With quits declining, it means fewer jobs
are opening up for people out of work.  </p>
<p>Becky Frankiewicz, North American president of the staffing firm
ManpowerGroup, said that uncertainty around the presidential election
and the Fed’s next moves are causing many companies to hold back on new
investments and hiring.  </p>
<p>“There’s a whole world waiting to see what happens with our
election,” she said. “We have this great waiting game. No one wants to
make big moves yet.”  </p>
<p>Still, Frankiewicz said the job market appears to be stable for
now.  </p>
<p>“The bottom isn’t falling out, and we’re not seeing a rocket ship,”
she said. “It’s stability.”  </p>
<p>A slower pace of hiring is often a precursor to layoffs — one reason
why the Fed’s policymakers are now more focused on sustaining the health
of the job market than on continuing to fight inflation.  </p>
<p>Recent economic data has been mixed, elevating the importance of the
jobs report, which is among the more comprehensive economic snapshots of
the government issues. The Labor Department surveys roughly 119,000
businesses and government agencies and 60,000 households each month to
compile the employment data.  </p>
<p>The Fed’s Beige Book, a collection of anecdotes from the 12 regional
Fed banks, reported that many employers appeared to have become pickier
about whom they hired in July and August. And a survey by the Conference
Board in August found that the proportion of Americans who think jobs
are hard to find has been rising, a trend that has often correlated with
a higher unemployment rate.  </p>
<p>At the same time, consumer spending, the principal driver of economic
growth in the United States, rose at a healthy pace in July. And the
economy grew at a solid 3% annual pace in the April-June quarter.</p>

accuses US of unacceptable pressure on Russian media</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Moscow — The Kremlin on Friday accused the United States of applying
unacceptable pressure on Russian media after the U.S. Justice Department
charged Russian TV contributor Dimitri Simes and his wife with schemes
to violate U.S. sanctions. </p>
<p>The two indictments were announced just one day after the U.S. took
several legal actions against Russia to combat alleged efforts to meddle
in the 2024 presidential elections, including charging two employees of
the Russian state media network RT and sanctioning RT and its top
network editor. </p>
<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who has said Russia is not seeking
to interfere in the U.S. presidential election, told reporters that
Washington was trying to ensure that Moscow’s own perspective on world
affairs was not available to people. </p>
<p>“Washington continues to try to put pressure on Russia, on Russian
citizens, and even on the Russian media, which is engaged in informing
both citizens inside our country and world public opinion about what is
happening, from our perspective,” said Peskov. </p>
<p>“Washington does not even accept that there should be options out
there for anyone to get news from our perspective.  </p>
<p>This is nothing other than blatant pressure. We strongly condemn this
stance as unacceptable,” he said. </p>
<p>Moscow still grants accreditation to Western journalists to work in
Russia, though many have left since the start of the Ukraine war in 2022
and the arrest of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich on
spying charges in March 2023. </p>
<p>Gershkovich, who denied the charges, was freed in a prisoner swap
last month. </p>
<p>Russia has said it will take retaliatory measures against U.S. media
in response to Washington’s moves against RT. </p>
<p>Asked what those measures would be, Peskov said Russia carefully
evaluated the editorial policies of various foreign media outlets and
would take those factors into account when making any decisions, on what
he suggested would be a case-by-case basis.</p>

Federal Reserve independence has come into the spotlight recently, with

a scheme to sway then-Federal Reserve Chair Arthur Burns — and the
direction of the U.S. economy — in the run-up to reelection. But first:
Hiring was weaker than expected in August.

IRS enforcement efforts recover $1.3 bln in unpaid taxes, Treasury
says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue Service said on
Friday that they have recovered $1.3 billion in unpaid taxes from
wealthy individuals under new enforcement initiatives funded by $60
billion in IRS modernization spending from the climate-focused Inflation
Reduction Act.  </p>
<p>Why it’s important </p>
<p>Republicans in Congress have long vowed to rescind the 10-year IRS
funding passed in 2022, arguing that it would unfairly harass Americans
on their taxes. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump vowed on
Thursday to rescind all unspent funds from the Inflation Reduction Act,
which include billions of dollars earmarked for the IRS.  </p>
<p>The IRS has planned to spend about $10.6 billion of those funds
through end of the 2024 fiscal year, which concludes on Sept. 30,
leaving nearly $50 billion that could be recouped. But budget
forecasters say that doing so would increase the federal budget deficit
by more than $100 billion over a decade because the agency would forego
stepped-up enforcement.  </p>
<p>By the numbers  </p>
<p>The Treasury said that in the first six months of a new initiative to
target 125,000 wealthy individuals who have not filed tax returns since
2017, it has collected $172 million from 21,000 non-filing
taxpayers.  </p>
<p>Another initiative to target wealthy individuals with more than $1
million in income and $250,000 in unpaid, recognized tax debts has
brought in $1.1 billion to Treasury coffers.   </p>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the audit rate for
millionaires fell by 80% due to budget cuts at the IRS.  </p>
<p>“During the previous [Trump] administration, as audit rates on
high-income taxpayers fell, the share of audits on taxpayers with
incomes under $200,000 increased,” Yellen said in remarks to be
delivered at an IRS service center in Austin, Texas. “In 2019, the top
one percent of Americans was estimated to owe over one-fifth of unpaid
taxes, leaving ordinary Americans to shoulder the burden.”</p>

job growth misses expectations in August; unemployment rate slips to
4.2%</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. employment increased less than expected in August,
but a drop in the jobless rate to 4.2% suggested an orderly labor market
slowdown continued and probably did not warrant a big interest rate cut
from the Federal Reserve this month.  </p>
<p>Nonfarm payrolls increased by 142,000 jobs last month after a
downwardly revised 89,000 rise in July, the Labor Department’s Bureau of
Labor Statistics said on Friday. Economists polled by Reuters had
forecast payrolls increasing by 160,000 jobs after a previously reported
114,000 gain in July. Estimates ranged from 100,000 to 245,000
jobs.  </p>
<p>The smaller-than-expected increase in payrolls likely does not signal
a deterioration in labor market conditions.  </p>
<p>August payrolls have a tendency to initially print weaker relative to
the consensus estimate and recent trend before being revised higher
later. Hiring typically picks up in the education sector, which is
anticipated by the model that the government uses to strip out seasonal
fluctuations from the data.  </p>
<p>The start of the new school year, however, varies across the country,
which can throw off the so-called seasonal factors. The initial August
payrolls counts have been revised higher in 10 of the last 13 years.
Layoffs remain at historic low levels.  </p>
<p>The drop in the unemployment rate followed four straight monthly
increases, which had lifted it near a three-year high of 4.3% in July.
Early on Friday, financial markets saw a roughly 43% probability of a
half-point rate cut at the Fed’s Sept. 17-18 policy meeting, according
to CME Group’s FedWatch Tool. The odds of a 25 basis point rate
reduction were around 57%.  </p>
<p>Average hourly earnings increased 0.4% in August after falling 0.1%
in July. Wages increased 3.8% year-on-year after advancing 3.6% in July.
Still-solid wage growth continues to underpin the economy through
consumer spending.</p>

“This string of record temperatures is increasing the likelihood of 2024

halt of foreign adoptions leaves questions about pending cases</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>beijing — The Chinese government is ending its intercountry adoption
program, and the U.S. is seeking clarification on how the decision will
affect hundreds of American families with pending applications. </p>
<p>In a phone call with U.S. diplomats in China, Beijing said it “will
not continue to process cases at any stage” other than those cases
covered by an exception clause. The embassy is seeking clarification in
writing from China’s Ministry of Civil Affairs, the U.S. State
Department said Thursday. </p>
<p>“We understand there are hundreds of families still pending
completion of their adoption, and we sympathize with their situation,”
the State Department said. </p>
<p>At a daily briefing Thursday, Mao Ning, a spokeswoman for the Chinese
foreign ministry, said China is no longer allowing foreign adoptions of
the country’s children, with the only exception for blood relatives to
adopt a child or a stepchild. </p>
<p>She didn’t explain the decision other than to say that it was in line
with the spirit of relevant international conventions. </p>
<p>Many foreigners have adopted children from China over the decades,
visiting the country to pick them up and then bringing them to a new
home overseas.  </p>
<p>U.S. families have adopted 82,674 children from China, the most from
any foreign country. </p>
<p>China suspended international adoptions during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The government later resumed adoptions for children who had received
travel authorization before the suspension in 2020, the U.S. State
Department said in its latest annual report on adoptions.  </p>
<p>A U.S. consulate issued 16 visas for adoptions from China from
October 2022 through September 2023, the first in more than two years,
the State Department report said. It wasn’t clear if any more visas had
been issued since then. </p>
<p>In January, Denmark’s only overseas adoption agency said it was
winding down operations after concerns were raised about fabricated
documents and procedures, and Norway’s top regulatory body recommended
stopping overseas adoptions for two years pending an investigation into
several cases. </p>
<p>Beijing’s announcement also has followed falling birth rates in the
country. The number of newborn babies fell to 9.02 million in 2023, and
the overall population declined for the second consecutive year.</p>

Almost Killed This Arizona Town. Now Copper Could Save It.</h2>

<p class="drop-caps">
In the town of Superior, Arizona, there is a hotel. In the hotel, there
is a room. And in the room, there is a ghost.
</p>
<p>
Henry Muñoz’s father owned the building in the early 1980s, back when it
was still a boarding house and the “Magma” in its name, Hotel Magma,
referred to the copper mine up the hill. One night, a boarder from
Nogales, Mexico, awoke to a phantom trying to pin her to the wall with
the mattress; naturally, she demanded a new room. When Muñoz, then in
his fearless early 20s, heard this story from his father, he became
curious. Following his swing shift at the mine, Muñoz posted himself to
the room with a case of beer and passed the hours until dawn drinking
and waiting for the spirit to make itself known.
</p>
<p>
Muñoz didn’t see a ghost that night, but he has since become well
acquainted with others in town. There is the Mexican bakery, which used
to sell pink cookies but now opens only when the late owner’s
granddaughter feels up to it. There’s the old Magma Club, its
once-segregated swimming pool — available one day a week to Hispanics —
long since filled in. Muñoz can still point out where all the former
bars were on Main Street, the ones that drew crowds of carousing miners
in the good years before copper prices
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/19/business/commodities-worrisome-stagnation-in-copper.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>plunged
in 1981</u></a> and Magma boarded up and left town. Now their dusty
windows are what give out-of-towners from nearby Phoenix reason to
<a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g28924-i139-k862433-Hey_Local_Experts_What_s_with_Superior-Arizona.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>write
off</u></a> Superior as “dead.”
</p>
<p>
“What happens when a mine closes, the hardship that brings to people —
today’s generation has never experienced that,” Muñoz told me.
</p>
<p>
Superior is home to about 2,400 people, less than half its population
when the mine was booming. To tourists zipping past on U.S. 60 to visit
the Wild West sites in the Superstition Mountains, it might look half a
step away from becoming a ghost town, itself. As recently as 2018,
pictures of Main Street were used as stock photos to illustrate things
like
“<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-16/geographic-economic-inequality-is-growing-in-the-u-s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>America’s
worsening geographic inequality</u></a>.”
</p>
<p>
But if you take the exit into town, it’s clear something in Superior is
changing. The once-haunted boarding house has undergone a
multi-million-dollar renovation into a boutique hotel, charging
staycationers that make the hour drive south from Scottsdale $200 a
night. Across the street, Bellas Cafe whips up terrific sandwiches in a
gleaming, retro-chic kitchen. The Chamber of Commerce building, a little
further down the block, has been painted an inviting shade of purple.
And propped in the window of some of the storefronts with their lights
on, you might even see a sign: WE SUPPORT RESOLUTION COPPER.
</p>
<p>
Resolution Copper’s offices are located in the former Magma Hospital,
where Muñoz was born and where his mother died. People in hard hats and
safety vests mill about the parking lot, miners without a mine, which is
not an unusual sight in Superior these days — no copper has been sold
out of the immediate area in over two decades. And yet just a
nine-minute drive further up the hill and another 15-minute elevator
ride down
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-arizona-copper-mine/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
deepest mine shaft in the country</u></a> lies one of the world’s
largest remaining copper deposits. It’s estimated to be 40 billion
pounds, enough to meet a quarter of U.S. demand, according to the
company’s analysis.
</p>
<p>
That’s “huge,” Adam Simon, an Earth and environmental sciences professor
at the University of Michigan, told me, and not just in terms of sheer
size.
</p>
<p>
“Copper is the most important metal for all technologies we think of as
part of the energy transition: battery electric vehicles, grid-scale
battery storage, wind turbines, solar panels,” Simon said. In May, he
<a href="https://www.ief.org/focus/ief-reports/copper-mining-and-vehicle-electrification" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>published
a study</u></a> with Lawrence Cathles, an Earth and atmospheric sciences
researcher at Cornell University, which looked at 120 years of
copper-mining data and found that just to meet the demands of “business
as usual,” the world will need 115% more of the material between 2018
and 2050 than has been previously mined in all of human history, even
with recycling rates taken into account.
</p>
<p>
Aluminum, used in high-voltage lines, is sometimes floated as a
potential substitute, but it’s not as good of a conductor, and copper is
almost always the preferred metal in batteries and electricity
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/magnets-and-electricity.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>generation</u></a>.
Renewables are particularly copper-intensive; one offshore wind turbine
can
<a href="https://www.energymonitor.ai/tech/renewables/weekly-data-why-keeping-an-eye-on-copper-is-vital-for-the-energy-transition/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>require
up to 29 tons</u></a>. What lies in the hills behind Superior, then,
represents “millions of electric vehicles, millions of wind turbines,
millions of solar panels. And it’s also lots of jobs, from top to bottom
— jobs for people with bachelor’s degrees in engineering, mining,
geology, and environmental science, all the way down to security
officers and truck drivers,” Simon said. He added: “The world will need
more copper year over year for both socioeconomic improvement in the
Global South and also the energy transition, and neither of those can
happen without increasing the amount of copper that we produce.”
</p>
<p>
Muñoz insisted to me that the promises of jobs and a robust local
economy are a kind of Trojan horse. “Everybody’s getting drunk and
having a good time: ‘Oh, look at the gift they brought us!’” he said of
Superior’s support for Resolution Copper. “But at night, they’re going
to sneak out of that horse, and they’re going to leave an environmental
disaster.”
</p>
<p>
For now, though, the copper has just one catch: Resolution isn’t allowed
to touch it.
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
If not for a painted sign declaring the ground HOLY LAND, there would be
nothing visible to suggest the 16 oak-shaded tent sites over Resolution
Copper’s ore body were anything particularly special. The Oak Flat
campground is less than five miles past Superior, but at an elevation of
nearly 4,000 feet, it can feel almost 10 degrees Fahrenheit cooler. On
the late June day that I visited with Muñoz, Sylvia Delgado, and Orlando
“Marro” Perea — the leaders of the Concerned Citizens and Retired Miners
Coalition — the floor of the East Valley was 113 degrees Fahrenheit, and
the altitude offered only limited relief.
</p>
<p>
Directly below us and to the east of the campground, beneath a bouldery,
yucca-studded desert, lies the copper deposit. At 7,000 or so feet deep,
extracting it would require an advanced mining process called
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDPLBAA93hc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>block
caving</u></a>, in which ore is collected from below through what is
essentially a controlled cave-in, like sand slipping through the neck of
an hourglass.
</p>
<p>
Muñoz, a fifth-generation miner, prefers the metaphor of going to the
dentist. “They drill out your tooth and refill it: that’s basically
traditional cut-and-fill mining,” he told me. “Block cave, on the other
hand, would be going to the dentist and having them pull out the whole
molar. It just leaves a vacant hole.” In this case, the resulting cavity
would be almost two miles wide and over 1,000 feet deep by the time the
ore was exhausted sometime in the 2060s.
</p>
<p>
Even four decades is just a blink of an eye for Oak Flat, though, where
human history goes back at least 1,500<em> </em>years; anthropologists
say the mine’s sinkhole would
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Archaeological-Sites-with-Apache-Affinities-in-the-Oak-Flat-National-Register-Historic_tbl1_322035020" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>swallow</u></a>
countless Indigenous burial locations and archeological sites, including
petroglyphs depicting antlered animals that Muñoz and Perea showed me
hidden deep in the rocks. Even more alarmingly, the subsidence would
obliterate Chí’chil Biłdagoteel, the Western Apache’s name for the lands
around Oak Flat, which are
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2021/04/12/oak-flat-apache-sacred-land/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>sacred</u></a>
to at least 10 federally recognized tribes. The members of the San
Carlos Apache who are leading the opposition effort, and use the
location for a four-day-long girlhood coming-of-age ceremony, say it is
<a href="https://www.niwrc.org/restoration-magazine/june-2021/oak-flat-chichil-bildagoteel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
only place</u></a> where their prayers can reach the Creator directly.
</p>
<p>
Mining and Indigenous sovereignty have been at odds in Arizona for over
a century. “The Apache is as near the <em><em>lobo</em></em>, or wolf of
the country, as any human being can be to a beast,” <em><em>The New York
Times</em></em> wrote in 1859, claiming the tribe was “the greatest
obstacle to the operations of the mining companies” in the area. Three
years later, the U.S. Army’s departmental commander ordered Apache men
killed “wherever found,” the social archaeologist John Welch writes in
his eye-opening
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322035020_Earth_Wind_and_Fire_Pinal_Apaches_Miners_and_Genocide_in_Central_Arizona_1859-1874/download" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>historical
survey</u></a> of the region, in which he also advocates for using the
term “genocide” to describe the government’s policies. That violence
still casts a shadow in Superior: Apache Leap, an astonishing escarpment
that looms over the town and backs up against Oak Flat, is named for a
legend that cornered Apache warriors jumped to their deaths from its
cliffs rather than surrender to the U.S. Cavalry.
</p>
<p>
As the Apache were being forced onto reservations and into residential
boarding schools during the late 1890s, a treaty with the government set
aside Oak Flat for protection. The land was later
<a href="https://www.resolutionmineeis.us/sites/default/files/project-files/20-fr-7336.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>fortified
against mining</u></a> by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, with the
federal protections reconfirmed by the Nixon administration in the
1960s. (The defunct Magma Mine that fueled the first copper boom in
Superior is located just off this 760-acre “Oak Flat Withdrawal Area.”)
</p>
<p>
In 1995, the enormity of the Oak Flat ore body — and the billions it
would be worth if it could be accessed — started to become apparent. The
British and Australian mining companies Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton
formed a U.S. subsidiary, Resolution Copper, which bought the old Magma
mine and began to lobby Arizona politicians to sign over the neighboring
parcel of Oak Flat. Between 2004 and 2013, lawmakers from the state
introduced 11 different land transfer bills into Congress, none of which
managed to earn broad support.
</p>
<p>
Then, in December 2014, President Barack Obama signed a must-pass
defense spending bill. On
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150206051206/https://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/12/10/re-raiding-native-sacred-places-defense-authorization-everything-wrong-congress" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>page
1,103</u></a> was a midnight rider, inserted by Arizona Republican
Senators John McCain and Jeff Flake, which authorized a land transfer of
2,400 acres of Tonto National Forest, including Oak Flat, to Resolution
Copper in exchange for private land the company had bought in other
parts of the state. (Flake previously worked as a
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/29/opinion/selling-off-apache-holy-land.html?_r=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>paid
lobbyist</u></a> for a Rio Tinto uranium mine, and the company

to McCain’s 2014 Senate campaign.)

</p>
<p>
The senators’ rider also included an odd little twist. While the
National Environmental Policy Act requires the Forest Service to conduct
an environmental impact statement for a potential mine, the bill
stipulated that the land transfer to Resolution Copper had to be
completed within a 60-day window of the final environmental impact
statement’s release, <em><em>regardless</em></em> of what the FEIS
found.
</p>
<p>
After six years of study, the FEIS was
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/24/trump-mining-arizona-holy-land-oak-flat-tribes" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rushed
to publication</u></a> by President Donald Trump in the final five days
of his term, triggering that 60-day countdown. President Biden rescinded
Trump’s FEIS once he took office in 2021, pending
<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2021/03/01/forest-service-delays-oak-flat-land-swap-copper-mine-plan/6875101002/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>further
consultation</u></a> with the tribes, but the clock will begin anew once
a revised FEIS is released, potentially later this year. (The new FEIS
was expected last summer, but the Forest Service has since reported
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mrv2cr6o0eu5wmps2oe5b/USDOJ-Correspondence-to-9th-Cir.-Court_18May2023_Update-concerning-timeline-for-EIS-completion.pdf?rlkey=76tdqz2srs6siz7vh5o1nyzsw&e=1&dl=0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>there
is no timeline</u></a> for its release. The agency declined to comment
to Heatmap for this story, citing ongoing litigation.)
</p>
<p>
A spokesperson for Resolution Copper told me that the company is
“committed to being a good steward of the land, air, and water
throughout the entirety of this project,” and described programs to
restore the local ecology and preserve certain natural features,
including Apache Leap. “At each step,” the spokesperson said, “we have
taken great care to solicit and act upon the input of our Native
American and other neighbors. We have made many changes to the project
scope to accommodate those concerns and will continue those efforts over
the life of the project.”
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Apache Stronghold — the San Carlos Apache-led religious
nonprofit opposing the mine — filed a lawsuit to block the land
transfer, arguing that the destruction of Oak Flat infringes on their
First Amendment right to practice their religion. The lower courts
<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2024/03/01/appeals-court-rejects-bid-to-block-resolution-copper-mine-at-oak-flat/72810397007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>haven’t
agreed</u></a>, citing a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyng_v._Northwest_Indian_Cemetery_Protective_Ass%27n" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>controversial</u></a>
1988 decision against tribes who made a similar argument in defense of a
sacred grove of trees in California. Apache Stronghold, joined by the
religious liberty group
<a href="https://www.becketlaw.org/case/apache-stronghold-v-united-states/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Becket</u></a>,
is now asking the U.S. Supreme Court to hear its case, a decision that
is
<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2021/03/01/forest-service-delays-oak-flat-land-swap-copper-mine-plan/6875101002/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>expected
any day now</u></a>. Nearly everyone I spoke with for this story,
however, was pessimistic that the Justices would agree to hear the
battle over Oak Flat, meaning the lower court’s ruling against Apache
Stronghold would stand.
</p>
<p>
<strong><br/></strong>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
If Mila Besich could have it her way, Biden would visit Superior. He’d
marvel at Apache Leap and Picketpost Mountain, visit the impressive new
Superior Enterprise Center — paid for partially with money from his 2021
American Rescue Plan Act — and maybe wrap up the day with a purple scoop
of prickly pear ice cream from Felicia’s Ice Cream Shop. And, most
importantly, he’d
<a href="https://copperarea.com/thank-you-president-biden-please-come-visit-arizonas-copper-corridor/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hear
her pitch</u></a>: that “Superior and the state of Arizona have a
once-in-a-generation opportunity to be the leader in advancing your
green energy strategy.” She says Superior — and America — needs this
mine.
</p>
<p>
Superior is a blue town, and Besich, its mayor, is a Democrat, which
means she has found herself in the awkward position of defending
Resolution Copper against colleagues like Congressman Raúl Grijalva of
Tucson and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who have introduced
unsuccessful bills in Congress to prevent the land transfer. There is
something of a bitter irony, too, in seeing her party
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifp9UtoxA3Q" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tout
the economic upsides of the energy transition</u></a> while standing in
the way of Superior’s mine, which would employ an average of 1,434
workers per year and add over $1 billion annually to Arizona’s economy
during its lifespan, according to the FEIS.
</p>
<p>
“Every mayor wants more jobs in their community,” Besich told me simply.
But, she also pointed out, “Copper is critical to the green economy, so
if we want the green economy, we should want to be mining American
copper.”
</p>
<p>
Superior, of course, isn’t just any town. “Everybody here either worked
in the mines or had family that worked in the mines,” James Schenck, a
former employee of Resolution Copper who supports the mine and serves as
the treasurer for Rebuild Superior, a nonprofit working to diversify the
local economy, told me. “They understand the downsides, and some of
them, for a while, were having a hard time understanding how this is
different than what went on before.”
</p>
<p>
Though everyone seems to be on cordial terms — at one point during my
visit, I was having lunch with Muñoz and Delgado when Besich walked in,
and everyone smiled politely at one another — there are still clear
factions. A Facebook group for locals warns against “posts concerning
DRAMA, POLITICS, RELIGION, and MINING,” presumably the same topics to be
avoided at family Thanksgivings.
</p>
<p>
The critical mineral experts I talked to for this story, though, said
Schenck is largely right on that point. “Mining in 2024 is radically
different than mining in 1954 or in 1904,” Simon told me. “It is really
surgical.”
</p>
<p>
Muñoz is one of those in town who still isn’t buying it, and has
converted his garage into an interpretive center for exposing the
perceived infiltrators. As soft classic rock played over the speakers
and a fan whirred to keep us cool, he showed me the 3D model he had
commissioned of the Oak Flat sinkhole, with a miniature Eiffel Tower
subsumed in its crater for scale. Laid out on a table on the other side
of the room was a row of six dictionary-thick, spiral-bound sections of
the FEIS, their most pertinent sections bookmarked. On the walls, Muñoz
had hung pictures of comparable tailings sites in other parts of the
world — cautionary tales of the
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/MINING-TAILINGS1/0100B4S72K1/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hazards</u></a>
posed during the long lifespan of mines. (Including the water demands,
<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/09082024/arizona-copper-mining-water-impact/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>no
small concern in a place like Arizona</u></a>, which opens a whole
<em><em>other</em></em> can of worms).
</p>
<p>
“I use my experience to educate the people,” Muñoz said. “This isn’t
what it’s made out to be. They’re going to play you.”
</p>
<p>
Muñoz was employed at the Magma Copper mine until 1982, when he was 27.
“One day they said, ‘We’re shutting down.’ They folded up just like a
carnival does on Monday morning,” he recalled. The abrupt departure
devastated Superior: <em><em>In These Times</em></em>
<a href="https://inthesetimes.com/article/in-an-arizona-town-left-behind-dreams-for-the-future" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>described</u></a>
the following years as an “economic cataclysm” for the town. By 1989,
the median household income was just $16,118 compared to $36,806 in
Queen Creek, the nearest Phoenix suburb just a 45-minute drive away.
</p>
<p>
“I witnessed grown men cry,” Muñoz said. “Men who’d been in the mines
pretty close to 30 years — they never knew nothing else.” His father,
the former boarding house owner, was among them: “He had limited writing
abilities and what have you. He was 58. People lost their homes here.
They lost their cars. There were divorces. Some people committed
suicide. The drinking, the drugs. It was a bad time.”
</p>
<p>
Muñoz went on food stamps and unemployment. “This generation that is
coming up, they’ve never experienced that,” he said. “They’ve never
experienced a repossession note in the mail from the bank. They’ve never
experienced a disconnection notice hanging from your front door knob.
And they’ve never experienced calling up the utilities and saying, ‘Hey,
can you wait until Friday when my unemployment check comes in?’”
</p>
<p>
Superior’s story isn’t unique; Arizona’s Copper Triangle is a
constellation of hollowed-out company towns. Like many other out-of-work
Magma miners, Muñoz eventually found a job at San Manuel, a BHP-owned
<a href="https://blog.azgs.arizona.edu/blog/2020-02/when-ground-comes-tumbling-down-subsidence-accompanies-block-caving" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>block
cave mine</u></a> about an hour south of Superior. Then, in 1999, copper
prices stuttered again, and by 2003, it shut down, too.
</p>
<p>
Muñoz had just returned from a car show in San Manuel when we met in his
garage, and he reported it was still a sorry sight. “The main grocery
store is closed, the Subway, all the buildings are boarded up, and the
schools are shut down,” he said. The mine “just abandoned that town.”
</p>
<p>
<strong><br/></strong>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
Even as Muñoz and the Concerned Citizens and Retired Miners Coalition
work with Apache Stronghold and national environmentalist groups like
<a href="https://www.hechoonline.org/blog/blog-the-community-must-know-resolution-copper-mines-ugly-truth" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>HECHO</u></a>,
the
<a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/michael-brune/2020/12/save-oak-flat" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Sierra
Club</u></a>, and the
<a href="https://blog.nwf.org/2024/08/protect-oak-flat-how-to-help/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>National
Wildlife Federation</u></a> try to block Resolution Copper’s mine, there
is a distinct feeling in Superior of its inevitability. Schenck, the
treasurer for Rebuild Superior, told me he suspects just “10% or 15%” of
people in town are “against the project.”
</p>
<p>
“My personal belief is this copper deposit is going to be developed at
some point,” Schenck said. “It’s too important.”
</p>
<p>
Besich, the mayor, gave this impression too. “What people need to
understand is, this ore body is not going anywhere,” she said. “Someone
will mine it in the future.” She views Superior and the copper industry
as partners in an “arranged marriage,” and her job as mayor is helping
them “figure out how to get along.”
</p>
<p>
From the outside, though, Resolution Copper looks more like a sugar
daddy. To date, Rio Tinto and BHP have spent
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/arizona-copper-mine-fight-religion-politics-cb06ab89" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
than $2 billion combined</u></a> pursuing the Oak Flat mine, including
pumping money into the Chamber of Commerce building, the Enterprise
Center, and the fire department. When the town of Kearny, downstream of
the mine’s proposed tailings site, needed a new ambulance, Resolution
Copper offered
<a href="https://copperarea.com/kearny-ambulance-transitions-to-cvrmc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>to

Critics say Resolution Copper is buying political and social influence
in the Copper Corridor, a modern-day iteration of the propaganda tactics
that swept aside the Apache in the late 1800s. Rio Tinto and BHP “remain
committed to influencing U.S. government decisions about the use of
public lands and minerals, regardless of additional harms to those
lands, to Native Americans, or to National Register historic sites and
sacred places,” the archaeologist Welch wrote in his Oak Flat study.
</p>
<p>
Rio Tinto is infamous even in the mining industry for its poor history
of handling community- and heritage-related concerns. To pick a recent
example, the company drew international condemnation for its 2020
destruction of the Juukan Gorge cave in Western Australia, a sacred site
to the Aboriginal people that had evidence of
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/26/rio-tinto-blasts-46000-year-old-aboriginal-site-to-expand-iron-ore-mine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>continuous
human occupation</u></a> going back to the Ice Age. Though Rio Tinto had
the legal right to destroy the 45,000-year-old caves, “it is hard to
believe community engagement is being taken seriously” by the company,
Glynn Cochrane, a former Rio Tinto senior advisor,
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230603042713/https://www.aph.gov.au/DocumentStore.ashx?id=c12ebf73-b3ae-41c5-bd40-c884f1495467&subId=687693" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said
in a testimony</u></a> in the aftermath. Archaeologists and sympathetic
politicians have warned that the cultural and spiritual loss caused by
mining Oak Flat would

like a second Juukan Gorge</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
The San Carlos Apache are not a monolith, however, and the community has
<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/2015/07/23/oak-flat-sacred/30587803/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>differing
beliefs</u></a> about the cultural importance of Oak Flat. Tribal
members who support the mine or work for Resolution Copper are often
cited by non-Native supporters as proof of Apache Stronghold’s
supposedly arbitrary defense of Oak Flat. (Apache Stronghold, which is
on

Heatmap’s request for comment.)
</p>
<p>
Muñoz and his team are specifically worried about how Superior, the
town, will make out. U.S. copper smelters are
<a href="https://www.rosemontminetruth.com/rosemont-will-destroy-santa-rita-mountains-to-export-copper-overseas/#:~:text=There%20are%20only%20three%20smelters%20in%20the%20U.S." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>already
at capacity</u></a>, meaning Resolution Copper would likely send much if
not all of the raw copper extracted at Oak Flat
<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/2022/04/12/resolution-copper-mine-would-destroy-sacred-land-smelt-china/9515287002/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>to
China</u></a> for processing. (Rio Tinto’s largest shareholder is the
Aluminum Corporation of China.) The spokesperson for Resolution Copper
told me that it’s the company’s priority to process the ore
domestically, and Rio Tinto does have its own facility in the U.S., the
Kennecott copper smelting facility in Utah. Yet it hasn’t committed
publicly to processing the Arizona ore there, and it’s far from clear
that it even has the capacity to do so.
</p>
<p>
For Simon, the University of Michigan professor, that shouldn’t be a
deterrent: “If we mine more copper here and it just means we have to
export it — who cares?” he pushed back. “If it has to go to China and
they smelt it, then you send it to China and they smelt it. Climate is
the prize, and if we want to mitigate our impact, we’ve got to do it.
There are no ifs, ands, or buts.”
</p>
<p>
Oak Flat is also located outside of Superior’s town limits, meaning the
community would only recoup about $500,000 in tax revenue, on the high
end, from the mine annually, according to the 2021 FEIS — Schenek told
me the town’s budget is around $3 million, so it’s hardly insignificant,
though it is peanuts compared to the $38 million the state would reap.
The FEIS additionally estimated that only about a quarter of the mine’s
eventual employees would actually “seek to live in or near Superior;”
many would choose instead to commute the hour or so from Phoenix’s
Maricopa County.
</p>
<p>
Because of technological advances in mining and robotics, the mine also
won’t bring back the physical jobs locals remember from the 1970s — by
Resolution Copper’s
<a href="https://www.hcn.org/issues/48-2/how-a-huge-arizona-mining-deal-was-passed/#:~:text=admitted%20that%20Chavez%20is%20probably%20right" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>own
admission</u></a>. Besich, at least, isn’t bothered by this detail: “In
all reality, I don’t see my children and their peers wanting to do the
manual physical labor that my grandfather, my father, and certainly my
great-grandfather did,” she told me. “So the change in technique is
good, and I think that it’s actually better for the environment in the
long term.” She added that Resolution Copper’s investment in things like
local infrastructure and worker training programs will compensate for
the comparably insignificant tax revenue the town will otherwise
receive, ensuring Superior gets a fair cut of the bonanza.
</p>
<p>
What supporters and opponents of the mine can agree on is that Superior
must avoid the devastation of the 1980s if or when the Oak Flat mine is
exhausted in 40 or more years. Besich and Schenck told me their vision
is for Superior to be a town with a mine, not a mining town. But is such
a thing even possible? In recent years, Superior has tried to position
itself as an outdoor recreation gateway to the many
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/lgnmqx/popular_oak_flat_climbing_sites_in_arizona_are/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climbing
routes</u></a> and hiking trails in the area. Yet I struggle to imagine
anyone would want to vacation or recreate so close to a massive mining
operation.
</p>
<p>
Muñoz believes Superior should throw itself entirely into tourism, which
brings in three times as much revenue as the copper industry in Arizona.
He dismissed arguments that losing the mine this far into negotiations
and preparations would set the town
<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/pinal/2021/04/14/superior-mayor-mila-besich-says-resolution-copper-mine-necessary-towns-success/7220885002/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>back
two decades</u></a>, telling me about a conversation he had with Vicky
Peacey, the president of Resolution Copper. “She said, ‘How do I tell my
300-plus employees that they don’t have a job?’” he recalled. “I said,
’The same way BHP told the 3,300 in San Manuel <em><em>they</em></em>
didn’t have a job. Magma Copper didn’t have a problem telling us we
didn’t have a job in ’82.”
</p>
<p>
Whatever gets decided about Oak Flat will reverberate far beyond
Superior, though. “We’ve got to keep our eyes on the prize,” Simon told
me. “And if the prize is mitigating human impacts on climate, and that
requires the energy transition, and that requires copper, and we have a
potential mine in Arizona that would provide 500,000 tons of copper
every year for decades — we need to do that.”
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
At the end of my day in Superior, I went with Muñoz and Delgado, another
former miner, to visit the haunted boarding house.
</p>
<p>
The renovated interior was surprisingly beautiful, decorated with
period-appropriate details like iron bed frames, clawfoot bathtubs, and
lace curtains that softened the harshness of the mid-afternoon light.
Though even the FEIS warns that “mining in Arizona has followed a ‘boom
and bust’ cycle, which potentially leads to great economic uncertainty,”
it was with a pang that I imagined the building one day falling back
into disrepair. It, and the town, had survived too much.
</p>
<p>
After peeking into Room 103, where Muñoz had passed his tipsy night all
those decades ago, we asked the friendly woman working the front desk if
she’d had any supernatural experiences herself — surely she’d seen the
mattress-flipping phantom, or swinging chandeliers, or perhaps a
<a href="https://copperarea.com/white-boots-ghost-magma-mine/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>white-boot
miner</u></a> who’d come down from the hills?
</p>
<p>
To our disappointment, she shook her head. For now, whatever ghosts
there once might have been in Superior had gone.

says detained US sailor entered ‘without any type of document’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Caracas, Venezuela — A U.S. Navy sailor held in Venezuela since late
last month was arrested for entering “without any type of document,” the
South American country’s attorney general said Thursday.</p>
<p>An American official on Wednesday announced the sailor had been
detained at a time of soaring tensions between Washington and Caracas in
the aftermath of disputed elections in Venezuela, with the opposition
party claiming it can prove were stolen.</p>
<p>In his first comments on the matter, Venezuelan Attorney General
Tarek William Saab said the sailor “entered without any type of
document, without any means of subsistence for what he came to do in the
country.”</p>
<p>He said the sailor held dual U.S. and Mexican nationalities.</p>
<p>For its part, the Pentagon said the sailor had been in Venezuela on
“personal travel.”</p>
<p>“This wasn’t something that was authorized,” Deputy Pentagon Press
Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters.</p>
<p>“The U.S. Navy is looking into this. We’re working with the State
Department,” she said, adding that: “Of course, we’d like to see the
sailor returned home.”</p>
<p>Venezuela was rocked by protests after President Nicolas Maduro was
declared the winner of a disputed July 28 election, with 25 civilians
and two soldiers killed and more than 2,400 people arrested.</p>
<p>The opposition claims it won by a landslide, and the United States,
the European Union and several Latin American countries have refused to
recognize Maduro’s claimed victory without seeing detailed voting
results.</p>
<p>On Monday, Washington seized Maduro’s plane in the Dominican Republic
and flew it to Florida, a move the Venezuelan leader condemned as
“piracy” but which Washington said was necessary due to sanctions
violations.</p>
<p>The following day, Washington denounced an arrest warrant issued for
opposition presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia and warned of
further action against Maduro.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department has warned Americans against traveling to
Venezuela for reasons including crime, unrest and wrongful
detention.</p>

id="in-haiti-blinken-announces-45-million-new-aid-calls-for-renewed-security-mission-mandate">In
Haiti, Blinken announces $45 million new aid, calls for renewed security
mission mandate</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Port-au-Prince, Haiti — During a trip to Haiti on Thursday, U.S.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced $45 million in new
humanitarian aid for the Caribbean nation, which has been wracked by
violence for years.  </p>
<p>He also called for the renewal of the United Nations mandate for the
Multinational Security Support, or MSS, mission to combat the armed
gangs that dominate much of the capital.</p>
<p>“At this critical moment, you do need more funding. We do need more
personnel to sustain and carry out the objectives of this mission,”
Blinken told a news conference on a rare visit to Port-au-Prince.</p>
<p>The top U.S. diplomat said he plans to convene a ministerial meeting
at the coming U.N. General Assembly to encourage greater international
contributions to address Haiti’s security, economic, and humanitarian
needs.</p>
<p>The MSS mandate is set to expire at the beginning of October.  U.S.
President Joe Biden’s administration is reportedly exploring the
possibility of changing the mission into a traditional U.N. peacekeeping
operation, a move that would ease funding, provide more equipment and
enable use of military forces rather than only police officers.</p>
<p>Blinken said that while the MSS mission itself needs to be renewed,
it also needs to ensure that it is “reliable” and “sustainable.”</p>
<p>“A peacekeeping operation would be one such option.  I think there
are others,” he told reporters on Thursday.</p>
<p>Blinken’s visit to Port-au-Prince underscores U.S. support for Haiti
as the country grapples with gang violence.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Blinken met with Edgard Leblanc Fils from Haiti’s
Transitional Presidential Council.</p>
<p>“Both concurred on the critical need to make timely advancements on
election preparations,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller
said.</p>
<p>Apart from Fils, Blinken also held talks with Prime Minister Garry
Conille, MSS head Godfrey Otunge and Normil Rameau, head of the Haitian
National Police.</p>
<p>The United States and Canada are the top funders of the MSS in Haiti.
The first-year estimated cost for the mission is $589 million. The U.S.
has already provided $309 million — $200 million toward the MSS mission
base and $109 million in financial support.</p>
<p>Gang-related violence and drug trafficking have fueled political
instability and insecurity in Haiti, leading to unbearable conditions
for Haitians.</p>
<p>At least 80% of Port-au-Prince is no longer under Haitian
authorities’ control, with violence spreading to other parts of the
country.</p>
<p>In the past year, displacement in Haiti has tripled as gang violence
grips the Caribbean nation. The U.N. says at least 578,000 people have
been displaced because of violence, including murders, kidnappings and
rapes.</p>
<p>The situation is further exacerbated by widespread hunger, with
nearly half the 11.7 million population facing acute food
insecurity.</p>
<p> After Haiti, Blinken arrived in Santo Domingo later Thursday.  His
visit follows the start of Dominican Republic President Luis Abinader’s
second term in mid-August.    </p>
<p>The Dominican Republic will host the 2025 Summit of the Americas,
where Western Hemisphere leaders will address shared challenges and
policy issues facing the region.  </p>

<p>date: 2024-09-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>state department — During a trip to Haiti on Thursday, U.S. Secretary
of State Antony Blinken announced $45 million in new humanitarian aid

years.</p>
<p>“At this critical moment, you do need more funding. We do need more

Blinken told a news conference on a rare visit there.</p>
<p>During the visit, Blinken also called for renewing a U.N. mandate for
an international security mission to Haiti to fight armed gangs that
control much of the country’s capital.</p>
<p>The mandate, first approved for 12 months, is set to expire at the
beginning of October. Blinken said a U.N. peacekeeping mission could
help bring a more sustainable peace to Haiti.</p>
<p>“Much remains to be done, and we’re determined to continue,” he said.
“It’s starting to move.”</p>
<p>“The Haitian people, not Haitian gangs, will write the country’s
future,” Blinken said.</p>
<p>Blinken’s visit to Port-au-Prince underscores U.S. support for Haiti,
with additional humanitarian assistance anticipated as the country
grapples with gang violence.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Blinken also met with Edgard Leblanc Fils, the head of

<p>Blinken also will visit the Dominican Republic. His trip to Santo
Domingo follows the start of Dominican Republic President Luis
Abinader’s second term in mid-August.</p>
<p>A senior State Department official told reporters on Wednesday that
the United States is prioritizing efforts with its international
partners to set up a structure that ensures “a reliable source of
financing and staffing” for a security mission in Haiti.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration is reportedly considering
the possibility of transitioning a largely U.S.-funded multinational
security force into a traditional U.N. peacekeeping operation.</p>
<p>“A formal PKO [peacekeeping operation] is one of the ways that we
could accomplish that, but we’re looking at multiple ways to do that,”
said Brian Nichols, assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere
affairs.</p>
<p>With about a month left in the mandate of the U.N.-ratified,
Kenya-led Multinational Security Support Mission (MSS) in Haiti,
progress has been limited, and many pledges remain unfulfilled.</p>
<p>“The one-year anniversary of the mission is October 2, and we’re
going to work to ensure that it’s poised for success and renewal of its
mandate in whatever form that takes,” Nichols told VOA on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Multinational security assists police</p>
<p>Gang-related violence and drug trafficking have fueled political
instability and insecurity in Haiti, leading to an unbearable living
situation for the Haitian people.</p>
<p>In October 2022, Haiti requested the deployment of an international
force to assist the Haitian National Police in combating heavily armed
gangs and facilitating humanitarian aid. In October 2023, the U.N.
Security Council authorized the MSS.</p>
<p>The United States and Canada are the top funders of the MSS in Haiti.
The first-year estimated cost for the mission is $589 million. The U.S.
has already provided $309 million — $200 million toward the MSS mission
base and $109 million in financial support.</p>
<p>During a visit to Haiti in July, U.S. Ambassador to the United
Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield announced an additional $60 million in
humanitarian assistance for the Haitian people, along with providing
armored vehicles for the national police.</p>
<p>Apart from Fils, Blinken met with MSS head Godfrey Otunge and was
also to meet Prime Minister Garry Conille and Normil Rameau, head of the
Haitian National Police.</p>
<p>Gang violence grips nation</p>
<p>At least 80% of Port-au-Prince is no longer under the control of the
Haitian authorities, with violence spreading to other parts of the
country.</p>
<p>In the past year, displacement in Haiti has tripled as gang violence
grips the Caribbean nation. The United Nations reports that at least
578,000 people have been displaced due to violence, which includes
murders, kidnappings and rapes.</p>
<p>The situation is exacerbated by widespread hunger, with nearly half
the 11.7 million population facing acute food insecurity.</p>
<p>Gangs, some aligned with political elites, accumulated their control
over territory and illicit markets during the tenure of the unpopular
former Prime Minister Ariel Henry, who took office after the
assassination of President Jovenel Moise in July 2021, according to a
Congressional Research Service report.</p>
<p>Henry resigned in April 2024 following the formation of a
Transitional Presidential Council.</p>

of Georgia school shooting suspect arrested on murder, manslaughter
charges</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WINDER, Ga. — The father of a 14-year-old boy accused of fatally
shooting four people at a Georgia high school and wounding nine others
was arrested Thursday and faces charges including second-degree murder
and involuntary manslaughter for allowing his son to possess a weapon,
authorities said.</p>
<p>It’s the latest example of prosecutors holding parents responsible
for their children’s actions in school shootings. In April, Michigan
parents Jennifer and James Crumbley were the first to be convicted in a
U.S. mass school shooting. They were sentenced to at least 10 years in
prison for not securing a firearm at home and acting indifferently to
signs of their son’s deteriorating mental health before he killed four
students in 2021.</p>
<p>Colin Gray, 54, the father of Colt Gray, was charged with four counts
of involuntary manslaughter, two counts of second-degree murder and
eight counts of cruelty to children, Georgia Bureau of Investigation
Director Chris Hosey said at a news conference.</p>
<p>“These charges stem from Mr. Gray knowingly allowing his son, Colt,
to possess a weapon,” Hosey said. “His charges are directly connected
with the actions of his son and allowing him to possess a weapon.”</p>
<p>In Georgia, second-degree murder means that a person has caused the
death of another person while committing second-degree cruelty to
children. It is punishable by 10 to 30 years in prison. Involuntary
manslaughter means that someone unintentionally causes the death of
another person.</p>
<p>Authorities have charged 14-year-old Colt Gray as an adult with
murder in the shootings Wednesday at Apalachee High School outside
Atlanta. Arrest warrants obtained by the AP accuse him of using a
semiautomatic assault-style rifle in the attack, which killed two
students and two teachers and wounded nine other people.</p>
<p>The teen denied threatening to carry out a school shooting when
authorities interviewed him last year about a menacing post on social
media, according to a sheriff’s report obtained Thursday.</p>
<p>Conflicting evidence on the post’s origin left investigators unable
to arrest anyone, the report said. Jackson County Sheriff Janis Mangum
said she reviewed the report from May 2023 and found nothing that would
have justified bringing charges at the time.</p>
<p>“We did all we could do with what we had at the time,” Mangum told
The Associated Press in an interview.</p>
<p>When a sheriff’s investigator from neighboring Jackson County
interviewed Gray last year, his father said the boy had struggled with
his parents’ separation and often got picked on at school. The teen
frequently fired guns and hunted with his father.</p>
<p>“He knows the seriousness of weapons and what they can do, and how to
use them and not use them,” Colin Gray said according to a transcript
obtained from the sheriff’s office.</p>
<p>The teen was interviewed after the sheriff received a tip from the
FBI that Colt Gray, then 13, “had possibly threatened to shoot up a
middle school tomorrow.” The threat was made on Discord, a social media
platform popular with video gamers, according to the sheriff’s office
incident report.</p>
<p>The FBI’s tip pointed to a Discord account associated with an email
address linked to Colt Gray, the report said. But the boy said “he would
never say such a thing, even in a joking manner,” according to the
investigator’s report.</p>
<p>The investigator wrote that no arrests were made because of
“inconsistent information” on the Discord account, which had profile
information in Russian and a digital evidence trail indicating it had
been accessed in different Georgia cities as well as Buffalo, New
York.</p>
<p>The attack was the latest among dozens of school shootings across the
U.S. in recent years, including especially deadly ones in Newtown,
Connecticut; Parkland, Florida; and Uvalde, Texas. The classroom
killings have set off fervent debates about gun control and frayed the
nerves of parents whose children are growing up accustomed to
active-shooter drills. But there has been little change to national gun
laws.</p>
<p>Classes were canceled Thursday at the Georgia high school, though
some people came to leave flowers around the flagpole and kneel in the
grass with heads bowed.</p>
<p>Gray was being held Thursday at a regional youth detention facility.
His first court appearance was scheduled for Friday morning.</p>
<p>He has been charged in the deaths of students Mason Schermerhorn and
Christian Angulo, both 14, and teachers Richard Aspinwall, 39, and
Christina Irimie, 53, according to Hosey.</p>
<p>At least nine other people — eight students and one teacher at the
school in Winder — were wounded and taken to hospitals. All were
expected to survive, Barrow County Sheriff Jud Smith said.</p>
<p>It was the 30th mass killing in the U.S. so far this year, according
to a database maintained by The Associated Press and USA Today in
partnership with Northeastern University. At least 127 people have died
in those killings, which are defined as events in which four or more
people die within a 24-hour period, not including the killer — the same
definition used by the FBI.</p>

<h2 id="who-is-alleged-chinese-agent-linda-sun">Who is alleged Chinese
agent Linda Sun?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Linda Sun, the Chinese American political aide accused
this week of acting as an agent of Beijing, rose rapidly in New York
state politics on her way to a job as deputy chief of staff to Governor
Kathy Hochul.</p>
<p>She climbed the ladder with stints as public relations director to a
Taiwanese American member of Congress and an assignment as the deputy
chief diversity officer in the office of the previous governor.</p>
<p>But according to the indictment made public this week, she used her
position to tamp down public criticism of China’s treatment of its
Uyghur minority and to prevent interactions between Taiwanese government
officials and senior New York state officials.</p>
<p>In return, the indictment alleges, Beijing rewarded her with millions
of dollars in bribes and business deals.</p>
<p>Sun and her husband, Chris Hu, were arrested Tuesday, accused of
violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act by illegally acting as
agents of the Chinese government. Other charges include visa fraud,
alien smuggling and money laundering conspiracy. Hu was also charged
with conspiracy to commit bank fraud and abuse of identification.</p>
<p>Court appearance</p>
<p>The two naturalized U.S. citizens made their first appearance in U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn on
Tuesday. During the arraignment, they pleaded not guilty and were
released on a combined $2 million bail. They are not allowed to travel
outside New York, New Hampshire and Maine.</p>
<p>In a statement shared with VOA Mandarin, Chinese Embassy spokesperson
Liu Pengyu dismissed the allegations.</p>
<p>“I am not aware of the specific details. But in recent years, the
U.S. government and media have frequently hyped up the so-called
‘Chinese agents’ narratives, many of which have later been proven
untrue,” he said.</p>
<p>He added that “China requires its citizens overseas to comply with
the laws and regulations of the host country, and we firmly oppose the
groundless slandering and smearing targeting China.”</p>
<p>Barnard graduate</p>
<p>Sun was born in China in 1983 and moved to the U.S. with her parents
at age 5. She is fluent in Chinese.</p>
<p>She got her undergraduate degree in political science from Barnard
College in 2006. According to a campus magazine, she first got involved
in public service at age 8 by translating forms and filing tax returns
for her parents.</p>
<p>She obtained her master’s degree in education from Columbia
University in 2009, but her path turned to politics.</p>
<p>In 2008, she met Grace Meng, the U.S. representative for New York’s
6th Congressional District. Meng was campaigning at the time and was
said to be impressed by Sun’s energy and initiative.</p>
<p>Sun joined Meng’s campaign as public relations director and then
became chief of staff for the Taiwanese American congresswoman.</p>
<p>In 2012, Sun became the director of Asian American Affairs and Queens
regional representative in the governor’s office. She also served as the
deputy chief diversity officer in former New York Governor Andrew
Cuomo’s administration from 2018 to 2020 and then was deputy chief of
staff to Hochul from 2021 to 2022.</p>
<p>Alleged effort to silence</p>
<p>As a deputy chief diversity officer, she called on ethnic minorities
to have a seat at the table through government programs.</p>
<p>However, according to the indictment, Sun sought to silence voices in
the U.S. speaking out for China’s Uyghur Muslim minority, whom the
Chinese government has long been accused of oppressing. She allegedly
had an argument with Hochul’s speechwriter, who had insisted the
then-lieutenant governor should mention the Uyghur situation in China in
a Lunar New Year speech to the Chinese American community.</p>
<p>The indictment said Sun successfully prevented Taiwanese government
officials, including former Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, from
interacting with senior New York state officials, while facilitating
Chinese delegations’ trips to the U.S. with fraudulent invitation
letters.</p>
<p>In return for Sun’s political assistance, the indictment says, the
Chinese government financially rewarded her with millions of dollars and
aided Hu’s commercial activities in China.</p>
<p>Using the illegal funds, the couple is alleged to have bought a 2024
Ferrari, a $2.1 million apartment in Hawaii and a $3.55 million Long
Island single-family home.</p>
<p>Sun and Hu are scheduled to next appear in court on September 25.</p>
